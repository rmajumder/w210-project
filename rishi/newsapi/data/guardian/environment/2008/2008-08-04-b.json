  "<p>Officials in Texas defied the international court of justice last night to affirm the scheduled execution today of a Mexican national at the centre of a global legal row. </p> <p>The state's board of parole and corrections rejected a last minute appeal from lawyers for Jos\u00e9 Medell\u00edn.</p> <p>He is now scheduled to be put to death at 6pm local time despite an order from the court at The Hague to halt his execution. </p> <p>Legal experts and human rights organisations said the execution would be seen as an act of defiance of international law after a ruling from the ICJ that Medell\u00edn was denied his right to consult with Mexican embassy officials during his trial.</p> <p>\"US respect for international law might be further damaged by this execution,\" said Brian Evans of Amnesty International.</p> <p>\"We are deeply disappointed with this recommendation from the board of pardons and paroles,\" said Donald Francis Donovan of Debevoise &amp; Plimpton LLP, counsel to Medell\u00edn\ufeff \"The board has failed to support the United States in fulfilling its international legal obligations. The board's action ... risks the safety of thousands of Americans travelling and living abroad.</p> <p>Katharine Huffman, a spokeswoman for Medell\u00edn's legal team, said the case was being monitored by the international community. \"The failure on the part of the US could have very serious implications for our relationship with Mexico as well as other nations,\" she said.</p> <p>But the governor of Texas, Rick Perry, has repeatedly indicated the execution would go ahead. Texas has the most active death chamber in America.</p> <p>\"The [ICJ] has no jurisdiction here in Texas. We're concerned about following Texas law and that's what we're doing,\" a spokeswoman for Perry said.</p> <p>Medell\u00edn has spent most of his adult life on death row after he was convicted in the 1993 gang rape and murders of two teenage girls.</p> <p>His hopes now rest on the US supreme court. His lawyers had asked the board for a 240-day stay of execution to give Congress time to enact legislation that would spare him. </p> <p>A bill now before Congress would compel Texas and other states to comply with international treaties guaranteeing foreign nationals on trial the right to consult with officials from their home countries.</p> <p>Medell\u00edn is the first of 51 Mexicans on death row in the US whose cases have become an embarrassment for the Bush administration. </p> <p>In a 2004 ruling the ICJ ordered the courts to grant a review of their cases, and George Bush earlier this year urged the authorities in Texas to revisit Medell\u00edn's case. But the supreme court ruled that the president had overstepped his authority.</p> <p>Last month the ICJ ordered the US to \"take all measures necessary\" to block Medell\u00edn's execution. Huffman warned that America could still be in conflict with the court until the cases of the other 50 Mexican nationals on death row are resolved.</p>",
  "<p>Unless philanthropists start donating to universities, as well as museums and galleries, the jewel in the crown of UK higher education stands to lose its sheen, the outgoing head of the University of the Arts London warned last week.</p> <p>Sir Michael Bichard's parting shot was a plea for private donors to do much more to support the future artists and creative professionals - such as those trained by colleges in London - rather than those of yesteryear. While there is a growing trend for philanthropy in the UK, particularly in the arts, there is still not enough going to universities, he argues.</p> <p>Will a new \u00a3200m government scheme to match the funding universities raise in endowments over the next three years make the difference? As of last Friday, any cash donations or contributions from smaller charitable trusts and foundations that universities receive will be eligible for matched funding, but the rules of the new game are fiendishly complicated. </p> <p><strong>Complex system</strong></p> <p>Over the past few months, universities have had to choose between \"tiers\" of risk, which have different private to public funding ratios, depending on how much they expect to raise. For example, a university in the second tier that raises \u00a34m would receive an extra \u00a32m from the government. </p> <p>There is still no news on what caps will be set on the amount of money to be had from each tier. Universities opting for the top tier will have to raise most in order to win government money. But the top tier cap will be set at a higher level, so they stand to gain more in the total amount of funding available to them.</p> <p>In 2006-07, universities' endowment and investment income reached \u00a3391m, with more than 50 institutions actively fundraising. Some of the UK's oldest universities have launched high-profile appeals with ambitious new targets. Cambridge is halfway to raising an additional \u00a31bn. Oxford hopes to pip that, and in May launched the biggest-ever fundraising drive by a European academic institution. It aims to raise \u00a31.25bn to pay for a major expansion and allow it to compete with US Ivy League universities.</p> <p>Edinburgh University's campaign to raise \u00a3350m by 2011 seems modest by comparison, but it's the third biggest in the UK and by far the largest in Scotland. It has raised nearly \u00a3250m already.</p> <p>While the new match-funding scheme doesn't extend to Scotland, the Scottish government's push to turn the country into a knowledge economy has helped universities there, according to Edinburgh's vice-principal for development, Young P Dawkins: \"We're about to open a new informatics building, important in the area of artificial intelligence, with a major contribution from government. That allowed us to ask others in the private sector to match-fund that support.\" </p> <p>And Dawkins thinks the culture of giving is shifting but universities shouldn't focus solely on philanthropists: \"There's a community of funders who have an interest in sustaining higher education, including government, large foundations, corporations and individuals. Our job is to make the case about why that public-private partnership is so powerful.</p> <p>\"It's also important for us to demonstrate that tangible benefit - in buildings; through scholarships that bring the brightest students in the UK here regardless of circumstance; and endowing professorships to bring the leading scholars from around the world here.\"</p> <p>Former polytechnics represented by the Million+ group have a harder time raising funds. \"We have 100,000 graduates. I don't know how many Oxbridge have, but it's a lot more than that,\" says Helen Bond, Coventry University's development manager. \"They've been doing it for more years and have more experience, but our case for support is no less. In a climate of limited state funding and increasing global competition, fundraising is more and more vital.\"</p> <p>She says the government scheme will help hugely. \"Any money we now raise will be worth more.\"</p> <p><strong>More private funding</strong></p> <p>Universities need to raise more private funding and be more professional about it, says Bichard. The University of the Arts London (UoAL) has been in surplus for about the last 16 years, but most of that money is spent on buildings.</p> <p>\"We are seen to be one of the most financially secure universities in the country, but we inherited some pretty inadequate buildings, which we are trying to replace. Resources for teaching and staff lose out,\" he says. Bichard claims Central Saint Martins' new campus at Kings Cross will become one of London's great buildings, with at least as much cachet as Tate Britain, which has captured public hearts and purses in a way universities have so far largely failed to do.</p> <p>UoAL fundraises around \u00a33m a year. The new campus will cost \u00a3180m, precious little of which has come from endowments. \"We'll recover it from selling existing properties, but \u00a3100m will have to come from borrowing or gifts,\" Bichard explains. \"I had hoped it would be something people would want to rally around - the biggest new art college in Europe in recent years - but so far we haven't had great success. It's very early days but I'm hoping that will unlock peoples' enthusiasm for what we're doing here.</p> <p>\"Universities have to 'fess up to the fact that they could be a lot more professional about raising money. There is philanthropic giving in the UK, and in the arts, but it doesn't seem to recognise the importance of an institution like this.\"</p> <p>He points to the US, whose universities are known for being very well endowed, but also to increasing competition from China, which recognises the importance of creative skills and industry, with huge investment in universities from government and the private sector. \"We are competing against China and the US. We don't have the resources to continue to be the best art and design learning centre in the world in the future,\" he warns. \"More people have to invest in our institutions, they can't just expect government to do it.\"</p>",
  "<p>The <strong>FTSE 100</strong> was dragged into negative territory yesterday by an ailing mining sector and banking group <strong>HSBC</strong>'s profit slump.

Shell closed down 14p to \u00a317.36, while <strong>BP</strong> fell 3.25p to 518p.</p> <p><strong>Punch Taverns</strong>, Britain's largest pub landlord with an 8,400-strong estate, was the biggest gainer in the FTSE 250 index following a report that it could be the subject of a private equity bid. Punch shares have fallen 70% in the past year as the company deals with the effects of the smoking ban, competition from supermarkets and the impact of the credit crunch.</p> <p>Yesterday the shares were up 21%, or 54.5p to 312p, after it was reported that CVC Capital Partners was considering a bid.</p> <p>That news lifted Punch's rivals. <strong>Mitchells &amp; Butlers</strong>, which owns chains such as Harvester and Toby Carvery, was up 25.25p, or 10%, to 280.75p, while <strong>Enterprise Inns</strong> gained 9p to 320.25p. The <strong>JD Wetherspoon</strong> chain was another gainer, 14.25p to 233.25p.</p> <p>Brewing group <strong>SABMiller</strong> added 27p to \u00a310.66 despite JP Morgan cutting its target to \u00a313.10.</p> <p><strong>Imperial Energy</strong> rose 86p to \u00a311.60 as it confirmed it had entered talks with a second potential buyer, believed to be China's Sinopec. It is discussing a \u00a31.3bn takeover with another, unnamed suitor, thought to be India's Oil and Natural Gas Company.</p> <p>Nuclear power group <strong>British Energy</strong> gained 18p to 718p as British Gas owner <strong>Centrica</strong> confirmed its renewed interest in a takeover. Centrica, which had already examined the possibility of an all-paper offer for British Energy, lifted 0.25p to 297.25p.</p> <p>Shares in <strong>International Power </strong>were up 14p to 417.75p after it clinched a deal in Indonesia. PT Paiton Energy, in which IP has a 40.5% stake, signed a 30-year agreement with the country's state utility to develop a coal-fired plant that will become operational in 2012.</p> <p><strong>Trinity Mirror</strong> added 14.5p to 115p, a 14% rise that made it the second-biggest percentage gainer in the FTSE 250. Lehman analyst Tamsin Garrity raised its rating to equal weight and set a target of 135p. She made the assessment after last week's interim results in which Trinity revealed it had taken an \u00a385m impairment charge to reflect a deterioration in the advertising environment. The company said the fall in advertising revenue had worsened in July, to 15%. </p> <p>\"Given that we believe the double-digit declines in advertising are now priced in, that the risks surrounding pension funding have been mitigated and management is aggressively tackling costs, we believe that there is little near-term downside in the stock,\" she wrote. </p> <p>Rival newspaper group <strong>Johnston Press</strong> gained no benefit from Trinity's upgrade, however. </p> <p>The decision by UBS last week to slash its target from 75p to 50p appeared to be dragging the stock down further as it fell 6.5p to 40p. The 14% decline was the biggest in the FTSE 250.</p> <p>Elsewhere in the media sector, <strong>ITV </strong>was up 0.7p to 43.5p in spite of Investec reducing its target to 35p. </p> <p>The independent broadcaster, which like newspaper groups is struggling with the stagnant advertising market, releases first-half results tomorrow. </p> <p>\"While further cost cuts are now likely, the near-term investment case is driven by potential for takeover as opposed to fundamentals, which appear to be declining,\" wrote Investec analyst Steve Liechti. </p> <p>However, he noted that speculation about potential predators had \"died down slightly\".</p> <h2>A swing to Sorrell</h2> <p>Market research group <strong>Taylor Nelson Sofres</strong> slipped 0.25p to 270p as Panmure cut its recommendation on the shares to \"hold\". Panmure warned of \"<strong>major doubts</strong>\" that TNS's former merger partner, the German group <strong>GfK</strong>, would come up with the necessary cash to counter the unsolicited bid already made by <strong>WPP</strong>, the advertising empire led by <strong>Sir Martin Sorrell</strong>. On Friday night WPP sent TNS shareholders details of its cash-and-shares proposal, which values the company at <strong>264p</strong> a share.

  "<p>Belgian-Dutch banking group Fortis yesterday reported a 41% drop in first-half profits after taking a fresh hit from the credit market turmoil.</p> <p>Net profit plunged to \u20ac1.6bn (\u00a31.3bn)from \u20ac2.8bn in the first six months of last year, after a \u20ac591m write-down mainly due to the bank's exposure to mortgage-backed securities. Excluding this impact, profits were down 21%.</p> <p>\"We should be aware that the credit crisis is not behind us yet,\" warned acting chief executive Herman Verwilst. </p> <p>He said that strengthening the group's balance sheet was \"the top priority of senior management today\".</p> <p>Verwilst said Fortis could raise an additional \u20ac4bn in capital by selling debt and non-core Fortis and ABN assets. </p> <p>\"We think the bulk of the effort in the coming months is going to come from the divestment of non-core assets,\" said Verwilst. </p> <p>\"We have identified the list - we have appointed investment bankers.\"Verwilst added that the underlying performance of the business was \"satisfactory\" in light of market turbulence. </p> <p>\"Most of the commercial activities were still able to grow underlying revenue. But we observe that the environment is becoming more difficult on different fronts.\"</p> <p>The figures were better than analysts expected, but the cautious tone of Verwilst's comments drove down the shares by 3.2% to \u20ac9 on the Amsterdam stock exchange. Fortis's market value of \u20ac21bn is now less than the \u20ac24bn it paid for Dutch bank ABN Amro's retail and wealth management activities last autumn, in a takeover led by Royal Bank of Scotland.</p> <p>Last month, Belgium's biggest bank caved in to shareholder pressure and announced its chief executive, Jean-Paul Votron, was stepping down owing to problems related to the US sub-prime crisis. In a further board shake-up, finance director Gilbert Mittler was ousted last Friday. </p> <p>Investors were angered in June when Fortis scrapped its half-year dividend and raised a further \u20ac1.5bn of equity as part of a surprise \u20ac8.3bn capital-raising programme. Three weeks ago Fortis was forced to deny customers were withdrawing funds as its shares plunged.</p> <p>The bank undertook Europe's second-largest rights issue, worth \u20ac13.4bn, to fund its share of the ABN Amro acquisition. The consortium that bought ABN for \u20ac71bn, which included Spain's Santander, has been criticised for overpaying at a time when the global credit crisis had started to unfold.</p>",
  "<p>BP's grip on its Russian joint venture was loosened significantly yesterday when one of its few remaining appointees - James Owen, the chief financial officer - resigned abruptly.</p> <p>With Robert Dudley, chief executive of TNK-BP and another of BP's men, out of Moscow, the balance of power has shifted towards BP's partners but bitter rivals - the four Russian billionaires who own 50% of the venture. </p> <p>There is now only one BP-nominated executive - chief operating officer Tim Summers - at the top of the Siberian oil and gas company, with two nominated by the rival private shareholders from the Alfa-Access-Renova (AAR) consortium.</p> <p>Dudley remains chief executive but few expect him to return to Russia after fleeing what he claims was personal harassment. Many expect him to step down shortly.</p> <p>BP refused to comment on the latest upheaval, but TNK-BP released a formal statement that said: \"Mr Owen's [resignation] letter states that as the current shareholder issues remain unresolved he feels it is difficult for him to continue working independently, as his role demands.\"</p> <p>There was an unusually upbeat comment from the Russian shareholders. </p> <p>\"Jim Owen has made a significant contribution to the development of TNK-BP and we regret to see him go,\" said Stan Polovets, chief executive of AAR. </p> <p>\"During two and a half years with the company, Jim has built a strong organisation underneath him and we expect to have a smooth transition as TNK-BP considers candidates for the CFO job. We wish Jim all the best as he pursues new endeavours.\" </p> <p>The resignation comes days after Tony Hayward, BP's chief executive, held talks with Mikhail Fridman, one of the venture's four main Russian shareholders, to try to resolve the crisis.</p> <p>Two of those shareholders, Viktor Vekselberg and German Kahn, hold senior management positions at TNK-BP and their umbrella group, AAR, had said that they would step down if BP agreed to withdraw Dudley. </p> <p>Hayward admitted at BP's second-quarter results conference last week that Dudley's position - working from outside of Russia - was sustainable only for a few months.</p> <p>BP has always claimed that it was Dudley's decision to leave Russia and that his position as chief executive at TNK-BP will be supported at all costs. But many industry experts believe it is only a matter of time before Dudley agrees to leave the company, which provides BP with a quarter of its global oil and gas production but only a tenth of its profits.</p> <p>BP and AAR have been fighting over control of TNK-BP for six months, amid expectations that one or both sides will eventually have to sell their stake to the Kremlin. </p> <p>The company has spent the past year fighting off claims from the tax, environmental and immigration authorities in what has been seen by some industry specialists as a rerun of the kind of problems that afflicted Shell until it sold part of its shareholding in Sakhalin to state-owned Gazprom. But in recent months the Russian private shareholders have accused BP of running the joint venture for its own ends, something that the British company denies.</p>",
  "<p>The Portuguese police file on the disappearance of Madeleine McCann was made public last night, leading her parents to hope that the leaks and innuendo they have endured for 15 months may finally be at an end.</p> <p>The file showed that a British scientist had warned that tests on DNA recovered from Kate and Gerry McCann's hire car had been inconclusive days before the couple were formally named as suspects.</p> <p>It also shows that during a subsequent interview with Portuguese police, Mrs McCann refused to answer 48 questions about her daughter, apparently fearing they were intended to implicate her in the girl's disappearance.</p> <p>Other notes showed that detectives told Mr McCann that Madeleine's DNA had been found in their hire car. Although the questioning on September 7 was not recorded, an unidentified police officer took notes which were included in the dossier. </p> <p>The officer wrote that Mr McCann was told his daughter's DNA was discovered in the boot of the rented Renault Scenic and behind a sofa in the family's holiday apartment. The notes said: \"Confronted with the fact that Madeleine's DNA was gathered from behind the sofa and from the boot of the vehicle, and analysed by a British laboratory, he said he could not explain why this would be.\" </p> <p>This contradicted the Forensic Science Service (FSS) expert's opinion that the sample found in the car could not be definitively linked to the little girl. </p> <p>Clarence Mitchell, spokesman for the 40-year-olds from Rothley, Leicestershire, said: \"You have to ask what the police were trying to achieve by over-presenting evidence that they did not have, and clearly could not claim to have.\"</p> <p>Among other material released were photographs showing the room where Madeleine had been left by her parents when they went out to dine with friends nearby. Compact discs containing 17 files running to 11,223 pages were released by court officials in the town of Portim\u00e3o, near to where the child vanished, after a period of segredo de justi\u00e7a, or secrecy of justice, was lifted following the decision to close the case.</p> <p>Some information is thought to have been edited out, including the identities of any convicted or suspected paedophiles living in the Algarve at the time Madeleine disappeared.</p> <p>Madeleine was nearly four when she vanished from her family's holiday apartment in the Algarve resort of Praia da Luz on May 3 last year. Despite the lengthy police inquiry and global publicity, no clues to her possible whereabouts were ever uncovered.</p> <p>Last month Portuguese prosecutors said they were shelving the case, although it can be reopened if new evidence comes to light. At that time, the McCanns and an Algarve resident, Robert Murat, were told they were no longer formal suspects in Madeleine's disappearance. All three denied any involvement.</p> <p>The files released yesterday include an email written on September 3 2007 by John Lowe, from the Forensic Science Service in Birmingham, warning that it was impossible to conclude whether DNA from the Renault Scenic, hired 25 days after Madeleine disappeared, came directly from the missing girl. Lowe told Detective Superintendent Stuart Prior, head of the British side of the investigation, that the results were \"too complex for meaningful interpretation or inclusion\".</p> <p>Lowe wrote: \"Let's look at the question that is being asked: 'Is there DNA from Madeleine on the swab?' It would be very simple to say 'yes' simply because of the number of components within the result that are also in her reference sample. </p> <p>\"What we need to consider, as scientists, is whether the match is genuine - because Madeleine has deposited DNA as a result of being in the car or whether Madeleine merely appears to match the result by chance.\" </p> <p>The components of the missing girl's DNA profile were not unique to her; in fact some were present among FSS scientists, including himself. He wrote: \"We cannot answer the question: is the match genuine, or is it a chance match?\"</p> <p>The warning was passed to the Portuguese police the following day. Despite this, the McCanns were identified as suspects. Mitchell said yesterday: \"The search for Madeleine goes on. Kate and Gerry ... know there is a possibility that Madeleine could be dead, and could be long dead. However, there is absolutely no evidence that she is dead.\"</p>",
  "<p>When writers judge his tone, the word \"thunderous\" comes to mind. When historians consider the impact of One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, The First Circle, Cancer Ward and The Gulag Archipelago, Alexander Solzhenitsyn's denunciation of the Soviet labour camp system achieves monumental proportions. For much of the century that he came to dominate, he was simply Russia's greatest writer.</p> <p>Solzhenitsyn, who died at the age of 89 at his home outside Moscow on Sunday, survived the Soviet Union by nearly 17 years. And yet it is an abiding irony of his literary life that nothing he wrote in freedom, either in exile in Vermont or in post-Soviet Russia, achieved the status of those banned manuscripts smuggled out on microfilm to the west. There, he was compared to Anna Akhmatova or Boris Pasternak. As a literary victim of a repressive system with no news, his work achieved an intensity of truth that reached a global audience and shook the Soviet system to its core. As a free man in a country inundated with news and changing daily, the messianic figure with a long beard was simply bemused. </p> <p>Solzhenitsyn had his Soviet citizenship restored in 1990, but he took four more years to return to Russia, ignoring entreaties by President Boris Yeltsin to come back sooner. In that time he completed his historical cycle of the Russian Revolution, The Red Wheel, which critics called wooden in more ways than one. Solzhenitsyn was mortified by the reception it got. His return to Russia was another grand statement that misfired. He landed in Magadan, a former Gulag outpost and embarked on a seven-week train journey, partly paid for by the BBC, across the expanse of Russia to reacquaint himself with the motherland. He railed against privatisation and the degradation of the Russian language, but failed to communicate to a people who had their other eye on western brand names. He was irritated that few he met in the country that he had helped liberate had read his books. A television chatshow which Solzhenitsyn hosted was pulled when the questions got steadily longer than the answers.</p> <p>Russia's greatest refugee retreated to address future generations in a wooded retreat outside Moscow. He built a luxury dacha in Troitse-Lykovo on land once occupied by his KGB tormentors, and rarely emerged from behind its high fence. Solzhenitsyn found the closest reflection of his political views in Vladimir Putin, and the reclusive writer was once again being praised from the ramparts of the Kremlin. His last major work was a history of Russia and the Jews. A fiercely independent voice burned to the last inside a man who was rarely comfortable with his contemporary surroundings.</p>",
  "<p>Germaine Greer has fallen for a simplistic stereotype if she really believes that an ecohome needs to be built like a space station, topped with an array of solar panels (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/jul/28/architecture.ecotowns\">New houses are universally horrible, and ecohouses are the most horrible of the lot</a>, July 28). </p> <p>Ecohomes are as varied in design as any other buildings, and should not be bound by misguided perceptions. Yes, they can be like the shimmering, timber-clad duplexes you've seen in magazines, but they can also look like the house next door. </p> <p>Greer says: \"The builders of ecohouses accept as a given the basic shape and dropsical proportions of the two-storey suburban villa, with pitched roofs, end gables, front porch, picture windows, chimneys and so forth.\" This is bunkum. The main builders of ecohomes have, for years, been housing associations. And the only \"given\" that we work to is that ecohomes can be as varied as the communities they are based within.</p> <p>While many are integrated into local neighbourhoods, others are beacons of architectural innovation. A guide to green building we issued last year contains 37 case studies - each of them unique in design. The fact that Greer and many others seem not yet to realise this is perhaps testament to their design prejudices. So when Greer says, \"There is usually nothing about the ecohouse to signal that it is a new kind of energy-efficient machine for living in,\" I would ask: why on earth should there be?</p> <p>Greer then goes on to say, contradictorily, that \"the slate in the roof may be recycled, but with so many solar panels, skylights, sun tunnels and windows in it and on it, there's no good reason for it being made of slate at all\".</p> <p>Of course, these features are an important element in the ongoing and vital drive to make our housing greener, but they are only part of the picture. If Greer went to Drum Housing Association's recent development in Whitehill, Hampshire, she would see that, while the roofs are of a conventional appearance, they are in fact filled with fluid heated from the surrounding air, providing each home's entire central heating and hot water needs - ensuring a massive reduction in heating costs.</p> <p>These houses look good and save money. What's more, I'm confident that passers-by do not stare at them in amazement, thinking they have just arrived from another planet. </p> <p>Greer ends by raising the issue of the \"hidden extra cost\" of ecohomes. \"If less energy was spent on faking sameness,\" she muses, \"the costs could be kept down.\" This is a bizarre statement, with no evidence to back it up. </p> <p>There is indeed a concern about the costs of building ecohomes; however, all the evidence points to the fact that the market for green technology is not well developed because only housing associations are stepping up to the plate. </p> <p>The only way to deal with this is for ministers to compel private developers to build to the same high green and design standards as we housing associations do - and of course with just as much variation.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> David Orr is chief executive of the National Housing Federation <br><a href=\"mailto:davido@housing.org.uk\"><br>davido@housing.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>After months of western criticisms and Chinese counterattacks over issues such as human rights, Tibet, the environment and support for rogue regimes in Africa, the Olympics finally open this week. While many in the west will use the games to test their expectations of China, it is also a rare opportunity for the Chinese to test their expectations of the west.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Chinese citizens living overseas organised protests in France, Germany, the US, Canada, Australia and the UK. There was an outpouring of anger at the alleged bias of the western media's coverage of the Tibet issue and the Olympic torch relay. They charged that the western media did not accurately report the unrest in Tibet, and gave extensive coverage to the Tibet campaigners during the torch relay. They also took issue with the media's generalised statements, such as \"Tibetans are against Chinese rule\". The anger surprised many. Along with surprise came a search for explanations, but none of those proffered went beyond blaming China's surging nationalism. If Chinese government propaganda has shaped Chinese perception of the west, so has propaganda from the west itself.</p> <p>In a way, the west has been the victim of its own success. It has created high expectations about its behaviour, values and purposes. These protests result partly from a sense of disillusion among the Chinese youth. It is a backlash against the idea of a politically and morally superior west. The angry youths who protested against the west's biased coverage of Tibet and the Olympic torch relay had had their idealised views crushed. Their understanding of \"balanced\" reporting includes the highly unrealistic expectation that equal coverage would be given to every single perspective on every issue.</p> <p>Since the Chinese protests, I have witnessed many debates in which defenders of western media point out to Chinese critics that at least it is more objective and balanced than their own state-controlled media. This argument has not appeased anyone, and the reason is simple. They take it as a matter of course that Chinese media frequently serves as the government's mouthpiece, but they have very different expectations of western media. Hence their bitterness when they found it committing some of the same sins.</p> <p>Despite the Chinese state's effort to promote patriotism among its people, and the Chinese media's regular criticism of western policies, the west has been extremely successful in influencing how it is seen by ordinary Chinese people. Many not only take for granted that the west is more advanced in political, economic and social development, but they also subconsciously accept the west's moral superiority. They believe the west is more democratic, and that it possesses such virtues as fairness, tolerance, civility and open-mindedness. But the perceived western attempt to use the Olympics to bully China has led some to question their views.</p> <p>It is said that before the 1989 democracy movement, the west had a rosy picture of China, believing the country was gradually casting off communism to embrace democracy and the free market. Many have never recovered from the shock of finding out how wrong they had been, which led to the demonisation of China post-1989.</p> <p>Then again, many Chinese also had a rose-tinted view of the west. As globalisation and China's development brings Chinese people into closer contact with the west, there is the potential for a nasty backlash. Managing the expectations of the Chinese people is therefore an important task for western governments, media and NGOs if they don't want to see anti-western feelings grow.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Dr Yiyi Lu is an associate fellow of Chatham House's Asia programme <a href=\"http://www.chathamhouse.org.uk\">chathamhouse.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Mention the name of Sir Jim Rose, who is currently reviewing the primary curriculum, and the words \"safe pair of hands\" are never far behind. What does the phrase mean? \"I used to play a lot of rugby,\" he suggests, with a slightly embarrassed giggle. The record speaks for itself, however.</p> <p>In 1991, a Conservative government, close to a general election it would struggle to win, appointed Rose as one of \"three wise men\" to review the delivery of primary education. They concluded, to put it in shorthand, that child-centred or \"progressive\" teaching had gone too far, allowing the Tories to reinforce public prejudices about what leftist teachers and councils had done to primary schools. In 1999, Rose led an inquiry to consider whether Sats were being dumbed down to help New Labour achieve its targets for raising standards. Happily, it found, as David Blunkett, then the education secretary, put it in his diaries, \"precisely what we had expected ... there was no question of any kind of 'fiddling'\". In 2005, ministers asked Rose to consider how reading was taught. Pressure was growing from MPs and newspapers - but not from most academic experts on reading and early childhood education - for a wholesale return to phonics. Rose duly concluded that \"synthetic phonics offers the vast majority ... the best and most direct route to becoming skilled readers and writers\".</p> <p>This is probably an unfair summary, since all the reports contain nuances and qualifications, and most of what they say may be right. Moreover, by all accounts, the \"wise men\" of 1991 were split and Rose sat on the sidelines while the two protagonists, Chris Woodhead, later head of Ofsted, and the educational researcher Professor Robin Alexander slugged it out. But, each time, Rose caught the prevailing political wind.</p> <p>\"Jim has excellent political antennae,\" said a former colleague from HMI, which Rose joined in 1975. \"He's good at giving ministers what they want, but not necessarily what they need.\" If that sounds like damning with faint praise, Conor Ryan, a former New Labour education aide, puts it more kindly: \"He has both considerable integrity and a pragmatic sense of what's going to work. He can take on board a range of entrenched opinions and yet reach a consensus.\" John O'Leary, a former Times education editor and a member of the Sats inquiry, adds: \"He's worldly wise. He knows what he can get away with.\"</p> <p>At 69, Rose is still a lean and wiry man, who was good enough to be invited to join Leicester Tigers training squad in the days when rugby union was wholly amateur. He perhaps owes his ability to steer through clashing educational ideologies to playing as a scrum half, this position being a link between forwards and backs who are (or used to be) quite different animals, temperamentally and physically.</p> <p>The brief for his latest job is to \"strengthen their [schools'] focus on raising standards in reading, writing and numeracy\", introduce foreign languages, increase \"curriculum opportunities for child initiated and play-based activity\", and reduce prescription. All this must be achieved without changing the extent and nature of the testing regime, which is specifically excluded from Rose's remit. It sounds as though ministers want to allay parents' complaints about their children being over-pressured without upsetting the Daily Mail. No doubt, as they now say in educational circles, Jim'll fix it.</p> <p>The timing of the curriculum review is itself controversial. True, it follows a secondary curriculum review and the introduction of an early years \"foundation stage\" and you shouldn't, as Rose puts it, \"just extend one backwards, the other forwards, tie a knot in the middle and say that's primary education\". But the biggest primary review for 40 years, organised by a Cambridge University team independently of the government, under the former \"wise man\" Alexander, had been at work for a more than a year before Rose's review was announced in January. The Cambridge team's wide-ranging research got wide media coverage, sometimes on front pages. The headlines included \"Poor performance linked to substandard classrooms\", \"Government policy has created 'impersonalised education'\", \"Study reveals stressed out 7- to 11-year-olds\" and others apparently hostile to new Labour's policies and achievements. Now Rose's review appears with a suspiciously similar email address, a claim that it too is independent, and an identical deadline for its final report of spring 2009 (an interim report is due in October this year).</p> <p><strong>Spoiling operation?</strong></p> <p>Is this an attempt to spike Alexander's guns? \"There are very clear distinctions,\" replies Rose. \"His is a no-holds-barred look at primary education. Mine is simply the curriculum: the what rather than the how, or the measurement thereof. I've met Robin on several occasions and we've shared thoughts.\"</p> <p>Rose, just appointed (\"out of the blue,\" he says) as president of the National Foundation for Educational Research, is an affable man, but tends to talk as though framing an official report, tiptoeing through political minefields, striving to put the emphasis in exactly the right place. He is most categorical about the importance in his life of his two grandchildren - he and his wife sold a planned retirement home in Norfolk to be near them in the south-east - but even that he puts rather oddly, saying \"their formative stages of development were within our ambit\".</p> <p>He was born in Leicester a few months before the outbreak of the second world war, and the local accent is still distinct. His father, a quantity surveyor who also played in a brass band, joined the Rifle Brigade as a bandsman and was captured by the Germans in northern France. He was not released until 1945 and, for a time, was classified missing, presumed dead. The infant Jim was therefore reared by his mother, grandparents and a \"very book-focused\" aunt who read him stories in the air-raid shelter. He went to state primary schools and then grammar school. His first ambition, derived from his grandfather's enthusiasm for allotments, was to follow a career in horticulture. But he drifted towards teaching, vaguely hoping he might combine the two, since gardening was then a school subject.</p> <p>As it turned out, he became a pioneer of Nuffield science in primary schools, which until then had confined their science teaching largely to what was called nature study. Nuffield put great emphasis on open-ended inquiry. So was Rose a trendy? He answers with a firm negative. </p> <p>He began his teaching career in the city of Leicester and got his first headship there - at the junior school he attended as a pupil - before he was 30. In those days, Leicestershire and Leicester were separate authorities, with the former at the cutting edge of \"progressive\" ideas and the latter resolutely old-fashioned. \"Leicestershire,\" says Rose, \"had this thing about open-plan buildings and children's choices driving the curriculum, and some of that was very difficult to swallow. It was a denial of what children are capable of.\"</p> <p>His suspicion of extreme \"progressive\" approaches was strengthened by his second headship, also in Leicester. It involved opening a new city-centre junior school to cope with an influx of east-African Asians in the early 1970s. He began with 400 children, only 17 of them from indigenous backgrounds: \"We had these youngsters coming in who had to learn English as an additional language. There was no way in which you could give them a diet which was just 'real books'.\"</p> <p>His sympathy for phonics was evident during his years in HMI, where he became head of primary inspection in 1986. \"He was ahead of most of us in recognising the role of phonics,\" said a former colleague. \"We used to joke that, if a PE lesson was to get a good rating, it should include phonics.\"</p> <p>So did he, all those years later in 2005, begin his inquiry into reading with an open mind? There is a long silence before he answers yes. He seems weary at the very mention of phonics and keeps saying \"call it phonics if you like\". He doesn't, he says, deny the importance of language comprehension, which continues to develop from the cradle to the grave. On the contrary, he strongly supports the promoting of speaking and listening skills and, in Leicester, he used dramatised stories to help Asian children. But, he continues, children need word recognition skills if language is to flourish and these need to be taught systematically. </p> <p>\"I say that synthetic phonics is the best demonstration of systematic practice. I don't really see how children can get a foothold in reading unless they understand how the alphabet works and can do the coding and decoding. Anybody who thinks they will just discover that decoding system is really way off beam. But phonics isn't the be-all and end-all. It's essential but not sufficient.\"</p> <p><strong>Phonic triumph</strong></p> <p>His report reflects this view and, in fact, emphasises that \"far more attention needs to be given, right from the start\" to speaking and listening before it even mentions phonics. All the same, the pro-phonics lobby greeted it as a triumph - with some justice, since the review concluded \"the case for systematic phonic work is overwhelming\" - and Ruth Kelly, then the education secretary, announced revision of the national curriculum to make \"synthetic phonics ... the first strategy in teaching all children to read\". Shouldn't Rose have stressed more strongly that phonics isn't the be-all and end-all? \"It's very difficult when people are so shrill not to be identified with the shrillness rather than the content. The reading wars separated out the rival factions very strongly. It was megaphone communication across a wide gap.\"</p> <p>You might say that Rose, by 2005, would have been all too familiar with megaphone communication. When Woodhead took over at Ofsted in 1992, Rose became, in effect, his right-hand man. It is hard to imagine two more contrasting characters. \"There is not an excess about Jim,\" said a former colleague. The same would not be said of Woodhead.</p> <p>Some Ofsted staff wanted a less confrontational inspection regime and looked to Rose for a lead. They didn't get it. \"We felt that Woodhead was misusing the inspection evidence,\" recalled a colleague. \"We hoped Jim would speak out, at least in a coded way. But he didn't counter Woodhead at all, even internally.\" \"He played the role of the dutiful civil servant,\" was another comment.</p> <p>I asked Rose if he tried to be a moderating influence. \"My job was to try and tell it as it is and remember the goal is to better children's education. Whatever else Chris Woodhead did, he gave the nation a wake-up call on certain issues. He may well have gone too far in terms of confrontation. That's the naature of Chris Woodhead.\"</p> <p>Did they, I ask, have rows? A long silence follows during which I wonder whether it is possible to have a row with so mild-mannered a man as Rose. \"Not rows in that sense. But I tried to get more evidence together before we took positions. You had to test findings very carefully, on the 15,000 teachers [who, Woodhead announced, were incompetent], for example. It was that kind of thing, where you really had to fight your corner to make sure what you were saying had some reliability behind it.\"</p> <p>Did he ever think of resigning? There's an even longer silence. \"No ... Not resigning, no ... No, I don't think I did ever actually think of resigning ... I probably considered whether there might be other posts...\"</p> <p>Much as the education world may then have yearned for some grand gesture, perhaps it was as well that Rose carried on. Men and women like him - conscientious, hard-working, undogmatic, entirely lacking in airs and graces, flashiness or egotism - keep the system working. As he repeatedly puts it, \"I don't make policy\". If he sometimes seems too assiduous in following his masters' commands - and legitimising what they intended to do in the first place - at least he does it in a way that calms everybody down.</p> <h2>Explained: the two reviews</h2> <p><strong>The primary review</strong></p> <p><strong>Leader: </strong>Professor Robin Alexander, fellow of Wolfson College, Cambridge.

  "<p>The financial quake of the past year has toppled almost all the world's stockmarkets. In the 12 months to the end of July, only 10 bourses stayed in positive territory, all of them in emerging markets. Half were in the Middle East, two in north Africa, plus Bangladesh, Slovakia and the Bovespa in S\u00e3o Paolo - none of them, with the exception of Bovespa, in red-hot economies.</p> <p>\"Most of these markets are somewhat obscure,\" said Nick Parsons at NAB Capital. \"I think that is a fair characterisation rather than a slur.\"</p> <p>The FTSE 100 declined by 16.5% over the past year but was still a better performer than the other main European indices. The main reason is that London is home to eight mining and commodity companies at a time when natural resources prices have been soaring. </p> <p>According to numbers crunched by Merrill Lynch, 70% of profits in the FTSE 100 this year will be made by resources companies. \"If you buy the FTSE, you are not buying the UK economy,\" said chief investment officer Gary Dugan. \"It is now very heavily weighted toward resource stocks.\"</p> <p>The stockmarkets in the big emerging markets of India and China have both fallen back as foreign investors have fled - Shanghai has dropped 35.1% over the past year. \"It is a truism that emerging markets hold up until they don't,\" said Parsons. \"They are largely about momentum and as long as they are going up they are doing well. But when they fall, they fall the furthest.\"</p> <p>The most robust of the bric economies (Brazil, Russia, India and China) has been Brazil. The Bovespa index is 5% up on a year ago, though it too has been falling pretty sharply in recent weeks, losing 20% of its value since the beginning of May.</p> <p>The strong performance of the Middle Eastern markets can chiefly be explained by high oil and gas prices, though some have also opened up further to foreign investors over the past 12 months. </p> <p>Parsons says the relative obscurity of the 10 outperforming markets has played to their advantage. \"The ones that became hot spots then collapsed. Vietnam doubled and halved. Shanghai tripled and then halved again. The stockmarkets that didn't attract large amounts of foreign investors in the past weren't subject to the same excess or capital flight.\"</p> <p>Ian Harnett, co-managing director at Absolute Strategy Research, notes that the markets that have held up are all relatively small and illiquid, which means they could be more sensitive to inflows and outflows of capital. \"Our view is that oil prices are likely to fall and they could be in for a rocky ride.\"</p> <p>The Irish exchange has dropped by 46.1% as the Celtic tiger appears to have lost its roar. At the bottom of the list though is the Iceland All Share, which has lost 52.3% of its value. </p> <p>Iceland's economy expanded rapidly on the back of high borrowing rates and is now facing potential difficulties refinancing its debts. It has been likened to the canary in the coal mine, an early warning signal for the global economy. Investors will be hoping that the comparison is unwarranted.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Ram\u00f3n Garc\u00eda Segura, 40<br></strong><br>Eighteen years ago, I was working in a laboratory, and it was in that very place that I tested myself for HIV. The result was positive. It was hard for me to accept the news, since I always wanted to create a solid home. The hardest thing to accept was my family's behaviour. They value money, and since I used to have plenty of it, they treated me well. Now they refuse to give me their support. I find their attitude painful, particularly since I never ask them for money, neither for my studies nor my medicine. </p> <p>I get by financially by helping high school and university students with their homework. </p> <p>Some time ago, in Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, the drug gang Los Zetas kidnapped one of my brothers. My family asked me to go and negotiate with them. I didn't know what to do, I was very much afraid. Finally they released him, and when I came back I learned that they all had agreed to send me, since nobody else wanted to take the risk. At any rate, they gathered that I was doomed to die soon.</p> <p>All these years of living with the virus have taught me to become more mature and to work on my feelings. Among my future plans, I want to enter the university, study chemistry and then teach. </p> <p><strong>Ilsa Aguilar, 18</strong></p> <p>I wish my family understood me better, but we became estranged when I told them I was gay and that I liked to dress as a woman. At that time, I didn't want to live any more. I didn't take care of myself, and that included not only failing to wear condoms, but also not eating properly. I lost weight until I got sick and ended up at the hospital, where they administered an HIV test. I was 16 years old. It was harder for my parents to learn that I had HIV than to discover that I was transgender. </p> <p>The first time I dressed as a woman, I felt I was another person. My gestures no longer provoked laughter. I don't care any longer about the way others react. No matter what I do, I am a person who matters.</p> <p><strong>Margarita 'Margos' Dionisi, 41</strong></p> <p>I've been married for 19 years and have been living with HIV for the past seven. Before being diagnosed I was the typical housewife who takes care of her husband and children. I'm now also a vendor. I sell candy on the street. And I also give talks to fellow HIV-positive people. HIV has taught me that life goes on and there's always a tomorrow. I give thanks for all the good and bad things that have happened to me. I pray for my family but I don't pray for my health, because I'm not going to relinquish to anyone else the power that is in my own hands.</p> <p><strong>Mart\u00edn Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, 39</strong></p> <p>When the doctor told me that we needed to discuss the results of my blood test, I already knew I was positive; Alfredo, my lover, had already been diagnosed. But his disappearance was even worse than learning I was HIV-positive. We had lived together for five years. One afternoon he called to tell me he was coming home. He never arrived. Seven years have gone by, and I still haven't heard a word from him. </p> <p>I have never suffered from living with HIV. My daily life has not changed and I'm still working. For some time I was a professional dancer, but the struggle between dancing and working forced me to abandon this activity. Each of my images depicts a footprint in time, a mark left by the environment or by society. The cars, houses and trees in my photographs keep their essence despite these marks. Their condition may not look appealing, but we cannot change it. What we can change is how we see.</p> <p><strong>Magda Padilla, 47</strong></p> <p>Over five years ago, I was diagnosed with HIV. Before then, my life was no different from that of any other housewife. I consider myself to be a strong woman, but if you are told that you have a disease and that you are dying from it at age 40, with small children, the blow is devastating. My husband is a truck driver. From the first moment, he gave me his full support. He said: \"If you are infected, so am I. We're going to get out of this together, the way we have overcome every other problem.\"</p> <p>Once the initial fears and symptoms were past, I became aware of the deficiencies in the medical services. This \"discovery\" turned me into an activist, which means something more than distributing condoms: we have to re-educate ourselves about our fundamental rights. It was at this moment that I realised all the potential I have as a woman. My life is a continuous learning experience.

  "<p>A climate change protester was arrested yesterday for breaching his bail conditions by attending the climate camp at the Kingsnorth power station in Kent.</p> <p>Paul Morrozzo, 41, was identified and arrested by police at the camp gates. Another protester who was not breaching bail but who refused to identify herself was also removed. After a long standoff four more protesters on bail were let into the camp amid cheers and chants of \"break your bail\" from the crowds.</p> <p>Before his arrest, Morrozzo said: \"It just shows the tragic level of authoritarianism when the police are cracking down on a group of people who simply want to get together to discuss the most important issue facing the world.\"</p> <p>The five protesters were part of a group of 29 activists arrested in June when they tried to stop a train outside the Drax power plant near Selby, North Yorkshire. Bail conditions included a ban on them approaching any power station and attending this year's climate camp, where up to 2,000 people are expected this week.</p> <p>There was a heavy police presence at Kingsnorth yesterday, with helicopters flying overhead and tense scenes as officers searched protesters and checked identities. Protesters inside the camp booed about 25 police officers blocking the path of new arrivals and the supply of deliveries.</p> <p>Activists are at the week-long event near Kingsnorth village to protest against the construction of a \u00a31bn coal-fired power station by the energy provider E.ON.</p>",
  "<p>As soon as I have finished this column I will jump on the train to Kent. Last year Al Gore remarked: \"I can't understand why there aren't rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal-fired power plants.\" Like hundreds of honorary young people, I am casting my Zimmer frame aside to answer the call. </p> <p>Everything now hinges on stopping coal. Whether we prevent runaway climate change largely depends on whether we keep using the most carbon-intensive fossil fuel. Unless we either leave it - or the carbon dioxide it produces - in the ground, human development will start spiralling backwards. The more coal is burnt, the smaller are our chances of future comfort and prosperity. The industrial revolution has gone into reverse. </p> <p>It is not because of polar bears that I will be joining the climate camp outside the coal plant at Kingsnorth. It is not because of butterflies or frogs or penguins or rainforests, much as I love them all. It is because everything I have fought for and that all campaigners for social justice have ever fought for - food, clean water, shelter, security - is jeopardised by climate change. Those who claim to identify a conflict between environmentalism and humanitarianism have either failed to read the science or have refused to understand it. </p> <p>Our government could lead the world in one of two directions. Roughly one third of our power stations will come to the end of their lives by 2020. It could replace them with low-carbon plants or it could repeat - this time in full knowledge of the consequences - the disastrous decisions of the past. E.ON's application to build a new coal-burning power station at Kingsnorth is the first for many years. At least five other such proposals hang on the outcome. Between them they would account for 54 million tonnes of carbon emissions a year: as much as the entire economy would produce if the UK, in line with current science, were to cut its emissions by 90%. </p> <p>The government seems determined to make the wrong decision. It has inherited the party's traditional love for coal, but, being New Labour, now supports the bosses instead of the workers, and has colluded with them to make the case for a new generation of power stations. It has one justification for this policy: that one day dirty coal will be transformed into clean coal by means of carbon capture and storage (CCS). All that is needed to effect this transformation is a sprinkling of alchemical dust, in the form of the future price of carbon. The market, it claims, will automatically ensure that coal plants bury their carbon dioxide, as this will be cheaper than buying pollution permits. </p> <p>Last month the House of Commons environmental audit committee examined this proposition and found that it was nonsense. It cited studies by the UK Energy Research Centre and Climate Change Capital which estimate that capturing carbon from existing coal plants will cost \u20ac90-155 (\u00a371-\u00a3122) per tonne of CO2. Yet the government predicts that the likely price of carbon between 2013 to 2020 will be around \u20ac39 (\u00a331) per tonne. Even E.ON believes that it won't rise above \u20ac50. \"The gap between the carbon price and the cost of CCS,\" the committee finds, \"is enormous.\" The energy minister, Malcolm Wicks, confessed to MPs: \"I hope that the strengthening of carbon markets ... will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for CCS. Will it be enough? I do not know.\" </p> <p>This is the sum of government policy: to cross its fingers and hope the market delivers. If it approves a new coal plant at Kingsnorth, it will do so on the grounds that the power station will be \"CCS-ready\". CCS-ready seems to mean nothing more than this: that there is enough space on the site for a carbon capture plant, should the developer deign one day to build it. The committee warns that this meaningless promise could be used \"as a fig leaf to give unabated coal-fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability\". </p> <p>The government has already shown us what it wants to do. In January, Gary Mohammed, a civil servant at the Department for Business, emailed E.ON to ask whether he should include CCS as a condition for approving its new coal plant. (This gives a fascinating insight into how government works: companies are asked to write their own rules.) E.ON replied that the government \"has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant\". Six minutes later Mohammed answered thus: \"Thanks. I won't include. Hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow.\"</p> <p>There is a simple means by which the government could ensure that our future electricity supplies would not commit the UK to stoking runaway climate change. It would do as California has done and set, by a certain date, a maximum level for carbon pollution per megawatt-hour of electricity production. This would have to be a low one: perhaps 80kg of CO2. Then, in line with the government's precious principles (or absence thereof), it could leave the rest to the market. I have now reached the point at which I no longer care whether or not the answer is nuclear. Let it happen - as long as its total emissions are taken into account, we know exactly how and where the waste is to be buried, how much this will cost and who will pay, and there is a legal guarantee that no civil nuclear materials will be used by the military. We can no longer afford any rigid principle but one: that the harm done to people living now and in the future must be minimised by the most effective means, whatever they might be. </p> <p>But I believe the likely response would be more interesting than this. Several recent studies have shown how, through maximising the diversity of renewable generators and by spreading them as far apart as possible, by using new techniques for balancing demand with supply and clever schemes for storing energy, between 80% and 100% of our electricity could be produced by renewables, without any loss in the reliability of power supplies. Unlike CCS, wind, wave, tidal, solar, hydro and geothermal power are proven technologies. Unlike nuclear power, they can be safely decommissioned as soon as they become redundant. </p> <p>A policy like this requires both courage and vision. So look at the current cabinet - Brown, Straw, Darling, Hutton, Blears, Kelly, Hoon - and weep. Every man and woman with backbone was purged from this government years ago, leaving those who know how to appease the interests that might threaten them. These people won't stand up to business, even when the future prospects of mankind are at stake.</p> <p>If fear is the only thing that moves them, we must present them with a greater threat than the companies planning new coal plants. We must show that this issue has become a political flashpoint; that the public revulsion towards new coal could help to eject them from office. You could do no better than joining us at Kingsnorth this week.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com\">monbiot.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Here's a rarity - a bank chairman willing to admit his industry brought troubles on itself. HSBC chairman Stephen Green's analysis yesterday was unremarkable but refreshing to hear. Complexity in financial services and the consequences of \"failed risk management\" need to be addressed, he said. \"Financial markets will not, and should not, return to the status quo ante.\" </p> <p>It ought to have been an opportunity for Green to admit HSBC itself scored a colossal own goal by paying \u00a39bn in 2003 for Household International, a US sub-prime lender that was almost the embodiment of the old order of loose lending. Household was probably the worst deal in HSBC's history, although the official line is that the purchase will come good in the end. But even HSBC's own accounts are less optimistic these days. A $527m charge for impairment of goodwill was taken yesterday.</p> <p>Still, HSBC can boast it has many more good parts than rotten ones. A tour of its Asia-Pacific operations illustrates the point. Pre-tax profits rose 96% in Australia in the first half, 92% in China, 27% in Singapore ... the list goes on. Add it up and HSBC as a whole, despite bleeding in the US, could report pre-tax profits of $10.2bn. Green, fairly, called the performance \"resilient\".</p> <p>The open question is whether HSBC's strengths in Asia and Europe can continue to compensate for the mess in the US. At the moment, there are enough reasons to be cheerful, despite cautious remarks about a slowdown in corporate activity in some sectors in Asia.</p> <p>But Green, with his comments about the future shape of the banking industry, seemed to be inviting shareholders to consider a longer horizon. There may be opportunities to \"accelerate the execution of our strategy\". Does he mean acquisitions? HSBC, naturally, won't say, but one interpretation is that Green is warming up the market for a strategic strike, which would presumably be in India, Latin America or the Far East.</p> <p>Certainly, HSBC has the resources - its capital ratios are healthy. The timing is also right, given the number of distressed sellers around the world. It comes down to target and price. If Green can get those right, the Household catastrophe may finally become yesterday's story.</p> <h2>Power switch</h2> <p>It's nice to have a scapegoat when bid talks collapse, but Invesco and M&amp;G really can't be blamed by EDF for its failure to land British Energy last week.</p> <p>Look at it from the fund managers' point of view. </p> <p>They were being asked to part with an option on a virtual monopoly on UK nuclear power generation. If you are bullish on long-term energy prices, as Invesco is - it owns 29% of Drax - you would want to be paid handsomely to be bought out of your position. One definition of bullishness is \u00a311 a share - the valuation put on British Energy by Goldman Sachs' analysts - not even close to the 765p a share waved by EDF.</p> <p>You would also be suspicious of any deal in which the UK government, with a 35% economic interest in British Energy, had advertised itself as an enthusiastic seller. You might feel that was not the most effective way to achieve full value, especially when a much-hyped auction for British Energy had mutated into negotiations with EDF alone. </p> <p>So why not create some mischief? It might encourage the government into some political horse-trading with the French government, owner of EDF. That may be exactly what develops in the autumn given that the government seems to regard French nuclear expertise as vital.</p> <p>Certainly, a revived - and higher - bid from EDF looks a more likely outcome than an all-share merger between Centrica and British Energy. Centrica is free to try its luck but there is an obvious obstacle to such a deal: the government wants cash, not an 18% stake in the company that is pushing up gas bills by 35%.<br><a href=\"mailto:nils.pratley@theguardian.com\"><br>nils.pratley@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "<p>Activity in Britain's construction sector last month dropped to its lowest level in 11 years, prompting analysts to predict the economy is about to enter recession for the first time since the early 1990s.</p> <p>The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply's (Cips) construction purchasing managers' index, which measures the industry's performance, fell for the fifth month in a row to 36.7, from 38.8 in June and 61.8 in July 2007 - the sharpest rate of decline since 1997. A reading below 50 signifies contraction. </p> <p>The housing activity sub-index was also at a record low. It fell for the eighth consecutive month, to 18.7 in July from 26.6 the previous month. </p> <p>Several analysts believe the sector is now in recession as the credit crunch takes its toll on housebuilders. </p> <p>Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at consultants Global Insight, said there is \"little doubt that the construction sector is now firmly in recession\".

  "<p>History is awash with brilliantly clever ideas that have revolutionised our lives; a quick flick through the Lakeland catalogue will show you at least two of them, and don't even get me started on the internal combustion engine.</p> <p>Anyway, last week some highly unmemorable people took their ideas into the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/dragonsden/\">Dragons' Den</a>. Most of the ideas were a bit rubbish, to be honest, but Peter Jones injected some excitement into proceedings by randomly investing more than the owner of fashion label Neurotica was asking for. I can only imagine that the pile of cash was burning a hole in his little table, or he has a weakness for womenswear.

Apart from one lucky person who won't be, I'll wager. Do join in by leaving your comments in the box below, and don't forget to click refresh for updates. </p> <p>So earlier this week on BBC2's brilliant <a href=\"http://www.mocktheweek.tv/\">Mock The Week</a>, comedian <a href=\"http://www.russell-howard.co.uk/\">Russell Howard</a> did a superb impression of a Dragons' Den contestant, announcing \"Hello Dragons! It's about time bumblebees had slippers\". Which made me laugh, and summed up the madness of DD far better than I ever could.</p> <p>Interestingly, Russell Howard and I go the same gym in Bath. OK, not interesting at all. But if it's random facts you're looking for, Duncan Bannatyne has had a hair transplant, apparently, suggesting his life is indeed a rich tapestry. Let's see if we can spot the joins.</p> <p>Tonight, on Dragons' Den (according to the BBC website):</p> <p>\"Hazel Ives is hoping the dragons will invest in her high wire adventure park; Michael Cotton has a device to prevent motorists filling up their diesel cars with petrol; and there are some gut-wrenching toys based on Roadkill animals.\"</p> <p>Hmm.</p> <p>In the meantime, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/dragonsden/thedragons/behind.shtml\">something</a> for all those Peter Jones lovers out there - 4 minutes and 37 seconds of the man himself. I still definitely would.</p> <p>Back at 9!</p> <p><strong>21:00</strong>: It's started! Five dragons, very rich and successful, blah blah etc.</p> <p>Lesley-Ann Simmonds is up first, she has a shoe-selling franchise called Shoes Galore Ltd, and wants \u00a3100k for 30% of her business. They sell shoes, bags and belts at parties, in at least four colours. Like Anne Summers, but with shoes rather than dildos.</p> <p>It's a totally orgasmic experience, she tells us, somewhat unexpectedly, considering they are shoes rather than dildos. Forget Sex in the City, she's got Shoes in the City, she tells us, hilariously.</p> <p>Peter says hello, and she goes all giggly and breathless. As you would.</p> <p>Theo does the old 'my kids' inheritance' gag, then expresses concern about the amount of stock she is holding. It doesn't make financial sense, he says. Leslie-Ann is getting less breathless.</p> <p>Duncan doesn't think she can make a profit either. James is out too. Ooh, there goes Peter. Will Deborah go for her idea? She's a woman, after all, and none of us can resist a pair of purple shoes. Nope, Debs is out too. Oh well.</p> <p>In the 'people who weren't worthy of being featured in full' snippet, a couple of guys come in with roadkill soft toys - basically squashed rabbits and hedgehogs in zippable body bags. The dragons don't think it's very funny, and does not promote animal welfare. Giant sense of humour failure, if you ask me. Is it wrong that I want one?</p> <p><strong>21:17:</strong> Next up is Ming Yun, who has some glow in the dark disposal champagne glasses called Light Emotions which, to my un-entrepreneurial eye, appear to be entirely pointless. He wants \u00a340k.</p> <p>Duncan asks Ming about his background, and doesn't like the fact that he has other business interests in China. Theo has issues with the fact that they have batteries, and will cause big disposal issues. Who knew Theo was an eco-warrior?</p> <p>Deborah gives him her withering death-stare, and tells him his product is, like, sooo five years ago. I have visions of Debs knocking back lit-up vodka shots down her local Wetherspoons.</p> <p>Peter, however, thinks it's a good idea (and clearly doesn't give a shit about the environment), and makes Ming an offer of \u00a340k for 30% of his business. Ming wanted to give away 8%. James Caan matches Peter's offer, Ming ask them to join forces for 25%, but James isn't having any of it.</p> <p>It is a big decision for Ming, but he goes for Peter Jones. Peter's really splashing the cash this series, isn't he? Deborah hasn't even got her purse out of her bag.</p> <p><strong>21:33:</strong> Some woman wanders in with a man in monkey suit, looking for money for an adventure centre in the US. Clearly she does not get it. Who let her on?</p> <p>Then a guy with a Barbeskew, which is a self-rotating skewer gadget for a barbecue. But it can't be patented, so anyone could copy it. Bye.</p> <p>Next up is Peter Hopton from Very PC, who make energy-efficient computers. He wants an outrageous \u00a3250k for 5% of his business. Which, if I'm not very much mistaken, values his business at \u00a35m. This should be a laugh.</p> <p>All I will say that if his idea is as rubbish as his beard, he's going to be back down those stars before you can say \"WEEE Directive\".</p> <p>Peter Jones knows everything there is to know about computers (he has a Saturday job at PC World), and they start having a big fight about whether his computers are actually green. None of the other Dragons know anything about computers, but they are very keen to nod frantically at Peter Jones' wisdom. Our computer friend here is about to get thoroughly roasted on a Barbeskew. All the Dragons are out, and Peter Hopton slopes off down the stairs like a beaten man. With a crap beard.</p> <p>Next up, novelty biscuits called Kooky Cookies. It is not a business, and they shouldn't give up their day jobs, they are told. Oops, they already have. Bummer.</p> <p><strong>21:47:</strong> Michael Cotton has a gadget with the catchy name of 'Misfuelling Prevention Device'. It's a device to prevent misfuelling, by all accounts, specifically sticking petrol in your diesel car. He wants \u00a3250k.</p> <p>Now I have a petrol car, but my oft-borrowed boss's car is diesel. Inside the fuel flap is a giant in-your-face sticker saying 'DIESEL', which only a giant fuckwit would fail to notice. Are further anti-fuckwittage precautions required, or am I massively underestimating the British public's ability to tell black from green when they're high as a kite on forecourt fumes?</p> <p>Apparently so, because Michael says that 150,000 people a year put diesel in their petrol car. REALLY? I declare that there is no hope for the human race. Oh, my other half tells me that it's actually 150,000 occasions rather than people, which suggests some people do it more than once. Hahaha.</p> <p>Well, he's clearly got something because they all look quite impressed. Bloody hell, Deborah Meaden has made an offer!!!! The full \u00a3250k, for 35%. Deborah NEVER makes an offer!</p> <p>James Caan has offered half the cash for 15%, but Michael has revealed that he has no authority from his directors to go above 25%. Deborah looks miffed, but falls into line with half the cash for 12.5%.</p> <p>Theo offers all the money for 25%, or will share with Deborah if Michael prefers. I am getting very confused.</p> <p>James revises his offer to 25% for all the money, but adds in some random clause to get his money back as soon as the business makes a profit, which seems faintly ridiculous.</p> <p>Personally I'd go for Theo and Debs for 12.5% each. Which he does, hurrah! That's Deborah clipping Aldi coupons for a while.</p> <p>And that's it for this week, people. Thank you for joining what was, I thought, a better show than last week. And if anyone knows where I might be able to purchase a soft toy that looks like a dead badger with its guts hanging out, I'd be delighted to hear about it.</p> <p>Carrie's here next week, I think - we're doing a foreign exchange and I'm off to BB.</p> <p>Have a good night!

  "<p>Over the weekend, Iran <a href=\"http://news.google.co.uk/news/url?sa=t&amp;ct=:ePkh8BM9EwLbwQq0w4ANYgubEFNqjgEr3LZUuJW5MIuMBGYEO1-cw6VxNfLir84KK517v9iAmgDP6RGe/3-0&amp;fp=48971bd47beba23f&amp;ei=hEaXSK2vEZmWQ5LG2YIE&amp;url=http%3A//afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iexaf6XoAElf0Nrqs2kEdlD4FN_w&amp;cid=1233523602&amp;usg=AFQjCNEw05VHENB216gI_lV1t1oXSlJWBA\">rebuffed</a> the latest effort by world powers to jumpstart negotiations over its controversial nuclear programme. At a meeting in Geneva last month, they had proposed a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/17/iran.usforeignpolicy\">\"freeze-for-freeze\"</a> under which Iran would suspend efforts to install more centrifuges, the so-called P5+1 would halt efforts to enact new international sanctions and the two sides would spend six weeks negotiating over whether to have formal negotiations over Iran's programme.<br> The P5+1 - China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States - <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/20/iran.nuclear\">gave Iran two weeks to respond</a>. That deadline tolled Saturday, when Iran's president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080803/ap_on_re_mi_ea/iran_syria\">pledged</a> that \"the Iranian nation will not give up a single iota of its nuclear rights.\"<br> So the freeze-for-freeze gambit failed. What's next for the P5+1?  Iran is clearly not in a negotiating frame of mind, at least on the nuclear issue. And why would it be? The game is rigged in its favour. Oil prices are at record levels, which furnish ample resources to ride out limited UN sanctions, and Tehran's influence over the course of events in Afghanistan and Iraq give it direct leverage over the security interests of the US and its allies. What the P5+1 - and the Bush administration in particular - need to do is change the rules of the game to magnify the pressures on Iran. There are four key moves they should make. First, the P5+1 should immediately seek a fourth sanctions resolution targeting Iran's senior leadership. Sanctioning Iran where it would hurt most - its petroleum sector - is improbable because few countries seem willing to bear the costs it would exact on the global economy. So sanctions alone are unlikely to force Iran's leaders to swallow the bitter pill of compromise on the nuclear issue. But Iran's leaders must incur some cost for their defiance, and a fourth resolution would remind them - as well as the rest of the world - that the UN security council is united behind the aim of ending Iran's enrichment programme. Second, the Bush administration should wholeheartedly embrace <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/21/barackobama.iraq\">senator Barack Obama's proposal</a> - all but endorsed last month by Iraq's Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki - for a responsible, phased redeployment of US forces from Iraq by the end of 2010. In addition to forcing Iraqi leaders to take direct responsibility for their country and relieving a terrible burden on America's military personnel and fiscal health, this proposal would eliminate a key source of leverage for Iran and could force it to use its influence in Iraq more constructively. <br> Third, the Bush administration should do whatever it can to knock Syria from Iran's orbit, including offers of incentives if necessary. This will be difficult, but well worth the effort. Syria is Iran's only real ally in the region. It is an important channel for Iran to funnel money and influence to groups like Hizbullah in Lebanon. But the partnership has left Syria increasingly isolated in the region, and there are signs that it may be ready to cut a deal with the west to break out of its isolation. It has already engaged Israel in Turkish-mediated discussions aimed at securing a comprehensive peace between the two longtime adversaries. And its president, Bashir Assad, travelled to Tehran over the weekend at the request of France to try and persuade the Iranians to be more cooperative on the nuclear issue.  Finally, the Bush administration should be open to direct bilateral talks with the Iranians on any issue. In negotiations over the nuclear programme, the Iranians have already indicated they seek a broader dialogue. Washington should grant it. In general, talking with Iran will produce better information about its intentions and vulnerabilities, yield more policy options and ultimately lead to better, more informed US policy. These discussions should be separate from P5+1 negotiations so as to not distract attention from the 800-lb gorilla - the nuclear programme - that Iran would just as soon not talk about. At the beginning this could entail establishing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/17/usa.iran\">a US interests section in Tehran</a> - which the Bush administration recently floated - and freeing up diplomats there and around the world to seek interactions with their Iranian counterparts, a practice that is currently prohibited.</p> <p>All this, of course, is a tall order for any presidency in its waning months, particularly one as set in its ways as the Bush administration. And none of these issues are likely to be resolved anyway before its term is up in January 2009. But President Bush could do a great service to both international security and his successor by getting the ball rolling now.</p>",

  "<p>Sitting in a teepee in the peaceful Kent countryside, surrounded by campaigners from across the UK mulling over the future of renewable energy and swapping vegan cake recipes, you could be forgiven for temporarily forgetting the outside world and its many woes. Perhaps, then, we must also forgive the police at the <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/environment/kingsnorthclimatecamp\">climate camp</a> in Kingsnorth this week for losing their grip on reality, as the sense of perspective which should have underpinned their policing strategy for the event flew straight out of the canvas window.<br> The police \u2013 primarily from the local <a href=\"http://www.kent.police.uk/Your%20Area/Medway/index.html\">Medway</a> force but Metropolitan officers are also in evidence \u2013 have raided the camp twice now, confiscating items that included crayons, disabled access ramps, marker pens, banners, radios for relaying fire and medical emergency information, the nuts and bolts holding toilet cubicles together and blackboard paint. They have found it necessary to use pepper spray without provocation, and several campers have been <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/green-living/police-make-arrests-at-climate-protest-camp-884656.html\">arrested</a> and bailed off the site for \"obstructing\" increasingly aggressive police officers.<br> Everyone who enters the site is being searched. Police officers are taking anything away that \"could be used for illegal activity\", with efforts being made to strip protesters of such hardcore weapons of choice as bits of carpet, biodegradable soap and toilet paper. In the absence of any serious threat, the police clearly found it necessary to justify their presence with an unprovoked attack on personal hygiene.  When I met with Medway police ahead of climate camp, I asked if officers could be given specific information about the ethos behind climate camp and guidelines on proportional responses. I had hoped that the guidelines would be based on sensible use of discretion and grounds of precedent. I am therefore horrified that police here have used pepper spray, riot gear, physical intimidation, and indulged in bizarre confiscations. It almost feels like an attempt to inflame tensions and provoke protesters into less peaceful behaviour. I was delighted to be invited to take part in climate camp this year; indeed, where better to highlight the government's failure to provide leadership on climate change and environmental degradation than Kingsnorth, the proposed location for the first coal-fired power station in Britain for 30 years. The climate camp protest is a peaceful and legitimate demonstration against a proposed facility that many view as a potent symbol of the government's misguided commitment to highly polluting and unsustainable fossil fuels. Activists from far and wide have travelled to register their disgust at government support for new coal-fired power stations and at the lack of urgent action on climate change. The owner of the land agrees with the camp's activities and the organisers are by now seasoned experts at creating autonomous political spaces in which discussion can flourish. So, as climate campers hold workshops and debate some of the key issues of our time \u2013 peak oil, economic downturn, food shortages \u2013 scores of police sweat in their riot gear on the other side of the fence. They all clutch a copy of a pocket booklet entitled Policing Protests produced by the ominously titled <a href=\"http://www.netcu.org.uk/default.jsp\">National Extremism Tactical Coordination Unit</a>, which appears designed to provide endless ways of shutting down legitimate protests. One such tactic has been to smash the windows of vehicles parked outside the camp and to try to tow away cars under the Abandoned Vehicles Act.<br> If only the police were as interested in addressing corporate crimes against the environment as they are in roughing up peaceful protesters. A new coal facility in Kingsnorth would emit up to 8m tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere each year \u2013 and potentially keep doing so for 50 years. That annual emissions figure is as much C02 as the world's 24 lowest emitting countries combined. So any government which commits to more coal-fired power stations \u2013 and Kingsnorth is only the first \u2013 then claims to be aiming for a massive reduction in carbon emissions by 2020 is living in a fantasy land.  The government should be showing real leadership in this debate, with measures to tackle rising energy costs and fuel poverty such as a windfall tax on massive energy company profits, as well as urgently initiating major investment in energy efficiency, renewables, decentralised energy and demand reduction schemes. According to its own figures, we could achieve a 30% reduction in energy use in the UK through existing efficiency technologies alone. Instead, ministers stick with their business-as-usual approach, further enabling the fossil fuel industry to profit and pollute, while paying scant regard to the average citizen or the environment. It is to be commended then, that thousands of citizens have been prepared to travel to Kingsnorth climate camp to demand a say in their country's energy policy and to take action to protect the environment for future generations. I am shocked by the violent and excessive attack on civil liberties meted out by the police here, as is my Green colleague on the London assembly and member of the Metrolitan Police Authority, Jenny Jones, who has already raised concerns with Met commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, and New Scotland Yard. We will be calling for any Met officers who have acted inappropriately to be reprimanded, fined or even sacked. It is crucial that we defend the right to peaceful protest, a right that is under threat from the government's disproportionate anti-terrorism legislation and anti-democratic amendments to its <a href=\"http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2007-08/planning.html\">planning bill</a>.</p>",
  "<p>One of the painfully obvious ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reduce oil consumption is to promote pay-as-you-drive auto insurance. The basic point is simple. As it stands now, most people will pay the same amount for their insurance whether they drive 500 miles or 50,000 miles. However, their risk of being in an accident is clearly greater the more miles they drive. If we can have insurance prices reflect the increased risk, it would both mean better insurance pricing and give people a substantial disincentive to drive.</p> <p>The impact could be quite large. The average cost of insurance per mile driven is close to eight cents. This means that if insurance were paid on a per-mile basis, for a car that gets 20 miles to a gallon, pay-as-you-drive insurance would provide the same disincentive to drive as a $1.60-a-gallon gas tax. This can easily lead to reductions in gas consumption and greenhouse gas emissions from the auto sector of 10% or more. </p> <p>The great part is that it doesn't even raise driving costs on average. It just makes a fixed cost \u2013 the annual insurance premium \u2013 into a per-mile cost. Since people will now presumably drive less and therefore have fewer accidents, they should actually end up paying less on average for insurance.</p> <p>I first wrote about this a decade ago with my then-colleague at the Economic Policy Institute, <a href=\"http://www.epi.org//Workingpapers/benefitsofm.PDF\">Jim Barrett</a> (pdf). Others had written about pay-as-you-drive even earlier, such as Patrick Butler with the National Organisation for Women, Daniel Khazzoom at San Jose State University, Todd Littman at the Victoria Transport Institute and Aaron Edlin, now at Berkeley. The reason for mentioning pay-as-you-drive insurance now is that the idea has finally reached the mainstream. Two researchers affiliated with the Brookings Institution have written a piece touting <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/articles/2008/spring_car_insurance_bordoff.aspx\">the merits of pay-as-you-drive insurance</a>. </p> <p>This is great news. It means that congressional staffers and potential White House political operatives can now take the idea seriously. Environmental groups, who are more fearful of new ideas than global warming, may also be persuaded to consider it as a policy option. Now that a pillar of intellectual establishment like Brookings has certified the respectability of pay-as-you-drive insurance, it means that it is at last a viable political option. </p> <p>It's great to see that the Brookings crew can occasionally pick up a new idea. Of course pay-as-you-drive is very safe as new ideas go, since it doesn't threaten any powerful interest groups. Insurance companies can make just as much money selling pay-as-you-drive insurance as selling their current polices. The oil companies may be unhappy, but they can no more prevent pay-as-you-drive insurance than they can stop people from driving more fuel-efficient cars.</p> <p>It would be interesting to see if the Brookings gang could ever be persuaded to examine some policy proposals that actually did ruffle some powerful feathers. For example, this group of hardcore \"free traders\" has never seriously considered freer trade in the area in which the US stands to benefit the most: healthcare.<br> If our trade policies made it <a href=\"http://www.cepr.net/index.php/publications/reports/professional-protectionists-the-gains-from-free-trade-in-highly-paid-professional-services/\">easier for foreign doctors to come to the US</a>, or US citizens to <a href=\"http://www.cepr.net/index.php/publications/reports/medicare-choice-plus-the-answer-to-the-long-term-deficit-problem/\">take advantage of high-quality, low-cost care abroad</a>, the potential gains would be enormous. Of course, since free trade in medical care would hurt the insurance industry and highly paid medical specialists, that's a lot more difficult than going after textile and autoworkers and the other losers from recent trade agreements.</p> <p>Speaking of protectionism, how about considering more efficient <a href=\"http://www.cepr.net/index.php/publications/reports/financing-drug-research-what-are-the-issues/\">alternatives to patent financing of prescription drug research</a>? Without government-imposed patent protection, we would pay less than $50bn a year for drugs that now cost us $250bn a year. If direct funding for research sounds too radical, how about just <a href=\"http://www.cepr.net/index.php/publications/reports/the-benefits-and-savings-of-publicly-funded-clinical-trials-of-prescription-drugs/\">paying for the clinical trials</a> where the worst industry abuses occur? But, this proposal would anger the pharmaceutical industry. </p> <p>In a year in which the big Wall Street banks have been driven to edge of bankruptcy or beyond, by executives who have pocketed tens of millions of dollars in compensation, one would think economists might be concerned about the obvious agency problem in the system. Perhaps they would try to rein in a sector of the economy that is clearly out of control, imposing a <a href=\"http://www.peri.umass.edu/236/hash/aef97d8d65/publication/172/\">small financial transactions tax</a> that could raise more than a trillion dollars over the next decade. This one would upset the financial industry, which happens to be a big source of money for the Brookings crew.</p> <p>No one expects a pillar of the intellectual establishment like Brookings to be a major source of cutting-edge ideas. It is encouraging that they can occasionally pick up an idea that has been developed on the fringe, like pay-as-you-drive insurance. It's too bad that the power of major industry lobbies makes this such a rare occurrence.</p>",
  "<p>The first song played by Johnny Vaughan and Denise Van Outen on their Capital Radio breakfast show was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrgg-6-gdkA\">Freedom by Wham.</a> And freedom is exactly what Van Outen has just got after p<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/aug/04/radio.gcapmedia\">arting from the London station just halfway through her 12 month contract</a>. What went wrong - and what should Capital do next?</p> <p>It is fair to say that Vaughan and Van Outen struggled to recreate the chemistry of their <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urPG8kB_gVw\">Big Breakfast days</a> on the wireless. Well, it's been six years since they shined on the Channel 4 breakfast show, and as any TV presenters will tell you - Vaughan, perhaps - working on the radio is a whole different kettle of fish to the goggle box.</p> <p>But it's yet another blow for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jun/20/ofcom.commercialradio\">radio soap</a> otherwise known as <a href=\"http://www.capitalradio.co.uk/default.asp\">Capital Radio</a>, and its endless series of relaunches and revamps. DJs, playlists, marketing campaigns and advertising initiatives may come and go, but one thing remains the same - t<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jul/24/rajars.commercialradio\">he miserable audience figures.</a></p> <p>Capital - or Capidal as some of its DJs insist on calling it - was bound to lose listeners from its 90s heyday with all the extra competition, not just from new commercial stations but rival digital media and a resurgent BBC.</p> <p>But the station's decline has still been an astonishing one. More like a freefall, in fact, with management changing almost as often as its on-air talent.</p> <p>Now the GCap Media station is owned by Global Radio -in a deal that still requires the approval of the Office of Fair Trading - and will soon have a father-and-son team in charge in the shape of Capital 95.8 managing director Paul Jackson and his old man, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jul/14/mediatop100200872\">Global Radio's acting chief executive Richard Park</a>.</p> <p>Van Outen will apparently use her spare time to concentrate on her TV projects, while a GCap Media spokesman suggested she just couldn't hack the early starts.</p> <p>\"It takes a special kind of person to consistently rise early and give the public the level of entertainment they expect each morning,\" the company said in a statement. No love lost there, then.</p> <p>But while Van Outen wows viewers on Saturday night telly, what of Vaughan and the Capital Radio breakfast show? He's been in the hotseat for more than three years now, and has had three different co-hosts in their time.</p> <p>Van Outen seemed a good a foil as any, <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/organgrinder/2008/02/listen_with_johnny_and_denise_1.html\">as I said on their first day together</a>, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/feb/22/radio.media1\">not all critics</a> were so convinced.</p> <p>It's back to the drawing board for Capital, then. As they search for new ideas, maybe they could ask <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/oct/26/rajars.radio\">Magic's Neil Fox</a>, the most popular commercial breakfast DJ in London. And the man who, four years ago, lost out to Vaughan in the race to succeed Chris Tarrant in the Capital breakfast hot seat.</p>",
  "<p>Enjoy these Beijing Olympics, and pray to the Mayan sky gods that your country wins some gold, for these may be the last. The fate of humanity, the Earth and the London Olympics is seriously in question as 2012 marks the termination of the 13th b'ak'tun cycle, and possibly the end of the world. Again. </p> <p>As you no doubt know, a b'ak'tun is a 144,000-day period of the ancient Maya long count calendar, just under 400 years. What catastrophe this termination event may incur is yet unclear. Predictions by Mayan conspiracy theorists such as <a href=\"http://www.howtosurvive2012.com/htm_night/home.htm\">Patrick Geryl</a>, range from the destruction of the Earth, possibly by a comet, the death of humankind, a reversal of the world order or simply a switch of the Earth's magnetic poles, and whatever natural disasters that ensue. </p> <p>There's one unifying, undeniably robust common factor in all end of days prophecies: none have come to pass. A sceptic might use this knowledge to treat forthcoming predictions with caution. <a href=\"http://www.religioustolerance.org/end_wrl1.htm\"> ReligiousTolerance.org</a> counts more than 80 apocalypse predictions, including 15 in 2006 alone. And so it will be in 2012. Why? Because the predictions are derived from poorly understood or misinterpreted texts. I'm a man of my word, and I'll bet anyone a crisp tenner that the world doesn't end in four years' time. </p> <p>Mayan culture a fascinating and something that we know little about. The Mayans had a sophisticated understanding of maths and astronomy. They indulged in brutal human sacrifice, and their culture had vanished with alarming speed by the 10th century, for mysterious reasons. Their cities were consumed by rainforest and only recently uncovered. It's this enigma that invites the dull-witted to make merry with the facts. Not being a Mayan scholar or a subscriber to guff, I was unaware of the impending doom associated with Mayan culture until just a couple of weeks ago. I was interviewing Chris Carter, the creator and director of the X-Files, a man who you might think would sign up to this kind of theory. Actually he's a sceptic, but he mentioned \u2013 as a joke, mind \u2013 that the predicted Mayan 2012 catastrophe could form the basis of a plot for a third X-Files movie. </p> <p>And then, with some kind of planetary alignment surely at play, exactly 12 days later to the very second (not counting the minutes or hours) a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/29/openthread?commentid=425f154c-c0d8-4d0e-9694-8c5abd7c4e5d\">post</a> on the boards of Cif cited the very same apocalypse and the conspiracy that suppresses knowledge that the end is nigh. </p> <p>\"Why is this event not talked about in the media despite the fact that something will happen?\" shrieked the swivel-eyed DickRichards. \"Evidence exists that our governments are actually secretly planning for such an event and building underground facilities.\"</p> <p>I'll tell you why. This is the worst conspiracy theory ever. This is the type of conspiracy that gives <a href=\"http://www.loosechange911.com/finalcut/\">moronic 9/11 troofers</a> a bad name. Is there a hierarchy of conspiracy theorists? Do the relentless anti-MMR brigade who routinely, regardless of what he's written, hijack Ben Goldacre's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/bengoldacre\">columns</a> look down on those who believe that the moon landings were <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aXuQ9Dg2gE\">faked</a>? If so, 2012 Mayan apocalypse theorists must be the bottom-dwellers. </p> <p>I counted over a hundred books on Amazon that refer to the Mayan prophecy. That's not a very good suppression by sinister governments, is it? </p> <p>Geomagnetic reversal is a fascinating phenomenon in Earth science. Why it occurs is not very well understood. The fluctuations of the Earth's magnetic field are heteroskedastic, meaning that there are so many seemingly random variables that they are virtually impossible to predict. However, reversals are known to have happened dozens of times through history, and never once with significant global catastrophes. Worst possible outcome? Maybe some migrating birds will get lost. </p> <p>Some of the Mayan theorists assert that the sun and Earth will \"come into alignment\" in 2012, and this will bring about monstrous change. Now, I'm no mathematician, but aren't two points always aligned? I mean, isn't there always a straight line between two objects? If the sun and the Earth are coming into alignment in 2012 what the deuce have they been doing for the past six billion years? </p> <p>It's all very well to debunk this type of nonsense using logic and evidence. However, don't write it off as harmless fun. The year 2012 will be disastrously significant, and many appalling things will transpire as a result of the Mayan prophecies. Their presence in popular culture has recently spawned three films of notable awfulness: Mel Gibson's Apocalypto, Indiana Jones and the Shattered Childhood Expectations (or whatever it was called) and the indescribably rubbish Aliens Versus Predator. </p> <p>If that lot wasn't bad enough, look at the movies scheduled for release in the next three years: Pearl Harbour director Michael Bay is currently making 2012: War for the Souls. Stealing a march on his dumb-as-bricks blockbuster competitor, Roland Emmerich, who resurrected Godzilla and gave us the diabolical 10,000 BC, will release \"2012\" in 2009, confusingly. May the gods help us. We are doomed.</p>",
  "<p>Newer British universities may disappear because of global competition forcing them to spend more, a leading ratings agency has warned.</p> <p>Credit analysis by Standard &amp; Poors warns of \"certain universities ceasing to exist\" because of increasing competition from China and India and within the UK.</p> <p>The analysis suggests that more research-intensive universities will be in a stronger position to cope but newer, more teaching-focused universities will struggle.</p> <p>Standard &amp; Poors publicly rates five UK universities \u2013 Bristol, King's College London, Lancaster, Nottingham and Sheffield \u2013 all of which have good credit ratings.</p> <p>The company also assesses the debt of and rates a further 15 universities confidentially. All are described as \"high investment grade credit quality\" and well placed to cope with the predicted demographic downturn in students and increasing competition.</p> <p>\"From a credit perspective, the UK higher education sector has made positive strides over the past few years, but faces increasing risks in the medium-to-long term,\" the report states.</p> <p>\"Although we view universities in general as benefiting from strong government support, individual universities may be allowed to fail, particularly when there is insufficient student demand,\" it warns.</p> <p>Predicted demographic decline is unlikely to affect demand for leading universities, the report concludes. \"Instead, any effect is more likely to be felt by the newer, less research-oriented universities.</p> <p>\"Such universities may well need to look abroad for their recruitment, and also diversify their offering to include more adult education and professional courses, if they are to maintain current levels of activity.\"</p> <p>According to S&amp;P, tuition fees have led to higher salaries but universities have stretched themselves by appointing research stars to do well in the research assessment exercise.</p> <p>\"There has also been more intense pressure to spend on infrastructure, which can be vital in recruiting top research staff from overseas, competing for international students, and coping with the rising expectations of home and EU students,\" it says.</p> <p>This is partly because students are more demanding since the introduction of tuition fees and want en-suite accommodation and broadband internet connection.

  "<p>The turmoil at the top of BP's Russian joint venture intensified today when James Owen, the chief financial officer at TNK-BP, resigned without warning. </p> <p>The move comes just over a week since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jul/25/bp.oil\">Robert Dudley, the TNK-BP chief executive, fled Russia pleading harrassment</a> and days after Tony Hayward, the BP chief executive, held talks to try to resolve the crisis with Mikhail Fridman, one of the four main Russian shareholders. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bp\">BP</a> refused to comment on the latest management upheaval but TNK-BP put out a formal statement which said: \"Mr Owen's [resignation] letter states that as the current shareholder issues remain unresolved he feels it is difficult for him to continue working independently, as his role demands.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, Dudley made a statement from a location in eastern Europe, which is not being disclosed. He said: \"Our company's financial standing and internal governance processes have been greatly strengthened under his management and he [Owen] will be very hard to replace.\" </p> <p>Sources close to TNK-BP said Owen's resignation, effective from the end of August, had nothing to do with reports that BP and its partners had agreed a peace deal involving a wholesale management change at the Russian unit, but speculation is rife that this is the case. </p> <p>Two of the Russian shareholders - Viktor Vekselberg and German Kahn - have senior management positions at TNK-BP. Their umbrella group, Alfa-Access-Renova (AAR), said they would step down if BP consented to withdraw its appointee and former executive, Dudley. </p> <p>It has been assumed, if not demanded by AAR, that Owen and the chief operating officer, Tim Summers, would leave at the same time and some sources said Owen was bailing out now because it had become obvious he had no long-term future with the company, which has its main oil and gas fields in Siberia. </p> <p>Dudley was unable to renew his visa and left Russia late last month, citing a campaign of harassment against himself and the company. He remains chief executive and is continuing to run the company from abroad, but Hayward admitted at BP's second quarter results conference last week that this position was not sustainable for more than a few months. </p> <p>BP has always claimed Dudley took his own decision to leave Russia and his chief executiveship at TNK-BP will be supported at all costs, but many industry experts believe it is only a matter of time before he agrees to leave TNK-BP, which provides BP with a quarter of its global oil and gas production but only a 10th of its profits. </p> <p>BP and AAR have been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jul/27/bp.oil\">fighting over control of TNK-BP</a> for the past six months amid expectations that one or both sides would eventually have to sell their stake to the Kremlin. </p> <p>The company has spent the past year fighting off claims from the tax, environmental and immigration authorities in what has been seen by some industry specialists as a rerun of the kind of problems thaat afflicted Shell until it sold part of its shareholding in Sakhalin to Russian state-owned Gazprom. </p> <p>In recent months, the Russian private shareholders have accused BP of running the joint venture for their own ends, something that the British company denies. The Russian shareholders in TNK-BP were unavailable for comment about Owen's resignation.</p>",
  "<p>For the first time in decades, US officials allowed drilling in the Arctic national wildlife refuge in Alaska this summer.</p> <p>It wasn't for oil, though.</p> <p>The drillers were targeting ice buried deep in a glacier high in the Brooks range.</p> <p>Their goal is to learn about the region's past climate and search for clues about the region's future.</p> <p>One pressing question: If the few Brooks range glaciers dry up - and it seems likely that they will if the current warming trend persists - what will happen to the coastal plain rivers they feed?</p> <p>Despite all the recent interest in climate change in the Arctic, there's little data on historical climate change in this swath of the Arctic.</p> <p>\"We're barely measuring what's happening now,\" said Matt Nolan, a glaciologist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks who led the ice core drilling project this summer.</p> <p>In other places where there's no written record, scientists can drill into trees to study their rings. But there are few trees in that part of the Brooks range.</p> <p>Scientists can also analyse sediment layers drilled from lakes, but there aren't that many lakes there either.</p> <p>One thing the region does have is a scattering of small glaciers. Ice cores drilled out of glaciers are one of the most valuable tools used by climate researchers around the world to study temperature changes over hundreds and even thousands of years, Nolan said.</p> <p>On the Greenland ice sheet, for example, scientists have used ice core samples to probe annual temperature fluctuations as long ago as 100,000 years, he said.</p> <p>To Nolan, drilling the McCall glacier - in the heart of the Arctic wilderness - seemed like a good research project.</p> <p>And time is slowly running out. Like other arctic glaciers in Alaska, the 4.3-mile-long (6.9 kilometres) McCall is losing about 3 feet of length per year. Physical evidence shows that the glacier was probably about five miles long in the 1800s. It may disappear in about 100 years, Nolan said.</p> <p>When the Brooks range glaciers are gone, scientists may lose their best tool for looking deep into the past.</p> <p>Since the late 1950s, scientists have been travelling to the remote glacier - 8,000 feet in elevation at its highest point and about 60 miles south of Kaktovik - to learn about the dynamics of the region's glacial ice and its climate. Nolan has been leading research projects on the glacier for the past six years.</p> <p>In March, ANWR refuge managers granted Nolan and his research team permission to drill into the glacier for ice cores.</p> <p>That's unusual for several reasons.</p> <p>The glacier is part of the Arctic refuge's wilderness zone. It is almost impossible to get permission to use a mechanical tool in a federally designated wilderness. And to make things more concerning, these guys were packing fuel-powered drill rigs.</p> <p>Ordinarily, that sort of work would be prohibited, said Jimmy Fox, the refuge's deputy manager, based in Fairbanks.</p> <p>But Fox said the refuge staff has discretion to allow such projects. </p> <p>One thing they consider is whether the work can be done outside the wilderness. Another factor: Can the tools be minimised?</p> <p>In this case, the only place in the refuge where it made sense to do this research was the McCall glacier, where related work has been occurring for more than 50 years. And drilling rigs were necessary - massive ice cores can't be extracted with a hand auger, he said.</p> <p>The project is also unusual because until now there haven't been many ice cores drilled out of Arctic glaciers in Alaska.</p> <p>The work was challenging, Nolan said, noting that at one point, the drill hit an aquifer in the ice, filling the drill hole with water.<br>The team was constantly worried about losing the drill to the moving glacier, he added.</p> <p>The research team has pulled a 500-foot-long ice core from the glacier. That's the longest ice core ever pulled out of the US Arctic, Nolan said.</p> <p>He said he hopes the core will provide a climatic record that goes back at least 200 years, when the Little Ice Age was cooling the northern hemisphere and Arctic glaciers were still growing.</p> <p>\"I'd like to know how much cooler it was, and whether it was wetter or drier,\" Nolan said.</p> <p>The core samples will be analysed by ice core researchers in Ohio and Belgium. Nolan said he hopes to have some findings by March.</p>",
  "<p>Protesters at Kingsnorth this morning. Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA</p> <p>Cries of protest this morning as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/04/kingsnorthclimatecamp.climatechange\">police swooped</a> on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/kingsnorthclimatecamp\">Kingsnorth Climate Camp</a> and took away - according to witnesses - potentially lethal weapons such as boardgames and <a href=\"http://www.climatecamp.org.uk/home\">biodegradable soap</a>. </p> <p>But actually, complaining about this sort of thing is pretty disingenuous: watching the way that Climate Camp has set itself up, it is increasingly clear that the tactic for the year is getting yourself arrested.</p> <p>How do you get arrested? Well, step one is announcing that you are going to commit a potentially criminal act. If you visit the <a href=\"http://www.climatecamp.org.uk/\"> Climate Camp website</a> (a very beautiful thing by the way, congratulations guys) you will read that the plans of the campers are:</p> <blockquote> <p>to stage a spectacular mass action to shut down Kingsnorth. Permanently!</p> </blockquote> <p>Now while they may be planning to use entirely legal methods to shut Kingsnorth power station down, this seems pretty unlikely: writing letters and talking to your local MP doesn't usually guarantee results quite this promptly.</p> <p>So it seems very possible that the climate campers are planning to commit obstruction of the highway and/or aggravated trespass. According to the relevant section of the Criminal Justice Act 1994,</p> <blockquote> <p> ... a person commits aggravated trespass if he trespasses on land with the intention of disrupting, or intimidating those taking part in, lawful activity taking place on that or adjacent land</p> </blockquote> <p>The campers have helpfully informed the police in advance. Just in case you weren't aware of it, the police can arrest you when they have reasonable grounds for suspecting that you are about to commit an offence ... I'm not a lawyer, but I have to say that it looks to me as if the police could, should they so wish, bang up the entire camp right now. </p> <p>But that, of course, would generate huge amounts of publicity for the climate campers. Which is exactly what they want. Already they've stated - and shown - that they are more than willing to go to prison for the cause. </p> <p>Today <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/04/kingsnorthclimatecamp.climatechange\">five activists prohibited from attending the camp are due to break their bail conditions</a> and hand themselves into the police. One of the five (who were among protestors who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jun/14/activists.carbonemissions\">stopped a coal train on the way to Drax</a> earlier this year), a father called Paul Marozzo, states that the urgency of climate change means that the public had to make sacrifices:</p> <blockquote> <p>If that involves going to prison - and I really, really do not want to go - then that is what I am prepared to do.</p> </blockquote> <p>I'm prepared to bet that if he goes down he won't be lonely: the police may be holding off with the handcuffs now but if things get tasty around Kingsnorth on Saturday (the planned day of action) they won't be able to avoid arresting some of the activists. This is step two in the how-to for this particular tactic, after all: pick a day and a site for a confrontation with the authorities then pour over the trenches on the whistle. </p> <p>The tactic was good enough, after all, for Gandhi, Martin Luther King and a whole generation of anti-war Americans. The environmental movement seems to have reached that junction now. </p> <p>I could be completely wrong and the whole week could be one long lovely picnic with police and activists sitting down together for a lovely singalong. </p> <p>Somehow, I must say, I doubt it.</p>",
  "<p>History will likely render a harsh judgment of George Bush's dogged determination to do nothing about global warming. Bush promised to regulate the carbon dioxide emissions that are heating up the atmosphere during his 2000 campaign, then quickly reneged once in office. For the next seven and half years, the White House ignored mounting evidence of the problem, while making a concerted effort to sabotage international action. Bush is now concluding his term with a grudging rhetorical shift, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/28/AR2007092800079.html\">acknowledging that human activities play a role in global climate change</a> after all and joining with the other G8 leaders in a symbolic call for a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jul/09/climatechange.g8\">50% reduction in carbon emissions by 2050</a>. But that's about it.</p> <p>The US <a href=\"http://www.ucsusa.org/global_warming/science/each-countrys-share-of-co2-emissions.html\">pumps more carbon into the atmosphere</a> than any other nation. There's not much hope of controlling global warming without America taking a leading role. Change \u2013 in some form \u2013 is coming. Both John McCain and Barack Obama have vowed to get serious about global warming, and both advocate that carbon dioxide emissions be capped and reduced via a system of tradable permits in a regime similar to Europe's. McCain started off the summer <a href=\"http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/Issues/da151a1c-733a-4dc1-9cd3-f9ca5caba1de.htm\">touting his environmental programmes</a> in a bid to distance himself from Bush. He's proposing not only the cap-and-trade plan, but also a range of programmes including a $300m prize for developing a next-generation electric car battery and a plan to \"green\" the federal government. <a href=\"http://www.barackobama.com/issues/energy\">Obama's plans</a> are even more ambitious, including $150bn over the next decade to spur development of clean energy.</p> <p>Lamentably, though, the world is probably going to have to get a lot hotter before America gets out in front on this issue. The great carbon debate is only just beginning in America, and it's not clear where it will go. The US could forge a broad consensus on carbon and use it to lead the world to action on climate change. But another, more likely outcome is what we've seen in many high-stakes political debates here: endless talk and only incremental action.</p> <p>Let's start with the fundamentals. The US rarely follows a European model for its major government programmes \u2013 just look at healthcare. Climate change is likely to be no exception. America's geographical isolation and its superpower ways don't exactly equip it well for the kind of painstaking, sustained political coordination that will be required to confront global warming. Americans are used to knocking heads together, not sending bureaucrats off to calibrate our CO2 emissions with those of other nations.</p> <p>Current American development patterns, predicated on wide-open spaces, mobility and SUVs, are obviously going to have to change. But it's going to be hard to sell people on policies designed to raise energy costs even higher, as capping carbon emissions will.<br> Finally, the American political system is constructed in ways that allow individual interest groups to hold it hostage at the expense of the national or global interest. The combined lobbying clout of oil and coal companies, along with the large industries that emit the most CO2, dwarfs that of environmental groups \u2013 or any interest group, for that matter.</p> <p>The political debate is already moving in ways that show the obstacles a carbon programme will face. Conservatives, acknowledging the problem after years of denial, are mobilising against the notion of a government big-fix. <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/\">The National Review</a>, which helps set the tone for Republican politics, has argued that though global warming is likely to be a serious problem, the <a href=\"http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MjIyZGU4ZGU2NWUyYjgzOGYzNDI1NTUxYzQzYmI4Njk=\">uncertainties and economic costs involved are simply too great</a> to embark on an ambitious carbon reduction programme. The eco-contrarians at the <a href=\"http://www.thebreakthrough.org/index.shtml\">Breakthrough Institute</a> thinktank, meanwhile, argue that international cooperation a la Kyoto has already failed, and <a href=\"http://www.democracyjournal.org/article.php?ID=6616\">the only solution is to be found in technology</a>. They want to plow billions into alternative energy and atmosphere-scrubbing technology instead.</p> <p>The public also must be won over. Cap-and-trade is probably the most effective tool at our disposal to address climate change, yet most Americans couldn't tell you what cap-and-trade means. And we can apparently count McCain among them. In June, he suggested the overall cap on CO2 emissions was somehow voluntary, not mandatory, a detail that would effectively gut the programme.<br> Since then, McCain has said little about the issue. He withdrew his support for a cap-and-trade bill that failed in the Senate last month. His campaign, eager to sooth the nerves of its business supporters, has been telegraphing the notion that <a href=\"http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NzRkNzVlYWMzNjY2OTExNDRkNmI1YmUxYjFjZGJmZjM\">he's not serious about cap-and-trade</a> at all. Billionaire publisher Steve Forbes, a McCain economics adviser, came out and <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/wonkroom/2008/07/28/forbes-no-cap-and-trade\">said the proposal would go nowhere</a> on CNN last week. McCain has also reversed his previous opposition to offshore drilling for oil and natural gas \u2013 currently banned along much of the US coast for environmental reasons. This was a straight-up pander to voters feeling the pain when they fill their SUV tanks, though any effect on petrol prices would be negligible, and not realised for decades. Obviously, though, encouraging more oil production and consumption makes no sense if your overall goal is to reduce carbon emissions, and methods for doing so will raise energy costs.<br> Obama's cap-and-trade programme, meanwhile, is more detailed, more ambitious and, if passed, more likely to work than McCain's. Obama would auction carbon permits, something that would put a real cost on emissions while raising money that could be plowed back into research and development of alternative energy sources. But a President Obama would have to use up a giant chunk of his political capital to get such a big programme through Congress, which would almost certainly both water it down and lard it up with special interest exemptions.</p>",
  "<p>Belgian-Dutch banking group Fortis today reported a 41% drop in first-half profits after taking a hit from the ongoing turmoil in credit markets.</p> <p>Net profits plunged to \u20ac1.6bn from \u20ac2.8bn in the first six months of last year as Belgium's biggest bank took a \u20ac591m hit from the credit crunch. Excluding this impact, profits were still down 21%.</p> <p>\"We should be aware that the credit crisis is not behind us yet,\" said acting chief executive Herman Verwilst. He added that strengthening the group's balance sheet was \"the top priority of senior management today\".</p> <p>But he insisted that the underlying performance of the business, including the recently acquired operations of Dutch bank ABN Amro, was \"satisfactory\" in light of the market turbulence.</p> <p>\"Most of the commercial activities were still able to grow underlying revenues,\" Verwilst said. \"But we observe that the environment is becoming more difficult on different fronts.\"</p> <p>The half-year figures were better than analysts expected, but the cautious tone of Verwilst's comments drove the shares down 3% to \u20ac9.02 on the Amsterdam stock exchange.</p> <p>Last month Fortis caved in to shareholder pressure and announced its chief executive, Jean-Paul Votron, was stepping down, due to problems related to the US sub-prime crisis. Last autumn the bank undertook Europe's second largest rights issue, of \u20ac13.4bn, to fund its \u20ac24bn acquisition of ABN Amro's retail and wealth management activities, in a takeover led by Royal Bank of Scotland. The consortium that bought ABN for \u20ac71bn, which also included Spain's Santander, has been criticised for overpaying for the Dutch bank at a time when the global credit crisis started to unfold.</p> <p>Investors were angered in June when Fortis scrapped its half-year dividend and raised a further \u20ac1.5bn of equity as part of a plan to boost its capital base by \u20ac8.3bn, despite previously denying this was necessary. And three weeks ago Fortis was forced to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jul/16/banking.bankofenglandgovernor\">deny customers were withdrawing funds as its shares plunged</a>. </p> <p>The bank is now focused on selling off non-core Fortis and ABN assets. It said this will have a \"substantial impact\" on its results in the second half.</p> <p>Verwilst said Fortis could raise an additional \u20ac4bn in capital by selling debt and assets. \"We think the bulk of the effort in the coming months is going to come from the divestment of non-core assets. We have identified the list, we have appointed investment bankers.\"</p>",
  "<p>Just six months after she was reunited with her former Big Breakfast partner Johnny Vaughan on the Capital 95.8 breakfast show, Denise Van Outen has left the station.</p> <p>Vaughan is now looking for his fourth co-presenter on the show since he succeeded Chris Tarrant in the Capital breakfast hot seat in 2004.</p> <p>It was supposed to be a dream reunion with Van Outen six years after they last presented Channel 4's Big Breakfast together. </p> <p>But her arrival failed to lift the show's ratings above its rivals \u2013 it is third in the London breakfast wars behind Magic 105.4 and Heart 106.2 - and Van Outen was reported to find the early starts clashed with her TV work.</p> <p>In a statement, the station's parent company GCap Media, which was bought by Global Radio in a \u00a3375 million deal earlier this year, said Van Outen had asked for a meeting with the new management within three days of the takeover in June. </p> <p>\"Denise asked for a meeting and made it clear to her new bosses that she wasn't able to handle the early starts as they were impacting on her personal life and her health,\" said a GCap Media spokesman.</p> <p>\"It takes a special kind of person to consistently rise early and give the public the level of entertainment they expect each morning. Denise requested the opportunity to break her contract immediately and we obliged.\"</p> <p>The spokesman added: \"Johnny was an integral part of the initial decision to bring Denise into the show. I think he was surprised to learn she couldn't cope with the early starts.\"</p> <p>Van Outen joined the show in February but the pair failed to recreate the chemistry that characterised their time together on the Big Breakfast, and she leaves six months into a 12-month contract. </p> <p>Vaughan is currently presenting the show alongside model Lisa Snowden, although she is not expected to replace Van Outen on a permanent basis.</p> <p>Van Outen was Vaughan's third co-presenter in three and a half years, after original sidekick Becky Jago and Zoe Hanson.</p> <p>Vaughan and Van Outen had an average weekly reach of 772,000 between 6am and 9am in the second quarter of this year, down 7.6% year on year and 6.9% on the previous quarter, according to the latest official Rajar listening figures.</p> <p>They were behind the number one London commercial breakfast show, Magic's Neil Fox, with 868,000 listeners in the same time period, and Heart's Jamie Theakston and Harriet Scott, with an average weekly audience of 844,000.</p> <p>Capital, previously the undisputed number one commercial station in London, slipped to fourth place for the first time in the ratings last year, behind Magic, Heart and dance station Kiss. </p> <p>The station has lost audience ever since Tarrant's high profile departure four years ago and has continued to slide despite - or perhaps because of - a string of relaunches in recent years.</p> <p>Bauer Radio's Magic has now been the number one commercial station in London for six successive quarters with an average weekly reach of more than 2 million.</p> <p>Heart 106.2, also part of the Global Radio group, is in second place with 1.77 million. Capital reclaimed the third spot from Bauer's Kiss with 1.6 million.</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p><strong>Here at In the News we like to ask hard-hitting questions.</strong> Today, though, we're going a step further and actually getting off our arses to try and find the answers. Are you sitting comfortably? Then we'll begin ... </p> <p><strong>Isn't it about time Amy Winehouse stopped bloomin' dining out on Back to Black and got some new material recorded? </strong><br>Luckily, the Mirror's 3am team leads with a story that chimes rather well for us. Clemmie and Danielle claim to have heard a leaked track from Winehouse's work-in-progress third album and the song is said to include the lines: \"I can cook, chicken soup, meatballs, a good chicken-jerk and fried\". This would lead most sane people to believe that 3am are having their legs pulled, but they insist not and offer the following quotes as evidence that these woeful lyrics might actually be the real deal. </p> <p>\"Amy's keen to eat healthily and put on weight since she came out of hospital last month.\" Um, right.</p> <p>\"The song brings her back to her happier days when she didn't have a care in the world.\" Err ... OK. </p> <p>\"The lyrical content is a little off the wall but Amy writes about what's on her mind - and she goes all out.\" Sure, point made. </p> <p>Of course, when Winehouse's forthcoming album is released and it is all about meatballs and jerk chicken, we will drop the sarcasm and, um, eat our words. </p> <p><strong>Who is the real Burial?</strong> <br>It's a question most journalists posed in long-winded features on the critically lauded dubstep artist a good four years ago, but it's one that's just begun to trouble Bizarre's Smart Gordon. \"Mercury Music Prize nominee Burial is the chart equivalent of graffiti artist Banksy,\" Smarto explains, accurately enough. \"Hardly anyone knows the true identity of the producer widely tipped for the September gong.\" Smart offers a selection of theories on Burial's true identity, such as the name William Bevan (for some reason that goes unexplained) before inviting readers to text or email their clues as to who he really is. We very much look forward to \"Bizarre - guest edited by Burial\" when the Smart man does finally rumble dubstep's greatest mystery. </p> <p><strong>Why's everyone going funky?</strong> <br>The Sugababes will \"unleash a funkier sound on fans in time for Christmas\", says the Star's Kim Dawson, and piano-pop trio Keane have \"mutated into a funk-rock powerhouse,\" according to Smart Gordon. We've no idea what they've been putting in the water at the Nokia Green Room, or wherever it is popstars hang out, but we do know we'd rather listen to Amy Winehouse sing about tagliatelle than hear Keane get their funk on.</p>",
  "<p>Labour's wilful silence over pay will need to be challenged by any serious contenders to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/04/davidmiliband.gordonbrown\">succeed Gordon Brown</a>. They will have to speak because the fruits of corporate excess, especially in banking and finance, are scattered all around. The system that was created during the boom years is evidently bust.</p> <p>Above all, they will have to say something because the Tory stance on \"broken Britain\" has \u2013 whether <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/04/conservatives.davidcameron\">David Cameron</a> intended it or not \u2013 remoralised the debate about solidarity. Even the Tories know that lecturing poor families about responsibility sounds risible unless it is accompanied by reciprocal reminders to the best off of their (fiscal) obligations.</p> <p>The facts are in plain sight. Social mobility has slowed. Boardroom pay has accelerated, way beyond what corporate performance justifies: most of what's trotted out about global competition for talent is self-serving and evidence-defying. The ratio of top to bottom pay has stretched to the point where executives and lower-level staff barely belong to the same organisation \u2013 and the bonus culture has begun to infect the public sector, too.</p> <p>The first thing for Labour candidates as for the rest of us, is to talk about it \u2026 about money, pay, fairness. Blair and Brown decreed that pay and inequality were too politically dangerous. Either they were, in Peter Mandelson's fateful phrase, \"relaxed\" about the filthy rich or they were intellectually cowed. Globalisation was unchallengeable; an analysis which might have held water in the early 1990s sprang leaks in the 21st century. </p> <p>National tax authorities are vulnerable to corporate cowboys, it's true, but rebuilding the capacity of governments to levy fair taxes on business and individuals is one of the great challenges of the era. It would help if government ministers levelled with the public about the intense lobbying they are subjected to by the CBI and suchlike. </p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/aug/04/workandcareers.executivesalaries\">Unjust Rewards</a>, we ask the government to get vocal on another score \u2013 about what it itself is doing. Social interventions, from SureStart to Aim Higher, do work. They help counter the weight of disadvantage; they add to future productivity; they are worth every penny and more of the public investment behind them. But their authors are strangely silent. They don't make the public case for the taxation on which this spending depends \u2013 not necessarily more taxation but fairer taxation, to do away with today's fiscal anomalies and the absurd situation where poorer households pay a higher proportion of their income in tax than the best off.</p>",

  "<p>Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the Soviet dissident writer and Nobel prize winner who revealed the horror of Stalin's brutal labour camps to the world, has died at the age of 89, his son said last night. Stepan Solzhenitsyn said his father had died of heart failure at his home, but declined further comment.</p> <p>The author whose books chronicled the horrors of the Soviet gulag system was lauded as a moral and spiritual leader as well as one of the greatest writers of his time. His unflinching accounts of torment and survival in the Soviet Union's slave labour camps riveted his compatriots, whose secret history he exposed.</p> <p>His writings earned him 20 years of exile and international renown, making him one of the most prominent dissidents of the Soviet era and a symbol of intellectual resistance to communist rule.</p> <p>His wife, Natalya, told Interfax that her husband, who suffered along with millions of Russians in the prison camp system, died as he had hoped to die.</p> <p>\"He wanted to die in the summer - and he died in the summer,\" she said. \"He wanted to die at home - and he died at home. In general I should say that Alexander Isaevich lived a difficult but happy life.\"</p> <p>His monumental work the Gulag Archipelago, written in secrecy in the Soviet Union and published in Paris in three volumes between 1973 and 1978, is the definitive work on Stalin's camps, where tens of millions perished.</p> <p>Last year he was awarded one of Russia's highest honours, the state prize. In announcing the award Yury Osipov, president of the Russian Academy of Sciences, called Solzhenitsyn \"the author of works without which the history of the 20th century is unthinkable\". </p> <p>His experience in the labour camps was described in his short novel One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich. His major works, including The First Circle and Cancer Ward, brought him global admiration and the 1970 Nobel prize for literature.</p> <p>Stripped of his citizenship and sent into exile in 1974 after the publication of the Gulag Archipelago the writer settled in the United States.</p> <p>But in 1989 Mikhail Gorbachev, allowed the publication of Solzhenitsyn's works as part of his perestroika reforms and restored his Soviet citizenship, enabling Solzhenitsyn to return as a hero in 1994.</p> <p>He was born on December 11 1918, in Kislovodsk, southern Russia, and grew up a loyal communist and staunch supporter of the Soviet regime. Solzhenitsyn studied physics and mathematics at Rostov University before becoming a Soviet army officer after Hitler's invasion in 1941.</p> <p>As a student he edited the Komsomol newspaper and was awarded one of only seven Stalin scholarships for outstanding social and scholastic achievement.</p> <p>It was while at university that he began to write short stories, and drafted the plan for an immense Tolstoyan novel intended to celebrate the October revolution. But his devotion to socialist principles and indiscreet hostility to Stalin's autocratic rule led to his undoing.</p> <p>Shortly before the war's end, Solzhenitsyn was arrested and sentenced to eight years in the labour camps.</p> <p>For many years he had little expectation that his writings would see the light of day but the daring One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich caused a sensation. Its revelations about Stalin's policies and the evils of the labour camps were described as \"a literary miracle\". Within weeks his name was known all over the world.</p> <p>Last night a Kremlin spokesman said: \"President Dmitry Medvedev expressed his condolences to Solzhenitsyn's family.\"</p>",

  "<p>The greenest model for government information technology would be a network of service centres supporting all the state's applications and systems, relying on large computing centres around the country. But our expert roundtable regretfully concluded that to get there would take a miracle of joining up.</p> <p>In the here and now, the greening government IT strategy was launched in July. In it, the Cabinet Office specified 18 steps departments should take to reduce their carbon footprint, on the way to the ultimate aim - a carbon neutral government estate by 2012. But this is a plan, not a command. Departments will not be compelled to take specific measures. Participants debated how it would work in practice. </p> <p>It's about culture change, the roundtable heard; that's to say a set of dispositions rather than universally applicable rules. There's no point in ordaining that everyone, everywhere turn off their computers at night. Some machines need to be left on for updates to be installed. </p> <p><strong>Behaviour change</strong></p> <p>So how do you encourage people to change their behaviour? Security guards might go round after hours switching off computers, perhaps leaving notes to shame users into getting with the green programme. One government department had conducted an after-hours audit of computers left on then encouraged competition among staff for who had the greenest floor. </p> <p>Suppliers might offer auto shutdown as a built-in option; all office machines might have counters displaying the amount of energy they are using. </p> <p>This goes too for how much they print out. Use of paper depends on the number and location of printers. One department found that printing volumes were cut by a third when offices were refurbished and printers moved out to a portable building; in this instance the printers were never moved back in. </p> <p>Another option might be a paper quota for each member of staff, which they can either use themselves or trade with colleagues, like a mini carbon trading scheme. Another idea is rationing. </p> <p>Employees would choose either a desktop or laptop; if anything more is required there would be an additional charge.<br>It shouldn't be too difficult to enforce small changes, one contributor said, such as forbidding screen savers, or ensuring everyone printed double-sided, at least on printers set up to do so. Departments could select one or two of the Cabinet Office recommendations to focus on the most appropriate to them.</p> <p>The roundtable noted that the force of prices was going its way. Energy costs and efficiency are now the biggest drivers of the green programme and will increasingly be a factor as people look to reduce spiralling energy costs. But it doesn't matter how one gets there. Sustainability needs to be embedded in all areas of work. \"Gone are the days when we were not looking at money at all or just looking at green issues\", said one participant.</p> <p>Government departments and local authorities traditionally think only in terms of the next year's budget, but they will have to start looking at whole-life costs of their IT and stop replacing IT systems every three years. A local authority may have to weigh up the benefits of, say, a new playground against buying computers, in a climate where all spending on IT is seen as a waste of money by local papers and even councillors. </p> <p>And while central government is working on shared services, it becomes more complicated in local government where you try and share systems across different authorities. It raises the question of ownership and control, also difficult across central government.</p> <p>\"If you share things you inevitably lose control. You have not got absolute control if you are running two councils off the same system.\"<br>In the wake of scare stories about lost disks, the suspicion about data sharing in this country also needs to be challenged so information can be delivered in a different, more sustainable way. We have a possessive view of our own data that's quite different from countries elsewhere, such as Scandinavia.</p> <p>The IT industry itself works on \"Moore's law\", about the accelerating pace of increases in IT capacity: what should it do to make moderate energy consumption and make products more sustainable? It's argued that \"virtualisation\" - separating physical machines from applications and software - and more remote and home working, mean people don't need to be close to servers. That means servers can be centralised into remote data centres, leading to possible savings of 65%-70% on energy.</p> <p><strong>Caution</strong></p> <p>But caution is needed on these figures. If government bodies are simply moving their energy consumption from one physical area to another, that is not in itself a saving. Who pays what and how will any savings be measured? Better accounting systems are needed.</p> <p>Different budget holders all have to buy in, too. That includes estates managers, who have control of buildings and therefore energy costs, IT departments and commercial directorates, who deal with travel. </p> <p>It requires open dialogue between chief officers in finance, technology and information, as well as with suppliers. If chief information officers were responsible for energy costs you would see changes being made, said participants. A lot of this work only means rechannelling existing resources, not having to find new ones.</p> <p>One participant had created an energy efficiency fund based on better management of buildings but was then stymied in attempts to spend the funds on anything other than capital improvements. \"It's all very well having a million pounds but not if you can't spend it.\" However, creative accounting could sometimes be used, for example in claiming that extending the life of current machines could be designated as capital improvements.</p> <p>A plea was made to suppliers to become more proactive and come up with innovative green solutions based on specific departments' needs: \"They are not coming to me and saying this is how we can help make a difference and do what we can for the planet - and that's really what we're all about.\"</p> <p><em>This roundtable was sponsored by Fujitsu Siemens</em></p>",
  "<p>Councils are not snooping for snooping's sake: they are seeking to detect illegal activity, say the Local Authorities Coordinators of Regulatory Services (Lacors). They acknowledge there may have been instances of over-zealous use of their investigatory powers by some councils, but 99% of the time, they say, these investigations lead to some form of prosecution or action. </p> <p>What's more, councils have always undertaken such investigations; the extension of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act legislation to local authorities simply made the processes more transparent. And with transparency comes publicity, often unwelcome.</p> <p>\"Councils sometimes fail to understand is why this should be such a touchy issue,\" Lacors says. It is working with the Home Office on a set of guidelines that will provide advice on these fraught areas.</p> <p>In his annual report, published in July, Sir Christopher Rose, the chief surveillance commissioner, said that local authorities use covert surveillance only as a last resort, but granted the need for a public debate. \"It is not acceptable,\" he wrote, \"to judge that because directed surveillance is being conducted from a public place, this automatically renders the activity overt or to assert that an activity is proportionate because it is the only way to further an investigation...I encourage any debate which assists in educating the public and which enables authorising officers to judge proportionality better.\"</p> <p><strong>Obstructions</strong></p> <p>Rose noted the rising number of Freedom of Information requests about surveillance, to which, he said, local authorities had responded \"inconsistently\". Councils not giving out information readily may be deemed obstructive.</p> <p>Local authorities are struggling to find a balance between enforcement and intrusion. It's a matter of efficiency rather than political philosophy, according to Chris Leslie, director of the New Local Government Network, particularly in collecting data. </p> <p>\"There are better ways to use the data we all share as a society and feel is reasonable,\" says Leslie. The NLGN recently published a pamphlet proposing the abolition of the 10-year national census. \"Never mind intrusion, what we should be asking is whether it's cost-effective continually to be asking people to resupply the same data.\"</p> <p>Public attitudes are mixed: in some areas, cameras are welcomed for their calming influence. No one has yet protested about the use of CCTV by the Environment Agency to monitor spots where rivers might flood. </p> <p>What is curious is how little local authorities seem able to convey the benefits of their actions. Indeed, many seem almost wilfully oblivious to the effect of their actions, however well-meaning, on the public and, more pertinently, how they could be interpreted by a hostile press.</p> <p><strong>Alarmist stories</strong></p> <p>The media does have a lot to answer for. As Rose notes, FOI requests about surveillance are a rich seam for journalists. They have led to alarmist stories about local councils running surveillance operations.</p> <p>There's also confusion about the purposes of data collection and investigation. The London borough of Islington sifted through rubbish from 1,000 homes to see what people were throwing away and help improve recycling. That got short shrift in the press. </p> <p>But when people understand that data is being used for the greater good - as when health statistics are collected anonymously - they tend to be far more tolerant. </p> <p>So is this yet another area where the public sector has failed to get over its message?</p>",
  "<p>Construction activity in Britain tumbled last month at a record rate, a survey showed today, adding to mounting evidence that the sector is suffering a sharp downturn as the credit crunch continues to hurt the already-weak housing market.</p> <p>The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply's construction PMI fell to 36.7 in July - the lowest reading since the survey began in 1997. Any reading below the 50-mark signals contraction instead of expansion in the sector. </p> <p>A breakdown of the index, showed that housing construction activity also plummeted to a series low of 18.7 - the eighth consecutive monthly fall.</p> <p>\"Housing was again the sick man of the industry, as levels of activity plunged to a record low,\" Roy Ayliffe of CIPS said. \"July marked an end to constructors' optimism about recovery, as spirits were knocked by the persistent and rapid decline in new business and activity.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jul/09/redrow.bovishomesgroupbusiness\">Thousands of jobs have already been slashed across the housebuilding industry</a>, as falling prices and a sharp drop in mortgage availability sent sales tumbling.</p> <p>Today's figures strengthened fears that the UK is on the brink of entering its first recession - marked by two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth - since the early 1990s. </p> <p>\"There can therefore be little doubt that the construction sector is now firmly in recession,\" said Howard Archer, an economist at Global Insight. \"The construction sector looks to be in for an extended, very difficult time.

  "<p>These extracts come from the environmental audit committee's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/04/travelandtransport.greenpolitics\">report on car tax</a>.</p> <h2>On applying the new vehicle excise duty charges to cars<br> bought since 2001</h2> <p>We agree with the exchequer secretary: the rebanding of cars bought since 2001 is not retrospective taxation. The only retrospective element in these changes is that the new rates will apply to cars that have already been bought. In itself there is nothing intrinsically unfair or unusual about this. Variable VED was first introduced in 1999 and the creation of new bands, with the single exception of Band G, has always been applied to cars already purchased.</p> <h2>On the government's plans to create more VED bands</h2> <p>We support the widening of differentials between VED bands for existing cars. It makes perfect sense to do this for existing cars, not just new cars, given that this is a way of influencing buyers of second-hand cars towards choosing models with lower emissions. This is enormously important, given that three-quarters of all cars bought each year are second-hand.</p> <h2>On the way the Treasury publicised the changes</h2> <p>The Treasury should have taken greater care to explain that the new VED bands would apply to all vehicles registered on or after March 1st 2001. If the point of green taxes is to change behaviour, they need to be properly publicised, so that people are fully aware of what they are being encouraged to do. A failure to advertise green tax details to the public, or explain them in a timely manner to parliament, breeds suspicion about their objectives, increasing the perception of them as revenue raising measures with no environmental purpose.</p> <h2>On the Treasury's decision to use the VED changes as a revenue-raising measure</h2> <p>We would further observe that if changes to VED were introduced on a revenue-neutral basis, with reductions for low emissions cars matching in value the revenue raised from increased rates for high emissions vehicles, the policy would be both more acceptable to the public and could unequivocally be communicated as green taxation.</p> <h2>On whether the Treasury should have been bolder</h2> <p>We strongly support the Treasury's use of VED as an environmental tax, and we welcome the changes announced in the Budget. However we are seriously concerned that even the projected differentials between VED bands remain too small to be effective and, in consequence, the projected carbon savings are far less than they could be.

  "<h2>Studio overview</h2> <p>Ealing dates back to the earliest days of cinema in Britain. It was Will Baker who established a studio in Ealing at the beginning of the 20th century. By 1912 the studio had grown to be possibly the largest in Europe - certainly the largest in Britain. <br> Baker began making films on a Lumiere hand-cranked camera at the <br>end of the 1890s. His first efforts were topical - the penny-pinching kind that required a minimum of post-production. At Ealing, Baker's productions became more ambitious and the studio developed large glazed stages to accommodate them. <br> <br></p> <h2>Publicity</h2> <p>Businessmen whose skills were in theatrical presentation, distribution and production swiftly succeeded the early pioneers. In the 20s there were large industrially-organised production facilities in France, Germany, Britain and America. The story of how Hollywood came to global dominance combines commercial ruthlessness, political expediency and ineffective policy-making decisions. <br> <br>Michael Balcon became head of production at Ealing in 1938. The glory-days of the studio date from 1943 through to 1959, when the studios closed. <br> <br></p> <h2>Films</h2> <p>Ealing is usually synonymous with a distinctively English species of comedy satire, whose force comes from them being simple exaggerated extensions, in the tradition of Swift, of everyday realities. The grim realities of war, austerity and reconstruction provided plenty of scope - particularly when it came to welfare provision.<br> <br>But the comedies - of which Passport to Pimlico (1949), Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949), The Lavender Hill Mob (1951), The Man in the White Suit (1951) and The Ladykillers (1955) are probably the best known - were not the only films made at Ealing. There were social-realist and police investigation films, too - all, with one or two exceptions, swiftly forgotten<br> <br></p> <h2>Posters</h2> <p>The Ealing posters were produced, from 1943, under the direction of St John Woods who reported directly to Michael Balcon. Woods had trained as an artist and graphic designer. He assembled a stable of artists and designers - a process made possible his extensive list of friends and contacts, including John Piper, Edward Bawden, Barnet Freedman, John Minton, Mervyn Peake, Edward Ardizzone. He also had an uncanny ability to match artist and theme. <br> <br>Of his recruits, James Fitton and James Boswell were the most interesting. In the 30s they helped establish The Artists' International - a group who provided a framework that encouraged artists to explore the visual projection of left-wing political values. The International used the Whitechapel gallery as a base and were active throughout east London. They played a key role, after 1937, in raising political consciousness in relation to the Spanish Civil War. <br> <br></p> <h2>Politics</h2> <p>The association between art and politics is unusual in cinema. The posters produced to advertise films remain, in the most part, anonymous arrangements of image and text. The dead-hand of the corporate lawyer usually has the final say in what is positioned where. Inevitably, the lawyers avoid all obvious reference to politics. <br> <br>So, the Ealing film posters are remarkable on two points. Firstly, and against all the odds, they are recognisable works of art by artists whose work extends beyond the usual concerns of graphic design, cinema and fine art. Secondly, they embrace and give expression to the political dimension of satire and social-realism - especially rare in cinema. <br> <br></p> <h2>Pink String and Sealing Wax (1945)</h2> <p> <br>The plot of Pink String and Sealing Wax is played out against the background of Victorian Brighton: seaside, passion and murder combine to melodramatic effect. The over-wrought emotional framework of the plot is expressed through the exaggeratedly decorative Victorian type chosen by the designer, John Piper, for the title. <br> <br></p> <h2>Typography</h2> <p>In the context of the second world war, this typographic detail would have seemed a strange and exotic thing. The typographic defaults of war were the modern sans typefaces. The ubiquitous Gill Sans, and its various ill-considered and bastard forms, had threatened to destroy the richly varied typographic environments of English townscape and High Street. Piper, along with John Betjeman and Nicolette Gray, were the pioneer historians of this material. <br> <br>Piper and Betjeman had, through their work for the Shell County Guides, <br>explored the English seaside resorts and towns. Piper has worked up a series of aquatint prints of Brighton architecture for a limited edition book by Duckworth. </p> <h2>Verdict</h2> <p>So, the poster includes a recognisable reference to Piper's other work as a printmaker. The poster was printed lithographically and gave Piper an early opportunity to experiment with the expressive potential of the process. The inclusion of a photographic element, a detail of Googie Withers in costume, also showed the creative potential of lithography by combining the hand-made and the mechanical.</p>",
  "<p>The former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev and the former Russian president Vladimir Putin today led tributes to the Nobel-prize winning author and dissident Alexander Solzhenitsyn.</p> <p>Solzhenitsyn, whose books chronicled the horrors of the Soviet gulag system, died of heart failure last night, his son, Stepan, said. He was 89.</p> <p>Gorbachev, who dismantled the last of the gulags in the 80s, described the internationally renowned writer as a \"man of unique destiny whose name will remain in Russia's history\".</p> <p>\"Solzhenitsyn's fate, as well as the fate of millions of the country's citizens, was befallen by severe trials,\" he told the Russian Interfax news agency.</p> <p>\"He was one of the first who spoke aloud about the inhuman Stalinist regime and about the people who experienced it but were not broken.\"</p> <p>Putin, now the Russian prime minister, said in a statement that Solzhenitsyn's literary achievements, as well as \"the entire thorny path of his life\" would \"remain for us an example of genuine devotion and selfless serving to the people, fatherland and the ideals of freedom, justice and humanism\".</p> <p>The Soviet KGB veteran forged a close relationship with the fiercely patriotic Solzhenitsyn, who last year accused Nato of trying to encircle Russia and strip it of its sovereignty.</p> <p>The Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, and other world leaders including the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, and the US president, George Bush, also sent their condolences.</p> <p>Solzhenitsyn's wife, Natalya, told Interfax that her husband, who suffered along with millions of Russians in the prison camp system, had died as he had hoped to die. </p> <p>\"He wanted to die in the summer, and he died in the summer,\" she said. \"He wanted to die at home, and he died at home. In general, I should say that Alexander Isaevich lived a difficult but happy life.\"</p> <p>The author's unflinching accounts of torment and survival in the Soviet Union's slave labour camps riveted his compatriots, whose secret history he exposed.</p> <p>His writings brought him international renown, making him one of the most prominent dissidents of the Soviet era and a symbol of intellectual resistance to communist rule, but also resulted in 20 years of exil.</p> <p>His monumental work The Gulag Archipelago, written in secrecy in the Soviet Union and published in Paris in three volumes between 1973 and 1978, is the definitive work on Stalin's camps, where tens of millions perished.</p> <p>Last year, Solzhenitsyn was awarded the state prize, one of Russia's highest honours. </p> <p>In announcing the award, Yury Osipov, the president of the Russian Academy of Sciences, called him \"the author of works without which the history of the 20th century is unthinkable\". </p> <p>His experience in the labour camps was described in his short novel One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich. </p> <p>His major works, including The First Circle and Cancer Ward, brought him global admiration and the 1970 Nobel prize for literature.</p> <p>Stripped of his citizenship and sent into exile in 1974 after the publication of the Gulag Archipelago, he settled in the US.</p> <p>But in 1989, Gorbachev allowed the publication of Solzhenitsyn's works as part of his perestroika reforms, restoring his Soviet citizenship and enabling him to return as a hero in 1994.</p> <p>Writers around the world paid tribute to Solzhenitsyn.</p> <p>JM Coetzee, the South African author and a fellow Nobel laureate, described him as \"a colossus of our times\" and \"a great Russian patriot\". </p> <p>\"Alexander Solzhenitsyn was ... a man of immense personal courage and, as a writer, the one indisputable heir of Tolstoy,\" he said. </p> <p>The Australian author Thomas Keneally said: \"Stalin once said: 'One death is a tragedy, a million is a statistic.' In his books, Solzhenitsyn managed to reduce the horror of the Stalinist regime to a human and palpable level.\" </p> <p>Keneally, the author of the Booker prize-winning novel Schindler's Ark, described Solzhenitsyn's works as \"of the highest order\" and \"acutely memorable\". </p> <p>\"His books came out of intense human suffering and, in my opinion, that is one of the reasons why he deserved his Nobel prize,\" he said. </p> <p>\"All Solzhenitsyn's great work was instigated by his experience of tyranny. Personal freedom, once he got it, didn't give him a lot to write about. </p> <p>\"That was, I suppose, because in his way he was a creation of the Soviet system; that was his subject matter. </p> <p>\"There is the question of what do you do in a place that is giving you shelter but is not really yours?\"</p>",
  "<p>Will today's ever-widening global financial crisis mark the end of the era of financial triumphalism? Ask a lay person to list the 10 great innovations that drive our world today and you probably won't find too many who mention the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-Scholes\">Black-Scholes formula</a> for pricing options. But for the financial community, pioneering formulas that paved the way for modern hedging strategies should get just as much credit for the passing period of rapid global growth as mobile phones, computers, and the internet. </p> <p>Until the last 12 months, finance advocates seemed to have a strong case. By helping to spread risk, high-tech finance could help economies grow faster. Macroeconomists celebrated the \"great moderation\" of the global business cycle, with recessions seeming to become milder and less frequent. And, of course, the financial community was making money hand over fist, creating scores of millionaires and even billionaires worldwide. </p> <p>Governments were cheerleaders, too. In anglophone countries, presidents and prime ministers, not to mention some leading central bankers, boasted of superior financial systems that were the envy of the world. When French and German leaders complained that the sprawling and unregulated tentacles of new finance posed huge risks to the global economy, they were derided as sore losers. Small countries such as Iceland decided to get in on the action by privatizing their banks and setting up their own financial centers. If you cannot be Silicon Valley, then why not create a mini-Wall Street? </p> <p>Now Iceland's banks, having borrowed several times the national GDP, are in desperate trouble, with debts far beyond what the small country's taxpayers can absorb. Even the conservative Swiss gave into the temptations of high-tech finance and the riches it promised. Today, the two largest Swiss banks are sinking in liabilities that exceed seven times the country's income. </p> <p>Of course, the mother of all bailouts is the absurd blank check the United States government is granting the giant home mortgage lending agencies <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/29/usa.mortgages\">Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac</a>, which hold or guarantee $5 trillion in mortgages that are looking increasingly dubious. It is ironic indeed that US treasury secretary Hank Paulson, a former head of Goldman Sachs, a firm that exemplifies financial triumphalism, is spearheading the effort to save government-sponsored behemoths that have so conspicuously outlived their usefulness. </p> <p>Advances in the field of finance have potentially had a beneficial impact in raising and smoothing global growth. But there is also a cyclical element to the flowering of finance. When home prices were soaring, the geniuses behind mortgage finance seemed infallible. Now that prices are falling, the genius strategies don't seem quite so brilliant. </p> <p>It is an old story. Back in the early 1980s, financial engineers invented \"portfolio insurance,\" a fancy active hedging strategy for controlling downside risk. They made piles of money. Unfortunately, when global stock markets crashed in October 1987, the insurance turned out to be useless, mainly because markets for hedging collapsed. </p> <p>In the late 1990s, the US hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management convinced the world that its partners were masters of the universe. For a while, it consistently made outsized profits, supposedly due to its Nobel-prize backed financial expertise. In 1998, when LTCM went bust, it became all too clear that the firm was basically making massive quantities of simple bond trades, with huge leverage and huge risk. </p> <p>For governments, the key to success in regulating financial markets lies in maintaining reasonable constraints during boom times that prevent taxpayer funds from being put excessively at risk. Unfortunately, this is difficult to do, because boom times make people who warn of risks seems like doom mongers. That is why it is so important that governments allow financial firms to fail occasionally. That is the only way to impose real discipline on shareholders, bondholders, and corporate leaders. </p> <p>Is the current gilded era of financial triumphalism over? There is talk in many countries, even the US, that the time has come to ensure that the entire financial system, including hedge funds and investment banks, become subject to much stricter regulation. </p> <p>Financial firms are screaming murder, but it is not obvious that broader and better financial regulation would be a bad thing. In my research on the history of international financial crisis with Professor Carmen Reinhart, we find that eras of heavy financial regulation tend to have significantly fewer financial crises than lightly regulated free-wheeling eras, such as those associated with the recent period of financial triumphalism. </p> <p>No one is suggesting that we go back to the \"financial repression\" of the 1950s, but the latest crisis has left little doubt that the entire system for global financial regulation is in serious need of an update. Financial innovation ought to be allowed to flourish, but not without better checks and balances. Otherwise, we will be forever trapped in a framework where taxpayers are forced to bail out banks in bad times, while wealthy shareholders reap huge profits in good times. It is time to leaven financial triumphalism with some humility and common sense. </p> <p><em>In cooperation with <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\">Project Syndicate</a>.</em></p>",
  "<p>A friend is coming to Edinburgh in the next few days and wants to see a play with me. I've been looking through the list I've lined up for myself and am in a quandary. Should I take her to the one about <a href=\"http://www.badactheatre.com\">the Holocaust</a> performed in a claustrophobic gas chamber-type basement; the one about <a href=\"http://www.charlievictorromeo.com/\">real-life airplane disasters</a>; or the one about <a href=\"http://www.lookleftlookright.com/\">people forced to live in caravans</a> by last year's floods?</p> <p>I'm looking forward to them all, but none sound like a bundle of laughs. I know it'll be harder work persuading her to go to one of those than, say, an hour of stand-up. Yet this seems to be par for the course in Edinburgh this year. It's early days yet, but my first snap-shot of this year's Fringe suggests that theatremakers are in a very serious frame of mind.</p> <p>My all-day marathon in Traverse 2 on Friday began with <a href=\"http://www.shermancymru.co.uk/news/deep-cut/\">Deep Cut</a>, a brilliant play about the death of 18-year-old Private Cheryl James in the Deep Cut barracks in 1995. It finished with Adam Rapp's <a href=\"http://www.list.co.uk/article/10268-night-terrors/\">Nocturne</a>, enjoying a post-Almeida run, on the laugh-a-minute topic of a brother's accidental killing of his kid sister. In between, there was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=611DD3JJLVo\">Architecting</a>, which offered a post-modern dissection of Deep South racism (among other things), <a href=\"http://www.list.co.uk/article/10677-finished-with-engines/\">Finished with Engines</a>, a wry look at the imperialist war machine and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2008/jul/10/theatre.reviews1\">Free Outgoing</a>, a nightmare vision of teenage sexuality falling foul of a repressive culture.</p> <p>I write this before I've seen <a href=\"http://www.theherald.co.uk/features/features/display.var.2407919.0.Making_powerful_drama_out_of_crises.php\">Fall</a>, a new Zinnie Harris play about the trauma of post-war reconciliation, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2007/jun/19/theatre\">Pornography</a>, in which Simon Stephens considers the London bombings. Whatever people say about Dominic Hill's debut Fringe programme at the Traverse, no one can accuse him of frivolity.</p> <p>But it's not just the Traverse. The first show I saw was <a href=\"http://www.dumbshow.org/currentshows.php?itemID=current\">Clockheart Boy</a> by the well-drilled young ensemble of Dumbshow. Ostensibly a colourful play for children, with a stage full of doll-like characters accompanied by a wind-up keyboard player, it turns out to be a meditation on grief. Not only has the eccentric professor been bereft of his daughter for years since her mysterious disappearance (shades of Madeleine McCann), but he loses two further characters by the play's ambivalent end. Even the scatological satire of Iain Heggie's <a href=\"http://www.edfringe.com/shows/detail.php?action=shows&amp;id=816\">Global Warming is Gay</a>, surely as glib a title as you could dream up, conceals a serious analysis of our mixed-up attitudes to protecting the environment.</p> <p>Yet, as I prepare for a day of shows about fleeing communism, suffering war and surviving in Brazil's favelas, I'm taking all this as a good sign. The Fringe has a tendency to celebrate the superficial. There's always an audience for the spectacular, be it exotic dancers, flamboyant circuses or odd-ball novelty acts. All of these have their place, but they get sickly in excess and, in comparison with the urgency of a show like Deep Cut, seem merely decadent. I reckon the Fringe is a more purposeful place when they're kept in check. Or am I getting too serious?</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/edinburgh\">Click here for all our Edinburgh festival 2008 coverage</a></strong></p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama's recent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/26/barackobama.uselections2008\"> European tour</a> hints that the Illinois senator is Europe's choice to be America's next president. But Europeans should not expect too much. While Obama would likely restore civility and politeness to transatlantic discourse, the sources of friction are more profound. The geo-political interests of Europe and America have been drawing apart, and may well continue to do so, no matter who is president.</p> <p>Halting this progressive alienation will require major changes in outlook and policy on both sides of the Atlantic. The US will have to stop defining its transatlantic interests in terms of its hegemonic mindset, and Europe will have to take fuller charge of its own region.</p> <p>To call interests \"geopolitical\" underscores the influence of geography in shaping those interests. As Charles de Gaulle and Winston Churchill once famously agreed: \"When all is said and done, Great Britain is an island, France the cape of a continent; America another world.\" Both understood that for centuries the English Channel has been a formidable geopolitical barrier to a durable sharing of interests between Britain and France. And if the Channel has been such a barrier, durable bonds across the Atlantic seem implausible.</p> <p>In other words, from this perspective, the world's two richest and most powerful economic spaces, the EU and the US, are bound to be rivals, even when they are allies.</p> <p>A shared enemy did underpin America's alliance with parts of Europe over much of the 20th century. That enemy, however, was also European \u2013 first Germany, then Russia. In effect, the shared transatlantic geopolitical interest was between the US and one part of Europe against another. </p> <p>With the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, the transatlantic alliance confronted new realities. The interests of both the EU and the US were expansively redefined. With no massive Soviet army in the middle of Germany, Europe was no longer firmly divided into western and eastern hemispheres. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitteleuropa\">Mitteleuropa</a> revived and Germany reunified. Western Europe evolved from a \"Community\" to a \"Union\", and its states became less firmly bound to American protection. </p> <p>The Soviet demise encouraged US political elites to construct a \"unipolar\" view of America's global position and interest. This trend accelerated as the current Bush administration attempted to construct unilateral global hegemony out of the \"war on terror,\" which provoked growing disquiet in \"old Europe\".</p> <p>While America's invasion of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan\">Afghanistan</a> was widely seen as justified, the Anglo-American invasion of Iraq produced an open break between the US and its two major continental allies, France and Germany, which were supported by Russia and China. A great Eurasian bloc suddenly appeared in opposition to America's hegemonic global pretensions, prefiguring a new fluidity in geopolitical relationships, if not a tectonic shift in alignments.</p> <p>The effectiveness of Franco-German resistance to American hegemony was qualified, though, by the reactions of other European states. The prime minister, Tony Blair, did his best to resurrect Churchill's special relationship, and Britain was joined by Italy and Spain, together with nearly all the states of new Europe. The Franco-German couple could no longer claim to speak for the EU as a whole. European plans for a common foreign and security policy and for closer defense cooperation seemed brutally discredited.</p> <p>Slowly, however, Europe has seemed to grow more cohesive in its opposition to American unipolar policies and pretensions. And, after his re-election in 2004, Bush grew more conciliatory. Blair's departure left Bush increasingly isolated diplomatically, with changes of government in Berlin and Paris bringing only superficial improvements. Deteriorating economic conditions at home implied stricter limits on American intervention abroad. </p> <p>It is difficult to know where this uneasy transatlantic detente of 2008 will lead. It is now clear that European and American geopolitical interests are not automatically in harmony. Europeans do not accept the Bush administration's strategic vision, and the US is unable to pursue that vision without European support.</p> <p>The reasons for Europe's defection are eminently geopolitical. To Europe's east lies Russia, to its south the Muslim world. Europe needs good relations with both in order to penetrate growing markets, tap sources for raw materials and energy, and ensure its own domestic stability, whereas many Europeans believe that US policies alienate these regions. In these circumstances, the transatlantic alliance survives less from genuinely shared interests than from inertia. </p> <p>Can anything restore the old transatlantic harmony? A forceful revival of Russian imperialism, or a war of civilisations with the Muslim world, might provide a threat so overbearing that a frightened Europe would resume its cold war dependency on America. But Europe will not be eager to embrace such a future. It may be careful not to alienate America, but it will struggle to build a collaborative relationship with its regional neighbors. </p> <p>Of course, America's definitions of its role in the world may change. America's unipolar expectations have not been ratified by events. Indeed, there is now considerable opposition to that vision in the US itself.</p> <p>Yet today too much power is agglomerated in Washington to be contained successfully within a purely national constitutional structure. Checks and balances at home require a correlative balance of power abroad.</p> <p>Constructing such a balanced state system for itself on a regional scale has been postwar Europe's great achievement.</p> <p>Implementing that system has depended heavily on a supportive America. Perhaps it is time for Europe to return the favour. Balancing, it seems, is always necessary, even among friends. And among friends balancing is also more likely to be successful. That Europe can find the will, the means, and the confidence to play that role cannot be taken for granted. What does seem clear is that a cohesive and strong Europe on good terms with its neighbours will not fit easily into a close transatlantic alliance with an America actively pursuing global hegemony.</p> <p>In association with <a href=\"www.project-syndicate.org\">Project Syndicate</a>/Europe's World, 2008</p>",
