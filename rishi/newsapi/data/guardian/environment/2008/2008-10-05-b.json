  "<p>The number of companies floating on the world's stock exchanges has shrivelled in recent months amid diminishing investor confidence, according to two surveys published today. </p> <p>The slowdown was particularly marked in London, where just five companies went public to raise funds in the three months from July to September, according to figures compiled by Ernst &amp; Young. Between them, the three raised a mere $134m (\u00a375.5m), a fraction of the $5.1bn garnered by the 18 initial public offerings in the corresponding quarter last year.</p> <p>David Wilkinson, Ernst &amp; Young's head of IPOs in the UK, said: \"Given the uncertainty in the current environment, it is not surprising that the UK figures are so low.\" Across the world, IPO activity has fallen to its lowest level since 2003, the survey found. In the third quarter of 2008, there were 159 IPOs worldwide, raising $13.1bn. These are the lowest numbers since the second quarter of 2003, when there were 130 IPOs, which raised $6.8bn. </p> <p>This year the number and value of flotations has halved since the same period last year, with the total amount of capital raised down from $185bn to $92.5bn.</p> <p>A survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers concentrating on Europe found a similar pattern, with the total value of IPOs on European markets plunging 87% from \u20ac12.6bn (\u00a39.8bn) in the third quarter of last year to \u20ac1.6bn this year. The number of IPOs dropped from 183, which raised an average of \u20ac80m, to just 69, worth an average \u20ac33m each.</p> <p>Tom Troubridge, head of the capital markets group at PWC, said: \"Market conditions are likely to remain depressed until well into next year as investors remain wary of the highly uncertain financial environment.\"</p>",
  "<p>The deep rainforests of the central Amazon and the scorching sands of the Mojave desert have long been recognised as of outstanding natural importance by the United Nations. Now, an altogether more unlikely ecosystem wants to join their ranks. Brighton and Hove, famous for its kiss-me-quick pier and hedonistic nightclub scene, is bidding to become the world's first city to be a Unesco \"biosphere reserve\".</p> <p>The city council will launch its attempt at achieving the designation later this month, when it will map out a way to join places of natural splendour as diverse as the Cape Winelands in South Africa, Mount Olympus in Greece and the icy wastes of north-east Greenland on Unesco's register.</p> <p>It believes the Sussex city's network of nature reserves on the fringes of the South Downs, rapidly growing local food production and low-carbon housing schemes could qualify it for a status which is also being sought by environmentalists in Rome, Seoul, Stockholm and Cape Town.</p> <p>\"Since 2007, over half the world's populations have lived in cities,\" said Denise Cobb, the deputy leader of the council. \"So making cities less environmentally harmful - or even beneficial - is one of our most pressing needs.\" </p> <p>She wants Brighton to \"lead the way on sustainable cities and hopefully make us the UK's first urban biosphere reserve\".</p> <p>That ambition has astonished some locals, who point to the city's heavy traffic congestion, and its residents' hefty ecological footprint is the fourth worst of 60 British cities measured by the conservation organisation WWF. Opposition politicians from the Green party have accused the Conservative administration of \"spin\" and remaining \"in the dark ages\" on the environment after its planning committee refused applications for domestic solar panels.</p> <p>\"The aspiration to become the UK's first urban biosphere city is fantastic,\" said Keith Taylor, convener of the Green party, which has 12 councillors. \"But we have a history in this city of chasing titles. I wonder whether we actually need to be called an urban biosphere city when actually what's really wanted is action.\"</p> <p>Unesco has decided to accept bids from cities for biosphere reserve status to try to \"update the image of cities as hotbeds of pollution, stress, poverty and crime\". </p> <p>\"Cities are havens of natural and cultural diversity and may hold the key to sustainable development in the 21st century,\" the Paris-based organisation said in a statement.</p> <p>Unesco's advisers said the criteria were likely to demand that ecology interweave seamlessly with urban life. There should be nature reserves but also buildings with green roofs and \"green walls\" hung with plants to encourage wildlife, clean waterways and a commitment to low-carbon housing.</p> <p>\"These places will not be pristine biospheres like the Amazon, but in many of our cities there are areas of biodiversity and it's about identifying them and making sure they are given elevated status and thoughtfully managed,\" said Matthew Frith, a member of Unesco's UK working group on urban biospheres.</p> <p>Brighton already has several nature reserves, including Stanmer Park, where there are community apple orchards, acres of allotments and an \"earthship\" - a low-carbon demonstration home with old car tyres for walls. </p> <p>One Brighton, an apartment complex under construction in the centre of the city, will have allotments on the roof and will be powered entirely by renewable energy. Other ecohome developments have sprung up, including Hog's Edge, a row of green-roofed, timber-frame houses near the Bevendean nature reserve. </p> <p>The shops in the North Laine in the city centre testify to the growing eco-culture among Brighton residents. Cuttlefish Organic Hairdressing is just along from Vegetarian Shoes, and beside the train station is the Brighton Peace and Environment Centre, offering \"education for a fairer, greener world\". Next door, Arka offers eco-friendly funerals. </p> <p>In contrast with the WWF assessment, Brighton was last year labelled the UK's most sustainable city by Forum for the Future, a charity founded by the environmentalist Jonathon Porritt. </p> <p>The calculation included quality of life and how well the city is preparing for a sustainable future as well as current carbon footprint.</p> <p>But it may not be enough.</p> <p>\"The carbon footprint of Brighton and Hove is one of the highest in the country, quite simply because it is an affluent region,\" said Bryn Thomas, who runs the Brighton Permaculture Trust, which looks after the orchards at Stanmer. \"There's higher car ownership, more international air travel, people are more likely to buy beans flown in from Kenya in Brighton and Hove than in the valleys of Wales, where carbon footprints are smaller.\"</p> <p>\"I think it's rubbish,\" said John Freeman, a 69-year-old engineer taking a walk on Brighton Pier. \"Having been to the [Cape] winelands and various other places, I don't think you can compare this old concrete jungle with that, to be honest, even with the sea and the marine life and the sewage that is discharging in here - there's no chance.\"</p> <p>\"I've been to the Amazon and it was beautiful; you can't put Brighton in the same category,\" said Myra Morgan, 62. \"This is lovely and it should be preserved, but not put on any register.\"</p>",
  "<p>Driving into Roanoke you see the 21-storey Wachovia building imposing itself on the skyline like an gigantic illusion of economic stability. It is the town's only skyscraper so the bank's name can be seen for miles in any direction. But Wachovia, the area's fourth largest employer, is effectively no more. On the day I arrived it was the subject of an emergency rescue, crippled by bad debts. </p> <p>Just across the street the head of Roanoke's regional chamber of commerce, Joyce Waugh, was wearing a badge, courtesy of a local charity, saying \"I feel good\". Even as global capitalism comes crashing down all around, you get the feeling that Waugh, like Roanoke itself, is taking it all in her stride.</p> <p>Ironically for a valley town wedged between the Blue Ridge mountains and the Appalachians, this local economy encounters few peaks or troughs. </p> <p>\"We feel it but we don't go to the extremes,\" says Waugh. \"During the savings and loans [the failures of financial associations in the 1980s and 1990s] we felt it a little.\" </p> <p>Once a railroad town, Roanoke now has no large-scale industry. The hospital, Carillion, is the biggest employer, but small businesses dominate. </p> <p>\"If this is prolonged it will be a real problem,\" says William Figaro, head of Grow Inc, who arranges capital investment for small businesses. \"But for now the problem's more psychological. They tend to be growing well enough to sustain the position they are in, but are worried about the future.\"</p> <p>For most people in this town, says Waugh, the financial crisis seems oblique. \"Freddie and Fannie Mae were everyday people's loans,\" she says, referring to the two mortgage companies effectively nationalised last month. \"But these other ... [investment firms that are collapsing] ... people don't really have a connection with that. They don't quite understand it.\"</p> <p>The local Republican Congress member, Bob Goodlatte, voted against both of last week's bail-out bills, claiming that most of the constituents who had contacted him were against it. Figaro says he accepted the bail-out but didn't back it. Waugh sounds lukewarm to Congress' response: \"It seems oxymoronic for this to be the fix. People have a hard time figuring out why the heads of organisations that are making big bucks are walking away with big bucks.\"</p> <p>While Roanoke may not plumb the depths, some residents nonetheless are struggling to stay afloat. Figaro has found he can no longer raise money through banks and is instead finding capital via individual investors, who demand higher interest rates. </p> <p>Waugh says: \"It's tough getting capital. Some of our members are having cash flow issues. Maybe they were going to get another piece of equipment and now they won't. They're putting off travel. It's off all over.\"</p> <p>But for the time being, only slightly off. At Pop's Ice Cream and Soda Bar, Anna Robertson has seen more and more people paying with credit cards for ice-cream. Waugh has noticed the restaurants are emptier than normal. </p> <p>At the small business awards ceremony on Tuesday the mood was neither one of being in denial nor desperate. Home sales this year are down 18%; house prices have fallen just 2.5%. But the number of houses on the market is also falling, meaning people are buying. \"It's much better than other places,\" says Laura Benjamin, of the Roanoke Valley realtors' association. </p> <p>Recently the local insurance agency, Shenandoah Life, had its ratings downgraded because of its exposure to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.</p> <p>As revenues fall the state of Virginia is starting to wield the axe. Tuition fees at the nearby university, Virginia Tech, have been raised by almost 11% for undergraduates. The governor is looking to cut the state budget by 5%, a plan that will include some lay-offs. At a Barack Obama campaign meeting last week the former Democratic National Committee chairman, Terry McAuliffe, advised the audience not to look at their market-based retirement accounts for a few days because it would only upset them. One person asked whether McAuliffe thought he would still get a cheque at the end of the month. </p> <p>At the bottom end of the scale the pain is clear. Over at the food distribution agency known as the Southwestern Virginia Second Harvest Food Bank they have seen a 9% increase in people in need of assistance. More than a quarter of these are in work. Meanwhile the numbers of those donating food was down 12% last month, year on year. </p> <p>\"In the past the American dream was about having a nice house and a yacht,\" says Pamela Irvine, the food bank's president. \"But nowadays it's just trying to make it. If you can pay your bills and put food on your table and feel really good about laying your head your pillow at night without worrying about your debt - that's the American dream today.\"</p> <p>For many here, even that peace of mind is a distant prospect. One in eight families in Roanoke lives below the poverty line; the town's median income is three-quarters the national average. </p> <p>Robin Barbour and Fred Crews are struggling, living in his mother's basement until her house is sold. Then it could be the street. Crews has a steel plate in one leg and a bad shoulder. Barbour says: \"They talk about the rich and the middle class ... they never talk about poverty. We're living in total poverty. We have nothing right now.\" </p> <p>\"We've got no health care, no home, no nothing,\" says Crews.</p> <p>\"It can't get no worse,\" adds Barbour. \"We've got to go up from here.\"</p> <p>Both are volunteering for Obama's campaign, a very first cause for them.</p> <p>This is the Republicans' worst nightmare - an electorate galvanised by a declining economy. \"The scary thing is there's a receptive audience to [Obama's message of change], because of the economy,\" said Josh Johnson, at a Republican volunteers' gathering last week. He's right. </p> <p>Republican claims that Obama will bring socialism, higher taxes and wealth redistribution have been little match for concerns over plummeting retirement accounts, jobs and the health care that comes with them. Even in Roanoke, where the full force of the recession has yet to be felt, as the Dow falls, Obama's stock rises. </p> <p>Additional reporting: Daniel Nasaw</p> <p>See Younge's blogs and video at g<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/series/youngeamerica\">uardian.co.uk/world/series/youngeamerica</a></p>",
  "<p>Homes and businesses were flooded yet again in England and Wales yesterday as torrential rain caused rivers and streams that were still full after the soggy summer to overflow. </p> <p>Though some areas of Britain escaped the latest deluge, notably the north-east, where those taking part in the Great North Run enjoyed clear skies, in others the driving rain left householders mopping out and caused chaos on roads. </p> <p>Parts of Scotland were shivering, with falls of snow and some areas that missed the rain enduring their first frosts of the winter over the weekend. </p> <p>By yesterday afternoon the Environment Agency had issued 23 flood warnings from Wales and the north-west of England through the Midlands to East Anglia. Another 75 flood watches were also in force. The Met Office said 90mm (3.5 inches) of rain fell in some areas in 24 hours. It published severe weather warnings running from the border of England and Wales to the Wash. </p> <p>In Wales, motorists had to be rescued from cars caught in the floods, including a woman who was stranded in floodwater near Newtown in Powys early yesterday morning. Further west the Dyfi bridge at Machynlleth was closed.</p> <p>In Carmarthenshire, south-west Wales, fire crews were called out to pump floodwater from the basement of a pub. Mid and West Wales Fire Service also dealt with calls to homes and businesses in Welshpool, Newtown, Llanfair Caereinion, Montgomery and Machynlleth.</p> <p>Kevin Hogg, of the Met Office, said: \"The worst weather so far has been across parts of north Wales which have had 90mm of rainfall in 24 hours through Saturday night and into Sunday morning. </p> <p>\"Other parts of Wales, the Midlands and the south-east will see 30-40mm.\" </p> <p>Although the weather is predicted to clear today, Hogg said the rain was likely to return during the week. A batch of heavy rain is expected to sweep in from the south-west in the early hours of tomorrow. </p> <p>Hogg added: \"It has been pretty chilly for this time of year. Parts of northern Britain did not get into double figures last week, with temperatures of 8C to 9C instead of an average of 14 to 15C.\"</p> <p>The bad weather has also been blamed for a live 100-year-old artillery shell washing ashore at Southsea, Hampshire. </p> <p>A bomb disposal unit cordoned off the beach and divers took it out to sea and carried out a controlled explosion. </p> <p>Chief diver Kevin Amaira, who coordinated the operation, said: \"With the recent heavy weather it is possible the shell had been uncovered on the beach. We get most of our calls after heavy weather.\" </p> <p>The bad weather coincided with a report suggesting that 240 miles (386km) of Scotland's trunk roads were in danger of disappearing under mud and rocks. Transport Scotland pinpointed the 67 places where the risk is judged to be the worst.</p> <h2>Areas affected</h2> <p><strong>North and mid-Wales </strong>Dyfi bridge at Machynlleth closed. River Severn in Powys - areas around Welshpool, Newtown and Caersws badly affected. </p> <p><strong>Carmarthenshire, south-west Wales </strong>Flooding at Burry Port, near Llanelli. </p> <p><strong>River Wye </strong>Flood warnings at Builth Wells, Glasbury, Hereford, and in Hay and Ross areas. </p> <p><strong>Cumbria and the north-west </strong>Flood warnings at Keswick campsite and Mersey river. </p> <p><strong>Norfolk</strong> Wendling Beck flood warning.</p>",
  "<p>Dubai, emirate of extravagance and superlatives, laid claim to an extraordinary new record yesterday with a multibillion dollar plan to build the world's tallest tower in the face of deepening global financial gloom.</p> <p>The tower, at the centre of the Nakheel port and harbour complex, is to be \"over one kilometre\" high and have more than 200 floors, beating its nearest rival, the existing Burj Dubai tower, still under construction and due to rise to a mere 818 metres.</p> <p>The latest first for this tiny Gulf state, the glitziest of the seven members of the United Arab Emirates, will incorporate traditional Islamic styles for its extensive gardens, waterfront and bridges.</p> <p>\"It sends another message to the world that Dubai has a vision like no other place on Earth,\" said Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem, chairman of Dubai World, the parent company of developer Nakheel.</p> <p>\"At more than a kilometre high this is an unbelievably groundbreaking design,\" boasted Chris O'Donnell, Nakheel's Australian CEO. \"We are pushing the boundaries of sustainable design.\"</p> <p>Abu Dhabi, the capital of the emirates, grabbed attention in Britain last month when it bought Manchester City football club. Dubai failed to do the same with Liverpool FC, but analysts say this new project is dazzling evidence of its confidence in the face of the credit crunch and worries about global recession.</p> <p>Its ruler, Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid al-Maktoum, famous for breeding and racing thoroughbred horses, and for his $18bn (\u00a310bn) fortune, was due to give it his blessing at a VIP launch last night.</p> <p>The complex will provide homes and offices for 100,000 people. If all the reinforcing bars were laid end to end they would stretch from Dubai to New York - one quarter of the way round the world.</p> <p>The tower will be so tall that it will have five different micro-climates. </p> <p>The temperature in the atmosphere at the top of the building could be as much as 10 degrees cooler than at the bottom. High-speed lifts will allow people to see the sunset twice - from the bottom and again from the top of the building.</p> <p>Pressed on the issue of height, O'Donnell said: \"We are building a tower that's going to be over one kilometre. This is a complete iconic development. It may be the tallest. Someone may build something taller.\" </p> <p>Developers in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait will doubtless take note.</p> <p><strong>Indoor ski slopes</strong></p> <p>Dubai, once a sleepy fishing and pearling port, is already home to some of the biggest and busiest shopping malls on the planet, as well as indoor ski slopes in a desert country where the temperature is regularly over 40C (104F) .</p> <p>Nakheel is famous for its signature Palm Jumeira island and is building two other offshore Palm developments that will extend Dubai's 70km coastline to 100km.</p> <p>Last month Jumeira saw the opening of the massive $1.5bn Atlantis Hotel, where guests can pay a $25,000 a night for a room and gaze at sharks in a vast aquarium in the lobby. It is to be inaugurated by Kylie Minogue next month, in spite of fears of a terrorist attack.</p> <p>The launch of the port and harbour complex was accompanied by a loud PR fanfare (the Guardian was invited to attend with other international media). But it left key questions unanswered, not least the cost of the project at a time of tightening credit, falling oil prices and stock markets and a sense that the Gulf is not immune to the effects of the world financial crisis.</p> <p>\"We all know the world is experiencing incredible market movement, \" said O'Donnell. \"This will have an impact on the Middle East, but our view is that it will be relatively small. This will be built over 10 years. I can guarantee we will have many more cycles over this period.\"</p> <p><strong>Islamic influence</strong></p> <p>Nakheel was keen to stress that the design includes Islamic elements inspired by the Alhambra in Spain, the harbour of Alexandria in Egypt, the promenade of Tangier in Morocco, and the bridges of Isfahan in Iran.</p> <p>That looks like a gesture to Arabs and Muslims uncomfortable with the influx of expatriates to this most globalised of Middle Eastern cities, where over 80% of the 1.3 million population are foreigners.</p> <p>The message that Dubai has a vision is not new, even if the circumstances are changing for the worse. </p> <p>\"We have been bombarded with the tallest, the best, the largest, for the past few years,\" sighed Prof Abdelkhaleq Abdullah of Emirates University. \"The novelty has gone. </p> <p>\"In Dubai they like to project confidence but they turn out to be right. They don't chicken out like the others do. They go for the market and the publicity stunt.</p> <p>\"Doom and gloom about Dubai has been around from day one; they say we are over-ambitious, that we are stretching our reserves, that there will be a crash. There will be a crash one day, but not yet. The leadership is amazingly confident. Still, I wish there would be a slowdown because we can't sustain this double-digit growth.\"</p> <h2>Dizzying heights</h2> <p>\u2022 The tower will be more than 1km high</p> <p>\u2022 It will have more than 200 floors and 150 lifts </p> <p>\u2022 Approximately 30,000 workers involved in construction</p> <p>\u2022 10,000 parking spaces</p> <p>\u2022 There will be another 40 towers ranging in height from 20 floors to 90 floors (250m-350m)</p> <p>\u2022 The complex will have more than 19,000 residential apartments</p> <p>\u2022 There will also be more than 3,500 hotel rooms and a super luxury 100-room hotel will be located at the top of Nakheel tower</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc\">BBC</a>'s director general, Mark Thompson, will go before the Trust next month to deliver his masterplan to save public service broadcasting. Just a few months ago, the corporation was arguing that the funding black hole facing its rivals was not nearly as bad as they claimed. Now it is proposing a solution to their woes. The shift is indicative of a year in which the BBC's position on the PSB debate has reversed. </p> <p>The way in which Thompson's pitch is communicated and received will set the tone for the debate over the future of the BBC. For Thompson, and the BBC Trust, chaired by Sir Michael Lyons, the stakes could not be higher. </p> <p>The debate is set against a context in which ITV job cuts are running into four figures as it contemplates a 20% slump in advertising and Channel 4 is slashing its headcount, programme budget and even the pilot projects designed to point the way to its future. The rest of the British media sector, from digital startups to newspaper groups, is contemplating a slump likely to deepen further into 2009. </p> <p>Against that background, the BBC would not appear to be top of the list of potential casualties of the earthquakes shaking the industry. Its licence fee funding is secure until 2013. Onscreen and on air, it is in relatively rude health. Online, the iPlayer is a triumph. Around the globe, its commercial division is forging ahead with ambitious plans to roll out global \"superbrands\" and set up production hubs from Sydney to Hollywood. </p> <p>But an increasingly wide coalition of senior political and regulatory figures believe that, if Thompson is unable to fundamentally rewire the corporation's institutional circuits and overhaul its culture, it could be storing up serious trouble. Perhaps, counter-intuitively, it could be the BBC that faces the greatest threat in three or four years' time, when the debate about the licence fee reaches a climax once again. This would especially be the case with a Tory government in power. </p> <p>Despite what has been described by the BBC as a challenging licence fee settlement early last year, its overall revenue will increase by about 5% this year, as against a 5% decline for ITV, C4 and the rest of the commercial sector, according to industry estimates. Yet, for all its relative comfort, the BBC has appeared insecure and defensive in recent months as criticism has increased. \"It is as though it can't understand just how bad things are outside its walls. Everything is seen through a BBC prism,\" said one senior broadcast rival. To its competitors, it seems ubiquitous. Everywhere they turn, it's there first. </p> <p>Trinity Mirror's chief executive, Sly Bailey, was the latest to hit out last week. She said the BBC's plans for local broadband sites were \"a threat to the development and diversity of the local media sector online and potentially to its print-based cousins\". A lot of this rhetoric can sound like crocodile tears - like commercial radio before them, regional newspapers are as much victims of their owners' incompetence and the structural challenges of the digital age. The BBC makes a convenient scapegoat to mask their own strategic failings.</p> <p>But the problem is now acute partly because the structural and technological shifts facing other public service broadcasters have so radically changed the landscape. The disconnect between the corporation and its rivals has also been reflected in the BBC's actions and the way it has presented them to the outside world. It's unlikely there would have been quite such an outcry against the aggressive expansion of BBC Worldwide had it not been trumpeted so loudly from the rooftops just as its commercial competitors were retrenching. </p> <p>BBC concern has been heightened by the prospect of a Tory government and it is already moving to head off the perceived threat. Its new director of policy and strategy, John Tate, formerly ran the Opposition Policy Unit, advising the shadow cabinet, and co-wrote the 2005 Tory manifesto with David Cameron. Earlier this year, the wagons were well and truly circled as the Trust's Lyons abandoned any pretence at independent regulation to take up his sword against those who might top-slice the BBC. One minute the Trust has argued the problem is not as bad as Channel 4 and others have claimed, the next that it can provide the solution rather than Ofcom. </p> <p>And the continued insistence on the BBC's \"unique link\" with the licence-fee payer as an argument against sharing the \"digital surplus\" or other assets could backfire too. Several studies - from Ofcom to the Guardian and, it is understood, internal research at the BBC and Channel 4 - show that link between the BBC and viewers is neither as strong nor as deep as it would have us believe. And that effect is only going to be exaggerated in a digital age, in which people feel more affinity with programmes and talent than channels and broadcasters. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the BBC's arguments have at times appeared inconsistent. An aggressive move against top-slicing belatedly replaced by an insistence that greater partnerships could be the solution smacked of expediency rather than strategy. This uncharacteristic tactical uncertainty contrasts with the surefootedness the BBC has displayed in the past, when it countered threats to its independence with armies of strategists. </p> <p>The former culture secretary Tessa Jowell once said the licence fee should act as \"venture capital for the nation\" and there are plenty of competitors who would like that taken more literally. </p> <p>The odd thing about the BBC's aggressive PR strategy is that it seems at odds with Thompson's proclaimed instinct. Intellectually, he understands that the only way to save the BBC in the long term is to turn it inside out and weave it so tightly into the nation's broadcasting, cultural and technological fabric that it can't be unpicked. In 2004, when Thompson returned from Channel 4 to a BBC laid low by the fallout from the Hutton report, he was clutching the Building Public Value manifesto, which promised a revolutionary change in the way the corporation interacted with the outside world. It promised to make \"the BBC more open and less defensive\". In an ambitious nine-point plan, it proclaimed: \"We need to change and have a more open attitude to what others think about us, of our business relationships, our buildings, our impact on the market and our partners.\" </p> <p>Yet, more than four years on, relations with the outside world are worse than ever. At the point at which the BBC didn't get the licence-fee settlement it wanted, partly due to a tactical error by Thompson, it retreated into its shell. </p> <p>Thompson suggested recently that discussions over closer cooperation are well advanced, but rivals say that if that's the case, no one has told them. At Ofcom and Channel 4, they are maintaining an open mind but are sceptical as to whether the BBC's proposals around sharing technology and studios, and cooperating on commercial initiatives, can deliver enough tangible benefits. </p> <p>Thompson's proposals will be expanded versions of ideas already aired earlier this year, including sharing studios, equipment and expertise with regional competitors; acting as an aggregation engine for public service content from other broadcasters and institutions; exploring global commercial opportunities through BBC Worldwide; developing IPTV services to be delivered via set-top boxes; and a renewed push to help commercial radio by fundamentally rethinking DAB. </p> <p>But more than all that, the BBC will have to change its attitude. As Ofcom's Philip Graf put it last week, \"what to the BBC is genuinely meant as a warm embrace can feel to the receiving party like a bear hug\". It will be up to Thompson, not always the most nuanced in his public pronouncements, to show that his revived partnership plan represents a genuine change rather than mere window dressing. If not, the consequences - for the BBC as much as its rivals - could be profound.</p>",
  "<p>Unilever, the food and consumer goods group, has thrown its weight behind moves to scrap mandatory biofuel targets and subsidies. It is backing recommendations being made today to Commonwealth finance ministers at their annual meeting in St Lucia to improve food security and prevent famine. </p> <p>Unilever is concerned that subsidies for biofuels are driving up food prices and the cost of its products. The group is a member of the Commonwealth Business Council (CBC), which is presenting the recommendations to the ministers. The CBC is chaired by Paul Skinner, chairman of the mining group Rio Tinto; other members include the Indian steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal and John Studzinski of the private equity firm Blackstone. </p> <p>If ministers adopt the recommendations, the CBC hopes that they will lobby their counterparts for curbs on biofuels at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank summits in Washington later in the week. </p> <p>Mohan Kaul, director general of the CBC, said: \"This would be the first major world signal to stop the current rush to produce energy from biofuels that has impacted on food, security and prices.\"</p> <p>It is also the first time that a major conglomerate such as Unilever has voiced its opposition.</p> <p>Most environmentalists and non-governmental organisations are already opposed to biofuels, which use oil mostly produced from food crops, which is then blended with petrol or diesel. By reducing the consumption of fossil fuels, biofuels are supposed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but many types are so inefficient that they result in higher emissions. For example, biofuels from sugar cane in Brazil have 10% of the carbon footprint of traditional fuel, while maize-based fuels in the US have at least 80% to 90%. Biofuels are also accelerating the destruction of rainforests to clear the extra arable land needed. Environmentalists estimate that deforestation is responsible for one-quarter of the world's emissions. </p> <p>The large-scale diversion of food crops into biofuel production has contributed to record food prices. According to the International Food Policy Research Institute, the forecast increase in biofuel production will result in maize prices increasing by more than two-thirds in future.</p> <p>In the UK, from April this year, petrol stations must supply more biofuels at the pumps. By 2010, 5% of all petrol and diesel must be made from biofuels. However, this summer the government announced that it was considering reducing the targets because of concerns that biofuels are doing more harm than good. </p> <p>But India, a member of the Commonwealth, announced plans last month to increase its own target, so that by 2017, a fifth of its road fuel must be produced from biofuels. The US, which is the world's largest biofuel producer, shows no sign of reviewing its policy. It is estimated to use more than a third of its domestic maize crop to produce bioethanol.</p>",
  "<p>Somehow you always sensed that it was tempting fate when the German finance minister, Peer Steinbr\u00fcck, said last month that the credit crunch was an American matter. How long would it be before the contagion that knocked the stuffing out of Wall Street and the City would claim a eurozone bank or two?</p> <p>Well, the hubristic words were barely out of Steinbr\u00fcck's mouth before we had our answer. The Belgians and the Dutch bailed out Fortis bank; the Irish made a blanket guarantee on deposits amid fears that at least one, and probably two, of their big banks were about to go belly up.</p> <p>Steinbr\u00fcck's musings on whether the US was losing its status as the world's economic hegemon were interrupted by the need to seek approval from Brussels for the ill-fated \u20ac35bn (\u00a327bn) rescue of Germany's Hypo Real Estate banking group. And by the weekend the leaders of Europe's big four - Germany, France, Italy and Britain - were calling for an emergency global summit next month. A lesson for finance ministers: try not to anger the gods. </p> <p>The week's events have challenged the smug notion that the credit crunch is a purely Anglo-Saxon affair. A glance around Europe shows this is far from the truth: from Iceland to Greece, there are signs of acute stress accentuated by the same marked slowdown as in the UK.</p> <p>France's quarterly growth rate slowed from 0.7% in the third quarter of last year to 0.4% in each of the next two quarters, then went negative by 0.3% in quarter two of this year. Christine Lagarde, finance minister, expects GDP to contract again in the third quarter. This is technically a recession: two consecutive quarters of falling output.</p> <p>Italy has performed even less well. GDP fell in both the fourth quarter of 2007 and the second quarter of this year, dragging the already anaemic annual growth rate down to zero. In France it is 1.1% and in Britain 1.4%. Germany has been the best performing of Europe's big four economies, but it too is slowing as demand for its exports is affected by the global slowdown. Germany's output fell by 0.5% in the second quarter, pulling its annual growth rate down to 1.7%.</p> <p>By comparison, annual growth in the US is 2.2%, although the strong performance in the second quarter was due to a one-off $150bn (\u00a385bn) tax cut, and the economy now appears to be slowing fast. The evidence is that there is a slowdown across the developed world and it is in countries that follow the continental European as well as the Anglo-Saxon model; in countries that had housing market bubbles as well as those that did not, and in countries that joined the euro as well as those that stayed out. Spain, for example, is in the monetary union but announced a huge 7% annual drop in industrial output last Friday and is seeing a sharp rise in unemployment. All three British purchasing managers' surveys last week - manufacturing, services and construction - warned of recession. The first meeting of Gordon Brown's economic war cabinet today will have plenty to talk about.</p> <p>The picture is mixed for Iceland, Norway and Switzerland, which are not in the European Union at all. Iceland is in a terrible state, with confidence in its banking system shot to pieces and the economy already going backwards fast. Norway, helped by the booming oil price, is growing at 3.3%, a percentage point higher than Switzerland.</p> <p>Staring through this statistical fog is not easy, but a few conclusions can be drawn. The first is that no part of the developed world will be immune. The second is that the \"real economy\" effects took time to have an impact but are now intensifying.</p> <p>In this respect, the actions - or rather inactions - of the European Central Bank are curious. Unlike the Federal Reserve or the Bank of England, the ECB decided that the rise in inflation this year caused by higher oil and food prices merited raising interest rates.</p> <p>Inflation is now falling and, judging by the comments of Jean-Claude Trichet, its president, the ECB is moving towards easing policy by early 2009. By which time there will be abundant evidence that Europe, Japan and the US are in recession, and this will have a marked impact on Britain, where 50% of exports go to the rest of Europe. Trichet is doing a fair impression of the emperor Nero; perhaps Mervyn King would run him closest among central bank governors. </p> <p>A third conclusion is that the slow-burn effect on the European banking system probably has more to do with differences in accounting procedures than the way they were run. As Steinbr\u00fcck well knows, German banks joined their British and American counterparts in the sub-prime casino and made the same dumb bets on risky derivatives. It has simply taken longer for the losses to surface.</p> <p>A fourth observation - again fairly obvious - is that the eurozone remains a hybrid. It is a monetary union but not a political union, and so countries such as Ireland have had to go it alone in bailing out struggling banks. There is a clear distinction between the US, where the government has financial clout across all 50 states, and the EU. Calling a global summit is not the same as actually doing something, and Angela Merkel has made clear that Germany will not bail out dodgy banks in other EU countries. The European Investment Bank is releasing \u00a312bn of emergency aid to small businesses, but given the EU's size and the scale of the crisis, that is chicken-feed.</p> <p>In the long term, monetary unions do not survive without political union, and so the fifth conclusion is that there are pressures both for closer integration and for disintegration. The crisis could strengthen those who argue that the halfway house is inherently unstable and will remain so until there is fiscal as well as monetary union. On the other hand, the growing threat of recession may make some countries question the value of remaining in a monetary union.</p> <p>The London School of Economics' Charles Goodhart noted last week that the past few years have seen extreme movements in competitiveness, unit labour costs and trade balances across the eurozone. Given the ECB's concerns about inflation, these can only be rectified by the countries running large current account deficits, such as Spain, or suffering from an acute lack of competitiveness, such as Italy, growing more slowly and squeezing living standards. Clearly, this will not be wildly popular: Goodhart concludes that some members of the monetary union would vote against entry if deciding now.</p> <p>Deciding not to join is quite different from deciding to leave, and there would be considerable repercussions for a country that reinstated its own national currency in place of the euro. Goodhart puts the risk that monetary union will break up at 10-20%, which is small but certainly not insignificant.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>People who take an interest in newspapers say it's really fortunate for the industry that, with a global financial crisis raging, so many editors used to be City journalists. What they mean is they've noticed that Will Lewis is editing the Telegraph and James Harding the Times.</p> <p>I'm not sure you need to be able to recite the FTSE 100 to know that the collapse of capitalism is worth a splash. While Rebekah Wade has no previous as banking correspondent, the Sun has covered the story perfectly well. But the promotion of business editors is an interesting phenomenon. We'll get on to whether their business background has affected the way Lewis and Harding have handled the banking meltdown shortly. First, let's discuss why they are there.</p> <p>City reporters are unusual. They tend to be numerate, an unusual skill among journalists. I once watched Charles Moore, then editor of the Sunday Telegraph, test the financial ability of his staff by asking everyone at conference to estimate the level of public spending. None of us said \u00a3179bn, which is what it was at the time. One of the newsroom suggested the figure was probably as high as \u00a3500m.</p> <p>Behind their tough exteriors, City reporters have real feelings. It's not that many of their colleagues don't understand their pages, it's that they don't even read them. The Neil Collins column on the back of the Daily Telegraph was morning reading for every chief executive in business, but the poor man used to come to conference only to hear other departments suggest stories he had written about that very day.</p> <p>Conventional wisdom suggests City journalists aren't interested in stories in the world beyond finance. Conventional wisdom is wrong; it depends on the individual. Andreas Whittam Smith founded the Independent on the back of a career in financial journalism. You wouldn't accuse him of having narrow interests. David Yelland, spotted as business editor of the Sun and the New York Post by Rupert Murdoch, knew what popular news was when Murdoch made him editor of the Sun.</p> <p>Murdoch, as ever, is relevant here. Since appointing Yelland, he has gone twice more to the business pages to find Times editors, taking Robert Thomson from the Financial Times and, having dispatched Thomson to run the Wall Street Journal, lifting up Harding. The Barclay brothers have looked to business journalism too, hiring Lewis, then business editor of the Sunday Times, to run the Daily Telegraph, and Patience Wheatcroft, running the Times business pages, to edit the Sunday Telegraph. </p> <p>Understandably, this love affair with business journalists has appalled all those generalists, foreign experts and political specialists who fancied their chances of getting to the top. Why do proprietors fall for City staff?</p> <p>Well, modern proprietors tend not to like meeting staff. If they must, it's nicer being with those who talk their language, know their friends and show proper respect for money. That makes City editors good company. They get ample \"face time\" and can use it to impress their bosses with their business acumen. These are men and women who understand business, who know why the proprietor wants to make a profit, who are up for more economical ways of running a paper. When you've talked to prospective editors who bang on about journalistic standards and demand large budgets, what a relief it must be to find one who understands it's all about running a business.</p> <p>But this is not to say that business journalists are all the same. Harding and Lewis are friends, but operate differently. Close observers of the pair say they show as editors the traits they exhibited as reporters - Harding is interested in the big themes, Lewis in stories. The Times editor has been taking his paper upmarket. Like Thomson before him, he is interested in the geopolitical, so the financial crisis is the kind of territory he likes. He's been writing his own elegant leaders - some staff have been moaning that they read like his columns, only without the byline.</p> <p>Over at the Telegraph, Lewis cuts a less cerebral, more excitable figure. If Harding is attempting to restore a certain authority around the Times as a newspaper, Lewis is going for a broader target, the Telegraph as a multimedia news brand. As far as business coverage is concerned, he and his even more experienced editor-at-large Jeff Randall favour a noisy approach that can feel like sports reporting. For all its broadsheet clothing, those of us who worked there always recognised that the Telegraph was brasher than it let on - these days it has ratcheted up the brashness. </p> <p>I'm clearly getting old, for I think the Telegraph's best piece on the crisis so far came from Charles Moore, a counter-intuitive column taking to task the archbishops of Canterbury and York for criticising short-sellers. Don't be surprised. Moore talks to smart people and comes back with stories. He was the one who brought in the revelation that Barings Bank was collapsing, back in the days when banks didn't.</p> <p>We know the financial crisis is serious, but I wonder whether some Times and Telegraph readers - largely people who have paid off their mortgages and benefit from final-salary pension schemes - wonder if the world is really ending. </p> <p>We can't leave without mentioning the man who now acts as the nation's financial guide. Robert Peston had a sticky start at the BBC. He was, it seemed, a man with the perfect voice for print and every TV and radio presenter developed an impression of him for social use. Randall, his predecessor at the BBC, had created an effective role as the man who explained business to ordinary people. Peston seemed unnecessarily cerebral by comparison. Happily, he has triumphantly fulfilled the traditional role of newspaper journalists going into broadcast, which is getting stories. Those complacent telly faces aren't laughing now.</p>",
  "<p>On September 22, 1955, the eagerly anticipated new independent television service, the ITA, went on air for the first time. It reached only a tiny proportion of homes and its schedule included speeches from the Guildhall, a variety show called, appropriately, Variety, a bit of drama and boxing from Shoreditch. Despite the limited reach and apparent mundanity of this new channel, the BBC reacted, one might say somewhat hysterically, by burning Grace Archer alive.</p> <p>This was the first inkling of the competitive spirit that is now tattooed into the BBC's DNA; and it is an approach that has served the UK public remarkably well. It has inspired innovation and change within TV and radio and online worlds. But the sense that to compete and win has become the BBC's sustaining principle is the main reason for the unease among its media opponents.</p> <p>At the Association of Online Publishers conference in London last week, a BBC exec turned to me and said: \"The Guardian of course is very anti-BBC, now that you are competing with us.\" </p> <p>It's an attitude that I come across rather frequently as the Guardian's director of digital content. But, despite our rather good audio and video services, \"we\" are not competing with \"them\". The BBC is competing with us, with everybody and anyone in the converged business of media. And we compete with each other. The language in this is important, as the fortress Wood Lane mentality is still present in too many of the Beeb's defensive external messages. It should ruthlessly tutor its executives to offer a positive and open face to audiences, competitors and regulators. </p> <p>Adopting a defensive position is attractive when, as was the case during the 80s, the government is grimly determined to clip your wings and commercial revenue growth outstripped the licence fee. But to continue to do so when in receipt of \u00a33bn of public money, with a 3% yearly increase guaranteed for the next six years, is charmless, to say the least.</p> <p>The BBC director general, Mark Thompson, will quite rightly talk about the BBC being the only UK media brand that can compete internationally with other brands such as Disney and Google. But winning an international brand competition isn't written into the BBC's core purpose objectives. The pressure for the BBC to compete is regulatory, and originally prescribed for the vigorous health of a mixed broadcasting ecology. In the broadband world this means that many of us find a metaphorical Grace Archer combusting opposite our own businesses ever more frequently.</p> <p>But with the established commercial media teetering on the brink of partial economic obsolescence, we are in danger of pushing too hard to have the BBC curtailed. The fact is that, as we go into a world where the redrawing of media boundaries is so brutal and swift, the democratic objective of having a plurality of voices is almost impossible to ensure and safeguard. </p> <p>We need a strong BBC because in the next 10 years we simply don't know just how bad things might be. Without the BBC, universality of news service might dry up, investment in UK programmes and journalism would be substantially damaged and we might find ourselves with total market failure. It would resolve the tensions between preserving an innovative and varied ecology in media and needing a public service champion, but a global representative is going to take some bold and creative thinking.</p> <p>The BBC has rather limply and belatedly suggested sharing its toys with broadcasters in the spirit of \"partnership\". Philip Graf, the deputy chairman of Ofcom and author of a report on the BBC's online services, reacted to proposals to open up access to competitors for some BBC services with lukewarm scepticism. One of his key recommendations was that the BBC should be more transparent and linked on the web - providing aggregation of other private and public sector sites.</p> <p>This is something the BBC still struggles to do with any consistency or determination. As an aggregational platform for the best of UK content the BBC could build an awesome presence - and be a friendly enemy, or frenemy, to all. It should be open not just to all broadcasters but to all content creators. And hopefully the smell of burning from the barn may be replaced by the scent of roses.</p>",
  "<p>Wall Street has been branded \"The Street of $creams\" by the New York Post, and grim-faced US pundits talk nightly of mayhem in the markets. \"Tonight, breaking news,\" drawled CNN's septuagenarian host Larry King the other night. \"Wall Street takes another nose dive. Investors panic. Should you?\" </p> <p>While investors are certainly panicking, there's little doubt that the sharp suits and smooth talkers of Madison Avenue - shorthand for the city's advertising industry - are also bracing themselves for the effect of consumers tightening their belts. </p> <p>Yet if the prospects for advertising look worse than they have in decades, a few minutes in the company of Shelly Lazarus, the chairman and chief executive of WPP-owned Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide - whose clients include IBM, Dove, Cisco, Motorola and American Express - will have you questioning your assumptions. Exuding the old-school charm and self-assurance of a seasoned politician, Lazarus acknowledges the volatility of the current climate while insisting that the authoritative voice of the marketer needs to be heard through the clamour. </p> <p>\"There's panic right now, but I think when you have a situation like this, reassuring the public is a very important role we can play as communicators,\" she says, measuring her words carefully. </p> <p>\"It can take the form of the full-page advertisements we're seeing in the Wall Street Journal right now, which say, 'This institution is fine', or it could just be email messages or letters. But from the institutions you trust - or used to trust - where you've put your money, I do think it's important for someone to come forward and say: 'Your money's OK. This is not the Great Depression and you don't have to go and withdraw all your funds!'\" </p> <p>But what of the balance sheet in Lazarus's own industry? America's advertising sector was already expecting a torrid year, with ad spending down in the first half of 2008, before the Wall Street crisis began. How does she think the current turbulence will affect Ogilvy's business? </p> <p>\"We've had a very strong performance so far this year, but it's got to happen that, in this kind of environment, clients will start to look at whether they can pull back a bit,\" she replies cagily. \"And we are starting to see it. It's not significant for any one company - and I actually do think that companies know the smart ones continue to spend through recessionary times, because you can pick up market share ...\" She snatches a quick breath. \"But, having said that, if you have 20 clients who each cut a million bucks from their advertising budgets in the fourth quarter, then you've got a problem. So, yes, I do think there will be an impact for us in the fourth quarter.\" </p> <p>In fact, the banking crisis has already hit Ogilvy's bottom line. A few days after this interview, it emerged that Wachovia, the troubled US bank that was acquired a week ago by Citigroup, had \"paused\" its decision to award its advertising business to a group of agencies owned by WPP, led by Ogilvy. As Citigroup has an existing arrangement with other agencies, this development is thought likely to leave Ogilvy out in the cold. With Lazarus away in India when the news broke, the agency declined to comment. </p> <p>Some industry analysts have speculated that the big advertising corporations - with their high staffing levels and prestigious offices in several cities - will find it harder to weather the economic storm than leaner \"boutique\" agencies. But Lazarus, whose 40-year career has stretched from the tail-end of the Mad Men era to today's brave new(ish) world of digital marketing, says everyone will find the going tough. \"I think everybody's going to be hit because of this focus [by clients] on keeping a sharp eye on costs.\" </p> <p>The retail market, she predicts, will be affected by American consumers waiting for things to settle. \"People are just hunkering down at the moment. Even if you have money, it doesn't feel appropriate to spend it right now. It's not the dollars, it's the mindset. Any big expenditure that can be postponed is being looked at as discretionary. So instead they're staying home, watching TV. Sales of salty snacks are up. When I last checked, the sale of wine was up. And the cable companies - as of two weeks ago - say no one's cutting back at all.\" </p> <p>One of the most prominent figures in US advertising, Rochelle B Lazarus was born in Brooklyn in 1947. She was one of just four women in her MBA class at Columbia University and joined Ogilvy when advertising was still very much a booze-fuelled club for boys. She also arrived at a time when the firm's founder - the industry colossus David Ogilvy - still walked its corridors, proclaiming the importance of brand-building through creativity. </p> <p>Lazarus, who is married to a paediatrician, Dr George Lazarus, and has three grown-up children, is credited with, among many other things, landing IBM as an exclusive client in 1994 - luring the corporate giant away from 70 agencies worldwide. She has a reputation for playing hardball and a steely personality is said to lurk beneath the controlled charm. </p> <p>\"I would say Shelly's been the most effective person, never mind woman, in the New York advertising world in the last decade,\" says an executive from another agency. \"She knows exactly what she wants and how to get it. She's achieved everything she set out to achieve. But there's nothing Sex and the City about her, if you know what I mean. She's too respectable, too poised.\"</p> <p>In January, Lazarus - who is on the board of a host of organisations ranging from General Electric to the American Museum of National History - will step down as CEO, although she will remain chairman. \"I'll still be a full-time working chairman,\" she stresses quickly, in case there was any lingering doubt. </p> <p>So what are the biggest changes Lazarus, who will be replaced as chief executive by Miles Young, who has been running Ogilvy's Asia Pacific operation, has seen over her four decades in the trade? \"When I started in this business, if you had two television commercials, three print ads, some radio and a little bit of outdoor [billboards], that was something in those days,\" she recalls. \"And if you look at who was working in ad agencies in the Mad Men days and you see who's here now ... it's people from all over the world now, the number of women is far higher. And everything in this business has a global perspective now. We run global accounts out of Beijing and Bangalore, we never used to do that.\" </p> <p>Today, says Lazarus, clients expect \"big ideas\" expressed across an array of media platforms. \"There's not just an openness, but a hunger to see what's possible. There's almost disappointment when you bring a client a media plan that looks like something they would have seen two years ago. They want new ideas. They want to know how to deal with the blogosphere.\" </p> <p>What does she make of the advertising potential of the social networking phenomenon, particularly Facebook? \"The issue there is, 'Yes, it's a big, big thing, but how do you advertise on it?'.</p> <p>We've yet to figure out how to make [social networking platforms] commercial vehicles, because there's no question of their role in people's lives. But what is the killer advertising application? </p> <p>\"I'm not convinced banner ads and display ads do all that much. There are guys in the business who will show you those great charts, which say that people spend 20% of their time online and those dumb advertisers only spend 4% of their budgets there. Well, not so fast. How many times do you click on a display ad when you're online? And if you're not doing it and your friends aren't doing it, then you have to ask, who is? I think what the next few years are all about is figuring out how you advertise on the internet beyond display ads.\" </p> <p>But if she thinks Facebook's moment as an effective advertising platform has yet to arrive, she's convinced that \"branded content\" - a term that refers to brands playing an active role in TV drama or made-for-web video, rather than old-style product placement - is an increasingly important part of what advertising agencies do. </p> <p>\"We've had the experience with Pond's [skin cream] in this TV show called The Starter Wife. You don't realise it, but there's always a moment in the show when, just as the lead character [played by the Will &amp; Grace star Debra Messing], who's taking life on again after her husband has left her for another woman, goes out into the world, she actually puts Pond's on her face. Now, that is a really cool thing for a brand. It says, 'I'm all set, I'm ready to go and take on the world.' </p> <p>\"This is part of the future of advertising. All parts of the media are coming together. One of the things we're doing in Singapore for Johnnie Walker is video-cams in bars. You can check out 25 different bars in Singapore at any one given moment and decide which one you want to go to. </p> <p>\"These days if you can think it, you can do it,\" she explains. \"People shouldn't wring their hands and worry about how fast everything's changing. I always think that it's so much more interesting when we do things that have never been done before.\" She laughs. \"That can be pretty wild, actually.\" </p> <p><strong>Curriculum vitae </strong><br><strong>Age</strong> 61<br><strong>Education</strong> Smith College (BA), Columbia University (MBA)<br><strong>Career</strong><br><strong>1970</strong> Clairol, assistant product manager<br><strong>1971</strong> Ogilvy &amp; Mather, account executive<br><strong>1987</strong> O&amp;M Direct, general manager, then president<br><strong>1991</strong> O&amp;M New York, president<br><strong>1994</strong> President of O&amp;M North America; won IBM as an exclusive client<br><strong>1995</strong> O&amp;M Worldwide, chief operations officer and president<br><strong>1996</strong> O&amp;M CEO, then chairman<br><strong>2008</strong> Announced retirement as CEO.

  "<p>The EU's plans for a collective response to the global financial crisis were in tatters last night after Germany said it would guarantee all private savings to prevent panic withdrawals - just a day after criticising the Irish for doing the same.</p> <p>Angela Merkel, the chancellor, said in Berlin: \"We're saying to savers that their deposits are secure.\" Peer Steinbr\u00fcck, the finance minister, added: \"I'd like to stress that we'll make sure that no German saver should fear losing a euro of their deposits.\"</p> <p>Their comments came hours after it emerged that the EU is forcing Ireland to substantially change its plans to offer all savers and businesses an unlimited guarantee on their bank deposits.</p> <p>Neelie Kroes, the EU competition commissioner, said the Irish scheme, adopted without consulting either Brussels or other European governments, was discriminatory and would be modified. \"A guarantee without limits is not allowed,\" she told Dutch TV.</p> <p>The EU's top four leaders, including Merkel, slapped down Dublin's go-it-alone approach at an emergency summit on Saturday after the European commission had earlier forced Greece to row back on a similar plan to provide limitless guarantees for bank deposits.</p> <p>The commission will soon propose laws to lift the EU-wide minimum guarantee from the current \u20ac20,000 (\u00a315,500) and ensure speedier payment if banks become insolvent. But Merkel jumped ahead, pledging that the German scheme - which relies on high street banks to pay out above the minimum - would be wholly state-guaranteed.</p> <p>As the four leaders - Gordon Brown, Merkel, Italy's Silvio Berlusconi and host Nicolas Sarkozy, France's president - called for a new global financial system and an end to \"speculative\" capitalism, Peter Mandelson, the incoming business secretary, said the crisis could spark a new wave of economic nationalism.</p> <p>Mandelson, EU trade commissioner for the past four years and a critic of the Irish and Greek schemes, said the danger was that each country could undermine a collective response by looking for a \"get out of jail free\" card.</p> <p>On Saturday, clearly aware that they could be facing the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, the four leaders backed Sarkozy's call for a global summit to draw up a new international financial system to replace the one adopted at Bretton Woods in 1944.</p> <p>Sarkozy urged a summit of the G8 countries, together with China, India, South Africa, Brazil, Mexico and Indonesia, by next month at the latest.</p> <p>\"We are laying the foundations of entrepreneurial capitalism, not speculative capitalism,\" he told journalists. \"After this crisis we will have built the pillars of a new financial world.\" Tougher international regulation should be applied to all financial market players, including hedge funds, he said.</p> <p>The summit in effect buried temporarily the strict 3% budget deficit limit imposed by the Maastricht treaty as EU governments are forced to bail out stricken banks with hundreds of billions of euros, putting huge strains on their budgets.</p> <p>Claude Gu\u00e9ant, a Sarkozy adviser, said that did not mean EU countries would \"wriggle out\" of commitments towards a balanced budget by 2012. \"We are in exceptional circumstances but that does not mean France will let its deficit run away,\" he told French radio.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Who else has introduced 100% deposit guarantees?</strong></p> <p>Ireland: Dublin sparked anger a week ago when it guaranteed all deposits in the six biggest Irish banks for the next two years. Critics have warned that the guarantee risked bankrupting the entire republic, while other European governments and banks complained it could breach EU state aid rules and distort competition. The pledge covers deposits in the UK Post Office savings account, which is run by Bank of Ireland. The scheme could be widened to include others including Ulster Bank, owned by Royal Bank of Scotland. </p> <p>Ireland had previously guaranteed bank deposits up to \u20ac20,000, which it had raised to \u20ac100,000 just weeks ago.</p> <p>Greece: the Greek finance minister said on Thursday that deposits in \"all banks that operate in Greece\" would be \"absolutely guaranteed\" following an emergency cabinet meeting on how to insulate the country from the global financial crisis. Under existing law, the Greek government guarantees just the first \u20ac20,000 of savers' deposits. </p> <p>The minister, George Alogoskoufis, sought to assuage growing signs of nervousness in Greece, reassuring the public that the country's banks remained \"safe and solvent\".</p> <p><strong>... and who might be next?</strong></p> <p>Though it is unclear which governments might be tempted to offer a sweeping guarantee, Britain last week said it would raise it on savings from \u00a335,000 to \u00a350,000 to bolster confidence and stem a flood of money into Irish banks. France, which had been rumoured to be following Ireland's lead, is already one of the most generous in Europe, guaranteeing \u20ac70,000. </p> <p>The Netherlands guarantees \u20ac40,000 and most of Europe, including Italy and Spain, guarantees \u20ac20,000. Some of the most exposed banks are in Belgium and Denmark, while panic selling hit shares in Italy's biggest bank, Unicredit.</p>",

  "<p>Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose ... This has always struck me as one of the cleverest lines ever to turn up in a pop lyric. I first heard it one night in December 1968, when Lou Reed took me down to a club in Greenwich Village to hear a new singer called Kris Kristofferson. After we heard the set, we went back to Max's restaurant and I didn't actually meet Kristofferson until nearly three years later, when I came upon him crawling through the dog-flap at Janis Joplin's house, not long after her death, and just before her version of his song Me and Bobby McGee became a huge hit. </p> <p>Throughout 2008, the French and Germans have been treating 1968 as their year, prattling about May 68 as if it were a revolution, when the real energy had been boiling up for years in America. To hear European survivors tell it, there never was an anti-Vietnam war movement, no armies of the night, no Democratic Convention in Chicago, no yippies. I have always thought of May 68 as a small European spinoff from the American hurricane, an old-fashioned student revolt that failed to find support from organised labour and collapsed after a brief orgasm of direct action. Though the events of May 68 in France are supposed to have \"shaken the regime to its foundations\", the moribund Gaullist party was reinvigorated and swept back to power a mere month later. A Paris jeweller has celebrated the anniversary by making silver cobblestone pendants in various sizes. The smallest sells for \u00a3150.</p> <p>Chucking cobblestones is nowhere near as clever as writing Me and Bobby McGee. Busted flat in Baton Rouge, heading for the trains - riding the rail cars across the immensity of America has always represented freedom. A significant number of our young long for that freedom, freedom from school, family and authority, freedom to encounter the world, even though it might mean hardship, loss and pain, just as freedom does for any other animal. No word is more abused, unless it be the word \"free\" itself - which is used to describe a world where the reality is debt slavery, where students now demonstrate against insecurity and grant-cutting, rather than against Guant\u00e1namo and unjust wars waged against civilians.</p> <p>Though the word \"freedom\" shimmers in the imagination, it dies in embodiment, to become a mockery. You have only to look at the hideous figure of Freedom that stands atop the dome of the Capitol in Washington DC. This 20ft bronze, designed by Thomas Crawford in 1855, represents a woman, wrapped in what appears to be a tasselled curtain, wearing a star-circled helmet with a crest of an eagle's head, feathers and talons, resting one hand on a sword in its scabbard, and clutching a shield and a laurel wreath on the other. As she stands on a globe supported by fasces and the motto E Pluribus Unum, she might as well represent fascism as freedom. As long as the iconogaphy of freedom is derived from Roman art, the image can hardly fail to be redolent of fascism; Roman Libertas does not run or skip, but stands stern, rock-like and forbidding, like the Statue of Liberty at the entrance to New York harbour. With her crown of seven rays representing all seven seas and seven continents, the Statue of Liberty bespeaks world domination rather more clearly than it does freedom, but the total effect is simply bombast. </p> <p>Gigantism is a feature of the art of totalitarian regimes, and both these objects are huge in conception, meant both to dominate their environment and intimidate the beholder. The World Trade Centre was built with the same intention; the Freedom Tower now under construction at Ground Zero will be as big. Its cornerstone, laid in July 2004, states that it is being built as \"a tribute to the enduring spirit of freedom\", whatever that might be. More than one critic of the design has observed that it testifies more clearly to paranoia and fear than to any sense of freedom. Freedom, it would seem, is anti-monumental in essence. </p> <p>The art of the 60s counterculture was almost all bad. All the flower children and peaceniks were capable of was a stream of doodlings, recycled William Morris, a little dada, co-opted Kollwitz, and so forth. The dreariness of today's graffiti continues the tradition of visual illiteracy. </p> <p>The music was a different matter. Sixties musical culture was as deep as the visual culture was shallow. All the artists you heard of were only the visible parts of an iceberg of submerged musical activity that was going on in every small town across America. Integral to the tradition, whether blues, rhythm'n'blues, bluegrass, country or folk, was protest - and protest is an essential element of freedom. Every dictator will abuse the name of freedom, will erect hideous lumps of masonry and call them Freedom This and Freedom That, or simply rename old monuments, as the King Memorial Tower in Tehran was renamed Freedom Tower. States are authoritarian structures; to call them free is oxymoronic. Freedom cannot be built, but it can be sung.</p>",
  "<p>Over morning newspapers with the Today programme in my ear, I eye my garden nervously. If I ripped up the roses and the lavender, how many rows of potatoes could I fit in? Enough to feed a family? Is this madness or not? And why is it that I no longer trust the economists and policymakers to give me a straight answer to that question?</p> <p>There is a strange air of suspense. Everyone agrees that things could get grim, but what does that mean? Grim, as in a bit of nasty unemployment, or grim, as in total economic breakdown with queues for soup kitchens and millions living off their allotments? If the latter sounds fanciful, there are countries like Argentina and Russia who can tell you from bitter recent experience what happens when economies collapse. </p> <p>Gordon Brown, fearful of \"self-fulfilling prophecies\", instead offers a tinny upbeat message. Everyone knows now that it is all about confidence: will savers panic and move their money to Ireland, crippling British banks? The circumspection of the wise men becomes sinister. On the Today programme, John Humphrys pressed Richard Lambert, director general of the CBI, for his forecast. Lambert hesitated, replying with, \"my hope is ...\". \"No, no,\" interrupted Humphrys, \"what is your forecast?\" There was another hesitation before Lambert nervously \"forecast\" a grim 18 months before life resumed as normal. It sounded like a hope. No one has any idea what is going to happen. </p> <p>No sooner do economists or government ministers make a pronouncement using words such as \"impossibility\", \"unlikely\" or \"never\", than they are having to eat them. If these are uncharted waters then perhaps we are at the moment when the tsunami is visible on the horizon, and the tide has suddenly retreated, and fish are stranded, gasping for oxygen all over the beach. </p> <p>But don't get too bogged down in seed catalogues (and forget trying to get your head around collateralised debt obligations - even the Financial Times's banking correspondents admit it is \"fiendishly complicated\"), the average citizen has a far more important plot to unravel: how did we get in this mess, and how do we make sure it doesn't happen again?</p> <p>Answering these two questions does not require a crash course in City finance and economics, because this crisis is as much about politics and ideology as anything. If you're pressed for time, the reading list can be very short. Key is Karl Polanyi's The Great Transformation, published in 1944, an economic history which sets out to explain 1929, the Great Depression and the rise of fascism. Polanyi's book came out the same year as another influential Austrian economist, Friedrich Hayek, brought out the central text of neoliberalism, The Road to Serfdom.</p> <p>Hayek became the founding father of a model of economic management which has brought us to the current crisis; Polanyi, with extraordinary prescience, warned that the crisis would come; he rejected the idea that the market is a \"self-regulating\" mechanism which can correct itself. There is no \"invisible hand\" such as the neoliberals maintain, so there is nothing inevitable or \"natural\" about the way markets work: they are always shaped by political decisions.</p> <p>At the time Polanyi was writing, there were many who agreed with him that free-market capitalism was chronically and destructively unstable, with terrible political consequences. But in the 70s and 80s, Hayek's neoliberalism began to take hold on the US ruling elite, Margaret Thatcher was recruited - and in due course Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. \"Roll back the state, leave the economy to run itself\" has held sway ever since. As Ann Pettifor points out on her website, debtonation.org, Alan Greenspan wrote enthusiastically in August that \"the past decade has seen mounting global forces (the international version of Adam Smith's invisible hand) quietly displacing government control of economic affairs\". He blithely continued that the greatest danger facing the economy was that \"some governments, bedevilled by emerging inflationary forces, will endeavour to reassert their grip on economic affairs\". Last week, Greenspan did a gigantic volte-face as he pleaded for government to do just that - reassert its grip in the form of the bail-out.</p> <p>We are now learning what countries across the developing world have experienced over three decades: unstable and inequitable neoliberal economics leads to unacceptable levels of social disruption and hardship that can only be contained by brutal repression. Add that to the two other central charges against deregulated capitalism: first, it may create wealth but it does not distribute it effectively; and second, that it takes no account of what it cannot commodify - neither the social relationships of family and community nor the environment, which are vital to human wellbeing, and indeed to the functioning of the market itself. Ultimately, neoliberal capitalism is self-destructive.</p> <p>We are now witnessing the collapse of this absurd economic orthodoxy that has dominated politics for nearly 30 years. Its triumphalist arrogance, its insistence on orthodoxy, has been comparable to Soviet communism in its scale. For two decades, we've been told \"Tina\" - \"There is no alternative\". </p> <p>Economists talk of trust, belief, faith; we now understand that all along neoliberal capitalism was a form of mythology. That's why the triumphalism was necessary - you could not afford to have anyone challenge the system or we might all realise we were gawping at the emperor's nakedness. Rowan Williams was right to quote Marx, that \"unbridled capitalism becomes a kind of mythology, ascribing reality, power and agency to things that have no life in themselves\". Richard Dawkins should be critiquing this superstitious belief system. </p> <p>Fortunately Thomas Frank did so in his brilliant book, One Market Under God (2001). This is the second book on the reading list, because it explains how neoliberalism entrenched its triumphalism into the political system of the US; how it marginalised and delegitimised all challenge and established hegemony in the so-called free world. </p> <p>Now, as it all totters, we can take stock. We can ask how and why the critique - of which Frank was a part and Polanyi the bible - which was emerging in the late 90s was crippled. The anti-globalisation movement argued that neoliberal capitalism was unjust, unstable and destructive to human and environmental wellbeing. Sounds sensible now, but at the time it mysteriously got smeared by association with anarchists with a penchant for smashing Starbucks' windows. The broad network of social grassroots movements - US unions, Mexican peasants, Indian farmers - were misnamed, misunderstood, ridiculed and ignored. There is no alternative, the politicians intoned mantra-like.</p> <p>Then 9/11 and for the next seven years a sideshow was offered as a distraction with caricature villains and thriller drama. While eyes were on the absurd charade of the \"threat of Islamist terrorism to western civilisation\", the real doomsday scenario that poses a far greater threat to western civilisation (whatever that is) was gathering pace right next to Ground Zero, in Wall Street. </p> <p>As in all mythologies, the only option, according to Timothy Garton Ash (not noted for his religious faith) on these pages recently, is to pray. What makes me frightened is that this is a corrupt mythology which, like that of the Aztecs, may require a lot of human sacrifice. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:m.bunting@theguardian.com\">m.bunting@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Help the Aged and Friends of the Earth will launch a high court judicial review today to force the government to stand by promises made in 2000 to eradicate fuel poverty and help millions of households facing a winter of burgeoning <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/householdbills\">gas and electricity bills</a>. </p> <p>The charities said the government was legally bound by promises it made in legislation passed in 2000, in which it undertook to abolish fuel poverty by 2016 and to eliminate it among the most vulnerable households by 2010. The hearing is scheduled to last two days, with a judgment expected within six weeks. </p> <p>Households in fuel poverty are defined as those in which more than 10% of income is spent on energy. But far from the numbers falling, the past year has seen a steep increase as gas and electricity bills have rocketed.</p> <p>Official figures last week showed that in 2006 3.5m households - 1m more than in 2005 - spent more than a 10th of their income on heating and power. The figure included 2.75m \"vulnerable\" households, such as those with children, elderly people or the long-term sick. </p> <p>Since then, Help the Aged and Friends of the Earth said the situation had deteriorated dramatically, following several hikes in tariffs by the major power suppliers. They estimate that as many as 5m households, many of them those of pensioners, now face a stark choice of \"heat or eat\". </p> <p>Mervyn Kohler, special adviser for Help the Aged, said: \"Though fuel poverty is high on the media and political agendas, government actions to reduce it fall far short of the crisis it is creating for millions of pensioners and low-income families.</p> <p>\"It is vital that the government comes up with an effective strategy for tackling fuel poverty. Low-income households need crisis payments simply to get through the coming winter, but in the longer term, the energy efficiency of our homes must be improved. The government has a legal duty to do this.\" </p> <p>The charities argue that the government has broken the law by not doing everything reasonably practicable to meet its fuel poverty targets. They claim the government has failed to provide a comprehensive and costed plan of action for meeting its targets; failed to set a minimum standard of energy efficiency for affected households, and ignored repeated criticism from the independent Fuel Poverty Advisory Group.</p> <p>Hilary Benn, environment minister, said the government was committed to tackling fuel poverty but \"sharply rising energy prices have made that goal increasingly difficult\".</p> <p>The government said tackling fuel poverty was a high-priority policy and that it had pledged \u00a31bn to help struggling householders. Since 2000, \u00a320bn had been spent on a range of benefits and programmes to improve fuel efficiency and help those in need of assistance.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/economy\">Treasury</a> was under pressure last night to guarantee the savings of all depositors in British banks after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/germany\">Germany</a> announced it was following the lead of Ireland and Greece and offering a blanket guarantee on all savings - currently worth \u20ac568bn (\u00a3440bn). Late last night Denmark followed suit. </p> <p>Britain had just agreed to raise its maximum level from \u00a335,000 to \u00a350,000, but may now need to take more radical steps to avoid a flight of savings. </p> <p>British officials were furious with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. They said she gave no indication of the move at a summit in Paris on Saturday designed to coordinate a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/europe\">European</a> response to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">economic crisis</a>. The Treasury was last night trying to establish the implications of the German move.</p> <p>Speaking of the decision by the Greek and Irish governments to offer blanket guarantees, the new business secretary, Peter Mandelson, said yesterday: \"It would be better while operating on a country by country basis, we did so in a coordinated way and we brought a collective European view. We are all interlocked. We are in this together.\"</p> <p>Denmark later guaranteed all bank deposits as part of a deal with banks to set up a \u00a33.6bn liquidation fund.</p> <p>The German move came as the Treasury was preparing a contingency plan to take a stake in failing British banks to recapitalise them. This gained the support of the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats yesterday. </p> <p>Today the chancellor, Alistair Darling, is due to make his first Commons statement on the credit crunch since the financial turmoil exploded on the markets, but he is not expected to make any major policy statements or announce support for recapitalisation with taxpayers' money. </p> <p>However, he hinted that ministers were looking at more dramatic options when he told BBC 1's Andrew Marr Show he was \"looking at a whole range of proposals ... and that means looking at some pretty big steps that you would not take in ordinary times, but we are ready to take them\". </p> <p>Mandelson said every option, including recapitalisation to take a non-controlling stake in a bank rather than a government takeover, would have to be considered. </p> <p>In a significant shift in position, the Tory leader, David Cameron, said he favoured a recapitalisation to strengthen the banking system. \"It is something parties should talk about, and I think it is something where consensus would be better than opposition.\" Previously the Tories had spoken of ailing banks being taken over by the Bank of England to run them down and sell off their profitable assets. </p> <p>The shadow chancellor, George Osborne, said yesterday that the government might need to follow the lead of Sweden in the 1990s and buy stakes in a host of banks to shore up their finances. \"The ad-hoc approach is coming to an end and we need to look at much bigger solutions,\" he said. \"We stand here willing to talk to the government about this. Gordon Brown's approach - which is 'look, I'm going to deal with this on a case by case basis' - is running out of road.\"</p> <p>Cameron added: \"The problem at the moment is that the banks are not lending to one another, the Bank of England is meant to be the lender of the last resort. There is a danger of it becoming the lender of the only resort. There is only one thing worse than state aid for the banks, and that is doing nothing.\" </p> <p>Darling has already allowed the Bank to put \u00a340bn into the market this week to ease the problems of banks accessing money, but there are increasing signs that this is dealing merely with the symptoms of the problem.</p> <p>The chancellor also gave a broad hint that he feels the Bank of England is free to cut interest rates on Thursday when he said its remit was not confined to controlling inflation. \"The Bank of England also has a wider duty to support the government's economic objectives,\" he said. </p> <p>He did, however, reject calls from the Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman, Vince Cable, to specifically change the Bank's remit, saying such a move would undermine its independence. Cable had warned: \"We are in a real crisis situation. In an edge of the cliff environment.\" </p> <p>Darling is due today to publish his banking reform bill and jointly chair the first meeting of the new national economic council. The bill will contain measures on guaranteeing depositors' savings, and follows talks with Conservatives and Liberal Democrats.</p> <p>On Wednesday, in the Mais lecture, Darling is expected to drop a broad hint that the scale of government borrowing, in part induced by the financial crisis, means he will be unable to meet the government's so-called sustainable investment rule.</p> <p>The rule laid out by Brown when chancellor in 1997 sets out that borrowing must be strictly limited to ensure that Britain's total public sector debt never exceeds 40%of national income.</p> <p>Without setting out entirely new rules on borrowing and investment, Darling said he would set out in his talk his thoughts on what the new rules should be.</p>",
  "<p>Peter Mandelson yesterday admitted he sought the sanction of Tony Blair before agreeing to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/03/mandelson.labour2\">Gordon Brown's offer of a return to the cabinet for the third time</a>. Blair told Mandelson the decision on whether to take the role of business secretary, and abandon his post as EU trade commissioner early, was \"a no-brainer\".</p> <p>Mandelson said he had been surprised to be offered the job. \"I took some time to say yes, but in the end I thought it was the only thing I could and should do,\" he said.</p> <p>The appointment, which is still causing shockwaves at Westminster, has led to tensions among some former Blairites who had set their minds on trying to oust Brown, believing he is going to lose the party the next election. </p> <p>A News of the World-ICM poll of Britain's 192 most marginal parliamentary seats yesterday put the Tories on 43%, Labour on 34% and the Liberal Democrats on 15% - and in some estimates would give David Cameron's Conservatives a 78-seat majority. At 11.5%, the swing from Labour to Tory in the marginal seats was higher than the national swing. </p> <p>In a television interview, Mandelson twice failed to take up the suggestion that Brown was certain to lead Labour into the next election. Elsewhere at the weekend he said he would be \"joined at the hip\" in future with Brown, but he must be aware that if the polls still look gruesome for the prime minister, he will be seen as a focus of any plot. He insisted that this was not his aim, saying: \"I have always been a member of the Labour family and when times gets tough, families pull together. We are all part of the same team now - that is what the party wants and it is what the country needs.\" </p> <p>He described Brown as having \"a very steady hand on the tiller\".</p> <p>Mandelson also revealed he had spoken to children's secretary Ed Balls twice on Saturday. He said the prime minister told him it was not true that Balls had argued he should not be brought back into British politics. \"I don't see any problem between [Balls] and me. We have a very, very similar view of the situation and what we have to do to dig ourselves out of it.\"</p> <p>Balls has admitted that the return of Mandelson was a risk, but insisted it could work. Another Brownite cabinet minister insisted: \"I think it will work. It is not a slam dunk, but it is brave.\" </p> <p>Other members of the cabinet, including Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman, have insisted Mandelson has been brought back to strengthen the economic team. Mandelson also said he had no role in the reorganisation within Downing Street, including the removal of Brown's press adviser Damian McBride from frontline briefing. \"It is not my job to do that,\" Mandelson insisted. \"I have never met Damian McBride in my life.\"</p> <p>He revealed he had been asked by the prime minister to go to Downing Street on Thursday afternoon, and assumed it was to discuss what advice he could give on the reshuffle. Mandelson has been in regular contact with the prime minister, initially over how to keep the Doha world trade round intact, but increasingly to discuss domestic politics.</p> <p>Talking about his discussion of Brown's offer with Blair on Thursday evening, Mandelson said Blair told him: \"It's a no-brainer.\" Blair's endorsement of Mandelson is a blow to David Miliband, the foreign secretary, who has been encouraged by many Blairities to take risks and steel himself for a challenge for the premiership.</p> <p>His chances of succeeding Brown had anyway temporarily been reduced by his performance at the Labour conference in Manchester, but he remained the bookmakers' favourite to succeed Brown. </p> <p>Some Blairities believe former health secretary Alan Milburn would have been a better figure than Mandelson for Brown to recall from political obscurity, since he would have brought more Labour MPs with him. Mandelson has not been popular in the parliamentary party and anyway has been absent from British politics for four years. He will also be less able to hold political sway over the party from the Lords if the next few months become politically choppy again for the prime minister. But Milburn has been critical of the prime minister to his face, which probably makes a comeback impossible.</p> <p>In his interview with Sky News, Mandelson also briefly discussed the global economic crisis. He said: \"We have got to look at the financial and economic system as a patient that has been afflicted by some very nasty medical attacks. </p> <p>\"First we have got to stabilise the patient, bring liquidity back into the position to top up confidence in the banking system. Secondly we have got to look at the symptoms where these problems are attacking and take firm and decisive action that the Bank of England and the government have already started to do. Then we have got to restore the patient to health and make sure what we are seeing now does not happen again. </p> <p>\"How we exactly do that is not exactly clear and it is not clear to anyone. We have got to put the best minds on the job, apply the best specialists to this, we have got to listen , consult, discuss. It does not mean reaching out for the first policy option that comes along, nor does it mean delay.\"</p>",
  "<p>When Alex Day started keeping a video diary on YouTube, he wasn't sure how it would turn out. The teenager, from Hornchurch in Essex, admits that he was just looking for some frank feedback on his funny stories and songs.</p> <p>\"I was making a video podcast to entertain family and friends - just a little comedy series,\" he said. Eighteen months on, 19-year-old Day, known by his nickname Nerimon, boasts more than 30,000 subscribers and is one of Britain's most popular YouTubers. </p> <p>Armed with cheap video cameras and the internet, a generation of youngsters are growing up very publicly with online videos - and being failed by adults who are not paying proper attention to this new medium.</p> <p>That claim is made in a research paper published today by the thinktank Demos. The study, Video Republic, examines the rise of the YouTube generation and considers how their enthusiasm and skills can be encouraged.</p> <p>\"It's now as normal for teenagers to write a blog as it is to write a diary - that's a massive shift,\" said Celia Hannon, a researcher with Demos and the lead author of the report.</p> <p>\"Youngsters are working out their relationship to the outside world and forging an identity.\"</p> <p>The report makes recommendations to help adults cope with the changing online environment, and calls particularly on schools to help youngsters understand the long-term implications of living their lives in a semi-public way. </p> <p>\"Schools, universities and businesses should prepare young people for an era where CVs may well be obsolete, enabling them to manage their online reputation,\" says the report. \"This generation of young people are guineapigs ... we need an educational response that extends beyond the focus of safety, towards broader questions of privacy and intellectual property.\"</p> <p>It also suggests that creating video blogs and online diaries should be part of the school curriculum, used by schools in the same way that they organise museum trips or extra art classes.</p> <p>Statistics show that the influence of online video is growing. Ten hours of video is uploaded to YouTube every minute of the day, and not all of it is karate-kicking chimps and dogs on skateboards. Figures from earlier this year suggest Britons are watching more than 3.6bn videos online each month - a rise of 56% from last year. YouTube, which is owned by internet giant Google, dominates the market with 20 million viewers in Britain, while the BBC trails a distant second with fewer than 6.5 million online viewers.</p> <p>Mainstream broadcasters are recognising the shift in consumption: the American cable broadcaster HBO recently launched a new show, Hooking Up, featuring a swath of popular YouTube stars. Although many web surfers have scoffed at what they see as a cynical attempt to cash in, the move exemplifies how the adult world is trying to reach out to video-friendly youth.</p> <p>The report also says that politicians can use online video as a way to engage with youngsters, who can sometimes be seen as apathetic and unreachable. But Hannon said such a strategy would only succeed if they were prepared to approach the internet on its own terms.</p> <p>\"The government is pouring vast amounts of money into this, because they feel young people should be making themselves heard,\" she said. \"But people can see through it - bloggers say it feels contrived.\" </p> <p>Instead, she offered the example of the US presidential candidate Barack Obama, who has seen intense interest from young voters after he encouraged them to exercise their creative urges online, instead of simply dictating his ideas to them. \"Obama is the first 'YouTube politician' because he gets that you can't control it. His campaign team get that it's about the enthusiasm.\"</p> <p>For Alex Day, there are no plans to give up any time soon. \"Thirty thousand, one hundred people watch me now and it'd be very unfair of me to suddenly stop and say 'just go watch someone else',\" he said. \"It's a lot of people so I'll always feel a commitment to putting out things they'll enjoy, in some form or another.\"</p>",
  "<p>It is hard, sometimes, to remember that I don't have a vote in the US election. The media coverage is constant, my Twitter feed is full of it, and it is all that the blogs I read seem to be interested in - even the non-political ones. While Peter Mandelson is being brought into British government for the third time, the US political scene seems to dazzle with its array of new faces and new personalities. Barack Obama's inspirational idealism and John McCain's time spent as a prisoner of war make our politicians look a little grey and ordinary. And then there's Sarah Palin, who can see Russia from her house. </p> <p>I am someone who really would like to see more women in government, but Palin makes me cringe every time I hear about her. Dan Quayle's repeated gaffes - and who can forget his gnomic remarks and inability to spell potato? - simply made many think that he was an intellectual lightweight. But it's hard not to worry that some people might see Palin's mistakes as a reflection on the intelligence of women in general. From her rambling and incomprehensible answers to simple questions, to her inability to define the Bush doctrine, to her apparent unwillingness to name a single newspaper she reads, her performance seems constantly to support the charge that she is simply not ready to become vice-president of the US. Interestingly, Jed Lewison, writing in the Huffington Post on October 1, dug up footage of Palin performing in debates on Alaskan issues in which she acquitted herself well, suggesting that she might simply have been brought up through the party ranks too quickly rather than that she's entirely incompetent. </p> <p>And although I'd rather see a hard-hitting intellectual woman on either ticket, it has to be said that Palin hasn't sunk McCain's campaign. </p> <p>Of course it's hard for British people to understand why anyone would vote for McCain/Palin. Our political consensus is to the left even of the Democratic Party. For example, even Obama isn't suggesting that the US bring in socialised medicine on the scale of the NHS. But for many centrist voters in America, the desire to vote in more leftwing leaders may be outweighed by other considerations. On a recent visit to the US, I met one or two of that rare breed of American voter whose existence I had previously considered merely a myth: centrists who want to elect a woman candidate, would have voted for Hillary Clinton if she'd been running, but are now intending to vote Republican because Palin is on the ticket.</p> <p>What is this about? One explanation is the classic \"ice-cream vendors on a beach\" model of the two-party system taught to first-year politics undergraduates. This model, first conceived by Harold Hotelling and later developed by Anthony Downs, explains why political parties tend to move closer to one another. Imagine a long stretch of beach, with people evenly distributed along its length. Two ice-cream vendors set up their carts on the beach, one at the exact midpoint of the right-hand side of the beach, the other at the exact midpoint of the left-hand side. They both attract all the customers who are closer to them than to the other vendor; 50% each of the market. But if one vendor moves closer to the middle of the beach, they keep the customers at the extreme end of the beach, but also gain a few of the \"centrist\" customers. In order to gain back the lost ground, the other vendor also has to move toward the middle of the beach. </p> <p>Applying this model to politics suggests that in a two-party system political parties will tend to move closer together over time, both ending up near the median point of voter sympathies. In practice, this would mean that, over time, there is less and less to choose between the political parties. If their policies are often practically identical, the only thing to choose between the candidates may be their religion, ethnicity, gender or sexuality. This would lead to an increasing emphasis on identity politics. </p> <p>But, although the UK may have been getting closer to an equilibrium of this sort over the past 15 years, the US certainly isn't there. On the Iraq war, taxes, healthcare and the environment, McCain and Obama have made their policy differences clear; it's hard to imagine that anyone would feel they were too close together to decide between.</p> <p>Another possible explanation of the increasing importance of identity politics that occurs to me is the decline of trust in politicians. In a survey carried out in 1964, about 75% of Americans said that they trusted the federal government. More recently, surveys have shown that around 75% of Americans now do not trust their government. Perhaps people were simply too naive 40 years ago, or perhaps we're too cynical now. One conclusion is clear to me, though: if you can't trust politicians to keep their promises, then policy statements lose some of their force to motivate the voter. If you believe that politicians will simply break their election promises, then what's left as a rational way to choose between them? </p> <p>The rationale goes that, if elected, a McCain/Palin ticket might or might not actually follow through on any of their policies, but Palin will still - in all probability - remain a woman. For those who feel it would be an important breakthrough to have a woman in the office of vice-president, this is one campaign commitment she can hardly help but keep. </p> <p><strong>This week Naomi watched</strong> the Tom Hanks film Charlie Wilson's War for the second time: \"It impresses even more second time around; intelligent, thoughtful film-making with much to say about the current state of the world.\" <strong>She ate</strong> apples and honey in celebration of Jewish New Year and worried impotently about the plight of the bees.</p>",
  "<p>The financial storm is now on Europe's doorstep. Yesterday the governments of Germany, Italy, Iceland and Belgium were all scrambling to find a solution to national banking crises. The collapse of the bail-out of Hypo Real Estate, Germany's second largest property lender, forced Angela Merkel to do the unthinkable and guarantee all private savings accounts. All across Europe, governments are having the throw the rulebook away. In the UK, Alistair Darling yesterday rejected demands from the authoritative Vince Cable for him to take the unprecedented step of calling on the Bank of England to cut interest rates. As this crisis turns from a financial to an economic one, government intervention will surely become more the rule than the exception.</p> <p>Gordon Brown's two rules, setting tax and spending, look increasingly creaky and may well be relaxed come the pre-budget report this autumn. But Mr Cable was right yesterday to also question the rules over monetary policy. Giving independence to the Bank of England has been acclaimed as politically ingenious and economically sound, but the move has always been susceptible to the claim that it is undemocratic. An unelected band of officials working to an inflexible mandate of an inflation target are left to operate a key lever of economic policy. For the first time since the Bank of England was given operational independence, Treasury officials now privately admit they would have lowered interest rates faster. Mervyn King should narrow that gap by cutting interest rates by half a percentage point this week. But as we have argued, rates should have been cut earlier in this crisis - and steeper. In any case, the government needs to rethink the mandate it has given its central bank. An inflation target is not enough. It must also consider the impact of its decisions on growth and jobs.</p> <p>When New Labour changed the rules of economic policymaking, politicians all over Europe were united by their desire to avoid offending the financial markets by putting anything as obtrusive as a political edge on policymaking. No more. Gordon Brown, Mrs Merkel, Silvio Berlusconi and Nicolas Sarkozy this weekend effectively buried the strict 3% budget deficit limit imposed by the Maastricht treaty, and called for a global summit to draw up nothing less than a new international financial system.</p> <p>One of the great omissions of European economic policymaking is a continental banking regulator. There are global regulators and an array of central banks, but there is nothing in between. As Nicolas V\u00e9ron of the thinktank Bruegel points out, pan-European banks work to 51 national authorities, nine EU committees and some 80 bilateral arrangements. As financial institutions become increasingly international, this system looks out of date. Any of the big banks going belly-up would stretch the capacity of the host government to stump up the cash. </p> <p>The benefits of concerted action would give Europe a bigger role in international discussion on financial regulation. So it should not be surprising that the EU's big four called not just for a new European system of financial regulation but a global one, bringing in China and India - a new Bretton Woods, in fact. This was the system put in place when the global economy was devastated at the end of the second world war, which gave birth to the World Bank and the IMF. It is no exaggeration to say we face a great global challenge now. Turning the IMF into an international regulator of banks and hedge funds might be a good place to start. The call to include China in any new financial order is an astute one. China and the rest of Asia have lent the debtor nations of the west their surplus savings. The old rules no longer apply; the new ones must aim not just at fixing financial markets but at correcting an entire economic model.</p>",
  "<p>What is this new beast called the Department of Energy and Climate Change? Search hard for enlightenment, but don't expect to find it. Apparently, it's a step up for Ed, the acceptable face of Miliband. It may signal a ministerial veto for Kingsnorth coalfired power station in Kent. And, since Ed's partner is a green lawyer, it will doubtless provide hours of happy bedtime conversation. But that, apart from nailing the words \"climate change\" on a Whitehall door, is more or less that. In short, its frivolity reeks. </p> <p>Of course, as in any swift shuffle of amazements, everyone goggles over you-know-who coming back for round three, and seemingly tedious structural things get left on the spike of instant history. Who cares which civil servants have to up-desks again? But, alas, we're talking global warming here. We're confronting a threat that makes credit crunches seem like sugar-coated Krispies. And yet, when push comes to shove, we merely push and shove nameplates around.</p> <p>Practical stuff takes practical time and concentrated effort. American analysts say it will take 10 years to wind up Lehman Brothers. Gordon Brown's administration has 18 months at most to stand and deliver. But stray backstage down dimly lit civil-service corridors, and you soon know what doesn't make sense. </p> <p>How about shovelling in Agriculture, Fisheries and Food with the Department of the Environment five years ago? The sweat of integration there has been long, slow and difficult to make effective. But at least, when Miliband the slightly elder was there, he got on top of his most important responsibility: he made it the clear climate change ministry. Now that's all frittered away. The Department of Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform - a mere 15 months old itself - will be dismembered. Power in its nuclear, fuel-poverty and save-the-planet form goes with Ed. </p> <p>But Hilary Benn, back at what remains of diminished Defra, is left with a rag-bag that doesn't cohere. For what, after all, does climate change mean in practical terms? It means drastic change to our environment. It means flood defences, food crises, the death of wildlife and, intrinsically, of our way of life. Government has an agency to cover that crucial beat. It is called the Environment Agency: and Benn remains its sponsoring minister. Yet now, bizarrely, that agency's role is chucked into the latest mix. Nobody knows how climate change - in Ed's new empire - fits with green monitoring and enforcement over at what's left at Benn's. </p> <p>Remember: you're not dividing along neat borders here, but splitting sub-departments of experts and administrators down the middle. You are ordaining confusion, stasis and years more sortings with more consultants demanding more ripe remuneration trawling through offices.</p> <p>Is there a case for planting climate change at the heart of government policymaking? Of course. It is an obligation beyond day-to-day politicking, the ultimate test and legacy. But slicing around Whitehall one more time doesn't begin to measure up. While Ed ponders fuel poverty this winter, he'll see Hilary mopping up Tewkesbury and Geoff Hoon stacking up planes over Heathrow. (Transport, you may recall, was part of Environment two uprootings ago.) </p> <p>If climate change is as important as prime ministers and presidents say then combatting it by surface shufflings is either stupid or cynical. It's Downing Street's job. It is one conversation with us all that has to come from the top. But no, not now: don't expect much in the way of such seriousness while Ed tries to get his phone connected or find the way to the loo. He is just a symbolic pawn on an irrelevant board. He's another example of divide and hope to rule somehow. He's another hapless definition of frivolity.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:p.preston@theguardian.com\">p.preston@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Chelsea seemed a team apart yesterday, even if Liverpool's comeback at Manchester City means they still have company at the head of the Premier League. It took a keen eye to note that players of Ricardo Carvalho and Deco's status were missing, because Luiz Felipe Scolari's side performed as if they lacked nothing whatsoever. The zest of the line-up is the most important factor of all.</p> <p>These are people blinking in delight at everything life suddenly has to offer. Ashley Cole exemplified that. He has learned well at Stamford Bridge how to be a resourceful defender but now the verve of his youth at Arsenal has returned and is in spate. It swept away these visitors.</p> <p>Cole's key part in the second goal typified that. With fluent interchanging, Florent Malouda and Frank Lampard sent him to the byline in the 44th minute. His concentration was intense as he focused on steering the cutback acutely. It ran perfectly to Michael Ballack. Brad Friedel saved from the German and then Nicolas Anelka, but the France striker eventually got a finish into the net.</p> <p>Chelsea, in theory, lack forwards and, in the absence of Didier Drogba, Anelka is the only seasoned player for that position. That seemed not to matter. It eggs Scolari's men on to set whirling moves in motion from the centre of the pitch. Without outstanding work by Friedel the score would have been a reliable measure of the crushing victory that actually occurred.</p> <p>Villa have been coming on nicely and tests of this severity would make most sides look like abject failures. Martin O'Neill, however, will ponder the evidence. He has picked the same starting line-up in every Premier League fixture to date but the selection process will not be made automatically next time around.</p> <p>The centre-back Curtis Davies was taken off at half-time, having been put in difficulties when he felt obliged to come out of the defence. He could not count on cover from the midfielders despite the fact that O'Neill, pulling Gabriel Agbonlahor on to the right long before the interval, had stationed five men in that area.</p> <p>It was much too simple for Chelsea to identify openings. After 21 minutes, Malouda and Lampard had only to work the ball from left to right for the opener, with Joe Cole clear to belt a finish beyond Friedel. From Villa's perspective there must be exasperation that their entire side had been dragged toward the Chelsea left.</p> <p>If the visitors had hope it lay in the fact that their opponents' minds eventually began to wander. John Terry perpetrated two weak headers in the vague direction of Petr Cech that might not be repeated over the course of this campaign and, perhaps, a few others.</p> <p>In the 61st minute Agbonlahor got to the ball ahead of the goalkeeper but Cech blocked and, when the Villa attacker then chipped a cross, John Carew was not in position to head into an unguarded net. With the match in stoppage-time, Terry was again careless but Cech was fast enough to beat Agbonlahor to the ball.</p> <p>Chelsea will mostly be scolding themselves for leniency. The openings mounted up yet they were usually squandered or dealt with by Friedel. Exasperation would have been stifled in the home support since they were having too much fun soaking up the imagination and movement of their team.</p> <p>The suspected fragility of Chelsea was an illusion. With Carvalho absent and his deputy Alex also unfit, Scolari was forced to turn to Branislav Ivanovic. Although he cost \u00a39m from Lokomotiv Moscow in January, this was the Serb's debut in the Premier League. Any regrets will lie in the lack of situations where he could show his prowess.</p> <p>Scolari, in some respects, experienced concern. Anelka has a leg injury yet he was involved heavily before being taken off at half-time. The introduction of the Argentinian Franco Di Santo simply granted the teenager the prospect of furthering his development in a stress-free environment. Chelsea are also savouring a little luck. Anelka and, for that matter, Joe Cole will get over their knocks on their countries' time. Scolari's side are not in action again until they go to the Riverside on October 18. Middlesbrough have the verve and youth to be dangerous, but the outcome is of less interest than the fact that Chelsea might confirm that they are now entertainers.</p> <p>It would be unjust not to say that there were sparkling moments under Jose Mourinho but many were in the autumn of 2004 when Arjen Robben was at peak fitness. Gradually it was the manager's pragmatism and strategic intelligence which came to the fore. The club can be grateful for trophies that were the fruit of that.</p> <p>Scolari, with his authority, is Mourinho's true successor, after the interregnum of Avram Grant, and that period of relative failure works to his advantage. This is a new start as Chelsea, by different means, strive to regain the Premier League title. Sir Alex Ferguson was correct in his observation that there is a seasoned squad at Stamford Bridge. In common with the rest of us, the Manchester United manager erred solely in his assumption that Scolari could not rejuvenate their minds.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match:</strong> Ashley Cole</p> <p>The full-backs are now an important source of dynamism for Chelsea and Cole is revelling in the freedom he enjoys</p> <p>Best moment The determined run which ended with a meticulous cutback that paved a way for Nicolas Anelka to score Chelsea's second goal</p>",

  "<p>The EU's ambitious plans to mount a collective response to the global financial crisis were in tatters tonight after the German government said it would guarantee all private savings in a move to prevent panic withdrawals - just a day after slamming the Irish for doing the same.</p> <p>Chancellor Angela Merkel said in Berlin: \"We're saying to savers that their deposits are secure.\" Peet Steinbrueck, finance minister, added: \"I'd like to stress that we'll make sure that no German saver should fear losing a euro of their deposits.\"</p> <p>Their comments came just hours after it emerged that the EU is forcing Ireland to substantially change its plans to offer all savers and businesses an unlimited guarantee on their bank deposits.</p> <p>Neelie Kroes, EU competition commissioner, said the Irish scheme, adopted without consulting either Brussels or other European governments, was discriminatory and would be modified. \"A guarantee without limits is not allowed,\" she told Dutch TV.</p> <p>The EU's top four leaders, including Merkel, had slapped down Dublin's go-it-alone approach at an emergency summit yesterday after the European commission had earlier forced Greece to row back on a similar plan to provide limitless guarantees for bank deposits.</p> <p>The EC will soon propose new laws to lift the EU-wide minimum guarantee from the current \u20ac20,000 and ensure speedier payout if banks become insolvent. But Merkel is jumping ahead, pledging that the German scheme - which relies on high street banks to pay out above the minimum - will now be wholly state-guaranteed.</p> <p>Merkel also promised today that the German government was working hard to save the troubled Hypo Real Estate bank, Germany's second biggest commercial property lender. A multi-billion euro rescue plan to keep the real-estate giant afloat failed last night and efforts were continuing to try to create a new plan. \"We will not allow the distress of one financial institution to distress the entire system,\" Merkel told reporters. \"For that reason, we are working hard to secure Hypo Real Estate.\"</p> <p>Yesterday Gordon Brown, Merkel, Italy's Silvio Berlusconi and host Nicolas Sarkozy, French president, called for a new global financial system and an end to \"speculative\" capitalism, while Peter Mandelson, incoming business secretary, warned the crisis could spark a new wave of economic nationalism.</p> <p>Mandelson, EU trade commissioner for the past four years and a severe critic of the Irish and Greek schemes, said the danger was that each country could undermine a collective response by looking for a \"get out of jail free\" card.</p> <p>Yesterday, clearly aware that they could be facing the worst economic crisis since the great depression of the 1930s, the four leaders back Sarkozy's call for a global summit to draw up a new international financial system to replace the one adopted by the West at Bretton Woods in 1944. It established the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.</p> <p>The French president urged a summit of the G8 countries together with China, India, South Africa, Brazil, Mexico and Indonesia by next month at the latest.</p> <p>\"We are laying the foundations of entrepreneurial capitalism, not speculative capitalism,\" Sarkozy told journalists. \"After this crisis we will have built the pillars of a new financial world.\" He said tougher international regulation should be applied to all financial market players, including hedge funds.</p> <p>The summit effectively buried temporarily the strict 3% budget deficit limit imposed by the Maastricht treaty as EU governments are forced to bail out stricken banks with hundreds of billions of euros, putting huge strains on their budgets.</p> <p>Sarkozy's top advisor, Claude Gu\u00e9ant, said that did not mean that EU countries such as France would \"wriggle out\" of commitments towards a balanced budget by 2012. \"We are in exceptional circumstances but that does not mean France will let its deficit run away,\" he told French radio, adding that an even deeper crisis would prompt other measures.</p> <p>In Britain, the chancellor, Alistair Darling, said today that he was ready to offer further assistance to individual banks at risk from the credit crunch. He declined to name any banks that may be under threat but said the Treasury was monitoring the situation; he said it was important to take general action as well as assisting individual banks. </p> <p>\"That's why, through the Bank of England, we have put billions of pounds into the system to help the whole banking sector, he told BBC1's Andrew Marr show. \"But also you do need to be ready to take specific action - as we did with Bradford &amp; Bingley last weekend, as we did with Northern Rock.\"<br> The UK's chancellor said the government was prepared to take \"pretty big steps that we wouldn't take in ordinary times\" to ensure that Britain gets through the current crisis.</p> <p>But he said he would resist pressure to scrap the Bank of England's target of keeping inflation within a percentage point of 2%, which has been criticised for obstructing potential reductions in interest rates that could stave off a recession.</p> <p>He also indicated that he was ready to let state borrowing rise higher rather than increase taxes.</p> <p>Darling said it was \"always important\" to keep inflation under control and that the government would \"allow borrowing to rise as the economy slows down. That is the right thing to do - you support it, you don't start taking money out of it.\"</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea\">Chelsea</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool\">Liverpool</a> remain together at the top of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague\">Premier League</a> after respective wins over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/astonvilla\">Aston Villa</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity\">Manchester City</a>, while <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/tottenhamhotspur\">Tottenham</a>'s misery continues following a 1-0 defeat at home to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/hullcity\">Hull</a>.</p> <p>Chelsea were good value for their 2-0 win as they dominated in-form Aston Villa, who were fortunate not to lose by a greater margin. Joe Cole broke the deadlock after 21 minutes, finishing off a sweeping move that began when Villa ceded possession carelessly. Florent Malouda found Frank Lampard and Cole fired a powerful shot past Brad Friedel. The Blues doubled their advantage a minute before half time after Friedel, who was excellent throughout, made a superb stop from Michael Ballack and Nicolas Anelka followed up. The home side had several chances to extend their lead after the break but Villa's defence, and Friedel in particular, somehow kept the rampant Blues at bay.</p> <p>\"I am satisfied because we played very well,\" the Chelsea manager, Luis Felipe Scolari, said afterwards. \"For me it is the most important game this season because if we won we were in first position in the league and now we have 10 days to recuperate our players through the international break. After, when we start the league, all our players will be in good condition.\"</p> <p>Scolari also sought to assuage fears over the fitness of Joe Cole and John Terry ahead of England's World Cup qualifiers this week. Both men suffered injuries during the game but their manager predicted they would be ready for the matches against Kazakhstan and Belarus. ''[Cole] got a little touch, it's nothing, a little problem on the foot. In two or three days with the national team he will be in the condition to play. John Terry is the same. He is a fantastic man, if he feels something he still wants to play.\"</p> <p>Liverpool, meanwhile, looked certain to lose touch with Luiz Felipe Scolari's side after finding themselves 2-0 down at half-time at Manchester City but a remarkable second-half revival earned Rafa Ben\u00edtez's men a dramatic comeback win. Alvaro Arbeloa was at fault for the first goal as he failed to deal with Shaun Wright-Phillips's cross, enabling Stephen Ireland to rifle a shot into the roof of the net after 20 minutes and, four minutes before half-time, Javier Garrido unleashed a spectacular free-kick into the top left-hand corner to double City's lead.</p> <p>However, 10 minutes after the restart Fernando Torres gave the visitors a lifeline, scoring the Reds' 1000th Premier League goal, and, after Pablo Zabaleta was sent off for a professional foul, Torres again beat Joe Hart to earn his side a 77th-minute equaliser. The Spaniard could have had a hat-trick as Liverpool poured forward late on, but the last-gasp winner fell to Dirk Kuyt, who swept in from close range in the dying seconds.</p> <p>Geovanni was again the hero of the hour for Hull as his free-kick condemned Tottenham to their fifth Premier League defeat of the season at White Hart Lane. The Brazilian helped Phil Brown's men shock Arsenal last weekend and his curling effort after just nine minutes was enough to leave struggling Spurs, for whom Luka Modric missed two excellent second-half chances, rock bottom.</p> <p>Peter Crouch and Jermain Defoe scored in the 2-0 defeat of Tottenham last weekend and both strikers were on target again at Fratton Park, scoring either side of Ricardo Fuller's 48th-minute equaliser to give <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/portsmouth\">Portsmouth</a> a 2-1 victory against <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/stokecity\">Stoke</a>. Crouch's overhead kick on 25 minutes was the pick of the goals while Defoe's 51st-minute strike, shortly after he had hit the post, takes him joint top of the scorers' charts on five goals.</p> <p>In the late kick-off <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/newcastleunited\">Newcastle</a> staged a spirited recovery at Goodison Park, rallying from two goals down to earn a valuable point at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/everton\">Everton</a>. Mikel Arteta gave the hosts an 18th-minute lead from the penalty spot after Nicky Butt had brought down Leighton Baines and Marouane Fellaini made it 2-0 on 35 minutes. However, Steven Taylor and Damien Duff struck a minute either side of half-time to bring Newcastle back into the game. </p> <p>The Magpies almost won the match with 12 minutes left only for Baines to scramble Charles N'Zogbia's shot off the line, while in the last four minutes Everton themselves twice came close to snatching a first home win of the season through Victor Anichebe. However, the match ended level and Newcastle leapfrog Stoke to move up to 17th place, three clear of Spurs.</p> <p>Earlier in the day, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/westhamunited\">West Ham</a> missed out on the chance to go take a provisional divisional lead as they were beaten 3-1 at home to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/boltonwanderers\">Bolton</a>. The home side had the better of the first half-hour's play before Robert Green fumbled Jlloyd Samuel's long ball into the path of Kevin Davies, who lifted the ball into the empty net. Gary Cahill doubled the Trotters' lead from close range four minutes later and although Carlton Cole reduced the arrears on 69 minutes, Matthew Taylor finished off Gianfranco Zola's side with a swerving long-range free-kick with three minutes to go to secure Bolton's first win since the opening day of the season.</p>",
  "<p>Financial excess is an old theme of literature. Shakespeare dealt with it in The Merchant of Venice, and it evencrops up in The Canterbury Tales. Trollope's The Way We Live Now, featuring the fraudulent financier Augustus Melmotte, is perhaps the most famous 19th-century dissection of corruption and greed, while the capitalist frenzy that gripped early 20th-century America was chronicled by, among others, Upton Sinclair and Theodore Dreiser. More recently, Eighties excess was immortalised in several big, testosterone-fuelled novels, most notably Tom Wolfe's The Bonfire of the Vanities, Jay McInnerny's Brightness Falls and Martin Amis's Money.</p> <p>It seems odd, then, that the financial haymaking that has been going on in recent times has largely escaped the attention of writers. The wealth accumulation of the past few years has been considerably more spectacular than that of any previous era, yet the 21st-century Masters of the Universe have remained stubbornly absent from fiction. There have been no memorable portrayals of oligarchs or hedge fund managers, no bracing satires set in the world of private equity. That other big topic of our age, the War on Terror, has had its share of chroniclers, but the misdeeds of financiers have \u2013 so far \u2013 been overlooked.</p> <p>This absence is not confined to novels. The last famous film about banking was Wall Street, with Michael Douglas playing Gordon ('Greed is good') Gecko \u2013 and that was in 1987. Television drama has taken us behind the scenes of professions from lawyers and doctors to teachers and politicos, but there has been no This Life for bankers, no ER of the hedge fund world. Theatre has become much more politically engaged, taking on all manner of high level corruption and malfeasance, but though it has exposed the rottenness o Westminster, it has not dealt with the rottenness of the Square Mile.</p> <p>What accounts for this? The most obvious answer is that modern finance is so mind-bogglingly complex that few writers feel equipped to tackle it. What lawyers and doctors get up to is broadly known and has a basic drama we can all relate to. (Will the criminal be convicted? Will the patient live?) But few of us can understand, let alone sympathise with, the issues that cause bankers to break out in sweats. The drama surrounding a fine adjustment in the value of a derivative, or a 10-point fall in the Dow Jones, is not something that can be easily captured on the page.</p> <p>Yet although the minutiae of bankers' working lives have become unapproachably obscure, what they get up to in their leisure time should be, from a novelist's point of view, entirely accessible The lives of the super-rich are not sealed off from view; they are part of the spectacle of our times, the cultural fabric of life in the early 21st century. We know about the \u00a330,000 lunches at Mayfair restaurants, the millions spent on Warhols and Hirsts at auction. We know about the private jets, the villas, the trips to Spearmint Rhino. People are immensely curious about these things, as is demonstrated by the success of banking memoirs, from Liar's Poker to City Boy. If nothing else, it shows a depressing lack of commercial enterprise on the part of our novelists that so few of them have attempted to capitalise on this interest.</p> <p>No doubt part of the problem is that, in Britain, there is a long-standing aversion to writing about business. More than a century ago, Henry James decreed that novels should focus on private life and the emotions, not politics and business; most writers since have taken him at his word. With a few honourable exceptions, such as David Lodge in Nice Work and Julian Barnes in England, England, contemporary British writers have steered clear of business. This is not a problem that has afflicted their American counterparts.</p> <p>Perhaps because US writers are generally more ambitious, and also because US culture is less sniffy about moneymaking, modern American novelists seem at home in the worlds of work and money in a way that few British onesdo. Think of Saul Bellow's comi-tragic portrait of errant market speculation in Seize the Day, or Philip Roth's account of factory life in American Pastoral. Or think of David Foster Wallace's sinister vision of a corporatised America of the future in his 1996 epic Infinite Jest.</p> <p>We should not be surprised, then, that it is an American writer who has been most prescient about the current financial upheavals. In his slim 2003 novel Cosmopolis, Don DeLillo tracked the life of an enormously wealthy currency trader on a day of global financial meltdown. It is by no means DeLillo's best work, but many things about it that now seem prophetic \u2013 the way, for instance, he captures the trader's overweening ambition and arrogance, and how he evokes the sense of a system that no one fully understands spinning rapidly out of control. These are hugely rich themes for a novelist \u2013 think of what Kafka, or even Dickens, would have done with them \u2013 and they are certainly deserving of further literary outings. Perhaps one of the many bankers now with time on their hands will manage to do them justice.</p> <p>\u2022 William Skidelsky is books editor of the Observer</p>",
  "<p>At an <a href=\"http://www.lecturelist.org/content/view_lecture/5742\">Economist debate</a> last week on political cartooning, and how \"the art of satire shapes the political landscape\", it dawned on me that satirists face a monumental problem today. So deep-rooted is our disdain for politicians that the satirists who mock them \u2013 depicting them as dumb monkeys or with their underpants pulled up over their trousers \u2013 are really only massaging our prejudices, stroking our cynicism, rather than challenging us to think about the world differently. Alexander Pope said satirists should \"without sneering teach the rest to sneer\". Today, in our era of sneering, satire risks becoming a self-congratulatory, back-patting display of shared public cynicism.</p> <p>There was some pretty good satire on display during the debate. The speakers \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.kaltoons.com/\">Kevin \"KAL\" Kallaugher</a>, who has been the Economist's political cartoonist for 30 years, and Henry Naylor, creator of ITV's animated satire series <a href=\"http://www.bebo.com/Profile.jsp?MemberId=6299983222\">Talking Heads</a> \u2013 showed some decent stuff. I particularly liked Naylor's skit on Gordon Brown, depicted as a dour and Dickensian bookkeeping figure, trying to organise a celebrity party at No 10, only to be gatecrashed by Amy Winehouse and Pete Doherty who tattooed the word \"knob\" on his forehead. Yet this induced a curious noise in the audience: a kind of knowing laughter, more of a murmur of agreement than a startled guffaw. The best satire once made us rethink things, or at least made us gasp; now it makes us think: \"Yeah you're right, they're all twats.\"<br> So much political comedy these days upholds the cynical and even mainstream view rather than challenging it. It will be a nippy day in hell before anyone is surprised by something Rory Bremner says. His routine (\"routine\" being the operative word) reads like a list of the petty prejudices passed around the dinner party circuit of London N1. Used to love Tony Blair but now hates him: check. Thinks there should be a legal inquiry into Iraq: check. Reckons all politicians are liars and connivers: check. <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre/reviews/little-britain-live-guildhall-portsmouth-512469.html\">David Walliams' explanation</a> for why he depicts so many grotesque people in Little Britain \u2013 incontinent old women, thick ugly chavs, etc \u2013 could have come straight from an internal Islington council memo: \"We don't stereotype. We celebrate difference.\"</p> <p>Marcus Brigstocke does stand-up routines on how global warming sceptics are evil and deluded, which, seriously, at a time when sceptics are publicly branded as \"deniers\" and serious commentators say they should be denied air-time, is about as fresh or challenging as making a joke about Thatch. What next, a comedy routine on how awful paedophiles are? As <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/radio/2008/06/marcus-brigstocke-quirke-funny\">Antonia Quirke said recently in the New Statesman</a>, Brigstocke, like so many other political comics and satirists of our time, \"just assumes the audience will be complicit in the utterly bog-standard, unsurprising bit of wafty liberal observation that is coming out of his mouth\".<br> Brigstocke also shows how prejudicial this cheap, self-congratulatory \"political comedy\" can be. Again massaging the prejudices of liberal England, he does a stand-up routine on how untrustworthy and generally fecal working-class builders are. They overcharge you, never smile, drink \"eight gallons of tea every five minutes\" and leave \"a turd in your loo so big that the only way you can flush it down is by breaking it up with a fucking stick\", he says. Mocking the lower classes while an audience of middle-class Radio 4 listeners laughs heartily along? Brigstocke truly is the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jun/19/surplusmanning\">Bernard Manning</a> of the liberal set.<br> Sometimes today, political comedy and satire are so drippingly cynical that they end up spreading backward ideas rather than enlightening us. Private Eye is still home to some of Britain's most cutting satire, yet it also shows what can happen when healthy scepticism becomes relentless cynicism. For years, Private Eye published bizarre article after bizarre article on the alleged harms of the MMR vaccine, presumably because it thinks that if the government says something is safe, then it mustn't be. Politicians say black; we say white. From \"bravely\" attacking global warming deniers to mocking/celebrating the lower classes to spreading irrational fears about medicine \u2026 our political comics have become the mouthpieces for an utterly non-progressive political cynicism. Even worse, sometimes they're just not funny.</p> <p>Of course, there are still good satirists out there. Chris Morris, perhaps recognising that parliamentary politics is now beyond satire, has turned to satirising the increasingly pompous media or the politics of fear. Online magazines like The Onion and the Daily Mash hit a nerve. Yet there are still vast swathes of mainstream authority that our \"brave\" satirists leave untouched \u2013 environmentalism, for example. The green outlook, with its censorious, misanthropic streak and its fabulously hypocritical adherents, is ripe for the bullet of satire. So where is it? In an attempt to ignite it (warning: shameless plug ahead) my new satire on environmentalism is published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton this month. <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/dominic-lawson/dominic-lawson-some-hints-for-saving-the-world-935308.html\">The Independent says it is \"richly comic\"</a>.

  "<p>Chinese writers and literary critics feel misunderstood, that much is clear. Why is more Chinese literature not being translated and \u2013 perhaps even more importantly \u2013 widely read? After all, <a href=\"http://www.isabelallende.com/\">Isabel Allende</a> and <a href=\"http://www.umbertoeco.com/\">Umberto Eco</a> are hugely popular in translation.</p> <p>I am a translator, currently in China researching contemporary literature. I have been talking to writers and academics about their favourite works and what, for them, makes good literature. The kind of answers they give me are illuminating, in particular because of the position from which they make these judgments. </p> <p>In the 1950s and 60s, creative writing in China was obliged to serve politics. Han Dong, in his recent novel <a href=\"http://paper-republic.org/books/banished/\">Banished!</a>, observes mordantly that this was a \"system [which] was tightly meshed together, a seamless whole. A dog that winds up biting its own tail.\" Today the debate is still heavily politicised, albeit it in a different way. The \"reform and opening-up\" of the 1980s has led to \"marketisation\" in every aspect of Chinese life; books now have to make money. So the <a href=\"http://english.cpc.people.com.cn/\">Chinese Communist party</a>, which is entirely in favour of marketisation, likes books which shed a positive light on urbanisation and the growth of a consumerist society. At the same time, a nod also has to be made to its own leadership. The forthcoming publication of the \"300 Most Influential Books of the 30 years of the Reform and Opening-up of China\" was press-released as follows: </p> <blockquote> <p>These 300 books \u2026 fully reflect the deep changes that Chinese society and the Chinese people have gone through over the past 30 years under the leadership of the Chinese Communist party \u2026 The books will provide healthy guidance to thought and morality, [and] have positive, uplifting content \u2026 </p> </blockquote> <p>(Translated and quoted <a href=\"http://paper-republic.org/ericabrahamsen/30-years-of-literature/#comments\">here</a>). </p> <p>True, as all my Chinese colleagues tell me, no one takes this stuff seriously, but it shows how writers have to acknowledge the prevailing ideology, whether or not they choose to confront it directly. There are economic pressures too: writers of politically acceptable books can win lucrative prizes. And the need to earn a decent living is real. </p> <p>Back to the question, how do Chinese writers and critics evaluate creative writing today? Here is a framework of analysis which has been given to me by half a dozen critics/writers: at one end of the spectrum is \"officially-approved\" literature, (the \"positive\" and \"uplifting\" sort); at the other, \"good\", end of the spectrum is <em>minjian</em> (people/folk writing). This means writing about the lives and characters of ordinary people, while rejecting any ideological standpoint. (Note that \"people\" here means something quite different from \"the people\", as in the slogan \"Serve the People\").</p> <p>If this analysis sounds alien, then how about this contemporary example from the US offered to me by a Chinese woman writer friend? She observed the furore that surrounded the publication of the Da Vinci Code \u2013 and said that denunciations of the book from church pulpits reminded her irresistibly of the mass criticisms of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution\">Cultural Revolution</a>, suggesting that ideological differences notwithstanding, America and China share an ideological \"climate\".</p> <p>Another element in the equation is the pressure to write for the mass market. Arguments rage as to whether the market has a baleful influence on creative writing. Most think it does, though they admit that literary giants such as <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1082286/Mo-Yan\">Mo Yan</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jia_Pingwa\">Jia Pingwa</a> manage to write splendid, influential books which are also best-sellers.</p> <p>Finally, censorship: there is much less of it than is generally believed, but it is still a real preoccupation. Some writers admit to self-censorship, for instance <a href=\"http://paper-republic.org/authors/yan-lianke/\">Yan Lianke</a> whose novel, Dream of Ding Village, about the Aids epidemic among peasants who sell their blood, is due out in translation next year. Yan has said that he \"attempted to forestall a ban by doing the censors\" work for them. Out went the novel's most ambitious features: the blood pipeline, the global trade angle and direct criticism of national politics. His novel was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/oct/09/books.china\">banned anyway</a>. </p> <p>However, China being China, the situation is more grey than black-and-white. Ha Jin wrote in <a href=\"http://www.theamericanscholar.org/\">the American Scholar</a> in August 2008 that: \"Among [recently] banned titles was Zhang [Yihe]'s book Past Stories of Peking Opera Stars, which describes the vicissitudes of eight master opera singers, especially their sufferings and ruination after 1949.\" Coincidentally, as I read those words, I was sitting in a house in Shanghai with a copy of that very book which my landlord, a respectable accountant, had just lent me. In other words, banned books are sometimes readily available.</p> <p>A preoccupation with officially-approved or \"people\"-based literature, censorship and marketisation, makes the Chinese literary world sound introspective, but this is not entirely true. Chinese writers have been much influenced by authors such as <a href=\"http://kirjasto.sci.fi/jlborges.htm\">Luis Borges</a> and <a href=\"http://www.themodernword.com/gabo/\">Gabriel Garcia Marquez</a>, <a href=\"http://www.kundera.de/english/\">Milan Kundera</a> and <a href=\"http://www.orhanpamuk.net/\">Orhan Pamuk</a>. Unfortunately, the process does not yet seem to work the other way round. </p> <p>Given the pessimism of some of the above comments, one has to ask if it is possible to bridge the cultural divide and bring more Chinese literature to a British readership. Of course, I believe it is, otherwise I would not be a translator. </p> <p>But there is also a need for British publishers to understand Chinese fiction better. That boring old label \"banned in China\" actually means only one thing: that the book ticked one of the censor's no-no boxes. Sex and violence will not sell a book if it is badly written, as many are. Some publishers say they want a personable, articulate author, preferably one who can speak English. There are only a few writers who provide that winning combination and there are many who write great stuff but are not young, glamorous or English-speaking. </p> <p>To be fair to publishers, there is a huge language barrier: they are dependent on Chinese-speaking readers and translators if they cannot read the texts themselves. (Though if I hear one more publisher whinge that they \"cannot find the translators\", I shall probably scream.) There is now, however, a website providing much-needed information for publishers, translators and Chinese writers: <a href=\"http://www.paper-republic.org\">Paper Republic</a>.</p> <p>Of course, some publishers are both brave and imaginative: Penguin was prepared to break the mould with Wolf Totem, a novel about Mongolian herders and their relationship with wolves. </p> <p>To finish, here are a few of my personal favourites, chosen simply to show a little of the rich variety of reading which is out there. </p> <p><a href=\"http://paper-republic.org/books/banished/\">Banished!</a> by Han Dong, a lyrical, sometimes painful account of a boy growing up during the cultural revolution. Hawaii University Press, 2009.</p> <p>Lust, Caution, And Other Stories, by Eileen Chang (Chinese name, Zhang Ailing). Penguin Modern Classics, 2007. There are also other volumes of her brilliant short stories and novellas available in translation. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/08/jiapingwa\">Happy</a>, by Jia Pingwa. This novel is narrated entirely in the first person, by a Charlie Chaplin-esque migrant worker in Xi'an, who is alternately funny, pompous, touching and foul-mouthed \u2013 but never boring. Not in translation, but an excerpt appears in Guardian Books.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/sep/22/original.writing.china.reflected.zhu.wen\">Collecting</a>, an essay by Zhu Wen, which also appears in Guardian Books. Written after a short visit to the UK (his first), his essay is not just witty and acerbic, it is humblingly observant.</p>",
  "<p>Picture the scene. Mere minutes after the Pittsburgh Penguins beat the Ottawa Senators with a gorgeous goal inside the final 60 seconds of overtime, you find yourself in the Pennsylvanian team's dressing room. You're not alone, the place is busy with journalists and exhausted hockey players. A sign bearing the name of each skater has been positioned above each individual stall. With most of the attention focused on one Sidney Crosby \u2013 a big splash around this league \u2013 you realise that you are the only person staring at a sign that reads, \"Pittsburgh Penguins: Satan\". This is the coolest thing you've ever seen, and it would be the easiest thing to steal.</p> <p>What do you do?</p> <p>Since I didn't swipe the identification plate of one Miroslav Satan (it's pronounced Shertan, disappointingly) all I will bring home from Sweden are memories. And while it is neither my natural disposition, nor indeed my job, to look on the bright side, I am honour bound to say this: the National Hockey League's second excursion into Europe has been a peach.</p> <p>Last year the league brought its bandwagon to London, starting the 82-game regular season with two fixtures between the Los Angeles Kings and the Anaheim Ducks (whom I liked a great deal more when they were known as the Mighty Ducks) at the 02 Arena. I can still vividly recall the thrill I felt that these two teams were visiting my adopted home city. Even so, the part of me that I would sometimes like to keep quiet knew that the league's first overseas adventure was only a partial success. The teams were an odd choice, the games were not classics, the atmosphere was stilted. It wouldn't be true to say that hockey is to England what cricket is to Canada, but it wouldn't be entirely untrue either.</p> <p>For the start of the 2008 campaign, the NHL has taken more care. With two games in Prague (where yesterday the New York Rangers beat the Tampa Bay Lightning by two goals to one) and two here in Stockholm (Pens and Sens, the latter captained by Swede Daniel Alfredsson) the world's best league took one of the world's best sports to two countries that understand and care about 'the on-ice product'. For the National Hockey League, this is a product which they're hoping to sell; their spokesman doesn't need much prompting before he's turning on the marketing speak, making it clear in the slickest possible way that this enterprise is about brand awareness and global positioning.</p> <p>This it may well be, but here's the thing: no amount of corporate business plans and entrepreneurial buzzwords can obscure the fact that last night in Stockholm's fabulously upholstered Globe Arena, 14,119 people saw a game that is part of their national culture played at a level that most here will only have seen on television. And as you know, hockey on TV is not really hockey at all. How can it be? You can't even see the puck.</p> <p>Sweden does have a league of its own, and a very good one at that. The Elite League (Elitserien) is one of Europe's strongest, and many players have progressed from its ranks up to the NHL. The key word here, though, is 'up'; the Elite is good, but the National Hockey League is great. Not for nothing is it known in the trade as 'The Show'. Tonight in Stockholm 'The Show' came to town, for two nights only. Not only that, but it came in the form of two teams that in eight months' time might both feasibly, even realistically, challenge for the Stanley Cup.</p> <p>The games matter, too - this is the season, this is it. Bounding from the bench like rodeo bulls, for the first 10 minutes the Penguins looked like the kind of team who might not concede a goal all season. Playing firewagon hockey of a kind where even the firewagon is on fire, for almost an entire period it seemed as if the puck never left the Senator's sensitive areas. Shots flew about the place, as did fully grown men \u2013 at 30 miles an hour. Pittsburgh began their season by dishing out the kind of battering that Detroit visited upon them in the first two games of last season's Stanley Cup Finals. Basically, they learned a lesson and used it to pick on Canada.</p> <p>I would at this point like to tell you who did what, but if I struggled to take it all in as it happened I'm on black ice when it comes to remembering it now. Last season I found myself in the press box of the Prudential Center in Newark, as the New Jersey Devils faced the New York Rangers in the first round of the play-offs. Four stories above the ice, next to me sat a radio commentator who described the action below as fluently as if he were reading a bedtime story to an attentive child. Me, I would have described the game thus: \"Er, Rangers, Rangers, De\u2026, no, yeah, Devils, Devils, referee, er, goalie\u2026 hang on, hang on, er\u2026\" At one point the man turned to me and asked, \"That was Shanahan that just scored, right?\" And I answered, \"Yeah, let's go with that.\"</p> <p>I can't say with any certainty that the puckheads of Stockholm were able to deconstruct the minutiae of this frantic and fabulous game any better than I, but I do know for sure that what they were seeing was for them something special. From the moment former Maple Leaf and local demigod Mats Sundin dropped the ceremonial puck, to the moment the game ended, 14,000 faces proved that a love of a game and an exercise in international marketing are not mutually exclusive concepts. Whatever the NHL's intentions, the truth is that they brought to Sweden something people desperately wanted to see.</p> <p>Actually, no, that's not quite correct. The majority of people within an arena that looks like a giant bonbon wanted to see a victory for the Ottawa Senators, a victory for their Swedish captain. Midway through the first period I predicted the evening would end with the Canadian team in therapy. But this didn't last, and the Sens rallied, prospered and entered overtime with the scores tied at three goals apiece. But with less than 60 seconds of the five-minute fourth period remaining, Tyler Kennedy pounced on Jason Spezza's errant pass and blasted home. Game over.</p> <p>Only the game has just begun. This time tomorrow the Penguins and the Senators, the Rangers and the Lightning, will be on their way home, to continue the work that started here. But while the NHL will always be North America's league, on loan to Europe for the briefest of glimpses, tonight proved that hockey also has a home on the continent to the east. The great players may work abroad, but their audience is everywhere. </p> <p>Postscript: The morning after the night before, on my way to breakfast I cursed silently as the lift stopped before it reached the lobby. In walked a tall gentleman with a weak chin. I know him, I thought. It's, it's \u2026 Mario Lemieux! And do you know what I said to him? Nothing. I just looked at my feet. </p> <p><em>Tune into NASN (Sky Channel 417 &amp; Virgin Channel 533) for the most comprehensive coverage of the NHL season including the All-Star game, Play-offs and the Stanley Cup.

  "<p>I have been attending party political conferences for 24 years, but never in the belief that they had the capacity to move public opinion in any significant way. That all changed last year with a spectacular lurch from boom to bust as Gordon Brown seemed to build an election winning poll lead one week only to have it snatched away by David Cameron the next. This year has been nothing like as dramatic, but there is nevertheless a sense that something has changed and that the assumptions of a fortnight ago are no longer valid.</p> <p>Of course, this hasn't happened in a bubble. It is events in the outside world in the form of a major financial crisis that have made it possible. What the coincidence of the conference season has done is to magnifying the political impact of the global economic turmoil. <a href=\"http://www.labour.org.uk/gordon_brown_conference\">Brown</a> started his conference week with many people wondering whether he would survive what had by then become an open campaign to depose him as Labour leader. By the end, he had recovered at least some of the passion and purpose that has been so conspicuously missing over the last year. The question that has plagued him for most of that period \u2013 \"what is Brown for?\" \u2013 now has a plausible answer. His age, his seriousness and his reputation as a bit of an egghead now seem less of a problem.</p> <p>The crisis has had the opposite effect on the Conservatives, making their conference a much more subdued and uncertain event than anyone expected. As one party pollster put it to me, they are waiting nervously to find out whether this will prove to be a \"game changing\" event. This explains the sober atmosphere around the conference hall and the slightly downbeat tone of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2008/oct/02/cameron.analysis\">David Cameron's speech</a>. It also explains some subtle repositioning designed to put distance between the Conservatives and the free market orthodoxy with which they have become associated. In talking about \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/30/georgeosborne.economy\">casino capitalism</a>\", George Osborne was consciously adopting the left's language of moral disapproval. The awkwardness was hard to disguise.</p> <p>How all of this affects the outcome of an election that won't take place for a year and a half is impossible to predict. If the game has changed, we don't know what the new rules are. This is certainly not a good time to be a party philosophically opposed to the idea of an active state. In the last fortnight it has been the only thing standing in the way of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/16/economics.creditcrunch\">complete financial meltdown</a> and a new depression. Yet the crisis phase of this downturn will eventually pass, and it will do so even as the economic circumstances of the electorate continue to worsen. If the country goes to the polls with 3 million unemployed, as some predict, it is hard to see Labour securing a fourth term. Brown needs his run of luck to continue.</p> <p>One thing that did become clear in the conference season is that the Conservative Party is once again a formidable political machine attracting broad and enthusiastic support. When I last went to a Conservative conference six years ago in Bournemouth, my lasting impression was of a party dominated by the old and the weird; a retirement home for eccentrics and fanatics. It looked entirely likely that it might just die out. That oddball element still exists (greeting delegates in Birmingham this week was a man dressed as John Bull, complete with Union Jack waistcoat, demanding \"time for a change\"). But the old and the weird have now been diluted by the young and the enthusiastic who formed a large and visible contingent of conference goers. </p> <p>At the party of the <a href=\"http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/\">Policy Exchange</a> think tank on Tuesday I was reminded very much of similar events I attended at Labour conferences a decade ago or more. There was the same mood of expectation and self-belief that preceded Labour's first landslide. Some might complain (not always fairly) that such people are youthful careerists willing to attach themselves to any coming party. But the dedicated followers of fashion at least know success when they see it, so their presence is indicative of something important. You can learn a lot about a political party by watching it at play and the lesson I learned this week is that the Conservatives think their time has arrived. Whatever the game now is, that is a precious advantage.</p>",
  "<p>It is astonishing how quickly governments can find money to make amends for the folly of rich men. Over \u20ac17bn seemed to appear magically out of the fog that enveloped Belgium this week to prevent two of the country's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/30/banking.europeanbanks\">banks from imploding</a> in a global crisis brought on by feckless speculation.</p> <p>As Europe's press woke up to how contagious the malady affecting Wall Street is, a more disturbing announcement in Brussels was largely ignored because it did not excite a testosterone-powered elite. A new UN-backed <a href=\"http://www.euroresources.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Euromapping/Euromapping_2008_pocket_guide.pdf\">report</a> revealed that aid from the industrialised world for family planning services in poor countries fell by nearly 8% last year. </p> <p>Of the eight millennium development goals agreed by the UN's member states in 2000, the <a href=\"http://www.mdgmonitor.org/goal5.cfm\">objective</a> that has seen least progress is the one that affects women most directly. It promises universal access to contraception and other family planning services by 2015, as well as to reduce the maternal mortality rate by three-quarters. Between 2000 and 2005, the proportion of women in poor countries who died during childbirth in poor countries dropped from 430 to 400 for every 100,000 live births \u2013 a mere 5% reduction. No progress was registered in sub-Saharan Africa. </p> <p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.who.int/making_pregnancy_safer/events/2008/mdg5/mdg5_lr.pdf\">World Health Organisation</a>, these goals could be met if rich nations stump up an additional \u20ac13bn in aid. Refusing to bridge the deficit condemns 500,000 women to die each year from complications that in most cases could be overcome if they had access to proper care. </p> <p>In the past, the EU has displayed some gutsy leadership in this field. When the Bush administration decided six years ago to suspend its contributions to UN agencies it suspected of encouraging abortion, the European commission <a href=\"http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/0724-01.htm\">undertook to fund the shortfall.</a> The commission has also <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3843797.stm\">denounced the Vatican's efforts</a> to dissuade the poor from using condoms. </p> <p>But the EU's approach towards family planning is not sufficiently comprehensive. Most of Europe's aid related to sexual and reproductive health is directed towards Aids. This concentration on a disease that is imperilling Africa's development can only be applauded but unfortunately it has meant that other family planning services are being neglected.</p> <p>If some members of the European parliament had their way, the EU would abandon its support for family planning. When this topic was debated during September, right-leaning deputies, including many British Conservatives, voted against a <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P6-TA-2008-0406+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN&amp;language=EN\">motion exhorting extra aid</a> because it contained references to abortion. </p> <p>The reality is that the millennium goals won't be attained either in 2015 or for decades after that unless abortion services are made available. About 18 million unsafe abortions are carried out each year, resulting in the deaths of 70,000 women. Banning abortion or reducing access to it will simply cause more deaths, as has been proven in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/journalismcompetition/abortion.in.nicaragua\">Nicaragua</a> where the government turned terminating a pregnancy, even in cases where a mother's life is at risk, into a criminal offence in 2006.</p> <p>There is a good way of keeping abortion to a minimum. This would involve a dramatic scaling up of contraception in order to reduce unplanned pregnancies, while simultaneously offering advice on all areas of family planning. All this can be done for less than the price of bailing out a single bank.</p>"
