  "<h2>Profile</h2> <p>You don't have to have use expensive silicon to make an effective solar cell. German company Odersun makes thin-film solar cells based on copper, indium, and sulphur using a worldwide patented process. Though not as energy efficient as silicon, it's cheaper and can be formed into virtually any size or power. </p> <p>The company was founded in 2002 to commercialise some private scientific research started in 1994, manufacturing a copper-indium-disulphide semiconductor on long reels of copper tape - 1 cm wide and 0.1mm thick. \"It's a very long and flexible solar cell that can be cut into strips and then overlapped onto surfaces of basically any size,\" says corporate communications manager Korinna Penndorf.</p> <p>Recently, Odersun provided thin-film solar modules for the Olympic Park in Beijing. To make the trapezoid roof shapes, the solar cell material was glued into \"supercells\", with the length of the cut strips determining the current. The number of cells connected in series - packaged in a flexible film or rigid glass laminate - defines the voltage. </p> <p>This \"cut and paste\" technique has a distinct advantage over more conventional silicon cells. \"It makes it possible to integrate it, especially in buildings,\" says Penndorf. </p> <p>New buildings hold a growing interest for Odersun. \"We want to be in contact with architects and designers already in the planning stage to make sure that they're regarding photovoltaic as a building component,\" adds Penndorf. \"Solar can be very cost-efficient and a real price alternative to classical building components.\" </p> <h2>In brief</h2> <p>\u00b7 Based in Frankfurt, Germany<br>\u00b7 90 employees <br>\u00b7 Founded in 2002<br>\u00b7 Product is shipping<br>\u00b7 <a href=\"http://www.odersun.de\">www.odersun.de</a></p> <h2>Explore further</h2> <p>See the whole list, plus features and comment, at<br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/cleantechnology100\">2008 Guardian/Library House CleanTech 100</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/17/cleantechnology100\">How the companies were selected</a><br>Data supplied by <a href=\"http://www.libraryhouse.net/cleantech/\">Library House</a></p>",

  "<p>Stories about climate change are generally depressing: melting ice sheets, more intense hurricanes and species vanishing as humans steadily push up the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. But out of the impending gloom has come the promise of technology to slow or even reverse some of the decline. </p> <p>In its simplest form, clean (or green) technology is anything that helps consumers or industries to use basic materials such as energy, water and waste more efficiently and, while using it, lessen their environmental footprint. Unlike IT, biotech or telecommunications, there is no agreed definition of \"cleantech\" but it is a hot area, thanks to heightened awareness of climate change and the rising cost of fossil fuels. </p> <p>And it is poised for a boom: according to the analysts Library House, venture capital investment in European cleantech companies went from \u00a3407m in 2006 to \u00a3805m last year. Ben Goldsmith of WHEB Ventures, an investment firm specialising in environmental businesses, says that globally the figures are even more impressive: \"around $850m in 2004 against $6bn in 2007\".</p> <p>Clean technology represents more of a theme than a specific sector, says Patrick Sheehan, a partner at the Environmental Technologies Fund. He says that waves of investment in the arena have come and gone for more than 20 years, and identifies the most recent as starting with investors in the US, mainly those used to dealing with technological startups in Silicon Valley, around 2004.</p> <p><strong>Changing views</strong> </p> <p>At the time, there was a debate among environmentalists on how to pitch the problem of climate change to the public. \"There was a shift from the negative \u2013 we've got to stop climate change happening and it'll be a disaster and we've got to stop flying on holiday \u2013 to the positive \u2013 we can build a whole new industry around efficiency and a low-carbon economy,\" says Goldsmith.<br>In Europe, governments were sympathetic to the green cause. </p> <p>\"Europe has a pretty rich heritage of environmental awareness and concern from Scandinavia downwards, and that's enabled legislators to begin to do something about it,\" says Sheehan. Mechanisms such as the EU's emissions trading scheme, which allows companies to trade permits to emit carbon dioxide as part of their work, have helped improve the economic viability of (generally more expensive) clean technologies.</p> <p>Also key were the globetrotting efforts of Al Gore and the highly regarded economic analysis of the impacts of a warming world by Nicholas Stern in 2006. \"In the space of the last two years, climate change has moved from the periphery to the mainstream and oil prices have become a major concern. Energy security has become a major issue and you've got, from Europe, a whole raft of legislation around these subjects,\" says Sheehan. <br>Enter the investment funds. \"There are those that see cleantech just as renewable energy,\" says Goldsmith. </p> <p>\"If you look at some of the large US west coast venture funds, who perhaps have their expertise in semiconductors and IT technologies, they can more easily move their focus to things like solar PV and the high-tech renewable energy stuff.\"</p> <p><strong>Linking the chain</strong></p> <p>Library House, in collaboration with the Carbon Trust, proposes the idea that cleantech can be divided into four parts along the energy chain: the discovery and development of new energy sources; generation of clean power; the infrastructure needed to store and distribute energy; and, finally, more efficient use of energy by consumers.</p> <p>Much of the first part of the spectrum relates to biofuels. In most cases, this refers to biodiesel or bioethanol currently made from food crops such as corn, sugarcane and rapeseed \u2013 collectively known as first-generation biofuels. \"Next-generation biofuels will be able to use a wider range of organic material or biomass including current waste material,\" says Richard White, a senior analyst at Library House. </p> <p>\"This will lead to a much greater yield of fuel per square metre of crop, and potentially the ability to grow biofuels where food crops would not grow, alleviating many of the criticisms associated with current biofuel.\"</p> <p>The next part of the energy chain, developing cleaner energy sources, is probably the most familiar to those outside the cleantech world. This includes extraction of energy from renewable sources such as the wind, sun and sea. The British government has committed to source 15% of its primary energy from renewable sources by 2020; that's around 40% of the country's electricity.</p> <p><strong>The tide is high</strong></p> <p>Wind turbines are a relatively mature technology, with several gigawatts of farms in planning stages around the UK. In addition, the country has high hopes for tidal power \u2013 experts estimate there could be up to 15GW of reliable power waiting to be harvested, and the Carbon Trust estimates that the global opportunities in the field could be up to \u00a3600bn. \"For the UK, the group of wet renewables \u2013 offshore wind, tidal stream and wave \u2013 are where the UK can have a global leadership role,\" said Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace UK.</p> <p>Solar power is one of the most established clean technology industries, but efficiency and manufacturing costs need to improve. Current solar panels rely on relatively expensive silicon chips but cutting-edge research includes work on ways to concentrate light, applying thin films of light absorbers to flexible surfaces and using nanotechnology to manipulate materials so that they can better harness the energy from the sun.</p> <p>Energy storage is also key when increasing amounts of power are generated from intermittent sources. \"When energy is produced and not required, it can be stored and released in periods of high demand or when the sun is not shining,\" said White. </p> <p>Further along the chain, better distribution and management of energy \u2013 the \"smart grid\" \u00ad\u00ad\u2013 will lead to more efficiency. \"The smart grid allows energy generators (power stations, solar farms) and consuming loads (your kettle, TV, etc) to interact with each other in real time, in both directions, with the aid of modern communications technology,\" says White.</p> <p>At end of the energy chain are developments based on more efficient use of power. These range from better insulation for buildings, through more efficient electronics in appliances, to improved monitoring of energy, using smart meters. \"Some of the companies in this field may be semiconductor companies at heart, but their developments have the potential for huge energy savings, giving them cleantech credentials,\" said White. </p> <p>\"Common devices such as televisions, lighting, fridges and computers all contribute significantly to energy use, and there is significant room for innovation to curb consumption in these areas.\" Greener transport (electric cars, fuel cells and other hybrids) also falls into this final bracket.</p> <p><strong>Broad spectrum</strong></p> <p>Besides the spectrum outlined by Library House, Goldsmith adds the efficient use of other resources such as technologies to handle the re-use of waste, water efficiency, pipelines and agricultural water use. \"Cleantech is learning to live within the resources of the planet,\" he says.</p> <p>But it will not all be plain sailing for the new climate-saving industries.

  "<p><strong>What is your biggest guilty green secret?</strong></p> <p>I have given up neither driving nor flying, although obviously I try to do both as little as possible. But I do believe very strongly that the change we need must not be driven by guilt - the worst possible motivation for anything - but by enlightened self-interest. We're the generation which in one lifetime has squandered the green capital which the planet has accumulated in one and a half million years. But for God's sake let's not beat ourselves up about it.</p> <p><strong>Do you know your carbon footprint?</strong></p> <p>I don't know my personal footprint but I do know my organic farm's footprint is half that of an industrial farm. </p> <p><strong>The last nice green thing you did?</strong></p> <p>Last Saturday I went along to the Soil Association's organic festival in Bath. Meeting some of the 300 exhibitors, all farmers who devote their lives to providing us with food, was inspiring. </p> <p><strong>What is your favourite green habit?</strong></p> <p>I love walking. And I love farming. But my favourite thing is eating food that comes from as close as possible to where I live, with my family and friends. The change we're looking for in society has to be life-enhancing, it's something we need to weave into the fabric of our lives: the post-fossil fuel world is not just about austerity.</p> <p><strong>If you could buy any green gadget, what would it be?</strong></p> <p>An electric tractor and a wind turbine to power it up, and also to power my milking machines. We could go back to horses and hand-milking but I'm not anxious to. I don't like the word gadget though: these are not gadgets, this is the new green technology and it's incredibly exciting. </p> <p><strong>What wakes you up in a sweat in the middle of the night?</strong></p> <p>That we're not doing enough in time. </p> <p><strong>What skill do you have for a post-oil world?</strong></p> <p>I can hand-milk cows. I can fish too. </p> <p>I don't think we're all going to have to become hunter-gatherers, but something about that rather appeals to me. </p> <p><strong>What would you save, apart from your family and friends, come the floods?</strong></p> <p>I'd try to save some time with myself. I think that the ecological crisis we're facing is also a spiritual crisis. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Patrick Holden is director of the Soil Association.

  "<p>\"I heard about this two hours ago,\" says Meghna Nayaka, 23, holding a beer. \"I was going to meet a friend for a drink anyway, so I thought, why not make a statement while we do it?\" Meghna and Becky, 24, are CarrotMobbing. They and others have swarmed, as part of a virtually mobilised group, on a small business to reward it with their custom. Tonight the business is the Redchurch, a bar near Brick Lane in east London, the owners of which have promised to spend 20% of the day's takings on environmental upgrades on the premises. In return, trade is brisk - unprecedented, says the owner, for a Tuesday evening in September. Next time the mob will pick somewhere different to reward - maybe a corner shop or a pharmacy, the type of high street store they might frequent anyway. </p> <p>The difference is that the business will have competed for custom and committed to adopting greener practices, and the mob organisers will have mobilised a spending spree to patronise the winner.</p> <p>CarrotMobbing emerged in the US earlier this year. It uses the \"carrot\" of consumer buying rather than the \"stick\" of boycotting or bad publicity to encourage ethical business. Alone, our consumer choices make a minimal impact, but together and organised we unlock a bigger bargaining power. CarrotMobbers talk about \"liberating\" their capital. They make demands of their suppliers; green improvements in exchange for loyalty. And they are prepared to reward in a language that companies understand: cash.</p> <p>The receipt roll had to be changed three times at the San Francisco CarrotMob. Three hundred shoppers assembled at K&amp;D Market to spend $9,276.50 in a couple of hours. Beforehand, Brent Schulkin, founder of <a href=\"http://www.CarrotMob.org\">CarrotMob.org</a>, met 24 shops in his area, telling each that he was organising a network of consumers and asking them to offer energy efficiency improvements in exchange for the monopoly of this mythical market. Competing offers were evaluated, and K&amp;D Market bid highest, pledging that 22% of the day's takings would be used to improve the lighting system and the hazardous waste disposal. It got environmental upgrades plus an improved reputation. The mob got a cleaner, greener local high street store. </p> <p>Direct action is nothing new, but usually it is in opposition to a system, rather than in cooperation with it. And now it has been mobilised by social networking. \"In the past when you wanted to say, 'Let's reward this one business,'\" says Schulkin, \"you would have no easy way of knowing whether every-one else was going to reward them too, that it wouldn't just be you.\" </p> <p>Today, with MySpace, Facebook, blogging, Twitter, Digg and YouTube calls to action, a single post from a credible, connected source such as Schulkin can mobilise what web expert Howard Rheingold calls a \"smart mob\" in an instant. Once rallied, the transition from online interest to offline activity is somewhat trickier, but CarrotMobbing is an activity people are happy with. It is about shopping. Milk, bread, beer: staples. There is no complicated barrier to entry. \"We're not saying, come to the rally and chant against your enemy,\" says Schulkin. \"CarrotMobs are fun community events. We're not asking you to go to some natural food store you've never heard of and buy some product you don't know how to use. It's familiar brands and familiar things to do.\" </p> <p>Shopping our way out of climate change has its critics. It's difficult to make a serious bid for environmentalism just because you have bought your weekly staples from a mob-designated shop (and then put them in a plastic bag). </p> <p>\"You can make an argument that we're promoting consumption,\" says Schulkin. \"But I think of it more that we're targeting existing consumption. CarrotMobbing is not saying that you have to spend more money. The idea is that you are spending money you would already be spending, you're just going to organise it. We harness the buying power of the casual consumer. This is not meant to be for the hardcore environmentalist, it's a movement designed to appeal to the mainstream masses.\" Which is perhaps why its first Britishincarnation is being held in a pub. </p> <p>Britain's first CarrotMob is not as mobilised as San Francisco's. It doesn't have the spontaneous, can-do energy of buying toothpaste, together, at a designated time. Punters are middle-class, work in renewables and bring their empty pint glasses back to the bar. Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace lobbyists network happily, and there are lots of people who call themselves \"social entrepreneurs\" but obviously spend too much time on the computer. Still the bar is doing great business and, if nothing else, 100 punters in a credit slump has turned pub manager Rocky into an evangelising green convert. When we go, we will leave a legacy of energy efficiency upgrades at the Redchurch, rubber-stamped by environmental assessors Global Action Plan.</p> <p>Like all good web 2.0 movements, CarrotMob is democratic. Anyone can plan a CarrotMob style event using Facebook. The next actions are already planned for Kansas City and Bristol in mid-October, and there are branches in Israel, Australia, Brazil and South Africa. </p> <p>Schulkin is globally ambitious. \"I see CarrotMob franchises all over the world translating good into profit.\" Whole networks of CarrotMob-approved venues; a thousand different local campaigns and a million mobilised shoppers ready to put their money where their mouth is. \"At that point,\" he says, \"I think we have critical mass to take on the larger companies.\" To demand that brands clean up their environmental policies or pay a living wage in return for our custom. \"We are the economy,\" says Schulkin. \"We decide who gets rich.\" </p> <p>It starts here. With this beer. We clink our glasses and say \"Cheers\".</p>",
  "<p>Airports operator BAA put Gatwick up for sale yesterday and paved the way for a politically charged auction by admitting it expects interest from state-backed foreign investors.</p> <p>Colin Matthews, the chief executive of Britain's largest airport owner, said sovereign wealth funds were likely bidders for the \u00a32bn business as the credit crisis has limited financing options for private equity and infrastructure funds.</p> <p>\"Every observer of the market knows where the money is, and I am sure that sovereign wealth funds would be one of the groups interested,\" Matthews said.</p> <p>Some of the wealthiest and most active funds, including Abu Dhabi Investment Capital, the Investment Corporation of Dubai and the Kuwait Investment Authority, are based in the Middle East.</p> <p>Louise Ellman MP, the Labour chair of the transport select committee, told the Guardian that selling the UK's second largest airport to a Middle Eastern investor would raise \"concerns\".</p> <p>\"This all seems to be a bit rushed. I think there would be a concern if there was a rush and a Middle Eastern interest bought Gatwick to the exclusion of a local business ... In the current international situation there would be concerns about a Middle Eastern interest having control over major transport and aviation infrastructure.\"</p> <p>BAA has been under foreign control since 2006, when it was bought by a consortium called Airport Development and Investment (ADI) in a largely debt-funded \u00a310.3bn deal. ADI's majority shareholder is Ferrovial, the Spanish infrastructure and construction conglomerate, with minority shareholdings owned by Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec, the Canadian pensions fund, and GIC Special Investments, a private equity company owned by the Singaporean government. </p> <p>News of the Gatwick sale prompted public expressions of interest from Manchester Airport Group (MAG); Fraport, the owner of Frankfurt airport; Hochtief, a German group that operates airports in Athens, Sydney and Budapest; Peel Airports, owner of Liverpool John Lennon airport; Global Infrastructure Partners, an investment fund co-founded by General Electric and Credit Suisse; and Virgin Atlantic. Babcock &amp; Brown, an Australian investment firm, is also believed to be interested. MAG, which is owned by local authorities, said yesterday that it was interested in discussing a consortium bid with sovereign wealth investors, but it would demand operational control. </p> <p>Matthews said the continuing inquiry into BAA by the competition commission was a \"big chunk of the motivation\" in putting Gatwick up for sale. In a provisional report last month, the commission said selling two of BAA's three London airports and either Glasgow or Edinburgh airport in Scotland could improve services.</p> <p>\"There is no point in waiting for another announcement,\" said Matthews. The final decision is next year. BAA also owns Heathrow and Stansted. He admitted public pressure had contributed to the decision to sell. \"A sense from BAA that we are blindly defending the status quo is not a smart way to deal with that. BAA is not refusing to listen to a widespread public conviction that it is time for a change.\"</p> <p>EasyJet, Gatwick's largest airline, said a sale would not deliver on its demand to reduce in landing fees, because the business would remain a local monopoly. \"Monopoly providers of nationally important infrastructure always need to be regulated to prevent irresponsible price gouging,\" said easyJet.</p> <p>Michael O'Leary, the chief executive of Ryanair, accused BAA of attempting to dissuade the competition commission from demanding a fundamental break-up by selling off Gatwick. \"Airlines and passengers have been abused for many years with high prices and abysmal service at all of the BAA's London and Scottish airports ... the trick of selling off Gatwick won't end this abusive monopoly.\" </p> <p>Matthews said the airport operator would continue to argue against selling Stansted and one of its Scottish airports. He said BAA should oversee the expansion of Stansted and Heathrow, because it has the expertise and financial firepower. \"Reasonable observers would recognise that capacity is more important than the question of ownership.\"</p> <p>Gatwick is prohibited from building a second runway until 2019 under the terms of an agreement with West Sussex council, but new owners might explore ways of overturning that deal. Regulators put Gatwick's value at \u00a32bn. However, British Airways moved several long-haul services to Heathrow this year, and the insolvency of Zoom and XL Airways has also hit Gatwick's income. Gatwick is the world's busiest single runway airport and handled 35 million passengers last year.</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p>BAA yesterday made an assertive move to determine its future, but its fate remains in the hands of the <strong>Competition Commission</strong>. Last month, the commission said it had found competition problems at all seven of BAA's airports and <strong>forced disposals </strong>were the best solution. It said BAA had used its control of the UK's largest airports to drag its heels over building <strong>new runways</strong>, resulting in overcrowding and poor service. A final verdict is expected in spring, but few expect a radical change of opinion.</p>",

  "<p>A \u00a312bn takeover of Britain's biggest lender, HBOS, failed to halt the deepening crisis in world financial markets last night, as a wave of fresh speculation on global stock markets saw two of Wall Street's most prestigious investment banks targeted as the latest victims of the credit crunch.</p> <p>On a day of frenetic activity and unfolding drama, shares in the City fell for a third day and Wall Street had a steep decline, despite attempts to restore calm through the takeover of HBOS by Lloyds TSB and the nationalisation of the US insurance giant AIG.</p> <p>The FTSE 100 index dropped more than 2% to close at 4912.4, its lowest level for more than three years. In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average closed down 449 points at 10,609, 25% below its peak in October last year. The price of gold rose 11% in its biggest ever one-day gain as investors searched for havens.</p> <p>Gordon Brown intervened to broker a solution to HBOS, and Downing Street made clear it was prepared to rip up competition laws to allow the takeover - a move which may cause the loss of tens of thousands of jobs and the closure of up to 500 branches. After intense negotiations, a deal was clinched shortly after 9.30pm, and is to be announced this morning. The two companies agreed that Lloyds TSB would pay 232p per HBOS share.</p> <p>Earlier, in an extraordinary day of trading for HBOS, shares in the bank halved in the first hour and at one stage stood at 88p. This sell-off led to news coming out of the proposed takeover, part of a contingency plan by the government to prevent a repeat of the Northern Rock fiasco. HBOS shares leaped above their opening level briefly, before another sell-off and closing the day down 20%.</p> <p>Other banks were also caught in the turmoil. Royal Bank of Scotland fell 10%.</p> <p>By the close of business:</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Shares in Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs had been pummelled. The two remaining investment banks after the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the takeover of Merrill Lynch faced questions about their ability to withstand the global turmoil. Shares in Goldman Sachs were down 19%. Morgan Stanley had a 24% decline, causing its chief executive, John Mack, to attack \"irresponsible\" speculators for spreading fear and rumour.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Dow Jones industrial average fell almost 4%, leading the securities and exchange commission - the US financial watchdog - to announce a clampdown on short-selling of shares, a process whereby speculators borrow stock in order to sell it and then buy it back at a lower price.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Bank of England announced that it was extending its special liquidity scheme, which is intended to ease pressures on banks, until the end of January. Until this week's turmoil in the markets, Mervyn King, the Bank's governor, had insisted that the facility, introduced in the wake of the collapse of Bear Stearns in the spring, would be closed next month.</p> <p>The announcement came as government figures showed a 32,500 rise in the number of people out of work and claiming benefit last month, the biggest increase for 16 years.</p> <p>A terse statement to the stock exchange by HBOS at lunchtime confirmed that it was in merger talks with Lloyds TSB: \"In the light of market speculation, the board of HBOS confirms it is in advanced talks with Lloyds TSB which may or may not lead to an offer being made for HBOS.\" Lloyds TSB made no comment on the proposed deal then, but it was understood that its chairman, Sir Victor Blank, and chief executive, Eric Daniels, would be at the helm of the newly merged company.</p> <p>City sources said last night that the relatively small amount of cash withdrawals from HBOS - amounting to \u00a31bn of its \u00a3250bn of deposits - showed that the bank was fundamentally sound but had fallen foul of a collective loss of investor confidence in the banking industry.</p> <p>A link-up between the two high street banks would normally fall foul of Britain's tough competition laws, but the Treasury made clear that John Hutton, the business and enterprise secretary, would use emergency powers to stop it being referred to the Competition Commission. Government sources said the severity of the crisis meant there was no alternative but to waive competition rules.</p> <p>HBOS, which owns Halifax, insisted on Tuesday it was not in trouble, but is seen by the markets as particularly vulnerable to the fall in UK house prices. The bank has 22 million customers, accounts for 20% of the mortgage market, and takes in one pound in every six saved in the UK.</p> <p>The US authorities were last night scrutinising the health of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley following a 10-day period in which they have nationalised the country's two biggest lenders - Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac - refused to bail out Lehman Brothers, helped orchestrate the takeover of Merrill Lynch, and provided an $85bn lifeline to AIG, whose failure would have sent shockwaves through the global financial system. The insurer said it would be business as usual, albeit under government control.</p> <p>New York state's insurance superintendent, Eric Dinallo, who helped broker the bailout, accused firms of poor management in diversifying far too broadly.</p> <p>\"It is clear to me that financial services and insurance has gotten away from its core competence and that is dangerous,\" said Dinallo, who compared such companies' strategies to driving a car while putting on make-up, looking at a BlackBerry and having a conversation.</p>",
  "<p>Antisemitism and Islamophobia are on the rise across Europe, according to a survey of global opinion released yesterday.</p> <p>In contrast to the US and Britain where unfavourable opinion of Jews has been stable and low for several years at between 7 and 9%, the Pew Survey of Global Attitudes found that hostile attitudes to Jews were rising all across continental Europe from Russia and Poland in the east to Spain and France in the west.</p> <p>The survey found that suspicion of Muslims in Europe was considerably higher than hostility to Jews, but that the increase in antisemitism had taken place much more rapidly. </p> <p>\"Great Britain stands out as the only European country included in the survey where there has not been a substantial increase in antisemitic attitudes,\" the survey found.</p> <p>Antisemitism has more than doubled in Spain over the past three years, with a rise from 21% to 46%, the survey of almost 25,000 people across 24 countries found, while more than one in three Poles and Russians also had unfavourable opinions of Jews.</p> <p>In the same period antisemitism in Germany and France also rose - from 21% to 25% in Germany and from 12% to 20% in France among those saying they had unfavourable opinions of Jews.</p> <p>\"Opinions of Muslims in almost all of these countries was were more negative than are views of Jews,\" analysts said. While Americans and Britons displayed the lowest levels of antisemitism, one in four in both countries were hostile to Muslims. </p> <p>Such Islamophobia was lower than in the rest of Europe. More than half of Spaniards and half of Germans said that they did not like Muslims and the figures for Poland and France were 46% and 38% for those holding unfavourable opinions of Muslims.</p> <p>People who were antisemitic were likely also to be Islamophobes. Prejudice was marked among older generations and appeared to be class based. People over 50 and of low education were more likely to be prejudiced.</p>",

  "<p>A footballer must decide between a transfer to Tottenham Hotspur, Newcastle United or Aston Villa. He has three demands: a) the new club is near an airport boasting daily flights to Dubai where his girlfriend likes to tan and shop; b) a branch of Waitrose is close by; and c) the local property market remains awash with six-bedroom, four-bathroom homes boasting triple garages and electronic gates. Which club meets his criteria?</p> <p>The answer is all three. The enduring myth that a north-south divide makes it tough for clubs outside London to attract top talent is exploding. Whether he parks his fleet of blacked-out windowed, personalised number-plated 4x4s and Baby Bentleys in Harrogate or Hornchurch, a Premier League footballer's lifestyle is pretty homogenous. However powerful the lure of London, a world city, how many Arsenal or Chelsea players actually live within the congestion-charge zone? Most reside around the M25, in \"anywhere\" places such as Cobham, St Albans, Brentwood and Sevenoaks.</p> <p>I once doorstepped a manager living in a well heeled road in Sevenoaks (the attempt failed, not least because he possessed two ferocious-looking dogs) which struck me as a virtual identikit of a street in another football mecca, Newcastle's upmarket Darras Hall. On planet football there is no north-south cultural split, no gulf in health care, employment opportunities or quality of diet, just a group of fit young men who tend to colonise England's wealthiest locales. And, whisper it, Portsmouth and Middlesbrough are pretty interchangeable. We know this because Gary O'Neil says so.</p> <p>The Boro midfielder, late of Portsmouth, speaks with the zeal of the converted. Just last Thursday I attended a press conference where he admitted that he and especially his wife were so unsure about relocating to Teesside that last season he asked Gareth Southgate for a move back south. Boro's manager instead persuaded him to give northern life one last try and the couple have never looked back.</p> <p>\"I don't think there is a north-south divide - well, not now,\" said O'Neil. \"I've realised there's no real difference between the two.\"</p> <p>Anyone who imagines he was merely being polite has clearly never visited Yarm, home to many a Boro star and the sort of Georgian market town which could comfortably be transposed into Surrey or Cheshire. These days O'Neil, his wife and toddler daughter are happily settled near there.</p> <p>Having discovered that North Yorkshire life is actually much the same as its Hampshire equivalent, the couple are now suspicious of regional stereotyping. But it is often perpetuated by those who should know better - Kevin Keegan fell into the trap in January when he talked, cringe-inducingly, about \"southerners going to the theatre and northerners the match\".</p> <p>In reality there are far more similarities than differences between people and places in England - all urbanisations are social mosaics harbouring grotty areas. When Roy Hodgson was in charge of Blackburn he drove the long way round between his home and Rovers' picturesque Ribble Valley training ground in order not to become \"depressed\" negotiating the town centre.</p> <p>Compare that with where he is now, at Fulham. As wealthy as Craven Cottage's environs are, Hodgson surely finds it much harder to bypass the pockets of deprivation studded along routes in and out of the capital. And in his heart of hearts does he really believe the food in many London restaurants is any better than that served in the Clitheroe bistros he once frequented, or the dinner-table chat more intelligent?</p> <p>The humour is arguably superior in Blackburn. When the club's then defender St\u00e9phane Henchoz moaned that East Lancashire was \"always dark by 3.30pm\" the players' car-park attendant presented him with a gift-wrapped searchlight.</p> <p>Much to Roy Keane's chagrin, though, players' Wags doubt the quality of north-east shopping - which rather highlights their ignorance, because Newcastle airport not only offers daily flights to Dubai but Barcelona, Milan, Paris and, naturally, London too.</p> <p>As Sunderland's manager, who judges places \"on how much people love walking their dogs\", reflected: \"Players who say living in the north would bore them are usually boring people.\"</p> <p>Personally I think they are more frightened. In an era when we are all supposed to inhabit a global village, too many of us, footballers included, are scared to move out of our parochial comfort zones. Just ask Gary O'Neil.</p>",
  "<p>It was quite a party in Moscow 119 days ago and the suspicion lingers that Manchester United are still struggling to get over the hangover. It is now two victories from six matches for Sir Alex Ferguson's side, after Villarreal made sure that the Champions League holders endured a frustrating start to their defence of the trophy that was lifted in such dramatic fashion in May. There was no such excitement here as United toiled against the La Liga runners-up, continuing their unconvincing start to the season.</p> <p>Jonny Evans hit the post late on and Carlos Tevez had an effort cleared off the line, but Villarreal were not a side under siege. Cristiano Ronaldo's appearance as a second-half substitute lifted the mood but there was to be no storybook return for the Portuguese. Resilient and obdurate, Villarreal departed with a point that brings to an end United's record of 12 consecutive home victories in the Champions League, leaving Ferguson still searching for a remedy to the malaise that has left his side looking strangely subdued.</p> <p>Ferguson pointed to recent seasons, when United have often taken some time to get into their stride, but that trait offers little comfort given the domestic form of Liverpool and Chelsea. United visit Stamford Bridge on Sunday and, should Chelsea prevail and Liverpool defeat Stoke 24 hours earlier, Ferguson will be staring at a nine-point deficit on both clubs before the leaves have started to fall from the trees. Recovering from a home draw in the Champions League should not be as problematic but this, all the same, was an uninspiring opening.</p> <p>\"I think we are a bit short in terms of sharpness and clinical finishing,\" said Ferguson, who learned earlier in the day that he might face disciplinary action from the Football Association after his comments about Keith Hackett, the head of the Professional Game Match Officials Board, concerning the decision to overturn John Terry's red card. \"We expressed ourselves well tonight. We created a lot of good chances and I think we are going to improve on today. It's not the worst result but it could have been better for us.\"</p> <p>The United manager insisted that his side could have recorded a resounding victory on another occasion but few would have departed Old Trafford feeling there had been a miscarriage of justice. United enjoyed far more possession and were undoubtedly in the ascendancy but Villarreal might easily have collected three points had Guille Franco used the side of his boot rather than the heel to connect with Angel L\u00f3pez's cross on the hour mark. Instead, the ball came back off the inside of the post and United earned a reprieve.</p> <p>In fairness, there were few other moments of genuine concern in the United rearguard on a night when both managers suggested the Champions League was not top of their current priorities. Ferguson, with one eye on Sunday, indicated he had left out Nemanja Vidic because the Serb is suspended for the Chelsea match, with the United manager admitting he had yet to decide whether Wes Brown, who was an unused substitute here, or the 20-year-old Evans would partner Rio Ferdinand in central defence at Stamford Bridge.</p> <p>Paul Scholes, suspended last night, and Dimitar Berbatov, who was sidelined with a knee injury, are both expected to return and Ronaldo's late cameo increases the likelihood that he will be available for the tete-a-tete with his former national team manager, Luiz Felipe Scolari. Cheered from the moment he started warming up, the winger's attempts to force through a move to Real Madrid in the summer seemed forgotten. He might even have grabbed a goal but Nani's inviting cross was headed wide from six yards.</p> <p>Others were also guilty of profligacy. The industrious Tevez, whose angled drive stung the hands of the Villarreal goalkeeper, Diego L\u00f3pez, during a largely uneventful first half, should have forced a breakthrough in the 72nd minute but Wayne Rooney's firm pass demanded a touch when the Argentinian would have liked to have shot first time. The delay proved crucial, with Gonzalo Rodr\u00edguez getting back to make a desperate clearance from the goalline after Tevez had slid the ball under L\u00f3pez and expected to celebrate the opening goal.</p> <p>United also had strong claims for a penalty rejected when Park Ji-sung, who along with Owen Hargreaves and Ronaldo was getting some much-needed match practice, was upended by Joan Capdevila only for Wolfgang Stark, the referee, to wave play on. It was in the latter stages, however, that Ferguson's side came closest to scoring, the introduction of Ronaldo injecting United with renewed zest. His arrival came too late to bring a goal but it at least provided Ferguson and the home fans with a positive footnote.</p>",

  "<p>Unemployment last month suffered its biggest rise since the early 1990s while factory orders are falling at their fastest pace in almost three years - the latest batch of economic indicators to suggest Britain is heading into recession.</p> <p>The number of people claiming jobless benefit jumped 32,500 in August from July, the biggest rise since December 1992 and the seventh increase in a row, the Office for National Statistics said. The rise was greater than expected while July's 20,000 increase was revised to 28,000.</p> <p>On the wider Labour Force Survey measure, joblessness rose 81,000 to 1.72 million between May and July, the highest level since 1999. The jobless rate rose by 0.2% to 5.5% in the three months to July.</p> <p>The data also showed a 71,000 jump in the number who had left the workforce because they could not find a job, and a sharp rise in youth unemployment. </p> <p>David Blanchflower, one of the Bank of England's interest rate setters who has said unemployment will hit 2 million this year, said: \"This is a large increase and there is much worse to come because big job losses in the construction and financial sectors have yet to feed through.\" </p> <p>There was also a first fall for nearly two years in the employment level, which fell 16,000 to 29.54 million in the three months to July. The drop in employment has been concentrated in manufacturing and retailing.</p> <p>John Philpott, chief economist at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, said: \"This greatly increases the chances of what earlier in the year we warned might be an autumn and winter avalanche of redundancies, which would propel the unemployment rate back over two million in 2009.\"</p> <p>Philpott's comments came as the TUC warned that the number of people out of work could hit 2 million by next year, partly as a result of the government's tougher regime for claiming benefits. </p> <p>TUC general secretary Brendan Barber said: \"With unemployment rising, people are looking to the government for a response and economic measures will be far more welcome than yet another round of welfare reforms.\"</p> <p>The one bright spot in the figures was that average earnings increased by 3.5% in the year to July, 0.1% up from the previous month but well below the 4.5% that the Bank of England considers compatible with low inflation. And that was in spite of inflation picking up to 4.7%, its highest level for 16 years.</p> <p>\"We suspect wage moderation will continue as rising unemployment undermines workers' bargaining power and companies become ever more determined to limit their wage bill in the face of high input costs and softening demand,\" said Howard Archer, economist at Global Insight.</p> <p>Meanwhile, manufacturers' order books fell at their fastest pace in almost three years in September. </p> <p>The CBI's monthly industrial trends survey showed that the total order books balance dropped to -26%, from -13% last month - the lowest reading since January 2006. Firms now expect to cut output over the next three months at the sharpest rate in nearly seven years. </p> <p>However, there was some good news for the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, which sets the Bank's base rate. Inflationary pressures started to subside with the balance of manufacturers expecting to raise their prices over the next three months retreated to +23% in September from +31% in August and an 18-year high of +34% in July.</p>",
  "<p>At the start of the second world war it was the bananas that went first. With the fire of London it was rats. As the British economy continues its whoopee-cushion-style contraction, the effects of impending meltdown are also being felt in some unexpected places. Last season brought the near collapse of Northern Rock, Newcastle United's shirt sponsors. A week ago West Ham's sponsors XL went bust, prompting the removal of their name from the club strip. At the weekend the Hammers played West Bromwich Albion, also without a logo after failing to find a deal. Even more ominously, post-Lehman Brothers all the talk is of the travails of the insurance giant AIG - which happens to be the shirt sponsors of Manchester United. For big business the writing isn't so much on the wall as on the chests of the nation's footballers.</p> <p>This is all very much in keeping with football's rampage into the cultural and economic mainstream. For the past decade or so the Premier League has acted as convenient shorthand for the wildest excesses of the UK's consumer-driven economic boom, an acme of vulgar consumption. Now, as the tide continues to turn, football is right back in the vanguard of things, a sandpiper running ahead of the surf. Never mind the inflation basket, the job-seekers' queue or the cost of borrowing. Future economic historians will be able to measure the progress of the credit crunch by English football's folding shirt sponsors. </p> <p>This isn't the first time football shirts have delivered an oblique commentary on changing economic times. Kit sponsorship was first permitted as recently as 1979, the same year Margaret Thatcher came to power. It would be a further 10 years before clubs were actually allowed to wear their logo-plastered strips on live television. But in those early days kit sponsorship arrived in a rush, a visible symbol of the early Thatcherite emphasis on consumer-led economy, a decade of ad-boom and marketing thrust. </p> <p>Early football-kit sponsors were often drawn from the middle ranks of domestic commerce: breweries, garden centres, double-glazers, photocopier suppliers, package holiday dealers. The names of those first-generation shirt sponsors read like an elegy for changing times: Talbot at Coventry City; British Caledonian at Ipswich; the mysterious Withey Windows at Norwich; plus assorted small-town accountancy firms and business consultancies. An exception was Liverpool's 1979 strip, with its striking white HITACHI, which is generally considered shirt sponsorship's first iconic design. The stark capitals tested to the full the FA's draconian, if charmingly pre-decimal, restrictions: 16 square inches, with letters no more than two inches high. </p> <p>There was another side to all this, a meeting of minds with what was happening in the stands. The encroachment of labels and brands wasn't just a football thing, it was a 1980s thing. And so the terraces gave us the casual, the game's most decisive extension into high-street fashion, ultimately via the likes of JD Sports and assorted other leisurewear providers. For the label-obsessive fan, the newly commerce-spattered football ground provided the perfect catwalk to parade his Fred Perry, his Lyle &amp; Scott and his crimplene Sergio Tacchini tracksuit top. With the casual, football provided a youth movement that pre-figured the past 20 years of label-conscious culture and the fetishising of the visible blue-chip clothing brand. </p> <p>Liverpool fans are widely credited with kick-starting the movement, inspired in part by their team's trips to Italy in the European Cup. As the players paraded their Hitachi kit, soon to be followed by the Crown Paints era, supporters stocked up on priceless limited-edition continental labels, to be flaunted on their return to the domestic terrace. The mature casual look emerged as something close to an ambitious junior executive on a golfing weekend after getting dressed in the dark in a branch of TK Maxx. It's a look that football has bequeathed to the nation's shopping centres, one that arrived hand in hand with kit sponsorship and has matured with the growth of the replica shirt as leisurewear. Perhaps the turning of the tide for the shirt sponsor might even prefigure a similar era of brand austerity on the pinched, crunched and pressed UK high street. </p> <p>In many ways the disappearing logo is to be celebrated. Not just as a sop to the traditionalist lament about rampant and all-consuming commercialism. There have also been some terrible mistakes along the way, as two distinct and separately focus-grouped design forces, the kit and the commercial logo, have been dramatically conjoined. </p> <p>Aston Villa's claret and blue was briefly augmented by a migraine-inducing bright purple and lime-green sponsor's logo. At the junk-food end of things the brief partnership of convenience between Pizza Hut and the black-and-white shirts of Fulham spawned the vaguely nauseating incongruity of extreme physical activity and a dinner-plate-sized deep-dish food product. The same with Wolves and their giant Doritos logo. It just didn't sit well.</p> <p>Arsenal provided a few laughs during their Sega shirt period, a word that would be regularly removed during away trips to play in Spain (sega means \"wank\" in Spanish). West Ham spent five years displaying the name of kit manufactures Pony, which in the local East London rhyming slang means \"crap\" (from pony and trap). </p> <p>There have some quirky additions too. For several seasons Tranmere Rovers were sponsored by Wirral borough council. Presumably it needed the publicity. Clydebank were briefly sponsored by the pop group Wet Wet Wet. For years Atl\u00e9tico Madrid's owners, Columbia Pictures, would change the club's shirt sponsor according to which Hollywood blockbuster was on release. Atletico's Spiderman II period involved a total redesign of the away shirt. </p> <p>The current trend for the disappearing logo also tells us much about football and its miraculously self-sustaining revenue streams. Until now football has surfed above the credit crunch, its finances mysteriously fizzing with independent life. During the summer transfer window, record amounts - some estimate as much as \u00a3500m - were spent by English clubs. For now, at least, it's still all boom at the very top. </p> <p>Disappearing sponsors notwithstanding, this looks set to continue for a while. Early kit deals may have opened up a vital new source of revenue. But this was in the pre-hyper inflationary days when even the big clubs wrestled annually to balance their relatively meager turnover. Space on Manchester United's shirts is currently leased out for close to \u00a310m a season, but this is hardly make-or-break money. The disappearance of AIG would simply be an inconvenience, or an opportunity for a merchandise-shifting rebrand. These days the kitty is stocked by TV rights deals, billionaire owners and the global merchandising arm. </p> <p>With this in mind, a new trend among clubs involves abandoning the commercial sponsor altogether in favour of something philanthropic. This season Aston Villa are sponsored by the Acorns children's hospice, a gesture on the part of the club's billionaire owner, Randy Lerner, to emphasise Villa's community ties. Similarly, but on a more global scale, Barcelona are currently wearing the name of Unicef: a freebie perhaps, but also a canny addition to the Catalans' club-of-the-people brand. </p> <p>For now the disappearing football-shirt logo remains a hieroglyph of troubles elsewhere, an indicator of the economic meltdown on the thermals of which football continues to float in its own superheated fiscal bubble. For how much longer remains to be seen, of course. The shirt logo has had its say in the past. Perhaps, like the marauding rats of the great fire, you ignore it at your peril.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Monday September 22 2008. Barcelona's shirts bear Unicef's logo, not Unesco's as we said in the article above about football sponsorship. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>Russia yesterday suspended trading on its two main stock exchanges after shares plummeted for a second day, forcing the central bank to intervene. </p> <p>Regulators halted trading at midday local time on Russia's main stock indices - the rouble-denominated MICEX and the dollar-denominated RTS - after a similar suspension on Tuesday. By 6pm in Moscow last night, they had not reopened.</p> <p>Russia has been hit by the global financial crisis, suffering as stocks dived in Europe and Asia. It has also been hurt by a rapid fall in oil prices and the flight of foreign investors since its dispute with Georgia.</p> <p>Yesterday, Russia's finance ministry said it was pumping nearly $60bn (\u00a334bn) into the three largest banks - Sberbank, VTB and Gazprombank - to shore up liquidity in the banking system. With the Kremlin last night promising further measures, finance minister Alexei Kudrin said he did not expect to use Russia's enormous reserves. Instead, he suggested larger banks would lend to \"small and medium banks\" unable to settle their obligations. </p> <p>On Tuesday, Russia's central bank and finance ministry injected $20bn into money markets. But there was growing speculation one of Russia's largest investment banks, KIT Finance, could be the next victim of the global crisis. It failed to settle accounts on Tuesday and is in urgent talks to find a strategic investor.</p> <p>Russia's economic crisis is superficially reminiscent of the 1998 crash when the rouble was devalued, banks defaulted on loans and the savings of many ordinary people were wiped out overnight.</p> <p>Yesterday, however, analysts pointed out the Russian economy is much stronger than it was a decade ago. Additionally, it is integrated into the world economy - one of the reasons for its predicament. </p> <p>\"The mood is changing rapidly. But at the moment I'm cautiously optimistic,\" Natalia Orlova, chief economist at Alfa Bank told the Guardian. Russia had low foreign debt, a budget surplus and $200bn in a stabilisation fund, she said, before conceding: \"We are clearly facing a confidence crisis in the banking sector. Potentially it might have serious complications in the long term. But the financial crisis will not be as significant as in the US or western Europe.\"</p> <p>Chris Weafer, chief strategist at Uralsib bank, wrote in a note to investors, \"The market is trading as if it [Russia] is close to a default. In reality it has the world's third-largest financial reserves and is earning about $850m (\u00a3460m) every day from crude, oil products and gas exports.\"</p> <p>On Tuesday, Russia's markets showed their biggest single-day loss, with the RTS falling 11.5% and the MICEX slumping 17.5%.

He said the implementation of the larger electricity-generation projects, for example, can sometimes be hampered by a lack of pull from markets locked into older carbon-intensive methods, particularly in the energy sector. </p> <p>\"One can't rule out a disruptive technology. But I don't think we can generalise from IT, mobiles and so on, where they were offering new functionality in an essentially unregulated area, and translate that over to energy where there are incumbents who have been performing these functions as cheaply as they can in a market driven by cost,\" said Parr. </p> <p>\"It's going to need some political drive and will to re-arrange the deckchairs so that new technologies are in with a shout.\"</p> <p>Peversely, environmental concerns can also threaten to cripple the smaller projects.

  "<p>The continuing, if not escalating, US and UK financial crisis is repeatedly punctuated in the media by failed brokers and bankers blaming it all on the fall in property prices (Banks: the contagion spreads, September 17). But it is illogical that the booming real economy should wreak havoc in the money economy. The reality is that massive amounts of our cash have been siphoned off - much of it via tax havens - to enable global gambling in impenetrable derivatives; which has so confused the regulators, auditors and the corporate world that few, if any, understand the banks' balance sheets, and have lost all track of the relationships between the real economy and the money economy.</p> <p>The alleged property \"crash\" is a tiny percentage of housing stock being auctioned off; 95% of property is not in forced sale and it retains its (real) value to the owners and tenants. And when traditional banking returns, property, land, factories and other real assets in the real world will still be the banks' main securities for loans.</p> <p>The real economy is fine. It is the money economy that needs fixing - and it is the duty of governments to fix it. <br><strong>Noel Hodson</strong><br>Oxford </p> <p>Governments worldwide have been totally complacent about the financial markets and the negative effects of globalisation. Politicians have looked at the bright side of the equation for political expediency and short-term gain. In Britain too much emphasis has been placed on the financial side of the economy to the point where we are dependent on 25% of our output from the City alone. </p> <p>Added to this, service industries now account for over 80% of GDP. Therefore the government has theoretically placed all our economic eggs in the one basket and has taken no notice of the need for a manufacturing sector. Let us hope therefore, like 23 scientific and economic Nobel prize winners recommended some 11 years ago, that if a new Conservative government is brought to power, it will create our economy based upon hi-tech manufacturing industries and not intangible commodities that have brought us to the dire state of affairs that we find ourselves in today. <br><strong>Dr David Hill</strong><br>Huddersfield</p> <p>We should be hearing far more about the role of the corporate credit rating agencies - mainly Standard &amp; Poor's, Moody's and Fitch - which are at the root of the current financial mayhem. Effectively in collusion with investment institutions, they devised esoteric \"Monte Carlo\" rating techniques to pass off complex and obscure financial products as being low risk when, in fact, they contained a great deal of high risk, such as sub-prime mortgages. Those involved made vast profits from the associated fees and commissions at the expense of millions of unwary investors. Unless the activities of these rating agencies and investment institutions are regulated, and investment products are made to be more transparent, history will repeat itself.<br><strong>Keith Fisher</strong><br>Oxford </p> <p>Michael Meacher's prescription for curing the financial crisis (Letters, September 16) is misguided. He advocates reintroducing Glass-Steagall, and the statutory separation of investment from commercial banking. But recent failures have not been among the integrated institutions, but have been pure investment banks (such as Lehman) or pure commercial banks (such as Northern Rock). If anything, the integrated banks appear to be best placed to weather the storms.<br><strong>Nicholas Aleksander</strong><br>London</p> <p>Where are the big ideas? It's all either deckchair arranging or gleeful celebration as the ship of state slips into the icy, black depths (Crunch time, G2, September 17). Here's a big idea - remutualisation.</p> <p>Halifax, formerly part of HBOS, was once a well run mutual building society - run for the benefit of its lenders and borrowers. Now, it's been almost destroyed for the short-term benefit of speculators and bonus-hungry managers. As failing banks come begging, the government could make remutualisation a condition of bridging loans. Other sectors, such as retail, could also be made into staff partnerships. John Lewis, for example, is the model retail organisation in the UK - its staff have an interest in making the business a success because they own it. Similarly, utilities - why should we pay more just so others can profit (including the French government in the case of EDF)? Give profits back to the users - mutualise them.</p> <p>Not communism, not capitalism, but there is a third way - mutuality!<br><strong>Keith Mason</strong><br>London</p> <p>For those of us who are neither keen on large-scale monopoly capitalism nor of state control, why can not we look towards syndicalism - workers' control. Most workers' cooperatives seem to avoid the problems of excessive payments to the rich, with typically the highest paid getting not more than seven times the salary paid to the least well off. It also avoids the extreme fluctuations in share prices when we get over-hyped optimism or pessimism.<br><strong>David Spurling</strong><br>Sittingbourne, Kent</p> <p>Having nationalised some of the world's chief financial institutions, is George Bush the biggest socialist in history?<br><strong>David Voas</strong><br>Eyam, Derbyshire</p> <p>The collection of leftwingers' comments in G2 was fascinating.

  "<p>Call it serendipity, but as dusk settled over Canary Wharf on Monday evening, Gordon Brown glanced across the offices of Citigroup and spotted Sir Victor Blank, chairman of Lloyds TSB. </p> <p>The prime minister had plenty on his mind after a weekend in which Labour backbenchers had been calling for his head and the plunging financial markets had posed a fresh threat to his economic legacy as chancellor. Brown could have been forgiven for thinking he had better things to do than sip champagne with the City's dwindling band of masters of the universe, but bumping into Blank made attending the reception worthwhile. Here, potentially, was a white knight for HBOS, Britain's biggest mortgage lender.</p> <p>It would make a more dramatic story to say that the friendly chat between prime minister and banker paved the way for a 24-hour whirlwind of activity that led to the Lloyds TSB takeover bid for HBOS. The reality is more prosaic. Blank has been preparing to ride to the rescue for several months, with tentative talks with HBOS under way since July. The conversations were polite, but did not go far. HBOS saw no immediate reason to give up its independence after raising - with difficulty - \u00a34bn to boost its capital base. But the HBOS board, led by Lord Stevenson, also knew it needed to keep its options open.</p> <p>Events in New York on Sunday changed all that. Alistair Darling, the chancellor, was in close touch with the US treasury secretary as the American authorities decided not to bail out Wall Street's fourth biggest investment bank, Lehman Brothers and to orchestrate the takeover of the third biggest, Merrill Lynch, by Bank of America. </p> <p>Mervyn King, the Bank of England governor, was briefed by Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, and was aware that the hurricane season was about to see a financial gale sweep across the Atlantic on Monday morning. British sources said yesterday that they were fully aware of what was going to happen to Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch. They knew that there were likely to be big repercussions in the UK. After the Northern Rock fiasco, they were fully braced for a UK institution to find itself in trouble. And after the speculative attack on its shares in March, they had a sneaking suspicion that that bank might be HBOS. </p> <p>Chastened by the criticism of their handling of Northern Rock, the Treasury, the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority were determined not to get caught on the back foot again. They had conducted war games to work out what they would do if there was a risk of another bank run. King and Darling were kept fully informed on Monday as the FSA trawled through the finances of British banks to see which were particularly vulnerable.</p> <p>The fears of the UK authorities proved justified. In early trading on Monday, shares in HBOS were down 36%. The pain inflicted on Tuesday was even worse. At one point the shares were down more than 40% - a staggering amount for the 30th biggest bank in the world. Appeals for calm by HBOS, that kept insisting it was financially sound, fell on deaf ears.</p> <p>The stakes were high. More than \u00a31 in every \u00a36 of savings is looked after by HBOS. Almost one in five mortgages is held by Halifax. Its commercial banking business provides loans to big business. By chance, the chancellor was due to meet King and Sir Callum McCarthy, the chairman of the FSA, for a regular meeting of the tripartite group on Tuesday. The meeting was held over lunch in 11 Downing Street, with the selling of HBOS shares top of the agenda. McCarthy, whose term at the FSA ends tomorrow, had brought along his successor Lord Turner for a low-key final meeting. It didn't turn out quite like that, with the three men discussing when and how to activate the contingency plan. The authorities had tested the appetite of Stephen Green, the chairman of HSBC, to see whether he might be interested in a bid too.</p> <p>King, who had been opposed to extending the Bank's emergency lending scheme, now agreed to extend it for three months. By the time the Downing Street meeting was over, trading in London was winding down. While HBOS's statement to the stockmarket on Tuesday helped stem the decline, the recovery was hardly convincing. The shares ended the day down 22% - more than a two-thirds fall in the share price in two days. More worryingly, the financial markets had dried up. Banks would only trade with each other, reluctant to quote interest rates for the usual trading periods of three months, six months and one year. This further caused worries for HBOS which needs the money markets to fund 40% of its operations.</p> <p>As soon as the stockmarket closed at 4.30pm, discussions between Lloyds TSB and HBOS began. These were not the low-key sounding-out sessions of July, but serious attempts to broker a deal that could be announced before HBOS shares suffered a fresh collapse. </p> <p>The market found out before a deal was clinched. Just as well, though, because HBOS shares halved in the first hour of trading yesterday. The leak about the deal helped stem the decline. But the shares still ended 19% down, when they might have been expected to sky-rocket.</p>",
  "<p>A year ago it would have been unthinkable that HBOS would be taken over by Lloyds TSB. And, perhaps more significantly, that Lloyds would ever be allowed to do so.</p> <p>After all, the competition authorities stopped Lloyds from taking over Abbey National, HBOS's closest rival, in July 2001. It was an \u00a318bn deal that Lloyds had been desperate to clinch.</p> <p>But it would have cost at least 9,000 jobs and led to the closure of branches up and down the high street.</p> <p>Patricia Hewitt, the trade and industry secretary at the time, upheld the decision by the competition watchdogs and decided that the merger would be against the public interest.</p> <p>At the time, Abbey was regarded as one of the few players able to compete against the big four high street banks - Barclays, Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland/NatWest and HSBC - which had a stranglehold on current accounts and small-business banking. HBOS was seen as the next most likely bank to tackle the big four.</p> <p>HBOS did prove its mettle as a competitor to the leading lenders. Former chief executive Sir James Crosby always reminded the media that he was \"eating the big four's lunch\". But times are different now. Abbey has been taken over by Santander which is also in the process of taking over Alliance &amp; Leicester.</p> <p>During the Abbey deal, the competition authorities considered ideas such as the disposal of Lloyds' Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester division, or Abbey's Cahoot,</p> <p>to try to address the concerns about market dominance.</p> <p>Such divestments are unlikely to matter now, although it is not clear how competition rules can be ignored.</p> <p>The government can only use a public interest test to stop deals in the defence and media sectors.</p> <p>The rules governing competition and merger may need rewriting because the takeover of HBOS means there will be less competition on the high street.</p> <p>It may also mean that all the high street banks are up for grabs if the competition issues that once dictated its shape no longer stand.</p> <p>Fewer banks could mean higher mortgage rates for borrowers as there is less competition. It will also mean less choice for consumers.</p> <p>The shape of high street banking feels as if it is about to change dramatically. </p> <h2>HBOS</h2> <p><strong>Share price yesterday:</strong><br>-35p<br>147p</p> <p><strong>Market cap \u00a37.75bn</strong></p> <p>Britain's biggest mortgage lender is locked in merger talks with Lloyds TSB as fears grow over its ability to survive the credit crunch.</p> <p><strong>Expert view</strong> \"We consider that HBOS is less well positioned compared with major UK peers given the composition of its UK mortgage book, which accounts for over half of its total loan book.

The Arizona thinktank condemned the Alaska governor as a \"global warming denier\".</p> <p>\"Governor Palin has waged a deceptive, dangerous, and costly battle against the polar bear,\" Kieran Suckling, the centre's director, said. \"Her position on global warming is so extreme, she makes Dick Cheney look like an Al Gore devotee.\"</p> <p>The slap comes less than a week after Palin belatedly admitted the possibility of a human factor in climate change, in her first television interview since she was chosen as John McCain's running mate.</p> <p>The conversion was followed by further revelations of Palin's tenuous relationship with scientific fact. News reports yesterday said that Palin bought a tanning bed and moved it into the governor's mansion soon after her election. A few months later, in May 2007, she issued a proclamation during skin cancer awareness month urging Alaskans to take preventive measures. \"Skin cancer is caused, overwhelmingly, by overexposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun and from tanning beds,\" she said in a press release.</p> <p>McCain had skin cancers removed in 1993 and 2000, and is religious about using sun screen and wearing a hat outdoors.</p>",
  "<p>Merrill Lynch's newly recruited chief executive, John Thain, stands to share a $200m (\u00a3111.4m) payout with two senior lieutenants for less than a year's work which culminated this week in the bank surrendering its 94-year-old independence.</p> <p>The Wall Street bank known as the \"thundering herd\" agreed to a $50bn takeover by Bank of America on Monday after a hasty 48 hours of negotiation. The talks were prompted by fears over banking stability arising from the collapse of Lehman Brothers.</p> <p>Thain, who was previously the head of the New York Stock Exchange, joined Merrill in December with a mandate to steer the bank out of financial trouble. When he arrived, he was given a $15m signing on bonus. If he leaves in Bank of America's takeover, he stands to get a further $11m in accelerated stock payouts.</p> <p>Two former Goldman Sachs executives hired by Thain are likely to do even better. Merrill's head of global trading, Thomas Montag, who joined in August, has already received a $39m bonus. Together with stock options accelerated by a buyout, he could end the year with $76m. The bank's head of strategy, Peter Kraus, was given a $95m package including bonuses and stock awards to replace his generous compensation at Goldman when he joined in May, according to figures obtained by Bloomberg News.</p> <p>It is yet to be determined whether any of the trio will have a role at Bank of America. Even by the standards of Wall Street payouts, the sums are unusually high for such a short period of employment. </p> <p>Steven Hall, a New York-based executive remuneration expert, told the Guardian that Merrill had little choice but to honour the contracts: \"At the time they were recruiting [Thain], a negotiation took place and he would have told them this is what his price was. You can't go back and change things now - it's almost a kind of buyer's remorse we may be seeing.\"</p> <p>Thain, 53, is a leading fundraiser for the Republican presidential candidate John McCain. A doctor's son, he is an amateur beekeeper who used to keep hives in his back garden. He bought a two-bedroom apartment on New York's Park Avenue two years ago which had an asking price of $27.5m. He was hired by Merrill to steady the ship after huge losses on the credit markets which were run up under the leadership of ousted chief executive Stan O'Neal. At a press conference this week to announce the buyout by Bank of America, Thain admitted that selling Merrill was not the original plan: \"This isn't necessarily the outcome I would have expected when I took the job.\"</p> <p>He insisted that he had made progress in tidying up Merrill: \"We've been consistently cleaning up the balance sheet, repairing the damage that had been done over the last two or three years.\"</p> <p>Thain reportedly fought back tears at a meeting to brief staff on Merrill's buyout this week. Analysts say that Merrill's liabilities were greater than he could have anticipated when he joined - and some have praised his decision to sell.</p> <p>Defenders of Wall Street's controversial pay packages generally argue that although bankers do well during good times, they hold insecure jobs which are vulnerable during downturns.</p> <p>\"What we do see is that when times get tough, people lose their jobs - and that's the ultimate in pay cuts,\" said Hall.</p> <p>A Merrill Lynch spokesman said the bank would not comment on executive compensation beyond the statutory disclosures required in filings with regulators.</p>",

  "<p>Two imperatives point to the urgent development of renewable energy: security of supply and controlling climate change.</p> <p>Much the largest source of renewable energy is hydroelectric power, which provides 17% of world electricity (and 6% of world energy), about the same as nuclear power; both are CO2-free. All the other renewables - wind, wave, tidal, solar, biomass (which are either CO2-free or CO-neutral) - hardly feature in the statistics at the present time.</p> <p>In a desperate attempt to reduce dependence on the twin energy drugs of oil and gas, huge efforts are being made worldwide to develop renewable sources of energy, and the EU is committed to reaching a target of 20% renewable energy by 2020, which implies 35% to 40% renewable electricity.</p> <p>The UK is third from the bottom in the EU league table, just above Luxembourg and Malta, at 1.3% (the UK's 2020 target is 15%). Sweden gets a remarkable 40% of its energy from renewables.</p> <p>This form of energy is frequently invoked by the green lobby as being the only way ahead for electricity supply, providing all that we need. This must be a case of \"Omne ignotum pro magnifico est\" (\"That which is unknown is assumed to have great potential\", to quote Tacitus). </p> <p>But engineers do know a great deal about renewable energy: first and foremost, it is expensive, and is only being developed commercially because of the provision of subsidies of various kinds. This amounted to \u00a31bn last year and will gross up to more than 20 times this figure by 2020, according to the UK's Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. But this is currently seen as a necessary and acceptable cost for peace of mind in the fight to contain climate change, although the size of the subsidy is not always appreciated. </p> <p>A <a href=\"http://bit.ly/solarpayback\">recent report </a>by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors suggested that the payback time for solar panels is more than 100 years. Of course, as technologies mature and production gets under way, costs come down - but not always low enough to compete with hydro and nuclear. But they play a vital role in providing a source of CO2-free energy as part of the climate control portfolio of technologies.</p> <p>Solar energy is ubiquitous and gaining ground in niche markets but is also beginning to penetrate the bulk electricity market. High feed-in tariffs have allowed Germany to achieve its target of getting 100,000 roofs with solar panels generating 300 MW, a project that started in 1999 and finished in 2003. </p> <p>Wind power onshore has been successful because of marketing subsidies (the Renawables Obligation Certificates, which power generators pay to renewables operators); but even after 15 years it only provides the equivalent output of half a typical gas or nuclear station. The potential for more growth offshore is high; indeed, the government is relying on it, but someone will have to pay to hook the wind farms up to the grid. Wave and tidal stream systems are in their infancy but growing. </p> <p>The only large-scale supplier of renewable electricity would be the Severn Barrage, which is based on the proven technology demonstrated at the Rance barrage in Brittany, which has operated successfully for 40 years. It could provide 5% of UK electricity at a capital cost of \u00a31.7m per installed MW - about half of the cost of offshore wind farms.</p> <p>If a low-cost technology for storing renewable electricity could be found, it would solve the problems of intermittent wind and lack of night-time solar. A great deal of ingenuity is being brought to bear to increase renewable energy production and it is being steadily successful. But if we are to get to 15% renewable energy by 2020 it will be an expensive miracle. Any notion that renewables can provide for all our requirements is a mischievous and reckless boast that will leave us in the dark.</p> <p>\u00b7 Ian Fells is emeritus professor of energy conversion at Newcastle University and founding chairman of the <a href=\"http://www.narec.co.uk/\">New and Renewable Energy Centre </a>(NaREC) at Blyth, Northumberland.

  "<p>When an army confronts a heavily defended enemy, it has two options: <br>a full-frontal attack or a siege. In the \u00adbattle against climate change and its cause - the deeply entrenched \u00adprofligacy with which the world uses its fossil-fuel derived energy - there is a similar choice.</p> <p>The all-out attacks are mega-schemes to convert the Sahara into a giant solar energy farm, or supergrids \u00adconnecting renewable energy plants across \u00adcontinents. These are \u00addazzling, flashy proposals and gain much \u00adattention. \u00adGlobal geo-engineering plans are even more pulse-quickening, aimed as they are at changing the reflectivity of the entire planet. A \u00admillion space mirrors? Glitzy.</p> <p>Yet such spectacular attacks are high risk, easily turning into crashing, \u00adexpensive failures. Sieges, dull and monotonous, are the wise general's choice. And in the context of carbon dioxide emissions, the siege strategy equates to energy efficiency. That means switching stuff off, or building it to use less energy in the first place.</p> <p>I know, that is not dazzling; it's dreary. And yet this death-by-a-\u00admillion-cuts approach is one of our greatest hopes of preventing \u00adcatastrophic \u00adclimate change. A 2007 McKinsey report found that even implementing only those energy efficiency measures that pay for themselves at sensible rates of return could reduce the energy needed in 2020 by about a quarter. </p> <p>That would be halfway towards the emissions cuts that give a decent chance of limiting global warming to under 2C. A more homely example: if everyone in the UK bought the most efficient fridges, \u00adfreezers and washing machines, the \u00adcarbon saving would equal taking around 1.4 million cars off the road.</p> <p>From a policy perspective, the \u00adremedy is clear: minimum energy efficiency standards. But witness the intense lobbying from the car industry in the face of modest European fuel efficiency standards, and how the idea of charging a lower rate of VAT on more fuel-efficient white goods got rapidly bogged down. </p> <p>You can see the problem. \u00adProtesters are not going to take to the streets to demand more efficient fridges, but \u00adcorporates will lob large sums at \u00adprotecting a profitable status quo. Even last week's \u00a31bn home energy efficiency programme from the \u00adgovernment was driven by political fear, not global \u00adwarming. The \u00adofficial press release - from Defra - made not a single mention of carbon dioxide or climate change. </p> <p>There are glimmers of hope. \u00adFlagrantly wasteful incandescent bulbs are to become outlawed in some countries, with Australia leading the way. Japan's lack of domestic energy resources has forced it to tackle energy efficiency via impressive cultural change. Making it OK for salarymen to take off their jackets in the office means the air con can nudge up a couple of degrees. </p> <p>And there are a decent number of \u00adefficiency \u00adstandards in place from the US to Europe to China. But overall they are simply far too undemanding.<br>So how can energy efficiency come, as it must, to dominate every \u00addomestic and industrial setting? To put it \u00adsimply, it's got to be sexy. Frugality must give a frisson. </p> <p>The CleanTech 100, with its \u00adelectrochromic windows, magnetic fridges and plastic electronics, is a start.

  "<p>New secondary school buildings will have to reach a minimum standard of design quality or they will not be given the go-ahead, schools minister Jim Knight will announce today.</p> <p>A minimum threshold is to be applied to the \u00a345bn Building Schools for the Future (BSF) programme, which involves improving or rebuilding 3,500 secondary schools. Knight will say that students and teachers will join experts in schools architecture to vet designs before they are selected by local authorities. </p> <p>The new policy follows research, revealed by the Guardian in July, which shows an estimated eight out of 10 schools proposed under the programme are \"mediocre\" or \"not yet good enough\" according to the government's own design watchdog, the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (Cabe). </p> <p>Following a review of a sample of 40 designs, less than a fifth were considered to be good or excellent. Cabe discovered problems including bullying hotspots, noisy open-plan areas which make teaching difficult, and classrooms which are too dark or prone to overheating.</p> <p>Knight is expected to tell the annual conference of Partnerships for Schools (PfS), the body delivering the programme, that talks on how the vetting system will work are advanced and details will be finalised before January.</p> <p>\"We need to be clear at an early stage in a new school's design whether it is going to work for what we want,\" said Tim Byles, chief executive of PfS. \"That will allow time to develop another design so we don't waste resources.\"</p> <p>He added that plans need to demonstrate accessibility to the wider community, a design which will engage children and particularly those who struggle with education, the capability to adapt to new teaching practices such as large classes and advances in technology, and a high level of environmental sustainability.</p> <p>Under the new system, architects and builders will find their designs vetted while they are bidding for the job and any which fail to reach the threshold will be sent back to the drawing board. </p> <p>Byles said that would apply to designs rated lower than \"good\" on the current five-rung system of poor, mediocre, not yet good enough, good and excellent.</p> <p>Ken Shuttleworth, an architect and former partner of Lord Foster, who leads Cabe's design review panel, has said that only those proposals receiving an overall rating of excellent or good should be considered to be of an acceptable standard.</p> <p>BSF is a key New Labour programme and Gordon Brown has promised it will deliver schools that are \"the best equipped in the world for 21st-century learning\".</p> <p>So far 20 BSF deals, worth over \u00a32.5bn, have been signed by local authorities with the private sector, and 13 BSF schools are now open. </p> <p>By the end of 2008-09 a further 35 BSF schools will have opened and this will increase to around 200 every year from 2011 onwards.</p> <p>Barry Sheerman, chairman of the Commons select committee which is examining the BSF programme, said he was delighted ministers had decided to act. \"We have a unique opportunity to raise the quality of design in schools with BSF,\" he said. \"We just need to educate clients to the power of what design can do.\"</p>",
  "<p>Britain is trying to weaken European proposals to make governments and companies cut their carbon emissions by 2020 to tackle global warming, the Guardian has learned. Leaked documents show Britain wants Brussels to offset more domestic carbon savings through investment in clean projects in the developing world. </p> <p>The move would let firms and countries import more carbon credits to count against their pollution targets. It would allow Europe to make less effort to cut its pollution, while keeping it on course to meet an ambitious target of reducing carbon emissions by 20% by 2020. </p> <p>The government's own calculations show the proposed change would allow Europe to emit an extra billion tonnes of CO2 from 2013-2020.</p> <p>The move was condemned last night by environment campaigners, who accused the UK of trying to undermine efforts to get European industry to reduce emissions. </p> <p>Caroline Lucas, MEP and leader of the Green party, said: \"The British government is trying to buy its way out of climate change targets using unreliable credits from abroad. It shows how much of the political talk on climate is empty rhetoric, when you have the UK talking up the need for action on one hand, and carrying out this kind of irresponsible climate vandalism on the other.\"</p> <p>The change is described in a discussion paper prepared by the UK on possible amendments to the EU climate and energy package, a copy of which has been obtained by the Guardian. Dated August 8, the paper says: \"There are many good reasons why we should support increased access to project credits,\" and says the contribution of credits from schemes such as the UN's clean development mechanism (CDM) should be \"limited to 50% of absolute effort\". </p> <p>In other words, it wants to allow half of the targeted carbon savings to be achieved through imported credits. The original EC proposal set the limit at about a quarter.</p> <p>The UK position is confirmed in a separate briefing note sent to MEPs earlier this month.</p> <p>The credits would be bought using the CDM or similar carbon markets set up under the Kyoto protocol. </p> <p>Projects in the developing world that save carbon, such as technology to generate electricity from renewable sources, generate carbon credits, can then be bought by companies and used to notionally reduce their own emissions. </p> <p>Campaigners say the carbon credits are often unreliable and are no substitute for direct reductions. A US report earlier this year claimed between a third and two thirds of CDM credits did not reflect genuine carbon savings. </p> <p>Keith Allott of WWF said: \"Europe has a responsibility to help developing countries move onto a low-carbon pathway, but this cannot come at the expense of high emissions at home. We need to move beyond the idea of offset Europe.\"</p> <p>The proposal is the latest UK attempt to weaken the EC environmental package, which faces critical votes in Brussels next month. In July, the Guardian revealed how Britain wanted to block attempts to give renewable electricity sources priority access to electricity grids. The UK has also targeted the pledge to generate 20% of EU energy from renewable sources, with an attempt to make the target voluntary and to count projects abroad.</p>",

  "<p>The collapse of Lehman Brothers this week did not, broadly, meet with a warm and sympathetic response. City workers have regularly made headlines for their six-figure bonuses and correspondingly extravagant lifestyles, and the reaction to the news that thousands of them are now unemployed has provoked a degree of both anger and schadenfreude. Newspapers have talked of \"a decade of greed-filled hubris\" and \"greedy bungling\".</p> <p>It's understandable. The turbulence in the financial markets has left many of us wondering if we're heading for a 1930s-style depression, and worrying about how that will affect our own lives and dreams. It was less than two years ago that Lehman Brothers reported its \"most profitable year ever\", paying an average \u00a3170,933 bonus to staff members. But for every highly paid broker forced to trade in their second Lamborghini to keep up the mortgage payments on their central London flat, there will be a slew of secretaries, support staff, trainees and mid-ranking staff for whom the Lehman collapse may seem to spell disaster.</p> <p>For those people - and even for those who pull in the top salaries - I have good news. There is life outside the City and, although the wages are less generous, the trade-off in terms of happiness is well worth the move. </p> <p>I spent several years of my life working in the City. It is a well-trodden road for those who leave university with a good degree but without a clear idea of what to do next. Those \"milkround\" jobs - spun by glossy presentations given by charming young people at evening drinks in the university careers service - look enticing. For those who have been making ends meet on a student loan and occasional bar work, the salaries are particularly exciting; enough to pay off your loan in two or three years and, so the reasoning goes, if you can keep on living at your student level of expenditure, after 10 or 15 years you would have enough to retire on. Then, you will have time and money enough to focus on your dreams.</p> <p>Of course, it doesn't quite work out like this. Inevitably, there is lifestyle-creep. If you are working all hours - and City jobs do demand back in time what they give you in money - you really need to live close to the office, which is expensive. If you are in the office from 8am to 9pm most days, you need to let off steam at the end of a busy day, don't you? You don't have time to catch up with your uni friends, so your colleagues become your social circle. </p> <p>Someone suggests going out to an expensive restaurant for dinner; you don't want to be the miserly one claiming you can't afford it, so you agree. Soon you are dropping money for one meal that used to last you a month. And when someone suggests a team weekend skiing, you hardly want to be the party pooper, do you?</p> <p>Actually, that last part never happened to me; I can't ski and have no intention of learning. But I knew people to whom all of these things happened. People who ended their fifth year working in the City in more debt than when they arrived. I remember an acquaintance in his mid-20s telling me that his lifelong passion was baking. His plan, he said, was to retire at 50, live on the money he had saved and start an organic bakery as a retirement hobby. </p> <p>I wanted to grab him by the collar and say: \"Don't you realise that a bakery can be a business? A business that earns money, not a hobby? You don't have to wait 25 years to do what you really want - you can do it now!\" But by that point, I'd left the City, so perhaps I just didn't understand any more. </p> <p>One thing that remains clear to me is that there is a lot of unhappiness among City workers. It's a tough environment, legendarily sexist but also simply brutal, in terms of hours, expected performance, and the penalties for failure. Some people thrive in environments like this; others crumble. Several times, I knocked on an office door to find a colleague inside in tears or close to it. Breakdowns happen, suicides are not unknown.</p> <p>For me, the end - or the beginning of the end - came almost exactly seven years ago. I was on secondment in Manhattan, at my desk at 8.45am one Tuesday in September when two planes flew into the World Trade Centre. People forget, now, that on that day we didn't know how many planes were coming. The television reported that 50 were missing, heading for every city in America. As we waited through that long and shuddering day it became clear to me that my life could not continue as it had done. My job wasn't evil or wrong, on some days it was even enjoyable, but it wasn't the life I dreamed of and suddenly that wasn't enough. </p> <p>I left my job, came back to England, enrolled on an MA in creative writing and began to work on a novel; an \"unrealistic\" goal I'd had since I was a teenager. It's worked out better than I could ever have hoped. So, seven years and one week later, to those who now find themselves at the centre of a more minor cataclysm, or to anyone at a crossroads in their life, I say: if you don't love your job with a passion, now is the time to take flight. It is the start of a new academic year; with a bit of luck you might get yourself a late place on the MA or vocational course you always longed to take. Or maybe you can wangle a small business loan for that organic bakery. Not only is it not too late, it's not too early either.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This week Naomi saw Man On Wire: \"The breathtaking story of a true artist, Philippe Petit, who, in 1974, walked across a high-wire between the towers of the World Trade Centre.\" She played On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness: \"An hilarious steampunk game with gorgeous visuals, by the creators of the Penny Arcade online comic.\"</p>",
  "<p>The scale of the crisis engulfing the global financial system can no longer be in doubt. The events of the past few days have confirmed that we are living through the greatest meltdown since the Wall Street crash of 1929. For the second time in barely a week, an avowedly free market government in the citadel of laissez-faire capitalism has been forced to nationalise a linchpin of American finance - this time the world's biggest insurance company, AIG - in an effort to prevent the toxin of collapse spreading further through the US economy. </p> <p>That followed hard on the heels of the nationalisation of the mortgage giants Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae; the bankruptcy of the country's fourth largest investment bank, Lehman Brothers - corroded by bad debt and bonus-fuelled speculation - and the forced takeover of Merrill Lynch. And a year after the credit crunch triggered the fatal run on Northern Rock, British high street retail banks are being sucked into the crisis: at one point yesterday the country's largest mortgage lender, HBOS, had lost almost 70% of its share value since the start of the week.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the impact on the real economy is becoming stronger: output in Britain is falling and official unemployment is likely to rise above 2 million next year - the real figure will be significantly higher. More than 100,000 jobs are expected to go in finance alone. The only question is how deep and prolonged the recession will now be. </p> <p>What is certain is that the dominance of the free-market model of capitalism, which has held sway across the world for more than two decades, is rapidly coming to an end. When its high priests in Washington are forced to carry out the largest nationalisations ever undertaken outside the communist world, while intervening on an unprecedented scale across markets that were supposed to be self-regulating in order to keep the system afloat, the neoliberal order is transparently falling apart. </p> <p>Naturally, market fundamentalists and ideologues will continue to preach the old religion. The Times argued yesterday that the unfolding of the banking crisis showed that capitalism and markets were working, however \"brutal and unforgiving\" that might sound. Such otherworldly dogma is not a luxury candidates standing for election can afford - and even John McCain felt obliged this week to attack Wall Street's \"casino [of] greed, corruption of excess\", while Barack Obama blamed McCain's economic philosophy of deregulation and called for wide-ranging reform.</p> <p>That is exactly what should be happening in Britain. But instead, across the main political parties, there is a striking and continuing failure to face up to the extent of the economic crisis or the sea change in policy it must herald. Britain's political class appears to be wedded to the politics of the 1990s and the glory days of neoliberalism, clinging to the economic legacy of Thatcherism and unable to make the shift from deregulation to intervention that the times demand.</p> <p>The government has the most to gain and least to lose by doing so. But it's hamstrung by Gordon Brown's paralysing caution and New Labour's original Blairite embrace of market ideology, private provision and corporate privilege. When Alistair Darling declared on Tuesday that he was \"extremely anxious\" about speculative manipulation of the markets, he invited the obvious question of what on earth he plans to do about it - and why he and Brown insisted on the \"light-touch regulation\" that created the destructive derivative whirligig in the first place.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrats could be capitalising on the early warnings from Vince Cable, their new superhero, about the debt crisis and his calls for the public ownership of Northern Rock. But instead of building on the tradition of Keynes and Lloyd George, their leader Nick Clegg has chosen this of all moments to orchestrate a symbolic return to economic liberalism, forcing through a commitment to cut both taxation and spending. </p> <p>The issue is not, of course, the Lib Dems' welcome proposals to redistribute the tax burden from the low to the high paid - it's the new plan to pay for extra tax cuts by reducing the overall level of public expenditure. Not only are spending cuts the last thing the economy needs as it sinks into recession. But underpinning the new policy is Clegg's personal ideological conviction that state intervention is dead - exactly the opposite of what is required in the face of the storms now sweeping away the neoliberal nostrums of the past.</p> <p>It also gives political cover to David Cameron's parallel enthusiasm for a smaller state, backed up by more charity provision for the poor. Much has been made of the Tories' latter-day conversion to social liberalism, their new enthusiasm for fairness and their self-proclaimed \"progressive\" agenda. Certainly, their rhetoric is a long way from the confrontational style of the Thatcher era - even if the word \"progressive\" has, as the social democratic sage David Marquand argues, been largely gutted of any meaning. </p> <p>But when it comes to the core social and economic choices, all the signs are that Cameron's Tories plan to follow precisely the same agenda of corporate privilege, deregulation, privatisation of public services and low taxes for the rich inherited from his Conservative predecessors via Tony Blair. Already George Osborne is moving away from his commitment to stick to Labour's spending plans, while Cameron has declared that redistribution of wealth and income is an \"approach that has run out of road\".</p> <p>But that agenda is precisely the model that has delivered today's financial breakdown. And as a result, the leaders of the party expected to win the next general election - tied as they are to City and corporate interests - have even less to say about the crisis carving a swathe through finance and the wider economy, and what to do about it, than Brown and his unfortunate chancellor. Beyond calling for better bank deposit protection, Osborne seems to be utterly at sea.</p> <p>This all represents a woeful failure of institutional politics. But it is also a gift to anyone prepared to push a new agenda that breaks with the failed market orthodoxy and faces up to the reality of our times: that only decisive public intervention and regulation can begin to deal with the economic - or, for that matter, environmental - crises we face. For any Labour politician thinking of standing against the prime minister, that has to be the starting point.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:s.milne@theguardian.com\">s.milne@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Tuesday, 11.30pm, all the lights were off in my house, my boyfriend had gone to bed, and I sat watching the highlights of the Paralympics, recorded earlier that day. The footage of the men's wheelchair basketball was on, a fierce battle for bronze between the US and UK, and as it unfolded, I found myself leaning closer and closer to the screen, until I finally let out a loud, involuntary yelp and upended my glass of cranberry juice. \"What is it?\" called my boyfriend, anxiously, from upstairs. \"Do you need me to come down?\" \"No,\" I shouted. \"I'm fine. Jon Pollock just scored his third three-pointer, right on the whistle!\"</p> <p>It was a stunning point from the British captain, and his team went on to win that match, trouncing the US, the world number ones. Coming towards the end of the Paralympics, it was another in a long line of eye-popping moments. </p> <p>Overall, the past six weeks in Beijing has produced a fascinating variety of human stories; people blasting from near-obscurity to capture the public consciousness. A massive range of talent emerged at the Olympics - Rebecca Adlington in the pool, Christine Ohuruogu on the track, Chris Hoy in the velodrome. And the Paralympics have been no different. </p> <p>During the past two weeks we've seen 13-year-old swimmer Eleanor Simmonds become Britain's youngest individual medallist, winning two gold medals in the 100m and 400m freestyle, and winning over audiences up and down the country too, by doing exactly what any teenager would do in the circumstances - bursting into ecstatic, overwhelmed tears. We've seen South African Oscar Pistorius dominate the male athletics, and Chantal Petitclerc do the same in the women's events - the 38-year-old Canadian winning five gold medals, to take her lifetime total to 14. The equestrian Lee Pearson won three gold medals, taking his lifetime tally to nine, and proved as entertaining off his horse as on; talking to the BBC's Clare Balding on Tuesday night, he said the secret of his success was \"a great backside\".</p> <p>And then there is Liz Johnson. Watching her being interviewed by Balding, I found myself crying. This was not because of her disability; the athletes at the Paralympics naturally flinch at the idea of being seen as heroic, or special, or having \"triumphed over tragedy\". They are athletes, doing what athletes tend to enjoy doing: competing at the very highest level. But Johnson's story would have been inspiring whatever the backdrop. On arrival in Beijing, Johnson learned that her mother, who had been diagnosed with terminal cancer, had died while she was travelling. \"I think in a strange way she probably timed it that way,\" she told Balding, \"because if she'd died earlier I wouldn't have come, and if she'd died later I would have gone home.\" Johnson went on to win gold in the 100m breaststroke and she and her boyfriend Jody Cundy were named the golden couple of the Paralympics. Cundy won two track cycling golds, and, like all the athletes at the event, his performance challenged the very notion of disability: his time in the men's 1km equalled that of the riders in the 1984 Olympics.</p> <p>All in all, it has been a stunning competition, and while the coverage certainly hasn't had the wall-to-wall intensity of the Olympics, it has been strongly presented, in a nightly 7pm primetime BBC slot. I'm pretty sure that anyone who started watching the events will have gone back for more - the quality of the sport, and the intensity of will was such that, once you switched on it was very difficult to turn away (as I thought ruefully, while wiping up that cranberry juice). </p> <p>In fact, as one colleague of mine said, after a few evenings' viewing, it was so good that it had brought the general invisibility of disabled people on screen and in the media crashing home to her. Every four years comes a two-week period in which we see disability on screen - a partial representation, of course, since by no means all disabled people are remotely interested in sport, and people with learning disabilities are shamefully excluded - but a strong representation nonetheless. And then, once it has finished, what follows? Next to nothing.</p> <p>This invisibility is significant, because of the way it affects the disabled population at large. Representation is a form of respect, and also of acceptance; the more visible people are, the less prejudice they are likely to attract, and the more likely they are to have the freedom to pursue what they want - to find jobs that suit them, to move happily through their immediate environment, to simply be an integral part of the community. At the moment, many disabled people simply don't have this freedom. It's estimated that there are 10 million people with disabilities in Britain, with 44% of adults over the age of 50 having a disability. Only about half of adult disabled people are in work - compared with 80% of non-disabled people of working age - and this contributes to the high levels of poverty that many face. </p> <p>As Suzanne Stevenson of Scope points out, the Disability Discrimination Act makes it unlawful for employers to discriminate on the grounds of disability, yet \"disabled people are vastly under-represented in the UK workforce. There are an estimated 1 million disabled people who want to work but who face significant barriers preventing them, such as physical inaccessibility, and also negative attitudes from employers and colleagues.\"</p> <p>So why is it that we don't see more disabled people on screen and in the media? Colin Barnes, professor of disability studies at the University of Leeds, flags up a study conducted in 2003, which suggests that the problem lies with media organisations - viewers said that they would be perfectly happy to see more disabled people in the public eye. The report, Disabling Prejudice, was commissioned by the BBC, among others, and found that 79% of television viewers would not mind if a disabled person read the main evening news; the majority of respondents (61%) felt there should be more portrayals of disabled people on television in a wide variety of roles. And yet, such representation remains extremely rare. In fact, it was recently reported that the BBC had had to make a five-figure payout to one of its veteran reporters, Gary O'Donoghue, who is blind, after a story he had uncovered as the duty reporter on the late shift at Westminster was handed to another reporter to present on the Ten O'clock News. It was said that the programme's deputy editor, Daniel Pearl, wanted a \"proper political correspondent\" on screen.</p> <p>Barnes feels that representation hasn't increased much since the early 90s, when he wrote a report saying that \"cultural representations of disability or disabled people are the bedrock on which institutional discrimination rests. And until you really take that seriously,\" he says, \"and the majority of the media don't, then you're never going to change attitudes.\"</p> <p>There has been some movement on this issue recently, but it has been controversial. More and more disabled people have been showing up on reality TV shows. Pete Bennett, who has Tourette's, won Big Brother, and the last series of that same show featured Mikey Hughes, who is blind. There was a recent episode of Wife Swap, featuring Penny Hefferan, a blind mother of two, and, of course, Britain's Missing Top Model, in which the eight contestants, all of whom have some form of disability, competed to appear on the pages of Marie Claire.</p> <p>Among disabled people, this shift in coverage provokes hugely divergent opinions. The journalist Rebecca Atkinson has spoken out strongly in support of such programming, writing in 2006 that Big Brother is \"light and comic, but perhaps the most interesting thing is its capacity, through prolonged broadcast exposure, to strip down caricatures to reveal the real person underneath ... Watching Bennett offers the closest experience to real-life disability that you'll get.\" Ian Macrae, editor of Disability Now, who has spent most of his career in broadcasting, is also sanguine about the development. The next issue of the magazine features Mikey Hughes, and he sees this Big Brother casting and shows like Britain's Missing Top Model as \"just another move towards having more disabled people on telly\".</p> <p>Barnes is more scathing. He's not a big fan of TV in general, and intensely dislikes the way that disabled people are stereotyped - the marvelling over athletic achievements in the Paralympics, for instance, which he calls the \"supercrip\" stereotype. \"Not to be cynical,\" he says, \"but isn't Big Brother the modern freak show? Isn't it obvious that you're going to have disabled people in there? The freak show was an abhorrence, and so we banned it - but just think about what still appears on television. The programme, Extraordinary People, for example, where you get people making an issue out of a person's abnormality or difference. There was something on last night - a documentary featuring a child with two faces, and I didn't watch it, because I find that kind of stuff so upsetting. I've always been visually impaired, and of course non-disabled people can't possibly understand how it feels to be a disabled person when we say we feel ridiculed - when we point out Ronnie Barker stuttering [in Open All Hours], or Colonel Blink. I watched a news broadcast last night and they were talking about screening for Down's syndrome, about people not wanting these babies, in front of a child who had Down's syndrome. Now, I'm sorry, but if you have Down's syndrome - and let's be honest, Down's syndrome people are like everybody else, there are those with serious learning difficulties, and others who are comparable to non-disabled people - how the hell does that make you feel?\"</p> <p>The holy grail for disability activists, says Macrae, would be one of three things: a good, compelling disabled character in a soap; a disabled Blue Peter presenter; or a disabled newsreader. The reason that we haven't yet reached this high watermark, he thinks, is that there simply aren't enough disabled people being employed in television. There is a story he regularly tells about the Blind Date producers realising that they had very few black contestants, deciding to employ a number of black researchers, and finding that their representation problem disappeared overnight. The BBC used to have the Disability Programmes Unit (DPU), which had a strong disabled staff, but Macrae says this was disbanded in 2000, and although said staff were expected to find other jobs in television, \"so-called mainstream programme makers just didn't know what to do with them. And so they all ended up taking the money and going.\"</p> <p>He illustrates the positive affects of having disabled people working in TV with another story, of a woman from the DPU who went to work on Blue Peter as an assistant producer: \"She immediately started making items for the show, and I saw her a few months in and asked how it was going. 'Fantastic,' she said. 'I've even managed to get a few disabled kids on the show.' And I said, 'What, like talking about their disability?' 'No, just as contributors.' I said, 'Oh, right, and how have they reacted at BP?' And she said, 'Actually, I don't think anybody's even noticed'.\" He pauses. \"And that, to me, says it all. That's someone who's said, 'I'll get these kids, I'll sort out their access requirements before the event, and nobody's even going to notice that they're there or think that they're a problem.' And suddenly you've got inclusive television.\"</p> <p>The problem is that of chicken and egg - until disabled people are represented more generally, on screen, in the media, in society at large - they are less likely to find the employment that they want. All the people I spoke to recognised that the issues of representing disabled people on screen were complicated by negative stereotypes and prejudices, but simply wanted their ordinary lives, and their everyday problems, to be represented. Macrae asks why disabled people are never interviewed for general news stories, for example: \"If news is covering something like the credit crunch, then why aren't they talking to disabled people who are going to be affected by the credit crunch?\" And Barnes points out that when Coronation Street did have a character who used a wheelchair, \"she used to float around Coronation Street as if there were no steps\". </p> <p>The Paralympics is all very well - and in many ways it's brilliant - but it is a quick and very partial representation of disabled people. Barnes would like to see much more respect paid to the day-to-day life of those with disabilities. \"Disabled people are ordinary, they're no different to anybody else. You'll be disabled before you die, we all will, and disabled people are the biggest minority in the country, yet none of this is reflected in the media.\" He pauses. \"And it's about time it was\".</p>",

  "<p>Linking the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean, the blue waters of the Gulf of Aden are one of the most important trading routes in the world. They are also the most feared.</p> <p>Far from the romantic villains of Hollywood legend, brutal pirates are terrorising congested shipping lanes and oceans from the South China Sea to the Gulf of Guinea. Their targets are not dead men's treasure chests but ships and their crew, who they can hold to ransom, demanding - and getting - sums of up to $1m.</p> <p>The Gulf of Aden, close to the Somali coastline, is the real piracy hotspot, however, with more than 50 attacks on ships in or near the gulf so far this year, up from just 13 in 2007.</p> <p>Based on at least three elusive \"mother ships\" believed to be Russian-made trawlers and a tugboat, bands of pirates fan out in fast, inflatable boats and fire rocket-propelled grenades at their victims. The latest hijack of a retired couple aboard the 50ft yacht Carr\u00e9 d'As (Four Aces) was only foiled when French special forces in night-vision goggles dropped by parachute into waters nearby. The couple were rescued, six pirates were seized and one was shot dead. Extraordinarily, Somali pirates are currently holding hostage 10 other vessels and 221 crew members.</p> <p>The surge in attacks has come despite a new UN security council resolution allowing naval vessels to enter Somalia's territorial waters and repress piracy \"by all necessary means\". EU foreign ministers this week agreed to coordinate warship patrols off the Somali coast but the International Maritime Bureau still wants the international community to take \"a more proactive approach\". French president Nicolas Sarkozy has also hinted other countries are not doing enough. \"The world cannot accept this,\" he declared. \"I call on the other countries of the world to assume their responsibilities, as France has done.\"</p> <p>Andrew Linnington of the maritime union Nautilus says piracy has got worse because successful demands for large ransoms have inspired \"copycat\" attacks. Linnington argues that ship owners are not doing enough to protect their vessels and crew and must invest in better alarm systems, CCTV, electric fences on ships and, in some cases, armed guards. It is not just seafarers who are put in peril. Some 3.3m barrels of crude oil - almost 4% of daily global demand - are transported through the Gulf of Aden each day. Linnington warns that if the hijacking of a big oil tanker goes wrong there could be an environmental catastrophe. \"It is more by luck than anything else that we haven't had a major disaster yet,\" he says.</p>",
  "<p>The west's efforts to use the United Nations to promote its values and shape the global agenda are failing, according to a detailed study published yesterday.</p> <p>A sea change in the balance of power in favour of China, India, Russia and other emerging states is wrecking European and US efforts to entrench human rights, liberties and multilateralism. Western policies in crisis regions as diverse as Georgia, Zimbabwe, Burma or the Balkans are suffering serial defeats in what the study identifies as a protracted trend.</p> <p>The haemorrhaging of western power, as reflected in longer-term voting patterns in key UN bodies, is mirrored by the increasing clout of China, Russia and the Islamic world, according to an audit of European influence at the UN by the European Council on Foreign Relations.</p> <p>\"The EU is suffering a slow-motion crisis at the UN,\" says the report, noting that the west is now being regularly outwitted in global diplomatic poker by the Chinese and Russians. \"The problem is fading power to set the rules. The UN is increasingly being shaped by China, Russia and their allies ... The west is in disarray. The EU's rifts with the US on many human rights issues at the UN in the Bush era have weakened both.\"</p> <p>US and European failure to win the day at the UN security council in recent votes on Zimbabwe and Burma as well as defeats last year on Kosovo or Darfur and the constant struggle to muster support for global action against Iran because of its nuclear ambitions are traced as part of a broader decline over the past decade.</p> <p>Using a programme designed to analyse voting patterns and statistics, the thinktank found that European policies on human rights enjoyed the support of 72% of UN members a decade ago but only 48% by last year, while the US suffered a steeper collapse from 77% to 30%.</p> <p>\"The pattern of votes in the general assembly shows that opposition to the EU is growing, spurred by a common resistance to European efforts at promoting human rights,\" said the study.</p> <p>The beneficiaries of this disaffection with the west have been China and Russia, which defend national sovereignty and non-intervention in sovereign countries no matter how grievous the atrocities and human rights violations blamed on national governments. Over the past decade support for Chinese and Russian stances on human rights issues has soared from less than 50% to 74% in the UN general assembly.</p> <p>The assembly kicked off this week in New York with the west bracing itself for another debacle. Serbia is to use the session to demand a vote on the \"illegality\" of the secession last February of Kosovo, whose breakaway was strongly backed by the US and most of the EU, and to refer the dispute to the UN's international court of justice. Despite strenuous lobbying by the Europeans to prevent the vote, they have conceded defeat. Only 46 of the 192 UN states have recognised Kosovo's independence. And western attempts to rally support for Georgia in the Caucasus crisis will be rebuffed by the Russians.</p> <p>\"The EU has collectively failed to adapt to new power trends,\" said Martti Ahtisaari, the former Finnish president and a chairman of the thinktank.</p> <p>The setbacks for the west at the UN in New York are compounded by a worse record in winning the battles for rights and freedoms at the Geneva-based UN Human Rights Council. In March the Islamic bloc changed the mandate for the council's rapporteur on freedom of expression, charging him, in the wake of the Danish cartoons crisis, with the obligation to record blasphemy. Critics said the post was supposed to function as an agent of liberty, but became an instrument of repression. </p> <p>\"The head of steam building up in the Islamic world for worldwide defamation legislation is huge,\" said Keith Porteous-Wood, director of Britain's National Secular Society. \"The Human Rights Council can no longer serve a useful purpose.\"</p> <p>In the council's two-year existence, the 19 European countries on the 47-strong body have been marginalised, mired in despair and a sense of futility after losing more than half the votes conducted.</p> <p>The poor European record on winning the world's hearts and minds contrasts with Brussels' habit of talking up the merits of its \"soft power\" attractiveness, and indicates that the EU's huge financial investment in being the world's biggest aid donor and the UN's biggest funder is not translating into political gains.</p>",
  "<p>It was only a decade ago that Tzipi Livni decided to become a politician. She had served as a young agent in Israel's foreign secret service, the Mossad, and then gave up an agency career to become a commercial lawyer until one autumn holiday, not long after the signing of the Oslo peace accords with the Palestinians, she decided to step into politics. Now she is just weeks away from becoming Israel's next prime minister after winning a striking victory in her Kadima party's leadership election yesterday.</p> <p>Livni, who is 50 and married with two sons, has been long tipped as a future leader and in recent months emerged as more dovish than many in her party. On the Palestinian front she advocates a two-state, negotiated settlement, though she adamantly resists any prospect of a return for Palestinian refugees into what is now Israel. On Iran and its nuclear ambitions she favours a tightening of sanctions, but seems less eager than other leading politicians for an outright military confrontation.</p> <p>Yet her background is more firmly embedded in Israel's right-wing. She was born into a \"fighting family\" and one that is much respected in Israel. Her father, Eitan Livni, was a senior figure in the Irgun, the underground militant Zionist movement that fought the British before the creation of the state. When she turned to politics, she turned naturally to the Likud, the leading rightist party.</p> <p>But three years ago she followed the then prime minister and Likud leader, Ariel Sharon, when he left the party, created his own movement, Kadima, or Forward. He argued that the dream of a Greater Israel from the Mediterranean to the River Jordan was unachievable and that the land should be shared with a Palestinian state. The creation of that Palestinian state is still a distant prospect, but many argue Livni is committed to a two-state solution to the seemingly intractable Middle East conflict.</p> <p>Avraham Diskin, a political scientist at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, said Livni was more dovish than her challengers for the party leadership. \"Ideologically everybody is now in the centre, people realise the risk and want to have peace and pay the price but the difference is in the nuances,\" he said. \"But she is emotionally involved, not just ideologically, she is very interested and she is a believer.\"</p> <p>Livni has been Israel's lead negotiator in the current talks with the Palestinians which began in Annapolis, in the United States, in November last year. With Livni as prime minister those talks could be expected to continue, perhaps even with a successful result. \"With her there is a chance of a conclusion, of having a piece of paper. What happens after that is difficult. But she is very highly motivated,\" Diskin said.</p> <p>However, the prospect of a peace agreement will depend just as heavily on the outcome of the US presidential elections. Even following a year of talks there are precious few signs of progress on the ground on the core issues and much evidence that the situation is slowly worsening.</p> <p>Livni herself made it clear just last month that she would not be rushed into a deal. \"I think that any attempt to bridge gaps that maybe it's premature to bridge, or to reach something that is not the comprehensive agreement that we want to reach can lead to doing it wrong just because of the pressure,\" she said.</p> <p>But before there can be negotiations, Livni must first form a coalition government. She will meet with Shimon Peres, the Israeli president, this week and he will give her 42 days to bring onside enough allied parties to form a majority in the Knesset, or parliament. Kadima has 29 seats in the 120-seat Knesset and will need Labour's 19 seats as well as other smaller parties, whose support will be more difficult to secure. There is likely to be a long period of back-room negotiating that will test Livni's skill before a deal is done and which may demand compromises that later limit her ability to strike a deal with the Palestinians.</p> <p>She will also be operating in an intensely male environment, where military experience is often as highly regarded as political acumen. She has already had to fight off suggestions she might be too weak for the job. \"The fact that I'm a woman doesn't make me a weak leader,\" she told the Jerusalem Post last week. \"It's not that generals pull the trigger and women don't. I have no problem pulling the trigger when necessary.\"</p> <p>One of her greatest challenges will be to restore some integrity to the tainted Israeli political system. She has a rare, corruption-free, \"Mrs Clean\" reputation, but will have an uphill battle to restore the public's faith in her colleagues.

  "<p>Russell Simmons is in reflective mood. The 50-year-old music mogul, fashion entrepreneur, community activist, jeweller and philanthropist is frequently portrayed as somewhat self-absorbed. Perhaps it's the fast-approaching appointment with his London yoga teacher, or maybe he is just tired at the end of a day of radio appearances and networking that followed an overnight flight from his native New York this morning; but as he sits in a loose-fitting, upmarket T-shirt, his trademark baseball cap in place, sipping black tea in a Knightsbridge hotel, the hustler and huckster credited with turning hip-hop from a New York street-music scene to a multi-billion-dollar global industry is oozing humility.</p> <p>\"I don't spend any time thinking about my place in history, ever,\" he says. \"If people say I changed things, it's nice, and I take it - but if I could give it to a charity it would be useful. I really believe now that my only job in life is to achieve a state of comfort and happiness. I'm still fearful, I'm still separated, I'm still disconnected from myself, you know? But I believe if you go to work on it every day, baby steps mean something.\"</p> <p>Simmons is in London to introduce his Def Comedy Jam to the UK via a short series of gigs. He dutifully plugs the tour, which features five up-and-coming black comedians, and the brand, which, in its live and TV incarnations in the US, helped launch the careers of stars including Chris Rock, Bernie Mac and Chris Tucker. But, as befits the businessman whose restless energy earned him the teenage nickname \"Rush\", he is unable to stick to one topic for long. Amid freeform discourses on several current projects - trying to run an ethical diamond business; working to improve relations between America's blacks, Jews and Muslims; providing a range of financial products to empower the poor; launching a clothing brand inspired by what Barack Obama would wear \"if it was up to him\" - he offers the occasional insight into what makes him tick.</p> <p>\"It's just part of an ongoing, you know, service,\" he offers. \"You give what you've got, and I have access. So it's like kinda you have to do it - you have it, so that's why you do it.\"</p> <p>A small-time weed dealer in the New York borough of Queens, Simmons' life was changed when he encountered hip-hop at a club in 1977. Savvy enough to realise that his talents lay not in performance but promotion, he became a manager. His first client, Kurtis Blow, was the first rapper to sign with a major record label, and he oversaw the career of his brother Joe's group, Run DMC, whose 1986 collaboration with Aerosmith, Walk This Way, was instrumental in turning rap into a hugely profitable genre worldwide.</p> <p>With the rock-fan-turned-rap-producer Rick Rubin, Simmons founded Def Jam. Hip-hop's best-known imprint, it provided a home for artists such as Public Enemy, LL Cool J and the Beastie Boys, and, fuelled by Simmons' inspired mix of showmanship and entrepreneurial flair, played a critical role in broadening the music's audience beyond its predominantly black New York roots. Before anyone else, Simmons saw how pervasive this street culture could become, and over the past three decades he has constantly managed to position himself at the points where hip-hop meets the mainstream - whether in music, fashion, business or politics.</p> <p>\"I've always been a bridge,\" he says in the middle of a lengthy explanation-cum-defence of his controversial involvement with the diamond giant De Beers, but the observation seems to apply just as aptly to every other area of his life and work. \"I spoke at a jewellery convention,\" he recalls of a recent event in the US, \"and there were no African Americans at all - not one - among these 2,000 people. But that's the jewellery business: tight-ass, the way the fashion business was when I got in it. When I started in fashion, there was nobody [of a similar background] in it, and now if you go to the department [stores] where I'm sold, you will see 15 other [black-owned or designed] brands. Before Run DMC, on MTV there were no black people at all, except Michael Jackson. And he had his nose broke and his hair straightened, so he didn't really express the kinds of things the rappers got to talk about.\"</p> <p>In the mid-90s, with hip-hop a global youth culture, Simmons diversified, launching the streetwear range Phat Farm and inaugurating the Def Comedy Jam - brands with strong connections to the hip-hop style and attitude he had been the first to commodify. Never one to undersell himself - he had appeared on a track on LL Cool J's 1985 debut album, sending himself up as a caricature of a money-hungry svengali - Simmons was a bigger name than many of the artists he worked with. In 1998 he married his long-time girlfriend, the model Kimora Lee, and began to count the likes of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton as friends.</p> <p>He sold his remaining shares in Def Jam in 2003, continuing as chairman for some time, but has now ceased all involvement in the label. He does not believe that the music business, in its current period of directionless turmoil, is one he would choose to get into were he 20 years old today. \"But that's using my brain,\" he cautions. </p> <p>\"I don't use my brain about the creative thing. From a business standpoint, I instinctively do things: when I get something right, it's never because I use my brain. People are afraid of failure - they don't like to work so hard and have people keep saying, 'No.' I think that's what people fear most. I'm not that afraid, obviously, 'cos I stay on something and keep pushing until there's absolutely no hope.\"</p> <p>Indeed, for all the successes, Simmons has chalked up a number of missteps. His relationships with artists have sometimes been fractious: the Beastie Boys left Def Jam following their spectacularly successful debut LP over money arguments with Simmons, who was both label owner and manager. After severing ties with Def Jam in 1999, Public Enemy's Chuck D took to calling his former label boss \"Hustler Scrimmons\" in blog postings. And in 2007 Simmons was strongly criticised for pronouncing the diamond trade clean after visiting Botswanan diamond mines as a guest of De Beers, which supplies stones for Simmons' jewellery line.</p> <p>He remains affably unconcerned, claiming to have \"repaired [his] friendship\" with the Beasties while admitting that he was not \"talented or sensitive enough to manage [his] way through\" the band's stay on Def Jam. He states that Public Enemy remain his all-time favourite artists and argues that his investment in a South African meditation school, and the pressure he can bring to bear through his personal relationship with De Beers chairman Nicky Oppenheimer, means that his involvement in the diamond business is a force for positive change.</p> <p>In his personal life, too, there have been highs and lows. His marriage ended in divorce and recent tabloid reports have confirmed the end of his relationship with another model, Porschia Coleman.</p> <p>\"I don't know where my Tony is,\" he chuckles, referring to the Broadway award he won in 2003 for the Def Poetry Jam. \"I think my ex-wife got it. She got a lot of shit!\" Including custody of the pair's two children, Ming, eight, and Aoki, six, towards whose upkeep Simmons has to pay a reported $40,000 a month. \"I'd rather she had full custody of the kids because she's great with 'em,\" he says. \"But, shit, I have a pretty easy life - and those details [that appear in the press], the worst of 'em are not so bad, I don't think. I'm not a priest, or a yogi - I don't have any kind of issues with the way I'm living.</p> <p>\"That's the thing about practising yoga,\" he concludes. \"You smile at every pose, no matter how difficult, and that's the practice in life. You practise polishing up the pose, and sometimes you smile even though it hurts, right? You keep smiling, the bones get aligned, and eventually you like the pose\".</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Russell Simmons Presents Def Comedy Jam at London Brixton Academy on Saturday</p>",
  "<p>The Google-owned video sharing website YouTube has moved to counter criticism that it helps fuel gang violence by introducing new rules to ban submissions that glamorise guns and knives. </p> <p>The UK-specific rule will ban videos \"showing weapons with the aim of intimidation\" after criticism that fierce battles were being fuelled by rival members posting videos. </p> <p>Last summer the Guardian revealed how videos on YouTube displayed the \"barely concealed culture of violent gangs glorying in crime\" in the area of Liverpool where 11-year-old Rhys Jones was shot dead. </p> <p>In July the culture, media and sport select committee criticised the website, on to which 10 hours of video are uploaded every minute, for not protecting users enough from the \"dark side\" of internet content. </p> <p>A Google spokesman said: \"There has been particular concern over videos in the UK that involve showing weapons with the aim of intimidation, and this is one of the areas we are addressing.\" </p> <p>The move comes days after YouTube also introduced new global guidelines to outlaw content that \"directly incites violence\". In a blog post to users late last week it said: \"We realise it's not always obvious where we draw the line on content that's acceptable to upload. We've updated the community guidelines ... included in the update are a few new things to steer clear of, like not directly inciting violence.\"</p> <p>Other existing rules relate to the posting of videos that show violence and include \"hate speech\". But the new rules will not change the internet giant's stance on the way content is regulated. </p> <p>It is committed to a policy of user-moderation, arguing it is impractical for it to vet every video before it is posted. Once a video is flagged up as potentially inappropriate YouTube's staff examine it and remove it if it breaks the guidelines. </p> <p>The media select committee, chaired by John Whittingdale, the Tory MP for Maldon and East Chelmsford, had called on video sharing sites to undertake a \"proactive review of content\" to \"quarantine\" material until it was deemed suitable to be posted. </p> <p>But Google said such an approach was impractical. \"YouTube is a community site used by millions of people in very positive ways. Sadly, as with any form of communication, a tiny minority of people will try to break the rules,\" said a spokesman. </p> <p>\"When users see content they think is inappropriate they can flag it. If the content breaks our terms we aim to remove it quickly and if a user repeatedly breaks the rules we will disable their account.\" </p> <p>The site, bought by Google for $1.65bn (\u00a392m) in 2006 just 18 months after it launched, has faced consistent criticism on both sides of the Atlantic over some of the videos posted by its huge user base. </p> <p>As well as unsuitable or offensive videos, copyright holders have complained that their material is being posted without their permission. The media giant Viacom and the English Premier League are among those who have launched legal action against what they see as copyright infringement on a grand scale. </p> <p>Here too, YouTube argues that it takes videos down as soon as they are flagged up by copyright holders.</p>",

  "<p>Yesterday, while the US insurance giant AIG was being bailed out by the Bush administration, the global financial crisis finally hit Britain's high streets. Merger talks between Lloyds TSB and the beleaguered HBOS coincided with a sharp rise in unemployment, proof that the crisis is now damaging the UK's real economy as the spectre of joblessness is added to the enveloping financial gloom. No one knows where this is leading, but the portents are gloomy. </p> <p>The government, having learned from its poor handling of Northern Rock last year, was right to act decisively by encouraging the merger of Lloyds TSB with HBOS. This meant overruling any objections the competition authorities might have at the combined group's near-30% share of UK mortgages. There is no conclusive evidence that HBOS was in financial difficulties. But so much confidence has drained out of the system that even banks with conventional business models are vulnerable. They can be targeted by speculators selling stock they do not own to induce shares to fall fast enough to buy them back and make a fat but destabilising profit. In this way financial vultures profit from the misery of others and risk financial meltdown. If there is any truth in Vincent Cable's assertion yesterday that speculators are hunting in packs, then the Financial Services Authority should be given instant powers to stop them.</p> <p>It should be emphasised that the collapse of the markets that has undermined some of the biggest investment banks in the world is still far from the panic that ensued in the late 1920s and early 1930s, and nor is unemployment or inflation remotely near the dreadful levels of the 1980s. But no one can be sure where we are heading because the storm is unprecedented. A cyclical downturn - of the kind Gordon Brown said he would abolish - is superimposed on a rampaging global credit squeeze at a time when food prices and, until recently, energy prices are soaring. The cyclical downturn alone is already affecting the real economy. Yesterday's unemployment figures are bad enough, with a rise of 81,000 to 1.72 million in the three months to July accompanied by a sharp fall in vacancies. But those figures do not include another 71,000 who have left employment to become \"economically inactive\". At this rate we will be lucky if the much-derided forecast of David Blanchflower - a member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee - that unemployment will rise to 2 million is all that happens. Curiously, the number of people in work fell by only 16,000 in the quarter, which may suggest that the ease with which firms can shed employees is encouraging them to hang on until they are sure about prospects.</p> <p>The trouble is that the unemployment figures look backwards and take no account of the recent shake-out in construction. Nor do they reflect the job losses caused by the closure of Lehman Brothers, nor impending redundancies if the Lloyds TSB takeover of HBOS takes place. In Britain the fall in house prices has only just begun. The worst scenario is that rising unemployment will shatter consumer confidence and feed on the credit squeeze. </p> <p>It is of overwhelming importance that the meltdown in wholesale financial markets does not trigger a consumer crisis. In logic, this ought not to happen. Savings in banks and building societies are guaranteed by the government for up to \u00a335,000 per customer. Savers with more than \u00a335,000 are free to spread the risk among more than one bank. But logic does not always rule when markets are in crisis. Panic withdrawals are not only unnecessary but would bring about a crisis that need not have happened. There is no magic wand to cure this, however the government must not only improve its firefighting skills but continue to work proactively behind the scenes. If the crisis continues there is little doubt where it could be heading. A run on the banks must be avoided at all costs.</p>",

  "<p>A \u00a312bn takeover of Britain's biggest lender, HBOS, failed to halt the deepening crisis in the world's financial markets tonight as a wave of fresh speculation saw two of Wall Street's most prestigious investment banks targeted as the latest victims of the credit crunch.</p> <p>On a day of frenetic activity and unfolding drama, shares in the City fell for a third day and Wall Street stocks suffered a steep decline despite attempts to restore calm through a takeover of HBOS by Lloyds TSB, which was agreed tonight, and the nationalisation of the US insurance giant AIG. </p> <p>The FTSE 100 index dropped more than 2% to close at 4912.4 - its lowest level for more than three years. </p> <p>In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average closed down 449 points at 10,609, taking it 25% below its peak reached in October last year. The price of gold rocketed by 11% in its biggest ever one-day gain as investors searched for safe havens.</p> <p>Gordon Brown intervened to broker a solution to HBOS and Downing Street made clear it was prepared to rip up Britain's competition laws to allow the takeover - a move that may cause the loss of tens of thousands of jobs and the closure of up to 500 branches. After intense negotiations, a deal was clinched shortly after 9.30pm and is set to be announced this morning. </p> <p>In an extraordinary day of trading for HBOS, shares in the bank halved within the first hour of trading and at one stage stood at 88p. The sell-off prompted news of the proposed takeover, part of a contingency plan drawn up by the government to prevent a repeat of the Northern Rock fiasco. HBOS shares leapt above their opening level briefly before enduring another sell-off to close the day down 20%. Other banks were also caught up in the turmoil. Royal Bank of Scotland fell 10%.</p> <p>By the close of business:<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> Shares in Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs had been pummelled. The last two remaining investment banks after the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the takeover of Merrill Lynch were facing questions about their ability to withstand global turmoil. Shares in Goldman Sachs were down 19%. Morgan Stanley suffered a 24% decline, prompting a memo from its chief executive, John Mack, attacking \"irresponsible\" speculators for spreading fear and rumour.<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Dow Jones industrial average fell by almost 4%, prompting the Securities and Exchange Commission - the US financial watchdog - to announce a clampdown on short-selling of shares, a process whereby speculators borrow stock in order to sell it and then buy it back at a lower price.<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Bank of England announced that it was extending its special liquidity scheme, which is intended to ease pressures on banks, until the end of January. Until this week's turmoil in the markets, Mervyn King, the Bank's governor, had insisted the facility, introduced in the wake of the collapse of Bear Stearns in the spring, would be closed next month. The announcement came as government figures showed a 32,500 rise in the number of people out of work and claiming benefit last month, the biggest rise for 16 years.</p> <p>A terse statement to the stock exchange by HBOS at lunchtime confirmed that it was in talks with Lloyds TSB over a merger. \"In the light of market speculation, the board of HBOS confirms that it is in advanced talks with Lloyds TSB which may or may not lead to an offer being made for HBOS.\" Lloyds TSB made no comment on the proposed deal, but it is understood that its chairman, Sir Victor Blank, and chief executive, Eric Daniels, will be at the helm of the newly merged company. City sources insisted tonight that the relatively small amount cash withdrawals from HBOS - amounting to \u00a31bn of its \u00a3250bn of deposits - showed that the bank was fundamentally sound but had fallen foul of a collective loss of investor confidence in the banking industry.</p> <p>A link-up between the two high street banks would normally fall foul of Britain's tough competition laws, but the Treasury made it clear that John Hutton, the business and enterprise secretary, would use emergency powers to avoid referring the deal to the competition commission. Government sources said that the severity of the financial crisis meant that there was no alternative but to waive normal rules. HBOS, which owns the Halifax, had insisted yesterday that it was not in trouble, but is seen by the markets as particularly vulnerable to the sharp fall in UK house prices. The bank has 22 million customers, accounts for 20% of the mortgage market and takes in one pound in every six saved in the UK.</p> <p>The US authorities were tonight scrutinising the health of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley following a frenetic 10-day period in which they have nationalised the country's two biggest lenders - Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac - refused to bail out Lehman Brothers, helped orchestrate the takeover of Merrill Lynch and provided an $85bn lifeline to AIG.</p> <p>As staff arrived for work at AIG, the world's biggest insurer said it would be business as usual, albeit under government control. New York state's insurance superintendent, Eric Dinallo, who helped to broker the bailout, accused banks and insurance companies of poor management in diversifying far too broadly.</p> <p>\"It is clear to me that financial services and insurance has gotten away from its core competence and that is dangerous,\" said Dinallo, who compared companies' strategies to driving a car while putting on make-up, looking at a BlackBerry and having a conversation: \"That is not the way to drive a car safely.\"</p>",
  "<p>Condoleezza Rice recently returned empty-handed from <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-israel-rice_greenbergaug26,0,4123326.story\">yet another round of meetings in the Middle East</a>. After nearly eight years of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/27/israelandthepalestinians.usforeignpolicy\">sub-par US leadership</a>, the peace process has stalled, and the Middle East faces a host of regional issues such as a burgeoning food crisis, the destabilising threat of Iraqi refugees pouring into neighbouring countries, nuclear proliferation and the uncertain effects of globalisation.</p> <p>The US secretary of state's unproductive visit serves to underscore the inadequate nature of current US efforts - in a sense, trying to draw blood from a stone in a situation where the prospects for advances on key bilateral fronts like the Israeli-Palestinian peace process are slim. </p> <p>But there is a track of the peace process that has been dormant for the past eight years and that offers the prospect of both advancing the peace process and coordinating a regional approach to the challenges confronting the Middle East: multilateral negotiations.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Conference\">international conference in Madrid</a> in 1991 established the foundation for the Middle East peace process. The US and the Soviet Union convened the conference as the first step in a process to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict, initiate bilateral negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians and Arab states and begin multilateral negotiations on transnational issues confronting the Middle East.</p> <p>At a subsequent conference in Moscow the following year, the 36 participants organised the multilateral track into <a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Peace/multitoc.html\">five working groups</a> to focus on particular regional issues: arms control and regional security, water issues, environment, refugees and economic development. A steering committee organised the negotiations and oversaw the operations of the working groups. Syria and Lebanon boycotted, claiming that bilateral settlements were a prerequisite for multilateral negotiations.</p> <p>Despite holding meetings throughout the 1990s, the multilateral track did not produce many tangible results. There were no large agreements on a coordinated approach to water or environmental issues, and negotiations often bogged down over controversial issues such as Palestinian representation. Despite a lack of successes, however, the multilateral track was not a failure. For one, these talks helped to erase the stigma against negotiation prevalent in the region. Just 20 years ago, the notion of the Arab states engaging in negotiations with Israel would have seemed to be starry-eyed dreaming. </p> <p>Today, restarting the multilateral working groups offers a chance to reinvigorate the stagnant peace process and confront the challenges facing the Middle East. Moreover, the issues the working groups address are more relevant than ever.</p> <p>The Middle East's <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/764142.stm\">water shortages</a> continue, and exacerbate the food shortages plaguing many Arab states. In Israel and Egypt, scientists and farmers are developing new methods of countering desertification and <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/12/19/MN34TPJ51.DTL\">growing crops in desert conditions</a>. This research should be available to all countries in the region through the water and environment working groups, and coordinating projects could make the research more efficient. Arab regimes, facing growing popular discontent with rising food prices, have ample incentives to participate in the working groups.</p> <p>There is also cause to restart the arms control and regional security working group. Iran's regional ascendance and the murky goals of its nuclear programme are a shared threat (or at least area of concern) for Israel and the Arab states. Israel clearly perceives Iran as a more pressing threat than do the Arab states, but it is an opportunity to use the arms control and regional security working group to develop a coordinated strategy to confront the threat.</p> <p>The issue of refugees is a particularly sticky subject, as any negotiation quickly turns to the status of Palestinian refugees. But the potentially <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A58648-2005Feb2.html\">destabilising effects of Iraqi refugee populations</a> in Syria, Jordan, the Gulf States and elsewhere demands swift, coordinated action. Tasking the refugee working group with developing a strategy for dealing with Iraqi refugees is one way to convene the group without immediately bogging it down in the Palestinian refugee issue.</p> <p>Globalisation and the latest oil boom are transforming the region and filling the coffers of some Gulf States. But for the states without oil wealth, the economic future is dimmer. Following the dismal assessment of the <a href=\"http://hdr.undp.org/en/reports/regionalreports/arabstates/name,3140,en.html\">2002 Arab Human Development Report</a>, Middle Eastern states have refocused on education reform as the key to adapting to globalisation. Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are each experimenting with new education initiatives. The economic development working group should take up these issues, share information on education reform and discuss the best methods for economic development in the region.</p> <p>If the multilateral negotiations are re-branded as venue for confronting regional challenges, they will both advance the peace process and help to solve regional issues. Transnational threats - presently abundant the Middle East - are powerful incentives for Arab states and Israel to overcome lingering reticence for negotiations and begin cooperating in a way that will build confidence and advance the peace process.</p>",
  "<p>If you want to grasp the mixed-up, interwoven nature of the international financial markets, consider this: the US investment bank <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/15/business/15lehman.html?hp\">Lehman Brothers</a> leased a million square feet of office space in London, for which it paid about \u00a340m-\u00a350m a year. Lehmans paid its rent to a property company, the Canary Wharf Group - which in turn is controlled by another company, Songbird Estates.</p> <p>Simple enough so far? Here's where it gets complicated. The rent that Lehman Brothers paid forms part of the income behind a <a href=\"http://www.foxbusiness.com/story/markets/industries/real-estate/canary-wharf-owner-says-lehmans-london-rent-backed-aig/\">\u00a32.5bn securitisation package</a> (that is, <a href=\"http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_/ai_62300971\">corporate bonds</a> sold to outside investors, mortgaged against a stream of future earnings) through a holding company named Canary Wharf Finance II PLC. The securitisation's income was insured by the US company AIG. So when<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/15/lehmanbrothers.marketturmoil\"> Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy</a> on Monday, that meant AIG will be in the hole for the \u00a3200m that Lehmans would have paid in rent for the next four years. But AIG itself would probably have gone under yesterday or today, except that the US government effectively nationalised AIG last night in loaning it the $85bn that it needed to keep going.</p> <p>But that's not all. Remember Songbird Estates - the company that owns the company that owns the building that AIG insured the rent that Lehman Brothers defaulted on? Well, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601102&amp;sid=a6AZtcTRcqnE\">Songbird is owned</a> by a group that includes <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2008/09/17/morgan-stanley-we-have-to-be-adaptable/\">Morgan Stanley</a> - another huge US investment bank that today is getting hammered on Wall Street over its exposure to \u2026 Lehman Brothers and the property market.</p> <p>If none of that makes sense, then at least you know how Ben Bernanke - chairman of the US Federal Reserve - must feel.</p> <p>To rewind: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/sep/15/useconomy.creditcrunch\">last weekend</a> Lehman Brothers asked the US government - the Fed and the US Treasury - for the sort of bailout that was granted six months ago to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/mar/17/marketturmoil.creditcrunch1\">Bear Stearns</a>, the US investment bank that went belly-up and taken over by JP Morgan after the US authorities agreed to pick up the tab. But the Feds said no this time - and were instantly applauded for getting tough: that after bailing out Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and pumping further unprecedented billions - $70bn on Monday alone - into the financial system, the government was saying there was no more \"too big too fail\" doctrine. The <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/15/AR2008091502703.html\">Washington Post's editorial writers</a> cheered loudly: \"We think they made the right call. The long list of bailout candidates, headed at the moment by AIG, confirms that policymakers were going to have to send this message sooner than later.\" The <a href=\"http://wsj.com/article/SB122152615163440191.html\">Wall Street Journal's red-in-tooth-and-claw editorial board</a> agreed, saying \"We're happy to report that the world didn't end yesterday,\" and continuing:</p> <blockquote> <p>The Treasury and the Fed have signalled that they can say no. While Lehman's failure has spooked markets, the lesson that a storied investment house can fail without a federal rescue is its own crash course in risk management.</p> </blockquote> <p>Not so fast. Only a few hours later and the Federal Reserve rode into town to rescue AIG, an institution that it doesn't even regulate. As congressman <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2008/09/16/frank-says-financial-crisis-may-call-for-government-entity/\">Barney Frank</a> put it: \"We had a one-day experiment in free enterprise.\"</p> <p>So why resuscitate AIG and not Lehman Brothers? The thinking is that AIG fell into the category of \"<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/15/AR2008091502201.html\">too entangled to fail</a>\", meaning it was too big a part of a complex web of relationships and so its collapse would have an outsized impact on the rest of the financial world. As you can see from the example of just one London office block, mentioned above, there's something to that. But can anyone really know that for sure? Since there's no way of testing what would have happened if AIG had been allowed to go under, we can't tell.</p> <p>What we can tell is that the Fed and the US Treasury have been ham-fisted in their decision making. On Sunday AIG asked for a $40bn bridging loan from the US government to avert having its credit downgraded. The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/16/business/16aig.html\">downgrades happened, things got worse for AIG</a> - so on Monday and Tuesday the feds were badgering Wall Street banks to stump up $75bn in loans for AIG. Wall Street demurred - to no one's surprise, given the chaos in the markets and the difficulty in raising capital. So the Fed became the lender of last resort, again. But instead of the $40bn that could have done the trick on Sunday, because of its indecision its exposure is now $85bn. Not a case of \"too little too late\", but \"too much, too late\".</p> <p>The Fed and Treasury must have hoped that nationalisation of the largest US insurance company would underpin the market. But it hasn't yet. The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/18/business/18markets.html\">Dow, S&amp;P and Nasdaq share indices are all down</a> on Wednesday, and short-term money market rates are <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122156888040242963.html\">sky-rocketing</a> - meaning that banks are charging penal rates just to lend money to each other overnight (this in particular hurts retail banks).</p> <p>So where are we now? Six months after the Fed used the fact of a credit crunch to bailout Bear Stearns, the US economy is back to square one, or possible square zero. Another credit crunch is raging. The US taxpayer is now exposed to losses that refuse to be calculated: maybe $20bn for Bear Stearns, up to $85bn in loans for AIG, an estimated $100bn to $200bn for Freddie and Fannie, hundreds of billions in liquidity, much of it soaking up worthless mortgage-backed junk bonds. No one knows how much this will end up costing. (One small example: AIG is also the <a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jeWVoUjAiuhDEzNgwTvdrCx3RPFg\">shirt sponsor of Manchester United</a> - although presumably not for much longer - so one way or another, the US taxpayer is in effect loaning AIG money to pay a British football club. Manchester United should send Hank Paulson a shirt.)</p> <p>Here's a thought. Perhaps the Fed and Treasury should have let Bear Stearns go bust back in March. The immediate reaction would have been brutal. But would it have been worse than how things have turned out - six months of turmoil, $2,000bn in value wiped off global stock markets and more costly bailouts.</p> <p>And here's another thought. So far the Fed and Treasury reaction has been firefighting. The root of all of this is the bursting of the US housing market bubble and the resulting fallout. Rather than treat the symptoms, as the US government has been frantically doing this last week, it would be better off <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/16/business/economy/16stimulus.html\">treating the cause</a>: the housing market. Instead of bailing out feckless banks and their toxic derivatives, bailing out US citizens with subprime mortgages or negative equity might actually turn the <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122165409820947685.html\">housing market</a> around - and so begin to solve this mess. But as Gore Vidal once noted, the US government prefers that \"public money go not to the people but to big business. The result is a unique society in which we have free enterprise for the poor and socialism for the rich.\"</p>",
  "<p>Preoccupied with the Georgia-Russia crisis and the old fears it has resurrected, the world risks missing another important story unfolding in the Caucasus \u2013 that of Azerbaijan. The oil-rich Caspian Sea nation is going to the polls a month from now to vote for its president, but calling the process \"an election\" would be a stretch.<br> The incumbent <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3194422.stm\">Ilham Aliyev</a> \u2013 the authoritarian leader who practically inherited the presidency from his father, Heydar Aliyev, in 2003 \u2013 is expected to win the ballot in a landslide and remain in office for another five years. The opposition \u2013 fragmented, embattled, and disillusioned \u2013 announced it would boycott the vote after parliament passed restrictive amendments to Azerbaijan's election law that eliminated even the appearance of a fair process. The amendments cut the campaign period to 75 days before the vote, eliminated state television free air-time for candidates, and denied the opposition equal representation on election commissions \u2013 a key prerequisite to prevent or at least minimise the possibility of fraud. <br> Several opposition politicians later reconsidered and enlisted to run but the key prospective candidates did not. As a result, on October 15, Aliyev will face six virtual unknowns and win without a doubt. Azerbaijanis' \"choice\" will only be a nominal one. In his five years in office, Aliyev Jr has consolidated his position as a supreme executive \u2013 maintaining authority over the cabinet, legislature, the military, and the judiciary. Externally, his centralised regime has been bolstered by the global demand for oil and the west's need for a partner in anti-terrorism. Azerbaijan has strategic importance for both the United States and Europe \u2013 oil in the Caspian Sea provides an alternative to Russian and Persian Gulf supplies, and the west needs a stable partner along Iran's border. These interests have muted international reaction to Azerbaijani authorities' human rights abuses at home. Domestically, critics have been silenced through imprisonment, violence, and intimidation. In a <a href=\"http://www.cpj.org/elmar/\">new report</a> titled \"Finding Elmar's Killers\", the Committee to Protect Journalists finds that Aliyev's success is built to a large extent on his administration's crackdown on the independent media. Television \u2013 the most influential news medium in the country \u2013 is under the administration's control either directly or through pro-Aliyev owners. Low-circulation print media have more editorial freedom, but their impact on public opinion is small. And with the authorities clamping down on critical journalists, fewer reporters are willing to cover sensitive topics, the most dangerous of which is reporting on the president and his family. Disgruntled officials use criminal defamation charges agaisnt journalists frequently, demanding imprisonment and high damages. Compliant courts usually rubberstamp those demands. The government has resisted persistent calls by international organisations, including the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, to decriminalise libel. <br> When Azerbaijan jailed 10 reporters for their work in 2007, it became Europe and Central Asia's leading jailer of journalists, according to CPJ research. Several were later released through a pardon but the most critical ones remained in jail. Those include <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eynulla_Fatullayev\">Eynulla Fatullayev</a>, editor of the now closed independent weekly Realny Azerbaijan, and the brothers Sakit and Genimet Zakhidov with the pro-opposition Azadlyg newspaper. The journalists are serving jail terms on trumped-up charges such as hooliganism, drug possession, and terrorism. CPJ has found those charges to be fabricated and politically motivated.<br> The imprisonment of Eynulla Fatullayev is emblematic of the lengths to which Azerbaijani authorities have gone to stifle independent reporting on sensitive topics. Following his own dogged investigation into the contract-style murder in 2005 of his former boss and mentor, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4315439.stm\">Elmar Huseynov</a>, Fatullayev was slammed with a series of spurious charges \u2013 the heaviest of all being terrorism \u2013 and imprisoned for eight-and-a-half years. Fatullayev had angered the authorities by questioning their will to solve the murder, and reportedly finding and interviewing one of Huseynov's alleged killers.<br> With Fatullayev behind bars, there is no current scrutiny of the official investigation into Huseynov's assassination. The crime remains unsolved and Huseynov's killers are still at large. Following Huseynov's murder, the authorities in Azerbaijan have also failed to investigate severe attacks on at least eight journalists. CPJ interviewed the victims during a week-long trip to Baku in May, recording their disturbing accounts of government indifference, neglect, and, in at least one case, perceived complicity in the attacks.  Huseynov's family members spoke to CPJ of their own disappointment with the official conduct, calling the investigation confusing and secretive at best. Indeed, Azerbaijani authorities have been opaque about their progress towards finding Huseynov's killers. Lately, they have publicly ascribed primary responsibility for arresting the two alleged suspects \u2013 ethnic Azeri Georgian citizens Tair Hubavov and Teymuraz Aliyev \u2013 to Interpol. But the public record does not support that claim, CPJ research found. An official with Aliyev's administration assured CPJ that Azerbaijan remains \"fully committed\" to solving Huseynov's murder. But the public record does not support that assertion either.  The international community is busy \u2013 and rightly so \u2013 moderating the Georgia-Russia crisis and the east-west diplomatic rift it has caused. But we should not forget about Azerbaijan and we should call its government to account on its human rights record. Azer Akhmedov, the acting editor of Azadlyg newspaper told CPJ: \"You know, in a perfect world, it is logical for people to be happy when they have an energy resource. But in Azerbaijan, we say the opposite \u2013 we would be better off if we didn't have oil.\" </p> <p>Akhmedov, whose editor, Genimet Zakhidov, is in jail for \"hooliganism\", told CPJ Azerbaijan is \"cursed\" with by its oil resources and geographic position close to Iran. \"We're stuck between the devil and the deep blue sea,\" he told CPJ. \"We are faced with the reality that human rights are low down on the West's agenda.\" The international community should work to prove Akhmedov wrong \u2013 by demanding the release of all imprisoned journalists, the decriminalisation of libel, the timely and thorough investigation of violence against reporters, and calling on the Azerbaijani government to allow the press to do its job without fear of reprisal. </p> <p><em>Nina Ognianova is Europe and Central Asia Programme Coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists.</em></p>",

The value of names can range from just a few pounds to several million depending on its perceived value.</p> <p>So far, the world's most valuable domain name is sex.com, which was fraudulently transferred from entrepreneur Gary Kremen's name in the 1990s, but eventually returned after a court battle a decade later. </p> <p>The reports are disputed, but it is believed Kremen earned between $11m and $14m when he sold up in 2006. Business.com shot into the Guinness Book of Records in 1999 as the world's most expensive domain name after its sale for $7.5m at the height of the dotcom boom in 1999. Several years later, Diamonds.com which as the name suggests is an American jewellery retailer, went for the same amount.</p> <p>The UK's most expensive domain name, in contrast, is cruises.co.uk which was bought by cruise.co.uk from German travel company Nees Reisen for \u00a3560,000 earlier this year.</p> <p>Companies that want a particular domain name have three options when faced with cyber-speculators: they can follow the legal route and challenge the owner through the courts or go through the international dispute resolution process offered by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). Or they can just pay the squatter to hand over the domain.</p> <p>In the past, most cyber real estate speculators have hoped to get paid off. But now cyber-squatters are putting adverts on the sites they have grabbed in the hope of making money from traffic that ends up on the site in the meantime.<br></p>",
  "<p>Short sellers in New York and London are facing tough new regulations as market officials attempt to curb what they see as \"abusive\" attacks on the proper functioning of stock markets \u2014 particularly the pricing of banking and financial stocks.</p> <p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission will tomorrow impose new rules designed to end \"price manipulating\" through aggressive short selling. Earlier this week the chancellor, Alistair Darling, signalled the Financial Services Authority was also looking at closer policing of certain short-selling activities.</p> <p>Hedge funds betting on a drop in the Lehman Brothers share price are estimated to have made a windfall of more than $3bn when the investment bank filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday, rendering shares as good as worthless. Even bigger gains were made by short sellers when rival Bear Sterns failed in March.</p> <p>One of the most successful speculators to profit from the demise of Lehman was New York-based hedge fund Greenlight Capital, run by 37-year-old founder David Einhorn. </p> <p>In recent months Einhorn, a bridge and poker enthusiast known for his love of afternoon napping, has become a posterboy for short sellers. He has shown himself unafraid to publicly criticise firms he has targeted \u2014 particularly Lehman. </p> <p>The Greenlight boss has joked that he expects a subpoena from regulators for his efforts, but insists he is truth-seeker not a panic-sower. He has a reputation for leaving a maelstrom of fear and anger in his wake.</p> <p>Meanwhile, regulators have grown increasingly concerned at the market-moving power of hedge funds that circulate critical research or publicly attack companies in which they hold short positions. Concern is deepest when funds target banks that operate in markets where the ability to trade is highly sensitive to investor confidence.</p> <p>Short sellers like Greenlight borrow shares and sell them in the market in the hope the shares can eventually be bought back at a lower price before being returned to the lender. The difference between the sale and purchase price becomes the shorter's profit.</p> <p>But in fast-moving markets experienced hedge funds and others have been able to take up short positions without having first borrowed shares. Put another way, they have been contracting to sell shares that they have not yet borrowed.</p> <p>It is this practice, known as \"naked shorting\", that the SEC now has in its sights. From tomorrow, the regulator is tightening rules on short selling \u2014 though it stops short of outlawing naked shorts.</p> <p>\"These several actions today make it crystal clear that the SEC has zero tolerance for abusive naked short selling,\" said SEC chairman Christopher Cox.</p> <p>The regulator said naked shorting \"can allow manipulators to force prices down far lower than would be possible in legitimate short-selling conditions.\"</p> <p>Earlier this week Alistair Darling sought to draw a similar distinction between \"legitimate hedging\", such as practiced by airlines protecting themselves from oil price rises, and \"speculation that can be quite harmful\".</p> <p>\"The Financial Services Authority has been looking at that problem with a view to taking action to try and stop that because it can be extremely damaging.\" he told BBC Radio 4.</p> <p>But there are some doubt about the likely effectiveness of regulatory reforms. In 2005 a previous attempt by the SEC to clamp down on naked shorting was quickly found to contain easily exploited loopholes which allowed existing practices to continue almost unchecked.</p> <p>In July this year the US regulator imposed further restrictions on short selling methods in relation to 19 financial stocks including Lehman, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as well as European banks Barclays, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland and HSBC. </p> <p>But the move appeared to do little to curb the increasingly large short bets being placed by hedge funds on vulnerable financial stocks.</p> <p>It is difficult to monitor exactly how much a stock is being shorted, but the amount of shares that have been loaned out by investors is the best available proxy. Figures from research house Dataexplorers.com show about 10% of Leman's shares had been loaned out since early March. </p> <p>There was another wave of short selling interest in Lehman last week with a further 8% of shares being loaned out. By Friday 17.8% of now worthless Lehman shares \u2014 owned by institutional investors and pension funds \u2014 had been loaned out. The vast majority will have been short-sold months ago by hedge funds taking huge bets on the investment bank's woes spiralling.</p> <p>Einhorn, who two years ago briefly enjoyed some celebrity on the Las Vegas poker circuit after winning $660,000 at the World Series of Poker tournament, has remained unrepentant. He believes himself to be providing Wall Street and the global financial markets with a well overdue reality check. </p> <p>\"Investment banks claim they are in the 'moving' business rather than the 'storage' business, but the very nature of some of their holdings suggests that this is not true. And they hold this stuff on tremendously levered balance sheets,\" he explained at a hedge fund conference in April.</p> <p>\"How did this happen? The answer is that the investment banks outmanoeuvred the watchdogs ... As a result, with no one watching, the managements of the investment banks did exactly what they were incentivised to do: maximise employee compensation. Investment banks pay out 50% of revenues as compensation. More leverage, means more revenues, which means more compensation.\"</p> <p>Aware of the acrimony he has attracted, Einhorn joked: \"Based on the current regulatory environment, the pessimistic side of me says that regulators will probably decide to send me a subpoena and send Lehman a Coke.\"</p> <p>The sniping was too much for Lehman chief executive Richard Fuld, who has called for the SEC to ban short selling. In April he told investors at an annual shareholder meeting: \"I will hurt the shorts, and that is my goal.\"</p> <p>A month later Lehman continued its counterattack, issuing a statement claiming Einhorn \"cherry-picks certain specific items from our [financial filings] and takes them out of context and distorts them to relay a false impression of the firm's financial condition, which suits him because of his short position in our stock.\"</p> <p>Einhorn appears to have had the last word, though he did tell reporters in June he was not wishing for the collapse of Lehman. \"We would not win if Lehman went down and took the whole financial system with it. An actual collapse of Lehman - that would not be a good thing.\"</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/merrilllynch\">Merrill Lynch</a>'s newly recruited chief executive, John Thain, stands to share a $200m (\u00a3111.4m) payout with two senior lieutenants for less than a year's work which culminated this week in the bank surrendering its 94-year-old independence.</p> <p>The Wall Street bank known as the \"thundering herd\" agreed to a $50bn takeover by Bank of America on Monday after a hasty 48 hours of negotiation. The talks were prompted by fears over banking stability arising from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/lehmanbrothers\">the collapse of Lehman Brothers</a>.</p> <p>Thain, who was previously the head of the New York Stock Exchange, joined Merrill in December with a mandate to steer the bank out of financial trouble. When he arrived, he was given a $15m signing on bonus. If he leaves in Bank of America's takeover, he stands to get a further $11m in accelerated stock payouts.</p> <p>Two former <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/goldmansachs\">Goldman Sachs</a> executives hired by Thain are likely to do even better. Merrill's head of global trading, Thomas Montag, who joined in August, has already received a $39m bonus. Together with stock options accelerated by a buyout, he could end the year with $76m. The bank's head of strategy, Peter Kraus, was given a $95m package including bonuses and stock awards to replace his generous compensation at Goldman when he joined in May, according to figures obtained by Bloomberg News.</p> <p>It is yet to be determined whether any of the trio will have a role at Bank of America. Even by the standards of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/executivesalaries\">Wall Street payouts</a>, the sums are unusually high for such a short period of employment. </p> <p>Steven Hall, a New York-based executive remuneration expert, told the Guardian that Merrill had little choice but to honour the contracts: \"At the time they were recruiting [Thain], a negotiation took place and he would have told them this is what his price was. You can't go back and change things now \u2014 it's almost a kind of buyer's remorse we may be seeing.\"</p> <p>Thain, 53, is a leading fundraiser for the Republican presidential candidate John McCain. A doctor's son, he is an amateur beekeeper who used to keep hives in his back garden. He bought a two-bedroom apartment on New York's Park Avenue two years ago which had an asking price of $27.5m. He was hired by Merrill to steady the ship after huge losses on the credit markets which were run up under the leadership of ousted chief executive Stan O'Neal. </p> <p>At a press conference this week to announce the buyout by Bank of America, Thain admitted that selling Merrill was not the original plan: \"This isn't necessarily the outcome I would have expected when I took the job.\"</p> <p>He insisted that he had made progress in tidying up Merrill: \"We've been consistently cleaning up the balance sheet, repairing the damage that had been done over the last two or three years.\"</p> <p>Thain reportedly fought back tears at a meeting to brief staff on Merrill's buyout this week. Analysts say that Merrill's liabilities were greater than he could have anticipated when he joined \u2014 and some have praised his decision to sell.</p> <p>Defenders of Wall Street's controversial pay packages generally argue that although bankers do well during good times, they hold insecure jobs which are vulnerable during downturns.</p> <p>\"What we do see is that when times get tough, people lose their jobs \u2014 and that's the ultimate in pay cuts,\" said Hall.</p> <p>A Merrill Lynch spokesman said the bank would not comment on executive compensation beyond the statutory disclosures required in filings with regulators.</p>",
  "<p>Sarah Palin may have seen the light - sort of - on climate change but that did not spare her from being singled out today as America's environmental enemy of the year.</p> <p>The Centre for Biological Diversity awarded Palin its Rubber Dodo award for her insistence - despite scientific evidence to the contrary - that the polar bear population was rising across the Arctic.</p> <p>The Arizona thinktank condemned the Alaska governor as a \"global warming denier\".</p> <p>\"Governor Palin has waged a deceptive, dangerous, and costly battle against the polar bear,\" Kieran Suckling, the centre's director, said in a statement. \"Her position on global warming is so extreme, she makes Dick Cheney look like an Al Gore devotee.\"</p> <p>The slap for Palin comes less than a week after she belatedly and grudgingly admitted the possibility of a human factor in climate change in her first television interview since she was chosen as John McCain's running mate.</p> <p>The conversion on climate change was swiftly followed by further revelations of Palin's tenuous relationship to scientific fact. Palin, it appears, is so fond of fake tans that she had a tanning bed installed in the governor's mansion early last year.</p> <p>News reports today said that Palin purchased the used tanning bed from a local health club and moved it into the official residence soon after her election.</p> <p>A few months later, in May 2007, Palin issued a proclamation as governor on skin cancer awareness month urging Alaskans to take preventative measures against the disease.</p> <p>\"Skin cancer is caused, overwhelmingly, by over-exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun and from tanning beds,\" she said in a press release. \"It is largely preventable.\"</p> <p>McCain had tumours causing skin cancer removed in 1993 and 2000, and is religious about using sunscreen and wearing a hat when outdoors.</p>",
  "<p>The west's efforts to use the United Nations to promote its values and shape the global agenda are failing, according to a detailed study published today.</p> <p>A sea change in the balance of power in favour of China, India, Russia and other emerging states is wrecking European and US efforts to entrench human rights, liberties and multilateralism. Western policies in crisis regions as diverse as Georgia, Zimbabwe, Burma or the Balkans are suffering serial defeats in what the study identifies as a protracted trend.</p> <p>The haemorrhaging of western power, as reflected in longer-term voting patterns in key UN bodies, is mirrored by the increasing clout of China, Russia and the Islamic world, according to an audit of European influence at the UN by the European Council on Foreign Relations.</p> <p>\"The EU is suffering a slow-motion crisis at the UN,\" says the report, noting that the west is now being regularly outwitted in global diplomatic poker by the Chinese and Russians. \"The problem is fading power to set the rules. The UN is increasingly being shaped by China, Russia and their allies \u2026 The west is in disarray. The EU's rifts with the US on many human rights issues at the UN in the Bush era have weakened both.\"</p> <p>US and European failure to win the day at the UN security council in recent votes on Zimbabwe and Burma as well as defeats last year on Kosovo or Darfur and the constant struggle to muster support for global action against Iran because of its nuclear ambitions are traced as part of a broader decline over the past decade.</p> <p>Using a programme designed to analyse voting patterns and statistics, the thinktank found that European policies on human rights enjoyed the support of 72% of UN members a decade ago but only 48% by last year, while the US suffered a steeper collapse from 77% to 30%.</p> <p>\"The pattern of votes in the general assembly shows that opposition to the EU is growing, spurred by a common resistance to European efforts at promoting human rights,\" said the study.</p> <p>The beneficiaries of this disaffection with the west have been China and Russia, which defend national sovereignty and non-intervention in sovereign countries no matter how grievous the atrocities and human rights violations blamed on national governments. Over the past decade support for Chinese and Russian stances on human rights issues has soared from less than 50% to 74% in the UN general assembly.</p> <p>The assembly kicked off this week in New York with the west bracing itself for another debacle. Serbia is to use the session to demand a vote on the \"illegality\" of the secession last February of Kosovo, whose breakaway was strongly backed by the US and most of the EU, and to refer the dispute to the UN's international court of justice. Despite strenuous lobbying by the Europeans to prevent the vote, they have conceded defeat. Only 46 of the 192 UN states have recognised Kosovo's independence. And western attempts to rally support for Georgia in the Caucasus crisis will be rebuffed by the Russians.</p> <p>\"The EU has collectively failed to adapt to new power trends,\" said Martti Ahtisaari, the former Finnish president and a chairman of the thinktank.<br>The setbacks for the west at the UN in New York are compounded by a worse record in winning the battles for rights and freedoms at the Geneva-based UN Human Rights Council. In March the Islamic bloc changed the mandate for the council's rapporteur on freedom of expression, charging him, in the wake of the Danish cartoons crisis, with the obligation to record blasphemy. Critics said the post was supposed to function as an agent of liberty, but became an instrument of repression. </p> <p>\"The head of steam building up in the Islamic world for worldwide defamation legislation is huge,\" said Keith Porteous-Wood, director of Britain's National Secular Society. \"The Human Rights Council can no longer serve a useful purpose.\"</p> <p>In the council's two-year existence, the 19 European countries on the 47-strong body have been marginalised, mired in despair and a sense of futility after losing more than half the votes conducted.</p> <p>The poor European record on winning the world's hearts and minds contrasts with Brussels' habit of talking up the merits of its \"soft power\" attractiveness and indicates that the EU's huge financial investment in being the world's biggest aid donor and the UN's biggest funder is not translating into political gains.</p>",
  "<p>Rice paddies in the north-western Haitian village of Liancourt lie submerged in pools of water, some of them the size of lakes. </p> <p>In the south, entire groves of plantain trees have toppled. And in the central plateau, wilted beanfields and cornfields limp in ruin - remnants of Haiti's battering by four consecutive storms.</p> <p>In Cuba, trucks loaded with stacks of plantains rumble down storm-wrecked roads. Farmers are in a hurry to salvage what they can in a country that just lost 80,000 acres (32,400 hectares) of bananas and 4,355 tonnes of food that was stored in warehouses when two hurricanes in as many weeks hit there.</p> <p>\"That's the one thing we will have for days and days and days,\" said Rosa Arrencibia, 47, of Camaguey. \"Plantains.\"</p> <p>A busy hurricane season has hit Cuba and Haiti where it hurts most: in the heart of agriculture. </p> <p>This hurricane season hasn't just brought death, but also destruction to those two countries as well as to the Dominican Republic and Jamaica, washing away months of food staples at a time when nations face rising global food and fuel prices.</p> <p>For Haiti, the toughest loss was in the Artibonite valley, the heart of the country's already paltry breadbasket. Cuba suffered agricultural losses on both coasts, where storms wiped out not just the bananas that farmers scrambled to recover, but the entire sugar cane crop, 135,000 tonnes of citrus and a staggering 700,000 tonnes of food.</p> <p>\"That's devastating,\" said Bill Messina, an agricultural economist at the University of Florida, who monitors Cuba's farming industry. \"For agriculture, this is a tremendous blow.\"</p> <p>Cuba was already struggling to increase food production and had recently begun a quest to give unused state land to farmers. But with huge losses to coffee, tobacco, sugar and most other crops, experts say it will take more than extra incentives for farmers to recover.</p> <p>\"The big unanswered question in this story is the food supply,\" said Cuba expert Phil Peters, vice-president of the Lexington Institute think tank in Arlington, Virginia. \"They lost food in the warehouses, crops in the fields, and the crops that earn the foreign exchange they use to earn revenue to import food. That's three problems that add up.\"</p> <p>Feeling an equal blow is Haiti, where widespread hunger triggered deadly riots earlier this year, and where the storms ruined more than 50,000 acres of crops and dashed any hope of reviving this nation's agriculture to replace expensive, imported rice and other food products.</p> <p>Government officials estimate the loss at $180m (\u00a3100.6m) - and counting.</p> <p>\"This couldn't have happened at a worse time for us,\" said Joanas Gue, the country's new agriculture minister.</p> <p>\"The four storms that arrived came during a period of harvest. We've lost all of the beans in the mountains. We've lost all of the plantain fields, especially in Belle-Anse and Marigot in the south-east, the plantain bed. We've lost a good portion of the corn harvest.\"</p> <p>There is little promise of a quick recovery for Haiti, where farmers say all they can do is pray for no more rain.</p> <p>\"Things are not good, but what can we do?\" said Selonger Pierre, 50 and a father of five, who was feverishly ploughing and plucking away in his flooded rice paddy just hours before Hurricane Ike flooded the valley once more. Wading in thigh-high muck, he reflected on his situation: The rains didn't just flood his fields - they washed away livestock.</p> <p>\"We are nearing starvation,\" he said.</p> <p>Just before the storms, Haiti had poured more than $30m in to this season's rice crop and invested $13m in more than 26,600,000 pounds (11793 grams) of fertilizer, selling it at 80% below market value to already-struggling farmers.</p> <p>Haitian farmers and consumers were close to reaping the rewards - 120,000 metric tonnes of rice, 30,000 more than last year - of those investments when the storms came barrelling through, sending mud and rocks rolling from the hillside, rivers overflowing their banks and irrigation canals into disarray.</p> <p>\"We will have a huge food deficit,\" said Gue.</p> <p>Mostly used for domestic consumption, the crop is a lifeline for most Haitians, who often can't afford much else.</p> <p>\"We lost all of our trees,\" said Jean-Mario Pierre, 24, looking at his backyard in Vialet, a rural community in southern Petit-Goave, where not one plantain grove survived Hanna's destruction.</p> <p>Pierre said the grove, which has been in the family since 1982, feeds and clothes 17 family members, all of whom live in the yard. When the family grows tired of eating plantain, they barter.</p> <p>\"Sometimes you sell the plantain, and you can't even buy three cups of rice because the rice is so expensive,\" he said. \"We have no other choice but to suffer.\"</p> <p>Less than a quarter-mile down the road, Clermont Beaubrun, 60, waded through his grove of toppled trees with a machete, looking for the last of his plantains. \"The grove is destroyed,\" he said, his voice laden with frustration. \"We are now at the mercy of God, and the government.\"</p> <p>Even before the storms, Haiti's government was struggling to feed the country's nearly 9 million people. The riots toppled the prime minister and sparked a worldwide appeal by the United Nations and others for aid. The US shipped $45m worth of food, which was supposed to last until the end of the year, but is running out because of the storm crisis.</p> <p>\"We have a good recipe for a disaster that's worse than a humanitarian crisis,\" said Joel Boutroue, the United Nations Development Programme resident representative in Haiti.</p> <p>Boutroue, like others in the international community, is concerned about how long Haitians, resilient in the face of misery, will battle hunger this time around before a repeat of April's deadly riots.</p> <p>\"The security situation is even more fragile than what it was,\" says UN special envoy Hedi Annabi. \"Prices will go up, the scarcity of food, all of that could make the security situation more fragile.\"</p> <p>That impending reality worries Haiti's international donors.</p> <p>\"It used to be a question of affordability,\" US ambassador Janet Sanderson said about Haiti's food crisis. \"Now it's a question of availability as well. That's a double whammy.\"</p>",

  "<p>Haiti has been <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7597307.stm\">battered by three storms</a> in the last three weeks, killing more than 200 people, displacing many more and stretching government services to breaking point. This is part of a wider trend. The cost of natural disasters is on the rise - averaging on conservative estimates over $80bn annually in this decade - and while more than 60% of the damages are registered in high-income countries, the burden in terms of human lives and disrupted livelihoods is greatest in poorer countries. Loss of life is 20-times greater in poor than rich countries, and the final bill can add up to a multiple of annual income, with the downside risks skewed toward lower middle-income countries and small island economies.</p> <p>Wealthy countries with diversified economies are better prepared to deal with climatic shocks and can recover quickly when they hit. Though even here, as the Katrina experience reminds us, the challenge can be formidable. Poorer countries and communities, by contrast, face these events with a series of big economic handicaps including weakly diversified economies, low levels of savings, high levels of indebtedness, poor infrastructure and weak public finances. As the UN's 2008 <a href=\"http://www.un.org/esa/policy/wess/wess2008files/wess08/wess2008.pdf\">World Economic and Social Survey</a> (pdf) points out, and the Haiti experience confirms, the resulting threat is not only from potentially catastrophic large-scale disasters, but also repeated smaller-scale disasters that occur seasonally or annually. </p> <p>Under these conditions, disasters often create a vicious circle of persistent vulnerability to climatic shocks by increasing poverty levels, eroding social networks and threatening food security. All of the 32 <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/\">food-insecure countries</a> identified by the UN face multiple natural hazards, and in many cases weak state structures are further threatened by civil strife and conflict. </p> <p>A multilateral and integrated policy response is urgently needed which better links emergency relief to development. The challenge is all the more pressing in light of the link between the <a href=\"http://archives.cnn.com/2000/NATURE/09/29/warming.disasters.reut/\">growing frequency of natural disasters and climate change</a>. The world's insurance industry is already anticipating future disaster costs that could exceed a trillion dollars annually. The devastation will again be greatest for the world's poorest communities. </p> <p>The highest priority in managing disasters must be to reduce, through increased investment in preparation and adaptation measures, the risks of shocks turning in to disasters. This can be achieved through appropriate land use planning, improved infrastructure design, monitoring and warning systems and integrated water management systems.</p> <p>Financing is the big constraint. The international community is often quick to respond to the distress of large-scale disasters through emergency relief. However, relief aid is heavily influenced by economic and geopolitical interests and by biases in news coverage. It has been estimated that these biases may have reduced flows to Asia by over one third. Moreover the efforts of the UN are often compromised by requested funding falling short of the required levels, to the tune of billions of dollars each year.</p> <p>When it comes to longer-term measures, the response is if anything even more fragmented. Various ad hoc compensatory arrangements exist, and market-friendly responses such as insurance contracts and catastrophe bonds have been attracting the attention of the donor community. But these are on too small a scale, are expensive and deal only with the consequences of disasters. Only 2% of disaster management funds are currently spent by bilateral and multilateral donors on proactive disaster risk reduction.</p> <p>What is urgently needed is a properly funded global mechanism to mobilise resources for an integrated risk-management approach to natural disasters: a multi-billion-dollar fund would provide automatic, predictable funding to affected regions and communities, could act as an umbrella mechanism for scaling up existing schemes to effectively reduce vulnerability to natural hazards and could act as a clearing house for effective policy advice and technical cooperation.</p> <p>The scale of such a fund will need some careful costing, but it would go well beyond the figure of $4-5bn suggested by Gordon Brown in 2006 for a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/jan/11/debtrelief.internationalaidanddevelopment\">disaster relief and reconstruction fund</a>. Doubling that figure annually would seem a conservative estimate. But the bottom line is that the returns from such investments are potentially very significant. According to the US Geological Survey the <a href=\"http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/NEWS/0,,contentMDK:20169861~pagePK:64257043~piPK:437376~theSitePK:4607,00.html\">economic losses worldwide from disasters</a> in the 1990s could have been reduced by $280bn through investing $40bn in disaster risk reduction.</p> <p>The international community has been moving toward a more integrated approach to dealing with natural disasters, but the process has been slow. With most experts predicting even more hazardous events due to climate change, the most vulnerable countries and communities in the Caribbean and elsewhere are living on borrowed time.</p>",

  "<p>Picture the scene. A whizz-kid chemist from the food laboratory department provides a report to the chief executive of a leading supermarket. The boffins, he says, have developed a wonderful new pork pie, which is marvellously tasty and could make the company a mint.</p> <p>The chief executive, who came from the finance department and knows far more about balance sheets than he does about pork pies, asks what the catch is. The only catch, the guy in the white coat replies, is that each pork pie contains a small amount of a toxic ingredient \u2013 but it is so tiny that there is no real risk. What's more, it is the toxic element that gives the pie its unique and irresistible flavour.</p> <p>Given the all-clear by the board, the company starts selling pies by the shed load because, at first, they are hugely popular. All the other supermarket companies follow suit, and soon there is a full-blown craze for them. Warnings that there could be side-effects are ignored, and even when there are unconfirmed reports that people are starting to get sick, the supermarkets keep flogging them. </p> <p>Eventually, customers die and the roof falls in.</p> <p>This, of course, is an allegorical tale. The supermarket are the world's big banks. The pork pies are the unfathomable financial instruments that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2005/feb/15/8\">have poisoned</a> the global markets. The boffins are the financial \"rocket scientists\" who constructed their complex \u2013 and useless \u2013 mathematical models to show that risk was infinitessimally small.</p> <p>Now, imagine for a second what would have happened to the boss of our mythical supermarket. He would have been banged up within the day; his company would have gone bust by the end of the week. No supermarket would dare to take such risks with the health of its customer; nor would a pharmaceutical company; nor would a car company. </p> <p>Yet, it is clear that the lust for easy profits was so strong that banks continued to market their toxic derivatives long after it was clear that they could have all sorts of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketturmoil\">nasty side-effects</a>.</p> <p>Why the difference? Simple. The big banks have been given freedoms not enjoyed by their counterparts in the rest of the corporate sector. That freedom has been abused, and we are now seeing the baleful results. </p> <p>Remember that when you next hear a representative of the City or Wall Street calling for no hasty return to \"oppressive regulation\" in response to the crisis. Some oppressive regulation is precisely what is needed.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Number 10 stands firm on Commonwealth scholarship cut</strong></p> <p>Downing Street is standing firm on a decision to axe Foreign Office funding for the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan, which enables students from the developed Commonwealth to study for doctorates in the UK.</p> <p>It has responded to an online petition protesting at the decision by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to end its contribution.</p> <p>Almost 2,000 people signed the petition in protest at the decision announced by David Miliband, the Foreign Secretry, to end FCO support. It means that Commonwealth scholarships for Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Singapore, Malta, Cyprus, Brunei and the Bahamas will end, and that reciprocal arrangements will be at risk.</p> <p>Downing Street's response says that the decision does not in any way reflect a negative view of the CSFP.</p> <p>\"On the contrary, the government regards the CSFP as a good and well-run programme. The fact that overall British government funding to the plan is increasing over the next three years \u2013 from \u00a316.98m in 2007-08 to \u00a317.98m in 2008-09, about \u00a318m in 2009-10 and over \u00a317.5m in 2010-11 - is evidence of our regard for its work.</p> <p>\"But the FCO is tightening the focus of its scholarship programmes around building relationships with leaders of the future. The FCO assess that their own scheme, the Chevening programme, is therefore a better vehicle for FCO funding. The Chevening programme is more tightly focused on future leaders and connects scholars and alumni much more directly to our network of diplomatic missions.</p> <p>\"It is better value for money, student for student. And through Chevening the FCO can direct resources globally in a way that more accurately reflects the UK's international priorities. Chevening remains a global scheme and through it the FCO will continue to provide scholarships to future leaders from developed Commonwealth countries.\"</p> <p><strong>Dwindling Atlantic salmon tracked off Canadian coast</strong></p> <p>Scientists working with Canada's Ocean Tracking Network, based at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, are tracking Atlantic salmon in the open ocean. </p> <p>This summer 100 salmon tagged with tiny acoustic transmitters crossed a 13 mile line of acoustic receivers deployed by the OTN in the waters off of Halifax.</p> <p>The fish, which originated in the Penobscot River in Maine, sent signals to the receivers, and information about their passage was then downloaded from the receivers to a research vessel.</p> <p>The information has shown that while some salmon may die before reaching Halifax, many still survive. </p> <p>Mike Stokesbury, director of research for OTN, said: \"In Maine, traditional methods of restoring Atlantic salmon by stocking fish have not been very successful, with only 0.68% returning.</p> <p>\"With the tagged salmon we can track more fish further into the ocean than ever before and get meaningful results.\"</p> <p><strong>Words for numbers not needed for maths \u2013 study</strong></p> <p>A study by University College London and the University of Melbourne of Aboriginal children from two communities that lack words or gestures for numbers has found that they are nevertheless able to copy and perform number-related tasks.</p> <p>Findings, published in the journal PNAS, suggest that humans possess an innate mechanism for counting, which may develop differently in children with difficulty in understanding and learning maths.</p> <p>Professor Brian Butterworth, lead author from the UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, says: \"Recently, an extreme form of linguistic determinism has been revived which claims that counting words are needed for children to develop concepts of numbers above three. That is, to possess the concept of 'five' you need a word for five. Evidence from children in numerate societies, but also from Amazonian adults whose language does not contain counting words, has been used to support this claim. </p> <p>\"However, our study of Aboriginal children suggests that we have an innate system for recognising and representing the number of objects in a set and that the lack of a number vocabulary should not prevent us from doing numerical tasks that do not require number words.\"</p> <p>The study worked with children aged four to seven from two indigenous communities: one on the edge of the Tanami Desert about 400 km north west of Alice Springs where Warlpiri is spoken; the other on Groote Eylandt in the Gulf of Carpentaria, where the local language is Anindilyakwa. </p> <p>Both have words for one, two, few and many. In Anindilyakwa there are ritual words for numbers to 20, but children will not know these. The team also worked with an English-speaking indigenous group in Melbourne.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/list/atoz#keyword13\">Lehman Brothers</a> staff in the UK were thrown a lifeline today when Barclays said it might include some of the investment bank's London operations in a deal to buy its north American business.</p> <p>John Varley, Barclays chief executive, said the bank had \"opportunities but no obligation\" to buy parts of Lehman outside the US.</p> <p>\"We have acquired assets in the US and we are now looking quickly and seriously to see what might fit with the businesses we have around the world,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Are we required to acquire other assets in this transaction? No. Are there people whose activities are complementary to the businesses we are buying? It is possible to contemplate that and [we are] looking at that.\"</p> <p>Barclays agreed a $1.75bn (\u00a3980m) deal to buy the core business of Lehman Brothers, the investment bank that filed for bankruptcy on Monday amid one of Wall Street's worst crises.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/17/barclay.lehmanbrothers1\">bank issued a statement at around 2am today</a> in the UK confirming it would buy Lehman's North American investment banking and capital markets business. That saves around 10,000 jobs on Wall Street. Barclays said yesterday the deal secures about half the revenue stream of the old Lehman Brothers.</p> <p>Bob Diamond, the Barclays president who led the negotiations, said the deal was a \"once in a lifetime opportunity for Barclays\". He said the focus of interest in the UK would be the equity and capital markets business. \"We wouldn't want to miss the opportunity to add some talent from the UK and Europe.\"</p> <p>Varley said Barclays had been considering a deal with Lehman for some months, as it became apparent the bank was heading for trouble.</p> <p>The agreement makes Barclays one of the leading banks on Wall Street, with capabilities across equity and debt markets, mergers and acquisitions, commodities trading and foreign exchange. The businesses will be merged into Barclays Capital, though it is not clear whether the Lehman name, one of the oldest on Wall Street, will disappear in the short term.</p> <p>The deal still needs to be approved by the bankruptcy court.</p> <p>Barclays is paying $250m cash and taking on $72bn in trading assets and $68bn in trading liabilities. They include mortgage assets, equities, corporate debt, government bonds and commercial paper.</p> <p>The bank gave further detail on the assets yesterday. It said less than 5% were mortgages, that these had been marked down and were further so during due diligence. Barclays said the assets and liabilities being acquired had been through \"quite a cleansing process\", adding it had been given the chance to pick and choose assets and had been doing due diligence since the weekend.</p> <p>Barclays said the deal would enhance its capital ratio, rather than prove detrimental, and be earnings accretive. \"We have tried to be very disciplined in the way we have managed our balance sheet and you should assume those disciplines remain in place,\" Varley said.</p> <p>He underlined how important it had been to get the deal done quickly to prevent an exodus of staff and clients. Staff have been clearing their desks and walking out with bags or cardboard boxes full of possessions since it became apparent on Sunday evening that the firm was finished. He said that, as far as he was aware, Barclays was the only bidder.</p> <p>A deadline for completing the deal to buy the North American business has been set for a week today.</p> <p>In addition, Barclays is paying $1.5bn for the Lehman headquarters, a glass and steel tower just north of Times Square in New York, and two data centres in New Jersey. The bank said the price represented the buildings' market values.</p> <p>The agreement is being supported by certain \"strategic\" investors in the bank, who have agreed to subscribe to at least $1bn of new equity. Barclays did not name which investors would be supporting the deal, but Qatar Investment Authority, China Development Bank and Singapore's Temasek are among its large shareholders.</p> <p>Lehman renewed contact with Barclays on Monday afternoon to see if it would still be interested in some of its assets. Diamond, who led the failed weekend negotiations to take control of Lehman, had remained in the US and worked through the night to hammer out an agreement.</p> <p>The bank filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which provides protection from creditors while it liquidates its business. The operations in the UK were put into administration and staff reacted with shock and anger as they turned up for work on Monday and were told, in most cases, to go back home again.</p> <p>Barclays has grown its investment banking division rapidly under Diamond's 10 years at the top. He was involved in disbanding the bank's last disastrous foray into global financial markets, BZW, and there have been some concerns the bank might repeat mistakes.</p> <p>Barclays said the deal would give it a top three position in US capital markets. The firm said it would also extend Barclays Capital's range of investment banking products, with the addition of Lehman's strong M&amp;A and equity capital markets franchises in the US. The deal will result in a significant lift to the amount of earnings from the US. </p> <p>\"We will now have the best team and most productive culture across the world's major financial markets, backed by the resources of an integrated universal bank,\" Diamond said.</p>",
  "<p>At the Paralympic closing ceremony in Beijing, China's dark-suited leaders sat stiff and largely unsmiling, despite the fact that the Olympics season has now concluded without disaster. One might even have assumed these men were strangers, because they scarcely acknowledged each other. China's leaders don't like to reveal their emotions in public, nor do they like to reveal the state of relations within the leadership. Their unity is a symbolic echo of the \"harmonious society\" they say they are trying to create. </p> <p>\"This year has been like going to war for China,\" a Beijing taxi driver said to me. He listed the stresses on the leadership: the snowstorms that paralysed much of southern China at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year\">lunar new year</a>, the earthquake that devastated large areas of Sichuan, and the Olympic Games. He might have added to his list the riots in Tibet and the attacks on the Olympic torch, both foreign policy crises for the leadership.</p> <p>Even before the Paralympics closed, a new test for the leadership raised its ugly head. Some 6,200 babies who were fed contaminated milk powder have become ill, and three have died. Tests have now shown that milk powder produced by 22 manufacturers contains melamine. The question now is who knew what, and when? After a series of scandals, food safety is a highly sensitive subject, and newspapers around the country were told to keep silent on the subject during the Olympics. </p> <p>Common sense suggests that the leadership's public harmony must be more discordant in private. Only the leaders know what financial and political capital they have lavished on the Olympics, but it is obviously immense. As they emerge from the games they might wish they had spent less. The situation in Sichuan remains dire, as whole communities must be rehoused. Inflation is running at an official 6%, the stock market has dropped, and the housing market may follow. If economic growth is to be maintained, the country's leaders must feed industry with a constant river of oil. </p> <p>China is not immune to global economic tremors. But here in Beijing, it is the economic boom and its attendant promise of constantly improving living standards that has kept the Communist party in power for the past two decades. <br> I think ultimately the Beijing Olympics will mark an important point in China's political development. In order to keep the city clear of protesters during the games, the party had to launch a crisis-management campaign nationwide, warning provincial officials that if protesters came from their provinces to Beijing and disrupted the games, those officials would suffer. </p> <p>And yet some dissenting voices have been heard. Not from ordinary people with grievances, but from some of the people closest to the Olympics. Zhang Yimou, the director of the opening and closing ceremonies, said the only other country in the world that could put on such mass displays was North Korea. Zhang made loyal noises, but discussing political intervention in cultural events comes close to revealing state secrets.<br> <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7545344.stm\">Ai Weiwei</a>, the Chinese artist, and consultant for the design of the Bird's Nest stadium, has over the past few weeks attacked the Chinese leadership repeatedly and unambiguously with regard to the crackdown on dissent in the run-up to and during the games. Unlike the two old ladies threatened with a labour camp for asking to hold a protest in the official protest zone, Ai Weiwei has got away with it so far because of his fame.</p> <p>When <a href=\"http://www.chenqigang.com/chenqigang/FE/\">Chen Qigang</a>, the musical director of the opening ceremony, revealed to the world the lip-synching scandal \u2013 in which Yang Peiyi was banished to the wings because of her bad teeth while Lin Miaoke moved a more pleasing mouth to Yang's voice \u2013 was he really unaware of the political fire he was stoking? </p> <p>Meanwhile, and even in the midst of Olympic fervour, China's news agencies have been giving space to calls for an end to state investment in the training of elite athletes, saying it is too expensive and not good for children taken from their families to undergo intensive coaching. For these dissenting voices to be given space on state-run propaganda vehicles like Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency, suggests that there are people in very senior positions who want to see more open debate. </p> <p>There is a rapidly developing variety of opinion in China now, and a minefield of different vested interests. There is ambivalence, complexity, secrecy, and information flowing through an only partially disabled internet. There is nationalism, and stadiums still ringing from the cheers of Chinese fans for US teams. Can a secretive and anxious leadership stay united in the face of such diversity and such challenges? In my view, now the forced unity of the Olympics is over, the cracks may begin to show.</p>",
  "<p>Nick Clegg's first annual conference speech as Liberal Democrat leader was today hailed by party grandees and delegates alike as sending a clear message to ordinary people that the party is \"on their side\".</p> <p>Clegg's relaxed style, delivering the speech while walking around the stage, was praised for its contrast to the more formal approach of his predecessor, Sir Menzies Campbell.</p> <p>The party president, Simon Hughes, said the speech, at the end of five days of debate in Bournemouth, had addressed \"the concerns of real Britons, of real people, of real families who are facing a very uncertain time\".</p> <p>Hughes, who acknowledged the party had been through a turbulent period because of recent leadership contests to replace Campbell and Charles Kennedy, said Clegg was a more effective communicator than his predecessors.</p> <p>\"The truth of the matter is that Nick is much more comfortable as a communicator in his way than any of his predecessors. He is a great communicator \u2014 that is why we chose him as leader.\"</p> <p>Sir Menzies said the speech was a \"testament to Nick Clegg's liberalism\".</p> <p>He said: \"I'm pretty certain he has got all the qualities necessary to make sure that the progress he described and defined is going to be achieved.\"</p> <p>Clegg had a \"more relaxed style of talking to people directly\" in the \"modern way\" rather than delivering a declaration from a lectern, Sir Menzies said.</p> <p>Former party leader Lord Ashdown described Clegg's address as a \"tour de force\". </p> <p>\"It was exceptional as a first speech,\" he said. \"If you compare it to my first speech [as leader] in Blackpool I think it was a real tour de force. I think the party is his now. You know a clear leader when he knows where he wants to take the party and takes the people with him. He has really done it.\"</p> <p>The environment spokesman, Steve Webb, said: \"I thought it was very powerful. It was a unifying speech. We come from a range of traditions and emphases, and I thought Nick pushed the button for everybody.\"</p> <p>The home affairs spokesman, Chris Huhne, who was defeated by Mr Clegg in the contest for the leadership, added: \"It was an inspirational speech.</p> <p>\"It was the culmination of a splendid conference which has really set a very clear sense of direction for the party.</p> <p>\"Nick has staked out the battleground for the next election, which is now that Labour is finished as a political force where is the choice for British people going to be?</p> <p>\"And it has been staked out between a party that believes in fairness, wants to give people more of their own money for lower income earners and middle income earners, and not, like the Conservatives, only the top 6% of income earners.</p> <p>\"It was a rallying cry for a crusade for real change at the next election.\"</p> <p>The Lib Dems' health spokesman, Norman Lamb, said Clegg defined the party as the champion of social justice. \"The assertion that we are the only party capable of delivering social justice is a bold one but it is the right case to be made because Labour has ultimately failed.\"</p> <p>The family spokeswoman, Susan Kramer, said the speech captured the concerns of her constituents, her neighbours, and her friends. \"I thought that was the best leader's speech I have heard,\" she said. </p> <p>\"It was really important to re-emphasise the tax cutting agenda. It recognises what people are going through.\"<br> Delegates were also wooed by the speech. Lib Dem delegate Marion Bland, a councillor from Litchfield, Staffs, said: \"It contained all the aspects I wanted him to discuss. I do not agree with everything though, because I am on the left of the party.\"</p> <p>She added: \"I agree with the tax cuts but I would like anything that is left over to go into public services.\"</p> <p>Michael Peacock, from Godalming in Surrey, said Clegg's address was the best speech he had ever heard. \"It was very honest and it hit all the right buttons.\"</p> <p>Jenny Barnes, also from Godalming, said: \"I had seen some reports claiming he has presented himself as to the right of the Conservatives, but he has definitely positioned us as the party of social justice, which is how I saw the tax cutting move.\"</p> <p>David Brown, a councillor from Poole, said: \"He stated all the important things that we believe in as Liberal Democrats, particularly on the economy issues, and the solutions that we are proposing to solve the difficulties. Other parties do not seem to have a clue about that. I like the tax cut plans. It is what is needed at the moment.\"</p>",
  "<p>The government is cracking down on so-called suicide websites by tightening the law to prohibit the promotion of suicide online.</p> <p>The move follows growing concern over the role of the internet in dozens of teenage deaths, the Ministry of Justice said today.</p> <p>While it is already illegal under the 1961 Suicide Act to promote suicide, no website owner has been prosecuted and ministers want to rewrite the law to clarify that it also applies to the internet.</p> <p>The justice minister Maria Eagle said: \"There is no magic solution to protecting vulnerable people online. Updating the language of the Suicide Act, however, should help to reassure people that the internet is not a lawless environment and that we can meet the challenges of the digital world.</p> <p>\"It is important, particularly in an area of such wide public interest and concern, for the law to be expressed in terms that everyone can understand.\"</p> <p>Eagle said the move would help internet service providers police the sites they host.</p> <p>A spate of deaths in Bridgend, south Wales, raised fears teenagers were using the web to plan and discuss killing themselves.</p> <p>A recent study found people searching online for ways to kill themselves were more likely to come across sites encouraging them to take their own lives than those offering help.</p> <p>Today's move follows a government report from the parenting expert Tanya Byron on child safety on the web.

Anthony Langan, the charity's public affairs manager, said: \"We are pleased that no specific ban on websites is proposed, as it would be unworkable and questionable in terms of freedom of speech.</p> <p>\"The next step must be to understand how and why people use the internet to find out about issues like suicide and develop our services in response to the results.\"</p> <p>*<em>If you would like to talk to someone, in confidence, call <a href=\"http://www.samaritans.org/\">the Samaritans</a> on 08457 90 90 90</em></p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_&amp;_Order\">Law &amp; Order</a> is the only American TV show to have started in 1990 and still be going strong. Its detectives and DAs may have had limited success in keeping the bad guys off the streets of Manhattan, but in its 18 years the programme has become a global phenomenon and spawned two successful spin-offs, <a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/Law_and_Order_Special_Victims_Unit/\">Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/Law_&amp;_Order:_Criminal_Intent/\">Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent</a>.</p> <p>Unlike other legal dramas, which show either police procedure or lawyers' negotiations, L&amp;O broke new ground by portraying the judicial process from the discovery of a crime (usually murder or rape, often both) to the outcome of the trial. This keeps things interesting and gives viewers an insight into all of the considerations and complications of making a case.</p> <p>Sure, it can be samey sometimes. After almost two decades, there aren't many story lines that will still surprise viewers. But all the Law &amp; Order franchises are well-made and fast-paced, capturing New York in all its gritty glory whilst somehow managing to make the city seem glamorous at the same time.</p> <p>So it's understandable that producers would want to emulate its success: countless New York cop dramas (from <a href=\"http://www.thirdwatch.co.uk/\">Third Watch</a> to <a href=\"http://www.cbs.com/primetime/without_a_trace/\">Without a Trace</a>) have tried to recapture the Law &amp; Order magic, but none has bettered it.</p> <p>The last spin-off anyone would expect to see (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/garethmcleanblog/2008/jan/04/dowereallyneedlaworderlo \">well, apart from Gareth McLean in January</a>) is a UK version of the show. But according to an announcement <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/sep/08/itv.television?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=media\">earlier this week</a>, that is exactly what ITV is planning. This new programme will throw together ex-Dr Who companion <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLnSphQ88_w\">Freema Agyeman</a> and ex-Corrie star <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\" u9ktcdfmz1g\" \">Bradley Walsh</a>, replicate the American show's title and format and hope the results spell success. More likely they will spell disaster. Walsh's cheeky Cockney copper is hardly the kind of character who would show up in an L&amp;O script.</p> <p>Although <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\" nnn_bgxzkxm\" \">Dick Wolf</a>, creator of the original series, has pledged that his company will co-produce the British version, I can't see it giving the American show any competition in the ratings stakes, even on this side of the pond.</p> <p>In fact, it only shows how far ITV is behind the BBC. Instead of original content like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_on_Mars_(TV_series)\">Life on Mars</a>, ITV is trying to re-work an American stalwart without the acting talent or production values to back it up.</p> <p>From the camp and improbable <a href=\"http://www.midsomermurders.net/\">Midsomer Murders</a>, to the overblown drama of <a href=\"http://www.thebill.com/page.asp?partid=1\">The Bill</a>, British cop shows have always lagged behind their American counterparts, managing to look cheap and unrealistic instead of dramatic and lifelike. British police dramas are usually ploddy (no pun intended) and slow.

  "<p>Comments in a recent survey from vice-chancellors from around the world, complaining of lack of funding and resources, have a familiar ring. </p> <p>Perhaps not surprisingly, these kinds of problems are felt more keenly by universities in developing countries, where shortfalls in public funding have been compounded by years of underinvestment. </p> <p>A lack of resources affects all areas of a university, from fitting out laboratories to attracting academics. As one vice-chancellor from the Caribbean said: \"Inadequate funding has resulted in a physical facility that requires rehabilitation, an inability to attract and retain highly qualified staff and inadequate learning resources [for] distance education programmes, laboratory and research equipment.\"</p> <p>The findings come from a survey of vice-chancellors and senior staff from 81 institutions across 22 countries conducted by the <a href=\"http://www.acu.ac.uk/\">Association of Commonwealth Universities</a>.</p> <p>Answers revealed a substantial degree of consensus around the issues of principal concern - the overlapping themes of funding and resources, internationalisation and competition, teaching and learning, human resources, research and outreach. </p> <p>Universities across the Commonwealth face tough new challenges. They must contend with the rising pressure on public resources but as businesses, they also need to sustain themselves in a more competitive, market-oriented and international context.</p> <p>They are under pressure to generate alternative sources of income, not only through student fees but by research or consulting and from charitable donations. </p> <p>However, generating funding outside of the public sphere creates its own set of issues. One UK respondent said: \"The potential increase in [UK] student fees after 2009, accompanied by students increasingly perceiving themselves as customers, presents a key challenge to all UK higher education institutions in terms of improving their market articulation and the responsiveness of academic process and services.\"</p> <p>More starkly, a respondent from Zambia referred to the inability to raise tuition as a particular problem in light of static government funding: \"We have trebled the number of students, but infrastructure has not changed since the 1980s \u2026 Funding is not available from government for infrastructure and public universities cannot charge economic rates of fees because it will create strikes by students and the government will not allow increases in fees.\" </p> <p>Unsubsidised international students have long provided a much needed cash injection to universities and competition for these students is fierce. While comments on the theme of internationalisation and competition extended beyond student recruitment and revenue generation, it is telling that these comments were most prevalent among respondents from countries with a net inflow of international students and where income from cross-border provision is significant \u2013 for example the UK, Australia and Canada. </p> <p>A particular point of contention concerned the increasingly influential role of international league tables, especially among potential students. Respondents from both Australia and Canada referred to these and criticised their methodologies.</p> <p>One Australian respondent stated: \"[International] ranking is here to stay but it remains very problematic\u2026.global comparisons should be possible but it is important that we develop relevant and robust methodologies for providing comparisons across the Commonwealth and more widely.\" </p> <p>Market forces are shaping the operating context of universities in a way that was simply not the case a generation ago. </p> <p>Higher education is viewed as a service sector and universities have to demonstrate they are fit for purpose and responsive to the changing needs and demands of the sector whether these arise from an enlarged and diversified student demographic, changing technological capability or an outward focussed research agenda. These are not purely questions of academic integrity and relevance, as has always been the case, but of 'customer service'. As one vice-chancellor from Bangladesh explained, universities need greater flexibility to \"open, close, expand and contract courses in response to market demand\".</p> <p>It is no surprise therefore that the other priority areas emerging in the survey, such as teaching and learning, research, and human resources, relate to changes and adaptations in the core functions of the university, and the staff who provide them. </p> <p>One comment drawn from the UK referred to the need to respond to a range of societal shifts such as \"more flexible working patterns, appetites for learning throughout our lives, time poverty and income prosperity, as well as changing demographics\". </p> <p>\"All [of which] point to models of higher education provision that shift from an 18-25 intake sitting in classrooms and labs to learning that adapts to individual and targeted circumstances\u2026[and]\u2026demand new approaches to learning and knowledge generation and dissemination. </p> <p>Universities must be responsive to the multiple communities they serve, whether those communities are local, national or international; how they do so is their unifying challenge. The survey highlights that contexts and missions might vary, but the issues universities face are remarkably similar. </p> <p>\u0095 Jay Kubler is the senior research officer at the Policy Research Unit of the ACU</p>",
  "<p>It could not have been more ironic. On the very day that South African President Thabo Mbeki finally sealed a desperately needed <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7617731.stm\">power-sharing deal</a> in neighbouring Zimbabwe between the ruling Zanu-PF and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, his own ANC is <a href=\"http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=6&amp;art_id=nw20080917141408106C767629\">debating</a> whether to impeach him for behaving autocratically.</p> <p>It sums up the legacy of a man who promised so much, in terms of building democracy at home and in Africa, but who failed woefully to live up to his own rhetorical flourishes. The ANC's national working committee, which runs its day-to-day affairs, has now agreed to fire Mbeki, pending legal advice.</p> <p>Mbeki had hoped that delivering a deal in Zimbabwe would help restore some of the lost credibility at home and in his ruling ANC. This is not to be. Mbeki sees this Zimbabwean deal as a vindication of his much derided \"quiet diplomacy\" over Western gunboat diplomacy, and finally a victory for his personal dictum of \"African solutions for Africa's problems\". But many within the ANC believe a tougher approach earlier on may have ultimately been less costly. </p> <p>Judge Chris Nicholson's judgment last Friday, which temporary dismissed Jacob Zuma's corruption trial because the prosecutors did not follow the proper procedures, also damned Mbeki for using public institutions to trip up opponents, giving his local opponents the ammunition they have long been waiting for to dismiss him. </p> <p>Mbeki's biggest error in the last decade was to naively believe Zimbabwean strongman Robert Mugabe's promises of better behaviour, only to be betrayed later as the old tyrant backtracked. </p> <p>The fact that this is a deal worked out by Africans themselves should not obscure its inherent flaws. The big worry remains that in the power-sharing agreement in Zimbabwe, like the one in Kenya, the opposition party and leader that actually won the poll got short-changed, while the sitting leader and government that cheated are richly rewarded. </p> <p>That itself is a recipe for future instability. It means African dictators can rig the vote but retain their power by threatening more violence and by agreeing to African mediation. Instead of a short, transitional government Mugabe is now entrenched for a full term in office. </p> <p>Admittedly, Mugabe has ceded some presidential powers and given Morgan Tsvangirai additional powers as executive prime minister \u2013 on paper, a 50:50 split of power. Control over the security forces has been divided, with Mugabe running the military and intelligence services and Tsvangirai in charge of the police. Tsvangirai also gets the finance department, with responsibility to resuscitate the economy \u2013 driven to the brink of collapse by Mugabe's kleptocracy, back to life. </p> <p>This cannot happen without generous western financial help and support from Zimbabweans in the diaspora who fled Mugabe's terror. All the repressive laws are still on the books. Those that committed human rights abuses are not being prosecuted, neither are their victims being compensated. </p> <p>Mugabe has only agreed to these very minimal concessions because of the hard reality that the state is now bankrupt, and there is no outside financial help forthcoming unless he agreed to share power. The threat of further sanctions tightened the screws more. </p> <p>Among African peers his support dwindled as it became clear that his bogus claims to fight western domination on behalf of other Africans was shown for what is: a fake, used to disguise his and his junta's fact looting of Zimbabwe and terrorising of its citizens. </p> <p>By supporting Mugabe instead of the long-suffering people of Zimbabwe, African leaders undermined their own fight against global inequality in politics, trade and finance. This has been clear for some time now to the ruling ANC in South Africa, although evidently not to Mbeki. When the party pointed this out to Mbeki, he characteristically ignored the counsel. </p> <p>For some time now, the ANC rightly believed that increasing pressure on Mugabe and his junta was the best way to prevent further loss of life, economic decline and more refugees fleeing into South Africa. </p> <p>The ANC had changed from seeing Zanu-PF and other errant liberation movements as friends only because they, too, fought colonial powers, no matter how brutal their record in power. Mbeki ignored this. </p> <p>The ANC endorsed MDC and its leader Morgan Tsvangirai as the legitimate winners of the March 2008 elections, and wanted them to be appropriately rewarded \u2013 not Mugabe. With the Zimbabwean deal, Mbeki may have prolonged Mugabe's stay in power, but failed to do so for himself.</p>",
  "<p>It is extraordinary, that in the middle of the most <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">devastating financial crisis</a> since the late 1920s, Labour should be struggling with the idea of whether or not to <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&amp;sid=auGnzEWdkgE4&amp;refer=europe\">change its leader</a>.</p> <p>Whatever the failings of Gordon Brown, the last thing needed now is some sort of contest for his threadbare mantle. </p> <p>It is not as though the conflict between Blairites and Brownites were a replay of wars between <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghibelline\">Guelphs and Ghibellines</a>, factions divided by irreconcilable loyalties to pope and emperor. Quite the contrary. These are personal animosities. If they were rooted in doctrinal differences, there might be some point to the present disorder, and the possibility of a resolution. Perhaps Labour is simply mirroring the turbulence of the global economic system, which, like events in the party, seem to have outrun the capacity of mere human beings to deal with them.</p> <p>Why Brown \u2013 the \"architect\" of the 10 good years \u2013 is being blamed for the ending of the recent long interval of prosperity is not clear. How could he have forestalled the sub-prime mortgage crisis, or the opaque \"financial innovations\" of investment banks, the mysterious world of derivatives, the selling-on of bundles of loans insured against failure, which are all now fast unwinding and revealing to the world once more what used to be called by archaic Leftists the \"true nature of capitalism\". </p> <p>The hounding of Brown is irrational and punitive; a bit like the ruinous banking system \u2013 non-performing loans meet a non-performing prime minister. But what could a new leader conceivably do? What miracles would he or (less likely) she have to perform? The electoral collapse of Labour merely mimics the demolition of the financial stability on which its fragile popularity was predicated. </p> <p>What we are seeing is not the recklessness of MPs, who feel the game is up and their seats already lost in an election already won by Cameron. We are witnessing a backlash against the enfeeblement of political power of those in what increasingly appears to be nominal governance, and their forfeit of the ability to intervene significantly in the affairs, not of the world, but even of our own country, buffeted as we are by the tempests of global confusion. It makes nonsense of Brown's alleged sagacious stewardship of \"our\" economy: it turns it isn't really ours at all, but a sort of outpost of somebody else's ill-managed imperium. </p> <p>No wonder Brown has been at pains to resuscitate a sense of Britishness \u2013 paradoxically also inspired by America, the source and origin of all our hopes and all our woes \u2013 with the union flag fluttering from the rooftops infants learning to lisp hymns to Britannia. This is a doomed heroic effort to reclaim territory irrecoverably lost, since it is clear we are at the mercy of forces over which we have no control at all. </p> <p>We owe the 10 years of prosperity and growing disposable income to the sleight of hand of the the conjurors of global financial markets, the boy-wizards of infantile omnipotence, the occultists of monetary illusion. Brown's eagerness to claim credit for that happy time stands in contrast with his desire to disclaim responsibility for the confusion for which his austere and joyless presence is \u2013 unjustly \u2013 now being blamed.</p> <p>The Labour party \u2013 of all political parties \u2013 ought to have been ready with some plausible account of what has happened. It ought to have had some narrative, some fable or story of why things are falling apart. Instead, we have to read the indecipherable script of financial journalists, whose language (apart that of a few experts in translation, like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/nov/22/comment.politics\">Larry Elliot</a>) is about as revealing as the destination of the securitised instruments in which bad loans were mysteriously whisked into outer darkness. </p> <p>The Labour party ought to have stepped in with a swift forensic analysis of what needs to be done to reverse the excesses of a deregulation over which they were only too happy preside. But New Labour merged with Old Capitalism, a union in which it became not so much a sleeping as a moribund partner. </p> <p>Labour, most people may have forgotten, owes its very existence to a critique of capitalism; a capacity it long ago forfeited when it decided to abrogate power in favour of the febrile unreason of markets. Labour voluntarily, of its own free will, submitted to the mutable wisdom of money and the short wit of wealth. No wonder it can do nothing but fall upon itself in impotent, fratricidal rage. Anger, once directed outwards, against injustice and exploitation, now has nowhere else to go. </p> <p>Even as workers are dismissed summarily from their jobs, their monthly salary cancelled, carrying in crates the contents of their cleared desks, the small paraphernalia of abridged permanent posts, Labour is struck uncharacteristically dumb. As other people anxiously await the next shake-out of labour, the next bank failure, the collapse of their holiday firms, the inflationary bite into the their small incomes, and the Liberal Democrats decide that they are the New Conservatives, Labour is powerless to provide the competent radical voice which the urgency of the hour requires. </p> <p>The madness of the markets seems to have entered the soul of New Labour, faced as it is with Old Capitalism, whose nature is far less changeable than that of its sometime enemies. </p> <p>If Labour cannot even tell a story any more, as Gisela Stuart says, this is because its tale has already been told. It is difficult not to see in the present convulsions of New Labour an acting out of the death-wish implicit in its abrogation of its quarrel with capitalism, a suicidal impulse given its final quietus when it called itself New, not so long ago, but in what now look like the old days.</p>",

The early symptoms appeared to be shared by all of the main political parties and many in the industry and, by the end of last week in the Scottish media, we had a full-scale epidemic on our hands. The source of the outbreak was quickly identified as broadcasting.</p> <p>No one now seems to disagree that something is seriously wrong with the state of broadcasting in Scotland and the commission has been able to shed some light on the subject - the first time the industry has ever been looked at in this way. </p> <p>Our final report sets out an ambitious and, we think, compelling vision for the future of the industry in the digital age. We talk about the economic, cultural and democratic importance of broadcasting. We paint an optimistic but realistic picture of a transformed production sector creating world-class content for worldwide audiences. We point out that the best way to predict the future is to create it.</p> <p>The headline-grabber from our report (and the cause of much of the consensus) is our idea for a new Scottish network, a public service broadcaster combining a linear television channel with an extensive and innovative online platform. </p> <p>This is in effect a solution to several pressing problems: We need the Scottish network to provide secure and sustainable public service competition for the BBC in Scotland; to produce the greater range and volume of Scottish content that audiences in Scotland clearly desire; and to create outlets for the new talent and new ideas that currently struggle to find broadcast opportunities, from which creators, audiences and markets can all benefit.</p> <p>And the reach of this proposal goes beyond Scotland's borders: the network would of course be available throughout the UK.</p> <p>In fact, much of our vision sees Scotland playing its part in the global and UK markets. The industry is not what it should have been but we know what it can be and what it will take to get it there.</p> <p>Which is why we also had a lot to say about how and why the UK public service broadcasters should commission more of their network television programmes from this part of the country. The BBC have already made a commitment to move its share of spending in Scotland to a level that is more consistent with our share of population (close to 9%). The move is very welcome - although we would like it to move a little faster.</p> <p>We also call on Channel 4 to make a similar commitment and to be less metrocentric in its culture and its commissioning. Outside London, 4 is not so much a brand name as a head count.</p> <p>There were perfectly good reasons - historical and technological - for why broadcasting was always so heavily concentrated in London. But the explanations for the past must not be allowed to become the excuses for the future. The cultural and economic benefits of network television production are so extensive and so obvious that they must be more equitably distributed around the UK by the avowedly public service broadcasters.</p> <p>There is wide recognition in Scotland that more must be done to develop and support the indigenous production sector. Public service interventions of the kind we have outlined can provide the leverage to create companies capable of competing in those fast-growing multimedia, multiplatform and multinational markets.</p> <p>Broadcasting in this part of the UK has consistently lagged behind the other creative industries. Scotland is home to perhaps the world's most successful cultural product (Harry Potter), the world's most successful video game (the Grand Theft Auto series) and the world's biggest and best arts festivals (Edinburgh). In recent years there has been an explosion of creativity in music, visual arts and theatre - we have the UNESCO City of Literature and the UNESCO City of Music. It's time now for television production to catch up - in domestic and global markets.</p> <p>The Scottish Broadcasting Commission made 22 recommendations in all and we are keen to see all of them implemented. But whatever the outcome, it is already clear that the debate about broadcasting in Scotland has moved on to a new level of ambition and engagement. This is a turning point and there is no way back to the neglect and underinvestment of previous years. </p> <p>Having had a warm and wide welcome for our final report in Scotland last week, we now look to Ofcom and the DCMS to endorse our conclusions and take them forward, and to the viewing public and those in the industry to continue to build the sense of momentum. Consensus - it's highly contagious.</p>",

  "<p>Here's an interesting fact: despite being recognised through their distance running as among the finest endurance athletes on the planet, no Kenyan or Ethiopian has ever ridden the Tour de France. In fact, no Kenyan, Ethiopian or black African of any nation has ever become a professional cyclist. </p> <p>Team GB's prodigious success in the saddle in Beijing drew a degree of rather measly sniping along these lines. It seems unfair to disparage the achievements of individual athletes, who can only beat the field in front of them. But the fact remains. Africans don't cycle - and for a variety of reasons, mainly to do with habit and tradition, but also things like start-up costs and prohibitively expensive racing technology.</p> <p>For the first time, however, there is a suggestion this might not always be the case. Last month two amateur Kenyan cyclists, Zakayo Nderi, a shoe-shiner by trade, and Samwel Myangi, a 24-year-old bicycle taxi rider, performed a time trial on the Alpe D'Huez, a blue chip Tour stage finish. This is a serious test: 13.8km at an average gradient of 7.9% with 21 hairpin bends. </p> <p>Zakayo and Myangi rode in a traditional Thursday morning mass time-trial. After a hugely promising 46-minute opening stab, they emerged with best times of 42 minutes for Zackary and 43 minutes for Myangi. These would have placed the riders comfortably within the top 50 in the 2004 Tour de France time trial, five minutes down on Lance Armstrong's winning mark that year. </p> <p>At this point it's worth stressing a few things about the two riders. Neither had ever been to Europe before. It had taken an exhausting 18-month struggle just to secure 20-day visas to enter the country. Neither has had any coaching - either in terms of physical conditioning or the technical business of the bike itself. These are complete amateurs. Their only previous cycling experience involved riding around pot-holed Kenyan roads on the infamous Black Mamba bike, a 20kg beast with no gears. </p> <p>As novice first attempts, the times on the Alpe are stunning. Not to mention a huge fillip for the driving force behind getting them there, Nicholas Leong, a cycling enthusiast and long-time Tour de France follower. \"I'm doing this as a fan,\" he says of a project that has so far eaten up all his savings from his primary career as a commercial photographer. It's a process that has also involved a great deal of faith. </p> <p>\"I'd seen the first black players turning up in English football and the first black African athletes winning marathons in the 1990s,\" he says. \"I always expected an African to turn up in cycling and it didn't happen.\" </p> <p>Leong's inspiration ultimately came from the Singapore marathon. The men's race has been won by a Kenyan runner for the past six years. In 2006 13 of the first 15 places were filled by Kenyans, who were in town as part of their annual tour of the global road-racing circuit. </p> <p>The day after the race Leong bought an air ticket to Nairobi, gambling, correctly, that the runners he had seen would be leaving on the same plane: \"I said to them, 'wherever you're going, I'm coming with you'.\"</p> <p>Fortunately, his companions on the flight were from Eldoret, a town that sits 2100 metres above sea level and has provided the rump of Kenya's recent distance running talent. It was there that Leong began trying to lure some of the town's amateur runners into the switch to cycling. \"I wasted a lot of time doing that,\" he says. 'They weren't interested.\"</p> <p>In the end he came across a local cycling club whose members staged ad hoc races. Leong picked out the four most talented riders and offered to train them for a couple of months in Singapore (\"I just gave them a bike and said 'ride as fast as you can'\"). Eventually the two quickest, Zakayo and Myangi, were taken to France for their shot at the Alpe. </p> <p>Zakayo's English is halting. He says training has been \"very difficult\" but \"exciting\" and that he \"would like to compete in the Tour de France, that is my dream\". </p> <p>Dreams have been important in all this. Before meeting Leong Zakayo would get up at 5am and train on his own, cycling 50km before doing a full day's work as a shoe-shine. He had no clear purpose in mind. Shortly before Leong arrived his wife had had a dream that someone would come and take him away on a mission. And so it proved. </p> <p>The brief spell in Singapore saw the Kenyans sit on a proper racing bike for the first time. \"It was much faster than a Black Mamba,\" Zakayo chuckles. \"It felt really good. At first I did have some crashes. It was just so fast.\"</p> <p>Before the time trial Zakayo had another dream, one in which he killed a lion. If the lion wasn't exactly slain this time around, it certainly ought to be looking slightly warily over its shoulder. \"I can go faster, definitely, much faster,\" he says, matter-of-factly. \"Now I know the course I can go much faster. It was all new for me before. Next time I will be much better.\" </p> <p>Leong's goal is to set up a permanent presence in Kenya, an academy with regular competitions, which might act as a feeder system for professional teams. For that to happen he needs sponsors, coaches, anybody with expertise who might be willing to take a punt on a stunning novice performance in France. </p> <p>\"I started this because the people with the most potential have not been given the chance to cycle,\" he says. \"There's so much talent there, even if it's not this generation of riders who manage to do something amazing, maybe the next will.\"</p> <p>Leong is certainly a trailblazer. And one, perhaps, with the tide of history on his side. </p> <p>By way of an example: the first ever Singapore marathon was won by Britain's Ray Crabbe in 1982. It was 15 years before Africans began to compete. In 2006 a Kenyan, Elijah Mbogo, won it in a time over 23 minutes quicker than Crabbe's. </p> <p>Cycling, you have been warned.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa+business/business\">US financial system</a> is caught in a destructive liquidation trap that has falling asset prices cause financial distress, in turn compelling further asset sales and price declines. If unaddressed, it risks sending the economy into deep recession \u2013 or even depression. </p> <p>Current conditions are the result of bursting of the house-price bubble and the end of two decades of financial exuberance. That exuberance was fostered by a cocktail of forces.</p> <p>First, economic policy replaced wages and productive investment as the engines of growth with debt and asset inflation. Second, greed and free market ideology combined to promote excessive risk-taking and restrain regulators. This was encouraged by audacious claims that mathematical economic models mapped reality and priced uncertainty, making old-fashioned precautions redundant.</p> <p>Recognition of the scale of financial folly has created a rush for liquidity. This is causing huge losses, triggering margin calls and downgrades that cause more selling, damage confidence, and further squeeze credit. That is the paradox of deleveraging. One firm can, but the system as a whole cannot.</p> <p>Having failed to prevent the bubble, regulatory policy is now amplifying its deflation. One reason is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark-to-market\">mark-to-market</a> accounting rules that force companies to take losses as prices fall. A second reason is rigid capital standards.</p> <p>Application of mark-to-market rules in an environment of asset price volatility can create a vicious cycle of accounting losses that drive further price declines and losses. Meanwhile, capital standards require firms to raise more capital when they suffer losses. That compels them to raise money in the midst of a liquidity squeeze, resulting in fresh equity sales that cause further asset price declines.</p> <p>Bad debts will have to be written down, but it is better to write them down in orderly fashion rather than through panicked deleveraging that pulls down good assets too.</p> <p>This suggests regulators should explore ways to relax capital standards and mark-to-market rules. One possibility is permitting temporary discretionary relaxations akin to stock-market circuit breakers.</p> <p>Later, regulators must tackle the underlying problem of price bubbles. Currently, central banks are only able to control bubbles by torpedoing the economy with higher interest rates. New flexible measures of control are needed. One proposal is <a href=\"http://www.thomaspalley.com/?p=37\">asset-based reserve requirements</a>, which systematically apply adjustable margin requirements to the assets of financial firms.</p> <p>The Fed must also lower interest rates, and not just for standard reasons of stimulating spending. Lower short-term rates are needed to make longer term assets (including houses) relatively more attractive, thereby shifting demand to them and putting a bottom to asset price destruction.</p> <p>Fears about a price\u2013wage inflation spiral remain misplaced. Instead, the threat is deep recession triggered by the liquidation trap. If inflation is a wild card, now is the time to use the credibility the Fed has earned. Emergency rate reductions can be reversed when the situation stabilises.</p> <p>The great irony is central banks can produce liquidity without cost. Usually the problem is restraining over-production: today, it is overcoming political concerns about \"bailouts\". Those concerns are legitimate, but they also risk inappropriately restricting liquidity provision and unintentionally imposing the huge costs of deep recession.</p> <p>At the moment the Fed is protecting banks and the treasury-dealer network but leaving the rest of the system in the cold. That is perverse given how the Fed went along with expansion of the non-bank financial system. Instead, the Fed should consider an auction facility that makes longer duration loans available to qualified insurance and finance companies too.</p> <p>The facility's guiding principle should be an expanded version of the Bagehot rule. Accordingly, the Fed would auction funds at punitive rates, with loans being fully collateralised. The goal should be to facilitate the repair of distressed financial companies with minimum market disruption and at no taxpayer expense. By creating an up-front facility, the Fed can get ahead of the curve and reduce need for crisis interventions that are always more costly and disruptive.</p> <p>Among financial conservatives there is a view that financial markets deserve punishment for their \"sins\" and only that will cleanse them. This view is often presented in terms of need to restore market discipline and stay moral hazard.</p> <p>The view from the left is strangely similar, arguing Wall Street \"fat cats\" need to be punished. Asset prices should fall, banks must eat their losses, and all but the most essential financial firms should be allowed to fail.</p> <p>Both views have a moralistic dimension, and both risk unnecessary economic suffering. The mistakes of the past cannot be undone. All that can be done is to minimise their costs and then truly reform the system so that they are not repeated.</p>",

  "<p>Trading was today suspended on Russia's two main stock exchanges after shares fell dramatically for the second day in succession, forcing the central bank in Moscow to intervene.</p> <p>Regulators halted trading at midday (9am BST) on Russia's main stock indices - the rouble-denominated Micex and the dollar-denominated RTS - following a similar suspension yesterday.</p> <p>Russia has been badly affected by the global financial crisis, and has suffered as stocks have sunk in Europe and Asia. But it has also been hit by the rapid fall in oil prices and the flight of foreign investors since the war in Georgia.</p> <p>Today, Russia's finance ministry said it was pumping 1.13 trillion roubles (\u00a324.7bn) into the country's three largest banks - Sberbank, VTB, and Gazprombank - in an attempt to shore up the liquidity of Russia's banking system.</p> <p>Russia's finance minister, Alexei Kudrin, said he did not expect to be forced to use Russia's enormous reserves - the world's third largest - currently held in a stabilisation fund. \"The crisis is not deep enough to warrant that,\" he remarked.</p> <p>Instead, Kudrin suggested that larger banks would now lend to \"small and medium banks\" unable to settle their obligations. On Monday, Russia's central bank and finance ministry injected 510bn roubles into money markets.</p> <p>But there was growing speculation this morning that one of Russia's largest investment banks, KIT finance, could become the next victim of the global crisis. It failed to settle its accounts on Monday and is now in urgent talks to find a strategic investor.</p> <p>Russia's current economic crisis is superficially reminiscent of the 1998 crash, when the rouble was devalued, banks defaulted on loans, and the savings of many ordinary Russians were wiped out overnight.</p> <p>Today, however, analysts pointed out that the Russian economy was much stronger than it was a decade ago. Additionally, it had integrated into the world economy, one of the reasons for its current predicament.</p> <p>\"The mood is changing rapidly. But at the current moment I'm still cautiously optimistic,\" Natalia Orlova, the chief economist at Alfa Bank, told the Guardian this morning. Russia had low foreign debt, a budget surplus and $200bn (\u00a3112bn) in a stabilisation fund, she said. It also had industrial growth last month of almost 5%.</p> <p>She added, however: \"We are clearly facing a confidence crisis in the banking sector. Potentially it might have very serious complications in the long term. But the financial crisis will not be as significant (in Russia) as in the US or western Europe.\"</p> <p>Russian banks face an additional headache next month when quarterly value added tax payments are due, Orlova said. Chris Weafer, the chief strategist at UralSib bank, said investors were panicking, even though Russia's underlying fundamentals were sound.</p> <p>\"The market is trading as if it is close too a default,\" Weafer wrote in a note to investors, quoted by the Associated Press. \"In reality, it has the world's third largest financial reserves and is still earning about $850m every day from crude, oil products and gas exports.\"</p> <p>Yesterday, Russia's markets posted their biggest ever single-day losses, with the RTS falling by 11.5% and the Micex index slumping by 17.5%. This morning, stocks fell still further before they were suspended - with the RTS down 3.9% from yesterday, and the Micex down 4.7%.</p>",
  "<p>Back in July, I wrote here that the US presidential race between Barack Obama and John McCain stood a good chance of being <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/02/usa.uselections2008\">the first post-culture-war campaign</a>. What can I say? I was 180 degrees wrong.</p> <p>McCain's selection of Sarah Palin as his running mate has reignited the US culture wars, and they seem to be burning hotter and brighter than ever. Palin is a polarizing figure straight out of the national id. She opposes abortion rights, questions Darwin and the human connection to global warming, and brims with self-confidence <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/16/opinion/16brooks.html?_r=1&amp;em&amp;oref=slogin\">despite lacking knowledge or experience</a>. She drives Democrats crazy and thrills the GOP base, which was decidedly not thrilled with McCain.</p> <p>The McCain campaign has gone all-out to exploit these ideological fault lines. It has attacked the media as an out-of-touch elite for questioning Palin's fitness for office and asking <a href=\"http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=09&amp;year=2008&amp;base_name=dont_know_much_about_energy\">legitimate questions about her record</a>. It has launched a series of culture-based attacks on Obama touching on sex and celebrity. </p> <p>Obviously, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/15/AR2008091502406.html?hpid=opinionsbox1\">like many people</a>, I misjudged McCain. I expected him to argue for his candidacy on the merits and believed that he could articulate a coherent argument against Obama. America is clearly at a turning point \u2013 the economy is foundering, US influence in the world is declining, and the nation has effectively put off dealing with global warming, the energy crisis, health care and a host of other brewing problems. Yet at the Republican convention in St Paul, McCain's campaign manager Rick Davis <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/thefix/2008/09/mccain_manager_this_election_i.html\">declared</a> that \"this election is not about issues,\" but about a \"composite view\" of the candidates \u2013 in other words, character. </p> <p>If McCain wins, his campaign strategy will turn out to be a giant missed opportunity. Campaigns are opportunities to field-test proposals and themes for the coming four years and build public support for action. This is what Obama's doing. But McCain isn't making much of a positive argument for himself, beyond a few buzzwords like \"maverick.\" Especially on domestic issues, we have virtually no clue what his priorities are, what he wants to do in office.</p> <p>Even on its own terms, McCain's culture war campaign is a scattershot, unfocused and largely mendacious affair. McCain ads have attacked Obama for being a lightweight celebrity, for wanting to teach sex education to kindergarteners (not true), for calling Palin a \"pig\" (also not true). </p> <p>Past GOP culture-war campaigns were negative, divisive and personal. But they made coherent arguments. When George HW Bush attacked Michael Dukakis as an out-of-the-mainstream liberal in 1988, he had a point. Dukakis was a traditional liberal during a time of conservative ascendancy. And the main points of attack were <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Horton\">based on facts</a>: Dukakis did nominally oversee the prison furlough programme that released a killer who then raped and assaulted a woman. He did <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DEEDB1F3EF936A1575BC0A96E948260\">veto a bill</a> requiring the Pledge of Allegiance to the US flag be recited in Massachusetts public schools. In 2004, George W Bush's denunciations of John Kerry as a liberal Washington insider who had trouble articulating clear positions also had the ring of truth.</p> <p>Those campaigns were slick and sophisticated attempts to shape public opinion. By contrast, McCain's ads and rhetoric sound like they're generated by <a href=\"http://www.brianbeutler.com/2008/09/john_mccain_no/\">a bunch of twentysomething Republican bloggers</a>, strung out on caffeine at 3am, each trying to out-snark all the others. The main thing the campaign has going for it is sheer outrageousness \u2013 that is, by hitting every conceivable cultural hot button and <a href=\"http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2008/09/thanks_but_no_thanks.php\">repeating untruths</a> over and over, it will both get an anti-Obama message out and also dominate the news cycle.</p> <p>So far, it's worked \u2013 McCain now has a slight edge in the polls. And the Obama campaign has fumbled, spending much of its time lamely responding to the latest McCain attack. </p> <p>But it's far from clear the culture war will carry McCain to victory. The political fundamentals \u2013 the US economic doldrums and widespread displeasure with the Republican party \u2013 still favor Obama. For many voters worried about their own financial security, those issues will eclipse cultural hot buttons, many of which are remnants of the 1960s and increasingly irrelevant to the challenges of life in 21st century America. </p> <p>It will also be hard for McCain to keep up his current tactics for six weeks straight in the face of mounting media criticism. Presidential campaigns, especially close ones, are notoriously volatile. Polls and the media \"narrative\" can shift dramatically in a short space of time. Even \"outrageous\" can get old fast.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Charles Davis</strong>, economist at the <strong>Centre for Economics and Business Research</strong>, said: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/17/unemploymentdata.recession\">\"Today's figures</a> show the visceral effect of the credit crunch on the labour market. With the demise of Lehman Brothers, the takeover of Merrill Lynch and continuing problems in the City, we expect unemployment to continue rising well into 2009. </p> <p>\"As the evidence of the slowdown finds its way to dole queues up and down the UK, the case for a Bank of England rate cut before the end of the year becomes ever more telling. However, with inflation still above target, we expect the Monetary Policy Committee to wait until inflation has peaked before cutting interest rates. We expect the first rate cut to occur in November \u2013 and to be followed by a series of cuts through 2009. Today's news is likely to see sterling and the FTSE soften as the UK economic outlook becomes bleaker.\"</p> <p><strong>Nigel Meager</strong>, director of the <strong>Institute for Employment Studies</strong>, said: \"As expected, unemployment continues to grow. The claimant count measure has been increasing since January, and there has been a surge in the last couple of months. What's not yet clear is how big the impact on unemployment will be in the months ahead, as the effects of the latest financial crisis feed through into the real economy. Experience from previous recessions is no guide, because there are new labour market factors in play which may help cushion the unemployment impact this time round: migrant workers, who filled many new jobs in recent years, will stop coming, while those already here have started to return; and fewer people over retirement age will be drawn into work.\"</p> <p><strong>Howard Archer</strong> at <strong>Global Insight</strong> said: \"It seems inevitable that extended very weak economic activity and deteriorating business confidence will exact an increasing toll on the labour market over the coming months. Furthermore, employment prospects in the financial sector look increasingly worrying, given the heightened turmoil. Significantly, latest labour hiring surveys are markedly softer, with a September Manpower survey showing that employment intentions are at a nine-year low. In addition, the Bank of England's agents report for September noted that labour demand continued to soften. Consequently, unemployment now looks highly likely to rise above 2 million in 2009.\"</p> <p><strong>David Kern</strong>, economic adviser to the <strong>British Chambers of Commerce</strong>, said: \"Labour market figures highlight the worsening recessionary pressures in the economy. Unemployment is up, employment and vacancies are down.</p> <p>\"With a continued muted increase in average earnings the MPC should find it easier to cut interest rates in October. The UK cannot afford a banking crisis and banks must be supported by adequate liquidity. Authorities in the UK must be as pro-active as those in the US.\"</p> <p><strong>TUC</strong> general secretary <strong>Brendan Barber</strong> said: \"Today's figures show that unemployment is starting to accelerate and it now looks very likely that total unemployment will reach 2 million during 2009. It is more important than ever that we have a co-ordinated economic response to the downturn that puts more money into the pockets of middle and low income families.</p> <p>\"At the same time the Bank of England must play its part. It is clear that deflation is a much more pressing threat than inflation, and interest rates should be cut.\"</p>",
  "<p>The number of people claiming unemployment benefit last month saw its biggest jump since 1992 when the UK was last in recession, official data out today showed.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics said that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/interactive/2008/aug/15/unemployment\">claimant count</a> level for August increased by 32,500 to reach 904,900. </p> <p>On the wider Labour Force Survey measure, joblessness rose by 81,000 to 1.72 million between May and July, the largest increase since 1999. The jobless rate in Britain rose by 0.2% to 5.5% in the three months to July, again the worst level since 1992. The ONS said the trend on both the claimant count and the wider number of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/11/recession.unemploymentdata\">jobless</a> was increasing.</p> <p>The number of workers in manufacturing fell by 42,000 in the latest quarter to reach 2.87 million, the lowest figure since records began 30 years ago. </p> <p>There was also the first fall for more than a year in the UK's employment level, which fell 16,000 to 29.54 million in the three months to July. </p> <p>Howard Archer at Global Insight said: \"It seems inevitable that extended very weak economic activity and deteriorating business confidence will exact an increasing toll on the labour market over the coming months.

It said that total unemployment could hit two million people by next year, partly as a result of the government's tougher benefits regime. </p> <p>TUC general secretary Brendan Barber said: \"Employment levels have remained high despite the recent economic turbulence and are nowhere near the dark days of 1992, when nearly three million people were unemployed. </p> <p>\"However, the TUC is concerned that unemployment has been sneaking up in the last few months and it's up to unions, employers and the Government to halt and reverse this trend as soon as possible.\" </p> <p>\"With unemployment rising, people are looking to the Government for a response and economic measures will be far more welcome than yet another round of welfare reforms.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, average earnings increased by 3.5% in the year to July, 0.1% up from the previous month but well below the 4.5% level that the inflation-conscious Bank of England considers compatible with low inflation. </p> <p>\"Although earning growth picked up modestly in July, it remained moderate and was broadly reassuring for the Bank of England. Headline annual earnings growth was limited to 3.7% in July itself and to 3.5% in the three months to July. The underlying rate was also contained at 3.8% and 3.7% respectively. This is well below the 4.5% level generally considered consistent with the Bank of England's 2.0% inflation target,\" said Archer.</p> <p>\"However, a key question for the Bank of England is will wage growth remain contained given sharply higher inflation and elevated inflation expectations?\"</p>",

The Bank of England can play a key role in helping to reinvigorate the economy by cutting interest rates this month.\"</p> <p>The employment minister, Stephen Timms, said the UK was facing up to global economic challenges alongside many other countries, and insisted the foundations of the UK labour market remained \"strong\".</p> <p>He said: \"Our welfare reforms are about making sure that no one on benefits is written off. They are radical, long-term plans to help reach our goal of getting a million people off incapacity benefits by 2015.</p> <p>\"While we accept these are difficult economic times, it would be wrong to suggest that disabled people, lone parents and other long-term benefit claimants should simply be put on the scrap-heap.\"</p>",
  "<p>I did not come into Parliament to be a Muslim MP. And I have never set myself up as a Muslim spokesperson or community leader. Just as ordinary citizens have multiple identities, so do MPs.<br> Two months after I was elected we suffered a terrorist attack killing Londoners of all faiths \u2013 and of none \u2013 and of course the three other British Muslim MPs and I were expected by the government, media and the Muslim community to <a href=\"http://www.sadiqkhan.org.uk/blog/archive/2005_08_01_archive.htm\">play our part</a> in the capital's calm and unified response. So, yes, inevitably I have found that I am indeed a Muslim MP and I have those responsibilities.<br> There have been many significant challenges facing British Muslims, and I have a role to play in articulating these and helping come up with solutions. It is the Labour party that has always sought to address the problems facing British Muslims, because we believe it is one of our primary functions to tackle the problems faced by the most vulnerable in our society.  However, we must recognise that the war in Iraq, and its aftermath, have seriously damaged the Labour party's relationship with the Muslim electorate. The Tories are now trying to portray themselves as an \"inclusive party\" reaching out to minority communities by choosing <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6958105.stm\">ethnic minority candidates</a> (in unwinnable seats, I hasten to add). This opportunistic courtship of the Muslim vote is made more remarkable by the fact that the Tories have offered very little in terms of policies which address issues affecting Muslims home or abroad. But this is equally true with the lack of Tory policy ideas in many other areas.<br> For too long, some lazy politicians have engaged leaders of Muslim communities as a shortcut to engaging disenfranchised Muslim citizens. The approach of the Labour party should be to use all forms of making contact. No individual or group can claim to speak for British Muslims. There is a debate going on across British Muslim communities up and down the country and we need to listen and engage with it. Our priority must be to address the major obstacles that prevent many Muslims becoming fully active participants in mainstream civil society, while helping individuals to climb the social ladder and take up new opportunities. Before we can put together a good package of policies, we need a much more sophisticated political narrative on which we can build those policies. A politics of fairness as opposed to favours. Without this, policy measures risk being short-term, vulnerable and divisive.</p> <p>In my pamphlet published by the <a href=\"http://fabians.org.uk/\">Fabian Society</a>, Fairness, not Favours, I lay out a range of specific policies in work, education, language and childcare which build on this new politics and aim to link communities together through the recognition that everyone has a stake in the improvement of the life chances of the worse off. <br> But there are two sides to this. British Muslims also need to step up to the plate. We need to take responsibility for our own lives. We need to take more responsibility for our own families, ignore those who propagate conspiracy theories, and above all we need to leave behind our victim mentality. I challenge British Muslims to accept that as strongly as they feel about Iraq or counter-terrorism measures, poverty and inequality have the biggest impact on the lives of the majority of British Muslims and do the most to prevent potential being fulfilled. Even if your passion is foreign policy, your ability to help people thousands of miles away is made much greater if you are an active citizen and player at home in the UK. Of course, foreign policy is important to British Muslims. Not just because of our ethnic origins, but also because of our interconnectedness with our co-religionists overseas. I argue in my pamphlet that rather than this being a reason to fear us as fifth columnists, it gives UK plc a unique opportunity to tap into our faith and background to improve and enhance the UK business community's global links. Britain's diaspora links can also help reshape often negative perceptions of the UK and can achieve outcomes through engagement with overseas Muslim audiences that would not be possible through formal diplomatic channels. British Muslims will know they have understood the challenges facing them when they realise that childcare should matter more than Kashmir. And they will know the Labour party finally understands them when they hear politicians say that addressing the problems of British Muslims is about fairness, and not favours or fear.</p>",
  "<p>Seeking insider angles on the stockmarket slide, I've been trawling for London-based bankers who blog. I found London Banker, who produced a <a href=\"http://londonbanker.blogspot.com/2008/09/ring-fences-rustlers-and-global-bank.html\">learned post</a> on Lehman Brothers last Friday and hasn't blogged since. Hello from Hackney, London Banker. You OK? His blog's name is inspired by Walter Bagehot's Lombard Street: A Description of the Money Market, in which <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Bagehot\">the author</a> fears for a pillar of society: </p> <blockquote> <p>The name \"London Banker\" had especially a charmed value. He was supposed to represent, and often did represent, a certain union of pecuniary sagacity and educated refinement which was scarcely to be found in any other part of society. In a time when the trading classes were much ruder than they now are, many private bankers possessed variety of knowledge and a delicacy of attainment which would even now be very rare. </p> <p>Such a position is indeed singularly favourable. The calling is hereditary; the credit of the bank descends from father to son: this inherited wealth soon brings inherited refinement. Banking is a watchful, but not a laborious trade. A banker, even in large business, can feel pretty sure that all his transactions are sound, and yet have much spare mind. A certain part of his time, and a considerable part of his thoughts, he can readily devote to other pursuits. And a London banker can also have the most intellectual society in the world if he chooses it. There has probably very rarely ever been so happy a position as that of a London private banker; and never perhaps a happier.</p> </blockquote> <p>These lines were <a href=\"http://www.econlib.org/library/Bagehot/bagLom10.html\">published</a> in 1873. Discuss. </p>",

For those who've never heard of it, it's a bit like the UK but on the other side of the globe and with extra rain. It features the best scenery in the world, and is inhabited by a race of tall, handsome, funny, athletic people with huge IQs, all of whom can cook brilliantly. This comes in useful, as the country features ingredients and methods of cooking that simply don't appear in <em>Larousse Gastromonique</em>.</p> <p>There's the <em>H\u0101ngi</em>, the ancient M\u0101ori procedure where food is buried in the ground and cooked using heated rocks. There's the pavlova, the artery-busting national dish that's perhaps the greatest invention in all the history of eating. Then there's the popular vegetable silverbeet, which is actually the same as chard but has a much sexier name. Much sexier. Perhaps the most Kiwi dish of all, though, is the whitebait fritter. Hell, I can't even say 'whitebait fritter' without slipping back into a New Zealand accent. Go on, you try it. See? Doesn't that sound good?<br><br>The dish is held in such high esteem in New Zealand that when the country's Green Party issued <a href=\"http://new.greens.org.nz/node/19538\">a press release a month ago</a> warning that spawning habitats were being endangered by farming and industrial activity, it was titled, \"Save the Whitebait (fritter)\". The party is obviously aware that for its campaign to succeed, for it to strike fear into the hearts of ordinary Kiwis, it must be targeted firmly at the place where it's most likely to have impact: the stomach. </p> <blockquote> <p>The whitebait tradition is dear to most New Zealanders, as is the delicious whitebait fritter. But this tradition is increasingly more difficult to secure, as we experienced during last year's meagre season</p> </blockquote> <p>Can you imagine the UK Greens issuing a similar statement, one that warns of dwindling supplies and hints at worse to come, but at the same time recognizes that the end result itself is really rather yummy? I can't. They do have a point, though, and it's not just down under where ecological issues should be considered. After all, the whitebait isn't really a species, but a size: the average frozen bag picked up at a UK fishmonger is likely to contain the immature fry of a number of fish, not just sprats and herrings, but sardines, mackerel and more. It's quite possible that future adult stocks will become depleted as a result of all this fish-child genocide, and because the whitebait catch isn't from specifically named species, there's no regulation in place to ensure that this doesn't happen. </p> <p>I must admit, I didn't know any of this until I was researching this piece, and now I feel rather guilty, so I've decided that this will be the last whitebait I ever buy, cook or order. Being from the Land of The Long White Cloud, this is obviously a big deal, much like an Italian refusing to eat truffles or a Frenchman turning his nose up at another bottle of <em>Ch\u00e2teauneuf du Pape</em>.</p> <p><strong>The recipe: serves one</strong></p> <p>125g of whitebait<br>2 eggs<br>1 tbsp butter<br>Salt and pepper to taste </p> <p>1) Whisk the eggs for 20 seconds in a bowl<br>2) Add the whitebait<br>3) Heat the frying pan<br>4) Add the butter<br>5) Add the egg/whitebait mix and cook over a medium heat<br>6) Once the side facing down is a nice golden-brown colour, flip the fritter over and cook until the other side is done.<br>7) Eat with a sprinkling of sea salt, a bottle of Tui East India Pale Ale, while listening to Che Fu's classic 2001 album <em>Navigator</em>. Or perhaps some Chris Knox.</p> <p>And that's it. No more whitebait. But that's not what's worrying me at the moment. </p> <p>Next time, I cook 'x'. There's no animal that begins with 'x'. Help.</p>",

  "<p>Past performance, as they say, is no guarantee of future success. Arsenal fans who remember Manchester United sweeping past Dynamo Kyiv last season, beating them 4-2 in Ukraine and 4-0 at Old Trafford, may be encouraged ahead of tonight's Champions League tie against the Ukrainian runners-up, but they are a very different side this season.</p> <p>Last year was the culmination of a process that has been ongoing since Valeriy Lobanovskyi collapsed in the dug-out at Zaporyzhzhya in 2002. His genius was his ability to evolve, something seen in the way he produced three great sides in three different decades: the Cup-Winners' Cup winners in 1975 and 1986, and the 1999 side that reached the semi-finals of the Champions League. No one who was not acutely responsive to football's changing currents could have generated such sustained success.</p> <p>Since his death, though, subsequent Dynamo coaches \u2013 Oleksiy Mykhailychenko, Jozsef Szabo, Leonid Buryak, Anatoliy Deminanenko and Oleh Luzhny, all of them former Lobanovskyi players \u2013 seemed terrified of deviating from Lobanovskyi's model, as though they were always asking themselves, as Szabo openly admitted, \"What would Valeriy Vasylyovich have done?\"</p> <p>Stasis in football almost always leads to decay, but the model they were reproducing \u2013 the same laboratory Lobanovskyi established for the collation of statistical data and the formation of training programmes still holds sway \u2013 seemed in itself to be declining. According to the Dynamo vice president Serhiy Polkhovskyi, who was a long-time colleague of Lobanovskyi, the great manager struggled towards the end of his life to come to terms not so much with the modern game, but with modern society.</p> <p>He had previously been able to dominate players, but latterly, particularly with the influx of foreign players to Ukraine, the tendency was for them to threaten to leave if asked to fulfil a role in which they did not feel comfortable. The flourishing of the 1999 generation, rooted as it was in players produced by the state-funded academies, was the last hurrah of a bygone era.</p> <p>Besides, given that evolution was built into Lobanovskyi's model, constantly to hark back to a previous age was in itself a betrayal of the model. In their season of three managers, Dynamo lost all six Champions League group games, racking up a goal difference of minus 15, and foundered desperately in the league, making it apparent that radical change was necessary.</p> <p>Eight months ago, they made the controversial appointment of a Russian, Yury Semin, who immediately set about clearing away the old guard and imposing his own vision. Much of it is nothing more than a return to the sort of discipline that underpinned Lobanovskyi's success. \"We put up a list of sanctions over each player's bed,\" explained the club president, Ihor Surkis. \"If you came late, you had to pay. If there was a smell of alcohol on your breath, you had to pay. After that all the problems fell away themselves. No exceptions or appeals. Before we used to make a big drama out of it but now all is very simple.\"</p> <p>Team spirit and self-discipline are the buzz-words. \"After the game the lads gather on the third floor of the stadium and share their impressions from the game,\" Surkis went on. \"If they really want to, they have a glass of beer right in front of the head coach. Nobody goes for the second one though, nor straight to the bars and nightclubs as it used to be before. I believe that the team administration should enforce a strict regimen on the players, that's<br>how it used to be under Lobanovskyi. However now we live in a different country. Now we cannot knock on a footballer's door after 11pm and ask him what is he doing. Nonetheless, the lads have got to have some responsibility themselves for their actions and that is what Mr Semin is working to achieve right now.\"</p> <p>Semin has also brought about significant changes in personnel. The Brazilian centre-back Betao has impressed since his arrival from Corinthians, as has the Croatian midfielder Ognjen Vukojevic, who signed from Dinamo Zagreb. It is the departures, though, that have been the real talking points. \"Mr Semin sent Rincon, Rodrigo and Kleber back to Brazil - and they were once our leading players,\" said Surkis. \"But the team moves on, keeps on notching one success after another. A sporting director from Lyon, Brazilian himself, told me once that two Brazilians in a team is very good, three is a catastrophe and four is a tragedy. That was exactly our situation.\"</p> <p>Betao is the sole Brazilian remaining at Dynamo; Shakhtar Donetsk, with a team packed with Brazilians, have struggled badly this year. So perhaps there is some truth to the theory \u2013 at least in a European environment \u2013 but as much as anything else, the policy is probably as much to do with the widespread backlash against the desire for off-the-shelf exoticism that has so dominated the thinking of the big clubs in the former USSR over the past decade.</p> <p>Semin's success can hardly be disputed. Dynamo improved sufficiently last season to take second in the Ukrainian domestic league and to secure qualification for the Champions League. They currently lie second again, having won five of seven games this season. More tellingly, they also beat Spartak Moscow 4-1 home and away in the third qualifying round, with Ishmael Bangoura, the Guinean striker, and the young Ukrainian Artem Milevskyi demonstrating a fearsome understanding.</p> <p>Arsenal have lost on their only two previous trips to Kyiv, but this time they will not have to face the frenzied claxons of the Olympyskyi. The national stadium is undergoing renovation work ahead of Euro 2012, so Dynamo will play at their own ground, the Valeriy Lobanovskyi Stadium. It is much smaller and shallower than the Olympyskyi, but it may be that Dynamo feel more comfortable there \u2013 as Arsenal themselves did on returning to Highbury after the experiment of playing Champions League games at Wembley. Certainly with its statue of Lobanovskyi and the memorial to the four players killed in the aftermath of the Death Match of 1943, when a Dynamo side beat the Luftwaffe, it has a more partisan feel.</p> <p>How much of a factor that will prove is impossible to say, but Luzhny, now working as Semin's assistant, is adamant that Dynamo can win. What is sure is that they will not be the accommodating patsies they were last year. As Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has suggested, a draw might be a very good result for Arsenal.</p>",

  "<p>The airports operator BAA today announced its intention to sell Gatwick.</p> <p>The company, which also owns Heathrow, Stansted and Scotland's three biggest airports, said it was beginning the sale process \"immediately\" and that customers, staff and business would benefit.</p> <p>A report from the Competition Commission last month identified \"significant competition problems\" because of BAA's dominant position and called for the company to give up two of its three London airports.</p> <p>Gatwick, near Crawley in West Sussex, is the UK's second-busiest airport after Heathrow. It was used by 35 million passengers last year.</p> <p>Analysts have estimated it could fetch between \u00a32bn and \u00a33bn. </p> <p>The BAA chief executive, Colin Matthews, said: \"Gatwick has long been an important and valuable part of BAA and the decision to sell was not taken lightly.</p> <p>\"We believe that the airport's customers, staff and business will benefit from the earliest possible resolution of current uncertainty.</p> <p>\"When the Competition Commission published its provisional findings, we said that we would be realistic in our response, though we disagree with the commission's report and the analysis on which it is founded.\"</p> <p>He said the group wanted to continue to operate its three other south-east airports - including Southampton - and its three Scottish hubs. This could fall foul of the Commission's eventual recommendations.</p> <p>In provisional findings issued last month after a long-running inquiry into BAA's position, the commission said it was likely to order BAA to sell Gatwick and Stansted and either Glasgow or Edinburgh airport.</p> <p>Matthews said: \"We will continue to present our case, in respect of the south-east airports and those in Scotland. At Stansted we believe that a change of ownership would interfere with the process of securing planning approval for a second runway, which remains a key feature of government air transport policy.</p> <p>\"BAA will continue to change in many respects. We have a new management team. Our priority is to improve the quality of service we offer passengers and airlines.\"</p> <p>BAA has been owned by the Spanish company Ferrovial since 2006.</p> <p>Steve Turner, national officer of the Unite trade union, which represents airport workers, said Gatwick should not be sold. \"At a time when the sector is being battered by the credit crunch, faces tough challenges in soaring fuel prices and new security measures, aviation needs stability, not the fire sale of a profitable, significant airport.\"</p> <p>Turner urged BAA to reconsider its decision and argue the case for retaining ownership. The government could not \"sit on the sidelines\" while airports were destabilised, he said.</p> <p>Sir Richard Branson's airline Virgin Atlantic immediately threw its hat into the ring, saying it would be happy to join a bidding consortium. Its chief executive, Steve Ridgway, said: \"We are delighted that BAA has ended the uncertainty over Gatwick's future.</p> <p>\"Virgin Atlantic would relish the opportunity to bid for Gatwick as part of a consortium and inject our customer service expertise into any future running of the airport.</p> <p>\"But Gatwick doesn't just need a new owner - it needs a much tougher regulatory system which ensures any new owner doesn't simply become BAA mark 2.\"</p> <p>Other international firms had already expressed interest in Gatwick airport as owner BAA faced being broken up by competition bosses. Germany's Hochtief, Global Infrastructure Partners, the GE-Credit Suisse Investment fund and Australia's Macquarie group are all said to have indicated their interest to the BAA chairman, Sir Nigel Rudd.</p> <p>Other bidders could emerge from the US and Asia.</p> <p>Gatwick is the busiest single-runway airport in the world, hosting 80 airlines and managing 262,000 air transport movements per year.

  "<p>The US government has seized control of the world's biggest <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/insurance\">insurance company</a>, AIG, in an $85bn (\u00a347bn) emergency rescue to avert a \"disorderly\" bankruptcy which threatened to wreak havoc with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/wallstreet\">fragile financial markets</a>.</p> <p>After a marathon day of negotiations in New York, the Federal Reserve reluctantly agreed to lend taxpayers' money on a two-year basis in return for a 79.9% stake in AIG.</p> <p>The highly unusual decision effectively nationalises AIG by transferring control to the central bank. In a sign of the level of alarm about the weakening financial system, the Bush administration set aside its usual orthodoxy of avoiding intervention in the free market.</p> <p>In a statement released late last night, the Fed said it had concluded that a \"disorderly failure\" of AIG could \"add to already significant levels of financial market fragility and lead to substantially higher borrowing costs, reduced household wealth and materially weaker economic performance\".</p> <p>AIG employs 106,000 people in 130 countries and sells 12m policies annually in Britain - including travel insurance and product protection under retailers' own brands such as Boots, Argos, Comet and Sainsbury's. It is shirt sponsor to Manchester United football club.</p> <p>The treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, insisted that AIG's chief executive, Robert Willumstad, stepped down as a condition of the deal. He is to be replaced by Edward Liddy, a former boss of the insurance firm Allstate. AIG's board approved the rescue package at a late-night meeting.</p> <p>Crippled by losses on policies insuring investors against default on exotic financial products, the firm had less than 48 hours to find sufficient cash to meet a rash of contractual obligations. It has been teetering on the brink of following <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/interactive/2008/sep/15/lehmans\">Lehman Brothers</a> into bankruptcy - a scenario which horrified financial experts who said the reverberations would be felt by policyholders, trading partners and investors around the globe.</p> <p>President Bush was quick to lend his backing to the bailout. \"The President supports the agreement announced this evening by the Federal Reserve,\" said a White House spokesman, Tony Fratto. \"These steps are taken in the interest of promoting stability in financial markets and limiting damage to the broader economy.\"</p> <p>The rescue comes a week after a decision to rescue two enormous mortgage companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. But there are likely to be questions about inconsistency in policy since no government aid was forthcoming to support Lehman Brothers when the Wall Street bank collapsed on Monday.</p> <p>The Democratic chairman of the Senate banking committee, Christopher Dodd, asked: \"Tell me why this situation deserves that kind of infusion of support, whereas Lehman Brothers did not.\"</p> <p>The treasury secretary travelled to Washington last night to brief Congressional leaders. Leading Democrats lent their support, although they suggested that laissez-faire government policies had contributed to AIG's predicament.</p> <p>Barney Frank, the influential chairman of the House financial services committee, told the New York Times: \"This is one more affirmation that the lack of regulation has caused serious problems. That the private market screwed itself up and they need the government to come help them unscrew it.\"</p> <p>The Fed, which engaged Morgan Stanley for advice, had shopped around unsuccessfully for a private-sector solution to AIG's problems. Leading banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley rebuffed appeals to provide funds, as did the world's richest man, Warren Buffett.</p> <p>As rumours of a bailout leaked onto trading floors on Tuesday afternoon, a mood of relief swept the market and the Dow Jones industrial average closed up 141 points to 11,059 - clawing back some of the losses made on Monday when the market suffered its sharpest fall since September 2001. The Australian stockmarket, among the few global exchanges to be open when the bailout was confirmed, rose by 1.2%.</p> <p>The terms of the bailout give sweeping powers to the Fed. The $85bn loan is collateralised by all of AIG's assets and the Fed can veto dividend payouts to the insurer's shareholders. AIG's shares, which had already collapsed by 93% since the beginning of the year, will be left with little value.</p> <p>Experts said the interconnected nature of financial institutions was becoming increasingly clear - and was causing mounting alarm at the prospect of a major bankruptcy.</p> <p>\"It might not just bring down other financial institutions in the US. It could bring down overseas financial institutions,\" said Timothy Canova, a professor of international economic law at Chapman University School of Law. \"If Lehman Brother's failure could help trigger AIG's going down, who knows who AIG's failure could trigger next.\"</p>",

The businesses will be merged into Barclays Capital, although it is not clear whether the Lehman name, one of the oldest on Wall Street, will disappear in the short term.</p> <p>Barclays is paying $250m in cash and taking on $72bn in trading assets and $68bn in trading liabilities. They include mortgage assets, equities, corporate debts, government bonds and commercial paper.</p> <p>In addition, Barclays is paying $1.5bn for the Lehman headquarters, a glass and steel tower just north of Times Square in New York, as well as two data centres in New Jersey. The bank said the price represented the buildings' market values.</p> <p>The agreement is being supported by certain \"strategic\" investors in the bank, who have agreed to subscribe to at least $1bn of new equity. Barclays did not name which investors would be supporting the deal, but among its strategic investors are the Qatar Investment Auhtority, China Development Bank and Singapore's Temasek.</p> <p>Barclays issued a trading statement alongside the deal describing business in July and August as \"satisfactory\". All parts of the business were profitable, it added.</p> <p>While lawyers had still been finalising details of the agreement yesterday afternoon, Diamond, was already acting as though the deal was done. He had addressed staff at Lehman in New York yesterday afternoon, telling them: \"You have a new partner.\"</p> <p>Barclays said the deal does not include the toxic property related investments that proved Lehman's downfall.</p> <p>Neither, for now at least, does the agreement include Lehman's business in London, which was put into administration on Monday, although Barclays would not rule out the possibility when the current deal is done.</p> <p>Lehman was racing to sell off the investment bank before staff and clients began to leave in large numbers, eroding any residual value it might have. Staff have been clearing their desks and walking out with bags or cardboard boxes full of possessions since it became apparent on Sunday evening that the firm was finished.</p> <p>A deadline for completing the deal to buy the North American business has been set for September 24.</p> <p>Barclays had confirmed yesterday that it was back at the negotiating table. The news came less than 48 hours after it had walked away from talks orchestrated by US officials to prevent Lehman falling into bankruptcy.</p> <p>The failure of Lehman, the fourth-largest investment bank on Wall Street, together with the sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America, triggered a worldwide sell-off in the financial markets and shook faith in Wall Street.</p> <p>Lehman renewed contact with Barclays on Monday afternoon to see if it would still be interested in some of its assets. Diamond, who led the failed weekend negotiations to take control of Lehman, had remained in the US and worked through the night to hammer out an agreement.</p> <p>One banker who works in the Canary Wharf offices of Lehman said the Barclays deal had gotten a mixed reaction in London. \"We're pleased for our colleagues but it makes people in London feel even more hung out to dry, particularly since they use this corporate slogan of having a 'one firm' culture,\" he said.</p> <p>Lehman Brothers is filing an emergency motion with the Bankruptcy Court seeking a hearing to obtain approval for the acquisition.</p> <p>The bank filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which provides protection from creditors while it liquidates its business. The operations in the UK were put into administration and staff reacted with shock and anger as they turned up for work on Monday and were in most cases told to go back home again.</p> <p>Frustration was clearly evident yesterday. Staff had been given a two-page Q&amp;A sheet, but one banker said it contained considerably more questions than answers. \"Senior management has been noticeable by a complete absence of information,\" he said.</p> <p>The atmosphere in the office, he added, was \"very informal, there's only a smattering of people around there at any time just hanging around, using the email or using the phones.\"</p> <p>Barclays has grown its investment banking division rapidly under Diamond's 10-years at the top. He was involved in disbanding the bank's last disastrous foray into global financial markets, BZW, and there have been some concerns that the bank might repeat past mistakes.</p> <p>John Varley, the Barclays chief executive said the deal \"accelerates the execution of our strategy of diversification by geography and business in pursuit of profitable growth.\"</p> <p>Barclays said the deal would give it a top three position in the US capital markets. The firm said it would also extend Barclays Capital's range of investment banking products, with the addition of Lehman Brothers strong US M&amp;A and equity capital markets franchises.</p> <p>The deal will result in a significant lift to the amount of earnings from the US. \"We will now have the best team and most productive culture across the world's major financial markets, backed by the resources of an integrated universal bank,\" Diamond said.</p> <p>Lehman listed assets of $639bn, making it the biggest bankruptcy filing ever, 10 times the size of the energy firm Enron when it went bust in late 2001.</p> <p>Frustration at Lehman in New York had been growing yesterday, particularly over its chief executive, Richard Fuld, who had still to address workers directly. \"We don't know what is going on,\" one Lehman banker said outside the firm's offices in midtown Manhattan. \"Fuld hasn't said anything to us yet; we're all uncertain whether we have got jobs or not.\"</p> <p>Figures out yesterday showed hedge funds and other investors that had been shorting Lehman's stock since March had made $29bn from the firm's demise.</p>",

The unravelling of the business is expected to take months or possibly years.</p> <p>One large asset owned by Lehman is its corporate headquarters on Seventh Avenue in New York, which the bank paid $650m for after it was forced out of downtown New York by the attacks of September 11 2001.</p> <p>Fears began to grow for Lehman in March, after the near failure of Bear Stearns. But the business rapidly imploded just a week ago when it became clear that talks to secure capital from the Korea Development Bank had broken down.</p>"
