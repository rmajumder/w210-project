  "<p>The bad press the oil industry receives could mean it's overlooked by students narrowing down career options, but companies have been cleaning up their act, and with high oil prices there has perhaps never been a better time to explore the options. For those with engineering and science backgrounds, the industry provides a wealth of opportunities, and a wealth of cash. Petroleum engineers working in larger companies, for example, can command starting salaries of \u00a329,000, and could see their earnings top \u00a390,000 during their careers. Add to that the opportunities to travel and were not just talking trips out to the North Sea and a career in the oil industry could be a gas.</p> <h2>An employer says</h2> <p><strong>Mike Wagstaff, chief executive Venture Production plc</strong></p> <p>(<a href=\"http://www.venture-production.com\">venture-production.com</a>)</p> <p>We take on graduates for subsurface positions: geologists, petroleum geoscientists, reservoir engineers the people who tell us how much oil and gas is underground, where it is and how best to get it out.</p> <p>We recruit graduates with at least a masters, and I think it's pretty much the same across the industry. I studied mechanical engineering and it was hard to get into the oil industry with just an undergraduate degree. I had to get a masters, but there are plenty of companies that offer sponsorship to do it. They are largely vocational courses, designed to get you into the industry.</p> <p>Most of our graduates are based in the office, but will go out to meet people offshore. The great thing about the industry is it can be incredibly technical and theoretical, but it has to be grounded in practice because we have to get the oil and gas out of the ground.</p> <p>The oil and gas industry has not got a great reputation; it's seen as nasty, dirty and polluting, but its still pretty fundamental. We need it to turn the lights on, to turn the heating on and to drive our cars. As consumers, we never see or touch the product we produce. The only gas we see is when its burning in the cooker; we don't see petrol. The product is sold into a commodity market where the price is set by whats going on in the world. It doesnt have the same touch point with customers, so the industry tends to be a bit more internally focused. We dont do enough to promote what we do.</p> <h2>A university says</h2> <p><strong>Quentin Fisher, professor of petroleum geoengineering, Centre for Integrated Petroleum Engineering and Geoscience, School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds</strong> (<a href=\"http://leeds.ac.uk\">leeds.ac.uk</a>)</p> <p>Our BEng in petroleum engineering is designed to provide undergraduates with core skills in the process engineering, geology and geophysics disciplines as well as more specialised topics in petroleum extraction and refining. Overall, we hope to provide students with a diverse education that will enable them to work effectively within the multidisciplinary teams that they are likely to join within the oil industry.</p> <p>Petroleum engineers can have a very diverse background. For example, it is extremely common to meet engineers whose first degree, MSc or PhD is in subjects such as mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, physics, astrophysics, or maths. Most people working in the industry will have a masters or PhD, and will undergo extensive training when they first join.</p> <p>There is a huge demand for petroleum engineering staff within the oil industry, and the overall trend in oil prices is likely to be upwards for the foreseeable future. Oil has become a high-value resource, where, increasingly, specialist solutions are needed in both extraction and processing. We believe that the jobs market for petroleum engineers will remain buoyant for many years to come.</p> <p>Career prospects in the field of petroleum engineering are excellent and well-qualified engineers can command high salaries soon after graduating. However, long-term career prospects would definitely benefit by undertaking a higher degree before entering the petroleum industry.</p> <h2>A graduate says</h2> <p><strong>Poonum Parmar, reservoir engineer, Shell </strong>(<a href=\"http://shell.co.uk\">shell.co.uk</a>)</p> <p>I work in the Aberdeen office and my role is to find out if we are using the oil fields to their full potential. I'm looking at what opportunities exist and how we can optimise them in the best possible way to get the maximum value out of the fields.</p> <p>I've visited a rig in the North Sea, which was fantastic. You're out at sea and you suddenly see this big lump of metal, which was overwhelming.</p> <p>I graduated in chemical engineering, which is slightly different from the degree you really need for reservoir engineering, but the training you get here pretty much puts you in good stead.</p> <p>At university I was given the opportunity to go to Bosnia for charity, a project Shell sponsored, so I developed a relationship with the company. I became their campus representative and did an internship, so my interest in the oil industry was progressive.</p> <p>When my graduate scheme finishes, I want to work overseas. I'd like to go to Canada or Asia. I'd like to get more offshore experience, have a go at the dirty stuff.</p>",

  "<p>In the space of a few moments Joe Kinnear went from being a bizarre choice as caretaker manager of Newcastle United to looking the ideal candidate. A microphone had no sooner been put before him than he showed an aptitude for mayhem that will suit him perfectly to the endless turmoil of Tyneside. Others simply endure the maelstrom but Kinnear ramped up the volatility. Where else would a temporary employee announce an imminent takeover and then declare that Kevin Keegan, possibly accompanied by Alan Shearer, would be in charge under the new regime?</p> <p>No journalist can deplore indiscretions with a straight face and it must be conceded that newspapers are now in Kinnear's debt. However, his selection was a shock because, if anything, it compounded the sense of risk at Newcastle. There must be a few overseas newcomers on the books who have never heard of him and who will be dumbfounded when they realise that his last stint in management was with Nottingham Forest in 2004.</p> <p>If the owner, Mike Ashley, instructed Kinnear to put information about Keegan and Shearer into the public domain, it is a perplexing strategy. Indeed, there was general bafflement about such declarations, with associates of Shearer not only nonplussed but convinced that he would refuse to be part of such a structure. And the prospective purchasers of Newcastle, who may be a Nigerian consortium, cannot be on the verge of completing the formalities if we must wait until the end of next month before they are installed.</p> <p>At least there was a thread of logic to be followed in the advent of Kinnear. The inevitable reasoning is that he arrives because of his past association at Wimbledon with Dennis Wise, Newcastle's executive director (football). None the less, their alliance at St James' Park must necessarily be brief if Keegan is on his way back. The reappointment of the manager cannot be feasible without the removal of Wise. That, however, begs the question of how the club are to be organised in the long term.</p> <p>Wise, in effect, has been director of football and although such figures are often reviled they are essential now that players are acquired from all parts of the globe. He and Tony Jimenez, the vice-president (player recruitment) at Newcastle, have made useful additions to the squad. Although it was intolerable to Keegan that efforts were reportedly being made to offload people he wanted to retain, the running of clubs can never be simple again. Unless Keegan could acquire a deep knowledge of the global game while also running the first team, he would have to find a way of operating in partnership with others, even if Wise and Jimenez were banished. Ashley, indeed, was culpable in neglecting to hammer out an understanding of how the three individuals would function together.</p> <p>The mooted reinstatement of Keegan, widely anticipated as it has been by bookmakers, will also revive reservations about him. He is a stimulating character and the doubts are really about whether, at heart, he still has a yearning to be a manager. He left Manchester City in the summer of 2005 after explaining that he wanted to retire from professional football. That fatigue did not seem feigned. He was preoccupied thereafter with his Soccer Circus business. Some, indeed, made the link between a return to St James' Park, on a salary put at \u00a33m, and the losses his company had been making. </p> <p>By his own admission, Keegan had not attended a Premier League match since the parting with City. His attachment to Newcastle is real but that in itself did not mean that he would have the drive, day by day, to lead the club. Nor did it show that he was up to date with all the developments in a fast-changing sport.</p> <p>Ashley's populist donning of that replica Keegan jersey might actually have disheartened sceptical elements in the crowd. Newcastle have to do far more than tap into Tyneside nostalgia. In truth it is natural for these fans to respond to emotional appeals. Lacking a major honour since the 1955 FA Cup, the spectators are bound to dream of some transformative power. Indeed, the same phenomenon would develop at any prominent club with passionate followers that had encountered nothing but disappointment for two generations. </p> <p>None the less, it was Ashley's duty to stick to a long-term, reasoned policy. Summoning Keegan was a theatrical coup. The St James' Park crowd deserves far more than an appeal to its emotions, limitless as those appear to be.</p>",
  "<p>In the afterglow of Arsenal's 6-0 Carling Cup duffing-up of Sheffield United, the general feeling seems to be that this week has given us a tantalising glimpse of the future. Golden generations have been mentioned. Mob-handed, high-fiving, all-conquering futures have been sketched out. And once again the talk is of the giddy new dawn of a master race of bright-eyed young Gunners. </p> <p>In fact, such has been the response that some have already predicted an entire decade dominated by people predicting an entire decade dominated by Arsenal's crop of elastic-limbed scamps. A fresh epoch of talking about fresh epochs is here. A generational shift of going on about generational shifts has arrived. We're in a bright new era era. </p> <p>On the other hand, there is always a chance you might have had enough of honeyed youth and wild, untamed, beardless joie de vivre. The bold new dawn of talking about Arsenal's bold new dawn might already be getting a bit much. If so, have faith. We can beat this thing. It's a question of tactics. <br><strong><br>Get physical </strong></p> <p>First principles. See how much they want it. The man in front of you might be prepared to talk until closing time about how Jack Wilshere's three-year-old brother can already do nine million round-the-world keep-ups. But does he like it up him? Let him know you're about. Leave a leg in. Jab him violently in the ribs as he draws breath for another peon to high-speed pass-and-move. He wants to turn up and talk about nice, clever, pretty football. Make him earn the right. <br><strong><br>Don't let them settle</strong></p> <p>One thing this week's spectacular display of talking about this week's spectacular display has taught us is that if you give these people time and space they will murder you. So don't let them get into their stride. Feign a fit of coughing at the first mention of a multi-million-pound global nursery of talent. Embark on a 10-minute monologue about the difference between a chutney and a pickle. Spoil. Waste time. Just don't let them express themselves.<br><strong><br>Fight fire with fire</strong></p> <p>Already worn down by endless talk of the Mexican one, the English one who's actually quite good and the one whose Facebook page contains 1,323 partially dressed friends all called Mitzi or Linzi? Fight back in kind. Talk at great length about your own favourite crop of era-defining youth: East Coast beat poets of the 1950s; Gripper Stebson's gang of toughs in Grange Hill; the Woodcraft Folk; teenagers with quiffs dancing to skiffle on Ready, Steady, Go! Anyone, really. Just get in there first.<br><strong><br>They won't fancy it in February</strong></p> <p>The old leveller. It's all very well talking about the new dawn of a fresh tomorrow while consuming a goji-bean smoothie in an independent north London coffee shop on a mild September evening. It's a different matter maintaining the same level of querulous piety while consuming a goji-bean smoothie in an independent north London coffee shop on a chilly afternoon after Christmas. It's the ski season. The new Harry Potter's out. Whatever.</p> <p><strong>Sit it out</strong></p> <p>One thing about exciting new dawns of talking about exciting new dawns: they have to come to an end. A quarter-final mugging by a pumped-up crew of Premier League old lags. The mass shipping-out on loan to Cardiff. Even perhaps an iffy 10 minutes against Hull this afternoon. In fact, rumour has it there's already some talk about talking about the end of the brave new era of talking about Arsenal's brave new era. But, of course, it might all be just talk.</p>",
  "<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338021513\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2008/09/26/Untitled-1.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Ford\" width=\"220\" height=\"310\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph by Vittorio Zunino Celotto, Getty\t</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vittorio Zunino Celotto /Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How long should you wait before asking if someone's had Botox? This was just one of several questions that crossed my mind when menswear designer Tom Ford, 47, very handsome if suspiciously unlined of face, arrived for lunch in Beverly Hills on a bright Monday afternoon. (Other mental queries included, were those glinting chest hairs, visible thanks to the almost half-unbuttoned shirt, specially oiled for this occasion?) It felt a little intrusive to ask a man about his medical procedures before he'd even had his iced tea. So I waited until he finished his drink.</p> <p>\"I haven't had any plastic surgery - despite what people think, this is my nose,\" Ford replied, as smooth as his face. \"I have had Restylane and Botox, but I don't think of that as plastic surgery any more. It's true I can't really frown, but I can move my eyebrows, so...\" </p> <p>As well as designing and expanding his eponymous menswear line and getting ready for his first foray into film directing, Ford has been busy this year designing suits for Daniel Craig in the soon-to-be-released James Bond film Quantum Of Solace. But all this multitasking has not muted the man. During the 90s, when Ford rescued Gucci - shepherding it from near bankruptcy when he arrived in 1994 to fashion monolith status, with annual sales of more than $3bn, when he left 10 years later - he was credited with, as one fashion critic put it, \"bringing sex back\". His overtly sexy clothes - LBDs and tight trousers for all aspiring Linda Fiorentinos - brought blatant, confident sexuality back after an era dominated by grunge. </p> <p>Ford, who has been with his partner, former fashion editor Richard Buckley, for 23 years, revelled in his role as the King of Sex, obliging journalists with deliberately provocative comments and commissioning an infamous ad that featured a model's pubic hair shaved into the Gucci logo. </p> <p>A decade on, he has moved away from the high-octane glamour he brought to Gucci and later Yves Saint Laurent (for four years he designed for both, making him arguably the most powerful designer in the world). Instead, his own menswear line, which he started in 2006, is classic and more mature. He has rejected the fashion merry-go-round and trend-chasing that may have left him briefly \"burned out\" but also made him very wealthy (when he left Gucci and YSL in 2004 he allegedly had \u00a390m). If a man wants to know how it feels to wear, and buy, couture, he can now go to Tom Ford: this is a label where five-figure price tags are the norm. Yet Ford is a far cry from a traditional Savile Row tailor. He has multiple homes in multiple countries; he hangs out with \"lots of actors you'd have heard of\", and he is still happy talking about sex, even if he does claim he is \"much less overt than I was\". \"Honestly,\" he insists at one point, \"I never set out to make anything sexy.\" At this point he had to apologise for eyeing me up - \"Sorry, I keep looking at your body because I like how people's bodies look\".</p> <p>If ever there were a designer made to make suits for James Bond, it is surely Ford. Hell, the man even looks like Bond. He first met Daniel Craig through artist Sam Taylor-Wood, \"who's a good friend\" (this phrase comes up a lot), \"at a party\" (as does this). Craig then asked him to make his suits for Quantum Of Solace. \"A lot of people think if you wear classic clothes you're dull. Bond dresses that way, but he does not lead a dull life - not sexually and not in his career,\" Ford says, with delightful understatement. \"And with Daniel, you have someone who looks classic but leads a very exciting life.\"</p> <p>Ford has been described as \"the straightest gay man in the world\". Maybe this refers to his fondness for making appreciative remarks about women's bodies. Maybe it's a faintly homophobic comment about his tough business mind, as though a gay man couldn't possibly do spreadsheets. In any event, if he seems straight, then Graham Norton is Arnold Schwarzenegger. Think Cary Grant in Studio 54 and you have some measure of the man.</p> <p>But this overlooks his corporate nous. At Gucci, Ford wasn't just the label's creative director, he was also the company's vice-chairman. In between designing the multiple collections each year, he contended with shareholders and corporate affairs. Under him, the company invested cannily in young designers, including Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re at Balenciaga, Stella McCartney and Alexander McQueen. Though Ford insists he takes \"absolutely no credit\" for the success those three have had since, Ghesqui\u00e8re nearly welled up when I asked about Ford and said the designer \"taught me everything\". Ford also bought the then waning Yves Saint Laurent and installed himself as the label's designer, with similar success.</p> <p>He is, he says, \"innately a fashion designer\", but the business side clearly interests him at least as much as the clothes. He enthusiastically discusses the new global markets (\"The next century belongs to China, Russia, Brazil and India\") and flits easily between fashion fabulousness (\"Menswear in France does not exist. What do they have? Pink socks? Please\") and business speak about networks and brand identity.</p> <p>Ford was born in Texas, and grew up in New Mexico and Houston. The son of two realtors, he was a self-described \"spoiled child\" who went to New York to study art history. He quickly switched to theatrical studies to fulfil his ambition of becoming an actor. He became so successful in commercials - at one point starring in 12 at the same time - that he dropped out of college. \"I'm not going to tell you which ones, because I don't want you to look them up,\" he says, but then proceeds to re-enact them, showing the moves one makes when advertising anti-acne cream, shampoo and, to the bemusement of our fellow diners, deodorant. But he soon realised he would never be happy as an actor, mainly because he resented being told what to do. \"I did not like having to read a line the way a director told me to when I thought it was stupid. Or not being able to rewrite the line myself.\" </p> <p>While he was a student, he fell in with Andy Warhol's gang (\"It was very easy to meet Andy and get into Studio 54 if you were a cute 17-year-old boy\") and it was then he realised he was gay. He'd had girlfriends in high school, \"and was very satisfied, but then it was suddenly like, oh!\" he says with an easy shrug. He returned to school and got a degree in architecture, but realised he wanted to focus on fashion and slowly worked his way up the ladder. When he was named creative director of Gucci in 1994, few had heard of him.</p> <p>Ford credits the instant appeal of the sexed-up Amazonian look he brought to Gucci as it \"simply coming at the right time. Fashion in the early 90s was very depressing, after the stock market crash in the 80s, then Aids ravaging the industry. It was time for a change.\" It's hard not to wonder if his embrace of the image was something of a pose. Ford nearly spits out his salad in shock at the suggestion, although he soon relents: \"In the mid-90s, when advertising was less overtly sexual, maybe I did it to provoke a little. But there had to be a message. When I shaved the G in the girl's pubic hair, that was a comment on the ridiculous lengths we'd gone to with branding.\" It's a fair point, but considering Ford was at the forefront of so-called logomania - peaking with the \u00a3505 monogrammed Gucci yoga mat - the words \"cake\", \"having\" and \"eating\" come to mind.</p> <p>In 2004, Ford was unexpectedly forced out of the Gucci Group after negotiations broke down about his contract with Pinault-Printemps-Redoute, which owns 70% of Gucci. Although he puts an all-for-the-best spin on it now, he was stunned at the time and had \"something like a midlife crisis. While I realised I had an identity without Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent, my life and work had become so meshed. I'm always trying to make things better, make myself better, and I had a sudden panic of, well, who am I?\" Ford took three months off, quickly realised he hated not working and returned to plan his own label.</p> <p>Part of the problem was that Ford had so embodied his brands: he was frequently photographed at parties wearing Gucci and played the sexual provocateur role. \"I actually hate being in the spotlight, but no one ever believes me,\" he insists, the latter part of that statement at least being true. When Ford edited an issue of Vanity Fair in 2006, he was on the cover, nuzzling a naked Scarlett Johansson and Keira Knightley. \"Honestly, I was not supposed to be on the cover.\" He sighs. \"That picture was taken when I was showing Rachel McAdams [an actor who left the shoot because she felt \"uncomfortable about being naked\"] what to do. But, of course, I liked the picture...\"</p> <p>For someone who \"hate[s] promoting things with my face\", he must be unhappy much of the time. Adverts for his cologne feature Ford staring straight at the camera. \"I understand that I have a certain look that can be used to my advantage. I know the power of that when I walk into a room and talk to people, and I can use it as an advertising tool. Now I am actually selling me, my face, my thoughts. So I am my guy,\" he says.</p> <p>When he launched his label in 2006, it looked like self-indulgent folly to some. Why would someone with such a talent for giving mass appeal to luxury lines run into the narrow niche of, to use Ford's favourite word, exclusivity? Now, however, when most designers are worrying about the economic downturn, Ford's business model looks downright prescient. It's not that he believes the nonsense touted in many fashion magazines that the best form of economising is to buy expensive things because they are \"investments\". Instead, it's that the customers Ford has targeted are people who won't be affected by a recession or, if they are,\"they're buying fewer Warhols but still buying suits\". Currently there are stores only in New York and Milan, but by this time next year there will be 16 more. </p> <p>If Ford defined a new image of women in the 90s, what does the success of his label, with its $17,000 jackets and $4,000 blazers, say about 21st-century men? Well, it certainly says something economically. As Ford puts it, \"Because of the increase of wealth in this world, it is possible to have a new business model where you can reach a very healthy scale of business catering only to a smaller percentage of people - people with, let's be real, a lot of money.\"</p> <p>Ford admits the one thing he missed when he left Gucci was \"not having a voice in popular culture\". Surely, by making his brand so expensive, his influence is somewhat limited? He argues that it's not necessarily the clothes themselves that reflect culture, but the whole concept of the brand. \"I think people are sick of trends changing every six months - not because we're tired of them, but just for the sake of change. There is so much junk in the world: junk TV, junk movies, all those junk magazines with the same people on the cover. Our clothes are about quality and making the man's body look good, which is not something that a lot of menswear designers think about any more.\"</p> <p>Ford, a vocal Obama supporter, ties this proliferation of junk and dumbed-down culture to the current state of US politics: \"We've been in a downward spiral of culture in America for a while. So we've created an ignorance, and I'm just hoping there are more people who [will vote in the US election who] are enlightened than not. I don't mean it to sound arrogant that I call it enlightened: it's just an awareness of the outside world and of the true meaning of religion and not the meaning that has been pushed by the religious right, which is really twisted,\" he says. When Bush invaded Iraq, Ford told a journalist he was \"ashamed to be an American\", a comment that got him a lot of flak but of which he is \"still very proud... I genuinely believe that with Obama we have a chance to undo some of the terrible damage we did under the Bush administration. America is in the position that Britain was a century ago: we will no longer be the economic leader in the world but, with Obama, we can become the moral leader again.\"</p> <p>Does he worry about McCain and Palin's anti-gay rights stance? \"It's more the mind-set that worries me: anyone who is anti-gay rights shows an intolerance of other humans and their needs, so what worries me more is how that mind-set would filter into other issues.\"</p> <p>Ford and Buckley have been in a happy, stable relationship for almost a quarter of a century, \"and it's been a very nice life\". They are not planning to marry, simply because, Ford says, suddenly becoming very passionate, gay marriage is still not recognised by the US government. \"Even though the California government recognises it, if I died tomorrow my estate would be taxed as if I were single by the federal government. That is not right! Until that changes, gay marriage is just a symbol.\"</p> <p>Before meeting Ford in LA, I went to his store in New York. \"Obsessively detailed\" doesn't begin to describe this giant luxurious uptown temple. Put it this way: there is a man who just looks after the bonsai trees. \"Absolutely. Each tree goes to the countryside every seven days for a month to get some sun,\" Ford says proudly. But the store was packed. Yes, some were window-shoppers, but there was one man ordering his winter wardrobe and another getting a $7,500 suit. The obsessive detail and bonsai trees seem to be working. \"I probably do have an obsessive personality, but striving for perfection has served me well,\" Ford says.</p> <p>It is an attitude he also applies to himself. Ford, who once said he has been on a diet since he was 13, spends \"a lot of time looking after myself\". He plays tennis at least three times a week; he does Pilates twice a week; he hikes; he swims; he rides horses on his ranch in Santa Fe; he skis; he watches what he eats and he tries not to drink too much, despite \"loving it\". </p> <p>When we leave, he, ever the gentleman, insists I walk in front and we march out together, him complimenting me on my outfit. It's only when we get to the door and I turn to say goodbye that I see he has put on his sunglasses specifically for the walk past all the gawking fellow customers and assumed the stern \"I'm a celebrity, don't look at me but actually please do\" expression familiar from photos of him on the red carpet. When one is selling a perfect image of oneself, there is no time off.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown last night threw his weight behind the $700bn bail-out after receiving assurances from George Bush that the plan was big enough to calm the turmoil on Wall Street and will be passed by the US Congress.</p> <p>The prime minister made his remarks after he emerged from talks with the president at the White House last night. Bush said he told Brown that the plan still being thrashed out by congressional leaders was \"big enough to make a difference, and it is going to be passed\".</p> <p>Brown responded: \"Britain supports the plan. Whatever the details, it is the right thing to do to take us through these circumstances. America deserves the support of the rest of the world.\" He also sought to persuade Bush to swing behind a medium-term plan to set up more effective forms of international regulation capable of matching the global flow of funds.</p> <p>Brown is starting to come under pressure from some European heads of state for siding with the US against tighter international regulation, but he insists such criticisms do not take account of his repeated calls to strengthen the supervisory role of the International Monetary Fund.</p> <p>Earlier yesterday, he told the UN general assembly that the age of irresponsibility had to be brought to an end, a phrase seized on by the Conservatives last night. \"This has been an age of global prosperity,\" he said. \"It's also been an era of global turbulence, and where there has been irresponsibility we must now clearly say the age of irresponsibility must be ended.\" </p> <p>Shadow chancellor George Osborne said Brown's comments were effectively an admission of the failure of the policies which he had pursued while chancellor. \"Gordon Brown has now accurately described his time in office as the 'age of irresponsibility',\" he said. \"For 10 years he presided over a debt-fuelled boom and failed to call time on debt.\"</p>",

  "<p>007 was something of a label queen with his accessories: Ronson lighter, triple-banded Morland cigarettes, Pinaud Elixir shampoo - aka \"that prince among shampoos\" - soap by Floris, Rolex watch ... </p> <p>It could be argued that, with all these references, Fleming singlehandedly invented male style journalism. Yet Bond's clothes were remarkable for their taut, under-designed discretion. 007 was always required to wear a kind of well-tailored but unobtrusive glamourflage; kit that could parlay him to a ritzy Monte Carlo casino or an edgy Harlem jazz club. Fleming's Bond never admits to a preference for Savile Row tailoring - in fact, Fleming never mentions any of Bond's clothing by label, preferring to describe, simply, \"a dark blue suit\" or \"a thin black knitted silk tie\".</p> <p>But when outlining the clothes of Bond's various barmy adversaries, Fleming turns into the forensic fashion scribe, outlining each item in detail, name-dropping labels all over the shop. In Thunderball, say, Count Lippe wore Charvet shirts, ties from Dior and Hardy Amies, shoes from N Peal, etc, as if to suggest that such a meticulous attention to one's wardrobe was somehow gauche, nouveau and dangerously narcissistic - a penchant for flash clobber going hand in hand with a psychotic desire to achieve world domination. That said, times are changing in the global megalomania arena: after Casino Royale, Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen, who played Le Chiffre, became the pan-global face of, not Smersh or Stromberg, but high-street outfitters H&amp;M. Watch out, Bond, he'll set his store detectives on to you ...</p> <h2>The best- (and worst-) dressed Bond baddies</h2> <p><strong>1: Auric Goldfinger, Goldfinger, 1964</strong></p> <p>Fleming is particularly unkind when styling Goldfinger's golfing wardrobe, describing him, archly, as a graceless arriviste who has gone to an outfitter's and said, \"Dress me for golf - you know, like they wear in Scotland.\" Togged up in thick socks, brogues, tweed plus fours and a cardie, in various tones of rust and mustard to acknowledge his obsession with hi-worth metallurgy (even his first name, Auric, means \"golden\"), Goldfinger comes off not as menacing but as cuddly, clumsy, comedic - Wodehousian, even - while slender, urbane Bond, in black sports casuals and a Doherty-esque trilby, looks much more the Gary Player-ish, 19th hole barfly. Later, while guiding a laser between Bond's legs (and issuing the memorable line, \"No, Mr Bond, I expect you to die!\"), Goldfinger wears a rather splendid Lurex tuxedo with a gold shawl collar that appears to have been designed by Hedi Slimane during his apprenticeship at High And Mighty.</p> <p><strong>2: Ernst Stavro Blofeld, You Only Live Twice, 1967</strong></p> <p>Back in the 60s, the default setting kit for a delusional, megalomaniacal nutcase, hellbent on world domination, was a vaguely Chinese tunic with buttons fastened all the way to the top. Accessorise with a vicious scar, a fluffy white cat and a big chair nicked from the Big Brother Diary Room, and before you can say, \"Ah, Mr Bond, I've been expecting you\", you have the archetypal Fleming bad boy. The initially scary Blofeld appeared in seven Bond films, played variously by six different actors (including Telly Savalas), but his Maoist suits remained a constant. </p> <p>That said, there's something distinctly Yohji-ish about Donald Pleasence's Blofeld wardrobe. It is clean, asexual, a bit arty and singular but also minimal and nicely finished. Other Blofelds added jetted pockets and military patch pockets, but Pleasence's monkishly unadorned cut is the most unsettling. The pinky ring - a big, ostentatious gold job fashioned in the shape of an Octopus (the Smersh logo) - is his only flirtation with blinging flamboyance. (Although, since Mike Myers' Bond baddie parody Dr Evil, it's impossible to look at Blofeld without one's little finger reaching for the corner of the mouth and the words \"one million dollars!\" spewing forth.)</p> <p><strong>3: Max Zorin, A View To A Kill, 1985 </strong></p> <p>The immaculately cold, deliciously arrogant Christopher Walken stepped in to play Zorin when David Bowie turned down the role, and you can see the Thin White Duke's influence in Bond's archenemy's steely Euro style. For much of the film, Zorin rocks the same oddly disturbing, formal-bland duds favoured by Bowie's businessman alien in The Man Who Fell To Earth. As one would expect from the product of a botched Nazi experiment, computer-chip mogul now resident in France, Zorin was coolly particular, hygienic and stylistically aloof rather than overtly fashionable, but in the odd scene his choice of closely tailored, three-buttoned suits predated similar ensembles by Prada by several years. And Walken's blond, bouffanted hair - only an inch or two off a Winehousesque beehive, in some scenes - is magnificent. </p> <p><strong>4: Jaws, The Spy Who Loved Me, 1977 </strong></p> <p>It's a good job this guy had some elaborately menacing dentistry to fall back on because, from the neck down, Jaws' very horrible chocolate-on-biscuit-beige outfit shows the distinct influence of nothing more intimidating than a crooning Terry Venables, or the kind of get-up that Bruce Forsyth would have worn to present the Generation Game. Actually, strike that; take off the head and you have a smart-casual, Tarby-at-Wentworth style that bears more than a passing resemblance to the outfit Gordon Brown wore on his recent holiday to Suffolk. His excuse? Because of his teeth, 7ft 2in Jaws was a metal-mouthed mute. This made the ordering of bespoke clothing something of a problem. </p> <p><strong>5: Dr Julius No, Dr No, 1962</strong></p> <p>The celluloid rendition of Dr Julius has a whiff of the Daft Punks about him. His crude, snub-ended bionic hands are pervy but fashionably sci-fi recherch\u00e9, and provide a shiny black accent to his off-white, fly-fronted, high-collared, Prussian-influenced tunic. Scary 46 years ago, yes, but nowadays you can get more stylish prosthetics on the NHS and Nehru-collared jackets are worn only by clueless Sloanes at charity balls.</p> <p><strong>6: Largo, Thunderball, 1965</strong></p> <p>There's a great bit in Thunderball where Italian extortion expert Emilio Largo walks in to a slickly appointed Paris boardroom. Two rows of nervous employees sit on wing-backed chairs, notebooks on laps, as their devastating boss saunters between them looking splendid in a dark, single-breasted suit, cut in the Milanese \"bum freezer\" style. This is the only time that one of 007's enemies got to do a catwalk show - fitting, really, because Largo remains the best-dressed Bond baddie of all time. Roman and animalistic, he accessorised with a piratical eye patch, a long stick thing (for pointing at big maps) and smouldering ciggie in a slightly camp holder permanently clamped in his mouth. When the action moves to the Bahamas, he looks marvellously insane in a white sharkskin dinner jacket (Fleming's Bond would only ever wear such a gauche item at sea). And what's not to love about a man who names his yacht Disco Volante?</p> <p><strong>7: Francisco Scaramanga, The Man With The Golden Gun, 1974</strong></p> <p>Played by Christopher Lee, Scaramanga's easy Catalan style paid unfortunate tribute to the US leisurewear craze of the 70s; so the shirt-cut white suit has a ghillie collar and feminine buttons, making our baddie look more benign Austrian pharmacist than ruthless assassin. The outfit is saved from terminal naffness by some choice accessories: nice cufflinks and a gold cigarette lighter that turns into a hand gun. </p> <p><strong>8: Mr Big/Dr Kananga, Live And Let Die, 1973</strong></p> <p>Were they to remake Live And Let Die today, Mr Big would probably be played by Snoop, Mos Def or The Game, and would be all gussied up like an MTV video pimp. Back then, a white blazer, a red shirt, a Chris Eubank haircut and some snooker ref's gloves were apparently enough to get Roger Moore's eyebrows twitching like a pair of fornicating caterpillars. Even less scary was Kananga's sidekick, a chap called Tee Hee, who had a metal clamp where his right hand should have been. He wore a scarlet jacket as a nod to his lust for bloody voodoo rituals, but actually looked like a jovial redcoat from Butlins.</p>",
  "<h2>The houseboat</h2> <p><strong>Pamela Chapman and Edward Burrell live on a 19th-century Dutch barge in Sunbury-on-Thames, where they brought up their daughter, Emily, 23</strong></p> <p><strong>Pamela:</strong> \"When Emily was born, we were living on a smaller barge in Richmond. Looking back, I don't know how I did it. I had two dogs, and a baby, and shopping, and had to carry all this stuff across a wobbly houseboat on to our barge on the other side. You only had to step on the houseboat and it tipped - not like the big solid old thing we have now - and the water was pretty fast when the tide was up. I'd wanted a home birth but was told it was out of the question because of access. </p> <p>\"We moved here when Emily was four. It's a very social way of life. Most of our friends had young children and we had wonderful boat rallies. Emily comes back to the boat whenever she can. It's her 'country' house. She's currently living in a flat but wants to buy back the boat we had in Richmond. </p> <p>\"The freedom is wonderful, the fact that we can just untie the boat and go. I think I would be claustrophobic in a house. It's all an adventure. Six years ago, we went across the Channel. The crossing was calm but going round to Dover was very rough. We had a budgie and a goldfish and I don't think they liked the china crashing around!</p> <p>\"Just being by water is relaxing. I work in London a lot and hate the journey but it's so peaceful when you come back. Even people who can't sleep say it's the best night's sleep they've had. The boat gently moves and I think that helped with Emily as a baby.</p> <p>\"People ask if it's cold in winter, but it's cosy and warm with a log fire. It doesn't feel cramped. When we bought this bigger boat we made sure there was a back cabin where Emily, or we, could take friends so we had a separation zone between us.</p> <p>\"I lived in loads of places before and was never settled. As soon as I got the boat, I was happy. It's a moveable feast, so maybe there's a bit of gypsy in my soul that needed that. And maybe we've given that to Emily. She loves to travel - she went around the world at 18. So long as we're healthy, this will be our lifestyle. I suspect that, if things go the way Emily wants, hers will be similar. It's nice to be different.\"</p> <h2>The earth shelter</h2> <p><strong>Jerry Harrall, 46, lives in Long Sutton, Lincolnshire, with his wife, Kay, and their children, Penelope, 14, Royston, 12, and Molly, 10. Their home is an earth-sheltered eco-dwelling he built himself</strong></p> <p><strong>Jerry:</strong> \"I was embarking on a doctorate 12 years ago and wanted to design a home that didn't require heating, so we're living here as a result of research. Although we have no heating, the temperature remains between 18 and 21\u00b0C. Occasionally we get called Teletubbies or Hobbits, but we're not underground - we're in a bungalow covered in earth. I think we've created an environment of serenity and tranquillity that demonstrates to the children how we can have a comfortable life without reliance on fossil fuels.</p> <p>\"One side faces south with a lot of glass, so we have a high level of daylight. The rest, including the roof, is covered in 2ft to 10ft of earth planted with ivy, which reduces the rate of heat loss and acts as sound-proofing. The house is built of heavyweight materials that act as a storage heater. Then the entire perimeter is super-insulated with extruded polystyrene. </p> <p>\"I think the children are calmer here, with the chance to reflect and contemplate. Their senses aren't bombarded by the built environment. It's the same as if you go into a cathedral or a castle: the high-mass superstructure protects you from the environment outside. It gives your brain a chance to rest. You get a good night's sleep and wake up refreshed. </p> <p>\"They say their friends' homes are stuffy and dark - that's because they're covered in carpets, vinyl and plasterboard, which harbour dust mites and mould growth, and we've got high daylight levels. Whenever we go away, the children all ask if the central heating can be switched off or windows opened. They can't sleep, and want to get out. </p> <p>\"The children like the linear layout because they can run up and down - and they've been caught skateboarding down the corridor.</p> <p>\"We've been living here since the end of 2002. We spent four years up to then living in a 30ft caravan on site - with three children. It was hell. It was a time fraught with tension and anxiety and I have memories of shouting a lot. But the children's benchmark will be this home. I don't want them to feel it's exceptional, though. As they get older, I'm hoping they'll demand healthier environments as the norm.\"</p> <h2>The lighthouse</h2> <p><strong>Frank and Danielle Sheahan run a guesthouse in West Usk lighthouse on the Severn estuary near Newport. They have two sons, Jed, 17, and Brodie, 14</strong></p> <p><strong>Frank: </strong>\"At school, Jed and Brodie are known as the lighthouse kids and they say it gives them street cred. When the bed and breakfast is quiet, their friends think it's a cool place to stay over because all the rooms have en-suites and TVs. When they were younger, we'd all go up into the lamp-room to watch electrical storms. They're amazing - like a fireworks display. The view is fantastic. You can see right over the estuary to England. </p> <p>\"The sea is about 30ft away. Along the foreshore, the children used to spend hours making dens out of washed-up tree trunks, flotsam and jetsam. I once had to rescue a family who got stuck on the mudflats; I waded out with my stick and a pack of beers and guided them back. And, in 2004, a 40-tonne whale got stranded on a sandbank just outside. It was very sad. The children would never have experienced that in London. </p> <p>\"Living and working in the capital at the mercy of the transport system and office politics brought us here. Danielle spotted the lighthouse for sale in Exchange &amp; Mart in 1987. It was semi-derelict and they wanted \u00a380,000 for it, but it was so peaceful we could hear the cows munching the grass. It was the ticket to get out of London.</p> <p>\"It took us six months to make it habitable, then we let it out. We finally quit London in 1989, got married here, then opened as a B&amp;B. The rooms are wedge-shaped and the stone spiral staircase is a wonderful feature.</p> <p>\"There was a big storm once and the waves were spilling over. But lighthouses are built to take a hammering. And there's a psychological aspect to living in a round structure: you feel protected. The closeness of the elements is part of the fun. At night, it's pitch dark out there but then you will see a ship coming in with all its lights on like a Christmas tree.</p> <p>\"On the negative side, you can't simply pop next door to a mate's house. Being in the middle of nowhere, the children are reliant on us to take them everywhere. And I think there are times when the children resent having paying guests. But it means that we can live in this unique building. And for Jed's 18th birthday, we're going to close the B&amp;B and have his party up on the terrace. How cool is that?\"</p>",
  "<p>How much difference will the departure of George W Bush make to the politics of climate change? The answer as of today is: not enough. Both candidates for his job have acknowledged the need for action, but not such as to threaten the inalienable right of US motorists to cheap gas. And the boldest initiatives that now seem politically feasible in America will scarcely make a dent in the problem.</p> <p>For one thing, there is much less of a consensus in the US about the nature of the threat than exists in Europe, and powerful vested interests stand in the way. Four of the key swing states - Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and West Virginia - are built on coal, while others such as Iowa have big biofuel interests.</p> <p>For another, the sheer complexity of America's energy system is a serious barrier to progress. To take one example, there are more than 3,000 separate electric utility companies spread across the country, all of them given incentives to sell as much power as possible from the cheapest energy sources. There are three regional grids, with limited interconnection. And there are armies of sometimes competing regulators, at local, state and federal level.</p> <p>Hence the importance of Thomas Friedman's new book. In many ways, it's a maddening read for Europeans, and not just because it ignores the EU and the lead that it has taken on this issue. Friedman's style is all-American. He believes the vital role of the US is to stand as \"a beacon of hope and the country that can always be counted on to lead the world in response to whatever is the most important issue of the day\". But his arguments are pitched squarely at American readers, and his is an influential voice. His last book, The World is Flat, became required reading in the corner offices of Fortune magazine, and his latest offering is designed to win over the same sceptical audience.</p> <p>The starting point is that ending America's addiction to oil is not just an environmental necessity - it is also a strategic and economic imperative. Oil dependency makes dictators stronger, democratic countries weaker and radical terrorists richer. Rather than staying on this course, business and the country as a whole should see the development of a clean energy infrastructure as a source of competitive advantage. Friedman claims that the greatest thing that the US could do today for itself, and for the whole world, would be to announce its intention to \"outgreen China\" - by taking a commanding lead in the race to build the next great global industry: clean power.</p> <p>Not only would such a goal bring strategic, economic and environmental benefits, it might also help to strengthen the role of civil society in China, as citizens start to speak out against environmental excesses. \"The Chinese Communist party will not be able to deliver on its promise to its people of the freedom to breathe unless it gradually but steadily starts to grant more of them the freedom to speak.\" And the best way to do all this is not through rules and regulations, or international treaties, but by way of \"the most effective and prolific system for transformational innovation and commercialisation of new products ever created on the face of the earth - the US marketplace\". </p> <p>Friedman's big idea is the creation of what he calls the energy internet - a world in which consumers of electricity will be empowered by innovative technology to maximise energy efficiency, choose different sources of supply at different times and at different prices, and sell any power they generate themselves back into the grid. Most of what's needed already exists, at least on paper: the challenge is to bring down the cost and change the rules to make it all possible.</p> <p>All this is aimed at those who think climate change is a hoax devised by pony-tailed tree-huggers. Technology and America's spirit of innovation will do the trick, and bring economic benefits into the bargain. But it's not enough to rely on market forces, at least in the way that they currently operate. Friedman recognises the vital role for government, in introducing demanding targets to spur industrial change; in setting standards to raise the energy efficiency of goods and services; above all, in giving price signals that the market needs in order to operate effectively. That could mean the introduction of a carbon tax, a floor price for oil, a cap and trade system for reducing greenhouse gas emissions - or some combination of all three. California has started down this road. But it will be a very hard sell across the rest of the US, as Senators Warner and Lieberman found with the failure of their attempted legislation this summer.</p> <p>Even the ever-optimistic Friedman occasionally seems daunted by the scale of the challenge. There are no quick fixes, despite the flood of US publications offering articles such as \"205 Easy Ways to Save the Earth\". The US is going to have to redefine its ideas of a middle-class lifestyle and set a very different example to the world. But in doing so, Friedman suggests, it can rediscover its sense of national purpose. As short-term economic problems pull political and public attention away from long-term threats to the environment, America needs a forceful advocate like Friedman to make this case for change.</p> <p>\u2022 Richard Lambert is director general of the CBI</p>",
  "<p>For much of his career John le Carr\u00e9 has been pigeonholed as a practitioner of genre fiction. But whereas the spy novel has traditionally induced an appealing but limited frisson of fear in the reader, presenting a threat to the moral and political establishment which is then resolved by the triumph of the hero and the state whose interests he represents, Le Carr\u00e9 has never dealt in comfort or certainty. His novels depict a bleak world in which the clarity of ideology, morality, patriotism, professional duty and personal loyalty dissolves into a fog in which his characters flounder, groping for some sort of basis on which to live and act. In this respect his work feels closer to postwar existentialism or the central European absurdist tradition than the kinetic action thrillers or puzzle-solving whodunits with which it is often shelved.</p> <p>With the end of the cold war there were those who wondered whether Le Carr\u00e9 would survive the collapse of the binary opposition which gave his fictional grey area its compelling atmosphere. From the 1990s onwards, in novels such as The Constant Gardener, he turned his attention to the new nexus of corporate and state power, the decentralised network of interests which have gone on to define the 21st century global order. Now, as the contours of the post-9/11 state of emergency become clear, he has published his 21st novel, A Most Wanted Man, which deals with the war on terror and its attendant abuses. It opens as a Turkish immigrant couple in Hamburg reluctantly take in a young Russian vagrant, a devout Muslim called Issa, who says he is from Chechnya. Issa's presence in Germany is a mystery. He has been smuggled across the border, bears the psychological and physical scars of torture, and is carrying a large sum of money. Is he a militant? A refugee? Is his unworldly persona in fact an elaborate cover for something more sinister? Drawn into his orbit are several recognisable Le Carr\u00e9 types. Annabel Richter is a young and idealistic immigration lawyer who takes Issa on as a client, hoping to prevent his deportation. Gunther Bachmann is an experienced intelligence agent, who sees the boy as a thread which he can pull to unravel a complex skein of jihadi finance. Tommy Brue is the ageing Scottish head of a small private bank, an old-fashioned operation which has a number of financial skeletons in its closet.</p> <p>The fact that these people feel immediately familiar to his fans is both Le Carr\u00e9's strength and his weakness. Bachmann the spy is sketched in a few paragraphs, which are both rich in incidental detail (\"[he] had by the age of 30 run away to sea, trekked the Hindu Kush, been imprisoned in Colombia, and written a thousand-page unpublishable novel\") and somehow perfunctory. Brue and Richter are more interesting, affording the author an opportunity to pick at scabs of class and status to get at the wounds beneath. Richter is the daughter of a senior diplomat, and her radicalism seems to be a way of escaping her privileged background. Brue, the nearest thing in the novel to an authorial proxy, is trapped in the ossified world of European old money and falls in modest and distant love with her, taking on her problems, and discovering that \"in doing so he had consciously and deliberately entered her danger zone, which he now shared with her. And in consequence, his life had become vivid and precious to him, for which he thanked her from all his heart.\"</p> <p>In a recent interview Le Carr\u00e9 was asked if he ever considered defecting. \"Well, I wasn't tempted ideologically ... but when you spy intensively and you get closer and closer to the border ... it seems such a small step to jump ... and, you know, find out the rest.\" Though this has been reported as some sort of tabloid confession (\"I was tempted to defect, says spy novelist Le Carr\u00e9\"), it seems primarily interesting as a key to his fiction, whose central concern is the exploration of the metaphorical borderland occupied by the proponents of any polarised conflict. In the cold war, the security establishment was deeply invested in proclaiming the evils of communism. Why? Le Carr\u00e9 offers the wry suggestion that it was prophylactic: they beat the drum for certainty because they understood the perilous ease with which they - in particular, the cold warriors - could slip over to the other side, the small step it would take to find themselves in the communist mirror-world. So the pathological anti-communist becomes, like the swaggering homophobe, a figure of insecurity, protesting loudly and too much. And the ordinary spy, a man perhaps like the young John Cornwell, toiling in his Bonn office, immersed in the minutiae of the system on which he is spying, finds the bureaucratic abstraction of his task leading to a sort of Marxist disillusionment, as evinced in the Communist Manifesto: \"All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life, and his relations with his kind.\"</p> <p>As a key to A Most Wanted Man, Marx's apprehension of the brutal truth of human social relations can usefully stand alongside another famous quotation, EM Forster's statement that \"If I had to choose between betraying my country and betraying my friend, I hope that I should have the guts to betray my country.\" Betrayal and the conflict between different kinds of loyalty form one recurrent theme of Le Carr\u00e9's fiction. The all-too-human desires of his characters - for loyalty, love and friendship - become terrible vulnerabilities when exposed to the \"real conditions of life\", the inhumanity of the realpolitik that governs the secret world.</p> <p>In A Most Wanted Man, such vulnerabilities are ruthlessly exploited. The novel's centre, the damaged young man known as Issa (whose name, significantly, is an analogue of Jesus), becomes a kind of blank screen for the hopes, fears and desires of the banker, the lawyer and the spy. At times his plight makes him genuinely poignant. At others he is little more than a cipher, a faint echo of Prince Myshkin in The Idiot, a \"monk with coal-dark eyes\" who speaks in a wildly uneven linguistic register, sometimes childlike, sometimes incongruously using words such as \"malodorous\". Issa is another incarnation of a familiar Le Carr\u00e9 type, the loose cannon, someone whose psychological precariousness and social disconnection make them disruptive of the established order - and useful to the puppeteers of the human soul who run the intelligence services. Some of Le Carr\u00e9's agents are people for whom this is an active talent - Jerry Westerby in The Honourable Schoolboy, Leamas in The Spy Who Came In From The Cold. Others, such as the actress Charlie in The Little Drummer Girl, are mere pawns in the intelligence game. Here Issa's passive unworldliness is a trait that destabilises the very worldly people who are drawn to him, inducing a sort of sentimental nobility that opens them up to tragedy.</p> <p>As ever, Le Carr\u00e9 is particularly good at portraying the quiet ruthlessness of intelligence organisations, and the terror of the moment when an unsuspecting person drops through the trapdoor that separates the everyday world from the secret one. He understands the ecstasy of confession (\"there was a certain relief, even pleasure, in becoming a child again, in handing the big decisions of her life to people older and wiser than herself\") and the subtleties of the relationship between interrogator and subject. The exploitation of human weakness both fascinates and disgusts him, and he is able to weave the familiar elements of his fictional universe into a plot that unwinds satisfyingly and with a certain sickening inevitability. A Most Wanted Man is an uneven book, but despite its flaws it stands as one of the most sophisticated fictional responses to the war on terror yet published, a humane novel which takes on the world's latest binarism and exposes troubling shades of grey.</p> <p>\u2022 Hari Kunzru's latest novel is My Revolutions (Penguin)</p>",
  "<p>The good bits first: Rowan Williams is an excellent literary critic. He makes you want to read, or reread, everything that Dostoevsky wrote. The books that he describes are spacious enough to contain a whole world, and beautiful enough to serve as icons that illuminate ours. For Williams, the activity of the novelist - at least of Dostoevsky - is pretty close to the divine: \"Dostoevsky works on the basis that the novelist is able to show in some degree what divine creation might be like.\" Novelists, he says, work by disappearing towards their characters. The less the characters seem constrained by anything except the workings of their own inner necessities, and those of other characters, the greater is the novelist's skill; and the more closely, Williams believes, does the novelist's creative work resemble that of God.</p> <p>If we take this reasoning on a little further, the fact that we, as characters in God's creation, are free - indeed, compelled - to doubt his existence must be the ultimate proof of his skill as a creator. This is not proof as the world understands it.</p> <p>But then there is much here that defies the understanding of the world; and here we come to the bad bit. The archbishop's mind is one of eternal fractal elaboration. Each thought produces its opposite; each qualification must be qualified; each pool of sense must be adulterated with a dash of nonsense. There were times when I wondered whether I was struggling through the worst prose ever written by a poet. Sometimes the thought disintegrates entirely, like a jellyfish dropped in a jacuzzi: \"The absolute necessity for recognition in the exchanges of dialogue means that, while we can indeed at one level say what we please (that two and two are not four), the construction of a life requires that we discover how we can speak in a way that does not just repeat or reproduce what is given, yet is at the same time occupying the same world of thought and perception that others in their speech inhabit. Speech may be free but it needs to be bearable - otherwise it fails finally to be language at all.\" The irony of a man writing so badly about the necessity of writing well is hardly to be borne.</p> <p>None of this would matter if Williams had nothing to say. But he does have worthwhile things to say, and not just about Dostoevsky. He appears to be arguing that God is neither an explanation for anything in the world, nor a fact about the world: \"The difference between the self-aware believer ... and the conscious and deliberate atheists is not a disagreement over whether or not to add one item [God] to the sum total of really existing things. It is a conflict about the policies and possibilities for a human life: between someone who accepts the dependence of everything on divine gratuity and attempts to respond with some image of that gratuity ... and someone who denies the dependence and is consequently faced with the unanswerable question of why any one policy for living is preferable to any other.\"</p> <p>You can disagree that an atheist cannot answer the question of why any policy for living should be better than any other - we answer it by living - but it is surely important that the Archbishop of Canterbury thinks that God's existence is one of the less important things about Him and gives reasons for this. I don't mean that he is halfway to atheism, but that his position is some distance from the one that atheists normally attack.</p> <p>His discussion of icons is a wonderful fusion of literary criticism and theological exposition, which makes more sense of the Christian understanding of the incarnation than almost anything I have ever read on the subject: \"What makes images sacred is not some magical invulnerability or supernatural protection but their capacity to retain in themselves the real energy of another world, transmitted into the world of isolated and death-bound agents. The icon is in this sense a 'powerless' image, in that it is not safe from what history may do to it; the crucifixion of the fully incarnate image of God lets us know that. But a vulnerable image is not an empty one.\"</p> <p>It will surprise some people to find what a large role he ascribes to the devil. The modern, global market, now crashing round our ears, seems to Williams diabolical because it reduces people to instruments, when to God we are all ends in ourselves: \"The point at which the activity of nursing the sick can be expressed in terms of a producer supplying a customer is the point at which the culture of nursing the sick begins to disappear. It is replaced by contractual negotiations of power between the two interests represented, producer or supplier and consumer: whose will is going to be secured and protected? What do I need to concede in negotiation so as to secure the maximum amount of liberty for my future choices? And when such contracts cease to be satisfactory, there is no relation left; the other has ceased to be properly instrumental to my will and can be safely discarded.\"</p> <p>Reviewing the work of such a subtle and energetic mind, there is always the danger of making a fool of oneself, rather like the general reporter sent along to cover a piano recital, who got a knowledgeable friend to write the whole review, full of searching and subtle criticism, but feeling he ought to add something of his own, wrote at the end: \"Mr Rubinstein was observed to play with equal facility on the black keys as on the white ones.\" Nonetheless, I do wish that Williams had mastered the use of the backspace and delete keys. He'd have said a lot more if he had, and a book which argues that the fundamental activity of the divine is dialogue might find more readers if he paid them a little attention.</p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Brown's Fishing in Utopia: Sweden and the Future that Disappeared is published by Granta</p>",
  "<p>The Bank of England yesterday joined other central banks around the world in its biggest and boldest attempt to unfreeze international money markets, which remained paralysed by the delay in approving the huge US bank bailout.</p> <p>Hard-pressed commercial banks were cheered as the Bank said it would switch $30bn from overnight to one-week funds after officials became alarmed at how lending of longer than one day had dried up. They also put up another $10bn in overnight funds. Another \u00a340bn will be auctioned for three months on Monday, taking banks through the traditionally slow Christmas period. </p> <p>The Bank also said it would broaden collateral limits to include mortgage securities. </p> <p>The Bank has been accused of acting too slowly in dealing with the credit crunch, which has rattled markets and pushed Britain towards its first recession since the early 1990s. </p> <p>The Bank also joined the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank in collectively putting up $74bn of one-week dollar money into markets. </p> <p>Demand from cash-hungry banks, particularly for the ECB cash, was hefty as lending between banks had been almost paralysed. \"There is no term lending of note between counterparties. Any term funding there is, is coming from the central banks,\" said Meyrick Chapman, rates strategist at investment bank UBS. </p> <p>Earlier in the day, the central banks of Japan, Australia and South Korea had pumped in cash to lubricate their respective markets. </p> <p>The liquidity injections are significant because this week the central banks have concentrated their fire-fighting efforts on overnight money markets.</p> <p>Bankers and analysts said the moves could help shore up confidence in interbank lending and allow banks to operate more normally, possibly eventually boosting mortgage lending, which has all-but dried up this year.</p> <p>\"This is a huge step forward and reflects the fact credit markets have almost totally seized up over the last week and a half,\" said Philip Shaw, chief economist at broker Investec. \"Sterling markets are under huge amounts of strain. The maturity is important because banks cannot build asset books around one-week liquidity.\" </p> <p>Commercial banks, which have been calling for more action from the Bank of England, welcomed the injection of funds. Stuart Gulliver, chief executive of Global Banking and Markets at HSBC, said: \"It's what the market was looking for. It shows a willingness to listen and will alleviate stresses in the UK banking system right through year-end\", referring to the fact that money markets tend to be highly illiquid over the Christmas holiday. </p> <p>Since the collapse of Lehman Brothers a fortnight ago, the money markets have been frozen. Not only have the banks become more reluctant to lend to each other, problems facing money market funds have also hit sentiment, keeping the rates abnormally high.</p> <p>For example, three-month London interbank offered rates (Libor) remained at around 6.26% yesterday, more than 1.25 points above Bank base rate of 5%. By contrast, last summer, when the Bank rate was 5.75%, Libor was at 6.1%.</p> <p>The rescue takeover of HBOS by Lloyds TSB has also highlighted the problems of raising funds in the financial markets - and ultimately forced the country's biggest mortgage lender into the arms of Lloyds TSB less than a day after it had insisted it was a rock-solid bank. </p> <p>There are concerns this weekend about Bradford &amp; Bingley, which also uses the money markets to raise funds, as did Northern Rock.</p> <p>The extraordinary conditions in the money markets also led to concerns yesterday about the fate of the Dutch-Belgian bank Fortis, which was forced to call an emergency press conference to insist it was not about to collapse. </p> <p>The political argument over the credit crunch continued yesterday as the prime minster, Gordon Brown, said during a visit to New York that it was time to end the \"age of irresponsibility\" and called for tighter regulation of financial firms.</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p>The Bank of England's emergency operation is a significant move. It is trying to help generate lending between banks in \"longer-term\" markets - one month and three months - rather than focusing on overnight and one-week markets. High street banks have been asking the Bank of England to inject more liquidity and follow the example of the European Central Bank and US Federal Reserve. The Bank is injecting \u00a340bn of three-month funds into money markets and switching most of the money it was offering from overnight funds to one week. It is also responding to the high street banks' pleas to be able to use a wider range of collateral, including mortgage-backed securities. <br><strong>Jill Treanor</strong></p>",
  "<p>What do you do if you are a three times-married struggling single mother called Erin Brockovich and Julia Roberts adopts your name, wins an Oscar for the movie and makes you one of the best known women in the world with a film that has taken more than $256m (\u00a3140m)? Do you: (a) change your life and become an instant celebrity? (b) make some vapid TV shows and write an autobiography, or (c) become one of America's leading environmental campaigners?</p> <p>All three, if you are the real Erin Brockovich, the once lowly-paid, unqualified legal clerk whose investigation brought the giant Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&amp;E) company to its legal knees - after she exposed how it dumped the carcinogenic chemical hexavalent chromium into unlined pits which polluted drinking water near the desert town of Hinkley, in California. </p> <p>Going back to Hinkley over and over again, she dug out hundreds of people suffering everything from nosebleeds and cancers to Hodgkin's disease, miscarriages and spinal deterioration. She herself got rashes after drinking the water. \"I could actually see people, animals and trees dying. I have been to the funerals,\" she says. </p> <p>Although it is hard to pin specific illnesses on any one chemical or company, the untutored Brockovich - who dropped out of college - succeeded, and it eventually cost PG&amp;E more than $650m (\u00a3350m) in civil lawsuits, the last of which has only just been concluded.</p> <p>The poisoned residents got payouts of about $100,000 each, but Brockovich struck gold. There was a $2.5m bonus and promotion to research director of the law firm; there was a mansion in the Californian hills, and the bestselling memoir. There was a mini-break into TV in the style of Anneka Rice; and thousands of requests from communities around the world to help them, too. </p> <p>But personal dramas carried on following the former Miss Pacific Coast beauty queen around. Within months of the movie coming out in 2000, she had divorced her husband. Soon afterwards another former husband and an ex-boyfriend were arrested and charged, along with a lawyer, with trying to extort $310,000 from her. The lawyer was jailed for six months and disbarred for life, but charges against the other two were dropped. </p> <p>Brockovich admits an equal instinct for trouble and glamour. Perhaps it's the way she stands 6ft tall, and wears four-inch high heels and literally talks down to most men, but she helped shake up the earnest US environmental movement.</p> <p>\"We had this idea of what a hero or an environmental advocate should be. I blew that when I came out with big hair and a bustier. I've been called Rocky in stilettos. But you don't have to have a PhD to be a humanist,\" she says. </p> <p>She now works for two law firms, one in LA the other in New York, both of which specialise in toxic exposure and the kind of mass torts or civil actions used against PG&amp;E. \"I get thousands of emails. Half my work is environment-related, the rest is pharmaceutical problems. There's so much of it. No one law firm can handle it now\". This week she has been in Europe, meeting the Irish environment minister and giving motivational lectures. Her speciality is water, and she is currently fighting two water pollution cases in Italy and Greece. \"It dawned on me then that we were destroying the very element needed for life - water. For me being green means cleaning up the water. Water is the key. Start with water. You can't ignore the fact that that nearly 80% of US waterways are potentially poisoned - benzene, solvents, heavy metals, pharmaceuticals ...</p> <p>\"I get thousands of requests from people near hex chromium sites. There's one in Cork. In Italy there are five. There's a huge one in Greece with readings 10 times higher that at Hinkley. Hell, the river there runs purple! We're about to take out a class action.\"</p> <p>What you really need, and she's got, she says, is stick-to-it-ive-ness. \"It's a noun. It means dogged persistence. Stubbornness. This is what I was taught. I was dyslexic, the least likely to succeed. It means things don't just happen, you have to make them happen.\"</p> <p>Which is why she is currently causing a stir in political circles in the US. Although she rates herself as a leading environmentalist, she is extremely keen on Sarah Palin, the huntin', shootin' Alaskan governor running for vice president with the Republican candidate John McCain. </p> <p>Environmentalists have painted Palin as the arch-enemy, to the right of Bush, because until last week she was denying climate change had anything to do with man, thought polar bears could go live on land and wants to see the Arctic drilled to within a quart of its oil. </p> <p>But Palin is also being called the \"Erin Brockovich of Alaska\" and last week, on her blog, Brockovich came close to endorsing Palin. \"Sure, she may be loud. So am I,\" she said. \"Sometimes you've got to scream to get anyone to hear you. So what if her 17-year-old is pregnant? None of us should judge Sarah Palin for anything but her own actions.\"</p> <p>What about her wanting to drill the arctic reserve? What about the bears and wolves that Palin shoots? </p> <p>\"No buts,\" says Brockovich. \"The fact is that Sarah Palin positively emanates strength. She gives off the aura of being a strong woman who doesn't back down, and she does it sporting heels and wearing her family like a badge of honour. I am sure there are a million other women out there who are doing the same thing.\" </p> <p>The blogosphere went wild, with people applauding or accusing. She denies moving to the right, pointing out that she's a registered Democrat, and says she'd be elated if asked to work with the Democrats. \"But it's not about politics. I don't pick a person because they are a Republican or a Democrat but for the person. I like Obama. I like McCain. Both have strong points\".</p> <p>Her real beef is neither capitalism nor industry, Democrats nor Republicans, she says, but greed. </p> <p>\"It's not that industry is bad. If we shut it down we do not progress. Greed is the problem. If PG&amp;E had done the right thing morally then we'd never have had this lawsuit, lives would have been saved and they would not have been out of $1bn. That's just bad business. Honesty hurts, but it's at least respectful of people. I see no change at all in industry.\"</p> <p>Sometimes she goes back to Hinkley. \"But I prefer not to. The chemical is still in the environment, the plume [of pollution] is still moving. The company is still buying houses there. I am the canary in the mine shaft. I still get rashes.\" </p> <p>The beauty queen once expected to parade and keep quiet now finds herself confused and angered by what is happening in the US and the priorities of people with power and influence. \"We have the money and the intelligence. We can find hundreds of billions of dollars [to bail out banks] but we can't find anything to clean up our water, the one element that sustains all life. I just don't get it.\"</p>",

  "<p>On a cold lino floor, in the front room of a Rotherham council house, Kya, aged five, and Robbie, two, crouch beside Styrofoam boxes eating their teas with their tiny fingers. One box contains chips covered in processed cheese, the other has doner meat shavings. It's the fourth take-away meal the kids have eaten that week. Mum Natasha, in her early 20s, admits that they've never eaten a home-cooked meal in their lives; a fact which the nigh-tearful Jamie Oliver is finding hard to digest.</p> <p>Jamie's new \"get Britain cooking!\" show, <strong>Jamie's Ministry Of Food (Tue, 9pm, Channel 4) </strong>is in stark contrast to his last feelgood swagger, Jamie At Home, where we witnessed a floaty, intoxicating dream of how a culinary life could truly be lived: five sorts of carrot, fresh chicory and exemplary endive growing in your garden beside a working kiln perfect for those ad hoc rustique cassoulets. This is all wholly possible, Jamie whispered, you can live this fantasy too.</p> <p>Sadly, somewhere in very real South Yorkshire, Natasha missed that memo. Maybe she was at the dentist with little Kya who had her sugar-destroyed rotting baby teeth removed last year. \"I've seen kids in Aids orphanages in Soweto with better diets than that,\" says Jamie after meeting her, sitting in his Range Rover, clearly upset.</p> <p>The pleasing, noteworthy thing about this series, however, is how much time is devoted to explaining Natasha and her friends' side of the story, instead of telling them off, or loading them on to the media ducking stool for a prime-time dunking. In episode one, we see Jamie guiding Natasha step-by-step through making spaghetti with meatballs. She's never chopped, fried or boiled a morsel in her life before and is terrified, yet unsurprisingly with a few hours of tuition can whip out the meal to perfection. She's not a bloody idiot, she's just totally poor with no confidence. News just in: these two things are different.</p> <p>Obviously, Jamie is elated by events; we all are, especially the sight of Robbie eating his first bite of non-mechanically retrieved meat product. \"I know I sound annoying, but I'm enriching these people's lives by teaching them this!\" announces Jamie, before flying off to save other corners of Rotherham from Type 2 diabetes.</p> <p>Four weeks later, Jamie returns to his star pupil's house to find Kya dining on cheese-chips again and Natasha knackered and ashamed, missing her gold rings which are in the pawn shop to keep the electric on. Suddenly, Jamie's vision seems utterly out of touch. Because the fact is Natasha's family never cooked, she never went to school much, therefore Natasha is bewildered by the kitchen and recipes if Jamie isn't there. She has no car and two kids, while the supermarket is on the outskirts of town and the takeaway is next door. She gets \u00a380 a week and she's drowning in unpaid bills; she's got nothing left to sell, she's crying a lot and the kids want cheese-chips so she's bloody well giving them some. Jamie stands in the kitchen as Natasha cries. \"Come here,\" he says, moving to give her a comforting hug. \"Get off,\" she says, pushing him away, denying the producers their \"crank up the Snow Patrol, here's the heart-warming bit\".</p> <p>\"Sorry, I'm just embarrassed,\" Natasha says eventually. \"I don't know how it gets like this. I really try with money, I do.\" Jamie, the multi-millionaire, hovers, trying to think of something to say. \"Look,\" he begins, \"I'm not going to say to you that I understand, because... well, erm, I don't.\" Other Rotherham residents point this out, too. \"The thing with you, Jamie,\" another woman tells him, \"is you live in a bubble. You've got no bloody idea what it's like for us.\" Well, if he didn't, it's dawning on him now and I still think he's an amazing man for trying.</p> <p>If this all sounds too bleak, then stick with new comedy <strong>Beautiful People (Thu, 9.30pm, BBC2)</strong>, a sort of camp, working-class British Arrested Development set in Reading starring Olivia Colman and Meera Syal which made me laugh more than anything I've seen so far on TV this year. Yes, an actually very funny British sitcom.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Wednesday October 1 2008. The review of a Jamie Oliver television programme, Jamie's Ministry Of Food, referred to him saving people from developing type 1 diabetes. It is type 2 diabetes that is strongly linked to unhealthy diet, obesity and a sedentary lifestyle. That is not the case with type 1 diabetes. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>I forgive David Marquand everything - resigning from the Commons and forcing a byelection which Labour lost, joining the Brussels bureaucracy, even becoming a founding father of the SDP. Beautifully written and bursting with insight as well as historical fact, Britain Since 1918 redeems it all.</p> <p>With the exception of the occasional page in which the journalist who still lurks within the author crams too much information into too few words, it is a joy to read. But despite the admirable optimism with which it ends - the Countryside Alliance and anti-war demonstrations are taken as evidence that \"the ancient British tradition of peaceful protest [is] alive and well\" - it reveals a depressing fact about the state of British democracy. </p> <p>These days, few (if any) politicians have time to spare for fundamental questions about what is, and is not, the good society. For 20 years the parties have shadow boxed about the best way to enjoy the benefits of the free market economy. And now that it has imploded they debate ways of restoring it to its previous reckless vigour. The idea that there is a better way disappeared with the arrival of the global market.</p> <p>The abdication from ideas is, in part, the product of the economic fatalism that afflicts modern politicians. Marquand, quite rightly, describes the cosy Keynesian concordat between capital and labour as a \"thing of the past\". The \"restless, dynamic capitalism of the late 20th and early 21st centuries, with its global scope, gross inequalities, predatory ultra-rich and powerless underclass [is] strikingly reminiscent of the capitalism of 100 years ago\". But in Victorian and Edwardian Britain there were men and women who believed that they could do more than mitigate the most brutal consequences of laissez-faire. Now there is too general an acceptance of \"the Thatcherite conclusion that Britain's individualistic and increasingly inegalitarian society is the only one on offer\". </p> <p>Over the past couple of weeks, the greed-driven competitive market has lost some of its charm. Politicians of what remains of the left ought to feel both guilt and embarrassment that they have spent so little time thinking about a superior alternative.</p> <p>Perhaps Britain's increased enthusiasm for \"the American model\" of a lightly or, better still, unregulated economy is one result of the \"special relationship\". Perhaps everyone else realised (though it was a revelation to me) that Winston Churchill's \"fight them on the beaches\" speech was intended to be an appeal for American intervention as well as a call for indomitable resistance. Britain would struggle on until \"the new world, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old\". </p> <p>America's crucial role in winning the war was not the beginning of Britain's hope for a \"special relationship\". But it increased the feeling of dependency. When Eisenhower reacted to the Suez conspiracy \"like a peppery headmaster chastising badly behaved schoolboys\", the French turned towards Europe. But \"British elites reacted in precisely the opposite way. The moral was that Britain must never again risk Washington's wrath . . . A little self-abasement was a price worth paying\". </p> <p>Harold Wilson, despite Britain's desperate need for economic help, resisted Lyndon Johnson's demands for a \"British presence\" in Vietnam. Unfortunately, Tony Blair did not do the same when George W Bush invaded Iraq. As Marquand puts it, he \"believed that Britain's special relationship with the United States had to be maintained at any cost.\"</p> <p>One of the many virtues of Britain Since 1918 is Marquand's uncompromising faith in the wisdom and decency of the British people. The politicians who govern them receive praise or blame according to deserts - with one notable exception: Clement Attlee was much more than a \"staff officer\". The \"welfare state\", as developed after 1945, was less a revolution than an extension of what had been begun more than 30 years before. But in one gigantic way, Attlee - in Churchill's phrase about Joseph Chamberlain - \"made the weather\". His personal intervention ensured that the long-held hope of Indian independence was realised. In consequence, he changed the world. Once India was free, the other colonies - French and Dutch as well as British - fell like liberated ninepins. And his personal qualities ought to make him one of Marquand's heroes.</p> <p>The opening chapters of Britain Since 1918 - virtually an introduction to the story of 20th-century democracy - are a book in themselves and certainly worth reading in their own right. John Milton is treated with proper reverence, because of his political philosophy as well as his poetry. As he wrote in A Free Commonwealth: \"They who are greatest are perpetual servants and drudges to the public at their own cost and charges, neglect their own affairs, yet are not elevated above their brethren; live soberly in their families, walk the street as other men, and may be spoke to freely.\"</p> <p>Attlee was that man. Marquand must recognise the dangers of political hubris and feel distaste for celebrity government. He knows too much about British politics - past and present - to do anything else.</p> <p>\u2022 Roy Hattersley's Borrowed Time: The Story of Britain Between the Wars is published by Little, Brown</p>",
  "<p>\"The waste remains,\" William Empson wrote in one of his villanelles, \"the waste remains and kills.\" The line might have served as an epigraph for Rose George's book, which looks at the toxic effects of poor sanitation and the heroic efforts of the visionaries who seek to improve it, from Joseph Bazalgette in 19th-century London to his heirs in the developing world today. By \"waste\" she doesn't mean the stuff that goes into wheelie bins or on to landfill sites; she means the unmentionables we flush down the loo - supposing we're lucky enough to have one. </p> <p>\"Shit\" is her preferred usage, rather than excreta, faeces or stools. The topic invites euphemism or tittering toilet humour, but she has an answer to those who think it beneath their dignity: how a society disposes of its sewage tells you a lot about its economy, politics and religion, she says. Disgust may be an understandable reaction (\"Oh! Celia, Celia, Celia shits,\" Jonathan Swift cried in horror), and the author is no coprophagist. But without rubbing our noses in it, she shows how the problems associated with shit are impacting on the Earth.</p> <p>The statistics are horrifying: 2.6 billion people - 40% of the world's population - with no access to a toilet or latrine; 90% of our sewage discharged, untreated, into oceans, rivers and lakes; 10 million viruses and 1 million bacteria in each gram of faeces; every 15 seconds a child dies of diarrhoea caused by contaminated water. In the face of such facts, polite avoidance of the subject seems irresponsible. But persuading people to discuss it openly (as they have learned to with formerly taboo subjects such as sex and death) is a struggle. An advertisement for Velvet toilet tissue in 2002, with artily photographed bare bottoms and the slogan \"Love your bum\", was the second most complained-about ad that year. Celebs will do their bit for WaterAid but not for sanitation. Even those in the industry are shy about admitting it, for fear the rest of us will back away.</p> <p>With no qualifications except an intrepid spirit and a resolve to look and learn, George visits some of the dirtiest places in the world. She goes down among the turds in London's sewers, finding the air surprisingly wholesome but the number of employees or \"flushers\" (a mere 30-odd for the whole of the capital) alarmingly small. She inspects school lavatories in South Africa (where they exist, and are clean, the attendance rate is higher), mingles with untouchables in India (though officially they no longer exist), samples a biogas stove in faeca-philiac China (it runs off converted human excrement), watches latrine pits being emptied in Dar es Salaam (sledgehammers and kerosene do the trick), and handles the sludge used as a fertiliser by American farmers (\"It looks and feels like a crumbled brownie\"). Less gruellingly, she samples state-of-the-art lavatories in Japan, which can check your blood pressure, play music and automatically put the seat down for you, but which have had no more success as an export to the US than the bidet did - to middle America, anal washing seems pervy and louche. Australia is about the only place George doesn't visit, though she does talk to Aussies in the business. Whenever there's a toilet conference, be it in Moscow or Bangkok, there she is with her notebook and an ear cocked for absurdity. </p> <p>Along the way, she explodes a number of myths. That we in the west are well sorted in terms of \"watsan\" (water and sanitation), for instance. Not so: recent years have seen outbreaks of disease from Galway to Milwaukee and catastrophic sewer overflows in London and New York. Nor are developing countries as indifferent to hygiene as popularly alleged: George meets countless evangelists waging war on ignorance, not least in India, where local initiatives have brought sanitation to villagers who used to squat in the bushes or next to ponds. The dream is to create a continent that's ODF, open defecation-free - no more bottoms discharging on to the railway in the slums of Mumbai and elsewhere.</p> <p>Though charmed by the evangelists, George is sceptical of their claims to lasting success. And having listened to the arguments on both sides, she can't decide where she stands on biosolids: are the Americans and Chinese who use human shit as fertiliser noble recycling pioneers or dangerous polluters? The book seems repetitive at times, because of its structure - part travel book, part reportage, part polemic - and it's a pity the notion of waste wasn't broadened out. It's an invaluable contribution nevertheless.</p> <p>\"Shit's shit,\" Andrew Motion once wrote (poets seem better at facing the issue head-on), \"and what we desire in the world is less, not more, of it.\" Less won't happen, with the global population expanding at its current rate. But given that \"sanitation is one of the best investments a country can make\" (good for health, tourism and the economy), it's bewildering how little is spent on it - whether in Pakistan (which spends 47 times more on its military, despite 120,000 diarrhoea-related deaths a year) or in the UK (where sewage systems in many cities haven't changed since Bazalgette). Rose George doesn't pretend to have the answers. But as she prods, pesters and provokes, she proves an excellent shit-stirrer. </p> <p>\u2022 Blake Morrison's South of the River is published by Vintage</p>",
  "<h2>Make apple cobbler</h2> <p>As autumn sets in, many English apples will be ready for harvest, making this the perfect time to try out some appley recipes. </p> <p>If you don't have an orchard or apple tree nearby, then the best source of English apples is from farm shops, traditional greengrocers and farmers' markets. For culinary purposes, make sure to pick cooking or dual-purpose apples. </p> <p>There are many types to choose from - from the traditional Discovery, to the naturally sweeter Annie Elizabeth that's perfect for stewing; or the Blenheim Orange, which has a crumbly texture and can be harvested now and stored up until Christmas. </p> <p>To use up any bruised windfalls, make this simple take on a traditional apple cobbler. Take half a dozen peeled and sliced apples, 1 cup of flour, 1 cup of soft brown sugar, 1 egg, a teaspoon of cinnamon and half a cup of melted butter. </p> <p>Place the apple slices in the bottom of a greased 8in baking tray. In a separate bowl stir the flour, sugar and cinnamon together, then mix in the whisked egg and sprinkle this topping over the apples. Cover it with the melted butter and bake in a hot oven for 30 minutes. Served warm with clotted cream this makes the perfect autumn treat.<br><strong>Lydia Fulton</strong></p> <h2> Build a xylophone</h2> <p>We began with a child's size mini xylophone. In order to extend this to make a giant xylophone, measuring 1.5m, we just scaled up the design. Beginning with the frame, which is roughly A-shaped, we screwed together four pieces of wood - it can be any length; it just needs to be strong and A-shaped. Then, for the bars, we made 25 all from pine, by just sawing the wood into lengths with our hacksaws. Each bar is 2cm longer than the previous one. Then each bar was drilled at each end (by an adult) using a 6mm drill bit, and all the bars were laid on to the frame with a gap between bars of approximately 5mm. </p> <p>Finally, the bars are held in place by nails through the holes. It's important that they can move a little to resonate the sound, so don't nail too close. Make sure that the bars aren't touching each other.

  "<p>John Vidal ('There are many tiger widows here', September 25) reports yet another tragedy for the people and tigers of the Sundarbans. Clearly the underlying causes include the corruption and poverty that have marginalised these communities, leaving them to struggle in a naturally inhospitable environment, and against the deforestation upstream that exacerbates the impact of the tidal floods. </p> <p>On the Indian side of the Sundarbans, community-led initiatives are inching towards local solutions. These have led to a reduction in the hunting of the tigers' natural prey, greater cooperation between the community and the Forest Department to relocate tigers instead of killing them, and alternative livelihoods and practices that benefit both tigers and people, such as community-run tourism and bee-keeping. </p> <p>The tiger and its survival is truly a symbol and reminder of our global need for better governance of our natural resources and to coming anywhere near fulfilling the UN's millennium development goals.<br><strong>Debbie Banks</strong><br>Environmental Investigation Agency </p> <p>John Vidal's article on Sundarban tigers didn't cover the main driver of tension between India's wild animals and its people - untrammelled population growth. Indian tigers' penises are much in demand from practitioners of traditional medicine in China. It is very unlikely that India will have any wild tigers in 20 years' time. This will be a consequence of impossible human pressure on their habitats and the money that a dead tiger can bring to desperately poor villages ignored by government. <br><strong>Cathal Rabbitte</strong><br>Mumbai, India</p>",
  "<p>As everyone knows, a successful self-help book cover must feature three things: first, a picture of a gold-encrusted scroll or chest, suggestive of ancient wisdom and untold riches; second, a picture of a smiling person, preferably Paul McKenna, to demonstrate the joy you'll achieve upon reading what's inside; and third, the letters \"PhD\", to reassure you that the author must be very wise because he or she once did a correspondence course in art history from the Internet University of the Cayman Islands. My copy of Judgment Under Uncertainty, edited by Daniel Kahneman, Amos Tversky and Paul Slovic, fails on all three counts: it's a dry collection of academic studies from 1982, so the cover has a boring, two-tone colour scheme; there's no mention of PhDs. This is a pity, since it may be, unintentionally, one of the most useful self-help books ever published.</p> <p>The researchers' basic point is this: when we lack definite information, we make very poor judgments, and we do so in predictable ways. We're notoriously terrible at assessing risk; we worry about all the wrong things. We fear events that bring vivid imagery to mind, such as terrorism, but not road accidents, though they're far more of a threat. (In studies, people are willing to spend more on travel insurance that would pay out $100,000 for death by terrorism than for insurance that would pay the same for death from any cause.) We fear things we can't control (air accidents) but not things we can (death by smoking). And we believe completely illogical things: most people, Kahneman found, are convinced that the murder rate in Detroit is higher than that in Michigan. </p> <p>Self-help's usual response to worry is to replace a glum or stress-inducing view of the future with an upbeat one: if you're convinced the worst will happen, just convince yourself the best will happen instead! But that rarely works. The findings of Kahneman et al suggest a different approach: rather than trying to change that feeling in your gut from negative to positive, learn to be sceptical of your gut feeling, whether it's negative or positive - because there's good reason to believe your focus is completely wrong. (There are sound evolutionary explanations for why we ended up this way, but our brains were designed for an environment in which we no longer live.)</p> <p>If you're prone to fretting, a simple experiment will reveal how much time you spend worrying about the wrong things. For a week, note down your main recurring fears about the immediate future, then look back and see what really happened. I tried this recently. Things went better than I'd imagined, obviously. But that wasn't the interesting part: what stood out was how many times reality bore no relationship to anything I'd anticipated. I'd worry about some event going badly, but instead of going badly or well, it'd be cancelled. I would worry about how I'd handle some crucial conversation, but by the time it arrived, circumstances had changed, and it wasn't crucial at all. My gut feelings weren't so much overly negative as simply irrelevant. <br><a href=\"mailto:oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com\"><br>oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Speculation intensified last night that Bradford &amp; Bingley's days as an independent bank were numbered, after its shares were pummelled and its market value fell to \u00a3390m, a fall of more than 90% from its peak.</p> <p>Shares in Lloyds TSB, HBOS, and Royal Bank of Scotland also dived, amid heightened concern over stability in the financial system if plans for the $700m (\u00a3378bn) US mortgage market bail-out fail.</p> <p>The financial authorities were reportedly scrambling for a solution for Bradford and Bingley, amid worry that the stricken lender might have to be nationalised if no solution can be found.</p> <p>Speaking in Washington, Gordon Brown last night refused to comment on reports that the leading buy-to-let mortgage provider faced nationalisation. \"I wouldn't comment, and nobody would expect me to comment, on these speculative statements made in newspapers,\" he said after talks on the financial crisis with George Bush. \"I'm not going to comment on any individual company or building society.\"</p> <p>But Treasury officials were reportedly preparing contingency plans in case the situation further deteriorates and a buyer fails to materialise. Nationalisation would be possible under legislation passed in February to allow the state to take over Northern Rock, but would saddle the exchequer with an estimated \u00a350bn in liabilities. The Financial Services Authority is known to have contingency plans for B&amp;B. The City regulator is thought to have considered lining up a bidder or splitting up the business.</p> <p>Depositors' savings are protected by the government guarantee scheme, but the sustained fall in B&amp;B's shares suggests investors have little appetite for the bank. They ended at 20p, against the 55p at which it tapped investors for \u00a3400m last month.</p> <p>B&amp;B's shares fell despite initiatives this week by new chief executive Richard Pym to restore confidence following downgrades by credit rating agencies. He has reduced \"toxic\" investments, cut 370 jobs, axed new mortgage business, and slashed \u00a31bn off a troubled deal with mortgage company GMAC.</p> <p>Last night there were reports some British banks are lobbying the Treasury to offer a general bail-out of the kind being offered to take toxic assets off the hands of ailing Wall Street institutions. Brown does not back a general British bail-out and wants to deal with crises on an institution-by-institution basis.</p> <p>Turmoil in bank shares came amid news that HSBC plans to cut 1,100 investment banking jobs, 500 of them at its Canary Wharf operations in London. That represents 4% of its global investment banking workforce but less than 1% of total headcount. </p> <p>The job cuts, by a bank regarded to have weathered the credit crunch better than most, raised fear of other redundancies.</p> <p>HSBC also announced the retirement of chief operating officer David Hodgkinson and the appointment of Ken Harvey to a new position of chief technology and services officer. The bank, seen as one of the strongest because it does not rely on wholesale markets for funding, played down suggestions its plan to integrate technology and operations would bring further job losses.</p> <p>HSBC has decided to cut its investment banking workforce because it expects market conditions to deteriorate and it wants to focus on emerging markets. The investment banking arm took \u00a32bn in write-downs from toxic investments in the first six months of the year.</p> <p>Unite, the union more usually associated with concern about members in high street banking staff rather than investment banking, expressed its disappointment at the redundancies. Derek Simpson, joint general secretary, said: \"We are now seeing the human cost of the credit crunch. We need action to end this crisis. This situation should never happen again, and that's why the financial services needs to be regulated more effectively.\"</p> <p>Traders in the fixed-income division of Lehman Brothers await their fate.

  "<p>Tim Cahill has moved out of Liverpool and taken up yoga to handle the pressures of his football-obsessed environment this year, but he accepts that there is no escape from the magnitude of the 208th Merseyside derby. Nor does the Australian international seek one.</p> <p>Everton's season could flourish or flat-line in the coming week, with Liverpool's visit to Goodison Park followed by Thursday's ominous second date at Standard Li\u00e8ge in the Uefa Cup first round. Defeat at Blackburn Rovers in the Carling Cup prompted Joleon Lescott to issue a public apology to the supporters who booed off David Moyes' team at Ewood Park and the manager's fears about assembling a team so late in the transfer window are being realised with every meagre display.</p> <p>With seven games gone and 14 goals conceded, Everton still await their first clean sheet of a faltering campaign. No way to be facing unbeaten local rivals or no better opportunity to dispel the despondency Cahill, a supreme optimist with or without breath control, has no doubt.</p> <p>\"Beating Liverpool would be the ideal lift and that is the only way we can look at it. That's the beauty of this game,\" said Cahill, who has scored twice since his premature return from injury to re-emphasise his value to Everton. \"The seriousness of this game goes beyond football, it goes into people's livelihoods. I lived in Liverpool for four years so I understand what it's like to walk down the street to get a carton of milk after a derby. I get loads of banter, especially from the Liverpool fans, but it's a compliment when you get a bit of bitterness because it shows you're a threat and I've had a habit of scoring against Liverpool a few times. It's all about passion.\"</p> <p>The 28-year-old understands the criticism at Ewood but insists it is a question of when, not if, last season's fifth-placed side gel with new signings such as the \u00a315m Marouane Fellaini. It is the constant search for answers in a divided football city, however, that led to Cahill moving his young family to leafier climes earlier this year.</p> <p>He admits: \"One of the best things I did was to move away from football and just to concentrate on my family and my kids. My problem was I was too enthused in it all. I slept, ate and breathed football and there was no outlet. Liverpool's a beautiful city with beautiful people but I needed to be able to switch off and go down the park with my kids without having to listen to an adverse comment. I still always go out for dinner in Liverpool and see the lads here, but I needed a release from football. I can relax now without worrying about people saying I'm crap.\"</p> <p>Cahill's relocation was out of choice, but it was necessary for the Everton midfielder to change his training routine, relaxation techniques and even his running style having fractured the same metatarsal three times in 12 months. The Australian underwent revolutionary surgery in Sydney in April, after visiting specialists in London, Manchester and the Netherlands, but credits working with Danny Donnachie, Everton's well-being and performance coach, and son of the former Scotland international Willie, for ensuring no psychological scars survived the repeat injury.</p> <p>\"I've changed the way I run, my footwear, the insoles, all sorts, and I've been doing yoga and Pilates of an evening, anything to help,\" adds Cahill. \"People might think that's a bit radical but you have to switch off outside of football. We have a regime at Everton now where Danny works with us individually on matters on and off the pitch. A big part of football nowadays is the mental aspect. It is not all about technique. It's about how we overcome losing to Blackburn in the cup or drawing with Hull, and we know if we beat Liverpool all that will be forgotten.\"</p> <p>One constant in Cahill's repertoire is his goal celebration of trading punches with the corner flag, an idea that originated with an international team-mate Archie Thompson and, thanks to Cahill becoming the first Australian to score at a World Cup finals, is now replicated throughout their homeland. \"We both had baby boys around the same time and it is a celebration for our kids,\" Cahill explains. \"We based it on the Nintendo Wii. Archie had a kung-fu celebration and I just spiced it up a little bit. It would be nice to do it more than once against Liverpool.\"</p>",
  "<p>House prices fell by 4.6% in the year to the end of last month, the Land Registry said yesterday, the first time its index has shown an annual fall since it was launched in April 2000.</p> <p>The figures showed sharp falls in August, with the average price of a home in England and Wales falling 1.9% to \u00a3174,493.</p> <p>Fewer mortgages and falling confidence in the housing market and wider economy are deterring buyers, and this lack of demand has translated into sharp falls.</p> <p>The Land Registry figures are based on completed sales, and cover only homes that have been sold before. Other house price indices, which are based on an earlier stage in the selling process, have been showing price falls for many months. The Nationwide and Halifax have reported annual falls in double digits.</p> <p>The Land Registry's figures show year-on-year price falls in every region of England and Wales, with the east of England experiencing the biggest property downturn. Prices in the region fell by 6.7% in the 12 months to the end of August to an average of \u00a3179,677. In August alone the average price of a property in the east fell by 3.9%. </p> <p>In London, prices fell 2.4% in August compared with July, and 3.2% over the year, the first annual fall since the index was launched.</p> <p>The Land Registry figures also highlight how far transaction volumes have plummeted since the downturn in the housing market began late last summer.</p> <p>Between March and June this year there were an average of 58,763 sales a month, compared with 108,163 for the same period last year.</p> <p>News that mortgage lenders are putting up their prices again as a result of the turmoil in the financial markets is likely to further subdue the market.</p> <p>This week, HSBC, the Woolwich and internet and telephone bank First Direct raised interest rates after the Libor rate - what banks charge each other to borrow - rose to 6.27%.</p> <p>\"Clearly, there is no let up in the major downward pressure on house activity and prices stemming from the damaging mix of stretched buyer affordability and very tight lending conditions,\" said Howard Archer, chief UK economist at Global Insight.</p> <p>\"The current financial sector turmoil is likely to deepen the pressure on housing market activity through further tightening credit conditions and exerting upward pressure on interest rates.\"</p>",
  "<p>Two streets, separated from each other by seven and a half miles and several billion dollars, united this week in an iron embrace that will see them either go down together or survive together.</p> <p>To the east is Wall Street, the stretch of imposing masonry in downtown Manhattan at the centre of the global financial meltdown. To the west, a hop across the Hudson, is Main Street in Newark, New Jersey, a stretch of clapboard houses and corner shops that is already feeling the cold blast of a downturn.</p> <p>Wall Street was named after the wall built in 1653 to protect the fledgling New Amsterdam settlement against the intrusions of the British. But few remember that now. What began as a defence for the common person was this week cast as the common person's enemy.</p> <p>At least, that is how the coalition of New York unions were portraying it at a protest rally against the proposed $700bn bail-out. \"Wall Street sucks,\" the crowd chanted outside the forbidding entrance of the New York Stock Exchange.</p> <p>Class war had come to Wall Street. As Arthur Cheliotes, president of the union of New York administrative employees, put it: \"There's a lot of anger among our members. Wall Street is handing us the bill for a party they never invited us to.\"</p> <p>During their lunch break from the pandemonium of the trading floor, several traders stood listening to the bile that was being directed at them. Gary, dressed in a navy blue trader's jacket, was bemused by what he heard. \"We're in a total mess, but I don't see how it's totally our fault. People keep bringing up CEOs and their huge pay - but they are just a tiny part of what goes on here.\"</p> <p>Asked whether he would class himself among the rich, he guffawed. \"If I knew any stock tips I wouldn't be here right now. I'm just like those union members - I work for a living.\"</p> <p>\"They say bail out!\" a union rep burst in as he bellowed at the protesters through loud speakers. \"We say get the hell out!\"</p> <p>Leonard Bauer, dressed in a standard-issue dark blue suit, told how he and his colleagues from Bank of America were working around the clock on the deal to buy Merrill Lynch.</p> <p>\"It's pretty messy,\" he said. \"The way the markets are going you have to work on everybody - this is not a question of us versus them.\"</p> <p>The don't-blame-us theme was continued by an insurance broker who preferred not to give his name (\"I think it's better not to.\") \"Everyone shares the blame. It's people outside Wall Street who tried to get a house they couldn't afford and a car they couldn't afford. Everyone has to take part of the blame and work together to fix this.\"</p> <p>Though it is less than eight miles away, Main Street in Newark is another country. The neighbourhood is so surrounded by railway tracks it is called Ironbound, and has a high concentration of Brazilian immigrant residents.</p> <p>There is none of the austere grandeur of Wall Street here, nor any of its sense of corporate power, and two storeys pass as high-rise. Despite the contrast, it quickly becomes clear that this Main Street, like Main Streets in towns across the United States, is umbilically linked to the financial powerhouse to the east.</p> <p>The owner of Betel bakery, which sells pao de queijo, coxinha and other Brazilian pastries and delicacies, says trade has been down by about a third since the financial crisis on Wall Street began. Nani Silva, drinking coffee in the bakery, supplies restaurants throughout New Jersey and New York, and she can put a clear figure on the slump.</p> <p>Before the crash, her customers used to buy $2,000 worth of supplies in a day; now they will spend less than $1,000. \"It's crazy right now,\" she says, adding that if it stays like this for much longer she will think of returning to Brazil, which she left four years ago.</p> <p>Down the street, Marcio Rodgrigues was unaware of the plan for a $700bn bailout until we informed him of it. \"Seven hundred billion dollars. Wow!\" was his reaction.</p> <p>He is in the local construction business, and says orders are down by at least half over the past few weeks, partly as a result of a spate of foreclosures that has swept the area as homeowners have become mired in debt. As we talk, he keeps returning to the figure of $700bn. \"That's a lot of money. They should give that to us, the taxpayers. If they did that, we would spend the money and the depression would be over.</p> <p>Jonatan Silva is a delivery man for a Brazilian hamburger joint at the end of the street. He survives mainly on tips, which is bad news because deliveries are sharply down. He backs the bail-out.</p> <p>\"I think it's cool. If it works it will mean we can work again, construction will start up again, people will order deliveries again and I'll get my tips.\"</p> <p>There's the link. The massive movement of stocks on Wall Street may seem a world away, but here on Main Street they are making all the difference to the dollars and cents of Silva's tips.</p>",
  "<p>It was, according to accounts filtering out of the White House, an extraordinary scene. Hank Paulson, the US treasury secretary and a man with a personal fortune estimated at $700m (\u00a3380m), had got down on one knee before the most powerful woman in Congress, Nancy Pelosi, and begged her to save his plan to rescue Wall Street.</p> <p>Please don't blow up this deal, Paulson pleaded. Pelosi tried to keep it light. \"It's not me blowing this up. It's the Republicans,\" she told him. Paulson sighed. \"I know,\" he said.</p> <p>The exchange - and those in the room said Paulson was only half joking - took place moments after a White House meeting that was supposed to endorse a $700bn bailout ended in acrimony.</p> <p>At the White House on Thursday afternoon were George Bush, and the two men who stand to inherit America's economic mess: Barack Obama and John McCain, along with other congressional leaders. In the 40 minutes the Democratic and Republican leaders sat around a long table, prospects for a rescue package slid from optimism to near despair. </p> <p>\"This sucker could go down,\" Bush is said to have told the group - referring to the teetering US economy.</p> <p>By late yesterday the fate of Paulson's plan remained unclear. One certainty emerged though from several days of drama and suspense: 10 hours before the start of last night's presidential debate McCain abandoned his threat of a boycott and flew to Mississippi to meet Obama.</p> <p>How did it come to this? What happened to a deal that had been so close to fruition before the meeting at the White House? And what was McCain's role, saviour or saboteur? By yesterday afternoon, angry Democrats were accusing McCain of sabotaging the deal to further his own presidential campaign - and even some Republicans were inclined to agree. \"Clearly, yesterday, his position on that discussion yesterday was one that stopped a deal from finalising,\" the Republican whip, Roy Blunt, told reporters.</p> <p>Mike Huckabee, a former rival of McCain for the Republican nomination was also critical of his tactics, calling the threat to postpone the debate a mistake.</p> <p>\"You can't just say, 'World, stop for a moment. I'm going to cancel everything,'\" Huckabee told reporters in Alabama.</p> <p>The intertwining of presidential politics and America's credit crisis began at 8.30am on Wednesday morning when Obama put in a call to McCain, proposing the two candidates suspend their rivalry to issue a joint statement on the bail-out.</p> <p>By that point, it was becoming clear that Paulson's rescue package was playing far better on Wall Street than in the rest of the country. Republicans and Democrats balked at the huge sums to be marshalled by the effort to bail out corporate institutions at a time when voters were hurting.</p> <p>It was also becoming evident to both sides that, with an election six weeks away, a bail-out could be politically toxic.</p> <p>For McCain, the crisis had begun badly. Last week, as the markets were engulfed in uncertainty, he continued to repeat his signature statement: \"The fundamentals of our economy are strong.\" As late as Tuesday, the Republican admitted in an NBC interview that he had not taken the time to read the bail-out plan.</p> <p>But by Wednesday morning, it was impossible for McCain to ignore the economy and the damage it was doing to his campaign. After running in a dead heat against Obama for much of the summer, and with his hopes boosted by his selection of Sarah Palin as his running mate, McCain was confronted with a poll showing it could all slip away.</p> <p>The ABC-Washington Post survey, for the first time, gave Obama a clear lead over McCain, with 52% to 43%. Voters, when asked which candidate they trusted to handle the economic crisis, gave Obama an even more commanding lead.</p> <p>McCain needed to take decisive action. He also needed to make a calculation about where he stood on the Wall Street bail-out. Did he want to be seen as the saviour of an unpopular bail-out, or was there more mileage to be had elsewhere?</p> <p>The Arizona senator waited about six hours to return Obama's call. When he did at about 2.30pm, he mentioned that he was thinking of proposing a delay in the debates.</p> <p>Obama admitted later he thought McCain was just \"mulling over the idea\".</p> <p>But within the hour, his opponent popped up in front of the TV cameras in New York to announce that the urgency of reaching a deal on the bail-out compelled him to suspend his campaign and return to Washington. </p> <p>McCain also threatened to pull out of last night's debate.</p> <p>The talk of missing one of the central moments of any election campaign, guaranteed McCain maximum attention. But what unfolded next did not live up to the Republican's claims that he was sacrificing his own political interests to try to nudge Congress towards a deal.</p> <p>Despite his protestations of urgency - McCain cancelled an appearance on the David Letterman show - he found time for an interview on the CBS evening news. He also went ahead with a speech at Bill Clinton's Global Initiative (CGI) summit on Thursday morning. </p> <p>\"I'm an old navy pilot, and I know when a crisis calls for all hands on deck,\" McCain said during the speech to the CGI in New York. \"With so much on the line, for America and the world, the debate that matters most right now is taking place in the Capitol - and I intend to join it.\" </p> <p>Amid the dramatics, Obama's central argument that US voters should have the chance to judge where the candidates stood on the economy went overlooked.</p> <p>\"The times are too serious to put our campaign on hold, or to ignore the full range of issues that the next president will face,\" Obama told the CGI by satellite.</p> <p>By the time McCain arrived in Washington on Thursday, he was still casting himself as the saviour of the bail-out package, even though Pelosi had been telling reporters for hours that the two sides were confident of sealing their agreement by the end of the day. </p> <p>But the House leader should have noted McCain's first port of call - to the footsoldiers of a Republican rebellion. McCain dropped in on a meeting of House Republicans, who were putting together an alternative plan that called for further deregulation of Wall Street.</p> <p>Those Republicans, led by John Boehner, the minority leader, urged McCain to consider a more freemarket-based proposal than the one that was on the table. McCain carried on to the White House, sitting at the opposite end of a long table from Obama. </p> <p>Their behaviour at the meeting was a study in contrasts, according to press accounts. Obama, granted deference by his fellow Democrats, led off the debate.</p> <p>Then Boehner made his move, throwing down a plan that differed wildly from the one under discussion. McCain, asked for his opinion, stayed silent - and that, according to those at the meeting, was taken by his fellow Republicans as a sign of his support for the Republican revolt.</p> <p>Into that silence, Democrats read a political stunt, designed to allow McCain to cast himself as a populist crusader against Wall Street fat cats on the campaign trail.</p> <p>Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who led the negotiations for the House, called McCain's behaviour part of a battle between Bush and his fellow Republicans. \"I didn't think we were going to have to be the referee of an internal GOP [Republican] ideological war,\" he told CBS.</p> <p>Obama's chief strategist, David Axelrod, came to a similar conclusion about McCain's role. \"All that happened was the waters got roiled and we had some political theatre. That's not what we need right now,\" he told MSNBC.</p> <p>But the Republican candidate was unfazed, turning around to accuse his critics of injecting unnecessary theatrics into the crisis talks. \"Americans saw a familiar spectacle in Washington,\" his campaign said in a statement. \"At a moment of crisis that threatened the economic security of American families, Washington played the blame game rather than work together.\"</p> <p>The Republican is evidently looking beyond Washington for a very different reaction to his manoeuvring on the economy, and that verdict will not be known until November 4.</p>",
  "<p>It has been a quick and easy journey, but the village square of Champoluc seems a world away from home. We arrive as the last rays of the afternoon sun are warming the cream and pink stucco of the church tower, and the locals are coming out for the evening passagiato.</p> <p>There's a smell of wood smoke and pine trees. Children play on the steps of the shop beside the church, peering through the windows at the elaborate displays of biscuits and cakes. Though we've barely unpacked, it's already clear that if you want to get away from it all, this is the perfect resort. </p> <p>Champoluc sits at the end of the Val d'Ayas, one of three adjacent valleys that make up the Monterosa ski area. Over the hill from Champoluc is tiny Gressoney-la-Trinit\u00e9, and beyond that is beautiful Alagna, a resort revered for its extreme off-piste terrain. The contrast with the more famous three valleys, the Trois Vall\u00e9es in France, couldn't be greater. Those Trois Vall\u00e9es, comprising Courchevel, M\u00e9ribel and Val Thorens, are Britain's favourite place to ski, attracting 300,000 of us every year. In M\u00e9ribel, which alone gets 150,000 Brits annually (and was founded by a British colonel) it feels as if you can go days without hearing a local voice.</p> <p>But though Turin airport is only a 90-minute drive from Champoluc, few Brits have even heard of Monterosa, let alone visited it, and its villages still feel like authentic Italian farming communities. </p> <p>\"This isn't Chamonix - there are no clubs, no casino, not even a swimming pool, and the most exciting shop in town is the butcher's,\" says Simon Brown, who moved here with his family nine years ago to run Ski2, one of the very few tour operators that brings people to the village. </p> <p>Robin, the photographer, and I stroll off from the village square with the rest of the early evening throng, following the half-frozen stream, past the little open-air ice rink on its banks and the cluster of venerable wood-clad hotels, to the base of the main lift, where a few skiers are toasting their day's exploits in a couple of bars. Anyone seeking wild apr\u00e8s-ski of the dancing in ski-boots on tables variety will be sorely disappointed, but Champoluc oozes laid-back charm. </p> <p>Up on the mountain, the relaxed, small-town vibe persists. The next morning, our first on skis, we find the wide, open pistes are utterly deserted. A couple of the chairlifts are old and slow, but there's no one else around, so never any queues. The only time we see a big group of other people, it turns out to be the ski club from the village school, bombing down in their matching helmets to their parents waiting at the bottom of the slope. We stand on the empty piste, look up at the Matterhorn, and imagine the packed runs of Zermatt, the world-famous resort on the other side of the mountain. </p> <p>But though all of Monterosa's villages are tiny, the ski area they collectively muster is not to be sniffed at - there are a total of 37 lifts and 180km of pistes. It's high and snowsure too - Champoluc sits at 1,580m and the lifts extend to just under 3,000m. Plus Monterosa is one of the best places in Europe to get a taste of heliskiiing. Single day trips are easily booked, cost around \u20ac250, and let you ski high on the Monte Rosa glacier and, if you like, down to Zermatt, off-piste all the way.</p> <p>Lunch takes us even further away from it all. We turn left from the Del Lago piste, and swing through some trees into a little hidden valley. Perched at 2,000m in a clearing below us is Stadel Soussun, an ancient wooden hamlet. There are a couple of old houses, and a tiny chapel big enough for a congregation of four. </p> <p>The hamlet's main house is now a restaurant with rooms (0039 348 6527222, <a href=\"http://www.stadelsoussun.com\">stadelsoussun.com</a>, 80pp per night half-board), and we creak open the heavy wooden door to find a big antique table set and waiting for us. The walls and vaulted ceiling are rough stone and hung with brass pots and old climbers' rucksacks. At one end, a big wooden dresser groans under the weight of red wine bottles. </p> <p>There's no menu, so Stephania, the curly-haired waitress, just reads out what they have. There's steak with juniper berries and goulash, but we opt for Moretti beers and a huge plate of cheese, dried meats and sausage. It's rounded off in proper Italian fashion with shots of homemade genepy, made with the artemisia flower that grows nearby - on the house of course. </p> <p>Upstairs are seven beautiful double rooms in what used to be the grain store. As she shows us around, Stephania explains that the house has always been in the current owner, Sergio's, family. When I ask how old it is, she points to a coat of arms carved into a rafter, alongside the date it was built - 1518. </p> <p>From the piste map it looks as if it's impossible to get back to the slopes from here without a long walk uphill. But, genepy shots downed, the boss fires up his piste basher, we jump in the back, and he drives up a snowy track to the nearest lift.</p> <p>Stadel Soussun is a unique place to stay, but Champoluc is full of good hotels. We're at the comfortable, traditional, Relais des Glaciers (+0125 308 300, <a href=\"http://www.hotelrelaisdesglaciers .com\">hotelrelaisdesglaciers.com</a>); the best in town is the five-star Breithorn (+0125 308 734, <a href=\"http://www.breithornhotel.com\">breithornhotel.com</a>); but those looking for something a bit different should try the Hotel California (+0125 307 977), on the outskirts of the village. As the owner, Guido, shows us around he explains that he's a big fan of rock music from the 60s and 70s, and that his hotel is a tribute to his obsession. A huge Wurlitzer dominates the lobby, and each of the 12 rooms is named after a different singer or group. We check out Bob Dylan, and as Guido proudly flips the light switch, the stereo automatically cranks up: \"How many roads must a man walk down ...\" Each room has music recorded by its namesake, which continues for 90 seconds after you turn on the light. Neat, but it could get annoying, especially if you are just getting up for the loo in the night. </p> <p>We're only here for the weekend, so on Sunday, we head out to explore the rest of Monterosa's three valleys. We sweep down to Gressoney, from where two seemingly endless gondolas take us up to the Passo Salati at 2,971m. From the pass, we peer down towards Alagna, lost in a deep fold in the valley below. </p> <p>Champoluc feels like it's marooned in a gentler age, but if you really want to escape the modern world, come up to this ridge, then traverse right, following the wooden signpost, to the Rifugio Guglielmina (+0163 91444, <a href=\"http://www.rifugioguglielmina.com\">rifugioguglielmina.com</a>, \u20ac50 per night half-board), a refuge clinging to the mountainside at 2,880m. As we arrive, Alberto Calaba, the owner, is making the final preparations for lunch. His family built the place in 1878, although today it's all far slicker, after a major renovation in 2007. There's now heat and light in every room, plus Alberto's pride and joy, the extensive wine cellar, which he drags me behind the bar to see. \"I have 7,000 bottles from Aosta, Piemonte, Tuscany and Sicily - all Italian, of course!\" he says. </p> <p>We may be in a remote setting atop a mountain, but these days the world is a small place. As diners start to take their seats on the large, sun-drenched terrace, many of them stunned to silence by the view, Massimo, one of the waiters, shows me around the bedrooms. He casually mentions that he only moved to this high-altitude outpost a fortnight ago, after 12 years living in Brixton. Talk about getting away from it all ...</p> <p>From the refuges, it's a thigh-busting 1,680m non-stop descent all the way to Alagna. While Champoluc is great for families and fast intermediate cruising, this valley is for the experts. There are only four lifts and a couple of pistes, but the wild mountainside above the village is covered in long, steep, off-piste routes. Whichever one you follow, Alagna doesn't reveal itself until the very last minute but, when you finally come upon it, it's breathtaking, probably the prettiest village in the Alps. Its chalets are made of the most delicious, chocolate-brown wood, aged by the sun over countless summers, and roofed with rough slate tiles. The whole place feels more like a Sherpa village in Nepal than somewhere in Italy. </p> <p>That night, back in Champoluc, we head out after dinner to meet Simon for a quiet drink in the Le Favre bar. A few skiers sit in huddles drinking beer, a few villagers read the paper. Through the window we look past the stream to the church, and the deserted village square. All is quiet. Simon is explaining what happens here in spring. \"Well, the snow melts ... and everyone just goes back to making cheese.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Ski2 (01962 713330, <a href=\"http://www.ski-2.com\">ski-2.com</a>) offers three nights at the Hotel California in Champoluc from \u00a3389pp, or a week from \u00a3630, inc transfers, half-board, plus snack lunches and lift pass but not flights.

  "<p>The Conservatives have made a series of last-minute changes to their party conference, with David Cameron seeking to adopt a sober demeanour in the face of the world financial crisis and Gordon Brown's jibe about the dangers of handing the keys of No 10 to a \"novice\".</p> <p>The Tory leadership has decided to scrap a video celebration of the party's recent string of election victories in the spring and early summer. Cameron will instead lead a discussion from the conference platform tomorrow on how the Tories would \"ease the pain of the downturn\". One shadow minister said: \"It would be inappropriate for David to be triumphant in the current climate. People want us to be serious and offering reassurance.\"</p> <p>The changes to the programme of the Conservative conference, which kicks off in Birmingham today, reflect how the political mood has altered decisively in the last week as President George Bush has tried to broker a rescue package for US banks. Some senior shadow ministers believe that the prime minister judged the mood well when he warned at the Labour conference that it would be the wrong time to send a \"novice\" to Downing Street.</p> <p>Brown's remark, which was also aimed at David Miliband, hit home at one nagging weakness at the top of the Tory party. This is that the Tories' candidate for prime minister - Cameron - is still only 41, while the candidate for chancellor - George Osborne - is only 37.</p> <p>\"David and George are acutely aware of what people say about their age,\" one senior figure said. \"That is why our conference will be grown-up stuff. There will be no schoolyard games.\"</p> <p>The challenge facing Cameron and Osborne was illustrated in an opinion poll which showed that they trail Brown and Alistair Darling over who is best placed to run the economy. The ComRes poll for BBC2's Daily Politics found that 36% of those polled trusted Brown and Darling to run the economy, while 30% trusted Cameron and Osborne.</p> <p>Senior Tories said they were unsurprised by the poll and are wary of other opinion polls giving the party a strong lead over Labour. One source said: \"We have not sealed the deal with the electorate. That does not happen overnight and will not happen immediately after this conference. But we will set to work to show what a difference we would make in government.\"</p> <p>The leadership says it is tweaking the conference programme but not embarking on big changes because Cameron's fundamental approach has, sources say, been vindicated by the recent turmoil on the financial markets. The Tory leader's message boils down to two main points: that Brown has mishandled the public finances and the Tories have been right to set out a fresh agenda which will rely less on a centralising state.</p> <p>Senior Tory sources say the leadership's main challenge is to show that a Tory government would really change the way Britain is governed. The Conservatives will do this by outlining their plans in three priority areas: the economy, the NHS and social policy to fix \"broken Britain\" by improving schools, helping families and reforming welfare. </p> <p>\"The economic and financial crisis shows that it is time for change and not for more of the same,\" one source said. \"A key objective will be nailing the myth that Gordon Brown is economically competent. We will be saying, why should people go for the person who got us into this mess?\"</p> <p>The Tory leadership knows that it will not repeat the success of last year's conference when it scared Brown into abandoning an early election after making populist pledges on inheritance tax and stamp duty. The party will adopt a different approach this year, with Cameron attempting to show he is ready to lead the country in troubled times. A key moment, just as it was last year, will be the speech on Monday by Osborne. The shadow chancellor, who told the Guardian earlier this month that he would be placed in a financial \"straitjacket\", will say that:</p> <p>\u2022 Green taxes are more difficult in the current economic climate. </p> <p>\u2022 A Conservative government may not match Labour's spending plans in the next round after 2011.</p> <p>\u2022 A new fiscal framework will be introduced by a Tory government to ensure that the chancellor cannot be both the architect and judge over rules on spending and taxation.</p>",
  "<h2>I have strayed from my degree, how can I re-engineer my career?</h2> <p>I graduated in 2002 with a first class BEng in mechanical engineering. I didn't become an engineer and now, six years later, I wish I had and am wondering if it's too late. I decided at the time that I didn't want to be an engineer per se but that I'd like to apply my knowledge in some form. I applied for many jobs (graduate trainees for patent law firms, technical publishing, process engineering in the oil industry) and had a few interviews. For whatever reason, I never progressed further. I found it hard to focus on a specific role that interested me and realised I'd been lulled into a false sense of security as to how easy it would be to find a job. </p> <p>As a result, I worked in a small printers for nearly a year until I accidentally found a place on the graduate training scheme for a global PR agency in London. I didn't know what PR was but the job was as a trainee in the agency's technology practice. This seemed to fit my desire for something related to my degree with an element of creativity. </p> <p>I soon realised it wasn't for me - the work was repetitive, not challenging and I didn't fit the role. However, it taught me a lot of valuable lessons. My next job was in communications for a global engineering firm. I enjoyed the role for several years but began to feel pangs of regret for not being on the other side, as an engineer. I began to find out more about all the different roles and what I could have done. Ironically, now that I was in an engineering firm but NOT as an engineer, I began to see the possibilities. I also began to think about travelling, which I hadn't done much of to date. </p> <p>As a result, I moved to Mallorca, Spain and am working as a freelance copywriter. I am again feeling unchallenged and want to make a change. I am passionate about the environment and would love to explore further study, building upon my engineering knowledge, or find work where I can apply my degree - something where I can be of use to society. Is it too late for me to use my degree? Six years is a long time and I really don't remember much of the nitty-gritty of the theory. I enjoyed many elements of the course; most notably the mathematics, materials engineering and fluid mechanics. Money is still an issue, but my work now allows flexibility to earn around studying. Is it too long since I graduated to apply for training courses? Which is the best option and which is more open to me? Study or work? If only I'd known in 2002 what I know now.</p> <p><strong>Jeremy:</strong> There seems to be a sizeable category of people who see the obtaining of a degree not as the necessary introduction to a professional career but as an end in itself; as a self-contained project. It's almost as if the gaining of a degree is just a natural, if rather more challenging, successor to the holiday essay.</p> <p>It sounds to me as if you belong to this category. Otherwise I find it odd that you should have chosen to take a degree in mechanical engineering, worked diligently enough to obtain a first - and then decided not to be an engineer. It's true that a good degree in just about any subject should reassure prospective employers in all sectors that you're both intelligent and conscientious - but it's certainly not a guaranteed passport to utterly unrelated jobs.</p> <p>All this, of course, you now know - and I'm sorry to spell it out so starkly. But I think it's a necessary preamble to working out where you might go next. </p> <p>You've learned a great deal in the last six years and you shouldn't see them as wasted (though I'm a bit bewildered by your sudden swerve to live in Mallorca and take up freelance copywriting: that does seem a bit of an aberration).</p> <p>What you've finally learned (I think) is what you're passionately interested in - and it's not engineering. It's the endlessly fascinating and vastly important subject of the environment. So now you must feed that fascination - and you're surprisingly well-equipped to do so. You have a trained mind that can understand mathematical models and scientific data - and you also have considerable experience of communication. That's a rare combination. I don't think you need further study - I think you should go hell-bent for work. If you can do it from Spain, fine. If not, you'll have to come home. Be utterly relentless in your pursuit of any sniff of an opportunity to work in the environmental field. Don't worry too much initially about money and prospects: start at the bottom and learn on the job. But for the first time in your life you'll be doing something that you're not only intellectually qualified to do but are actually passionate about. And that means you have every chance of doing it extremely well. </p> <h2>I have a good CV, so why am I not getting any interviews?</h2> <p>I have been applying for PA jobs for a year. I have come from a creative and retail background but have improved my Microsoft skills by taking advanced courses. I feel my CV is in good shape yet have only had one interview for a PA role despite applying for jobs nearly every day for the past 12 months. What am I doing wrong? Why am I being ignored?</p> <p><strong> Jeremy:</strong> It could be just chance - it often is. But it's possible that your all-purpose CV, though perfectly professional, doesn't let your own individuality shine through enough. Rather than send off dozens of identical applications in the hope that one of them will strike gold, it's worth giving a lot of thought to each of the companies you're applying to - and then modifying your CV accordingly. Your creative and retail experience and your own out-of-work interests, for example, will be of potential interest to some but not to others. Doing it this way is a lot more time-consuming, certainly: but it should greatly improve your chances of getting to interview stage.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> For Jeremy Bullmore's advice on a work issue, send a brief email to <a href=\"mailto:work@theguardian.com\">work@theguardian.com</a>.

  "<p>The millennium development goals have found plenty of detractors since they were agreed eight years ago. A series of stepping stones supposedly leading to the eradication of chronic poverty by 2015, the targets have not achieved the sort of comprehensive effect once hoped for. There are big success stories in much of Asia, and depressing news of under-achievement from sub-Saharan Africa. But they have at least provided a focus for the international aid effort and a straightforward way of discussing development for the rest of us - thanks not least to the energetic support they have always had from Gordon Brown and have now from the UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon.</p> <p>A high-level development summit - which brought together more than a hundred heads of government on the margins of the UN general assembly - ended this weekend with a timely renewal of commitment, and about $16bn in pledges of aid announced. Experience teaches us that such pledges must be scrutinised closely to see whether they do any more than rebadge existing funds. Assuming they do, ongoing pressure will be needed to ensure these promises are fulfilled - all the more so when recession is eating into good intentions.</p> <p>There are grave charges against the MDGs. They were agreed by the north to be applied in the south, and they are uniform and global. No room here for local variation according to locally agreed priorities, nor even for asymmetrical development - concentrating first on child immunisation, say, while building capacity to meet education targets. It is also said cash is poured into achieving the goals even where there is the ability neither to spend it effectively, nor to monitor reliably where it goes. The hardest question of all is why so little attention is given to economic development, without which the goals may not be achieved and are unlikely to be sustainable. (One NGO estimates that all of sub-Saharan Africa would have to grow at 7% per annum to meet the poverty targets.) Part of the reason why growth was not a target is that aid meant to encourage development has a very uneven history. But when Farm-Africa, one of the Guardian's partners in its Katine project, reports that the MDGs have damaged efforts to improve agriculture - the most basic source of income in the developing world - it is clear that something is not quite right.</p> <p>There is a reluctance to criticise MDGs openly for fear of undermining the effort. Yet the final, and perhaps the gravest, charge is that the huge ambition behind them destined them to fail. Under-performance feeds doubts about whether aid is ever useful, self-serving doubts that could intensify as recession bites. Time to think hard about how to do development better.</p>",
  "<p>The context, as so often, is all. Ordinarily, a nine-point opinion poll lead on the eve of the Tory party conference would be champagne cork-popping news for the Conservatives. And, in one sense, it still is; this morning's Guardian/ICM poll shows David Cameron's party still on course - even after Labour's good week - to form a government at the next general election. But the context makes the lead look suddenly fragile. Last month, the Tory advantage over Labour in our poll was 15 points not today's nine. It was 15 in July too, and it was a huge 20 in June. As a result, the summer political talk has been of a Tory landslide like that of Labour in 1997. In the light of today's poll - which, depending on assumptions made, could produce a small overall Tory majority - that talk suddenly (though perhaps briefly) seems prematurely cocky. The race is tightening, and Labour has rallied, though it is still adrift of its meagre 35% mandate of 2005 and remains far short of the numbers that Gordon Brown was posting in his brief prelapsarian honeymoon a year ago.</p> <p>Still, the poll will send a shiver of apprehension through the Tory high command and will put pressure on Mr Cameron and his lieutenants as they head for Birmingham today. They will take comfort from the poll findings that most voters do not have confidence in Mr Brown to see the country through hard times. They will see an opportunity in the clear majority who think Labour could have done a lot more to protect the British from the continuing global financial turmoil. But they will sense, rightly on the polling evidence, that the public does not seem to have wholly given up on Labour after all. And they will worry that the inevitable downward lurch in economic confidence caused by the banking crisis may yet drive many voters back to Mr Brown, just as the prime minister so clearly intends. The psychological impact of this and other recent polls should not be underestimated. For the first time in several months, the Tories can see Labour in their rear-view mirror.</p> <p>This is good for British politics. And it is good for the Tory party too. Mr Cameron's party has been under too little pressure recently. It has seemed to be coasting towards a large majority that owed more to Labour's inertia and Mr Brown's unpopularity than to anything more positively pro-Tory. The Tory leader is well aware of that danger - like Tony Blair in the mid-1990s he remains personally nervous that his poll lead may prove soft - but until now he has not been under much pressure to do anything about it. Now that is changing. Sooner or later, the Tories would have had to get specific about what they would do in government anyway. But the traumatic financial crisis has been a catalyst for that overdue process. It has changed the acquis of British politics and the Tories must therefore respond. That is why the Birmingham conference will be so significant.</p> <p>The financial turmoil puts the opposition on the spot, as well as Labour. What is the Tory prescription for restoring stability in the banking sector? The public does not know yet. What is the Tory response to the regulatory principles sketched out by Mr Brown and Alastair Darling in Manchester? The public remains in the dark. How will the Tories pay for the extra public debt that Labour has incurred? No public hint there either. Until now, Mr Cameron and George Osborne have been able to make do with uttering generalised lines about the economy, along with the occasional eye-catching move on questions like inheritance tax and non-doms. Another populist coup of some sort - on City bonuses, perhaps - is possible this week. The Tories will also use this conference to try to nail Mr Brown once and for all as the man responsible for swelling public borrowing. But the poll shows the opposition needs to raise its game. What would the Tories do about the collapsing financial system? There is no bigger question for the Tory conference than this.</p>",
  "<p>In a post this morning, I promised more to come on the question of how this bailout debate exposes a fraying of the longstanding Main Street-Wall Street alliance inside the GOP. So here we go.</p> <p>Let me first explain what that is. \"Main Street\" means, in short, the right-wing populist aspects of the current GOP--guns, God and gays, abortion, rallying the decent common folk against the coastal elites, etc. \"Wall Street\" means, literally, Wall Street -- more specifically, the pro-corporatist policies that the party puts in place once voted into office by the people on Main Street: the tax cuts for the wealthy, the stern opposition to almost all regulation and oversight of the private sector, the denial of a human role in climate change (because to acknowledge would imply the need to do something about it, and that means regulations and oversight), a host of policies like that. </p> <p>Get the little people to vote you in. Give them a small tax cut and lots of symbolic stuff that has no actual price tage. Give the store to the big people. That's the Main Street-Wall Street alliance.</p> <p>This bailout proposal puts them at each other's throats far more directly than I can ever remember in my adult lifetime. The decent common folk (almost all white, it should be mentioned) are usually egged on by right-wing populist talk radio jockeys and by politicians to aim their ire at the brown illegals or the homosexuals or the Harvard pointy-heads. Now they're being egged on against the bankers. It's a modern first. And the stakes are fascinating, and high.</p> <p>The always sagacious Mark Schmitt has written <a href=\"http://prospect.org/cs/articles?article=is_the_republican_alliance_finally_breaking\">an interesting take on this</a> at the American Prospect Web site. Why is this happening right now? That is, why are House Republicans rebelling so forcefully? Ideological reasons of course, but ideology is also, it is always to be remembered, driven by structural facts. And the key structural fact, Schmitt writes, is that the House GOP members now almost wholly represent Main Street-style districts:</p> <blockquote> <p>The House Republicans now represent white Americans of modest means -- the very opposite of the \"investor class.\" (Most of the Republicans who represented affluent districts were wiped out in 2006.) They are the ones whose phones are ringing off the hook with opposition to the bailout, the ones already saddled with an unpopular president, an unpopular war, and an uninspiring presidential nominee.</p> <p>Republican strategist Ed Rollins gave the game away on CNN: \"At the end of the day, there's a lot of people thinking about how to rebuild this party, and do we want to rebuild it with John McCain, who's always kind of questionable on the basic facts of fiscal control, all the rest of it, immigration. And I think to a certain extent this 110, 115 members of this study group are saying, here's the time to draw the line in the sand.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>A point very much worth keeping in mind. Senators represents entire states. Some states are small and largely rural. But most individual senators cannot, and the Senate as a body cannot, see itself as the representative of a purely conservative-populist-agrarian politics. America isn't Wyoming. And the affluent districts Schmidt refers to are, as Ruy Teixeira and John Judis (second mention today on Tomasky blog!) <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Emerging-Democratic-Majority-John-Judis/dp/0743254783\">anticipated years ago</a>, shading purple or even blue. So House Republicans are very logically representing the interests of the people, in some ways the <em>only</em> people, who vote for them.</p> <p>Problem: They aren't 51% of the country. Not even close. That's why the GOP needs the Wall Street end of the deal to hold up. But if the House GOP has its way -- and evidently, if John McCain has his way, since he's hitched his star to theirs -- the alliance may crumble. Back to Schmitt:</p> <blockquote> <p>he Republican coalition since at least Reagan has been a miraculous alliance of Wall Street and Main Street. Populist politics, such as the attack on \"elites\" now embodied by the enthusiasm for Gov. Sarah Palin, were the vehicle for Wall Street policies, the very policies that led to the crash. The alliance always seemed unsustainable. At some point it had to break -- you can't go on forever with policies that do nothing for your core constituencies. And now, in the backlash against the bailout, it has broken. The House Republicans see in that backlash an opportunity to, as Rollins says, \"rebuild this party\" on populist, anti-Wall Street grounds.</p> <p>There are only two problems with this tactic. First, the middle of a financial crisis that's about to turn into an economic crisis is a hell of a time to suddenly start listening to your constituents. But that's the problem with playing with populism -- eventually you have to deliver something, and it's likely to be something ugly.</p> <p>The second problem is that the Republicans still have nothing but reflexive Wall Street policies in their bag of tricks. The House Republicans' main alternative? Suspend the capital-gains tax for two years, to encourage banks to unload assets. Brilliant! Except that if these assets had produced capital gains, banks wouldn't be in trouble. But it would still be a nice giveaway for the top one percent. </p> </blockquote> <p>Well said.</p> <p>Final note: Schmitt mentions the great budget battle of 1990 as a spiritual antecedent to what's happening now (see a timeline of that <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE6DC1439F93AA35753C1A966958260\">here</a>).<br>That year's budget deal, in which George H.W. Bush agreed with the Democrats to raise taxes, gave much impetus to a then much smaller group of House conservatives, who used right-populist resentment at the deal, which was cut at Andrews Air Force base (to say those three words in conservative circles to this day makes some people spit on the floor), as a way to build their numbers and eventually take over the House of Representatives four years thence.</p> <p>Their leader, then, was Newt Gingrich. So I was interested to read <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/thecrypt/0908/Is_Newt_still_running_the_show.html?showall\">this</a> in the Politico just this morning:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>If you didn't know any better, you'd think [House Republicans] were taking marching orders from Speaker-in-Exile Newt Gingrich. For the past week or so, he's been urging Congressional Republicans and John McCain to reject the $700 billion bailout and label it the \"Bush-Obama\" plan -- tying the Democratic nominee to the most toxic Republican since, well, Gingrich himself.</p> <p>Opposing the plan would also open up a world of political possibilities for Republicans still tepid about backing Senator Maverick, he's argued.</p> <p>If the GOP blocks the bailout, \"I think you will see the emergence overnight of a 'McCain Reform Wing of the Republican Party' and you'll see House and Senate members siding with McCain by overwhelming margins and then you'll be in a very different political environment,\" he told ABC a few days ago.</p> </blockquote> <p>A few days ago? It seems pretty clear that Gingrich was sketching out to ABC his desired scenario and then whispering in some ears up on Capitol Hill. Nothing wrong with that. Just interesting that a man who left politics in disgrace and drove his political bus over a cliff on the matter of the Clinton impeachment -- and who probably today has an approval rating of no higher than 32% or so -- still carries such weight.</p> <p>The circumstances were right in 1990 for such a nascent right-populist coalition to build. And Gingrich, rhetoric aside, just about always looked out for Wall Street. But whether he's right about that \"world of political possibilities\" today is another question. If the GOP holds onto Main Street and hands Wall Street to the Dems, how are they going to reach 51% (and where are they going to get their donations from?)</p> <p>Last point: If were Obama and David Axelrod, I'd be thinking about ways to tie McCain to Gingrich.</p>",
  "<p>Two streets, separated from each other by seven and a half miles and several billion dollars, but united this week in an iron embrace that will see them either go down together or survive together.</p> <p>To the east is Wall Street, the stretch of imposing masonry in downtown Manhattan that is at the centre of the global financial meltdown. To the west, a hop across the Hudson, is Main Street in Newark, New Jersey, a stretch of clapboard houses and corner shops that is already feeling the cold blast of a downturn.</p> <p>Wall Street was named after the wall built in 1653 to protect the fledgling New Amsterdam settlement against the intrusions of the British. But few remember that now. What began as a defence for the common person was this week cast as the common person's enemy.</p> <p>At least that is how the coalition of New York unions were portraying it at a protest rally against the proposed $700bn bailout. \"Wall Street sucks,\" the crowd chanted outside the forbidding entrance of the New York Stock Exchange.</p> <p>Class war had come to Wall Street. As Arthur Cheliotes, president of the union of New York administrative employees, put it: \"There's a lot of anger among our members. Wall Street is handing us the bill for a party they never invited us to.\"</p> <p>Several traders stood listening during their lunch break from the pandemonium of the trading floor to the bile that was being directed at them. Gary, dressed in a navy blue traders' jacket, was bemused by what he heard. \"We're in a total mess, but I don't see how it's totally our fault. People keep bringing up CEOs and their huge pay - but they are just a tiny part of what goes on here.\"</p> <p>Asked whether he would class himself among the rich, he guffawed. \"If I knew any stock tips I wouldn't be here right now. I'm just like those union members - I work for a living.\"</p> <p>\"They say bail out!\" a union rep burst in as he bellowed at the protesters through loud speakers. \"We say get the Hell out!\"</p> <p>Leonard Bauer, dressed in a standard-issue dark blue suit, told how he and his colleagues from Bank of America were working around the clock on the deal to buy Merrill Lynch. \"It's pretty messy,\" he said. \"The way the markets are going you have to work on everybody - this is not a question of us versus them.\"</p> <p>The don't-blame-us theme was continued by an insurance broker who preferred not to give his name (\"I think it's better not to\".) \"Everyone shares the blame. It's people outside Wall Street who tried to get a house they couldn't afford and a car they couldn't afford. Everyone has to take part of the blame and work together to fix this.\"</p> <p>Though it is fewer than eight miles away, Main Street in Newark is another country. The neighbourhood is so surrounded by railway tracks it is called Ironbound, and has a high concentration of Brazilian immigrant residents with the Brazilian flag flying outside several homes alongside the Stars and Stripes.</p> <p>There is none of the austere grandeur of Wall Street here, nor any of its sense of corporate power and two storeys pass as high-rise here. Despite the contrast, it quickly becomes clear that this Main Street, like Main Streets in small towns across the United States, is umbilically linked to the financial powerhouse to the east.</p> <p>The owner of Betel bakery, that sells pao de queiso, coxinho and other Brazilian pastries and delicacies, trade has been down by about a third since the financial crisis on Wall Street began. Nani Silva, drinking coffee in the bakery, supplies restaurants throughout New Jersey and New York with food and supplies, and she can put a clear figure on the slump.</p> <p>Before the crash her customers used to buy $2,000 dollars' worth of supplies in a single day, now they will spend less than a thousand. \"It's crazy right now,\" she says, adding that if it stays like this for much longer she will think of returning to Brazil which she left four years ago.</p> <p>Further down the street, Marcio Rodgrigues was unaware of the plan for a $700bn bailout until we informed him of it. \"700 billion dollars. Wow!\" was his reaction.</p> <p>He is in the local construction business, and says orders are down by at least a half over the past few weeks, partly as a result of a spate of foreclosures that have swept the area as homeowners have become mired in debt. As we talk, he keeps returning to the figure of $700bn.</p> <p>\"That's a lot of money. They should give that to us, the taxpayers. If they did that we would spend the money, and the depression would be over.</p> <p>Jonatan Silva is a delivery man for a Brazilian hamburger joint at the end of the street. He survives mainly on tips, which is bad news because deliveries are sharply down, and hence his income down too. He, too, has had thoughts of returning to Brazil. But unlike his neighbour, he backs the bailout.</p> <p>\"I think it's cool. If it works it will mean we can work again, construction will start up again, people will order deliveries again and I'll get my tips.\"</p> <p>There's the link. The massive movement of stocks on Wall Street may seem a world away, but here on Main Street they are making all the difference to the dollars and cents of Silva's tips.</p>",

  "<p>Around the ancient and celebrated temples of Bagan, a tour guide blandly dispenses historical nuggets to tourists, his fury hidden beneath a bright smile. Myint Win, a novice monk, is taking a break from his monastery to earn some money in the town whose temples make it one of the country's premier tourist destinations.</p> <p>But times are hard. The protests against the Burmese regime that began a year ago renewed awareness of the tourism boycott of the country, and only the determined make it here these days. In Bagan, few hostels have more than one guest, tour guides say they haven't had a client in months and at the most celebrated temples there is a frantic edge to the hawkers as they plead for custom from the occasional visitor. </p> <p>The irony is not lost on Myint. \"Protesting not good for business,\" he says with a wry smile.</p> <p>In Mandalay, the tourists have vanished. The nightly performance of the Moustache Brothers, Burma's best-known comedians and renowned opponents of the regime, is struggling. Allowed to play only to foreigners, their audiences have dwindled. \"Some nights we cancel,\" says Lu Maw, one of the brothers. \"We can't perform with no audience.\"</p> <p>In the capital, Rangoon, a year after the protests the streets project an eerie impression of normality. Brief chats with those who will risk speaking to a foreigner reveal the fear that conditions everyone's lives. Eyes flick round cafes and voices are lowered before any opinion is expressed. Conversations in taxis or on rickshaws \u2013 anywhere an informer might be listening in \u2013 are studiously avoided. </p> <p>Today, Burma is back to the Orwellian paranoia that has passed for normality here for years, where anger and dissent must be hidden and the daily image of contentment maintained to ensure survival. The regime has tightened its grip, Human Rights Watch reported this week, with the continued arrest and detention of political activists. </p> <p>Myint, the 29-year-old novice monk, first heard about the protests over rising fuel prices at the end of August 2007. Within days, demonstrations had spread across the country to become the largest Burma had seen in decades. A monk in Rangoon phoned Myint. \"He said, you have to help us,\" recalls the novice.</p> <p>And so Myint began to march. In the high plains of Bagan, the sun blazed down on the bareheaded protesters. Walking with thousands of other young, angry men, Myint remembers the glare of the light and his bare feet burning on the hot tarmac. \"The people lined the streets to protect us,\" he says. \"They made sure they were between us and the military and they gave us water. I wasn't afraid because I knew what we were doing was right.\"</p> <p>Then the shooting began. Violating a core principle many believed even the junta must hold sacred, the authorities turned their guns on the monks. The images flooded out: soldiers shooting at unarmed, barefoot protesters, amateur footage smuggled across borders, illicit photos shot on mobile phones flashing around the world. The world reacted with shock; the junta's response was to shut down access to the internet and carry on.</p> <p>There was no shooting in Bagan, but Myint and his colleagues watched satellite pictures of events in Yangon with mounting horror. \"We watched the other marches \u2013 and then the violence. Everyone was shocked. The head of my monastery made the decision to stop the protests.\"</p> <p>Elsewhere, the crackdown was biting hard. Up in Mandalay, as tens of thousands took to the streets of Burma's religious heartland, two middle-aged men watched the monks go by. The authorities knew exactly who they were: Moustache Brothers Par Par Lay and Lu Maw. Three days later they came for Par Par. </p> <p>\"To be honest we had been expecting them. They came at night \u2013 as usual - and said they wanted to ask questions,\" says Lu Maw. \"They held him for just over 30 days.\" \"They kept asking who was organising the protests,\" adds Par Par. \"But I actually wasn't involved this time round, so I couldn't tell them anything.\"</p> <p>By the time the protests had finally been extinguished, more than 4,000 people had been detained, according to Bo Kyi, of the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, an organisation in Thailand that helps political prisoners inside Burma. Many were tortured; monks were forced to disrobe, beaten and some placed in solitary confinement. An unknown number were killed.</p> <p>Those who escaped jail were cowed, and the protest movement evaporated as quickly as it had sprung up. The Burmese people who had dared to hope for real change retreated as the regime reasserted its grip.</p> <p>Four months ago came another devastating blow. In the early hours of May 3, Aung Thin was woken in the small, wooden house she shared with five other family members in her village deep in the Irrawaddy delta by the howl of the wind, then water pouring in. As the water rose, the family scrambled on to the roof. </p> <p>\"We managed to climb into a banyan tree next to our house,\" she says. \"Then the roof began to float and became trapped in the trees. So we climbed back on to it, like a raft. We could see children in the water. My father tried to pull them out but the current was too strong.\" There they clung for hours until day broke and cyclone Nargis, the worst storm to hit the delta in generations, finally passed.</p> <p>Aung tells her story outside the flimsy frame of the new, temporary house her family has built. They were lucky: the storm claimed an estimated 130,000 lives. </p> <p>Their problems are far from over. Four months on, they have a new fear: starvation. The storm swept away not just their harvest but their precious store of rice seeds, ploughing equipment and livestock. It dumped salt water in the paddy fields, rendering them infertile. \"We need to plant,\" says the village chief. \"We have got rid of the salt from fields. We've enough rice to live on for the moment \u2013 just,\" he says. \"But we have to plant.\"</p> <p>The needs could not be more evident, yet the response continues to lag. Money is short; the UN appeal has so far raised less than half of the money needed - $196m of $481m. The critical agriculture sector is just 14% funded. </p> <p>Most cyclone survivors rely on the only support on which they can count: each other. Within days of the cyclone, Myint's fellow monks stepped in to coordinate the delivery of donations across the delta. In Mandalay, Par Par Lay organised donations from the local theatrical scene and drove them in a procession led by a float down to Rangoon. According to the UN, in the first six weeks of the response alone the Burmese people raised a staggering $11m worth of aid. \"In the weeks afterwards, everyone was asking why there hadn't been more secondary deaths,\" says one aid worker in Rangoon. \"The answer is simple: the local response was \u2013 and continues to be \u2013 incredible.\"</p> <p>What happens next? The outlook is grim. There are widespread fears that the failure of the rice harvest will drive up prices of Burma's staple food, and the global credit crunch is biting hard. Black market costs of essentials such as fuel have gone up. Aung San Suu Kyi's house arrest shows no sign of ending. The initial protests may have been triggered by such hardships, but the chances of this happening again are remote. Anger at the inadequacy of the government response to Nargis has deepened the hatred of the junta, but it has not lessened the fear. </p> <p>\"We are still angry,\" says Myint. \"But we bury it here\" \u2013 and he thumps his heart. Myint says the monks are divided: some want more protests, others do not. There has been talk of an armed uprising and a desire for guns, but few see this as a real possibility. \"The monks will never take up arms,\" says Myint. \"Ordinary people, yes. But not the monks.\"</p> <p>A year on, would Myint protest again? It takes him a long time to answer this question as he leans against the warm stones of the ancient temple and looks out across the Bagan plain. In the peaceful light of the late afternoon sun, it is hard to remember the awful realities away from this serene temple plain: the hunger that clutches at Aung and many thousands like her, the suffering of the hundreds still held in Insein and the sheer courage of Par Par Lay, who survived years of hard labour and still will not be silenced. </p> <p>\"I would,\" he says finally, \"but we have no power, only our prayers and our mouths. The government has guns. We must wait and hope. One day, our time will come.\"</p> <p><em>Names have been changed for this article.</em></p>",
  "<p>Of the fissures running through the American left, the deepest, and most impenetrable, is probably trade. Free traders argue that global commerce is the single greatest anti-poverty programme the human race has devised. Fair traders argue that the reality is rather more complicated, and that free trade deals are corporate welfare packages that leave behind economic immiseration, environmental devastation and an impoverished civil sector. </p> <p>On some level, they're both right. It's a complicated issue. But you wouldn't know it from Stuart Townsend's new film, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0850253/\">Battle in Seattle</a>. The movie takes place in Seattle, in 1999, starting a day or two before the <a href=\"http://content.lib.washington.edu/wtoweb/\">protests-turned-riots</a> that Townsend wants to elevate into an iconic instance of civil disobedience. It is, in Townsend's telling, a <a href=\"http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/wto/\">seminal moment</a> in political history. It's just not clear why.</p> <p>The core of the movie is the <a href=\"http://depts.washington.edu/wtohist/\">protesters</a>. But the core of the protesters proves curiously hollow. Martin Henderson plays Jay, the protester-in-chief, whose raison d'\u00eatre seems to be mourning his brother, tragically killed during some sort of forest protest. There's Michelle Rodriguez playing Lou, who's protesting because she's tough, and because she worries that if she doesn't fight, \"they\" will destroy everything that's beautiful about the world. There's Django, played with wit and self-confidence by Outkast frontman Andre Benjamin, who's protesting because his father once told him a story about a turtle. At no point does any character explain the problems with the World Trade Organisation, or detail their vision for a better world or give a reason for their presence that doesn't sound like the sort of thing you'd say to get laid at a protest rally. If Townsend's point was that protest is a form of superficial self-definition rather than an actual engagement with the issues at hand, then, point well made. But I don't think that was his point.</p> <p>There are also characters who are not protesters. Woody Harrelson plays a cop. Actually, more accurately, Harrelson plays a cop playing a metaphor about the necessity of class solidarity. Charlize Theron plays a reporter in a subplot that exists for no reason. Rade Serbedzija plays a representative from Doctors Without Borders who tries to work within the WTO framework and extract more money for drugs, but is foiled by chaos, protesters, lobbyists and traffic. Isaach De Bankol\u00e9 plays Abassi, an African delegate who eventually leads the internal rebellion that shuts the conference down. No one plays a representative from the WTO or any of the participant countries who believes in the mission of the meeting.</p> <p>These stories aren't told so much as gestured toward. The inattention to Abassi's story is particularly galling, as it was his bravery, and that of the African bloc that followed his lead, that actually robbed the conference of the quorum it required to function.<br> After the screening I attended, Townsend said that this failure was due to the lack of information about what actually happened during the WTO meeting. Of course, right after he said that, he noted that he sure wished he'd met Lori Wallach, director of crucial <a href=\"http://www.citizen.org/trade/\">Global Trade Watch</a>, earlier, which suggests that his research methods may not have been quite what one would hope. </p> <p>Because the movie is unable to explain the subject at its heart \u2013 the WTO \u2013 the result is a mash of messages. The heroism of Jay's non-violent protest strategy is repeatedly emphasised, but insofar as the chaos on the streets focuses world attention on Seattle, his style clearly fails. Message: Join up with the anarchists. Abassi's fury at the dismissive treatment given to poorer states is what actually closes down the WTO, but his story is an afterthought. Message: Be an affluent, attractive, American Gen-X type if you want your story to make the silver screen. The city of Seattle is caught off-guard, but the movie explains that future trade meetings lay down miles of barriers between participants and protesters. Message: Invest in long-range artillery?</p> <p>Toward the end of the film, Django and Jay are sitting in jail. Trying to cheer up his friend, Django leans over. \"Look man, a week ago nobody knew what the WTO was!\" Then he considers the statement. \"Actually, they still don't know what it is! But at least they know it's bad.\" Having thus articulated the movie's thesis, they both laugh.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown today called for an end to \"the age of irresponsibility\", apparently handing his Conservative critics a free chance to blame him for his role in creating a culture of greed as chancellor for the past decade. </p> <p>The prime minister's remarks, in a speech to the United Nations general assembly calling for new systems of international regulation of the big global financial players, were immediately seized upon by George Osborne, the shadow chancellor.</p> <p>Brown said: \"This has been an age of global prosperity. It has also been an era of global turbulence and where there has been irresponsibility we must now clearly say the age of irresponsibility must be ended.\" </p> <p>Osborne retorted: \"Gordon Brown has now accurately described his time in office as the 'age of irresponsibility'. For ten years he presided over a debt-fuelled boom and failed to call time on debt. The age of irresponsibility has now become the age of hypocrisy.\"</p> <p>Brown made his remarks before flying to Washington to meet George Bush in the midst of the US president's efforts to persuade a rebellious Congress to give bipartisan support for a $700bn Wall Street bail-out package. </p> <p>The prime minister's presence in Washington at the epicentre of the crisis will help to burnish his credentials as an international financial statesman, even if he can do little to create political consensus in Congress. </p> <p>Brown gave broad support for the package and said he would continue with the British strategy of addressing problems in individual institutions, rather than establishing an over-arching package. </p> <p>The prime minister's official spokesman refused to date when this age of irresponsibility started and said the remarks were a reference to the way in which \"large financial institutions had racked up large liabilities that they were themselves unable to quantify\".<br> Brown insists he has been trying to forge a tighter international regulatory structure for years, but at the weekend Britain was singled out along with the US by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, for long resisting her proposals to control hedge funds and credit rating agencies. As politicians head for cover from the retribution of their electorates, an international game of blame-passing seems already under way. </p> <p>Brown called for a new world order based on transparency and not opacity. He predicted that by the end of the year the 30 largest global finance institutions and banks would each be subject to internationally coordinated monitoring by an international \"college of regulation\". </p> <p>The PM, who has kept in touch with market developments in the UK from the US, said he was not going to intervene in the highly political dispute in Washington on whether to back the $700bn bail-out, but he gave the proposals his broad backing. </p> <p>\"America deserves support from the rest of the world as it seeks to agree in detail what all parties agree in principle,\" he said. </p> <p>In practice, the dispute in Congress seems to have widened so much \u2013 with Republicans calling for an insurance based solution \u2013 that it is hard to argue that there has even been agreement in principle to the package.</p> <p>Brown, setting out his medium-term solutions to the crisis, said: \"Confidence in the future is needed to build confidence today and that confidence will be built by showing that what are global problems can also be addressed by globally coordinated solutions.\" </p> <p>He called for the new international architecture that is being drawn up by the financial stability forum to be built on five principles of transparency, including sound banking practice, responsibility, integrity and global regulation. </p> <p>He argued: \"The international institutions created in the aftermath of world war two have not kept pace with the changing global economy. We need national regulators to be cooperative, rules and principles to be consistent and international movements of capital to be transparent.\" </p> <p>He demanded \"sound banking practice and more effective regulation\" and greater responsibility. \"No member of senior management should be able to say they did not understand the risks they were running and walk away from their obligations,\" he said. </p> <p>Brown is to back a call for a world leaders summit on the financial crisis that is being sought by Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president and holder of the EU presidency. No date has been set for the meeting. </p> <p>Speaking to the UN earlier today, Brown hailed an \"historic summit\" at which another $16bn had been committed to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \"It's demonstrated to the world that in the face of economic challenges we must do more not less to help the poorest of the world,\" he told a press conference last night.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.clintonglobalinitiative.org/\">Clinton Global Initiative</a> sets itself up with an impressive challenge: collecting the most wealthy and powerful world actors to tackle the world's most pressing problems. Among the four issues on this year's agenda is energy and the environment. But a visit to the Wednesday and Thursday morning plenary sessions exposed an underlying timidity in the seemingly bold rhetoric on climate change.<br> While many speakers urged major investments in renewable energy to replace fossil fuels, hardly anyone made even a token nod to reducing energy consumption through efficiency or, heaven forbid, some shared sacrifice.</p> <p>On Wednesday Al Gore lit up an otherwise stultifying panel discussion with his electrifying call for aggressive, immediate action to cut carbon emissions. He threw out fanciful ideas such as building solar panels in Darfur and linking them, via a new electrical grid under the Mediterranean, to the market in Europe. And he called for others to take action, from state attorneys general to young people, who, he said, should be resorting to <a href=\"http://opinion.latimes.com/opinionla/2008/09/gore-coal-civil.html\">civil disobedience</a> to <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/24/gores-call-to-action/?scp=1&amp;sq=%22al%20gore%22&amp;st=cse\">protest the construction of new coal plants</a>. Fitting the American electrical grid for wind and solar power, said Gore, \"should be the number one infrastructure programme\" for whoever is president. A laudable goal, to be sure.<br> Left unsaid, however, which reveals the hole in Gore's argument, was how America's energy demands would be met without those new sources. What about constructing mass transit or denser, greener buildings to reduce energy demands in the first place? It's easy to call for more energy from renewable sources. What's difficult is calling on an audience, especially the jet-setting attendees at CGI, to reduce energy consumption.</p> <p>Gore was no exception in this regard. On Thursday, <a href=\"http://gristmill.grist.org/print/2008/9/25/64519/8576?show_comments=no\">John McCain kicked off the plenary</a> with a speech that included a section on climate change and energy independence. But like Gore he did not approach the question of demand. In fact, he implied that such a thing is impossible, saying: \"Every form of economic activity requires the use of energy.\" Instead he called for the same palette of renewable energy programmes and \"sources yet to be invented\".</p> <p>During the panel, moderator Tom Brokaw repeatedly prodded two of the participants - Shimon Peres, the former Israeli prime minister, and Helle Thorning-Schmidt, leader of the Social Democrats in Denmark - to address the issue of America's extraordinary hunger for energy. But both responded primarily with the same bromides about finding new ways to sate the American public. \"Americans have a great capacity for innovation,\" noted Peres.<br> Gavin Newsom, the mayor of San Francisco, spoke of the need for society to \"take risks and invest in new technologies.\" But for a politician such as Newsom, that is the politically risk-free thing to call for. Saying that Americans should live in smaller homes or drive less would be the true risk.</p> <p>All but one of the half-dozen plenary participants who spoke about climate change avoided uttering the word \"demand\" with regard to energy. Barack Obama was the exception, and even he said only in passing that he would seek to reduce demand, without any specifics about how much or how to do so.<br> To be sure, many speakers called for a carbon tax or cap and trade system that, they hope, will force consumers to reduce consumption by increasing the cost. But at an event devoted to asking its attendees to make financial contributions to solving world problems it was remarkable to see that no one would forthrightly call for them to make sacrifices to address what most of the same speakers would say is the world's greatest problem of all.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown appealed for world leaders to back the idea of an international supervisory body to bring order to the chaotic markets in a speech to the UN general assembly in New York yesterday.</p> <p>He made his appeal, part of a long campaign to win support for more effective regulation of global capitalism, before heading to the political turmoil of Washington and a hastily arranged meeting with the US president, George Bush.</p> <p>Bush yesterday failed to win Congressional support for his $700bn treasury bail-out package and, before meeting Brown, was today desperately phoning senior Republicans in Congress to urge them not to push an alternative package that might delay agreement on the bail-out and send the markets into a frenzy of selling.</p> <p>Brown will be delighted at his access to the president just as Washington becomes the epicentre of the financial storm, as it will help build his image as the key dealmaker with experience in crisis management.</p> <p>But both Brown and Bush will be desperately worried by the initial reaction of the markets to the failure of US Congressmen to reach agreement on the bailout promoted by the US treasury secretary, Henry Paulson.</p> <p>Brown is in principle supporting the plan to buy the so-called toxic assets without endorsing controversial details, such as whether there should also be a cap on executive compensation or tighter Congressional oversight of the package's costs.</p> <p>Some Republicans are busy promoting an alternative package based on a government-sponsored insurance scheme for mortgage-backed securities, which they believe would require less use of less taxpayers' money.</p> <p>In New York, Brown has won political support for his long-term solutions from the European commission president, Jos\u00e9 Barroso, and the Australian prime minister, Kevin Rudd.</p> <p>In a speech to the UN after seeing Brown, Rudd backed the idea of tighter international regulation based in the IMF and said he would push the scheme at the G20 forum.</p> <p>The scheme is being promoted in greater detail by the Financial Stability Forum, comprising treasuries, central banks and supervisors in the big financial centres.</p> <p>Rudd said the big firms should be required to build up capital during good economic periods and the licensing of large firms should be conditional on the disclosure of company figures.</p> <p>\"The global financial crisis is a call for the global community to act,\" Rudd said.</p> <p>The Americans are aware the internal regulatory structure is outdated, and the US treasury put forward proposals for internal reform in March last year, but they have not yet embraced Brown's heavy faith in a new international forum.</p> <p>As an incumbent, and in some ways architect of the British supervisory structure, Brown is aware he could suffer a political backlash if blame for the crisis sticks to him, rather than the lack of regulatory oversight in the US.</p> <p>As Britain starts to reap the whirlwind in the crisis, Brown insists he has never been a defender of the status quo but always been an active, but thwarted reformer.</p> <p>In an ominous sign at the weekend, the German chancellor Angela Merkel disagreed and singled out the US and Britain for resisting her proposals for tighter regulation of hedge funds and credit rating agencies during her presidency of the G8 group of industrialised nations two years ago.</p> <p>\"We got things moving, but we didn't get enough support, especially in the United States and Britain,\" Merkel said on Saturday. Her remarks are an embarrassment to Brown, and reflect a determination in some European capitals to attack Anglo-Saxon principles of capitalism.</p> <p>Merkel expanded on her point in a speech in Austria, suggesting both Washington and London were only now coming around to her view.</p> <p>\"It was said for a long time 'let the markets take care of themselves' and that there is 'no need for more transparency'.</p> <p>\"Today we are a step further because even America and Britain are saying 'Yes, we need more transparency, we need better standards for the ratings agencies'.\"</p> <p>The German finance minister, Peer Steinbrueck, also on Wall Street this week, said he detected a new mood ensure to more transparency on international finance markets and, secondly, to demonstrate more sensitivity to risk.</p> <p>The French president, Nicholas Sarkozy, in language more reminiscent of the Labour left at its Manchester conference, claimed laissez-faire capitalism is dead, and called for executives to be fined criminally for their irresponsible actions in creating junk assets based on the newspaper.</p> <p>He also wants the world's major industrial powers to convene at a special summit before the end of the year and start to construct, from scratch, a new financial and monetary framework, which would replace the US-dominated system set up at Bretton Woods in 1944.</p> <p>Brown has spoken to Sarkozy on this but would prefer to work through the IMF and G7 finance ministers, both due to meet in Washington next month.</p> <p>But Sarkozy is building to make the crisis a wider struggle between Euope and the US, a struggle in which Britain could be caught as an awkward bridge, as it was during the Iraq war.</p> <p>Sarkozy has warned the US-inspired lack of regulation in recent years, he added, \"was a folly whose price is being paid today\".</p> <p>\"Self-regulation to solve all problems, it's finished,\" Sarkozy said. \"Laissez-faire, it's finished. The all-powerful market that is always right, it's finished.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Brooklyn. <br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Will Roan (vocals), Simon O'Connor (guitar), plus a rotating cast of thousands, well, tens. Actually, seven at last count. <br> <strong>The background:</strong> Most \"movements\" gain attention because of one genuinely great band while the rest hang on their coattails. But that's not true of the current scene based around acts operating in the Brooklyn area who met earlier this decade at liberal arts college Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut. MGMT may have been the first out of the traps, the first to gain global renown \u2013 and it was us who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/nov/09/popandrock3\">told you about them first</a>, folks, up here at New Band of the Day \u2013 but they're by no means the only Wesleyan alumni worth getting into a tizz over. There's the effortlessly cool punk-disco of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jul/28/boy.crisis\">Boy Crisis</a> and the ambient folktronica meets latterday power balladry of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/sep/03/new.band.of.the.day.382.chairlift?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=music\">Chairlift</a>. Last but by no means least are Amazing Baby, who are amazing, baby, but who hadn't even formed when we unleashed MGMT on an unsuspecting world way back in the mists of time, in November 2007. <br> No, they didn't get together until January 1, 2008, when Will Roan and Simon O'Connor, the core duo and creative masterminds of Amazing Baby, decided that it might be a nice idea to form a group capable of being simultaneously epic and anthemic yet with a richly detailed sound that could incorporate psych, folk, prog, funk and pop elements without it being a horrible mish-mash of opposites. They love the studio whizkiddery and sonic trickery of Brian Eno and Lindsay Buckingham - look out for the multi-tracking and overdubbing, reverb and echo - as well as the choral majesty of Queen even if, live, they can't hope to approximate the lush intricacy of their recordings and so go instead for a stripped-down rawk attack. Without a doubt, it could have been sprawling and inchoate but somehow all the elements cohere quite beautifully. In fact, they've created an organic new hybrid, and now we just need a name for it. Choral stadium folk-metal? Too unwieldy. Prunkadelia?! Do send in suggestions.  Meanwhile, let's meet the players: Roan is the enigmatic shaman \u2013 the Andrew Vanwyngarden of the piece \u2013 who, it has been said, \"prowls the front of stage like a pre-pipe'n'slippers Richard Ashcroft\", while O'Connor, who was in a porn-rock band with those MGMT boys at college called Misogynistic Pineapple, has been said to resemble \"a Faith No More-loving metal-head who wandered into the wrong audition by mistake\". An odd couple, perhaps, but these acid-loving hippie throwbacks (on their MySpace the cheeky scamps say they're signed to a tiny imprint called Psilocybe but actually they're about to ink a deal with a major) have charismatazz by the bucketload. They did their first photo shoot naked, they talk about cosmic dentists, they'd like to play a gig inside a medieval volcano while on their website, under the heading \"About Amazing Baby\", there is a photograph of a mushroom cloud after an atomic blast. Like, heavy, man.  But they're no space cadets. They know what they're doing. Having made available their self-produced Invisible Fucking Cross EP via their website earlier this year, the band make their first trip to the UK in November supporting MGMT before starting work on their debut album with Claudius (Muse, Interpol) Mittendorfer. If it includes some of the tracks on their MySpace \u2013 the celestial bliss-rock of Head Dress, and The Narwhal, which sounds like T Rex on the moon \u2013 it will be something very special indeed. <strong>The buzz:</strong> \"These Brooklyn scenesters pile layers of noisy, cascading guitars onto an 'aohw aohw' chorus like wayward glam refugees munching 'shrooms.\"</p> <p><strong>The truth:</strong> We don't want to be accused of hype and turning Wesleyan into the Noughties version of Swinging London or Madchester, but this makes four great bands on the trot. Out of one college.

  "<p>The unpredictably unfolding global financial crisis is shaking the fundaments of the prevailing economic orthodoxy. Even though the newspaper headlines are currently focusing on the troubles of individual companies and political responses to their decline, Bears Stearns, HBOS and Lehmann Brothers cannot obscure the fact that there is a deep-seated systematic failure at the core of this crisis. </p> <p>If the latest <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/26/wallstreet.marketturmoil1\">US government rescue package</a> is passed by Congress, the Bush administration will have provided almost $1tn for the acquisition of bad debts and the bail-out of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/interactive/2008/sep/09/ushousing\">Freddie Mac, Fanny Mae</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/18/wallstreet.georgebush\">AIG</a> alone. Even more unusual than this unprecedented state intervention in the financial markets was the upbeat reaction by Wall Street to one of the biggest nationalisation waves in US history \u2013 an unambiguous sign that the system has truly failed.</p> <p>From a citizens' point of view, it is also quite clear what this extraordinary state intervention amounts to: after years of huge privatised profits and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/23/alistairdarling.executivesalaries\">large bonuses</a> rewarding short-term risk-taking, the losses and insecurities resulting from unsustainable business practices are now socialised with the taxpayer effectively taking over the risk. And there is little else governments can do as inaction would cause even bigger earthquakes in the financial sector and without a doubt have an even more disastrous impact on businesses and households. You simply have to keep the financial heartbeat going if you want to keep your economy in motion.</p> <p>As a political reaction to the global financial meltdown, there is widespread agreement that the regulatory framework needs to be remodelled to prevent a similar disaster from happening again. It is a pity that the worst case had to materialise before sufficient political awareness could be created. But given the wide-ranging socialisation of financial risks, not just the rulebook but also the issue of taxation should be reconsidered. </p> <p>If the taxpayer's money is used to secure the risks financial industries produced, financial institutions should vice versa contribute more than previously to the provision of public goods and welfare systems, which are there to insure individual citizens against life risks. </p> <p>In the past, financial institutions have been particularly creative in avoiding adequate levels of taxation. Against the backdrop of the current situation, this needs to change. As taxation structures are very complex and dissimilar in different countries, the probably best \u2013 but still not easy \u2013 way to introduce a comprehensively applied new system of taxation would be the introduction of some form of transaction tax. </p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.justiceplus.org/tobin_tax.htm\">Tobin tax</a> in particular should be considered. Such a levy would tax currency conversions in foreign exchange markets and would thus set disincentives for short-term speculation. And given that the quickly rising daily turnover in these markets is currently $3.2tn, even a small tax rate of 0.05% could create revenues of about $400bn a year. This money could be partially used to fund badly needed international governance structures and \u2013 as indicated above \u2013 allocated to nation states to help insure individual citizens from life risks. </p> <p>There are of course also major problems that make the implementation of a Tobin tax quite difficult. What exactly should the tax base be? What transactions would be taxable and at what rate? How exactly would the revenues be distributed? But regardless of these issues, the current political climate seems right to give this sort of taxation a new push. After all, on what basis could financial institutions complain about a low level of new taxation given the huge sums of money the ordinary taxpayer has to provide now to bail them out of their homemade crisis? </p> <p>Civil society is the insurer of last resort for financial markets. A remodelled regulatory framework should acknowledge this fact and make sure that there is also a degree of responsibility in the opposite direction. A modest level of new taxation would ensure that financial institutions contribute to society more adequately during boom times and not only rely on the taxpayer to bail them out when they go bust.</p>",
  "<p>The Bank of England's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/26/wallstreet.banking\">emergency operations </a>today are an attempt to unfreeze money markets that are paralysed by fears that the $700bn (\u00a3380bn) mortgage bail-out plan in the US will fail to win political backing.</p> <p>To the high street banks, the operations are a significant move. The Bank of England is trying to help generate lending between banks in \"longer-term\" markets - where banks lend money to each other for periods of one month and three months - rather than focusing on the shorter-term overnight and one week money markets.</p> <p>The high street banks have been pleading with the Bank of England to inject more liquidity into the markets and follow the example of the European Central Bank and Federal Reserve, which are perceived to have been more effective in their operations.</p> <p>The Bank is injecting \u00a340bn of three month-funds in to the money markets and switching most of the money it was offering to overnight funds to one week. It said it was trying to \"address funding pressures over quarter end\".</p> <p>The Bank is also responding to the high street banks which had asked to be able to use a wider range of collateral, including mortgage-backed securities.</p> <p>The move was welcomed by Stuart Gulliver, chief executive of Global Banking and Markets at HSBC. He said: \"It's what the market was looking for. It shows a willingness to listen and will alleviate stresses in the UK bank system right through year-end.\" </p> <p>Another senior banker said: \"This is what the bankers have been lobbying for for quite a while. It will relieve the pressure in the overnight money markets and the fact that the funding is for longer terms is particularly welcome\".</p> <p>While the Bank of England's money market operations appear arcane to those outside the specialist field, the rate at which banks lend to each other affects the price at which they in turn charge consumers for mortgages and other home loans.</p>",

It's high time that we have top Christian businessmen, businesswomen, bankers, you know, who are men and women of integrity running the economics of our nations,\" he said, his remarks captured in recently unearthed video footage. Then he continued: \"If you look at the \u2013 you know \u2013 if you look at the Israelites, that's how they work. And that's how they are, even today.\"<br> It's seems pretty clear that Muthee was alluding to Jewish control over global finance. But if Sarah Palin objected, she certainly didn't show it when, a few minutes later, she joined him on stage. There, as she bowed her head and turned her palms toward heaven, Muthee laid hands on her and beseeched God to pump money into her gubernatorial campaign coffers. \"Bring finances her way, even for the campaign, in the name of Jesus,\" he prayed. Earlier this year, speaking at the church, <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gvCzZ0SoitdKvCm5L-qbcB6KSGUQD93DIUQ80\">Palin gave Muthee part of the credit</a> for her victory. \"He said, 'Lord, make a way, and let her do this next step,' and that's exactly what happened. Again, very, very powerful coming from this church, so that was awesome,\" she said.<br> We've seen, in this surreal campaign season, a surfeit of problematic preachers, raising questions of how much responsibility politicians have for their religious consorts. Barack Obama continues to be excoriated for his long association with the Rev Jeremiah Wright, whose <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/14/AR2008011402083.html\">connections to Louis Farrakhan</a> are being used to frighten some Jewish voters. Yet Obama never had any direct relationship with Farrakhan, nor did he ever join Wright onstage during one of his inflammatory sermons. There is nothing in Obama's history to suggest any tolerance for, let alone comfort with, anti-Semitism. It is not clear that the same could be said for Palin.<br> Politicians are not accountable for everything said in their presence, or everything uttered by their supporters. If Muthee's comments were the only time Palin appeared to condone anti-Jewish language, it would probably be fair to overlook it. Palin is not, after all, a terribly worldly woman, and it is possible that Muthee's Protocols of the Elders of Zion reference went right over her head.  But this incident was not unique. When Palin <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/03/us/politics/03wasilla.html?pagewanted=all\">ran for governor against incumbent Republican John Stein</a> in 1996, her supporters argued that Wasilla needed a \"Christian\" mayor. \"My background is Lutheran,\" said Stein. \"Does this mean that people think I'm not a Christian?\" It did indeed. Some of Palin's backers may have just been suggesting that Stein wasn't a real Christian, but as I learned when I visited Wasilla earlier this month, there was also a rumour that he was Jewish.<br> Palin isn't overtly hostile to Jews, of course \u2013 indeed, one of her daughter Bristol's best friends comes from one of Wasilla's few Jewish families. Yet the religious milieu that shaped her is, at the very least, more anti-Jewish than the one that nurtured Obama. Less than two weeks before Palin was chosen as John McCain's running mate, she <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/sep/04/uselections2008.sarahpalin3\">sat in the congregation at Wasilla Bible Church</a> as David Brickner, executive director of Jews for Jesus, suggested that violence in Israel was part of God's judgment on non-Christians. \"But what we see in Israel,\" he said, \"the conflict that is spilled out throughout the Middle East ... is an ongoing reflection of the fact that there is judgment. \u2026 When Jesus was standing in the temple, he spoke that that judgment was coming, that there's a reality to the judgment of unbelief.\"<br> Can we attribute Brickner's views to Palin? Of course not. We can, however, conclude that they are not uncommon in Palin's church. While in Wasilla, I <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/doc/20081013/goldberg\">interviewed Curt Menard</a>, a local politician who is very close to Palin. She was a classmate and close friend of Menard's late son, who, before he died in a 2001 plane crash, was the godfather of Palin's son Track. His wife, Linda, the former director of the Miss Wasilla pageant, recruited Palin into beauty contests, and the couple is currently caring for Palin's dog. Like Palin, they attend Wasilla Bible Church, and I asked Menard about whether we could determine anything about Palin's stance on the Middle East from her religion. He immediately started talking about Brickner. \"He spoke on Jews for Jesus, and I think in his opinion \u2026 the fact that a lot of the problems and issues that Israel has in the world, is because they haven't accepted Christianity,\" said Menard. He couldn't say whether Palin shares such views, but he said they were not controversial among the congregation.<br> Imagine, for a moment, that Obama had a similar record. Imagine that he joined a preacher onstage right after that preacher had spoken about \"Israelite\" control of the financial sector. Imagine that he had won his first local election against a man with a Jewish-sounding last name amid suggestions that his opponent wasn't really a Christian. Imagine that he had sat in church this summer and listened without protest to a sermon blaming Israel's agonies on the country's adherence to Judaism. All this would likely have resulted in something near hysteria among both the professional media and the demagogues of talk radio.  Yet on Palin, the self-appointed defenders of American Jewry have been fairly quiet. That's because, when it comes to the chosen people, those on the left are held to very different standards than those on the right. Palin, like many right-wing evangelicals, is wildly hawkish on Israel, and in American politics, that's seen as synonymous with friendliness toward the Jewish people. Yet as Pat Robertson and many others have proven, promoting antisemitic conspiracy theories is not incompatible with fanatical Zionism. Palin would, in all likelihood, be an ally of that messianic fringe of the Jewish community determined to thwart any possibility of peace with the Middle East. That doesn't mean her candidacy shouldn't give other American Jews real reason to worry.</p>",

Or, in fact, the<a href=\"http://www.snowbone.com/\"> Snowbone</a>. Hmm. A snowboard with handles, yeah, but still a snowboard. </p> <p>The Smiles Per Hour competition, sponsored by Fiat to the tune of a lot of money (the prize was \u00a350,000!) asked designers to come up with a way of getting from A to B: they came up with all sorts of lovely design-studenty types of ideas such as bicycle/row-boat hybrids, <a href=\"http://www.fiat.co.uk/Community/blogs/smiles/archive/2008/08/15/hylo-female-commuter-shoe-by-natalie-daghestani.aspx\">flat shoes that turn into high heels</a> (very clever, this, actually), or three-wheeler pedal powered vehicles. </p> <p>Personally I think the judges missed a trick by not handing the prize to <a href=\"http://www.spongdesigns.com/\">Steven Spong</a>, whose delicious looking Longbow skateboard allows the skateboardee to power along by pumping up and down on the board. It's a lovely bit of kit, and as someone who is regularly nearly run over by skateboarders (my home is on a ratrun to a nearby skateboard park, tsk) I've noticed how many young folk increasingly use these things to get around. </p> <p>Instead, however, the judges picked Nick Rawcliffe's Snowbone. It's a beautiful thing, don't get me wrong, but with climate change in the 'pending' tray, you think you'd pick something a little less weather-dependent. Give him a chance though. I suppose none of us really know which way the Gulf Stream's gonna jump.</p> <p>There is a more serious issue here, obviously, and I'm impressed to see a car company raising it. It's easy to get distracted by collapsing banks and presidential debates from the slightly dull reality of trying to find a way out of our car dependency. But while we wring our hands about carbon markets and the Kyoto agreement, action needs to be being taken on the ground too: you can't really reduce carbon dioxide emissions, unless you, well, reduce carbon dioxide emissions. </p> <p>In fact, although it's not all good news, some genuine progress is being made in getting people back out of their cars, here in the UK. A couple of years ago the government initiated the <a href=\"http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/sustainable/demonstrationtowns/sustainabletraveldemonstrati5772\">Sustainable Travel Towns</a> idea, and picked Darlington, Worcester and Peterborough for pilot projects. </p> <p>The local councils were given a bit of money, and began doing things like sending officers round to people's houses and giving them personalised travel plans, or into schools to talk to the pupils about getting on their bikes. </p> <p>The results have been really impressive. In Darlington for example, between 2004-7 (they're waiting for the most recent figures) car use has gone down by 9%, walking has gone up by 11% and cycling by 65%. It's financially successful too: the council officer I spoke to said that the cost of knocking on doors \"is much lower than building a road\". And that is clearly true. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/jun/20/travelandtransport.ethicalliving\">Bicycle Towns</a> pilot projects are also starting to get results, and Bristol has just been chosen as the country's first Bicycle City. According to<a href=\"http://www.bettertransport.org.uk/\"> Campaign for Better Transport</a>, while cycling figures aren't exactly soaring upwards, they've now stopped plummeting downwards. Which is better than nothing. </p> <p>So, although car manufacturers continue to search for clever solutions to the carbon dioxide problem, perhaps the transport of the future is actually the transport of the past: the bicycle wheel or even our feet. Or perhaps I am, as usual, completely wrong, and by Christmas 2009 we'll all be snowboarding to work. What do you think?</p>",
  "<h2>On Brown's comments about Conservative economic policy</h2> <p>\"I think it is so important that we recognise that the prime minister in his conference speech, speaking about a really important subject, this enormous crisis we face, said the Conservatives opposed the stops on short selling, which is completely untrue. He said that the Conservatives wanted to abolish regulation of the mortgage market, completely untrue, and then had the gall to read out half a quote and pretend that George [Osborne, the shadow chancellor] had said something completely different.</p> <p>\"You know, you have got to judge people in politics by how they behave and what they do and, in my view and I would have thought in most people's view, that is completely unacceptable behaviour.\"</p> <h2>On being called a \"novice\" by Brown</h2> <p>Cameron said that during his three years leading the Conservatives he had managed make a number of changes, including on women candidates and the environment, which people said could not be achieved.</p> <h2>On Brown's claim to be the person with the \"experience\" to lead Britain</h2> <p>\"Yes, this prime minister has got experience; he has got the experience of building up the biggest budget deficit of any industrialised country, he has got the experience of designing the regulatory system that failed to prevent the first run on a bank in Britain in 150 years.</p> <p>\"He has got the experience of saying year after year 'I have ended boom and bust'. And yet now we face really difficult economic circumstances. Now, I don't think that is the experience we need right now.</p> <p>\"I would say you would have to judge people on what their policies are, what their approach is and whether they can understand what you are going through and do something about it, and I think [from] the policies I have set out, the approach we have set out, people can see that.</p> <p>\"I just make this argument: who in the last year has thumped the poor and the working poor with abolishing the 10-pence tax rate? That was an appalling decision taken by a Labour prime minister.\"</p> <h2>On exposing his family to the media \u2013 a trait which Brown attacked in his conference speech</h2> <p>Cameron said he was right to show off his family in the media as it was \"the biggest thing in my life\" and would help because he was asking the British people to \"put their trust in me to make me their next prime minister\".</p> <h2>On foreign policy</h2> <p>Asked what his top three foreign policy priorities would be, Cameron replied: \"Afghanistan, Afghanistan, Afghanistan.\"</p> <p>He said that if Britain failed in Afghanistan, the terrorist training camps would return under the Taliban and there would be more terrorism in the UK.</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron today said that the Conservatives would use their conference next week to show how different they were from the \"divided\" Labour party that was obsessed with its own divisions.</p> <p>In a video message to his party released on its <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/sep/26/digitalmedia.media\">redesigned website today,</a> the Conservative leader said there would be a \"big contrast\" between his conference in Birmingham and the Labour one in Manchester.</p> <p>Cameron also confirmed that that Tories have changed their conference schedule because of the seriousness of the crisis affecting the world economy.</p> <p>In an interview being broadcast on Sky tonight, Cameron accuses Gordon Brown of making comments about Conservative party policy that were totally untrue. He said this was \"completely unacceptable behaviour\" for a prime minister.</p> <p>In his video message Cameron said: \"There's going to be a big contrast between last week, where the Labour party was talking about themselves, how do they get out of the mess they're in, talking about their leadership and talking about their divisions, and our conference, which is going to be about what we want to do to help our country.\"</p> <p>Cameron said the conference would take place at a time of \"incredible financial turmoil\". The party had planned to open the conference on Sunday with a session celebrating its recent election successes, but instead there will be a discussion about the global economy.</p> <p>The Conservative leader said the theme for the conference would be \"Plan for Change\". The same slogan has been used by Barack Obama, the US Democratic candidate for president, in recent weeks.</p> <p>The conference is an important one for the Tories because it will be the first since 1997 when shadow ministers will be discussing policies knowing that they have a good chance of implementing them in office.</p> <p>But Cameron wants to avoid a tone of complacency.</p> <p>In an article written for the House Magazine, Cameron said: \"The phrase 'Go back to your constituencies and prepare for government' won't be used. We are not arrogant enough to be complacent. This is about making sensible preparations for the possibility that we will soon be in a position to implement our policies in government.\"</p> <p>In the wide-ranging Sky interview, Cameron said that Brown's \"experience\" showed why he should not remain prime minister, revealed that Afghanistan would be his foreign policy priority and defended his decision to be photographed with his children.</p> <p>Alan Duncan, the shadow business secretary, told the Financial Times today the mood of conference would be \"sober, responsible, determined\".</p> <p>He told the FT: \"Being in government is going to be fraught with difficulty because we're going to be there picking up the mess and it's difficult to be popular when you're picking up the mess.\"</p>",
  "<p>I serve on the <a href=\"http://budget.senate.gov/democratic/aboutsbc.html\">budget committee</a> in the US Senate, and prior to that served as a member of the banking committee of the House of Representatives. For the past seven years I have heard President George Bush and his administration tell us how \"robust\" the American economy was, and how all of its \"fundamentals\" were <a href=\"http://www.swamppolitics.com/news/politics/blog/2007/08/bush_fundamentals_of_our_econo.html\">strong</a>. <br> That was until <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/09/19/business/main4459685.shtml\">a few days ago</a>. Now, suddenly, the American Congress \u2013 and the American nation \u2013 are being told that if Congress does not act immediately and approve a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/25/business/economy/25paulson.html\">$700bn Wall Street bailout proposal</a> that the Bush \"free marketeers\" have written up, there will be an unprecedented economic meltdown in the United States and an unraveling of the global economy. </p> <p>This proposal as presented is an unacceptable attempt to force the middle-income families of the United States to pick up the cost of fixing the horrendous economic mess that is the product of the Bush administration's deregulatory fever and Wall Street's insatiable greed. If the potential danger to the American economy was not so dire, this blatant effort to essentially transfer $700bn up the income ladder to those at the top would be laughable. </p> <p>Let me be clear. If the economy is on the edge of collapse, we need to act. But rescuing the American economy does not mean we have to just give away $700bn of taxpayer money to the banks. Unlike the Bush administration, I believe any proposal must protect middle-income and working families from bearing the burden of this bail-out. We must not redistribute wealth upward, to the financial houses and banks and the wealthy investors who control them.</p> <p>I have proposed to my colleagues in the US Senate a four-part plan to fund responsibly whatever bail-out is necessary.</p> <p>The first part is a progressive and reasonable distribution of fiscal responsibility: a five-year, 10% surtax on the income of individuals above $500,000 a year, and $1m a year for couples; a requirement that the price the government pays for any mortgage assets are discounted appropriately so that government can recover the amount it paid for them; and, finally, a programme to enable the US government to receive equity in the companies it bails out so that when the stock of these companies rises after the bailout, taxpayers have the opportunity to share in the resulting windfall. Taken together, these measures will provide the best guarantee that at the end of five years, the government will have gotten back the money it puts into the bail-out. </p> <p>Second, in addition to protecting the average American from being saddled with the cost, any serious proposal has to include reforms so that we end the type of behaviour that led to this crisis in the first place, a crisis that has endangered not only the American economy but the world economy. Much of what has gone wrong in the US can be traced to specific legislation that broke down regulatory safety walls in the financial sector, allowing banks and others to engage in new types of risky transactions that are at the heart of this crisis. That era of deregulation needs to be ended. Wall Street has shown it cannot be trusted to police itself. America needs to reinstate a strong regulatory system that protects our economy, and the economies of other nations that invest in American financial instruments.</p> <p>Third, the US needs to adopt some of the worker-oriented priorities of other nations so that it can address the needs of working families in our nation who are today facing very difficult times \u2013 and not just bankers and their partners in fiscal speculation. If we can bail out Wall Street, we need to respond with equal vigour to the plight of American workers and their families. That means, for example, creating millions of jobs through major investments in rebuilding the crumbling infrastructure of the US and in creating a new renewable energy system to address global warming. We must also make certain that we protect more than banks: we must make sure the most vulnerable Americans don't freeze in the winter or die because they lack access to primary healthcare. </p> <p>Finally, we need to protect the international financial system from being at the mercy of giant companies that are \"too big to fail,\" companies which are so large that their failure would cause systemic harm to either the American or the world economy. We need to assess which companies fall into this category and insist they are broken up. Otherwise, the American taxpayer will continue to be on the financial hook for the risky behaviour, the mismanagement, and even the illegal conduct of these companies' executives. Likewise, those who work in economies interlinked with the US economy \u2013 which in our 21st century global economy is every nation \u2013 must be protected from disruption because of irresponsible or wrong decisions by corporate executives in a place far from their own.</p> <p>These are the last days of the Bush administration, the most dishonest and incompetent presidency in modern American history. I believe that is imperative that, at this important moment, the US Congress stand up for the American middle class and for fiscal integrity. The future of the United States, and that of the global economy, is at stake.</p>",

Any takeover of ITV looks dead in the water, Sky could miss its target of 10 million subscribers by 2010 - even internet advertising has been hit.</p> <p>How astonishing, then, to look back to 2003, when Merrill Lynch - at that time still a revered financial titan - produced a report of the best performing media shares in Europe: Johnston Press ranked second, now-beleaguered Trinity Mirror came in third, with Daily Mail &amp; General Trust 12th.</p> <p>DMGT's share price fell 10% yesterday when it said full-year profits would be at the bottom end of analyst predictions. Its regional newspaper operation, Northcliffe Media, suffered a 24% year-on-year decline in ad revenue in September.</p> <p>Chairman Lord Rothermere said that the events of recent weeks - such as the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the bail out of AIG and the sale of Merrill Lynch - would not have a \"material impact\" on DMGT's full-year performance.</p> <h2>Consumer confidence</h2> <br>But others gave warning. \"The recent financial events may not specifically hit media companies now, but anything that undermines investor or, more importantly, consumer confidence is negative for advertising,\" said Alex de Groote, a media analyst at Panmure Gordon. <p>De Groote is clear that analysts will roll out another series of downgrades on media stocks, as they did in July. Numis Securities has just shaved 10% off its pre-tax profit forecast for DMGT next year from \u00a3266m to \u00a3240m.</p> <p>He argues that any company with a serious exposure to advertising, accounting for more than 50% of total revenue, could face a \"horror show\" in 2009.</p> <h2>'Right-sizing' cost bases</h2> <br>Advertising-dependent Channel 4 has just announced 150 job cuts, part of a two-year \u00a3100m savings plan, viewed as a necessary move if the broadcaster expects to accept a significant hand-out of public money in the near future to fund its public service broadcasting obligations. <p>Paul Richards, an analyst at Numis, points out that Channel 4 is \"right-sizing\" its cost base which grew by \u00a3240m from \u00a3714m in 2003 to \u00a3954m last year.</p> <p>Much of this cost increase was caused by investments in new areas, such as multichannel TV, however, \"in a very difficult advertising environment, with about 80%-plus revenue from TV ads, you have to cut the cloth to fit the coat,\" said Richards.</p> <p>The dire financial climate has also put paid to any hopes the industry might have had of a takeover of ITV, the uncertainty over the future of BSkyB's 17.9% stake notwithstanding.</p> <p>\"No chance at all, where is the money going to come from?\" asks De Groote. \"No one can raise money.\"</p> <p>Richards, who argues that the ITV executive chairman, Michael Grade, is doing \"pretty well against strong headwinds\", says that the broadcaster is \"too fragile\" for nervous investors to take over. </p> <p>He points out that in 2005 it had pre-tax profits of \u00a3441m while next year ITV, which has already had to overhaul some of its key revenue growth targets, is forecast to make \u00a3180m.</p> <h2>ITV job axe</h2> <br>Richards argues that the forecast for ITV - which is expected to axe hundreds of regional jobs soon and is the largest single destination for UK advertising spend - is a solid bellwether for indicating how long the downturn will last. <p>Numis says ITV ad revenue will slump 6% in 2009, and experience an inevitable minor bounce of sorts to down 2% in 2010.</p> <p>ITV is not predicted to hit real growth in ad revenue again until 2011 when Numis predicts 2% increase.</p> <p>BSkyB's primarily subscription-based model does not make it immune from the downturn. One analyst's \"hunch\" is that with tighter pockets BSkyB will see higher churn, with subscribers \"spinning down\" to cheaper packages, which may in turn scupper departed chief executive James Murdoch's much-hyped target of 10 million subscribers by 2010.</p> <h2>Safe pair of hands</h2> <br>Regional newspaper publisher Johnston Press, which has taken a battering due to its exposure to freefalling ad sectors such as recruitment and property, has been under the eye of analysts. <p>The company was trading at a debt level four times operating profits - analysts prefer a ratio closer to 2:1 - although this has dropped to around 3.6 times, according to Numis, following its <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/jun/24/johnstonpress.pressandpublishing\">\u00a3170m rights issue in June</a>, with a further drop to 2.8 times expected next year. </p> <p>The appointment of Archant chief John Fry, to take over from Tim Bowdler, has been <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/greenslade/2008/sep/22/1\">viewed as a positive move</a> as the markets deteriorate.</p> <p>\"He is a safe pair of hands, a known quantity, he knows the issues that have eroded consumer confidence and there will not be unrealistic expectations on him,\" said De Groote.</p> <p>DMGT's more diverse portfolio in the business-to-business sector has led to analysts looking more favourably on its outlook.</p> <p>The finance director, Peter Williams, said yesterday that he \"hoped that the level of decline would start to slow down\" but that in the next 12 months the company did not expect the market to pick up.</p> <p>Such big falls now, he said, should at least mean that this time next year things appear to be better on a like-for-like comparison basis, even if the market is still declining.</p> <h2>Cover price increases</h2> <br>National newspapers, with more resilient advertising and loyal readers, have looked to cover price rises as a way to guarantee some revenues. <p>The Times has pushed up to 80p, the Telegraph to 90p and the new full-colour Independent is a princely \u00a31.</p> <p>\"It is relatively predictable,\" says Roger Parry, non-executive chairman of Johnston Press and Future Publishing. \"Among core readership there is a lot of evidence of surprisingly little elasticity of demand. They will have done the numbers.\"</p> <p>Parry believes, political affiliations aside, that there may not be any real \"clarity\" in the media market until \"the uncertainty of the economic and political direction is known\" after the next general election.</p> <p>Even the seemingly inexorable rise of digital media has not emerged unscathed from the downturn. Two companies, Enders and PricewaterhouseCoopers, have both revised down growth figures for 2008 for online advertising.</p> <p>A revision down from about 27% to 18% year-on-year growth is not in itself cause for concern. Internet search advertising is set to remain buoyant, with a tasty 25% growth rate. But growth forecasts for online display advertising and classified advertising, have slumped to 9.8% and 7.8% in 2008 respectively, down from 31% and 54% respectively in 2007. </p> <p>\"No one knows if we have reached the bottom of the cycle yet,\" said Dominic Proctor, the chief executive WPP-owned media operation Mindshare Worldwide. \"Marketing dollars haven't dried up yet but they have slowed down in most markets and that will strangle weaker media.\"</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediaguardian.co.uk\">editor@mediaguardian.co.uk</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p>Everyone has to make tough decisions in life. Opting to take redundancy at The Argus in Brighton after 17 years' service was one of my most difficult.</p> <p>I agonised over it almost beyond the point of reason.<br></p> <p>Several sleepless nights were involved. I thought that it might open the door to a new challenge but felt the burden of responsibility to my dependents, my wife and student son. My wage packet hardly bulged and it was only some sanctioned freelance work that kept our heads above water in a tide of rising costs. </p> <p>I was also worried about whether the credit crunch - which hit newspapers years before it became fashionable - and my age would work against me. Would employment be out there for a dinosaur who had spent his whole working life in newspapers, specialising in sports writing and subbing? It appeared I was stuck between a rock and a hard place. </p> <p>Signs had been on the wall for years at The Argus. An evening paper for more than 120 years with around four editions, it had become a morning daily with just one. And it was attracting less and less advertising. The publication's future looked bleak.</p> <p>The environment reflected it, cranky old computers, cluttered desks, erratic air conditioning, popping bulbs and low morale in an open-plan office on a faceless industrial estate.</p> <p>Around 10 redundancies had been made about a year before and the same figure was touted during this latest round. More, many believed, were on the way by the end of the year.</p> <p>I will never forget the start of my process to departure - it was July's Black Friday, when the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2008/jul/16/jobsgoatbrightonargus\">staff was told by the editor </a>that redundancies were on the way with the publication of sister paper The Sports Argus - a weekly all-sports paper - due to cease.</p> <p>He told us he was unable to say how many, while inviting voluntary redundancies. He was also unable to say exactly when the axe would fall on TSA. </p> <p>The Argus NUJ branch - with FOC Tim Norman at the forefront - sought answers that weren't forthcoming. The rumour mill had it that two of the redundancies would come from the sports desk. After all, it was first in the firing line with the impeding demise of the sports paper. Most members of our desk had wives and children. One had a partner about to give birth. There was much disquiet.</p> <p>My decision to apply for \"voluntary\" - after consulting my family, the editor, personnel, the NUJ and colleagues - helped ease concern.</p> <p>I came to a settlement after the editor accepted my application and I left on August 22 this year. I hold no animosity towards him as I knew he was merely a front man for the cowardly bean counters concerned purely with money rather than any life-changing effects on staff.</p> <p>My mother-in-law wrote me a note saying that leaving The Argus could be \"the best thing that has happened to you for quite a while\". I believe that will eventually prove the case, because I'm self-motivated, resourceful, durable, experienced and talented.</p> <p>I've picked up work through contacts and putting out \"feelers\" for more while keeping an eye on the full-tie market. </p> <p>Onwards and upwards.</p>",
  "<p>Everything is relative. In Zimbabwe, Dynamos FC are nicknamed the Glamour Boys because they're the country's most popular club. But in the wider world of African, let alone global, football, that sobriquet could easily be seen as sarcastic. For financially Dynamos are in dire straits even though they can sell out their 45,000-capacity stadium, where at the start of this season the cheapest tickets cost \u2026 one hundred million dollars.</p> <p>Zimbabwe is no place for abacuses. It's a country where even official figures put inflation at over two million % (and independent estimates place it at more than 10 times that rate) and where last May the central bank, concerned that it was running out of paper and further into the realms of the absurd, issued $50bn notes. With an exchange value of 17p, one of those notes was enough buy you one egg in Harare.</p> <p>Two months later, the government announced its second currency revaluation since 2006, chopping 10 zeros off existing denominations so that the $10,000,000,000 note was now worth a single dollar. Wags suggested that removing the \"1\" at the front would have been more appropriate. Earlier this month, the government effectively did just that by declaring foreign currency as legal tender in the country.</p> <p>There's the context. Now here's the story of the greatest football achievement of the season. It's a story without an end as yet, but if what's happened so far is anything to go by it will culminate with Dynamos being crowned the most unlikely continental champions ever.</p> <p>Actually, first here's a little more context. African club football has always been dominated by north and west Africa. Congolese clubs were an ephemeral force in the late 60s and early 70s, but only Orlando Pirates in 1995 have intruded from the south. Dynamos, on their one previous appearance in the African Champions League, managed to reach the final in 1998 before losing to Ivorian giants ASEC Mimosa in what you might describe as controversial circumstances: the various ruses devised to upset the visitors before the second leg in Abidjan reached a nadir during the pre-match warm-up, when a brawl broke out and Dynamos' captain, Memory Mucherahowa, was headbutted into unconsciousness.</p> <p>Since then, the standard of football in the Zimbabwean league has plummeted along with the country's economy, with players migrating en masse to South Africa. It is damning that Star TV, the southern Africa satellite TV channel, regularly screens live matches from South Africa, Kenya and Zambia but doesn't bother with the Zimbabwean league. Dynamos may have ended 10 barren years by claiming the league and cup double last season but only two of their players are in the Zimbabwe squad that has already been eliminated from the 2010 African Cup of Nations \u2014 despite the fact that Dyanmos' manager, David Mandigora, is also assistant to the national team.</p> <p>Yet last Saturday, Dynamos beat Zamalek to reach the semi-finals of the African Champions League. Zamalek! The Egyptians, who've won the tournament five times, boast a slew of internationals and are flush enough to employ an expensive German coach and pay Amr Zaky's replacement, Junior Agogo, some \u00a3300,000 per year. Those resources should put them in another world to the Glamour Boys. \"Dynamos players are stars because they play for Dynamos, not because of their modest wages,\" says Petros Kausiyo of the Harare Herald. \"They are probably paid a little more than the average wage, but nothing extravagant,\" he adds.</p> <p>\"We don't have salaries as such,\" says Mandigora. \"We are paid on a match-to-match basis depending on results and attendances.\" Understandably the players are eager to make the most of their Champions League success. Minutes before kick-off agaisnt Zamalek, they threatened to go on strike over outstanding bonuses; with the government having capped withdrawals at $100bn per day, club backers would only have been able to cough up if they'd spent virtually every day of the previous month toing and froing to the bank. In the end the players were placated by assurances and proof that the club had indeed sought permission for an exceptional withdrawal from the national reserve.</p> <p>The other teams in Dynamos' group were no less daunting than Zamalek. There were the other Cairo giants \u2014 and also five-times African champions \u2014 Al Ahly, plus old chums ASEC Mimosa who, as one of the most consistent clubs on the continent, have reached the group stages in nine of the last 12 seasons. Even getting to the group stages was an astonishing feat for Dynamos, particularly as it entailed shocking reigning champions Etoile du Sahel. \"After winning 1-0 in the home leg, the players went to Tunisia for the second leg and it was amazing to watch them,\" says Kausiyo. \"Most of them were clearly in awe when they saw Etoile's facilities. But then the manager got them together and gave a fantastic speech, and they went on to inflict Etoile's first ever home defeat in the tournament.\"</p> <p>\"I basically just explained to them that money isn't everything,\" says Mandigora, whose task had been complicated by the fact that Dynamos only arrived in Tunis a few hours before the game because of the difficulty of finding sponsors to fund their travel, which cost a cool $10 trillion. \"Life isn't easy,\" continues 51-year-old Mandigora, formerly a player at the club he now coaches. \"The fact is you can only achieve things through hard work. That is what I always tell my players and our good results have proved to them that it's true. Now they are full of confidence and our fighting spirit is magnificent.\"</p> <p>Not that fighting spirit is the only reason for their success. \"We like to keep the ball on the ground and play a passing style,\" says Mandigora. \"I only play with one striker and have five across midfield. We are well organised and the speed of players such as Philip Marufo and Edward Sadomba causes teams a lot of trouble.\"</p> <p>To progress to the final, Dynamos will next month have to overcome the Cameroonian champions, Cotonsport Garoua, who have at last reached the semi-finals after years of underachievement on the continent. Though not as strapped as Dynamos, Cotonsport do have financial woes of their own \u2014 their French manager Denis Lavagne walked out over unpaid wages \u2014 but at least they have sponsors on their shirt, unlike Dynamos, the only team in the group stages with blank jerseys.</p> <p>Bearing in mind that Dynamos are in the midst of a boardroom battle that in August resulted in a mob barging into the club's HQ and whacking opponents with baseball bats, iron bars and knobkerries, one of the biggest issues for them to resolve before the semi-final is the price of tickets for the home leg. \"Dynamos regard themselves as the people's club but some observers argue that they were foolish not to raise prices for the Zamalek match, to which almost all of Harare wanted to go,\" says Kausiyo.</p> <p>So far, Dynamos have not raised their prices throughout their campaign, even though rivals have tried to cash in on their success; after the Glamour Boys beat Etoile last May, their next domestic opponents, Kiglon Bird, jacked up the price of the cheapest ticket to $500m. That backfired when a mere 85 supporters paid \u2026 and 3,000 others stormed the stadium, knocking down one of the walls.</p> <p>\"The executive committee will meet next week and decide on the prices but the fans will always be foremost in our minds,\" says Dynamos general secretary Tawanda Murerekwa. Murerekwa has certainly bought into the football optimism that is suddenly sweeping Zimbabwe. \"I think we will be No1 now,\" he said. Becoming No1 would mean scooping the Champions League's $1m prize fund \u2014 that's <em>US</em> dollars. \"Winning the tournament would go a long way to securing the club's future,\" said Murerekwa, adding: \"We would be able to do things like get training equipment and a team bus.\"</p> <p>The symbolism of a team bus would be powerful. It was an inability to pay an outstanding debt to a bus hire company in 2004 that forced the Zimbabwe FA into an embarrassing sale, when it had to auction off everything from chairs, filing cabinets and a refrigerator to staplers and reams of paper. And still only raised enough to cover one-third of the debt.</p> <p>In the short term, however, a Dynamos victory in the Champions League would probably increase the exodus of talent rather than decrease it. \"I've just had a call from a South African agent who wants to come and watch us this weekend,\" revealed Mandigora when I spoke to him yesterday. \"It will be hard to stop our players leaving. They can earn much more in South Africa than they can here.\"</p>",
  "<p>A project that will give hundreds of thousands of people in developing countries access to community-based financial services will be launched today in New York.</p> <p>The programme is led by Barclays and follows a pilot project the bank has been undertaking in Uganda to support Village Savings and Loans Associations (VSLAs) in a joint project with the Guardian.</p> <p>Over the past year, the bank has been supporting the expansion of <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/2008/apr/18/background.livelihoods\">VSLAs</a></strong> in Katine, a sub-county of north east Uganda. Barclays is donating \u00a31.5m to a three-year development project in the region being carried out by the African Medical and Research Foundation and Farm Africa, and supported by the Guardian.</p> <p>Today's announcement will see the expansion of existing community-based financial services, such as VSLAs, and the introduction of new programmes in 10 countries across Africa, Asia and Latin America. Barclays will invest $20m (\u00a310.8m) over three years to fund microfinance schemes with Care International, which is working with Barclays in Katine, and Plan International. It will also be working with consultancy firm Accenture. </p> <p>The project will be announced by the former US president Bill Clinton at the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) annual meeting in New York, expected to be attended by more than 50 current or former heads of states. The CGI was established to spearhead change in the areas of education, global health, poverty alleviation and energy and climate change.</p> <p>The programme builds on <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/2008/jun/10/livelihoods.projectgoals\">Barclays work</a></strong> in Katine and similar microfinance projects in <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/katineblog/2008/may/21/grassrootsbankingforkatine\">Ghana</a></strong>.</p> <p>VSLAs are set up and run by small groups of between 15 to 20 people who want a safe place to save their money and access small loans. Each member of the association deposits a regular sum, on a weekly or monthly basis, which provides a pool of money from which members can borrow to pay unexpected bills and expenses. Each year the association is wound up and members are given back their stake with added interest. The group is then reformed. Interest rates are high \u2013 around 10% - which means loans are often short-term.</p> <p>Microfinance has been hailed as a major step towards reducing poverty, empowering people to govern their own finances, and the VSLAs being introduced across Katine form part of the project's livelihoods component. But these financial schemes are not without critics, who question whether they can really help the very poor and believe high interest rates could lead to greater debt levels.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/katineblog/2008/jun/04/whatisbarclaysdoinginkati\">The bank</a></strong> is now working with Care International and Ugandan NGO UWESO to help establish 200 VSLAs across Katine. It also wants to develop more sophisticated financial services for people with more capital and to encourage people to use other banking services. Barclays opened a branch in Soroti earlier this year.</p> <p>Julius Moses Otim, the <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/2008/aug/06/livelihoods.projectgoals\">chairman of the Ojemorun United Farmers Group</a></strong> in Katine, which formally established a VSLA last month, told the Guardian that the association would help the group fight poverty by increasing its income-generating powers. \"As a farmer you may be running a small business on the side, or you may have a business idea, such as trading in firewood or produce, but you lack capital. The VSLA will now allow us to borrow some money,\" he said.</p> <p>Barclays will be seeing if the work in Katine <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/katineblog/2008/sep/26/aidanddevelopment.internationalaidanddevelopment\">could be replicated</a></strong> elsewhere in Africa. Similar projects could be introduced elsewhere in Uganda and further afield in Zambia and Mozambique.</p> <p>Archie Cox, chairman of Barclays Americas, said: \"Tackling financial exclusion is one of the most powerful routes to helping people break out of the poverty cycle. By improving access to financial services, this partnership aims to provide people with the financial security needed to build a sustainable future, educate their children and meet basic needs such as health and nutrition.\"</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Care International, added that the new partnership was \"an important contribution to Care's ongoing work to tackle financial exclusion across the world\".</p> <p>She added that the partnership would support Care's ambitious Access Africa programme, which aims to deliver financial services to 30 million people in Africa over the next 10 years.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/houseprices\">House prices</a> fell by 4.6% in the year to the end of August, the Land Registry said today - the first time its index has shown a fall since it was launched in April 2000.</p> <p>The figures showed sharp falls over the month with the average price of a home in England and Wales falling 1.9% to \u00a3174,493.</p> <p>This follows two months of flatlining prices and several months of falling growth, as the impact of the credit crunch has been felt on the market.</p> <p>A lack of available <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/mortgages\">mortgages</a> and falling confidence in the housing market and wider economy have all combined to deter would-be buyers, and the lack of demand has translated into sharp falls.</p> <p>The Land Registry figures are based on completed sales, and only cover homes that have been sold before.

  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-338022473\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>The escalating crisis in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/wallstreet\">the global financial system</a> has claimed its biggest victim yet with the collapse last night of the US savings and loan group, Washington Mutual. </p> <p>In America's largest-ever banking failure, Federal regulators seized the group's assets in the early hours of this morning and sold them to JP Morgan Chase for $1.9bn (\u00a31.03bn). </p> <p>Founded in Seattle in 1889 and known as WaMu, the group is the nation's biggest savings and loans company - the US equivalent to a British building society. The deal will make JP Morgan the largest bank in the US, ahead of Bank of America.</p> <p>It is the second time during <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/creditcrunch\">the credit crunch</a> that JP Morgan has stepped in - in March, it took over <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/bearstearns\">Wall Street rival Bear Stearns</a> in a rescue orchestrated by the US Federal Reserve.</p> <p>The face of the global financial industry has changed dramatically in the past fortnight. The US government has taken over mortgage finance giants <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/freddiemacandfanniemae\">Fannie Mac and Freddie Mac</a> and bailed out the insurer American International Group for $85bn. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/lehmanbrothers\">Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/merrilllynch\">Merrill Lynch has been sold to Bank of America</a>. In Britain, Lloyds TSB has agreed the takeover of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/hbosbusiness\">troubled mortgage lender HBOS</a>.</p> <p>Funded by deposits and less exposed to toxic mortgage investments than rivals, JP Morgan and Bank of America have emerged as the big winners in the current crisis. </p> <p>The WaMu deal was masterminded by Sheila Bair, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, on terms that avoid a huge drain on the insurance fund that protects deposits of up to $100,000. Analysts estimate that a WaMu failure could have soaked up half the money in the government insurance fund, forcing a huge increase in the premiums paid to the fund by other banks.</p> <p>The move came as the Bush administration's $700bn bailout plan for the financial sector ran into trouble. The package could have helped WaMu, but regulators decided that waiting any longer \"was not a responsible decision to make,\" Bair said. </p> <p>Customers have rushed to take their money out of WaMu, which has suffered $16.7bn of deposit withdrawals in the last fortnight. The firm held $188bn in deposits as of June, far more than any US bank that has ever failed. </p> <p>WaMu has seen its share price virtually wiped out after it made thousands of mortgage loans that its borrowers cannot repay, saddling it with billions of dollars in bad debts. The company has posted losses for the last three quarters, including a loss of $3.3bn for the most recent quarter, ending in June. It put itself up for sale last week but could not attract any bidders.</p> <p>JP Morgan is buying WaMu's 2,200 branches, its $135bn of deposits and its vast portfolio of troubled mortgage-related investments. The deal does not affect depositors or people with mortgage loans held by WaMu.</p> <p>JP Morgan said it would immediately write down $31bn of those investments and that it would add $3.6bn to its own loss reserves. The company also said it would issue $8bn in common stock this morning before the US markets open, creating a larger capital cushion. </p> <p>JP Morgan's chief executive Jamie Dimon said he was undeterred by WaMu's financial problems. \"We're getting franchises of this company for a long period of time,\" he said. The bank will gain long-desired presence on the west Coast as WaMu's branches are concentrated in California.</p> <p>In March, WaMu rejected an offer of $8 a share from JP Morgan.

  "<p>Britain has been accused of trying to wreck Europe's plan to tackle climate change by lobbying to remove aviation from renewable energy targets. <br> <a href=\"http://image.theguardian.com/sys-files/Environment/documents/2008/09/26/Page18.pdf\">Leaked documents</a> from the council of the European Union show that the UK is exerting strong pressure on other EU governments. The argument being used is that biofuels made from plants or algae will not be ready for use as commercial aviation fuel until after 2020. </p> <p>EU leaders pledged last year to generate 20% of all energy from renewable sources but if aviation, which contributes up to 9% of all greenhouse emissions in Europe, is omitted from the EU calculations at a meeting of energy ministers next week, it will significantly reduce the overall target and make it harder to tackle climate change. </p> <p>Last night, in an unusual move, an adviser to the EU Industry Committee openly stated that British civil servants were leading the attempt by several countries including Cyprus, Italy and Malta to undermine the EU's renewable energy commitments. </p> <p>Luxembourg MEP Claude Turmes, who denied that the leaked documents came from his office, said: \"Britain is leading the attempt to undermine the climate change directive. Gordon Brown promised that the UK would not attempt to cut the EU 20% renewables target. </p> <p>\"Now UK civil servants from the Department of Business, enterprise and regulatory reform have a different strategy and are pushing for cuts. A government that is supposedly committed to tackle climate change must not try to kill the essence of this directive.\"</p> <p>The document, seen by the Guardian, states that \"member states want the aviation sector to be excluded from the denominator used to calculate the overall target. They consider that in the present state of technology we cannot expect it to be possible for biofuels that can replace kerosene to be certified for commercial aviation by 2020\".</p> <p>This was disputed by Virgin Atlantic. \"We expect to run 5% of our fleet on biofuels, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2006/sep/21/globalwarming.climatechange\">10% by 2020</a>,\" said a spokesman. On Thursday, other aviation companies joined Virgin in committing to a similar shift to biofuels by 2020. </p> <p>Britain has the largest aviation industry in Europe. If it succeeds in having it exempted, it stands to reduce by nearly 12% the amount of renewable energy it will need to generate by 2020. </p> <p>Earlier this year the government set out what is considered to be an ambitious but achievable \u00a3100 billion commitment to renewables by 2020. An energy white paper, now passing through parliament, seeks to make Britain the first country in the world committed to 60% cuts in emissions.</p> <p>Environment groups said that if Britain removed aviation from Europe's commitments it would open the door for other countries to plead special cases for their most polluting industries and render the directive nearly meaningless.</p> <p>Robin Webster, Friends of the Earth's energy campaigner accused business minister John Hutton of trying to wreck the EU renewables deal: \"His special pleading for the aviation industry could unravel this priceless agreement. It's time Brown stepped in and saved Britain's reputation in Brussels.\" </p> <p>He added: \"The government is working behind the scenes to sabotage Europe's renewable energy plans. This short sighted approach will leave families facing spiralling fuel prices and saddle the country with a multi-billion pound bill for dealing with the consequences of climate change.\" </p> <p>This is the third time that Dberr officials have been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/aug/13/renewableenergy.energy\">exposed by the Guardian</a> trying to undermine EU renewables energy targets. Last year Gordon Brown <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/aug/14/energy.renewableenergy\">reacted angrily</a> to other leaked documents showing that Britain was trying to persuade EU countries to set lower renewable targets.</p> <p>The latest papers seen by the Guardian also show Britain trying to water down a series of renewable energy proposals in other areas. DBerr officials want to change a pledge that all new and refurbished buildings should be fitted with renewable energy sources like solar or wind power. Instead, countries would only have to increase \"gradually\" the minimum level of energy from renewable sources.</p> <p>In addition, the UK is pressing for countries to be allowed to choose the speed at which they introduce renewable energy and is eager to allow large projects started before 2020 to be included. </p> <p>These proposals would allow governments pass on the necessity to switch to renewables to future administrations and could allow them to start major projects as late as 2019 and claim credit for them even if they were not finished for a decade or more.</p> <p>It further wants to change the rules that would give renewable electricity projects priority access to national grids. </p> <p>Last week other leaked papers showed that Britain wanted Brussels to offset more domestic carbon savings through investment in clean projects in the developing world. </p> <p>The move would let firms and countries import more carbon credits to count against their pollution targets. It would allow Europe to make less effort to cut its pollution, while keeping it on course to meet its target of reducing carbon emissions by 20% by 2020.</p>",

  "<p>It was around this time last year when scenes from Burma flooded our television <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv4oNQySSzY\">screens</a>, our airwaves and our <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article2516773.ece\">newspapers</a> as Britain \u2013 and the world \u2013 became glued to the unfolding \"Saffron Revolution\". </p> <p>Thousands upon thousands of monks took to the streets to lead a popular uprising \u2013 appalled in part by the dire human rights situation in their homeland. And exactly a year ago today those protests in Burma were met by brutal force from the ruling military junta.</p> <p>Hundreds were injured in the crackdown as the security forces unleashed a wave of batons and bullets. Official sources put the death toll at 13 \u2013 the real figure is believed to be far higher. </p> <p>Thousands were rounded up, monks were swept off the streets and a strict curfew imposed. Here in the UK, <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=17475\">Amnesty International organised rallies</a> and marches to show our solidarity. </p> <p>A Facebook group attracted over 700,000 members. Similar protests happened across the globe, but the Burmese authorities stayed defiant.</p> <p>A year on it is time to once more remember the plight of those that remain and renew the call for urgent action from the United Nations security council.</p> <p>Nearly 1,000 people remain in detention for their part in those protests \u2013 each one is at risk of torture \u2013 and over 800 political prisoners have been sentenced to prison terms.</p> <p>The arrests themselves show what scant regard the Burmese authorities have for international opinion. In November 2007, the Burmese prime minister Thein Sein promised the global community that there would be no more political arrests. Yet just last month, <a href=\"http://www.nowpublic.com/world/burma-88-student-woman-activist-nilar-thein-arrested\">Nilar Thein</a>, the wife of an 88 Generation Student Group leader, was arrested while on a visit to her mother. Her baby daughter has been left in the care of relatives.</p> <p>On the eve of the crackdown, there were approximately 1,150 political prisoners in Burma. One year on, there are more than 2,100. And there are now more long-standing political prisoners in Burma than at any other time since the infamous August 8 1988 uprising there 20 years ago, when 3,000 people were killed by the same military junta.</p> <p>Over the past few days, there has been some good news as prominent political dissident and journalist <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=17881\">U Win Tin was released from jail</a> \u2013 along with six other prisoners of conscience. Win Tin spent 19 years in horrendous prison conditions and was one of Burma's longest-serving prisoners of conscience. </p> <p>The other six prisoners of conscience released are also National League for Democracy members and four are MPs-elect from the 1990 elections in which the NLD was victorious. </p> <p>The release of these seven prisoners of conscience is certainly welcome, but what about the other 2,100 political prisoners?</p> <p>The situation cannot be allowed to continue and the one organisation that can truly make a difference is the UN security council. It has the power to impose some real high-level pressure on Burma.</p> <p>To date the UN's efforts at diplomacy can hardly be characterised as a success. Yes, the UN special rapporteur for human rights has visited the country twice (in November 2007 and August 2008) and the secretary general's special envoy, Ibrahim Gambari, four times (most recently in August 2008). </p> <p>But little has come from those visits. Indeed, it could be argued that the last trip by Ibrahim Gambari has made it worse. On his last trip, he implicitly promised support for the country's elections in 2010 and endorsed the country's extremely flawed constitution, which was passed earlier this year. </p> <p>The constitution will institutionalise the army's grip on the state apparatus \u2013 the ministries of home affairs and foreign affairs, for example, will have to be run by a member of the army. It also fails to promote and protect human rights and even codifies impunity for past and future human rights violations. </p> <p>The only body that can effectively question Gambari's implicit support for the constitution and hold Burma to account is the security council. </p> <p>It is up to the UN to act now or else the efforts of the brave monks of the Saffron Revolution, and the millions across the world that showed their solidarity with them, will have been in vain.</p>",

  "<p>The trio of Ofcom grandees, who unveiled proposals allowing ITV to savage its regional news, were pretty snappy under fire at their press conference yesterday and you can see why.</p> <p>They are trapped in a maze of contradictions and feeling pretty impotent.<br><br>They trumpet their mission in this public service broadcasting review, to recommend to government how quality can be maintained. But the reality is their influence is so limited that they fall back on the defence it's the system that is broken. And, in what sometimes seems like a displacement exercise, they propose future solutions.</p> <p>But what about the system of regulation that allowed this to happen? As I sat in the press conference I thought back to Jocelyn Hay, the outgoing consumer champion, chair of the Voice of the Listener &amp; Viewer who said bitterly in a recent Media Guardian interview that the public had been \"hoodwinked\" over assurances that the 2003 Communications Act would preserve the best of the old system.</p> <p>Ofcom spells out that it has only limited scope to protect children's programmes in \"the absence of a statutory basis to set quotas\". I don't think this is what the public thought they were getting.</p> <p>Let's get real and say light touch regulation hasn't worked very well in the global banking system, and it does not seem to be working very well for viewers in key media sectors either.</p> <p>The unions, the NUJ and Bectu are rightly protesting about the \u00a340m a year that ITV is going to excise from its budgets by cutting in the regions. Ofcom blustered about the evils of the old regime, which tried to micro manage, for example, by stipulating where local news stations were placed. But, frankly, that is the point.</p> <p>We've swung from that (unfortunate) model to the current one in which Ofcom is virtually toothless, it has no powers to stop the cuts and, in addition, has precious little influence. ITV bluntly told the regulator it was making the \u00a340m cuts, regardless.</p> <p>So Ofcom, having actively facilitated the ITV merger back in 2003, can only judge after the fact when the jobs have gone. </p> <p>The reorganisation, with news gathering hubs, enlarged regions - stretching from Penzance to Worcester for example - will also end distinct services for quite diverse heavily-populated areas such as the east and west Midlands. It sounds horribly familiar, like a macro version of the reductions that have so stymied local commercial radio and led to its decline.</p> <p>The current system is far from perfect, but now it is heading to extinction. The cutback is also pretty crude in its pragmatic assumption that peak-time audiences are more important than the daytime ones who will be losing their regional news bulletins. What about older housebound people? What happens next time there are local floods?</p> <p>Ofcom will argue it negotiated as hard as it could. It's just that its leaders seem so bloodless in their willingness to accept the position.</p> <p>We're looking at a regulator that is powerful on analysis and research, presentation and consultation, but weak elsewhere. It is trying to create a consensus as power ebbs away from the (distracted) Labour government that created it.</p> <p>Last week Ed Richards, chief executive of Ofcom, made a speech which ended rather wistfully: \"We face important judgments. Get those judgments wrong and will there be a terminal cataclysm for our society? Of course not. It's just that our lives will be a bit narrower, a bit greyer, a bit duller as a result.\"</p> <p>And there's the rub. He is trying to inch government towards what he hopes will be a decision and, consequently, limited legislation. But Ofcom cannot alter the constitution of Channel 4 so it can receive licence fee funds, nor can it strip the BBC of a share in BBC Worldwide, or devise a levy on blank tapes and downloads to support public service content. </p> <p>For a nation facing inflation, job losses, bank rescues and recession, propping up Channel 4 and trying to build back a system of local and regional news services looks pretty minor.</p> <p>Not a happy place to be.</p>"
