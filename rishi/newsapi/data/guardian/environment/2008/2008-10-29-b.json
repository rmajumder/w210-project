  "<p>Attempting to scare swing voters onto their side in the US presidential campaign, the McCain-Palin ticket has taken to <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-campaign19-2008oct19,0,1946625.story?track=rss\">throwing around the term \"socialism\"</a> to define Barack Obama's argument in support of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/oct/22/john-mccain-barack-obama-socialism\">progressive taxation</a>. The latter will create more equality, or in Obama's own words, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owA2geM8OGg\">\"spread the wealth around\"</a>. Yet while Obama, with billionaire businessman Warren Buffett and former US Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker among his top financial advisers, may support a more equitable America, he is no socialist.<br> Which isn't to say that an Obama administration couldn't inspire socialist policies or attitudes. And to my mind, that's nothing to be ashamed of. As someone whose secular \"rabbis\" were socialist thinkers, like the late writer and activist Michael Harrington and the literary and political thinker and Yiddishist Irving Howe, I find it intriguing and inspiring to hear this debate - though not as it's being framed by McCain. </p> <p>There has long been a progressive, home-grown socialist tradition in the US, even if in recent decades it has waned - until perhaps now. At the turn of the 20th century, it was the middle-American socialism of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_V._Debs\">Eugene Debs</a>, whose Indiana, trade-union roots helped him lure hundreds of thousands of passionate urban Jewish immigrants to his cause. During the 1950s and 1960s, it was the urbane, religiously inspired socialism of Norman Thomas, an ordained Presbyterian minister from Ohio, who served as the moral voice of a nation, famously telling protesters in one of the earliest demonstrations against the Vietnam war: \"We have come to cleanse the [American] flag, not to burn it.\" </p> <p>Harrington took his inspiration from Dorothy Day's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Worker_Movement\">Catholic Worker movement</a>. His 1962 book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Other-America-Poverty-United-States/dp/068482678X\">The Other America</a> inspired another president - Lyndon Johnson - to declare a \"war\" on poverty. Harrington died in 1989, but his writings are as prescient today as they were when he wrote them. He sometimes called his philosophy \"republican socialism\", harkening back to the founding principles of the nation, when the US broke from the English monarchy to create a republic of citizens, rather than be subjects of the crown. </p> <p>Years ago, I was given a framed broadside of socialist inspiration as a gift from a family member of another well-regarded American socialist, Sidney Hillman. A rabbi's grandson, Hillman came from Russia to America, founded the Amalgamated Clothing Workers union and was a key player in domestic politics during Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal. Today, these words of Harrington hang above my desk:</p> <blockquote> <p>I insist that the political, social and economic development of modern society points socialism toward an ethical, multiclass, and decentralised conception of its goal based on the democratisation of the workplace and the creation of new forms of community, both within the nation and throughout the world. That vision has a remarkable continuity with the basic republican values that derives from both the French and the American revolutions.</p> </blockquote> <p>Obama's stance is significant, not because he has proclaimed allegiance to socialist ideology - he hasn't - but rather because he is expressing support for notions of social solidarity and interdependency and government intervention akin to European social democracy. Surely the majority of Americans don't link these values to any kind of socialist strain. Unlike Europe, socialism and social democracy are not even part of the American political scene. But Americans are searching for a vision of society different from our present one. That's why the Democratic candidate has been speaking to overflow crowds throughout the campaign. Obama has ignited a generation that may know little about the grand political arguments of an earlier era, but that feels - and \"feels\" is the operative word - that something is terribly wrong.</p> <p>Americans are hungry for an end to the inequality and social meanness that have exemplified the Bush years. With record-breaking gaps between the rich and the poor, driven by policies that emphasised privatisation, deregulation and lack of government supports, the America the next president will inherit was in deep financial distress even before the recent global financial crash. But we have also been in emotional distress. As we privatised the economy, so too, we privatised social life and the public sphere. And that's where the socialist model is a useful one. It's about engaging people in civic life, recreating a public square that is applicable to a 21st-century world. </p> <p>American socialism was always more about trade union syndicalism, religious values, communitarianism and a profound belief in small \"d\" democracy, small \"r\" republicanism. It was also staunchly anti-authoritarian. (The significant exception to this, of course, was the American Communist party, which drew its ideology from an authoritarian model.) </p> <p>\"Can we really create a space for personal and community freedom in a modern society?\" Harrington wondered. \"No one can be sure. All we can say with confidence is that if such freedom is to come into existence, it will be the result of new global structures of solidarity and justice. Which is to say, of socialism.\"</p> <p>On November 5, when the world wakes up to a new American president, perhaps it will have its answer.</p>",
  "<p>The US Federal Reserve cut <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/interest-rates-us\">interest rates</a> by a half point today, trying to avert a prolonged economic downturn in the wake of the financial crisis.</p> <p>The Fed's open market committee voted unanimously for a reduction in its key fed funds rate to 1%, the lowest since June 2004.</p> <p>America's central bank said: \"The pace of economic activity appears to have slowed markedly, owing importantly to a decline in consumer expenditures. Business equipment spending and industrial production have weakened in recent months, and slowing economic activity in many foreign economies is damping the prospects for US exports.</p> <p>\"Moreover, the intensification of financial market turmoil is likely to exert additional restraint on spending, partly by further reducing the ability of households and businesses to obtain credit.\"</p> <p>The Fed said that in the light of the recent falls in oil prices, which have halved from the summer's record levels, and weakening economic activity, it expects inflation to ease in coming quarters to levels \"consistent with price stability\".</p> <p>Noting that \"downside risks to growth remain,\" the Fed left the door open for further rate cuts. \"The committee will monitor economic and financial developments carefully and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability,\" it said.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/29/market-turmoil-depression-recession-crunch\">Consumer confidence</a> in the world's largest economy has collapsed to a record low following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in mid-September. The worsening labour market is also eroding consumer confidence and fresh figures from the housing market this week showed the drop in property prices was intensifying even before the latest turmoil in financial markets. </p> <p>Wall Street had been expecting the half-point cut in interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 64 points to 9000 on the news, a drop of nearly 0.7%, before rising again by 52 points to 9117 within half an hour of the announcement. Last night, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/table/2008/oct/27/marketturmoil-useconomy\">Dow posted its second biggest daily points rise</a>, surging more than 10%, or 889 points, to 9065. </p> <p>Other stockmarkets around the world roared ahead in the hours preceding the Fed's rate decision, boosted by news that China and Norway had cut their interest rates. In London, the FTSE 100 index closed 8.05% higher at 4242.54 points, up 316.16, the third-biggest rise (both points and percent) in its history. After another day of dramatic trading in Asia, Japan's Nikkei index closed almost 8% higher.</p> <p>Other central banks are expected to follow the Fed in cutting interest rates as authorities fear the worst financial crisis in 80 years will usher in a long global recession and are hoping lower borrowing costs will cushion the blow. </p> <p>The Bank of England's monetary policy committee (MPC) is tipped to chop at least half a point off its benchmark rate at its monthly meeting next Thursday. The European Central Bank is also expected to slice half a point off its rates at its policy meeting on the same day.</p> <p>UK rates are currently at 4.5%. Some experts believe the crisis could even force the Bank to make an emergency rate cut before next week's scheduled meeting. One of the most hawkish members of its monetary policy committee, Tim Besley, said last night that he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/29/inflation-interest-rates-recession-besley\">no longer believed that rates needed to rise to combat inflation</a>.</p> <p>In outspoken criticism of his MPC colleagues, another member, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/29/bankofenglandgovernor-economics\">David Blanchflower</a>, said tonight the committee failed to respond to the warning signs of a looming recession and has wrongly delayed cutting interest rates until it was too late to stop growth contracting and unemployment rising sharply. He said Britain would now endure 18 months of falling output as it felt the full impact of the credit crunch.</p> <p>Several UK economists have pencilled in a three-quarter point rate cut next week, and Goldman Sachs said the Bank of England could move by a full point as there was no reason why the MPC should wait.</p> <p>\"The MPC has never faced such a precipitous decline in the contemporaneous economic indicators or a financial crisis on anything like this scale,\" said economists at Goldman Sachs. \"With the situation in financial markets so fluid, much depends on when (and if) credit markets begin to normalise. But unless and until they do so, the burden on monetary policy will be that much bigger and there seems little to lose by cutting by the full 100 basis points next week.\"</p> <p>Japanese interest rates are just 0.5%, but the Bank of Japan is rumoured to be considering halving them when it meets on Friday in an attempt to weaken the yen. It has risen sharply against other currencies in recent weeks, harming <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/29/economy-japan-sony-toshiba-electrical\">Japanese exporters</a> and prompting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/27/marketturmoil-currencies\">a statement of concern from world leaders</a>.</p> <p>China's central bank cut interest rates by 0.27 percentage points earlier today, the third reduction in six weeks. When the cut takes effect tomorrow, the cost of one-year bank loans will fall to 6.66% from 6.93%, while the benchmark one-year deposit rate drops to 3.6% from 3.87%.<br>Norway's central bank also swung into action today, slicing half a point off its rates to 4.75%.</p> <p>The European Central Bank president, Jean-Claude Trichet, said earlier this week that there was a possibility, but not a certainty, that rates would be cut at the bank's next meeting as inflation risks eased. A reduction would take the ECB benchmark rate down to 3.25%, their lowest level in two years.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/29/alistair-darling-economy\">Alistair Darling</a> tonight defended the UK government's move to raise borrowing to help the economy, saying it would be \"perverse\" to apply the fiscal rules rigidly in the current turbulent times. He also hinted that the Bank of England could cut interest rates to stimulate the economy.</p> <p>\"These are extraordinary times,\" the chancellor said. \"The economy is facing unprecedented global shocks, and we need a new approach that is fit for these new times.\"</p> <p>The economic slowdown is expected to force the government to break its fiscal rules on borrowing, as it attempts to avoid a protracted downturn. The economy is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/25/recession-credit-crunch-economy-ftse\">shrinking much faster than expected</a>, official figures showed last week, by 0.5% in the July to September quarter, seen as the beginning of a recession.</p> <p>\"To increase borrowing in a downturn is sensible - to support people and business across the economy,\" Darling told Cass Business School in London in his annual Mais lecture this evening. \"To apply the fiscal rules in a rigid manner today would be perverse. We would have to take money out of the economy, exacerbating an already difficult situation.\"</p>",

We would have to take money out of the economy, exacerbating an already difficult situation.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/21/taxandspending-economy\">public finances lurched to a record deficit</a> last month, driven down by a weakening economy and government overspending. </p> <p>In his March budget, Darling forecast a shortfall for the 2008/09 fiscal year to March of \u00a343bn. But this week's figures showed that total has been almost reached halfway through the year, forcing him to increase the figure in next month's pre-budget report.</p> <p>But Darling indicated any relaxation of the government's borrowing rules would be temporary: \"People should be in no doubt that government will take the decisions necessary to ensure sustainability in the medium term. To return borrowing and debt to a sustainable level - once these shocks have been worked through - just as we have in the past.\"</p> <p>He also defended the Bank of England's remit to keep inflation at 2% over a two-year period, while hinting that the Bank's monetary policy committee could cut interest rates to help consumers and businesses. </p> <p>The central bank, which joined in an emergency global rate cut earlier this month, has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/29/bankofenglandgovernor-economics\">criticised for not moving more quickly</a> to lower borrowing costs, because it was worried about high inflation after a spike in oil and food prices.</p> <p>While insisting that the Bank's objective of price stability was \"the right one\", Darling pointed out there was discretion about the time period over which inflation was brought back to target. \"In exercising this discretion, the MPC can support, in line with its statutory requirement, the government's wider economic objectives,\" he said.</p> <p>The City expects the Bank to cut interest rates, currently at 4.5%, by at least a half point when it holds its monthly meeting on Thursday next week. The authorities are worried that the worst financial crisis in 80 years will usher in a long global recession.</p> <p>Darling repeated his call for more effective global regulatory cooperation. He said the International Monetary Fund and the Financial Stability Forum, founded under the UK's G7 presidency in 1998, needed to work with national regulators towards a system that gave early warning of incoming global economic and financial shocks.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor\">The Bank of England</a> failed to respond to the warning signs of a looming recession and has wrongly delayed cutting interest rates until it was too late to stop growth contracting and unemployment rising sharply, according to one of the nine members of its monetary policy committee.</p> <p>In outspoken criticism of his MPC colleagues, David Blanchflower said Threadneedle Street had been too optimistic about the ability of the economy to survive the global financial crisis with only a modest downturn in activity and that Britain would now endure 18 months of falling output as it felt the full impact of the credit crunch.</p> <p>Blanchflower was a lone voice calling for cuts in interest rates from the MPC during the summer and used a speech in Canterbury, Kent to say that the other members had been wrong to ignore his warnings.</p> <p>\"With hindsight, monetary policy has not been sufficiently forward looking. Changes in monetary policy only affect the real economy with a substantial lag. It is not sufficient to consider the data month by month until it emerges that the UK is in recession. </p> <p>\"I believe the trend has been apparent for some time. The synchronised downturn in so many business surveys should have led us to realise sooner that the UK economy was entering a recession.\"</p> <p>Pressing for a hefty cut in borrowing costs when the MPC meets next week, Blanchflower added: \"If rates are not cut aggressively we do face the prospect of a relatively deep and long-lasting recession\".</p> <p>The Bank cut interest rates by half a point to 4.5% earlier this month as part of the co-ordinated global response to the financial turmoil, and the City is expecting a reduction of at least a similar size a week today. Some analysts are calling for rates to be shaved by a percentage point.</p> <p>Blanchflower said policy makers were faced with an \"unusually severe\" international financial problem. </p> <p>\"It is even possible that this event may turn out to be more significant than the 1929 Crash which principally involved bank failures in the US. The current difficulties in financial markets are more global in nature and more comparable to what happened in world war one, when stock exchanges in several countries were closed for extended periods.\"</p> <p>The other members of the MPC were reluctant to cut rates during the summer as inflation rose to a 16-year-high of 5.2% in September. When inflation deviates by more than a percentage point from the Treasury's 2% target, the Bank's governor, Mervyn King, is obliged to write an explanatory letter once a quarter to the chancellor, Alistair Darling, and two have been sent from Threadneedle Street so far this year.</p> <p>Blanchflower said the MPC had over-reacted to the threat that higher imported oil and food prices would trigger a repeat of the 1970s inflationary spiral, and that the real risk during the summer had been of looming recession. The bargaining power of workers was much weaker than in the 1970s, with little chance that they could push up wages in response to rising prices.</p> <p>\"UK output will continue to contract in 2008 and through 2009\", Blanchflower said. \"At the same time CPI (consumer prices index) inflation is likely to fall back sharply over the next year or so to well below the 2% target. My concern is that inflation will be below 1% - and may be even negative - and the MPC will then be writing letters on the low side, which is not a healthy prospect.\"</p> <p>In its last health check on the economy, released in August, the Bank said it expected output to be broadly flat over the coming year, with employment falling a little. Output growth was expected to recover in 2009 as energy prices fell, the credit crunch eased and a weaker pound helped exports. \"This was an optimistic view\", Blanchflower said. \"Clearly output is now begninning to contract, but I think this likelihood was apparent in August.\"</p> <p>He added that at last month's MPC meeting some members had argued that there was a case for higher borrowing costs. \"That was not my view. At that meeting I was alone in voting for an immediate cut in bank rate by half a percentage point.</p> <p>\"I am concerned about the detrimental effect of recent events in financial markets on the UK economy\", Blanchflower said, adding that the 0.5% drop in GDP in the third quarter had occured mainly before this Autumn's market meltdown.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/imf\">International Monetary Fund</a>, the European Union and the World Bank announced a massive rescue package for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/2008/oct/29/hungary-imf\">Hungary</a> today, in an attempt to save <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/29/hungary-forint-imf\">central Europe's former economic powerhouse</a> from bankruptcy.</p> <p>The $25.1bn (\u00a315.38bn) bail-out, which was much larger than expected, aims to help restore investors' confidence in the country's financial markets and its currency, the forint, and marks the first time in the history of the EU that a member state has been rescued by the IMF.</p> <p>The deal comes with strings attached, with the IMF insisting on an introduction of austerity measures to curb high public spending.</p> <p>Right-wing politicians said the agreement endangered Hungary's independence and was an attack on its sovereignty, while some experts warned budget cuts could lead to job losses, exacerbating the already bleak economic situation and increasing the chances of recession.</p> <p>Markets rallied on the news, boosting the forint after weeks in which it has been in freefall, losing about 20% of its value. The Polish zloty and Czech krona also made gains after what was seen as a message to all of Europe's emerging markets that a support network was in place to help them.</p> <p>Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the IMF's managing director, said the loan programme - which includes \u00a39.6bn from the IMF, \u00a34.96bn from the EU and \u00a3790m from the World Bank - would \"bolster the economy's near-term stability and improve its long-term growth potential\".</p> <p>The bail out came as the European Commission called for EU emergency funding available for struggling countries to be more than doubled from \u20ac12bn to \u20ac25bn.</p> <p>After deciding to put up a third of the IMF-engineered package aimed at rescuing Hungary and stabilising the rest of post-communist central Europe, the commission said the crisis fund, last used 15 years ago, should be more than doubled by raising money on the markets through bond issues.</p> <p>\"Some member states and neighbours are under stress. We're ready to act,\" said Joaquin Almunia, the monetary affairs commissioner.</p> <p>The call to more than double the \"balance of payments facility\", used as medium-term loans, is to be put to an emergency EU summit on the financial and economic crisis next week, a meeting that is to prepare the ground for the global economic summit in Washington a week later.</p> <p>Jose Manuel Barroso, the commission's president, said he would unveil a more detailed \"EU recovery plan\" by the end of next month. Barroso spoke of reallocating spending and investments from the EU's six-year \u20ac350bn cohesion funds and of raising the capital base of the European Investment Bank earlier than planned.</p> <p>The commission warned the financial meltdown was ballooning into an economic crisis that would cost jobs, hit business and households, and cut European growth \"significantly\" over the next two years.</p> <p>The financial crisis came as a shock to Hungary, long seen as a solid investor base in former communist Europe. Until recently, the forint had enjoyed a strong standing because of the country's prospects of adopting the euro. </p> <p>As a result of a strong forint and high interest rates, many Hungarians took out mortgages in foreign currency loans. Hungary's heavy dependence on borrowing from abroad at a time of worldwide economic instability had caused investors to question whether the country's economy could continue to survive.</p> <p>The Hungarian central bank's move to increase interest rates by 3% to 11.5% last week did little to stop the flow of money abroad or to boost the forint, making the bail-out package - the equivalent of about a fifth of Hungary's annual economic output - a necessity.</p> <p>It will now allow the Socialist government of Ferenc Gyurcsany to find sufficient funds to finance the 2009 budget. But austerity measures are expected to include a 300 bn forint (\u00a3920m) cut in spending, leading to the loss of highly-treasured social benefits which will hit pensioners and civil servants the hardest as their pensions and wages are curbed.</p>",
  "<p>The tide has certainly turned. For decades, ideas that were once were a reference point for social progress have been derided and marginalised. Now the neo-liberal consensus, which was certain of its own invincibility, has been swept aside by what could well be the greatest financial crisis in history. Millions can now see with their own eyes that the emperor has no clothes. </p> <p>It is an opportunity, certainly, for the left to reassert a vision of a new world. Already, practical and common-sense arguments of the left are being <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/04/greenpolitics.climatechange\">rehabilitated</a>: that we should be the masters of the economy rather than its servants, that the state should direct investment to meet the needs of society, and that those who are most able to pay should make the greatest contribution through their taxes. </p> <p>Ironically, in its own way the scale and swiftness of the bank bail-out has vindicated the slogan of the global justice movement that \"another world is possible\". It would only cost <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7634641.stm\">\u00a32.7bn</a> to save the lives of 6 million children who die due to poverty. Yet in one week governments have come up with more than \u00a3400bn to shore up a failing financial system. Clearly the demands of campaigners and aspirations of whole swathes of humanity are utterly achievable \u2013 if the political will is there.</p> <p>The challenge \"after New Labour\" is to hold on to this truth, as a sea of dangers will also need to be navigated. The casualties of the coming recession will be counted in their millions. Jobs will be lost, homes will be repossessed, poverty will grow.</p> <p>Martin Luther King said that, \"An individual has not started living until he can rise above the narrow confines of his individualistic concerns to the broader concerns of all humanity.\" His words remain as powerful now as they ever were. For the collapse of the old orthodoxy by no means guarantees the emergence of a new human solidarity. A wave of racism and xenophobia could easily engulf a fearful and insecure society. </p> <p>Already disillusionment with the establishment has lead to an alarming rise in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/03/localgovernment.localelections08\">far right</a>. A critical factor in their growth has been the way large sections of the white working class have been taken for granted, their needs effectively ignored by cynical politicians fixated with triangulation. The first-past-the-post system means that all the mainstream parties compete to woo the middle-class voters of a few marginal seats. The sense of abandonment and anger is easily exploited by extremists who wish to ferment racial tension. The answer is not for parties to pander to such simplistic scapegoating by competing to be the toughest on immigration and multiculturalism, but to highlight the need for a more just redistribution of wealth and resources.</p> <p>Other significant sections of the voting population also feel the political system has failed them. It is simply too unresponsive to popular will. I regularly come across young people disillusioned with any concept of engagement in the democratic process because their experience is one in which they have seen millions participate in anti-war protests, yet be ignored by government. </p> <p>Just as our financial system needs an overhaul, so too does our political system. A vigorous campaign for proportional representation could well be one platform around which the diverse groups committed to peace and social justice could unite. Time after time the British public has shown itself to be more progressive than its supposed representatives \u2013 whether on foreign policy, climate change or public services. The democratic deficit between the British public and their political institutions demands urgent attention.</p> <p><em>\"After New Labour\", the second debate in the \"Who owns the progressive future?\" series, organised by Comment is free &amp; Soundings journal, will take place in London at Kings Place on November 3 at 7pm.

  "<p>World stockmarkets roared back today as traders anticipated another round of global <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/interestrates\">interest rate cuts</a>, following a dramatic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/29/inflation-interest-rates-recession-besley\">surge on Wall Street last night</a>.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/ftse\">FTSE 100</a> closed up 316 points at 4242, an 8.05% gain. Financial stocks led the rally, with HBOS up 28% and Royal Bank of Scotland almost 10% higher. </p> <p>Markets were supported by news of a surprise cut in Chinese interest rates. Norway's central bank also moved into action, slicing half a point off its rates to 4.75%.</p> <p>This came after another day of dramatic trading in Asia, where the Nikkei index closed almost 8% higher.</p> <p>The Nikkei had first jumped over 7% then lost almost all its gains after Honda and Panasonic both posted weaker profits. Speculation of an interest rate cut then sent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business+world/japan\">Japanese shares soaring</a> before the market closed.</p> <p>In America, the markets were calm this afternoon as traders waited to see how much US interest rates will be cut. The Federal Reserve announces its decision this evening, and some analysts believe rates could come down by as much as half a point, to just 1%. Last night the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/table/2008/oct/27/marketturmoil-useconomy\">Dow Jones industrial average posted its second biggest daily points rise ever</a>, surging more than 10% or 889 points to 9065, on optimism of a hefty cut in rates. The index lost 80 points in morning trading on Wall Street.</p> <p>Japanese interest rates are currently just 0.5%, but the Bank of Japan is rumoured to be considering halving them when it meets on Friday, in an attempt to weaken the yen. It has risen sharply against other currencies in recent weeks, harming Japanese exporters and also <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/27/marketturmoil-currencies\">worrying world leaders</a>.</p> <p>Analysts warned, though, that stockmarkets will remain jumpy for some time.</p> <p>\"Although its too early to celebrate, traders are seeing signs that the credit market, which earlier this year paralysed the stockmarkets, is easing up,\" said David Evans, market analyst at BetOnMarkets.com.</p> <p>\"While we are not certain if this was the bottom of the barrel, what we are certain of is that volatility will continue,\" Evans added.</p> <p><strong>Rate cuts on the agenda</strong></p> <p>Faced with a weakening economy, the central bank of China today cut its key lending rate for the third time in six weeks, down from 6.93% to 6.66%.</p> <p>The Bank of England is also likely to cut UK interest rates in the months ahead. One of the most hawkish members of its monetary policy committee, Tim Besley, has now said that he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/29/inflation-interest-rates-recession-besley\">no longer believes that rates need to rise to combat inflation</a>.</p> <p>\"As you will know,\" Besley said in a speech in London, \"there was a time last summer when I judged the upside inflationary risks to be sufficient to warrant an increase in bank rate ... But since then, the sharp fall in commodity prices and the consequently more benign prospects for food and services inflation, as well as the substantial weakening in demand, imply that the upside risks to inflation have diminished significantly.\"</p> <p>The MPC is due to meet next week to consider UK rates, which are currently 4.5%. Some experts believe the financial crisis could even force the Bank of England to make an emergency cut in rates before then.</p> <p>\"It is highly possible that the Bank of England could slash interest rates by as much as one percentage point to 3.50% this week or next,\" said Howard Archer of Global Insight, who believes that the cost of borrowing will fall to 2% next year in an attempt to stimulate the economy.</p> <p>The economic slowdown is also expected to force the government to break its fiscal rules on borrowing, as it attempts to avoid a protracted downturn. Alistair Darling will defend the move in a speech this evening, in which he will argue that economic policy needs to adapt to changing conditions in the markets.</p> <p>\"Three weeks ago, we worked with other countries to put in place a plan to stabilise the banking system. These countries are committed to working together to strengthen supervision in the global financial system.\"</p> <p>\"And today we need the same determination to support the wider economy. To ensure that fiscal policy supports monetary policy, here and across the world, in these exceptional circumstances,\" Darling will tell the Cass Business School in his annual Mais lecture.</p>",
  "<p>The International Energy Agency sought to play down a report that it believes global oil production is falling at a faster rate than previously thought.</p> <p>The Financial Times said a draft of the IEA's annual <a href=\"http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/\">World Energy Outlook</a> calculated world production would fall at a natural annual rate of 9.1% without extra investment.</p> <p>The report came amid suggestions that a number of oil producing countries were finding it harder to finance new projects because of the recent sharp fall in the oil price.</p> <p>\"The future rate of decline in output from producing oil fields as they mature is the single most important determinant of the amount of new capacity that will need to be built globally to meet demand,\" the FT quoted the draft report as saying, adding that the IEA believed it would require a \"significant increase in future investments just to maintain the current level of production.\"</p> <p>The WEO is due to be published next month.

  "<p>Environmental activists are preparing to spend a freezing night at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/kingsnorth\">Kingsnorth</a> power plant in Kent after occupying part of the site in protest against the coal-fired power station. Six Greenpeace protesters plan to project images that show the impact of global warming on to the power station's 220 metre high chimney stack. The group objects to plans by owners E.ON to build a new coal-fired power station at the site.</p> <p>The protest follows an \"amphibious invasion\" at Kingsnorth today by a group of boats led by Greenpeace's Rainbow Warrior. Some 30 campaigners managed to board the jetty at the site and held a ceremony to remember the victims of climate change\". Greenpeace claimed the police cut the mooring ropes of the Rainbow Warrior when it tried to pull alongside the power station. Kent police said they were monitoring the situation but no one had been arrested.</p> <p>Ben Stewart, one of the six protesters who plan to spend the night at the site, said they had evaded a police boat trying to stop them. The six climbed a ladder to a small concrete island, which was then cut off by the falling tide. \"No one can reach the ladder until the tide comes back in so we're safe until morning, unless they send a Chinook [helicopter].\"</p> <p>Stewart and a second protester, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/29/kingsnorth-climatechange\">Will Rose, are members of the so-called Kingsnorth Six,</a> who acquitted last month of causing criminal damage to the power station's chimney stack following a protest last year. </p> <p>Greenpeace said: \"A new Kingsnorth would emit the same amount of carbon dioxide as the 30 least polluting countries in the world combined, and destroy any chance we have of persuading China and India to stop building coal plants.\"</p>",

It repeated its forecast of an operating profit for this year of \u00a5200bn \u2014 down from \u00a5475.3bn last year \u2014 but some analysts said they expected the decline to be even steeper.</p> <p>Sony based the forecast on a euro-yen exchange rate of \u00a5140 for the second half of this fiscal year and on the assumption that share prices in Tokyo would remain largely unchanged for six months from their September 30 levels. Both assumptions have proved optimistic, however: the euro is trading at about \u00a5123 and the Nikkei benchmark index has lost a quarter of its value since this month.</p> <p>Poor overseas sales and the yen's steep rise against the dollar and the euro have forced Japanese exporters, including Canon, Sony, Toyota and Honda, to slash profit forecasts.</p> <p>Sony's chief financial officer, Nobuyuki Oneda, said the outlook was bleak for the normally busy Christmas shopping season. \"The expectations being factored in are that Christmas sales will be considerably negative,\" he said.<br> Sony shares, which have lost 68% this year, today rose 1.95% to \u00a52,035.</p> <p>At Toshiba, the chronic slump in demand for electronic chips sent quarterly operating profit plummeting by 99%. </p> <p>The company, the world's second-biggest maker of Nand flash memory chips for electrical devices, said it was the victim of the plunge in Nand prices and weakening demand.</p> <p>The dollar recorded its biggest single-day rise against the yen since 1974, to \u00a599.79, as reports emerged that the BoJ may halve interest rates to 0.25% when its policy board meets on Friday.</p> <p>The Japanese currency edged back up to about \u00a596 to the dollar, having reached a 13-year high of \u00a590.87 last week.</p> <p>The BoJ, which has been reluctant to participate in coordinated rate cuts, may no longer be able to resist international pressure to act, despite the yen's losses and the Nikkei's rebound over the past two days.</p> <p>\"I think it is getting difficult for the BoJ to distance itself from the international coordination,\" said Naomi Hasegawa at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities. \"The BoJ will have to cut interest rates now that markets are expecting it.

  "<p>In a first, a military judge ruled yesterday that a Guant\u00e1namo detainee's confession was extracted through torture, and excluded it from the trial of a young Afghan detainee at the war court.</p> <p>Afghan police threatened the family of teenager Mohammed Jawad while he was undergoing interrogation at a Kabul police station, said army colonel Stephen Henley, the judge, in a three-page ruling.</p> <p>Jawad, now facing trial by military commission, is accused of throwing a grenade inside an Afghan bazaar in December 2002, which wounded two US soldiers and their Afghan interpreter. None was killed.</p> <p>Henley found in the ruling that there was reason to believe Jawad was under the influence of drugs at the time of his capture and forced confession.</p> <p>He also accepted the accused's account of how he was threatened, while armed senior Afghan officials allied with US forces watched his interrogation.</p> <p>\"You will be killed if you do not confess to the grenade attack,\" the detainee quoted an interrogator as saying. \"We will arrest your family and kill them if you do not confess.\"</p> <p>Jawad confessed, was turned over to US forces and was transferred to Guant\u00e1namo two months later.</p> <p>The judge said he was accepting Jawad's account of what happened to him because the government had been unable to provide timely disclosure of evidence for the coming war crimes trial, scheduled for January 5. A Jawad case prosecutor recently quit the war court to protest over his inability to provide potentially exculpatory evidence.</p> <p>Yesterday's ruling was the first at the war court to exclude a confession on grounds of torture using the international standard, noted attorney Jamil Dakwar, a military commissions observer with the American Civil Liberties Union.</p> <p>In doing so, Dakwar said, the military judge was rejecting a legal opinion by Bush administration lawyers that early on sought to soften the definition of torture by sanctioning threats to family members.</p> <p>\"'Torture' includes statements obtained by use of death threats to the speaker or his family,\" wrote Henley, the military judge. \"The actual infliction of physical or mental injury is not required.\"</p> <p>Said major David JR Frakt, Jawad's defense attorney, who is seeking dismissal of the case and his client's return to his family: \"He the judge is adopting a traditional legal definition of torture, rather than making one up.\"</p> <p>Another judge excluded some statements from the summertime trial of Osama bin Laden's driver, Salim Hamdan.

  "<p>Hungary came to be regarded as one of the most prosperous emerging European countries after the fall of communism in 1989 - a far cry from its satirical description as the \"happiest barrack\" in the Soviet bloc.</p> <p>It attracted a large influx of foreign direct investment and embarked on a rapid and stable growth path. It was barely affected by the Asian and Russian crises in 1997-1998. </p> <p>But the current financial crisis has hit Hungary hardest of all among the EU newcomers and forced it to go <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/29/hungary-forint-imf\">cap in hand to the International Monetary Fund</a>. Just how did the forerunner become the most vulnerable? </p> <p><strong>Massive government debt</strong></p> <p>Part of the problem can be pinned on the large government debt that Hungary inherited from the communists. The situation was exacerbated because Hungary, unlike Poland, did not receive partial debt forgiveness at the time of transition. </p> <p>But blaming the communists only goes so far since Hungary successfully reduced its debt from a peak of 90% of GDP in 1993 to 52% in 2001 - it has since gone back up to 66%. </p> <p>Since 2002 the government deficit has ballooned. In 2006, an election year, the deficit would have been 12% of GDP without the fiscal adjustment package launched after the election that brought it down to 9.6%, still an incredibly large number. </p> <p>Since then, Hungary has followed an EU-approved convergence plan that has cut the budget deficit to an estimated 3.4% in 2008, at the expense of tax hikes, spending cuts, falls in real wages and slowing growth. Despite this action, Hungarian government debt increased to 66% in 2007 and is projected to rise further. Other countries in the region have much smaller debts - the figure is 29% in both the Czech Republic and Slovakia and 45% in Poland. </p> <p>While high government debt is undoubtedly a problem for Hungary, there are other serious structural weaknesses in the public sector. Government spending is more than 50% of GDP, compared with less than 40% in most other central European countries. In order to finance this high level of expenditure, taxes and other duties are extremely high in Hungary; the employment rate is one of the lowest in Europe and the potential rate of growth has slowed in recent years.</p> <p><strong>Consumers switched to foreign currency loans</strong></p> <p>The popularity of foreign currency loans has caused further problems. Since Hungarian inflation was far higher than that in the eurozone, interest rates charged on loans in the Hungarian forint were also much higher. </p> <p>So, to get lower rates, many consumers and businesses switched to foreign currency loans - 90% of new mortgage loans are now made in foreign currencies. In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, where interest rates were close to the eurozone rate, foreign currency loans only account for less than 2% of households' total.</p> <p>The Hungarian forint reached its highest level against the euro in July this year, as other countries in central and eastern Europe also peaked.</p> <p><strong>The financial crisis arrived at high speed</strong></p> <p>The global financial crisis arrived at high speed in late September this year. Many economists, including this writer, thought that the effects of the crisis on central and eastern European EU countries would not be dramatic. Our banks were not exposed to US sub-prime losses and were well capitalised. </p> <p>But it soon became clear that no country can isolate itself from the effects of this global financial crisis. With rising risk aversion and fear of contagion, investors started to sell and pull out of investments in emerging economies. </p> <p>Hungary was the hardest hit of the central European EU members because so much of its massive government debt was foreign-owned. These foreigners wanted to sell their Hungarian forint-denominated bonds but no new buyers appeared on the market. Long maturity interest rates jumped from the already high 8% to around 12% and the government bond market dried up. Auctions to issue new government bonds were unsuccessful. Hungarian blue-chips on the equity market were also heavily sold.</p> <p>Pressure on the forint intensified and last week the central bank hiked interest rates by three percentage points. The rate rise helped strengthen the forint but the situation remained fragile and the government bond market was still frozen. </p> <p><strong>Cap in hand to the IMF</strong></p> <p>It became clear that without outside help the government could face serious problems in financing its spending. It was forced to turn to the IMF and has accepted conditions that, despite a shrinking economy, it must cut expenditure and target a 2.6% deficit for 2009. So, while major economies discuss expensive plans to boost growth, Hungary has to tighten its belt.</p> <p>Hungary needed the IMF agreement to gain credibility. Since the talks concluded successfully, the forint has gained more than 8% compared to its weakest level last week. Without the agreement the forint would likely fall further, consumers with foreign currency debts would suffer, and the government would not be able to issue new debt securities.</p> <p>But what Hungary needs more than it needs the IMF are comprehensive structural reforms in its public finances that include drastic cuts in spending and tax rates. This is the only way to increase the potential rate of growth and to avoid the risks of a similar crisis in the future while outside the eurozone. </p> <p>My fear, however, is that there could come a time when the impetus for structural reforms will fade. As a side effect of the IMF program Hungary will likely meet the Maastricht criteria much sooner than previously thought. The deficit criterion will be met next year, government debt might start to fall in a few years from now, inflation will likely fall in an amplified economic downturn, and the interest rate will fall as markets would regard the euro strategy of the country credible.</p> <p>Consequently, Hungary could be in a position to introduce the euro in a few years from now. The euro would offer a shelter against contagion from possible future crises, but the joy of joining the eurozone could diminish incentives to reform. I just hope that the current crisis shakes up Hungarian politicians to think hard about the deeper structural problems of the country's economy.</p> <p>\u2022 Zsolt Darvas is visiting research fellow at Bruegel, Brussels<br><a href=\"mailto:zsolt.darvas@bruegel.org\">zsolt.darvas@bruegel.org</a></p>",
  "<p>The financial crisis has unexpectedly come to the rescue of Gordon Brown and of the Labour government, in chaos and seemingly doomed only two months ago. The collapse of a financial sector hitherto seen as the vanguard of the economy, and the emergence of the active state \u2013 even public ownership \u2013 as the unavoidable solution to catastrophic problems, gives one a strange sense of exhilaration in the midst of the economic gloom. An insufferable conventional wisdom, asserting that global markets are now sovereign, and that all politics must adapt to what they demand, has broken into pieces, in a few short weeks. The lid has come off, Keynes and Galbraith are back in fashion, there is, momentarily at least, space to think anew about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/28/economics-labour-conservatives-keynes\">what might be possible</a>.</p> <p>The new situation poses a problem for Labour, however. It cannot just change its ideological spots, having so much responsibility for what has happened, and having put so much conviction into the New Labour politics of the last 10 years. New Labour is not now going to mutate back again into old Labour, and probably would make itself a sitting duck in electoral terms if it did so. </p> <p>But the theory of globalisation which has underpinned so much of New Labour's programme of marketisation over the past decade \u2013 this was the intellectual heart of the unloved <a href=\"http://www.polity.co.uk/book.asp?ref=9780745622675\">Third Way</a> \u2013 turns out to have another dimension, and one which Gordon Brown can claim he has always understood better than most. \"Globalisation\" is indeed the accelerating flow of investment, finance and trade, the competitive economy which was, until last month at least, driving economic growth not only in Britain, but also in the large emerging economies of China, India, Brazil and South Africa. But it is also a system which has shown itself capable of sudden meltdown and collapse, with potential consequences like those last seen in the 1930s. The globalised world is now shown urgently to need intergovernmental action and regulation, new democratic institutions on a global scale (for example, the G8 turned into a G12 or G20) and a more coherent international banking system. Unregulated markets, we now see, have led to near-disaster, and to a significant recession, at the very least. Gordon Brown has, at least briefly, in the recapitalisation of the banks, shown that he can be a decisive voice in such actions. At home, there is urgent need for government to protect the many citizens now at risk.</p> <p>Unconstrained growth driven by markets is also leading to the destruction of the global climate. At the same moment as New Labour has woken up to the necessity for a stronger economic state, it seems also to have recognised the need to take climate change seriously, with Ed Miliband's appointment to the new department for energy and climate change, and his promising announcements on carbon reduction targets and the feed-in tariff. One can at least now imagine a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/17/globaleconomy-banking \">Green New Deal</a>, a programme of economic rescue in which the protection of the climate is central. A more radical programme could now be gathered together as globalisation's other imperative, as the construction of the new global democratic institutions and actions which are needed if the destructiveness of markets is to be contained and their potential for good realised.</p> <p><em>\"After New Labour\", the second debate in the \"Who owns the progressive future?\" series, organised by Comment is free &amp; Soundings journal, will take place in London at Kings Place on November 3 at 7pm.

  "<p>It might have been Russell Brand's radio show where they made the now-notorious prank call, but this story is all about his co-conspirator. If Brand's chuckling sidekick had been a lesser name from the comedy circuit rather than the demi-god figure of Jonathan Ross, <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/latest/2008/10/28/jonathan-ross-and-russell-brand-face-probe-over-manuelgate-prank-phone-calls-115875-20848966/\">Manuelgate</a> would not have made the front page of the <a href=\"http://www.mailonsunday.co.uk/mailonsunday/index.html\">Mail on Sunday</a> and most certainly would not have ended up on the floor of the House of Commons.</p> <p>But it's the involvement of Ross \u2013 combined with a stack of other touchstone issues that I'll come to in a moment \u2013 that has caused this story to knock the global financial meltdown off the front pages and will engage us until the United States decides to elect or reject its first black presidential candidate.</p> <p>The reason is this. A couple of years ago, Ross signed a contract with the BBC that turned out to be worth \u00a318 million over three years. Even by showbiz standards, that's a load of lolly. When the scale of the deal was revealed, most of Soho choked on its mojitos.</p> <p>The deal prompted outrage not just among the usual suspects, but within the BBC itself. And it led to an investigation into the salaries of top stars by no lesser body than the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Trust\">BBC Trust</a> \u2013 a fudge of an organisation that is supposed to regulate the corporation on behalf of the licence fee payer, but which is being out-manoeuvred at every turn by an ambitious and dynamic commercial regulatory rival, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofcom\">Ofcom</a>. The report failed to lay the issue to rest, and it has been rumbling on in the background ever since.</p> <p>The trouble is, Ross has become a lightening rod for the complaints of anyone who wishes the BBC were not as successful, or aggressive, or overbearing as it is. </p> <p>The corporation's commercial radio rivals detest the success of Radio 2 \u2013 which has come largely at their expense \u2013 and feel that the BBC has outbid them for talent such as Ross who should rightfully be theirs.</p> <p>Associated Newspapers, owners of the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday, detest the BBC because it embodies everything they hate about modern Britain \u2013 liberal, public service, populist, coarse and celebrity-obsessed (yes, that's the same Mail group that splashed pictures of Andrew Sachs' burlesque-dancer granddaughter in bra and pants all over its website).</p> <p>The Sun and the Times are happy to fall in behind the Mail titles because the BBC is a direct rival to BSkyB, in which the papers' parent company News Corporation has a controlling stake. And most newspapers are now in direct competition with the BBC, which outguns their online incarnations by running the biggest text-based news website in the world, all funded by public money, naturally.</p> <p>Gordon Brown and David Cameron, meanwhile, have intervened because it takes the heat off their respective problems in relation to the economy.</p> <p>But while Ross is the main reason why this story has gone stratospheric, it's not the only one. It embodies not just one, but a whole clutch of issues that have proved toxic for the BBC in the past. </p> <p>Manuelgate disinters the issue of audience trust that the BBC thought it had buried with the sacking last year of Peter Fincham as controller of BBC1 over the misrepresentation of the Queen. It raises the issue of the coarsening of broadcasting culture that has broadened out from the ravings of the Mary Whitehouse brigade and into a broader sociological debate. It speaks to the political debate of whether part of the BBC licence fee should be shared with other broadcasters \u2013 an issue on which Ofcom will soon give its opinion. It takes in \"national treasure\" Andrew Sachs. And to the delight of the tabloids and their website editors, the grand-daughter whose honour had been called into question by Brand and Ross turned out to be a not-so-cherubic member of the dance troupe Satanic Sluts, complete with a photographically enhanced MySpace page. </p> <p>Capping off this story's status as a parable of our times, it is revealed that Max Clifford negotiated the sale of the grand-daughter's story to the Murdoch-owned Sun, to which she complained of how her grandfather \"is really upset\" and \"wants the whole situation to end\" \u2013 ensuring, with her interview and accompanying video \u2013 that it will drag on for another few days at least. </p> <p>Today, Ross and Brand have been suspended. Brand's career is on the way up; this will do him no harm. But the Radio 2 controller Lesley Douglas \u2013 who is the subject of speculation about whether she was the \"senior editorial figure\" who approved the pre-recorded prank for broadcast \u2013 was grooming Ross to succeed Terry Wogan as presenter of the station's top-rating breakfast show. Now, with the jobs of Douglas and Ross hanging in the balance, Britain is to be denied that particular pleasure.</p> <p>Be thankful for small mercies.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was changed at 6.30pm on October 29 to make it clear that News Corporation has a controlling stake in BSkyB, but does not own it.</p>",

It is also considering buying stakes in Austrian Airways and Italy's Alitalia.</p> <p>In its third-quarter results today, Lufthansa said Bishop exercised a \"put option\" for his stake of 50%, plus one share, in BMI on 10 October. The transaction is expected to be completed by January 12.</p> <p>BMI can trace its origins back to 1938 and acquired the name British Midland in 1964, later changed to BMI. Last year, the airline carried 10.6 million passengers, and it flies to 51 destinations using a fleet of 51 planes. </p> <p>Lufthansa flew 83.1 million passengers last year and operates to 209 destinations with a fleet of 276 planes. </p> <p>Dr Ashley Steel, the global chair for transport and infrastructure at KPMG, said: \"This is a much welcome next stage in the restructuring process of the European airline industry. This reinforces that airlines are no longer national in the true sense of the word or can be run on a national basis.</p> <p>\"The global economic downturn will intensify the industry crisis and the need for consolidation in the airline sector. The time has come to abolish rules that restrict foreign investors to only a limited stake in most airlines. </p> <p>\"As we have seen in the banking sector, a global economy needs international regulation and now it's time for the airline industry to abolish country-by-country rules.\"</p>",
  "<p>If eight companies across a broad spectrum of UK industry had warned, five years ago, that a ruinous credit crunch would hit the global economy this year, might the government have taken the warning seriously? Might UK leadership in damage limitation have been proactive, rather than reactive? Could a softer landing and a faster recovery have been possible as a result?</p> <p>Today, eight British companies are warning of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/29/fossil-fuels-oil\">ruinous oil crunch five years from now</a>. We warn that the global peak of oil production will arrive unexpectedly early, resulting in not just a global energy crisis, but potentially the withholding of exports by oil producers and energy famine in oil-importing countries. Previously unimaginable policy interventions in financial markets have suddenly become imperative, and similar interventions in energy markets today may be worth their weight in gold tomorrow, in terms of economic and social damage avoided, especially as this would also help tackle climate change.</p> <p>The prevailing oil industry view, echoed by the government, is that there are well over a trillion barrels of proved reserves, and several trillions more in tar sands. In a world burning just over 30bn barrels a year, that means decades of supply before we need worry. But peak oil happens when flow-rate capacity coming onstream from oil discoveries fails to exceed declining flow-rate capacity from depletion of existing reserves. Peak oil is as much a problem of flow rates as it is of reserves. In our report, the consulting editor of Petroleum Review \u2013 a flagship oil-industry journal \u2013 shows how the flow rates from reported discoveries will drop below depletion rates no later than 2013, and possibly a good deal earlier. </p> <p>As for tar sands, operators have to melt the tar. This is far from easy, and is far slower than lifting liquid crude out of the ground. Easy oil is being depleted by at least 3.5m barrels a day of capacity each year, and seven years from now the oil industry won't be able to squeeze more than 2.5m barrels of capacity from the tar sands, even if all goes to plan and the industry isn't reined in because mining tar sands creates huge greenhouse gas emissions. Think of global oil reserves as a water tank: if the tap is faulty, you won't get enough water out. We fear the oil tap is faulty.</p> <p>But, some will say, demand has been falling fast since oil hit $147, and that will head off the problem. It is true that the transport sector is changing, and it shows the scope we have for cutting global energy demand and changing supply if we try. But there are problems with relying on this market mechanism. </p> <p>First, continuing growth in demand in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/india\">India</a> is likely to drown out any reduction in demand from structural changes in the west. Second, the oil industry has \u2013 almost incomprehensibly \u2013 been investing less in exploration in recent years. Too much of the vast profit we saw from BP earlier this week goes on share buybacks. Third, the industry is relying on aged oilfields, aged infrastructure and an aged workforce just at the time when oilfields are becoming more difficult to find and are taking ever longer \u2014 sometimes more than a decade \u2014 to bring onstream even when found. Fourth, the oil- and gas-producing nations have massive and growing infrastructure programmes that increasingly cut into their scope for export. Fifth, we worry that Opec has been subject to the same irrational exuberance about delivery capacity as the international oil companies have been.</p> <p>If we accelerate the green industrial revolution, we believe we can soften the blow of the oil crunch, set up the recovery and get out of oil dependence surprisingly quickly. We hope industry and government can plan for an industrial green new deal, starting now.</p>",
  "<p>The posh, monster <a href=\"http://uk.westfield.com/london/\">Westfield shopping mall</a> opens tomorrow in Shepherd's Bush with who knows what consequences for the competition, from Oxford Street to Bluewater to those smaller west London traders praying for an end to the c-charge zone's western extension. I've driven past the site dozens of times in recent months when heading home from visiting my mum, noting its slow evolution from girders-and-concrete skeleton into a mighty retail edifice on the point of being unveiled.</p> <p>I've mixed feelings about these palaces of shopping. At one level I'm drawn to their luxury, their kitsch and their outrageous decadence. At another, I'm appalled by their grand vacuity. But such seductive confidence! From <a href=\"http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/retailing/article4996254.ece\">the Times</a>: </p> <blockquote> <p>Under the eco-conscious glass roof sit 265 outlets from Top Shop to Tiffany \u2013 a name more high-end than the mall norm. Similar shops, such as children's wear, are grouped together, to lessen the stress that causes a shopping trip to be curtailed. There are no food courts (a bit downmarket) but 50 restaurants on three levels of dining, including the Southern Terrace, a street lined with caf\u00e9s. Sitting there, it would be easy to pretend that you had not broken your vow not to go shopping at all. </p> </blockquote> <p>And from <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7682815.stm\">the BBC</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>KPMG retail analyst Helen Dickinson says it could face a tough first year or two. However, she stresses that the developer is in it \"for the long term\" - and that Westfield has advantages over older developments.<br>\"Lessons learnt with earlier centres - some of which can tend to be ghost towns after 6pm - have persuaded developers to make these schemes more vibrant,\" she says.</p> <p>\"At Westfield there are a range of upmarket bars and restaurants, which will be open until midnight, while a 14-screen cinema, gym and spa are planned for 2009.\" Ms Dickinson also argues that \"lifestyle and demographic changes\" mean consumers now see shopping as a leisure pursuit, and the more pleasant the environment, the longer visitors will stay and the more they will spend.</p> </blockquote> <p>Is resistance futile?</p>",
  "<p>One of America's more prolific novelists - his latest, Man in the Dark, is his 12th, and he's no slouch as a poet, non-fiction author, screenwriter and editor - but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/paulauster\">Paul Auster</a> is not feeling very inspired today. \"I'm completely emptied out,\" he says, \"no thoughts in my head. No ideas. I am back to zero.\"</p> <p>Zero apparently equals being \"just your average everyday neurotic\", but he's not showing much of a complex about the creative blank, sitting happily smoking a chain of cigarillos in Faber's London offices. (He clearly isn't unduly anxious about breaking the anti-smoking laws, either.) </p> <p>If there is something getting Auster's goat, it's American politics. It was his disgust at the outcome of the 2000 US elections that sparked the story-within-a-story at the heart of Man in the Dark, about a counterfactual US where civil war reigns and New York leads a movement to form the Independent States of America.</p> <p>\"It's a war of bullets and bombs, whereas the divisions in the US now are similar to a civil war, but we're fighting it with words and ideas,\" he says.</p> <p>He can pinpoint the idea for his latest story to his \"frustration and disgust after the 2000 elections ... Gore won, Gore was elected president, and it was taken away from him by political and legal manoeuvering, and ever since then I've had this eerie feeling of being in some parallel world, some world we didn't ask for but we nevertheless got. In the other world Al Gore is finishing his second term now, we never invaded Iraq, maybe 9/11 never happened, because they were getting close to figuring it out, the Clinton people, and then the Bush people ignored all the warnings, so I think that's the origin of it.\"</p> <p>Man in the Dark centres on ageing book critic August Brill, who as he struggles with another night of insomnia, \"another white night in the great American wilderness\", tells himself a story about Owen Brick, a man catapulted from his life as a magician in today's New York into civil war. In a twist typical of Auster, Brick is given a mission to kill the man who brought about the civil war (\"He invented it, and everything that happens or is about to happen is in his head\"). His name, he learns, is August Brill.</p> <p>The layering of narrative is a particular pleasure for Auster, for whom \"stories generate other stories in the same way thoughts generate other thoughts\". Think Quinn, the protagonist in City of Glass from Auster's most famous work, The New York Trilogy, who not only pretends to be Paul Auster but meets the \"real\" Paul Auster. Or the narrator of Oracle Night ,who's writing a story of his own based on a story told in The Maltese Falcon. Or the novelist Peter in Leviathan, who is married to Iris (a backwards spelling of Siri, the first name of Auster's famous spouse, novelist Siri Hustvedt).</p> <p>\"I've always been interested in turning the process inside out, exposing the plumbing so to speak, not covering up the walls,\" he says. \"I guess there's a certain kind of interiority that one can achieve if a protagonist is thinking about how he's going to tell the thing he's telling. It's self-reflexive. But it's all instinctive.\" </p> <p>The process of writing Man in the Dark was, Auster says, unusual for him. It took just four months, faster than any other book he's written. \"It was one of those odd situations where the next word was always there,\" he says. \"There was Brill, lying in bed, and little by little you slip into the skin of this other being, and find out who he is, and the novel starts to emerge out of this.\"</p> <p>As well as Auster's rage at America, the story has its roots in a very personal tragedy: the book is dedicated to Israeli writer David Grossman, a good friend of Auster's, and to the memory of Uri Grossman, David's son, who was killed in Lebanon two summers ago, aged 20.</p> <p>As Brill lies awake through the night, he worries about his granddaughter Katya, \"who used to sleep with a young man named Titus Small, but Titus is dead now, and Katya sleeps alone with her broken heart.\"</p> <p>\"The devastation [Uri Grossman's] death has caused in the family is incalculable. I think I was so horrified by this that the character of Titus is in a way a personal response to that,\" says Auster, who feels the Grossman's tragedy was perhaps \"the central event of the book around which everything else accumulated\". \"Of all people, David has been fighting for peace in the Middle East all his life, and his son was killed roughly 24 hours after he and Amos Oz and other Israeli writers implored Olmert to declare a ceasefire. It was bad, it was really bad.\"</p> <p>We don't learn until the end of the novel how Titus has died but the brutal nature of his death in Iraq - \"the horrifying story of that death ... the pulverizing consequences\" - is presaged early on. \"They are haunted by those pictures, that's why Katya's watching movies all day, because she wants to flood herself with other images, in the same way that Brill is telling all his stories so that he can evade thinking about his own problems. So there are two forms of evasion really going on,\" Auster says.</p> <p>As Auster/Brill ponders the nature of war, Brill reflects upon other stories - his own marriage, his life, his wife, and more tales of war and public mayhem, including the Newark race riots of 1967, which Auster experienced himself aged 20, one summer night after a dinner in Manhattan.</p> <p>\"We did get into car, did hear the police calls, did drive straight in to Newark, went through the streets where this mayhem was erupting all round us, did go to City Hall and did see the mayor who was crying at his desk,\" Auster says. \"We did go down to jail under City Hall and see all the beaten up men, and I did see that colonel from New Jersey state police say these terrible things about wanting to kill every black bastard in the city. It was horrifying. So those two pages or so come out of my own life.\"</p> <p>It's the closest he himself has come to war. \"Not a real war, perhaps,\" Brill says in the book, \"but once you witness violence on that scale, it isn't difficult to imagine something worse, and once your mind is capable of doing that, you understand that the worst possibilities of the imagination are the country you live in.\"</p> <p>It's the only autobiographical passage in the book, says Auster - unlike Brill he's not an insomniac, but like everyone has had sleepless nights. \"It's a dark night for Brill. But I think that most people when they have these bouts of insomnia - I think we've all had them - usually your thoughts turn to the darker moments of your life. It's not a cheery time, the experience of cataloguing your regrets, making lists of all the rotten things you've done in life, things you wish you haven't done, basically just examining the futility of your own existence. It usually gets better when morning comes, and I try to imply that at the end of the book.\"</p> <p>Auster writes in a little apartment about three blocks from the house he shares with his wife (Hustvedt has \"a very nice room\" on the top floor of their house where she works: \"I think it's better for both of us to be apart during the day.\"). Only three people have the telephone number so no one can distract him, \"and there's nothing to do there but work, it's a very spartan environment.\" He's told me earlier that on the wall is the framed cover of a poetry magazine, sent to him by a friend a couple of months after 9/11, which is headlined \"USA out of NYC\". </p> <p>Writing by hand in notebooks, he'll revise paragraph by paragraph until he's happy with what he's done (there were fewer corrections for Man in the Dark, he adds, than in his other novels). </p> <p>\"For me a paragraph in a novel is a bit like a line in a poem. It has its own shape, its own music, its own integrity,\" he says. \"I write the paragraph, then I'm crossing out, changing words, trying to improve it. When it seems more or less OK then I type it up, because sometimes it's almost illegible and if I wait I might not be able to read it the next day. So I immediately type up the paragraph, see what it looks like on a clean sheet of paper, and then attack that sheet of paper with my pencil again.\"</p> <p>He's already written his next novel, which he'll reveal is called Invisible and has a 20-year-old protagonist (\"no more old men in rooms for the time being\"). It's out next year, but for now he seems to content to watch as \"the weird world rolls on\", to borrow a phrase from Nathaniel Hawthorne's daughter Rose which resounds through Man in the Dark.</p> <p>He's hoping something will emerge shortly. \"When I'm writing I don't feel neurotic,\" he says with a grin. \"So it's better for the family if I'm working.\"</p>",
  "<p>Lord Mandelson hailed a thaw in relations between Britain and Russia today as he wound up a four-day visit to Moscow.</p> <p>Diplomatic spats that poisoned ties between the two countries in the last two years seemed to be swept under the carpet as the business secretary lauded a new climate of partnership. </p> <p>\"I hope my visit will intensify a thawing of the difficult political relationship that we have experienced,\" Mandelson told reporters at the British embassy.</p> <p>Relations between Britain and Russia reached a post-cold war low in the wake of the murder of former KGB officer Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006. </p> <p>Britain ejected four Russian diplomats when Moscow refused to hand over the chief suspect in the murder last year. Ties dipped further this summer when the west confronted Russia over its invasion of Georgia.</p> <p>Earlier this month Britain's incoming ambassador to Moscow, Anne Pringle, called on Russia to extradite Andrei Lugovoi, the Russian businessman turned politician who is suspected of poisoning Litvinenko.</p> <p>But Mandelson struck a much more conciliatory tone during his visit, admitting Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, had been the first to mention the Litvinenko case during their meeting on Monday.</p> <p>He stressed there was a desire on both sides to \"smooth our relationship\", work together to withstand the global financial crisis and maximise business partnerships in areas such as energy and nanotechnology. </p> <p>And in an apparent climbdown Mandelson told the Russian newspaper Kommersant today that the Kremlin's foreign policy interests had to be taken into account.</p> <p>When Russia invaded Georgia in August in response to the bombing of South Ossetia by Georgian forces, the UK Foreign Office responded with tough rhetoric condemning Moscow's actions. However Mandelson struck a new note today, saying: \"We have to recognise that Russia is especially sensitive when it comes to questions concerning its near abroad and plans for the expansion of Nato \u2026 There must be a mutual acceptance of each other's interests.\"</p> <p>Earlier Mandelson praised the recent decision by a Russian court to scale down tax bills demanded from the British Council, which was targeted by the Kremlin in the fallout from the Litvinenko affair.</p> <p>The business secretary refused point blank to answer questions concerning his meetings with the Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska.</p> <p>Mandelson has admitted meeting the metals magnate on several occasions since 2004 before and after he became EU trade commissioner, but refused to elaborate on what they discussed. He denies that Deripaska lobbied him to lower aluminium tariffs.</p> <p>Mandelson's visit to Russia was the first by a British cabinet minister since early 2007.</p>",
  "<p>Shares in the Ukraine-focused mining company <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/ferrexpo\">Ferrexpo</a></strong> dived by almost a third today after it warned that sales would fall and announced the departure of its chief executive.</p> <p>The Swiss-based iron ore specialist said Kostyantin Zhevago, a director connected with its majority shareholder, would take over the running of the company.</p> <p>Ferrexpo said a slowdown in demand would depress sales by 5% to 10%.</p> <p>\"The group has been notified of materially reduced demand for iron ore pellets by a number of its export contract customers for the remainder of the year due to a significant reduction in both steel demand and output,\" the FTSE 250 company said in a trading update. </p> <p>\"As a result these customers have requested deferral of some Q4 2008 planned deliveries into 2009.

  "<p>The risk to the UK from falling oil production in coming years is greater than the threat posed by terrorism, according to an industry taskforce report published today.</p> <p>The report, from the Peak Oil group, warns that the problem of declining availability of oil will hit the UK earlier than generally expected - possibly within the next five years and as early as 2011. </p> <p>Oil supply could then rapidly decline, or even collapse, the report warns, with potentially devastating implications for the UK economy. </p> <p>The report was issued today by the recently established UK industry taskforce on peak oil and energy security, a group of eight companies including transport firms Virgin, Stagecoach and FirstGroup, engineers Arup, architects Foster and Partners, and energy giant Scottish and Southern.</p> <p>Entitled The Oil Crunch, the report argues that the risk of an early peak in oil production poses a bigger threat to UK society than tightening gas supplies, terrorism or the short-term impacts of climate change.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-366016293\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2008/10/30/Oil-production.gif\" alt=\"Oil production\" width=\"222\" height=\"247\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oil production</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br>The \"peak oil\" debate has raged for many years. Some governments and oil companies believe that crude oil production will meet rising demand for decades to come. But an increasingly vocal group - including many experts from within the oil industry - claim that a production peak is imminent.</p> <p>The new report marks the first time a group of businesses has weighed into this debate. At its core are two newly commissioned assessments of future oil production: one from Chris Skrebowski, consulting editor of Petroleum Review, and one from Shell.</p> <p>Skrebowski predicts that global oil production will peak in the period 2011-2013 and then decline steadily, with non-conventional sources such as tar sands failing to fill the gap in time to avoid a serious energy crunch. He also warns that supplies could collapse if a handful of huge, long-established oil fields go into terminal decline simultaneously.</p> <p>Shell, by contrast, foresees oil production rising until 2015, and then remaining on a plateau until the 2020s, with unconventional sources balancing out a decline in regular crude extraction.</p> <p>Having examined the evidence, the taskforce considers that Skrebowski's peak-and-fall scenario is the \"highly probable\" outcome, with the collapse scenario also possible.</p> <p>This view contrasts starkly with the position of the British government. A statement from the new Department of Energy and Climate Change reiterates the government's established view on this issue.</p> <p>\"The government's assessment is that global proven reserves are larger than the cumulative production needed to meet rising demand until at least 2030,\" the statement says. \"This is consistent with the assessment made by the International Energy Agency in its 2007 World Energy Outlook that lead to the conclusion that global oil resources are adequate for the foreseeable future.\"</p>",

  "<p>The escalating crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo's eastern region of <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=17886\">North Kivu</a> is chillingly reminiscent of the war that first erupted there 10 years ago. </p> <p>Between 1998 and 2002, we witnessed one of the worst conflicts ever recorded. Armed groups in search of political power and economic control over Congo's immense natural resources and backed by the Congolese, Rwandan and Ugandan governments, manipulated tensions and land disputes between ethnic groups to the point where a brutal and bloody war became inevitable. </p> <p>Hundreds of thousands of people were killed in some of the most horrific ways \u2013 many were hacked to death with machetes and hand-axes. Tens of thousands fled their homes in a desperate bid to survive. </p> <p>Despite various peace agreements signed between 2002 and 2008, eastern Congo has been plagued by ongoing instability and simmering ethnic and political tensions. </p> <p>Fast-forward 10 years, and once again a dreadful and brutal conflict is looming across the horizon of the verdant mountainous region of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/29/congo-unitednations\">North Kivu</a>. </p> <p>In recent months, armed violence has broken out between rebel armed groups \u2013 primarily, but not exclusively, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/oct/28/congo-fighting-nkunda\">Rwandese General Laurent Nkunda</a>'s forces (FDLR) \u2013 and government armed forces. </p> <p>And once again, it has resulted in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2008/oct/28/congo-unitednations?picture=339065168\">hundreds of thousands of civilians</a> being caught in the crossfire. </p> <p>Just last month <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=17886\">Amnesty reported</a> how thousands of children are being forced to take up weapons and fight; while women and girls \u2013 some as young as six \u2013 have been raped or exposed to other forms of sexual abuse. </p> <p>The people there are struggling to survive in an environment already fractured and brutalised by previous wars \u2013 can they really withstand the abuses from another war? Or perhaps the question should be \u2013 should they have to? </p> <p>Now more than ever the international community has to deliver concrete measures to protect these people from further human rights abuses. International pressure must be applied to all parties of the conflict to stop all attacks on the general population. </p> <p>The UN Security Council has to make eastern Congo their top priority as they meet over the coming weeks and months. </p> <p>And in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the UN's peacekeeping force already stationed in the country \u2013 Monuc \u2013 must be given the adequate resources and equipment needed to ensure that they are able to effectively protect civilians, and to disrupt any armed group attacks against local communities. There should also be a clear plan of evacuation in place for the people living in dangerous zones. </p> <p>Millions of Congolese people have already endured a decade of insecurity, unrest and displacement. The prospect for the next 10 years simply should not be the same as the last.</p>",
  "<p>In recent years technology giants Microsoft, Yahoo and Google have been widely criticised for their business practices in repressive countries such as China. But yesterday the trio tackled their critics by joining a new scheme to help protect <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/censorship\">the freedoms of internet users</a> around the world. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.globalnetworkinitiative.org\">The Global Network Initiative</a>, a new human rights coalition, says it is working to help companies stand up to authoritarian governments in countries such as China, Vietnam, Syria, Burma and Iran.</p> <p>As well as the triumvirate of hi-tech companies, the group is also being backed by a wide range of campaigners and academic organisations, including <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/\">Human Rights Watch</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.eff.org/\">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>. The initiative aims to \"protect and advance user rights to freedom of expression and privacy\".</p> <p>The initiative's backers said it is more important than ever for technology companies to understand their role in protecting users around the world.</p> <p>\"The number of states actively seeking to censor online content and access personal information is growing,\" said <a href=\"http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/cmaclay\">Colin Maclay of the Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard Law School</a>, one of the initiative's signatories. </p> <p>\"A strong code of conduct for companies embodies the most promising approach to dilemmas that neither national law nor international regulation can effectively resolve at this time.\"</p> <p>The companies joining the initiative have agreed to follow a list of principles, including a commitment to consider fighting unwarranted government demands in the courts.</p> <p>The support from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/google\">Google</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/microsoft\">Microsoft</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/yahoo\">Yahoo</a> denotes a remarkable turnaround for the three technology giants, which have all faced criticism over their human rights records. </p> <p>Microsoft was accused of capitulating to Beijing for its censorship of Chinese blogs, while Google faced a barrage of attacks after it decided to launch a censored version of its search engine index in China in 2006. </p> <p>However, it is Yahoo that has faced the most condemnation, in particular after it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/nov/14/news.yahoo\">handed the Chinese government details that led to the imprisonment of dissident journalist Shi Tao in 2004</a>.</p> <p>Tao is now serving a 10-year prison sentence for passing on a briefing document from the Chinese government to an American campaign group. He emailed the file - which explained how Beijing officials were ordering journalists not to write about the 15th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre \u2013 from a Yahoo account, which was then traced back to him with the company's assistance.</p> <p>Last year Yahoo made a private settlement with the family of Tao and another journalist, but chief executive Jerry Yang said in a statement on the new initiative that he wanted to make sure that the company's \"actions match our values\". </p> <p>\"These principles provide a valuable roadmap for companies like Yahoo operating in markets where freedom of expression and privacy are unfairly restricted. Through the collective efforts of industry, advocates and government, we will continue to see technology and the internet as a way to improve people's lives,\" said the statement.</p> <p>The coalition also represents a truce between campaign groups and technology industry leaders, which have had testy relationships in the past. Human Rights Watch, in particular, had accused companies of having attitudes that were \"arbitrary, opaque and unaccountable\", and argued that technology corporations should be among the last to succumb to government demands.</p> <p>\"It was ironic that companies whose existence depends on freedom of information and expression have taken on the role of censor,\" said the group in 2006.</p>",
  "<p>Contrary to published reports, the presidential election won't happen until November 4. Those hundreds of thousands of robo-calls, the blizzard of TV ads, or other unforeseen events could propel a Republican team to the White House, leaving president-elect John McCain to assemble a cabinet to run the government. (See Barack Obama's potential green team <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/30/network\">here</a>)</p> <p>The global economic crisis, for the moment, is dominating the headlines, but there is no doubt the next president will have to grapple with daunting energy and environmental issues fairly quickly once in office. For starters, fuel prices could careen upward again, and a post-Kyoto summit between 189 countries to hash out new greenhouse-gas reduction targets is set for Copenhagen in late 2009. </p> <p>McCain would need to decide quickly whom he would trust to navigate his climate, energy, and conservation policies through the tricky shoals of environmental groups, powerful Democrats in Congress, conservative Republicans, and industry barons. Not to mention the leaders of rapidly developing China and India ...</p> <p>So who would staff a McCain administration's environmental posts? Grand Old Party (GOP) Republican insiders, industry lobbyists, and think tankers talked to Grist about names being mentioned for a McCain government.</p> <h2>Secretary of Energy</h2> <p><strong>Pete Domenici</strong><br>Right-wingers who still challenge global warming, or at least linking it to human activities, say they don't have a glacier's chance in hell of being heard in a McCain administration on energy. But if they did, they'd pick Sen. Pete Domenici (R-N.M.) to lead the Department of Energy. Domenici, New Mexico's retiring elder statesman, is a backer of nuclear power who's a favorite among conservatives and industry groups, but they acknowledge he probably wouldn't get the nod. Politically, Domenici's tangential involvement in the U.S. attorneys firings wouldn't help him win confirmation, but more practically, he announced last year that he's suffering from a degenerative brain disease.</p> <p><strong>Heather Wilson</strong><br>Another New Mexican who gets mentioned is Rep. Heather Wilson (R), a Domenici prot\u00e9g\u00e9 who lost the GOP primary this year to run for Domenici's seat. McCain, who is pushing construction of nuclear power plants, might find Wilson hard to dismiss. Women and minorities are often traditionally picked for Cabinet posts. A former Rhodes Scholar, she has served on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, where she supported nuclear energy, and on the Select Committee on Intelligence, which monitors nuclear weapons. Her district is home to the Sandia National Laboratories, and she is an Air Force veteran. \"From her background in national security, she knows the nuclear issues that make up much of Energy's jurisdiction,\" said Jack Pitney, politics professor at Claremont McKenna College.</p> <p>But environmentalists and others might fight her appointment. Wilson voted to scrap critical habitat for endangered species, and against a multimillion conservation fund that New Mexico farmers backed. The League of Conservation Voters put her on its \"Dirty Dozen\" list in 2002, citing her support for uranium industry practices that contaminate groundwater, and for mining company polluters.</p> <p><strong>James Inhofe</strong><br>Under their breath, industry groups invoke Sen. Jim Inhofe's (R-Okla.) name for this post. But it's hard to see an expanded Democratic Senate majority voting to confirm one of the most outspoken climate-change skeptics.</p> <h2>Environmental Protection Agency Administrator</h2> <p>The nation's top pollution cop, the EPA's mission is to protect human health and the environment under the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Superfund law, and other regulations. Many career staff, scientists, and environmentalists say that under Stephen Johnson that mission has been impossible to carry out, citing his refusal to quickly act on a U.S. Supreme Court order to evaluate greenhouse gases as a public risk, among other decisions. Industry groups say he's gotten a bad rap, but know the winds of change are blowing.</p> <p>\"I think industry groups are all going to have concerns about anybody McCain will pick. In my mind it's going to be Lieberman, or somebody like that,\" said Frank Maisano, an energy specialist at the law firm of Bracewell &amp; Giuliani (yes, that Giuliani). \"Somebody like Sherry Boehlert who's a real champion of the environment.\"</p> <p><strong>Sherwood Boehlert</strong><br>Sherwood Boehlert, who retired last year after 24 years as a New York congressman, is still widely respected by Washington insiders as a consummate moderate Republican. He spent his entire career on the House Science Committee and is best known for his environmental policy work, including helping to design a pioneering cap-and-trade program to control acid rain, fighting for higher fuel-economy standards, and pushing to fund science and math education. He currently sits on the board of the bipartisan Alliance for Climate Protection, headed by former vice president Al Gore. </p> <p><strong>Joe Lieberman</strong><br>Many feel that Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) deserves his pick of plum administration jobs for faithful support of his Senate colleague. As coauthor with McCain of Congress' first attempt at a cap-and-trade program for greenhouse-gas emissions, he could make a good EPA administrator - or perhaps energy secretary.</p> <p><strong>Christopher Shays</strong><br>Rep. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.) shares McCain's positions on many environmental issues, including developing wind, geothermal, and biofuel energy, exploring for oil off the coast, and building new nuclear plants. He coauthored a bipartisan bill to improve vehicle fuel efficiency, promote renewable energy, and repeal some tax breaks for fossil-fuel industries.</p> <p><strong>William Reilly</strong><br>William Reilly, a longtime director at DuPont and former president of the World Wildlife Fund, is an investment capitalist who still wins kudos for his tenure at EPA under the first President Bush. In 2007, he pulled off a coup through the leveraged buyout of TXU, which reduced plans for a dozen new coal-fired power plants to three. </p> <p><strong>Christine Todd Whitman</strong><br>Christine Todd Whitman, the former New Jersey governor and later EPA administrator during much of George W. Bush's first term, is a woman who could deliver the message loudly that a McCain administration would not be the same as a Bush administration when it comes to energy and the environment.</p> <p><strong>Mary Gade</strong><br>Mary Gade said she was forced to quit as EPA administrator in the Midwest after tangling with Dow Chemical Co. over dioxin contamination. She is seen by many as a poster child for current agency abuses. She's also a Republican and corporate attorney who understands how EPA works.</p> <p><strong>David McIntosh</strong><br>Conservatives say David McIntosh, a Newt Gingrich Republican who gave up his House seat for an unsuccessful run for Indiana governor back in 2000, would be dandy, while environmentalists say he would be a doozy. McIntosh, now a D.C. law partner, served as executive director of former vice president Dan Quayle's Council for Competitiveness, where he worked to roll back environmental regulations and push a rewrite of the Clean Air Act that would allow polluters to increase emissions without notifying the public.</p> <h2>Secretary of Agriculture</h2> <p>This position executes farming and ranching policy (obviously), promoting agricultural production and trade. But it also administers ethanol subsidies and handles food safety and hunger prevention, including the food-stamp and organic-food-labeling programs. And don't forget that the Forest Service falls under this department, overseeing nearly 300,000 square miles of national forests.</p> <p><strong>Calvin Dooley</strong><br>Conservatives and industry representatives say if McCain is serious about appointing Democrats to high posts, this would be a good spot. They drool over Calvin Dooley, a former Democratic congressman from California's Central Valley who understands agribusiness issues. He was previously head of the Food Products Association and the Grocery Manufacturers Association, two major food-industry trade groups, and he's currently CEO of the American Chemistry Council. But he may be making too nice of a salary at his new job to be lured away for government service.</p> <p><strong>James Leach</strong><br>Some environmentalists, on the other hand, see a Republican they like. Jim Leach, a 30-year Iowa congressman who was defeated in 2006, is now interim director of Harvard's Institute of Politics, on leave from Princeton where he's a professor of public and international affairs. He \"was very much interested in reform and good government, and would not be susceptible to the kinds of political pressures brought to bear on farm policy,\" said Jim DiPeso, policy director for Republicans for Environmental Protection. But that endorsement speech Leach gave for Obama at the Democratic National Convention might dim his chances, not to mention his current job as leader of the campaign finance reform group Common Cause.</p> <p><strong>Ben Nelson</strong><br>Nebraska Sen. Ben Nelson is another heartland Democrat who tends to be in line with McCain on a number of issues, particularly climate change. But they don't see eye to eye on ethanol subsidies, which McCain famously told Iowa voters he would cut. Taking a job in a McCain administration would give Nebraska's Republican governor the chance to appoint a GOP replacement, which could factor into Nelson's decision making, particularly if losing his seat would deny Senate Democrats the 60-vote supermajority needed to truly command the Senate.</p> <p><strong>Mark Sanford</strong><br>South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford (R) wins praise from some who note he shares McCain's views on farm subsidies, but others say South Carolina is too far from the nation's corn fields.</p> <p><strong>Terry Everett</strong><br>Alabama Rep. Terry Everett (R) is from the South, not the Plains states or the West, but \"he knows ag backwards and forwards\" because of his long tenure on the House Agriculture Committee, said Myron Ebell, director of energy and global warming policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute.</p> <p><strong>Edward T. Schafer</strong><br>\"Why not keep the current guy [Schafer] in place?\" suggested Maisano of Bracewell &amp; Giuliani. \"He just came into the job a year or two ago.\" Well, the current agriculture secretary's chances of holding onto his job might be harmed by those E. coli outbreaks.</p> <h2>Secretary of the Interior</h2> <p>The nation's landlord, the Interior Department manages 500 million acres of land and the oil-rich Outer Continental Shelf, overseeing not just oil supplies but coal, natural gas, wind, solar, and geothermal too. The department also administers much of the West's water supply, national parks, relations with the nation's tribes, and protection of endangered species. Traditionally headed by a well-known Westerner, Interior has endured embarrassments in recent years, including meddling by a high-ranking deputy on endangered-species protections that allegedly could have affected her family farm, and drunken sexcapades by Minerals Management Service employees hobnobbing with industry representatives.</p> <p><strong>Dirk Kempthorne</strong><br>There's been some speculation that McCain might just keep current Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne in place. \"That would not be smart in light of the departmental scandals,\" said Pitney at Claremont McKenna College. Environmentalists agree, saying he has protected fewer endangered species than James Watt, is a strong backer of oil-shale leasing in the Rockies, and supported polluting industries as Idaho governor. They say he has done little to clean up agency shenanigans.</p> <p>Nonsense, says Maisano of Bracewell &amp; Giuliani. \"Kempthorne doesn't have an ounce of any responsibility for those scandals; in fact he's been part of the team breaking them up.\" Maisano and others say Kempthorne knows D.C. and the West well (as a former Idaho governor and U.S. senator). Kempthorne has come up to speed on the controversial issues facing Interior, including offshore oil drilling, the proposed listing of the polar bear as endangered, wind power leases, and coal mining permits. He is also as passionate about national parks as McCain. In fact, says Maisano, \"I would think Kempthorne might be more comfortable with the McCain camp than the Bush camp.\"</p> <p><strong>Jon Huntsman, Jr.</strong><br>Utah's Jon Huntsman, Jr. (R), another Western governor who is the son of a chemical magnate, would be more palatable to some. He has been more moderate than expected, and wants Utah to reduce fuel and energy consumption. He is also concerned about nuclear waste being stored in his state, which might raise red flags for McCain.</p> <p><strong>Barbara Cubin</strong><br>Right-wingers say it is vital for McCain to remember that to win and keep Republican support in the West, he needs to select a rural, lands-rights supporter \"who knows something about the history of federal lands and what the problems really are,\" said Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute. \"Someone from the intermountain West like Gale Norton, but who is not an urbanite like her.\" Rep. Barbara Cubin (R-Wyo.), a pro-mining, rural Republican who is pushing a bill that would require new refineries to be permitted within 90 days, would be ideal for them.</p> <p><strong>Wayne Allard</strong><br>Colorado's Wayne Allard (R), a veterinarian by trade who is retiring from the Senate, also would fit the bill for lands-rights GOP'ers.</p> <p><strong>Wayne Gilchrist</strong><br>Surprisingly, environmentalists and industry reps alike mention Maryland Rep. Wayne Gilchrist, a nine-term congressman who this year was defeated for reelection in the GOP primary by a right-wing conservative. Gilchrist is a senior member of the House Natural Resources Committee, and he worked for the Forest Service in Idaho for a brief period. But Ebell says it would be ridiculous to have an East Coaster running Interior, no matter how liked he may be inside the Beltway for protecting Chesapeake Bay. The real deal-killer could be his endorsement of Obama, though.</p> <h2>Bonus Position: Energy/Climate Czar (or Czarina)</h2> <p>The 2008 oil spike proved how politically potent energy issues can be. A President McCain might seek to demonstrate a firm hand by appointing a top White House official to coordinate administration policy on energy, with climate change also tacked onto his or her portfolio.</p> <p><strong>James Woolsey</strong><br>Jim Woolsey, the former CIA director turned climate-change and renewable-energy wonk, was hired by McCain during the primary season as a senior adviser on these issues. Some say he's the leading candidate for an energy czar job because he knows global politics so well and is a formidable advocate for domestic energy production as a security policy, not to mention for electric cars. Woolsey has already served under four U.S. presidents in a variety of roles. It would be interesting for the one-time head of the nation's secretive spy agency to sit down with world ministers to hammer out climate-change policy. \"I'm sure he can disarm them,\" quipped one Republican strategist. </p> <p><strong>Sarah Palin</strong><br>Sarah Palin, who has already said she'd like to handle the energy portfolio as vice president, might pull rank and keep the energy czar job for herself. Somebody needs to pick up where Dick Cheney left off, property-rights advocates and climate-change skeptics say. Environmentalists say not a chance. Palin has sued the federal government to stop listing of polar bears as an endangered species and pushed for more oil and gas drilling, among other moves. \"I think Sarah Palin would be great,\" said Ebell of CEI.</p> <p><strong><br>Arnold Schwarzenegger</strong><br>California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) is termed out as California governor in 2010, can't be president because he wasn't born in the United States, and is looking for greener pastures. He's got megawatt star power and hands-on experience crafting an ambitious climate plan.</p> <p>\"I can't think of a better energy czar than Arnold Schwarzenegger,\" said DiPeso of Republicans for Environmental Protection. He said that while the \"Governator\" could run for the Senate, \"I don't think he'd be interested. He's the sort of guy who likes to be in charge. \u2026 The best job for the Terminator is to hold a high-level executive position. He's demonstrated an interest in the issue, and he's got the policy right. There wouldn't be any on-the-job training there. He's done the bipartisan cracking of heads and gotten people together.\"</p> <p>Of course, AB 32 -- the California climate law -- has yet to be fully implemented, and Schwarzenegger's popularity has sunk amid the state's fiscal woes. Still, California and its toothsome governor could both be winners no matter who becomes president. Both McCain and Obama have said that unlike Bush, they would order a waiver granted to enable California to proceed with plans to regulate greenhouse gases from automobiles.</p> <p>Curiously, Schwarzenegger hasn't visibly campaigned much for his good friend John McCain (though he's scheduled to hit the trail in Ohio this week on the GOP ticket's behalf). There's talk in Sacramento that the reason is that he'd love to be energy czar for someone else: Barack Obama. With his spouse's Kennedy clan connections (cue the Maria Shriver endorsement footage), he might be ready to pack his bags.</p> <p>Schwarzenegger spokesperson Julie Soderlund laughed off all the talk, saying, \"The Governor is 100 percent focused on California and meeting the challenges the state is facing right now. So at this point the governor is not looking beyond the immediate needs of the state.\" She said he had done half a dozen in-state appearances for McCain, and would stump for him in Ohio on Halloween. Also, his air board's plan for cutting greenhouse gases would give free permits to polluters, which McCain favors, rather than the 100 percent auction that Obama supports. Some environmentalists say while Schwarzenegger has taken bold action at times, he has also vetoed or stalled on key protections, mollifying large utilities and the heavily polluting shipping industry, for instance. Trick or treat, anyone?</p>",
  "<p>\"With Maradona on board, Argentina's national football squad is like the Beatles,\" footballer turned businessman Guillermo Tofoni said last week. Tofoni's company WorldEleven markets Argentina's international friendlies and his comment about the famous Liverpool band was said in the context of how much Maradona's presence brings in terms of publicity when he travels with the squad.</p> <p>Today, the question on many an Argentine mind is whether the Beatles analogy reflects the rationale behind long-serving Argentine FA president Julio Grondona's shocking decision to appoint Diego Maradona manager of Argentina.</p> <p>\"Let's not jump the gun,\" Maradona told Radio Mitre a few hours ago. \"We've had a first meeting and Grondona's proposal really seduces me.&#xa0;But we still need to talk some more.\"&#xa0;But the headlines around the world have already been written,&#xa0;the news has broken and we have a story.</p> <p>Maradona has made no secret of his desire to remain linked with the national strip, and since Alfio Basile quit the job a fortnight ago there has been much speculation about who would replace him.&#xa0;In spite of Maradona's impressive and forceful campaign, conducted mostly through the media, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/oct/17/argentina-worldcup2010qualifiers\" title=\"\">the people's choice seemed to be Carlos Bianchi</a>. Yet Bianchi's long-standing personality clash with Grondona seems to have been unsurmountable.&#xa0;By contrast, Carlos Bilardo, the manager who led Argentina to two World Cup finals in 1986 and 1990 - with spectacularly good results in the former and one of the ugliest football displays in the country's history in the latter - appears to have been able to overcome his long-standing personal feud with Grondona.&#xa0;In the proposed management scheme, Bilardo would be a crucial part of the committee that Maradona would front.</p> <p>\"It's a birthday gift I don't wish to unwrap until Thursday,\" Maradona says. He turns 48 on October 30 and the appointment is expected to be formally announced tomorrow. \"We're journalists, we don't ask questions,\" one hack told me off the record before going on to explain how the committee is expected to look: Maradona at the helm (\"I am the one who will chose the team\") with Bilardo in a semi-director of football capacity.&#xa0;Pedro Troglio, currently managing at club level in Paraguayand an ex-team-mate of Maradona's, would also be involved,&#xa0;as would Jose Luis Brown and 'El Negro' Enrique, both players from the 1986 World Cup-winning squad.&#xa0;Fernando Signorini, who worked for many years with Cesar Menotti and has been close to Maradona throughout his career, could take up a role as a fitness coach.</p> <p>One of the most popular chants for Argentina fans is: \"We will once again be the champions, just like in 86.\" Could this be the way forward?&#xa0;A handful of players, the same manager, and Maradona in charge? The reaction of the Argentine press has been one of incredulity.&#xa0; \"Bianchi would have been a more serious appointment,\" one vox-popped fan said. Journalists echoed the sentiment. \"It's not so much weird as absurd and shameful,\"&#xa0;one told me. \"My theory is that Grondona actually doesn't want Argentina to win the World Cup,\" another said.</p> <p>Most negative statements were uttered in the traditional off-the-record premise, while the media analysed where they stood in terms of towing editorial lines.&#xa0;But Daniel Arcucci, of <em>La Nacion,</em> was happy to be quoted: \"The risk is the destruction of the myth - how will someone so close to being a deity handle such an earthly task?\"</p> <p>The negative reaction mostly stems from Maradona's turbulent off-the-pitch track record.&#xa0;Notoriously unreliable, lacking in discipline, and with an innate contempt for established rules and corporate status quo, will he be able to impose order and focus among the players who could form one of the best squads in the world?</p> <p>I suspect he could.&#xa0;To footballers more than anyone else, Maradona is inspiring.&#xa0;His respect for the game and the craft of playing is contagious, and among the current squad there are players such as Juan Rom\u00e1n Riquelme and Carlos Tevez who have been close to him professionally.&#xa0;The younger superstars - Lionel Messi and Sergio Ag\u00fcero, soon to father Maradona's first grandchild - will be in awe of him and hungry to learn.</p> <p>Let us not forget that Maradona's impact on those near him is immense.&#xa0;When he turned up to play in a charity match organised by Robbie Williams, Marcel Desailly was reported to have sat down and whispered: \"If Diego says something to me, I'll wet myself.\" Alastair Campbell wrote an epic feature about their encounter in which he - Campbell - came across as humbled.&#xa0;Commanding the respect of the players is not going to be the problem.</p> <p>\"He is going through his best moment of the last decade, without a doubt,\" Arcucci continued. \"Healthwise but also in terms of stability. Of course, with him, you never know how long it will last.\" Juan Pablo Mendes, from <em>Ole</em> sports daily, shared a meal with Maradona and several other journalists in Bolivia earlier this year following a match in support of President Evo Morales.&#xa0;\"He was mentally and physically better than he has ever been,\" Mendes told me. \"The question is whether he will be able to sustain the pressures of a job like this one.\"</p> <p>During this summer's Olympics, Maradona had a presence among the squad,&#xa0;invited in by manager Sergio Batista, another 1986 team-mate and old friend.&#xa0;In this informal way, by just being around and chatting and encouraging the players, it seems Maradona transmitted positives to the squad.&#xa0;But his formal track record as manager - short stints at Mandiyu de Corrientes and Racing de Avellaneda; about a dozen matches with each club and a total of three wins - leaves a lot to be desired.</p> <p>Is a great player necessarily a great manager? Is the art of football management, to quote a friend from these pages, more alchemy than pure chemistry?&#xa0;Maradona could be the greatest alchemist of them all:&#xa0;why not believe in magic?</p> <p>The reality has potentially terrifying consequences because until Grondona makes a statement of intent we are left wondering what the motivations behind this appointment are.&#xa0;If it is the idea that global marketing and scattering breadcrumbs for the seagull world press is good business, then football may suffer. As Diego Latorre, a forgotten hero who now pundits, put it to Tofoni when the Beatles analogy was uttered: \"The problem with marketing is that it's got to stop when the match starts.\" Until the whistle blows for kick-off, everything else will be conjecture.</p>",
  "<p>Doctor Who's Tardis has landed in the Yorkshire Dales, in the form of an old field-barn which slides open to reveal a 21st-century \"holiday pod\".</p> <p>Crouched on a hillside above the hamlet of Appletreewick, the hidden conversion of Beck barn, renamed Tommy's Laithe, may help rescue hundreds of similar buildings \u2014 among the most iconic in Britain's northern landscape.</p> <p>Architects at Feilden Clegg Bradley Studios have transformed the late-19th century barn which from the outside still looks as old and agricultural as its many, similar neighbours. </p> <p>But scramble over a series of damp tussocks and peer through the hayloft window, and a world of carbon neutral wood panelling and waste-composting lavatories lies neatly \u2014 and completely \u2014 hidden in the 18th century byre.</p> <p>\"Yes, it is like Dr Who,\" says architect Matt Somerville, opening the barn door into a lofty living space filled with sunlight. \"This could be the answer for hundreds of disused barns in the Yorkshire Dales national park. That's why we're experimenting with this one to find out.\"</p> <p>The work was suggested by the Creative Re-use Studio of FCB, a partnership whose wider work includes the Cold War Museum at RAF Cosford, Nicosia's new art gallery and the high density Accordia housing estate in Cambridge which won the Stirling prize for architecture two weeks ago. Tommy's Laithe is on a much smaller scale, but it has major implications for a famous and distinctive British rural landscape.</p> <p>The lower slopes of the Dales \u2014 Wharfedale, Wensleydale and Swaledale in particular \u2014 are teaming with small fields divided by drystone walls and each with a barn like Tommy's. But these barns, once a key feature of Britain's smallholding agricultural system, are falling into disuse.</p> <p>\"They're the legacy of a smallholding system, when 18th and 19th century farming families could subsist on units as small as one field and barn, plus summer pastures high on the open moors,\" says Somerville, who says there are 4,500 of them in the Dales national park. Eighty of them are on the Bolton Abbey estate where Tommy's Laithe is situated. </p> <p>Last year, the park authority carried out a survey which found that 40% of the barns were in poor or bad condition. At the same time, draconian planning restrictions make it almost impossible for conventional conversions to get permission.<br> Tommy's Laithe, which is named after a shepherd who once kept his sheep at the barn, is a grade II listed building. FCB architects were able to stay within planning restrictions by building a freestanding wooden structure inside the barn which does not touch the walls, like a second skin.</p> <p>\"The principle is that it can be removed as quickly as we are installing it, without leaving a trace of its presence on the barn,\" says Somerville. </p> <p>The so-called field-barn pod will be tested at Tommy's Laithe over the next year, once builders move out at the end of this month.</p> <p>Somerville starts a tour in the cosy bedroom of the hidden house, wood-panelled and insulated with Herdwick sheep wool. Built with \u00a315,000 from the Yorkshire Dales Millennium Trust and grants from the Bolton Abbey estate and others, the pod stands completely free of the barn walls, like a second skin. </p> <p>The pod has room for a shower plus a kitchen in a foldaway cupboard. The lavatory composts and services come in from a mobile trailer outside.</p> <p>\"On preliminary surveys, we noticed how many barns had a farm trailer or something similar parked by them,\" said Somerville. \"The power trailer, which has a small boiler for the water, solar panels and other green equipment, looks like that. It feeds everything into the pod via a sort of umbilical cord.\"</p> <p>The unique barn \u2014 unique now, but a possible template for its empty counterparts \u2014 will be run for the course of an experiment as a holiday rental for two. Final permission for occupation is still needed from the national park, but staff there are keen to test if a market exists for such innovative versions of the traditional holiday cottage.</p> <p>\"It will be warm and comfortable,\" says Somerville, as wind whistles through the muck-hole where manure from cattle was spaded out to fertilise the surrounding field for the following spring. One of the first tasks for FCB, and the team from specialist builders' Linfords, was to dig out two feet of cattle and sheep muck dating back 150 years. </p> <p>Holidaymakers at Tommy's Laithe will be able to sit in bed with the double doors open, on warm summer evenings, and look out into the 60% of the barn which is not used by the pod. Part of the deal with the Bolton Abbey estate is that the old walls and stone roof will be repaired, and woodworm expelled from the gently crumbling timbers which once divided the cow-stalls.</p> <p>\"But we don't yet know how the visitor market would behave,\" says Somerville. \"Would they be unhappy that they can't drive up here, and have to walk the last quarter of a mile? Would they want more facilities? Would there be enough of them anyway? The only way to find out is to get a fieldbarn pod into action, and so that's what we've done.\"</p>",

At the end of the day it doesn't matter how many comfy sofas and coffee shops they put in their store, they still can't gain the atmosphere of a local bookseller, someone who knows what their selling and, above all, whom they're selling it to! Radish does this, and more, because as well as books the shop also carries a massive selection of Fair Trade products. Their sense of community is not confined to the immediate vicinity but expanded to a global awareness.<br><strong>Stuart Hudson</strong></p> <p>Radish is a great little Fair Trade bookshop that also sells jewellery, clothing and odd knickknacks. Their collections of fiction and non-fiction are very well chosen, and the helpful staff can usually find something inspiring on their shelves when I've run out of ideas! They support local musicians by including them in their range of CDs and also stock hand-selected art print. This isn't the place I go to find books I want, it's the place I visit to find books I'd never thought of, or sometimes just for a chat and a browse.<br><strong>Matt Baxter</strong></p> <p>A refreshing change from bland old Borders and Waterstone's. The proprietor, Beth, has created a warm atmosphere, her commitment to Fair Trade is genuine, and her support for local music is widely respected. Radish fits well into Chapel Allerton. The area often attracts unfair criticism in the press, but in reality has a buzzing community scene and Radish actively encourages its customers to get involved. It's this community spirit I really admire. Radish is more than just a damn fine bookshop, It's a genuine part of its community. Its one of the nicest corner of Leeds I've come across, and the people out there need to know!<br><strong>Scott Thurlbeck</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.paper-treasures.co.uk/\">Paper Treasures, Whitley Bay</a><br>152 Park View, Whitley Bay, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, NE26 3QW<br>0191 252 3474</h2> <p>I would like to nominate Paper Treasures as an outstanding small bookshop, which in a very short time has become an important fixture in Whitley Bay.

The turnover of shops on the high street is worryingly high, but this bookshop survives - it's just what the town needs.<br><strong>Pat Oddy</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.bookcase.co.uk/\">The Book Case, Hebden Bridge</a><br>Market Street, Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, HX7 6EU<br>01422 845353</h2> <p>Right in the middle of town with an expensively attractive window display to lure you in. It has every book I want, and even when it hasn't, the staff (all mad, thank goodness) always seem to know about it and usually get it in for me before I've had time to go home and come back again. Felicity knows everything and deserves a medal. They all deserve a steep pay rise. And they have fantastic cards to go with emergency birthday purchases.<br><strong>Kerry</strong></p> <p>The Book Case is splendid and I don't know what we would do without it. We live in France and, even with Amazon, there are often questions and glitches that mean we don't get the books we want when we want them. The Bookcase, on the other hand, does everything possible to help us, advise us, and supply us. On long rainy mornings it's a solace to ring up and have a gossip about books with Felicity, one of - if not THE - best read people in the British Isles. My favourite example of Bookcase behaviour: once we wanted a book that was out of print. They searched the second-hand bookshop across the road, got the book and sent it to us. I ask you, who could ask for more?<br><strong>Betsey Parker</strong></p> <h2>Rievaulx Books, Helmsley<br>18 High Street, Helmsley, North Yorkshire, YO62 5AG<br>01439 770912</h2> <p>A compact shop nestling just off the village square in this marvellous corner of the North York Moors national park. It stocks a good range of secondhand material, mainly biographical and historical, and boasts an excellent topographical section that has a bias towards Yorkshire. Recently it has added to its remainder section but in this respect it is trumped by the Bargain Bookshop that sits just 30m up the road. Best use of an hour? Select a volume and walk two minutes to the Feathers Inn. You can sit and read with a pint of Timothy Taylor's.<br><strong>Darren Holmes</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.coversavebooks.co.uk/\">Coversave Books, Knaresborough</a><br>1 Kirkgate, Knaresborough, North Yorkshire, HG5 0BQ<br>0870 745 2969</h2> <p>This bookshop is 275 miles from my home - but it is the best place to obtain out-of-print titles. I have tried other book-finders but never met with such speedy, friendly and customer-conscious prices and service. My son and family live in Knaresborough, so we have visited the Coversave shop. It is certainly small, and shelf space is tight, but there is something for everyone. If any title cannot be seen and is not in stock on-site, rest assured Coversave will do their utmost to oblige.<br><strong>Peter M Howard</strong></p> <p>On a visit to Yorkshire last October, I entered the tiny and quaint CoverSave Books in historic Knaresborough. What a gem, obviously loved by the owners, who eagerly assist customers in any way they can. After purchasing a few items for our grandchildren, I mentioned that I had been looking for a certain book from my own childhood for over 40 years. I gave them details and within a month the book arrived at my Canadian address -I was absolutely thrilled. Elisa Stevens and her parents have come to feel like friends, through their e-mails and diligent research.<br><strong>Marina Midgley</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.citikey.com/business/10053910/\">Little Apple Bookshop, York</a><br>13 High Petergate, York, YO1 7EN<br>01904 676103</h2> <p>Nestling in the shadows of York Minster, the Little Apple Bookshop is a delight to all book lovers. Whether you are after the latest paperback, a signed biography or a quirky gift for any member of the family, the staff will happily serve you and make you feel very welcome. The book ordering service is excellent - usually next day - and puts the major retailers to shame.<br><strong>Sarah Jackson</strong></p>",
  "<h2>Abacus books, Altrincham<br>24 Regent Rd, Altrincham, Cheshire, WA14 1RP<br>0161 928 5108</h2> <p>A wonderful shop for the browsing bibliophile, crammed from floor to ceiling with all sorts of secondhand and new books, from the eclectic to the classic. Their sister shop, Jardine's, on King Street in Knutsford, has an equally varied and fascinating selection of new titles, and they're always ready to order in books or advise you. These are great family-run shops, with a lovely friendly atmosphere.<br><strong>Felicity James</strong></p> <h2>Bramhall Village Bookshop, Bramhall<br>44-46 Bramhall Lane, Bramhall, Cheshire, SK7 1AH<br>0161 440 7889</h2> <p>The Bramhall Village bookshop, right in the centre of Bramhall Village, is the best bookshop for miles, and has been for over 35 years. Its long-serving, friendly and knowledgeable staff make it a pleasure to visit, before you even begin to look at the expanse of books. I've been known to search for a book without knowing the author or title and, by briefly describing the plot, the staff have found it and given an educated opinion of it. They hold author signings, kids' holiday reading sessions and my everlasting memory will be the big party - fancy dress competitions, wizards on hand, cheerleaders etc - to celebrate the last Harry Potter. The range of stock, overall shop atmosphere, buying judgment, customer service and new initiatives are all outstanding.

I have used it since its inception, usually receiving ordered volumes within 48 hours. Its staff are energetic and delightful; I regard them all as good friends. They provide an atmosphere of courtesy, kindness and admirable generosity: one staff member has lent me several of her own books, which I might well have bought without her offer. Booklovers are encouraged to visit the shop simply to see what's new. Honesty compels me to admit that after our children left home, my wife has tended to chide me for filling our house with books. But most readers of this will forgive me.<br><strong>Dr Philip Markman</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://simplybooks.tbpcontrol.co.uk/tbp.direct/customeraccesscontrol/home.aspx?d=simplybooks&amp;s=C&amp;r=10000115&amp;ui=0&amp;bc=0\">Simply Books, Bramhall</a><br>228 Moss Lane, Bramhall, Cheshire, SK7 1BD<br>0161 439 1436</h2> <p>A brilliant bookshop. The owners Andrew and Sue are a delightful couple, always ready to help, advise or recommend a book. The shop is so well-stocked with lovely books that when I plan to buy one I often come out with three or more! With their background in education and contacts with local schools, children are well catered for: their events for children are always fantastic and over-subscribed. They also organise literary lunches, book signings and launches with well-known authors - always very exciting and well-attended. There is also a regular book club enjoyed by all members. I highly recommend a visit to Simply Books very soon and after browsing, try their coffee shop: in my opinion, it serves the best coffee in Bramhall.<br><strong>Gerald Anderson</strong></p> <p>Another very small bookshop. It opened about two years ago and Andrew Cant and Sue Steele had pictures up in the cafe (it has a tiny cafe, which is lovely!) of what the space looked like before they converted it into the delightful place it is now. I first visited it in connection with a visit to Bramhall High School, but Andrew and Sue are very supportive of local writers and I've been back there to do an event on more than one occasion. It's a really friendly shop where the booksellers know the stock and their customers, and are very kind to both.<br><strong>Ad\u00e8le Geras</strong></p> <p>As an author, in the past four years I've visited hundreds of bookshops. My favourite one has to be Simply Books. Sue and Andrew invited me for three days, took me out to dinner, put me up at their own place and organised a literary lunch at a nearby Italian restaurant. Brilliant!<br><strong>Caroline Lawrence</strong></p> <p>A very welcoming shop, with books to suit all tastes and an excellent children's section. The shop is not large but you can browse for as long as you like and never feel uncomfortable. Owners Sue and Andrew have even found room for two or three tables where you can enjoy a latte or a cappuccino, and they're planning to expand upstairs to provide more space forchildren's events. They will order anything, often having it ready to collect the following day. They really know their books, are well-informed about all the latest releases, and organise author events and activities and readings for children, both in the shop and elsewhere; they helped me bring two leading authors to an arts festival in a small Cheshire town. They do so much more than just sell books.<br><strong>Pauline Ward</strong></p> <h2>Sam Read, Ambleside<br>Broadgate House, Broadgate, Grasmere, Ambleside, Cumbria, LA22 9TA<br>015394 35374</h2> <p>Sam Read's is brilliant. It's not just that it's in Grasmere (though that helps: there's something fun about choosing a book - or, more usually, several - in hiking boots). It's that its two small rooms are crammed with classic and contemporary literature, history, biography, poetry and even philosophy. Everything seems to have been judiciously selected by someone with eclectic but impeccable taste. The trick is simply see what they have. Every time you'll come out with something you've been meaning to read for ages, seen reviewed but forgotten about, or never heard of but that looks fascinating.<br><strong>Chris Peers</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.bookscumbria.com/shop/about.htm\">Bookcase, Carlisle</a><br>56 Castle Street, Carlisle, Cumbria, CA3 8JA<br>01228 544560</h2> <p>A secondhand bookshop, spaced over three very grand and labyrinthine floors, with every conceivable subject covered in a well-ordered fashion. There is also a music department offering classical and jazz CDs and LPs. They also have a gallery of art works and a local reading group, and they promote art, music and book events. All this with a friendly service.Give it a visit!<br><strong>Ian Brough</strong></p> <h2>The Bluebell Bookshop, Penrith<br>8 Angel Lane, Penrith, Cumbria, CA11 7BP<br>01768 866660</h2> <p>This bookshop has been here for about 25 years and is independently run on an ethical/fair trade basis. Whenever you go in, there is something interesting happening - an exhibition (which might be anything from a local sculptor or Nepalese photographs). Recently there was an exhibition of wool insulation in the very large window space. I often wonder how/if Derek, the owner, actually makes a profit! It appears muddled and messy but Derek and the staff know where everything is and can get anything really quickly. Upstairs there is coffee, tea and Derek's raspberry scones and chocolate muffins. If he has time there is bread and cheese for lunch, to which you can help yourself. I haven't mentioned the books/CD's/maps - sections are labeled using handmade paper and there is a really good selection - from just published books to classics and specialist literature. Local authors and Cumbria also feature - but not too much! Oh and I nearly forgot to mention the brilliant childrens' section.<br><strong>Liz Hind</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.ulverstonbookshops.co.uk/\">The Bookshop at The Tinners Rabbit, Ulverston</a><br>48 Market St, Ulverston, Cumbria, LA12 7LS<br>01229 588858</h2> <p>This is not just a bookshop - it is a meeting place, an events centre, a friendly haven in a small bustling market town. Liz Drew has, since 1999, made this the centre of cultural life here, assisted by her knowledgeable and helpful staff, Belynda and Melanie. Just around the corner is Liz's satellite bookshop dedicated to health, the environment and spirituality. Here one can relax with a coffee on the comfortable sofa while at the Tinners Rabbit there is an open fire, an armchair and beanbags for the children. As well as helping you to find just the book you want, Liz arranges free talks on matters of health and spirituality, runs a thriving and lively reading group and somehow finds time to organise an annual Readers' Day as part of a local arts festival.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.qype.co.uk/place/135966-Michael-Moons-Bookshop-Whitehaven\">Michael Moon's Antiquarian Bookshop, Whitehaven</a><br>19 Lowther Street, Whitehaven, Cumbria, CA28 7AL<br>01946 599010</h2> <p>Don't be deceived by the small frontage, it stretches a long way back. Michael sits at a very cluttered desk and seems to be on the telephone a lot, but this is all to the good as no-one spoils your fun. There are thousands of books to be perused: no leather sofas, no coffee, just books. The a smell of old perishing leather and mouldy pages is, to a lover of books, better than anything produced by a perfumier.<br><strong>Pamela Clatworthy</strong></p> <h2>Bestsellers Bookshop, Buxton<br>3 Bridge Street, Buxton, Derbyshire, SK17 6BS<br>01298 79521</h2> <p>Owned and.run by Lyndsey, the most helpful of bibliophiles. She and her minions maintain an excellent stock and are able to find the most obscure books in a twinkling of an eye. As a school librarian I want books yesterday, especially when requested by eager teenagers, or enthusiastic colleagues in the English department determined to encourage the love of their subject.

Over 3.5m titles are available from the website, and the shop also organises the Peak Festival - an autumn event, which attracts popular writers and over 5,000 people.<br><strong>Mike Hennessy</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.ckbroadhurst.co.uk/\">Broadhursts, Southport</a><br>5-7 Market Street, Southport, Lancashire, PR8 1HD<br>01704 532064</h2> <p>It's a joy to buy from a bookshop where the staff have a good literary knowledge, and you can explore as many nooks and crannies as you like, finding thousands of books. And to have them wrapped in brown paper is a lovely old-world touch.<br><strong>Simon Howard</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.newsfromnowhere.org.uk/\">News From Nowhere, Liverpool</a><br>96 Bold Street, L1 4HY<br>0151 708 7270</h2> <p>I fell in love with this bookstore as soon as I came across it on a stroll up Bold Street. A not for profit, workers co-operative that has a commitment for social change, it appeared to offer a host of magazines, postcards, music and of course books, that would not be readily available in a mainstream establishment. Walk into the store and find a book on Zapatista stories, or something for the discerning vegan, feminist, eco-activist, or concerned individual. Take plenty of time with you, as this place is captivating.<br><strong>Kevin Watkinson</strong></p> <p>The centre of my world is News From Nowhere, an independent, not-for-profit radical and community bookshop. It is run by a small collective of women workers.<br><strong>Ambreena Manji</strong></p> <p>This bookshop catches your eye even on the rather kooky end of Bold Street. It describes itself as a 'radical bookshop' which makes its seem loveable and not in the least bit threatening, an enterprise that gives new meaning to the phrase 'armchair anarchist'. A mosaic-like sign welcomes you. Walk in and the first thing that catches your eye is the blazing red of communist and socialist magazines. News From Nowhere wears its political colours in one shade only, but there is more to see. This is the centre of independent magazines in Liverpool, where 'zines such as Everything You Hate, on the Liverpool rock scene, nestle comfortably next to The Ecologist and The Idler. The staff are interested in your choices, but only if you want them to be, and this bookshop has radical literature of all kinds. It also has the largest collection of anti-George Bush books I've ever seen. News From Nowhere is interesting, provocative and gives the underground a step up.<br><strong>Jenny O'Mahony</strong></p> <h2><br><a href=\"http://www.abebooks.com/home/255555/\">EJ Morten Booksellers, Manchester</a><br>6 Warburton Street, Didsbury, Manchester, M20 6WA<br>0161 445 7629</h2> <p>Situated in the oldest street in Didsbury in a building built in 1823, Eric Morten established his own bookshop in the front room of number four in 1958. Within two years he had moved into number six, and within a short time he had the whole row of small shops, from two to 10, which he now owns. This became a mecca for booklovers, not only in Manchester but throughout the world. The children's section is vast, there are educational books in abundance, and the latest titles are always in stock. Eric has been in the trade for over 65 years. Any taxi driver will tell you how to get there.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.magmabooks.com/\">MAGMA, Manchester</a><br>22 Oldham Street, Manchester, M1 1JN<br>0161 236 8777</h2> <p>Manchester isn't renowned for its quality independent bookshops - largely because Waterstone's monopolises the market, with two stores within as many yards of each other. However, MAGMA, positioned in the bustling Northern Quarter, stocks an unparalleled selection of photographic, fashion, arts and graphic design books for the professional, student or merely curious. Additionally, a wall of British, American and European magazines offers up virtually every cultural title available. The surprisingly unpretentious staff offer help and advice on all titles.<br><strong>Jon Lawrence</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.rhyme-reason.co.uk/index.jsp\">Rhyme &amp; Reason, Sheffield</a><br>681 Ecclesall Road, Hunters' Bar, S11 8TG<br>0114 266 1950</h2> <p>This place is a treasure chest and a source of inspiration. Many times I sought advice as to how to encourage my young boys to read at a time where they were totally anti- reading. Thanks to the fantastic staff, my children have now become avid readers and I have found expert service that is rare indeed. A real gem.<br><strong>Martin Lewis</strong></p>",
  "<h2>G David, Cambridge<br>16, St Edward's Passage, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, CB2 3PJ<br>01223 354 619</h2> <p>Just a stone's throw from King's College but hidden away in a narrow backstreet behind a picturesquely overgrown graveyard, G David is everything a university town bookshop ought to be. The shelves are well-stocked with academic texts at extremely reasonable prices for the students, and antiquarian books at rather higher prices for the dons, but there's plenty to interest the browser, too - the fine binding sets, in particular. Poetry lovers are particularly well-served with an extensive section that covers hard-to-find small press editions as well as the usual sets of complete works and anthologies. No matter when you visit, you're guaranteed to emerge clutching a bargain.<br><strong>Sarah Crown</strong></p> <p>I don't often allow myself to go there anymore because I always find something I \"have to have\". I have bought, among others, a first edition of Dylan Thomas's second book of poetry, two first edition CS Lewis's and two books from the library of Richard Burton, bound in green suede (given to him as a birthday present by Elizabeth Taylor!) It's simply a treasure - always something interesting from 99p paper backs to \u00a3100 rare first editions. I would be heart-broken if it ever closed.<br><strong>Helen Stear</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.libra-aries-books.co.uk/\">Libra Aires Books, Cambridge</a><br>9 The Broadway, Mill Road, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, CB1 3AH<br>01223 412 411</h2> <p>Recently opened on cosmopolitan Mill Road is Libra Aires 'Alternative' Bookshop, offering a weird and wonderful collection of books, magazines and pamphlets on everything from earth mysteries, folklore and paganism to green politics and vegetarian cookery. Kids' books, handmade notebooks and cards and even dowsing rods are available, as is an impressive selection of second-hand and remaindered titles. Community events are publicised. The friendly staff are happy to chat, to search for customer requests and offer a mail order service. Occasional book signing events have been held. This funky bookshop is fun and has something for everyone.<br><strong>Scott Hilliard</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.toppingbooks.co.uk/\">Toppings, Ely</a><br>Toppings, 9 High Street, Ely, Cambridgeshire, CB7 4NB<br>01353 645005</h2> <p>A lovely place, particularly on a Sunday, to stop and browse. Having recently extended the shop, stock - including children's and young adults' literature - is excellent. Staff are knowledgeable, helpful and friendly. Evening events are arranged with authors and signed copies are available.<br><strong>Mary Bannister</strong></p> <p>Wonderful selection - a real bookshop with knowledgeable staff. We go every time we are within reach. The stock is superb, idiosyncratic, lots of really interesting older books, not just current mainstream. Beautifully presented, etc etc ...<br><strong>Derek Janes</strong></p> <p>I stopped off in Ely to look at the wonderful cathedral and happened upon Toppings. I was offered tea and cake before I had even started looking. The request for a fairly obscure book was satisfied immediately from a bottom shelf of their packed and well-designed bookshop. I ended up spending over \u00a3100 in the most thoughtfully-stocked bookshop I have seen for many a year. It seemed designed with me in mind which must be the ultimate if rather solipsistic compliment!<br><strong>Mike McGrath</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.peakirkbooks.com/\">Peakirk Books</a><br>15 St Pegas Road, Peakirk, Peterbrorough, Cambridgeshire, PE6 7NF<br>01733 253182</h2> <p>If you love old children's books this is the place for you. A friendly welcome and books stacked floor to ceiling in a special room upstairs - you'll find old friends, rekindle old memories and spend many a happy hour wallowing in nostalgia. What could be better? A real tonic. There is also a large stock of general books - you're bound to come out with something special. Heather and Jeff are always generous with their knowledge and time.<br><strong>Annette York</strong></p> <h2>Hannay, Braintree<br>118 High Street, Braintree, Essex, CM7 1LA<br>01376 322647</h2> <p>This bookshop has served the area very well for 50 years, and is still owned by the same family. The staff believe that the needs of the customer are paramount, and nothing is too much trouble them. Some have worked there for years and years, and know just which firm to deal with to fulfill special orders. Good manners, courtesy and know-how are a good combination, and it's these qualities that make Hannay more unique with each passing year.

The helpful staff can order what you want through their speedy computer often for the next day. Bev Tankard, the owner, and her enthusiastic team have a great community spirit and links with local schools, inspiring young readers with their save-and-buy book club. There is a loyalty card scheme that keeps customers returning, an email alert service for regular customers, and late open evenings for special occasions.

Steps down from the busy street lead to a discrete basement entrance and a world of books, the walls lined with an endlessly fascinating collection from all fields. The travel writing and local history collections are excellent, or you can pick up a 50-year-old gardening book for under \u00a310 that holds more useful information than a series of Groundforce. Though it has just a few rooms, it nonetheless has a labyrinthine and mysterious feel, extending further into another basement room, with fiction of all sorts and an extensive biography section, then upstairs into rooms of philosophy, entertainment, art and photography, and more. The staff kindly offer help finding books in any subject. Its one of my favorite bookshops.<br><strong>Jeff Geiger</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.redlionbooks.co.uk/\">Red Lion Books, Colchester</a><br>125 High St, Colchester, Essex, CO1 1SZ<br>01206 578584</h2> <p>A bookshop in the centre of Colchester. There are two Waterstone's and numerous other competitors, yet they have carved out a niche and filled it with a loyal and knowledgeable customer base. One of the best things is that while specialisation is obviously a protection from the chains it often leads to a retreat from the main stream: not so in this case. The shop is family owned and run by a disparate staff, all united (naturally) by a love of books. Both of the owners are heavily involved in the book trade (Peter is on the National Booksellers Committee). Their position is buoyed by a close relationship with authors, both local and national. Terry Pratchett is the most high profile guest; Red Lion Books was the only independent bookshop on his last tour. Shops like these are as much a labour of love as they are a business and should be celebrated.<br><strong>Robin Donaldson</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.biblio.com/bookstores/lgb.html\">Leigh Gallery Books, Leigh-on-Sea</a><br>135-137 Leigh Road, Leigh-On-Sea, Essex, SS9 1JQ<br>01702 715 477</h2> <p>Secondhand bookshops are the opposite of the usual shops - you don't go there looking for something; you go for something to find you. The unique Gallery bookstore is metonymy incarnate, because like most bookstores of its ilk, you wade through stacks of paperbacks and yellows before you come across something amazing. The staff are decent - it's family-run, I think, and they remember you. Still, after many years between visits, they tell me about their new acquisitions in my area of interest. Best of all, in summer, they have a little table outside, under a small canopy in case of rain, on which they stack the least expensive books. That little table is out all night long, with a tin in which one is asked to place a pound. When it gets light, there are slightly fewer books and slightly more pound coins. There's not much to recommend this little seaside town - a few ok pubs and the driven estuary. And this hidden treasure, this topographical baroquism.

How does it survive?<br>1. Stock enormously varied.<br>2. Titles not in stock ordered from a wholesalers who usually deliver within 48 hours, often the next day.<br>3. Staff are enthusiastic and knowledgeable readers.<br>4. Local writers are promoted with launch parties and signing sessions.<br>5.

Fall into a conversation with the owner and what began as a 30-minute exploration of the Hanratty case becomes a funny and enthralling two-hour discussion on anything you like. You can also sit undisturbed for hours, leafing through the books you want, and leave with them all for under a tenner. It's a gem.<br><strong>Andrew Peeld</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.aldeburghbookshop.co.uk/\">The Aldeburgh Bookshop, Aldeburgh</a><br>42 High Street, Aldeburgh, Suffolk, IP15 5AB<br>01728 452389</h2> <p>There's been a bookshop on this site for many years, but the current proprietors, Johnny and Mary James, are exceptionally well-informed and well-read and will order anything they haven't got in stock. Local authors and interests, including the year-round musical activities at Snape Maltings up the road, are well represented, and there's a good children's section with room to sit cross-legged and browse. The Jameses have launched an annual Literary Weekend, now in its fourth year and extremely popular. Their own idiosyncratic tastes led them, for example, to be well in the vanguard of Alexander McCall Smith appreciation - he had the whole of Suffolk eating from the palm of his hand when he gave a talk at the Literary Weekend in 2003 - and Aldeburgh sales of his No 1 Ladies Detective Agency books must contribute substantially to his royalties.<br><strong>Henrietta Bredin</strong></p> <p>When I go in there thinking there are no more books I want to read, I always find one that I do. Furthermore, it's usually on the table by the door. When I am looking for a particular book, they always seem to have it in stock - it's almost as if they run the shop just for me. The shop itself is reasonably big and quite airy and has a lovely children's section. It has all of the traditional qualities of independent bookshops without rubbing them in; the whole thing is done with a light touch. This, I think, is because it is run by a couple who know their stuff and understand the needs of their customers - or of this one at least. Finally, their literary festival is stellar this year, featuring Clive Anderson, Sally Beauman, Beryl Bainbridge, Tony Benn, Lady Antonia Fraser, Harold Pinter and Anthony Sampson, among others.<br><strong>Nick Lerner</strong></p> <p>A wonderful discovery - not only many books that I want to buy, but also a marvellous atmosphere of people interested in reading. If you linger in one of the inviting armchairs, you can find yourself contributing ideas to satisfy the blossoming literary interests of a 10-year-old - but you also have the opportunity to browse unhindered, unless you ask a question when the staff are both helpful and knowledgeable. The bookshop is also fantastic as a remote user: books are ordered and dispatched with efficiency; no textbook too obscure.<br><strong>Anthea Palmer</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.bardsleysbooks.com/\">Bardsley's Books, Bungay</a><br>22, Upper Olland Street, Bungay, Suffolk, NR35 1BH<br>01986 892077</h2> <p>I stumbled across this fabulous mess of a bookstore while working for a publishing company, going there to sell books and ending up buying instead. Something of an archetypal second-hand bookshop, around 90% of the floor space is taken up with waist-high piles of books, creating an almost labyrinthine atmosphere as you search and shovel your way to undreamed of treasures and jump with joy as you realise that you have finally completed your Martin Amis collection for the astonishing price of \u00a313.50. I have only ever been to Bardsley's once, but it will probably be the reason that I will holiday in Suffolk rather than the US this year - although I will still be taking the statutory empty suitcase.<br><strong>Ian Shine</strong></p> <h2>Chapel Books (aka Bob's Bookshop), Saxmundham<br>The Street, Westleton, Saxmundham, Suffolk, IP17 3AA<br>01728 648616</h2> <p>Apart from the wide-ranging and eclectic selection of books, both modern and antiquarian, any bookshop where you summon the proprietor by banging a tin can with the stick provided is alright with me. Several battered sofas are supplied for reading on, and Bob often comes out to ask whether any browsers would like a tea or coffee. The shop even sells vinyl records (of varying quality). Potential thieves should take note of the sign warning that if you steal a book, when you leave the shop an alarm will go off in your head.<br><strong>Jonathan Paige </strong></p>",
  "<p>Nor for the first time, I find myself wishing I could see all the angles. Maybe I've just watched Miller's Crossing and the Maltese Falcon too may times. Much as I may sit here with a cold flannel folded across my forehead, I damned if I can see the angle. Stanford's angle.</p> <p>I can certainly see him and his name. Everywhere I look. But what I can't see is his motivation. What makes a man, an American who can't stand Test cricket, spend hundreds of millions of dollars on a game of Twenty20?</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/mar/02/cricket.news\" title=\"\">When I spoke to him, or rather, listened to him talk at me</a>, earlier this year he had an answer that came neatly packaged in three parts: for fun, for money, for the sake of the West Indies.</p> <p>The first of those is true enough: Stanford is hosting a hell of a beano. He's acquired a late-in-life taste for cricket much as another man might a motorcycle. He keeps the company of some of the world's finest players, and hosts a party for 8,000 or so people each night which he watches, just like Jay Gatsby, from his balcony.</p> <p>But a man doesn't make himself a billionaire through squandering his savings on shindigs. Since joining up with the England Cricket Board, Stanford has committed himself to a minimum of $100m in prize-money for these matches alone over the next five years. On top of that are the considerable sums spent on wages for the Legends, coaches and staff, the ground itself, the regional Stanford 20/20 tournament, the project to professionalise the island teams, the subsidising of the West Indies Cricket Board and the exploration of America as a viable market for cricket.</p> <p>It all amounts to far more than a man of Stanford's ilk would spend on something that was all pleasure and no business. Financially, Stanford claims that the chief corollary benefit is in raising awareness of his brand, Stanford Financial. And yet, how many cricket fans are going to be potential clients of a top-end wealth management firm?</p> <p>Stanford Financial have a track record of sponsoring events which have appeal to a clear demographic of potential clients: a polo tournament, a sailing regatta, golf and tennis competitions. All of which bring him a far greater return in new customers for far less money than cricket has yet or ever will. Cricket has, at least, given him a massive profile boost in the City of London, turning him, in the words of one journalist out here, into the world's most famous 239th richest man in America. The common theory is that this is his chief motivation. Certainly he has earned himself far more than $20m worth of publicity.</p> <p>Stanford Financial managed to avoid the sub-prime mortgage fiasco that rocked so many of their competitors. Sir Allen himself told Forbes magazine that in five years he sees his firm competing with companies the size of UBS and Wachovia. As layoffs have mounted across the wealth management sector, Stanford Financial are on a recruitment drive. \"There are a lot of deals to be made in financial services,\" he told Forbes, \"banks, brokerages and trusts.\"</p> <p>Certainly the 20/20 for 20 has put him in a much better position to grow his business in the City. As for the money to be made directly from the match itself, the ceiling of the potential profits sits far lower than his expenditure on it all. As long as he is in partnership with the ECB rather than the BCCI, then it is going to stay that way. The huge money in cricket comes with a presence in India, not England.</p> <p>As long as the project to convert Americans to cricket remains a pipedream and Stanford is in cahoots with the English, the tournament is never going to make the kinds of blockbuster sums associated with the future of Twenty20. He invited India, remember, to play this challenge match after they won the World Twenty20, but they turned him down.</p> <p>The wildly optimistic top-estimate for the global TV audience for Saturday's match is 700 million. Even that figure would return him only $10m in broadcasting rights: not even close to covering his costs.</p> <p>If the match was on terrestrial TV in the UK he would be closer to achieving the kind of mainstream breakthrough that he craves, drawing a primetime audience of people who don't necessarily love cricket, but would be happy to watch Freddy and KP play for $20m. On Sky though, the game is in a ghetto, and a large part of the constituency aren't even interested. The ground itself is so small that gate receipts will be negligible. It is tough to see where the money will come from.</p> <p>Which leaves the philanthropy. At first Stanford insisted that he intended to professionalise all the regional Caribbean teams playing in the 20/20. It was one of the most exciting aspects of the whole endeavour, and would have done much to improve the standard of cricket in the West Indies. However the four teams he paid to go full time - St Kitts, Nevis, Antigua and Barbuda, and Anguilla, have now been dissolved and the project shelved.</p> <p>All of which means that those three reasons he gave are rather less clear-cut than they appeared. The motivation behind the Stanford shebang isn't apparent. Sir Sir Allen Stanford's game clearly isn't cricket, not as we know it, so just what is it?</p>",
  "<p>Personally, I think a BBC suit should be taken out and horse-whipped, live on the News at Six, every time the suit collective over-reacts when a light dusting of snow falls on the Television Centre. </p> <p>This usually happens at a time when highland Britain is engulfed in a blizzard. There was a hint of it on air this morning and it only serves to remind licence payers not lucky enough to live in the London W12 postcode \u2013 almost certainly a majority \u2013 that some people don't get out much. </p> <p>Gosh, a horse-whipping! That sounds like an over-reaction, Mike. Of course it's an over-reaction. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/oct/29/russell-brand-jonathan-ross-bbc\">The whole Jonathan Ross-Russell Brand affair</a> has been an over-reaction, except at the BBC itself, where the problem has been one of impressive under-reaction. Dammit, on Sunday morning the BBC press office was saying it had \"no knowledge of any complaints\" from listeners. They were still saying it at 6pm.</p> <p>So for a \"scandal\" of such alleged magnitude, it's been a slow burn. The Radio 2 broadcast in which Brand and Wossy insulted that popular old trouper, Andrew Sachs \u2013 since playing Manuel in Fawlty Towers the 78-year-old actor has basked in beatified status \u2013 went out on October 18. </p> <p>It took a week to go viral, a Jurassic unit of time by modern media standards - when any mega-scandal less dramatic than murdering a baby on Blue Peter (\"here's one I chopped up earlier\") has usually come and gone in 48 hours.</p> <p>Yet here it is, on all our front pages today. Even Piers Morgan, a journalist synonymous with moronic behaviour for many of us, has joined the pompous chorus of outrage in the Daily Mail, widely echoed elsewhere. </p> <p>\"Brand is just a self-obsessed ex-junkie, a pre-Raphaelite version of Bernard Manning who will literally say anything to make a cheap tabloid headline\" (etc, etc), writes Moron. </p> <p>That fits with my third-hand impression of the boy, though one should always understand that there is a market for oafish teenage narcissism: readers, listeners, viewers who are themselves oafish, teenage narcissists of all ages deserve their share of programmes and role models to emulate. Some even pay their licence fee, I expect, and cannot be expected to be out on the street abusing pensioners all day.</p> <p>On closer reading it turns out that Morgan's real grouse is with Wossy, a talented but shameless hypocrite, he suggests. Piers and Jonathan were once good mates who employed each other in mutually beneficial ways. </p> <p>Alas, Ross ended up calling Morgan \"a fat waste of space\" so Morgan called him \"a washed up old has-been\". Is this hissy fit because I am getting a rival interview show on ITV, Piers asks himself, in a rare moment of introspection. SO IT'S ALL ABOUT PIERS MORGAN AFTER ALL.</p> <p>I digress here to underline the point that undisciplined, media self-absorption is a growing problem of our time and an aspect of the Ross-Brand affair, as it is of the snow-on-TV-Centre problem. Compare what happens now with this:</p> <p>When Louis Heren, a famous correspondent of the Times (he left school at 12 and ended up deputy editor), trekked across the Himalayas to find the team that had just conquered Everest in 1953 he offered the paper a piece about how he managed to obtain his scoop. The foreign desk loftily cabled back: \"Readers of the Times are not interested in the adventures of its correspondents.\"</p> <p>But that was stiff-upper-lip then. Now we are all guilty of trembling jawed egotism now. Some good stuff is generated that way, but the style requires editors and managers who know where to draw a line. Sometimes they succeed, sometimes they make a bad call. </p> <p>The important thing is to admit mistakes quickly and put your hands up. This is where the BBC got it wrong, often does. In doing so it plays into the hands of the Mail, the Murdoch empire and other enemies of the Beeb, a great national institution, against which they are either jealous, spiteful or simply commercially-motivated (a bit of all three).</p> <p>Yet again this morning there was no senior executive, no director-general, Mark Thompson, no member of the BBC Trust, on Radio 4's Today programme. Humpo had to settle for ex-BBC grandee, Sir John Tusa, who told the suits to \"get a grip\" \u2013 offset by a creative called Stuart Murphy who argued that talented mavericks are popular and we all had to put it in context.</p> <p>Imagine what Humpo, Paxo, Oxo and the rest would do to a government, or even to the kind of hedge fund manager who has just blown your pension short-selling Volkswagen shares, if they failed to show up for a beating! </p> <p>Yet it happens all the time. In 2003 it was then-DG Greg Dyke's failure - for three whole weeks - even to listen to the fateful Andrew Gilligan-Humphrys broadcast on what Alastair Campbell allegedly \"sexed up\" over Iraq (knowing it to be untrue, Gilligan claimed) which did the damage during subsequent inquiries. </p> <p>The BBC board (now trust) didn't even challenge what they were told about Gilligan's source, Dr David Kelly, whom the Beeb, incidentally, dropped in it; fatally so, as it turned out, though they were not to know.</p> <p>Does it still happen? Of course it does. The last time I caught Radio 4's Feedback programme, the admirable spot where listeners can fight back (fears that it was being nobbled have faded, yes?) there had been lots of complaints about Robert Peston's hyper-active coverage of the global financial crisis. Quite legitimate too, says me. </p> <p>But BBC News wasn't putting up a spokesman to justify him or itself \u2013 for the second week running!! What does that tell us? That they don't think there's a problem here, actual or potential. Since when RP's profile has risen and all sorts of people are on his case, keen to do him harm.</p> <p>It may be that the 500,000 worldwide hits that the Peston blog is currently getting - a day \u2013 is the BBC's justification. That's even more hits a day than Wossy gets pounds a month. Actually no, it's \u00a3500,000 a month we're paying him. But brace yourself for the train crash which may be round the corner, probably on the blog.</p> <p>What does Wossy have in common with Peston? They're both energetic maverick talents (Gilligan was the same), whom the suits find hard to manage, so they concentrate on managing simpler things and lesser talents: it's easier.</p> <p>Myself, I'd sack Brand, who is a serious, expendable prat, and fine Wossy for breach of contract (what are lawyers for, but to find one?). </p> <p>That and generally read the Riot Act about effing-and-blinding-creep which even I notice across BBC products. It's not the Guardian, chaps! It's funded by the licence payers and you have obligations to them all.</p> <p>There again, what do I know? This morning I said over the breakfast table \"it says here in the Mail that Andrew Sachs' granddaughter admits she did have an affair with that Russell Brand, just like he said on air.\" Mrs White looked up from the Guardian and replied: \"I'm not surprised, he's gorgeous, isn't he? He can leave messages on our answerphone any time he likes.\"</p> <p>There are times when that woman disappoints me.</p> <p><strong>Late flash:</strong> The peerless pair have just been suspended. If everyone at BBC HQ at TV Centre/Broadcasting House had been quicker on the ball and grovelled sooner this week's newspaper humbug-fest could have been avoided. Don't seem to have learned much from the Gilligan affair then?</p>",

But tucked away opposite the mainline railway station is one of London's best second-hand shops, called My Back Pages for the delight of Dylan fans. Inside, there's a small selection of new books, mostly cheap classics, and a huge selection of second-hand. History, classics, politics and psychology are all well covered, and fiction takes up a room to itself.<br><strong>Sean Clarke</strong></p> <p>With Streatham and Balham served only by a couple of blighted Smiths and a few charity shops, Back Pages is great. Unusually, the shop presents new and used books next to each other on the shelves, meaning you can stay in there, absorbed, for hours. I nipped in on the way to the Bedford once and was 45 minutes late to meet my friend. Whoops. But I had bought a map of Czechoslovakia. Yup, Czechoslovakia. Love that shop.<br><strong>Jonathan Vincent</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.bookmarks.uk.com/cgi/store/bookmark.cgi\">Bookmarks, Bloomsbury</a><br>1 Bloomsbury Street, WC1B 3QE<br>020 7637 1848</h2> <p>Although it is a shopfront for the Socialist Workers Party, it stocks a wide range of books, both new and secondhand, that you are hard pressed to find anywhere else. The secondhand section is absolutely superb for picking up hard to find journals, publications and pamphlets of the Left, both in Britain and overseas. When I came to the UK to research the British left, Bookmarks was as a valuable source as any library.<br><strong>Evan Smith</strong></p> <p>Bookmarks is now the only bookshop in central London that specialises in socialist material, and is one of the main outlets for literature published by trade unions and the labour movement in general. It is, in fact, more than a bookshop, as it provides bookstalls for trade union and labour movement conferences and major meetings, and is always to be seen operating from under gazebos at major demonstrations. It also provides facilities for writers to present their books, either at the shop itself or, for larger occasions, at the nearby church in Shaftesbury Avenue. In this sense, it is a rare gem, not only for London but the UK as a whole.<br><strong>Alan Gibson</strong></p> <p>Bookmarks has a great range of books that you don't see in mainstream bookstores - lots of material on trade union issues, women's rights, the fight against racism, gay liberation, the history of class struggle etc ... plus some sound books for kids. You can get everything in one place, and actually flick through the books you're interested in. They also do a mail order service if you're not living in the capital.<br><strong>Peta Bulmar</strong></p> <p>I want to nominate Bookmarks. I love the fact that it makes no pretence to be neutral. It's on the side of all those fighting for a better world - books are weapons! At the same time it's completely non-sectarian and represents all aspects of socialist and dissident thought.<br><strong>Iain Ferguson</strong></p> <p>Bright and cheerful, conveniently located near the British Museum, Bookmarks stocks a vast range of socialist and radical books. Where else could you get good advice on the latest books written on the environment, anti-globalisation, antiwar movements, and the history of the labour movement? These days books can always be bought from Amazon etc, but good advice on what is worth reading is hard to get. Bookmarks gets my vote.<br><strong>Kambiz Boomla</strong></p> <p>More than just a bookshop - a way of thinking and acting about the world. They appear not only in their central London shop but at union conferences, demos and political rallies. A resource to be visited over and over. They produce a quarterly Review of Books with an exciting line up of book launches and speakers. My only regret is that I don't get over often enough.<br><strong>Willy Cumming</strong></p> <p>In a sea of identikit commercial multiples it is difficult enough to come across independent bookshops - but to find one with such a distinct sense of purpose as Bookmarks is seriously good news. This bookshop is not shy about its politics; it proudly identifies itself with the trade union movement and the thinking Left. An antidote to the spin culture of New Labour, you might say. What a breath of fresh air! We need more of these kinds of bookshops - everywhere.<br><strong>Tugrul Kaban</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://trustedplaces.com/review/uk/london/shop/1f9327l/gosh-comics\">Gosh!, Bloomsbury</a><br>39 Great Russell Street, WC1B 3PH<br>020 7636 1011</h2> <p>Quite simply the best comics shop imaginable, and that's mainly due to their commitment to graphic novels, independent mini comics and manga. It's impossible to leave empty handed with the stunning range that is packed into the two floors here. For those seeking an education in all that comics can offer, there is no finer destination.<br><strong>Alex Ingram</strong></p> <h2>Judd Street Books, Bloomsbury<br>82 Marchmont Street, WC1N 1AG<br>020 7387 5333</h2> <p>It's a wonderful jumble of remainders and new books at cheap prices, with an emphasis on Literature and the Arts. There's a large range of 'Bloomsbury' or Bloomsbury-inspired books, due to its position, plus a loads of criticism, and it's always really high quality stuff. I used to live above it, and it was responsible for a large proportion of my student debt (despite the student discounts!).<br><strong>Clare Crawford</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.londonreviewbookshop.co.uk/\">London Review Bookshop, Bloomsbury</a><br>14 Bury Place, WC1A 2JL<br>020 7269 9030</h2> <p>Why?<br>1. The stock - superbly well-selected, and in superb condition.<br>2. The staff - highly knowledgeable, very helpful, and actually care about both their stock and their customers.<br>3. The ambience - this is a bookshop you actually want to spend a long time browsing in.<br>4. The events - no John Grisham signings, but real discussions and readings that always engage with interested readers.<br>I always leave having bought more than I intended, and I always find books I didn't even know I wanted, but then again, isn't that the point of a good bookshop? Long may they continue ...<br><strong>Robert Kingsbury-Barker</strong></p> <p>The LRB bookshop stocks the widest imaginable range of books (general interest and scholarly) within a space that is easy to navigate. The staff know what they are selling and are able to guide their customers. This bookshop functions also as a forum for literary presentations and intellectual exchanges through a series of readings and lectures. It offersan electronic newsletter of events and new books arranged by theme. Occasional wine/nibbles evenings are combined with 10% discounts on purchases.<br><strong>I Sinanoglou</strong></p> <p>In order of remembrance: No tinned music. Elegant shelves and tables. Intellectually inspiring books on display. No blockbusters on display, or on the shelves. Breadth of selection. Comfortable chair, usually empty. Intelligent-looking staff who smile indulgently if boyfriend pretends to be crazy in attempt to embarrass me out of the shop, all the books I needed for my masters in literature, nice mugs. Not too cold or too hot. Interesting literary soirees. Great associations (with literary mag). Survived the filming of the mangled interpretation of McEwan's 'Enduring Love'. Didn't give job of manager to former Tesco employee. A metropolitan beacon.<br><strong>Sarah Jenkins</strong></p> <h2>Books for Amnesty International, Camden<br>241 Eversholt Street, NW1 1BE<br>020 7388 0070</h2> <p>A great secondhand shop with a huge fiction selection in the basement, plus a very good stock of travel titles, art books, childrens' books, etc. I always end up leaving with a bag full of books, the prices are so convenient and things are easy to find. Staff are friendly, too. This shop used to be in Camden HighStreet but a while ago moved to new premises behind Mornington Crescent tube station. A must for all booklovers! And of course it's all for a good cause.<br><strong>Angela Groot</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.citikey.com/business/10151823/\">Black Gull Books, Camden</a><br>70-71 Camden Lock Place, Camden Lock Market, NW1 8AF<br>020 7267 5005</h2> <p>It's what a great bookshop is meant to be - untidy, adorable, musty, with academic, befuddling assistants, I'm unable not to buy something whenever I'm in there. The area is of course a key attraction: Camden Lock Market, next door to renowned jeweller Roger Stone and world famous games and puzzles specialist Village Games. They have (mainly) almost mint condition books at a fraction of the retail price, and a witty (and gorgeous) sales assistant to inform you on what you're buying.

But under the eccentric rule of Christina Foyle, Foyles was ramshackle and consumer-unfriendly. \"Foyled again?\" mocked a sign in the window of a nearby competitor. No longer. These days people browse for hours in Foyles for pleasure, and not because they can't find what they're looking for among the 1.4m books on its five floors of shelves. It even has its own website. Foyles has also provided a home to treasured independent retailers made homeless by soaring rents, Ray's Jazz Shop and Silver Moon women's bookshop.<br><strong>Jon Dennis</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.johnsandoe.com/\">John Sandoe Books, Chelsea</a><br>10 Blacklands Terrace, SW3 2SR<br>020 7589 9473</h2> <p>This is my favourite bookshop in London, and it's independent credentials burn all the brighter for being right next door to the bland corporatism that is today's King's Road. It has a secondhand bookshop feel, without the funny smell, and the staff are supremely helpful and seemingly always better read than you. There's a good selection of imported US books (including Dave Eggers' McSweeney's journal) and a selection from most genres/subjects which, given the shop's size, is something of a miracle. Clambering up the little spiral staircase reveals another aladdin's cave upstairs, with a sort of concertina shelving system, so that they can shoehorn in a few more books. T'riffic.<br><strong>Daniel Carey</strong></p> <p>A prince among booksellers. The stock is intelligently and seductively presented, service is prompt and courteous, the staff erudite yet free of Mitfordesque snobberies. A invaluable resource for the professional writer, a treasure trove for the present-seeker, a paradise for the browser. And the bags are classy, too.<br><strong>James Owen</strong></p> <p>I went there for the first time in the same week as the shop was profiled in the Guardian's G2 piece. I've been trying to track down novels by David Storey (vastly under-rated) and they had four in stock. I only managed to find one of these myself as they were stored in different places, but the chap in the shop had no hesitation in taking me straight to the others. The shop is cramped but the selection of titles is excellent.<br><strong>Robert Hollier</strong></p> <p>Is there any competition? Forget the beautiful location, and the beauty of the shop itself - it is truly a wondrous thing to spend time with only the best of books in print. No wading through piles of what is fashionable or sold by the yard here. The texts are impeccable selected and the staff deftly steer you to what you need. I cannot number all the new works and ideas I've been introduced to in those narrow walls. As a poorly read undergraduate I used to be dazzled by this generosity; I now owe much of my career and many friendships to it.<br><strong>Navraj Singh Ghaleigh</strong></p> <h2>World's End bookshop, Chelsea<br>357 King's Road, SW3 5ES<br>020 7352 9376</h2> <p>I thoroughly recommend the World's End Bookshop to all readers - particularly those searching for second-hand contemporary and classic novels. It is a great place to browse, with a really diverse selection of books, many of them review copies which have not even been opened. The atmosphere is very relaxed and the sales staff knowledgeable. Visit on a Sunday or Monday when there are big discounts.<br><strong>M Woolf</strong></p> <h2>Financial World Bookshop, City of London<br>90 Bishopsgate, EC2N 4DQ<br>020 7444 7118</h2> <p>I would like to nominate this great shop in the City of London (near Liverpool St station). It may not be of interest to the general bookworm who know their Auster from their elbow, but for those of us who need to keep up with new ideas and writing on finance, this place is a godsend. A most friendly atmosphere (probably something to do with the nice staff) and a really varied array of books on all the main subjects as well as good general finance reads.<br><strong>Laurie Donaldson</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.bertramrota.co.uk/\">Bertram Rota, Covent Garden</a><br>31 Long Acre, WC2E 9LT<br>020 7836 0723</h2> <p>Most people walking down Long Acre don't look up at the elegant facades above the chain store windows. They should - through an anonymous door and up a dark stairwell at Number 31 waits the bibliophile's mecca. I come here to escape crowds and consumerism, browsing first editions by favourites like Nabokov or Robert Lowell. The shelves display a wonderful assortment of literature, private press and illustrated books, far too much to see in a single visit.<br><strong>Mark Walton</strong></p> <h2>Offstage and Treadwell's, Covent Garden<br>34 Tavistock Street, Covent Garden, WC2E 7PB<br>020 7240 3883</h2> <p>These two bookshops-in-one are a great find in the heart of Covent Garden. Upstairs, Treadwells is full of mysterious books about magic, myth and belief amid incense and even magic wands! There's also a lovely sofa to relax on while you read and think. Downstairs is Offstage Bookshop (which recently moved from premises on Chalk Farm Road): a mecca for actors and drama students. Offstage stocks film and play scripts and every time I've been there I've never failed to find a gem of a title. It's the most original and friendly bookshop in London!<br><strong>Polly Barker</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.booksellercrow.com/\">The Bookseller, Crystal Palace</a><br>50 Westow Street, Crow on the Hill, SE19 3AF<br>020 8771 8831</h2> <p>An absolute jewel of an independent that satisfies the most catholic and adventurous tastes, crammed to the rafters with poetry, classics, screenplays, art, black interest, essays, travel, some hippy stuff, a fantastic children's section that caters for those cutting first teeth right through to those cutting apron strings, loads of biographies of people that aren't cricketers (although they have those too), and an amazing range of old and new fiction (the shop has the particular and rare distinction of stocking some stunningly good US-only titles, which are stealth bombed in at regular intervals). The Bookseller Crow is the fast-beating cultural heart of Crystal Palace, and Jon Main, Justine Crow and Joy Haney are the knowledgeable and accommodating trio that stoke its ventricles with such unflagging zeal. And Jon once went to a party with Raymond Carver. Say no more.<br><strong>Paul Morley</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.renaissance-books-uk.co.uk/\">Renaissance Books, Crystal Palace</a><br>28-30 Church Rd, SE19 2ET<br>020 8653 1884</h2> <p>I can't recommend Renaissance Books enough as a friendly place to browse for hours, turning up unexpected delights ranging from the psychology of drugs to obscure musical tomes. Their philosophy section is huge and carefully chosen and they can turn up almost anything for you if you ask. They have some charmingly quirky areas of expertise - fairy tales and textiles spring to mind - and their poetry and fiction sections are equally impressive. A small but perfectly formed bookworm's refuge.<br><strong>Alice Ross</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://dulwichbookshop.tbpcontrol.co.uk/tbp.web/customeraccesscontrol/home.aspx?d=dulwichbookshop&amp;s=C&amp;r=10000132&amp;ui=0&amp;bc=0\">Dulwich Books, Dulwich</a><br>6 Croxted Road, SE21 8SW<br>020 8670 1920</h2> <p>For a small community to be served by one bookshop is great, to have two is unbelievable. But Dulwich is so blessed, and for me Dulwich Books on Croxted Road is the place to go. A good selection of books, great staff and a first class order service means that you don't need to go anywhere else for all your book needs. Plus they often have fantastic art on the walls.<br><strong>Peter Harrison</strong></p> <h2>The Bookshop, Dulwich Village<br>1d Calton Avenue, SE21 7DE<br>020 8693 2808</h2> <p>I am a local resident and longstanding customer of Hazel Broadfoot's and Julian Toland's superb bookshop in the heart of Dulwich Village. The standard of shopfitting, the range of stock relative to the size of the shop, the helpfulness and knowledge of the staff, overall shop atmosphere, buying judgment, customer service and new initiatives are all outstanding in this marvellous enterprise. I find it much better to use than one of the chain bookstores in the centre of London. It is rare for me not to be able to obtain exactly what I want straight away or very soon afterwards. The staff are unfailingly kind and well-informed. Their advice is always relevant and lucidly expressed. The Bookshop is open seven days a week and is always full of potential customers and school children. It has become a centre of cultural excellence in my part of south London; I find myself drawn to it magnetically every weekend.<br><strong>Anthony Lester</strong></p> <p>Well-informed and efficient service by people who read books and are in touch with the publishing world and local authors, and who like to run their own little bit of the book world. Why shouldn't they be able to indulge in their interest and benefit their customers?<br><strong>Ian Mitchell</strong></p> <p>To live near any bookshop is a pleasure. To be a close neighbour of The Bookshop is a privilege. Julian and Hazel seem to read nearly everything. They give us capsule reviews at the desk, and time permitting, will willingly go into more detail. They will not only get most orders in within two days, they have got to know our individual tastes. So when I asked Hazel for something \"a bit dark and unpleasant, but not TOO horrible,\" for myself, she was able tocomply (Janet Evanovich in this case). Large chains can offer lower prices; they can't get to know you like a friend.<br><strong>Stephanie Calman</strong></p> <p>My local bookshop is as important as my local pub, and when I moved a mile and a half up the road from East Dulwich to Dulwich I comforted myself with the fact that my old local bookshop would still be within walking distance. Then I discovered The Bookshop, which was like upgrading pubs from one with great beer and great food to one with great beer, great food and an inglenook with a roaring fire. Don't be put off by its diminutive size - it's like a TARDIS, and there's a far greater choice of books on display than the laws of physics should really allow. If it's not on the shelf, all the staff seem to be trained in the art of finding exactly what you want on the computer and then having it there the next day. And if by some chance it's not quite what you wanted, you don't have to have it. Perfect. Improvements? Well, they could start serving beer as well as books...<br><strong>Ian Harrison</strong></p> <p>1. The staff are always friendly and helpful.<br>2. Excellent service - I order a book one day and it is available the next.<br>3. They are always able to give helpful suggestions whether it is a book for Granny, teenager or middle-aged academic.<br>4. Displays are up-to-date. The bookshop partakes in community activities including literary events.<br>5. It is small and manageable - no vast escalators - and yet has an excellent range of stock on all subjects.<br><strong>Vee Gilliard</strong></p> <p>This is the best bookshop I know. A small shop, packed with stock, it is run by helpful and knowledgeable staff, who obviously enjoy reading, and are willing and able to advise customers. Orders arrive within 24 hours. Book selection for children is particularly good. All my Christmas presents for those awkward teenage nephews and godsons were quickly solved.<br><strong>Emma Russell</strong></p> <p>This bookshop combines the intimacy of a village store with a considerable topical range (children's books, novels, history/biography, humour, art/architecture, photography). The staff are friendly and always willing to check on the availability of books that are not in stock; orders are often filled within 24 hours and customers are phoned as soon as a book arrives.<br><strong>I Sinanoglou</strong></p> <p>My favourite bookshop in the UK. All the staff have a real enthusiasm for books, are always willing to advise and help, never patronise and even welcome my dog. What more could anyone ask? On top of this they are open on Sundays which is the best day for browsing leisurely along the shelve.<br><strong>Vicky Carnegy</strong></p> <p>They know about books and can discuss them, and when you order them they arrive quicker than you can say Amazon. They don't move the sections around each month at the behest of some marketing spiv. Bestsellers are not in your face but must compete with all titles. They also encourage kids to read the stock before buying, have wine at Christmas and are family-run. The have become part of the community and that makes the actual buying of the book part of the enjoyment.<br><strong>Harvey Edgington</strong></p> <p>I have been an enthusiastic supporter for many years. Why? Because the staff members are so knowledgeable, in detail, in every area I have interests in - poetry, current novels, travel - and generally have exactly what I want in stock. If not, their ordering system brings the needed book in a couple of days or so after my enquiry, heralded by a phone call that it has arrived. A lovely place to visit, to linger in, sampling and perhaps buying anything from the latest Gruffalo story to the most recently updated Rough Guide on Corsica. In 2000 they received the Best Independent Bookseller Award, and from there have gone on from strength to strength<br><strong>David Nash</strong></p> <p>I use The Bookshop for all my requirements. They will always obtain a book very quickly, saving me the trouble of trying to locate it online. They have a wonderful children's section. Importantly for me, they never patronise me, a rare thing in some small bookshops which can intimidate with their highbrow atmosphere.<br><strong>Fay Stirling</strong></p> <p>Everyone there is enthusiastic and friendly. They really know about books, and they display them so enticingly that it is hard to walk past! They are expert at looking up obscure publications, and efficient at getting most things in the very next day. Couldn't be better.<br><strong>Margaret Hanton</strong></p> <p>The bookshop is packed with interesting books, I have rarely gone there and not found the book I wanted, and then another one that has taken my fancy. Any book can be ordered and it often appears the next day. The bookshop's great strength is the knowledge of its staff; I have gone in with a book half-remembered from a review and found the staff patient and well read as they trawl they memories to find the book. Once a month or so there is a talk held either at the bookshop or the nearby Dulwich Picture galley.<br><strong>Duncan Hibberd</strong></p> <p>A great little bookshop. The staff are excellent with a wide range knowledge. Every corner of its floors are crammed full of reading treasures. Often they order in my special requests with no trouble but great speed.<br><strong>Patrick</strong></p> <h2>Two Jays Bookshop, Edgware<br>119 High Street, HA8 7DB<br>020 8952 1349</h2> <p>Books upon books upon books. Struggle through the piles and you will be rewarded. Lots to delight, and regulars get a discount.<br><strong>David Marcus</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.newbeaconbooks.co.uk/\">New Beacon Books, Finsbury Park</a><br>76 Stroud Green Road, Finsbury Park, N4 3EN<br>020 7272 4889</h2> <p>I visit this shop once a year and it never changes. New Beacon deals with titles from the African American/Caribbean/Black British/African communities, has been there for as long as I can remember (I'm in my 40s) and still wears the same tatty appearance. Too many posters and leaflets for events long past are pinned to the notice board; books falling over each other clutter the shelves. But despite being rough around the edges, it is welcoming, cosy and unpretentious. It stocks titles you wouldn't find in WH Smiths or Ottakar's; and even if they don't have what you want, they'll go out of their way to get it for you. The assistant, Janet, knows her books, and is great at recommending new or old titles. New Beacon Books is a well-known shop: I hope it remains so.<br><strong>Maggie Whittaker</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.allinlondon.co.uk/directory/1278/3011.php\">Nomad Books, Fulham</a><br>781 Fulham Road, SW6 5HA<br>020 7736 4000</h2> <p>This is a local bookshop in the true sense. I love going in there: the welcome is always warm and a cup of coffee from the cafe is delicious. As it's not a chain, Nomad don't have huge sections of categories, but any title they don't carry can be ordered; often, I've collected books the next day. Having said that, the selection they do have more often than not hits the spot. I love it!<br><strong>Rosemary Wright</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.thepanbookshop.blogspot.com/\">The Pan Bookshop, Fulham</a><br>158 Fulham Road, SW10 9PR<br>020 7373 4997</h2> <p>It's only when I go to this beautiful little bookshop, with its crowded tables and heaving shelves, that I realise just how stilted one's choice is in that larger chain bookshops. The books are clearly lovingly - and somewhat eclectically - chosen, with the philosophy, science and cooking sections being particularly worthy of note. There is an atmosphere of care and attention for books and a relish for books for their own sake that does away with the commercial atmosphere so often found in chain and even independent bookshops, and it's this that makes the real book lovers walk away with bulging bags. The children's section is without a doubt the best in London.<br><strong>Emily Sophie</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.broadwaybookshophackney.com/\">The Broadway Bookshop, Hackney</a><br>6, Broadway Market, Hackney, E8 4QJ<br>020 7241 1626</h2> <p>Brilliant to have a local good independent bookshop in east London.<br><strong>Rachel King</strong></p> <p>What utter joy to finally have a bookshop in the area. A new venture, but friendly and offering an excellentservice on ordering books. Here's to a long and successful existence.<br><strong>Amanda Kendal</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.welbooks.co.uk/\">West End Lane Books, Hampstead</a><br>277 West End Lane, NW6 1QS<br>020 7431 7655</h2> <p>This is a long, narrow bookshop, with books on all subjects clearly displayed in beautiful, real wood cases; there's a children's section at the back. The atmosphere is both casual and professional, and the staff are always ready with information, general help, or to have a chat about a book - they are knowledgeable about their stock, interesting to talk to. They run a monthly reading group, too. All that's missing is a sofa and a cup of coffee to aid the browsing - what a pity there isn't space for that.<br><strong>Patricia Isaacs</strong></p> <p>The Camden Times put it well: \"size is not everything and, like a sonnet or a haiku, West End Lane Books offers a selective and deeply satisfying experience with what Henry James might have called 'deep breathing economy\". Doris Lessing, among others, has made appearances here, the staff are booklovers and, with their manager Graeme Estry, choose the stock to ensure a high quality selection.<br><strong>Rosie Teasdale</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.talesonmoonlane.co.uk/\">Tales On Moon Lane, Herne Hill</a><br>25 Half Moon Lane, SE24 9JW<br>020 7274 5759</h2> <p>A wonderful children's bookshop. The owner, Tamara Macfarlane, manages to create an exciting and free atmosphere for children and parents. It has a caring, enthusiastic and knowledgeable young staff and sells the best children's books, new and old. You enter a world of magic and mystery and drama where children feel free to play, hear stories and stretch their imaginations. Tales on Moon Lane is unique and a frontrunner for the best independent bookshop award without a doubt.<br><strong>Roger Smith</strong></p> <p>A place where Alice would have found her Wonderland and then chosen a book to read. Folk gather here to enjoy books whether they are three or 93. Tamara Linke, owner and former teacher, granddaughter of Christabel Burniston, President of the English Speaking Board International, continues the family tradition in oral communication. Children deserve to meet storytellers, for through stories they become treasure-seekers. Lively, twice-weekly storytelling sessions take place where everyone is welcomed and minds are opened. A recent half-term Children's Literature Festival was a great success.<br><strong>Pauline Lyons</strong></p> <p>Stocks an excellent range of children's literature, and also imaginative, reasonably priced gifts and cards. The window displays are a delight - the Narnia one was my particular favourite: to walk down Half Moon Lane in the half light of a winter's afternoon and see this display was to be transported to a world of magic. I thought any shop with a window that could do that, was worth exploring, and I was not disappointed. The staff are very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. Browsing or buying, this is a treat of a shop.<br><strong>Dawn Kozoboli</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.rippingyarns.co.uk/\">Ripping Yarns, Highgate</a><br>355 Archway Road, N6 4EJ<br>020 8341 6111</h2> <p>A second-hand bookshop largely devoted to old children's fiction: 1950s Blyton, Blue Peter annuals, 30s adventure tales. But an excellent selection of old Penguins, too, and 100-year-old editions of Sterne and the like. Scribbled-over editions of Beatrix Potter. Cloth maps of Snowdonia. Gorgeous.<br><strong>Ros Taylor</strong></p> <p>The staff are incredibly friendly and knowledgeable, and extremely efficient at getting books in if you request them. There is a solid selection of classics etc, plus plenty more eclectic items including an enchanting selection of children's books and annuals. A diamond in the rough of the Archway Road!<br><strong>Guy Abrahams</strong></p> <p>A bookshop in which you can happily spend half a day unearthing forgotten childhood favourites, reliving your misspent youth, and browsing the large stock of new and secondhand books. The staff is young, always helpful and will look out for books you dimly remember reading when your were six, but can't remember the title of (something about an elephant and a scarecrow ... ). The owner, Celia Mitchell, is as knowledgeable and enthusiastic as anyone could hope for. You're certain to leave Ripping Yarns triumphantly loaded with books you never knew you wanted.<br><strong>Cicely Herbert</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.holbornbooks.co.uk/pages/home.htm\">Holborn Books, Holborn</a><br>17 Sicilian Avenue, WC1A 2QH<br>020 7831 0022</h2> <p>They're the best supplier of computer text books and know a bit about what they are selling. Much better quality than Waterstones. They even sell SuSE Linux, my favourite system.<br><strong>Ian Bruntlett</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.persephonebooks.co.uk/\">Persephone Books Ltd</a><br>59 Lamb's Conduit Street, Holborn, WC1N 3NB<br>020 7242 9292</h2> <p>A true gem. The official shop of the independent womens' publishers, it is a joy to visit. From the bell that tinkles when you enter, to the stripped wooden floors, to the walls piled high with the beautiful dove-grey Persephone books (all with bookmarks to match the individual endpapers), and the knowledgeable and friendly staff. The atmosphere is conducive to spending the whole afternoon in there, perched on a low chair. They also sell a few non-Persephone books, alongside their own mugs,clothes, cards etc.<br><strong>Jane Mornement</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.allinlondon.co.uk/directory/1278/3138.php\">The Owl Bookshop, Kentish Town</a><br>209 Kentish Town Road, NW5 2JU<br>020 7485 7793</h2> <p>My favourite bookstore. An independent that always manages to have very good offers. The staff is knowledgeable and helpful, but not at all intrusive; if they don't have a book in stock, they can order it for you. It's a beautiful bookshop that looks exactly like bookshops looked when I was a child: old, clean, bright and covered with books in wall-to-wall dark wood shelves (leave the blond wood for All Bar One!) without the obstruction of novelty crap. The children's section is very good. They also stock a small selection of DVDs and magazines, and organise very interesting literary events from time to time.<br><strong>Consuela</strong></p> <h2>Kew Bookshop, Kew<br>1 -2 Station Approach, TW9 3QB<br>020 8940 0030</h2> <p>The best thing about Kew is the small but intellectually robust bookshop outside the Station. The selection is hot-off-the-press and sizzling with the enthusiasm of the staff. And backlist books aren't shunted off into the publishers' graveyard; if they're good reads, quirky histories, beautifully bound unusual editions, you'll find them here under the 'Staff Recommendations' section. The evening literary parties are fun; despite hosting luminaries such as Kate Adie and Robert McFarlane, they are unpretentious and provide a real chance to interrogate the author about their work. A respite from the homogenous chains.<br><strong>Sarah Jenkins</strong></p> <h2>The Kilburn Bookshop, Kilburn<br>8 Kilburn Bridge, Kilburn High Road, NW6 6HT<br>020 7328 7071</h2> <p>Situated where Kilburn starts to worry about being tidy and well-behaved enough for its smarter cousin, Maida Vale, Kilburn Bookshop is a total joy for all lovers of books and good conversation. It's small on the outside but Tardis-like on the inside: within is an impressive variety of novels, poetry, biographies, popular science, children's fiction, etc, as well as clearly identified sections of on Black, Irish and lesbian &amp; gay interest. It carries a substantial back-catalogue of fiction and the delightful staff run a very speedy book-ordering service. Staff know when to greet customers and when to keep quiet and they are a fund of sound advice, because they love books too.<br><strong>Martin Jones</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.housmans.com/\">Housmans, King's Cross</a><br>5 Caledonian Road, N1 9DX<br>020 7837 4473</h2> <p>Left wing activists can be notoriously pedantic and humourless - not to mention bearded - so one of the surprises within radical King's Cross booksellers Housmans is stumbling across the racks of gay male porn magazines at the back, next to the latest journals from Anarchism Today and Class War. This is probably (I've never asked!) a hangover from its agreeably seedy location - although the area is rapidly losing its eccentricities as the conversion of St Pancras into a Eurostar terminal approaches. Then again, it could also be a reflection of the fact that the London Lesbian and Gay Switchboard began life in the room upstairs.</p> <p>Housmans itself is an Aladdin's cave of lefty/ecological/peacenik books (it also publishes Peace News and an annual Peace Diary), with a mesmerising depth and range of titles in stock. There's also a good poetry and photography selection, and, quirkily, a fully stocked stationary counter, plus a selection of tapes and videos of performance poetry and artists. Downstairs is the similarly lefty Porcupine Books, second-hand booksellers specialising in trade union and labour history. Unlike Bookmarks in Bloomsbury, Housmans in not tied to the Socialist Worker party. Recently emerging refreshed and even mildly spruced up (although reassuringly still dusty and chaotic indoors) from the building works that have enveloped the area, even a cursory browse is absorbing enough to make you miss your train.<br><strong>Matthew Tempest</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.dauntbooks.co.uk/Daunts_marylebone.html\">Daunt Books, Marylebone</a><br>83 - 84 Marylebone High Street, W1U 4QW<br>020 7224 2295</h2> <p>If you are like me and have a passion for reading books set in the country in which you are on holiday, Daunt's is the place to visit. It is first and foremost a travel bookshop where the books are arranged by country. Under Greece for example, along with a enormous range of hotel and travel guides, you will find, maps, phrase books, travel writing, books on the flora and fauna, history, recipes and food guides as well as a tempting selection of coffee table books on interiors, and stunning photographs of the country housed in a beautiful shop flooded with natural light There is also a collection of modern fiction for holiday reading and the shop is run by the most helpful knowledgeable staff.<br><strong>Melody Green</strong></p> <p>Hushed yet friendly, and with a beautiful mezzanine level redolent of an old college library, Daunt Books is one of the lovelier things about the increasingly chi-chi and chained-up Marylebone High Street. And although it excels in travel books there are always other delights on display. It was the first place I spotted Franck Pavloff's little book 'Brown'.<br><strong>Dionne Griffith</strong></p> <p>There are so many secondhand shops I love, but there's also one new bookstore that really stands out - and I'm sure I'll be just one of many to sing its praises. Daunt Books on Marylebone High Street is the only place to make me want to read absolutely everything on its shelves. The front section is a fantastic bookshop in its own right - with an absolutely faultless selection of new fiction and non-fiction, and the most stupendous children's section - but the travel section at the back, over three whole floors, is simply breathtaking (gosh, so many superlatives; sorry - but it's all true!). I love the idea of arranging books - novels, poetry, history, biography, whatever - according to country; I love to go in and browse, indulging the fantasy that I could go wherever I want, and knowing that if I did, I would find the perfect travel companions on those shelves.</p> <p>A bookshop for travellers ... so it stocks travel guides, travel literature, novels set in the destination, historical works concerning the destination and so much more, all organized by country. Plus a great selection of classic and contemporary literature at the front of the shop. Finally it is one of the most beautiful shops in London - a bibliophile's delight.<br><strong>Abby Thomas </strong></p> <p>It is a ridiculously trendy location, but celeb-spotting is a side issue. The real reason to go down that road is Daunt. Friendly, helpful, knowledgeable staff working in a beautiful building which holds an incredible range of stuff despite its diminutive size - and it's near where I work. I'd probably go there even if it was rubbish, because I'd rather support a small business than a chain. Because the service is wonderful, though, I find it difficult to stay away.<br><strong>Chris Coates</strong></p> <p>I'm a booksniffer rather than a bookworm (old books may be easier to chew on but sniffers enjoy the smell of new books). My personal nomination is Daunt Books in Marylebone High Street: well-lit; fragrant with binding glue and printing ink; so quiet, so well-stocked and pleasingly proportioned, that one is almost embarrassed to leave without (you guessed it) buying a book.<br><strong>Sally Crawford</strong></p> <p>My favourite bookshop in London. The window display is consistently excellent, and I am tempted inside on almost a daily basis to lose myself in their elegantly arranged selection of novels, travel guides and biographies. Like many people, when holidaying I like to read a book from the country I am visiting, and only Daunt Books gave me the chance to choose from two bookcases of German classics before I embarked on a recent trip to Frankfurt. Frankly, this bookshop is zehr gut :)<br><strong>Rachel Waites</strong></p> <p>So obvious to choose, so beautiful to use.<br><strong>Michael Harding</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.heywoodhill.com/\">Heywood Hill Books, Mayfair</a><br>10 Curzon Street, W1J 5HH<br>020 7629 0647</h2> <p>I think a mention of Heywood Hill Books is in order. On my last two trips to London, it has managed to have books in stock which Waterstone's would only order - and these were books in print, not used books. The staff are also very helpful and willing to chat. In one case they were waiting for a shipment of a book but they put me onto a shop in Chelsea (Sandoes) which had it in stock.<br><strong>Jeffrey A. Manley</strong></p> <h2>Children's Bookshop, Muswell Hill<br>29 Fortis Green Road, N10 3RY<br>020 8444 5500</h2> <p>I love the Children's Bookshop as much as my children do. The range is fantastic and the staff friendly and always really helpful - equally happy to give you advice or just let you browse in peace for hours! The manager, Lesley Agnew, persuades all the very best children's authors to visit the shop for signing sessions - so far this year we've met Emma Chichester Clark, Michael Rosen and Francesca Simon, this weekend we are off to meet Mick Inkpen. She also works hard arranging author events in local schools. We never leave without a good book - and a bag full of stickers and bookmarks, too.<br><strong>Andrea Reece</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.newhambooks.co.uk/\">Newham Bookshop, Newham</a><br>747 Barking Road, Newham, E13 9ER<br>020 8552 9993</h2> <p>I treasure it because it acts as a personal shopper. I describe the person and they suggest titles they may enjoy. It is a fabulous service and have never steered me wrong, introducing me and my friends and family to absolute treasures. They are also crucial to this extremely diverse and disadvantaged community, playing a central role, in partnership with the local council to promote books and reading to large sections of the community. I am so grateful they are there.<br><strong>Lyn Brown</strong></p> <p>For 27 years Newham Bookshop, just around the corner from West Ham's Boleyn Ground, has been cherished by both the local community and readers from elsewhere, who admire and appreciate the knowledge and professionalism of its booksellers. When browsing the impressively stocked shelves you will come across pre-school tots with their parents, professors who were themselves once users of the children's section, crime aficionados seeking the latest bestseller and football fans looking for signed sporting biographies. Newham events have become legendary. Monica Ali? Mallorie Blackman? Benjamin Zephaniah? Clare Short? Take your pick. A genuine treasure.<br><strong>Gilda O'Neill</strong></p> <p>Fantastic bookshop. Viv Archer and her staff are helpful, friendly, knowledgeable. Great at recommendations, superb kids' section and a wonderful atmosphere - books piled everywhere, yet Viv can lay her hand on a title in seconds. Great local events with authors. Truly serves a diverse and vibrant community. Can't speak too highly of this shop.<br><strong>Simon Mares</strong></p> <p>The bookshop began 32 years ago as a spin-off from a community education campaigning group which diversified into a provision of support and skills development services. Over the past decade, Vivienne Archer and John Newman have developed the stock to a point where it has to be one of the main features of quality of life in this amazing, vibrant, multi-racial but unfashionable community. Such is the range of bang-up-to date stock, it's hard to come away without a bag full - the quality customised bags have themselves have become collectors items! Over recent years the shop has sponsored signings and live speaking events with a range of renowned authors. There's also a reading group that's into it's third year and still going strong. And, the final indulgence: if you can't get there during the day and live on Vivienne's route home, you can ring up with any kind of bizarre request and have it delivered the next day for no extra charge. Seriously, you couldn't have dreamt up such a wonderful resource if you'd tried.<br><strong>Kevin Mansell</strong></p> <p>I don't just go to this bookshop to buy books, I hang out there. The staff have a great knowledge of the community they serve, they have respect for their community, and they are so in touch with their community that they don't presume that English will be your first language. It is a real example of a community bookshop. The kids' section offers stories from all over the world, so it doesn't matter where you come from: you will always feel at home. One day a really smart person will write a book about this bookshop and we will all live happily ever after.<br><strong>Benjamin Zephaniah</strong></p> <h2>Portobello Books, Notting Hill<br>328 Portobello Road, W10 5RU<br>020 7964 3166</h2> <p>I love Portobello Books. There's a great range, the owner is always game for a lively conversation, and afterwards you can always grab a coffee round the corner in one of the several cafes on Golborne Road, or eat at the Moroccan Tagine.<br><strong>Yusef Noden</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.reviewbookshop.co.uk/contact.html\">Review, Peckham</a><br>131 Bellenden Road, SE15 4QY<br>020 7639 7400</h2> <p>Review has only been open a few months but is really plugging a hole in this part of south London. The owner, Ros, obviously loves books and loves to talk about them - she's just as happy to get a recommendation as make one. Although the stock on the shelves is small (but very well chosen for my money) she can order anything for you and in most cases you'll have it the next day. Getting a tiny discount from Amazon and then having to go and hunt for your parcel at the post office just doesn't compare. As well as fiction she stocks art books, photography books, cookery books, poetry, lovely cards, little gifts and she'll make you a nice cup of coffee too. Since I never want anything on those three for two tables anyway I don't see the point in going anywhere else now.<br><strong>Joanne Leonard</strong></p> <p>A bookshop that really believes in making its customers welcome. Although small, it has a fairly comprehensive range. It stocks some local authors, has very good stationery and cards, and sells organic coffee. It's not right on my doorstep, so I don't visit as often as I'd like, but when I do, it's always a pleasure.<br><strong>Dawn Kozoboli</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.primrosehillbooks.com/\">Primrose Hill Books, Primrose Hill</a><br>134 Regent's Park Road, NW1 8XL<br>020 7586 2022</h2> <p>This is my favourite bookshop in London; it's a small, friendly place with a great selection of both new and secondhand books. It is small, but brilliantly laid out with a big central table for rummaging for books you haven't heard of... yet. They are really into classics and new and undiscovered authors and have lots of information if you need it. You can pretty much ask for anything (out of print or not), and they'll either have it or attempt to get hold of it for you. They don't have any 3 for 2 offers on the latest bestsellers, but regularly have book signings and events for both local authors and anyone who they think has written a good book. They recommended such classics to me as The Life of Pi and The Number One Ladies Detective agency before anyone had ever heard of them.<br><strong>Libby Campbell</strong></p> <p>I love the shop and have been going there for 25 years - Jessica andMarek are enthusiasts, readers who recommend and love books. Theyproduce beautiful booklets at Christmas and in the summer, recommendingbooks and gifts. Each recommendation is personal, literate andthoughtful. The shop is a delight, full of interesting finds andclever predictions. It is one of the jewels in this area and we alllove it.<br><strong>Jonah Sullivan</strong></p> <h2>Trinity Hospice Bookshop, Putney<br>208 Upper Richmond Road, SW15 6TD<br>020 8780 0737</h2> <p>Probably not a hot contender for 'Glamorous Book Shop of the Year', but definitely one to set the heart of any serious reader aflutter. Essentially one of the Trinity Hospice secondhand stores, but one that sells only music and books - at \u00a31 a book! As if that weren't enough, if you buy two books, you get one free! The books are divided into really logical sections (fiction, biography, classics, philosophy, children's and so on), and the shelves are pleasingly tidy. Whilst I haven't ventured into the great stacks of vinyl they do look tempting (unless you've never owned a record player like me!)<br><strong>Jo Arden</strong></p> <p>One of my favourite bookshops. I first heard of it through this database, and wanted to endorse it after many months of happy reading. Buying second-hand books from a charity is splendidly ethical, plus there is the added frisson of never knowing what you're going to find in this eccentric shop. I have strayed completely from my old reading patterns, and I feel better for it. I like being part of the cycle - buying books for only about \u00a31 is great, and it's also an easy way to donate old books yourself.<br><strong>Elke</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.grantandcutler.com/\">Grant &amp; Cutler, Soho</a><br>55-57 Great Marlborough Street, London W1F 7AY<br>020 7734 2012</h2> <p>I have to nominate Grant &amp; Cutler. As a Spanish undergraduate, I have found no better bookshop for supplying me with not only my course texts but also a full range of European literature for personal reading. Fab shop, great selection of books and really well-trained, helpful and professional staff. Love it there and would recommend to anyone!<br><strong>Louise Ticehurst</strong></p> <p>My favourite independent bookshop. Not only do they have everything you would expect to find, but such is the size of their stock that they have lots of niche titles which are a bit off the beat-and-track. The staff are really helpful with lots of knowledge and experience in foreign language literature, and it's generally a nice place to browse for a good read.<br><strong>Tom Smith</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.josephsbookstore.com/\">Joseph's Bookstore, Temple Fortune</a><br>1255-57 Finchley Road, NW11 0AD<br>020 8731 7575</h2> <p>To my mind, in terms of books of Jewish interest, both fiction and non-fiction, Joseph's has no equal in the UK. Just as importantly, its stock of contemporary British literature is exemplary. It is also one of the very few independent bookshops which has a considerable range of world literature. Over the years, it has become a prominent venue for book launches and important lectures and in the true tradition of Jewish hospitality, it offers to the hungry and thirsty book-lover a wonderfully atmospheric cafe specialising in delicious Mediterranean cuisine.<br><strong>Moris Farhi</strong></p> <p>Joseph's Bookstore is not my nearest bookshop, nor is it the largest, but the reason why I sometimes cycle half-way across London to browse their shelves is because this is a bookshop that really cares about their customers and which has excelled in creating a community of booklovers. For aspiring writers, Michael Joseph, the owner of the shop, is a wonderful source of advice and information about agents and publishers. They run events that relate to a wide range of interests, have opened a cafe and everyone who works in the store is familiar with their stock and will talk through appropriate choices with their customers.<br><strong>Naomi Gryn</strong></p> <p>Everything in Michael Joseph's bookshop expresses his sensibility. The fastidious grouping of books by subject matter, grounded in Jewishness - his shop is the pride of Golders Green - but also cosmopolitan and humanistic, a gathering of good neighbours. He leavens familiar English titles with judiciously-chosen imports from America and Israel. The clapboard walls are hung with a changing display of prints and paintings you wouldn't mind owning. Each week the shelves are pushed back to make way for a stream of readings, debates and jazz. And up two steps is Michael's Cafe Also, where you can eat Turkish mezze and textured fishcakes. I warm to Joseph's Bookstore because as well as being a customer's pleasure, it seems to delight its rangy, voluble, seemingly ever-present owner and impressario.<br><strong>Michael Kustow</strong></p> <p>For me the shop is rather like Dr Who's Tardis: the exterior doesn't prepare one for the interior! The wide variety of titles available are thoughtfully chosen, always including less well-known or emerging writers; this has singlehandedly expanded my reading experience. Joseph's is a refreshing antidote to the chains that dominate most high streets - yes, they have their place, but they simply can't compete with specialist staff who seem to really care. And if I want a book that's out of stock, they always manage to find a copy for me in a very short space of time. A visit to the shop is always a positive experience.<br><strong>Gaby Morris</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.wimbledonbooksandmusic.co.uk/\">Wimbledon Books and Music</a><br>40 High Street, Wimbledon, SW19 5AU<br>020 8879 3101</h2> <p>Wimbledon Village boasts a new, elegant and friendly bookshop in which browsers, as they select a book, can catch a glimpse of the local horses trotting by. Light and airy with comfortable sofas, the shop has a varied selection of interesting books including an unusually comprehensive children's section, as well as classical CDs and cards. Customers receive a very personal service from the charming owner and his wife, who encourage quiet browsing. There are regular story hours for young children and the atmosphere is worlds away from the noisy hustle of the big book chains.<br><strong>Prof Peter Armstrong </strong></p>",

Sea levels along Sydney's coast are expected to rise by up to 40 cm above 1990 levels by 2050 and by 90cm by 2100, with each one centimetre of rise resulting in one metre of erosion on low-lying beaches, said the report from the New South Wales Department of Climate Change.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?xml=/earth/2008/10/29/scichimp129.xml\">Chimps 'keep mental record of helpful acts'</a><br>Source: Telegraph</strong><br>Scientists have discovered that chimpanzees keep a mental record of helpful acts so they can return a favour, a study claims.

The fish are being used to feed pigs, chickens and farm-raised fish, researchers wrote in a study in the Annual Review of Environment and Resources. So-called forage fish account for 37% of all fish taken from the world's oceans each year, the study said.

It has lost none of its charm in the 25 years I have been frequenting it, and under the energetic vision of its new manager it looks set to continue the tradition established by Mr Moore. It lies in one of Hitchin's most characterful locations, and houses more books than you could dream of, in what are two adjoining cottages. A stone's throw from the market place, but inhabiting the old centre frequented by Elizabethan George Chapman, it has an earthy olde worlde feel impossible to imitate or recapture in a dull hybrid global chain, and is now open on Sundays, when I will take my baby boy to browse when he grows older. The shop holds titles as diverse as first editions of cult local historian Reginald Hine and fantastic zipgun affordable paperbacks.

It buys up your old books in piles; it organises debates on topics of national or local interest; it sponsors book-readings, talks and book launches by locally-based authors; it gives 10% discounts to members of the Letchworth leisure and recreation group that itself sponsors many activities; twice a year it has days when it sells all books at 30% or 50% off; it opens seven days a week and stays open for long hours - and if you're lucky it may even give your teenage son or daughter a holiday job.<br><strong>Andrew Tarnowski</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.altonbooks.co.uk/\">Little Green Dragon Bookshop, Alton</a><br>3 Normandy Street, Alton, Hampshire, GU34 1DD<br>01420 87801</h2> <p>This little gem of a bookshop is shot through with the personal touch of its owners, Jackie and Christine. It is small, cosy and welcoming, while housing a seemingly impossible range of books: reference, classics, the interesting but little known, and titles that are currently making the news. Knowledgeable advice is always available for those seeking ideas and inspiration. Telephone or email orders arrive within a couple of days, postage free. The shop is intimately involved in the life of the town as a meeting point and nerve centre, hosting literary events, acting as box office for local productions, and supporting local authors. It is also the place to go for cards, wrapping paper, and especially for high quality art materials. It is always a joy to visit, but like most such establishments it needs all the support it so richly deserves.<br><strong>James Willis</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://fordingbridgebooks.tbpcontrol.co.uk/tbp.web/customeraccesscontrol/home.aspx?d=fordingbridgebooks&amp;s=C&amp;r=10000135&amp;ui=0&amp;bc=0\">Fordingbridge Bookshop, Fordingbridge</a><br>15 Salisbury Street, Fordingbridge, Hampshire, SP6 1AB<br>01425 653725</h2> <p>I first entered this bookshop at the age of 11. \"I've got to write down the books I want for this prize I won at school,\" I told the shop owner, in a trembling voice, \"but then they buy them somewhere else so I won't actually spend the money here.\" She spent over an hour helping me search her stock for books I really wanted to own. The result? A devoted customer. Twenty years, two undergraduate degrees and one PhD later, I have found no better bookshop, even in Oxford or Cambridge. Swift, efficient, friendly.

They all have books, so what makes this one the best? It is its ethos, its ambience, the experience of bookishness. Do they have absolutely everything? No. But can they get it and ring next day to say its in? Yes! I want a bookshop with a smile, to be welcomed, to know names, to get advice, comment, reviews. I want a cup of coffee I want to find like-minded people. And a book club evening meeting. And an art gallery.

As you walk in you are greeted by friendly staff. The husband-and-wife owners are young and very down to earth. If you are looking for anything in particular they will go out of their way to help you, and if they don't stock the books you want, you can order them knowing that they'll be in by the next day. They stock a good range of children's, teenage, and adult books along with non-fiction. On the second floor they have maps and travel books as well as CDs and artist materials. The atmosphere is quiet and relaxed and they cater for people of all ages. On Wednesday mornings they have story time, to which you can bring your toddlers and rest from your shopping on the second floor in their fairtrade caf\u00e9, in which the coffees, juices and biscuits are all fairtrade while the wonderful cakes are all home made. The prices are all very reasonable.

In some ways, it's more a lifestyle choice than a bookshop, but it's great to have a little bit of independent thought in the middle of a sprawling town.<br>Becky John</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.bookwells.co.uk/\">P &amp; G Wells Ltd, Winchester</a><br>11 College Street, Winchester, Hampshire, SO23 9LZ<br>01962 852016</h2> <p>Surrounded by the formal medieval buildings of Winchester College, the slightly austere fa?e of the P&amp;G Wells bookshop makes it look quite at home. Inside there is a good range of contemporary fiction and biography, but where Wells really comes up trumps is with its children's section: the first floor is completely dedicated to books for kids of all ages. The history, philosophy and classical sections are also strong (Wells still supplies all the educational books for the college next door) and for real bibliophiles there's a bookbinding and restoration workshop at the back of the shop.<br><strong>Sam Spedding</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.beckenhambooks.co.uk/\">The Beckenham Bookshop, Beckenham</a><br>42 High Street, Beckenham, Kent, BR3 1AY<br>020 8650 9744</h2> <p>A suburban high street can still be a treat to shop on, especially if there is a good bookshop to visit. Beckenham is a town with just such a thing. It is a small shop but manages to have a great range of books and really friendly and helpful staff. One of the most remarkable things is their willingness to order books for you that mostly turn up the very next day. The first time you get a phone call to say your book is in, just 24 hours after ordering it, is quite staggering. They also have a mailing list and once you join that you can expect a regular supply of news about new books and events at the shop.<br><strong>Peter Starky</strong></p> <p>Our friendly little bookshop offers a brilliant variety of books. I particularly like browsing the new titles there, and the excellent range of children's books. As a literature student, I order all the books I need from the store and always receive them within two days. As well as being an excellent bookshop, the owners have made the shop a real community commodity through regular newsletters (you can sign up when browsing in the shop) highlighting new books and offers.

A small shop, independently owned and run by a delightful woman with a wonderful accent, with helpers who take an interest and know their stock. There is always something good to browse, and if they don't have what you're looking for, will get it quickly and without fuss. They will even post it to you if you don't want to collect.

Spend hours browsing shelves packed with everything from bestsellers to the quirky and unusual, such as titles from the beautifully produced Persephone Books, which publishes 'forgotten fiction and non-fiction by unjustly neglected authors'. Local authors, book readings and signings feature regularly. There is a discount scheme plus a fast and efficient ordering service, as well as a website for online browsers.

They know the book you want almost before you describe it, the staff are consistently available, welcoming, knowledgeable and infinitely tolerant of dogs, children and foibles. Their eclectic customers are dedicated, demanding and never disappointed - the shop even has a loyalty card scheme. It's been the same for years - after all, why change a winning formula? It's the jewel in the crown in our high street. You can happily spend hours there.<br><strong>The Sevenoaks Book Club</strong></p> <p>Sevenoaks is blessed with the best bookshop for 50 miles - and we are only 25 miles from Charing Cross. No bookshop is better than its people, and that is where they have the edge. The co-proprietors wear their ownership lightly, and inspire loyalty in their predominently long-serving staff. Mere competence, even of the highest order, is subordinate to the evident desire to serve, however trifling the request and however great the provocation. Any modest shortcomings are at once made good with unfailingly good-natured charm.<br><strong>Michael Howard</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.hallsbookshop.com/\">Halls Bookshop, Tunbridge Wells</a><br>20 Chapel Place, Tunbridge Wells, Kent, TN1 1YQ<br>01892 527 842</h2> <p>Established in 1898, Halls is a fantastic secondhand bookshop that sells everything from antiquarian rarities to 50p bargains. The two floors contain excellent literature, biography, history and travel sections, as well as many other subjects. Halls boasts as good a selection as many of the antiquarian bookshops on Charing Cross Road, but at half the price and with none of the attitude.<br><strong>Rupert Russell</strong></p> <h2>Bookist, Whitstable<br>138 Tankerton Road, Whitstable, Kent, CT5 2AN<br>01227 272454</h2> <p>I heartily recommend Bookist, a superb new and remaindered bookshop. The pleasing depth of children's titles, large print and non-fiction books is excellent. They specialise in hard-to-find, and the prices when they do find is great. They import remainders from Canada and the US with pricing that shames other shops! There's an obligatory leather sofa for rainy afternoons. Each time I visit I buy a book even though I've only stopped for a browse - today I completed my son's collection of Simpsons books and bought five jacketless hardbacks at ?1.99 each. Now there's a bargain!<br><strong>Becky Talbot</strong></p> <h2>Harbour Books, Whitstable<br>21 Harbour St, Whitstable, Kent, CT5 1AQ<br>01227 264011</h2> <p>I love Harbour Books because it's conveniently located on the way from my house to anywhere in Whitstable. It stocks cheap copies of some wonderful books: I've recently bought David Mitchell's Cloud Atlas, a whole load of Alan Hollinghursts, a couple of Angela Carters and Gillian Slovo's (Ice Road). These may not be your taste, but they have loads of other stuff too. Harbour Books is tiny, but the staff are lovely. After only a couple of nudges, they've started a shelf on \"lesbian and gay interest\" books, which, considering they're the size of a postage stamp, is very cool of them.<br><strong>Emily Grabham</strong></p> <h2>Houben's Bookshop, Richmond<br>2 Church Court, Surrey, TW9 1JL</h2> <p>Houben's is a brilliant combination bookshop with an eclectic selection of new books on the ground floor and an equally eclectic selection of used books in the basement. Upstairs, the shop contains a strong philosophy section, quirky fiction choices and a good assortment of Folio Society publications. However, the real gems are in the basement. There's a fabulous selection of nicely priced classics (they obviously have a good eye for interesting editions and bindings, as well as unusual titles), poetry and a well-honed fiction section. I have never left the shop empty-handed.<br><strong>Kate Eberwein</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://muchadobooks.com/index.php\">Much Ado Books, Alfriston</a><br>1 Steamer Cottage, High Street, Alfriston, East Sussex, BN26 5TY<br>01323 871 222</h2> <p>Owned and run by my dear friends Cate Olson and Nash Robbins, Much Ado is a bright, unexpectedly large shop in a 14th-century building combining new books with secondhand, and packed with interesting stock. Please don't tell the owners they ought to have a cafe (it drives them nuts) but you can see why people suggest it. It's a shop where you want to take your time, have a sit-down, read all morning. Very good on fiction, Bloomsbury, children's. Did you know Stella Gibbons wrote Cold Comfort Farm in Alfriston? You learn something new every day.<br><strong>Lynne Truss</strong></p> <h2>Arundel Bookshop, Arundel<br>10 High Street, Arundel, West Sussex, BN18 9AB<br>01903 882680</h2> <p>The best secondhand bookshop in Britain - outside Hay, anyway. Catch the train from Victoria and spend the day there. When I was working at the youth hostel in Arundel, I spent many happy hours reading on the dusty stairs during my afternoons off. Much of the stuff hasn't been opened for years.<br><strong>Ros Taylor</strong></p> <p>The Arundel Bookshop, which Ros Taylor enjoyed visiting, clearly some years ago, has changed hands. It is now called Kim's Bookshop, and still has a huge and varied wealth of books on the shelves, but has been tidied, so no longer has dusty stairs.<br><strong>Jeffery Meddle</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.city-books.co.uk/\">City Books, Brighton</a><br>23 Western Rd, Brighton, East Sussex, BN3 1AF<br>01273 725306</h2> <p>As a reader I can get lost for hours in the store - with its glorious odour of book - as a writer this is the way I want my books sold. Paul Sweetman is as knowledgeable about books as anyone can be and still have bones rather than pages. He persuades the world's writers to talk about their work in an un-stagemanaged fashion that leaves the multiples lagging. City Books allowed me to laugh at Alexander McCall Smith's tales of bassoon playing and marvelled at Louis de Berniere's thoughtful, elegant answers to questions about magical realism and political activism.<br><strong>Kay Sexton</strong></p> <p>Everything a bookshop should be. Going for at least 30 years, it is small, helpful and restful, with an excellent, well-edited choice of modern fiction, children's reading, cult, reference, local authors and fantastic ordering service and frequent reader promotion. Excellent selection of cards (including self-published) and it now has smart coffee and buns upstairs in the philosophy department so there is no need to go home, ever. In-house dog. Right next to the pub.<br><strong>Viv Croot</strong></p> <h2>Mungle's Jungle, Brighton<br>12 Guildford Road, Brighton, East Sussex, BN1 3FA<br>01273 739373</h2> <p>Mungle's Jungle, a fantastic little children's bookshop by anyone's standards, is elevated far beyond the competition purely on the basis of its proprietor, Jane Shepard. The shop, although small, is always well stocked, but Jane's knowledge and enthusiasm are key here, never failing to find the perfect book for any request. Running a story time for kids on a Saturday afternoon, she is passionate about instilling a love of reading in children of all ages and this shines through in everything she does. Simply a wonderful little shop.<strong>Dan Slessor</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.kemptownbookshop.co.uk/\">Kemptown Bookshop, Brighton<br>91 St. George's Rd, Brighton, East Sussex, BN2 1EE<br>01273 682110</a></h2> <p>In this lovely bookshop, the genuinely warm friendliness of proprietor Darion Goodwin and his ever-happy dog, Meghan, provide a much-needed oasis from all the impersonal book-hypermarkets. The knowledgeable selection of titles is a testament to Mr. Goodwin's passion for books. Upstairs is the shop's own Bookroom Cafe which is elegant and serene; while surrounded by even more books, you can relax with a fine range of pastries and light refreshments. A second-hand and out-of print book ordering service, greeting cards and book-related gifts mean Kemptown bookshop meets all your reading requirements. This really is a booklover's bookshop.<br><strong>Isobel Hiom</strong></p> <h2>Bookstack, Eastbourne<br>67-68 Arndale Centre, East Sussex, BN21 3NW<br>01323 430 554</h2> <p>This independent has taken on the big discounters and survived. Sandwiched between branches of Sussex Stationers and Ottakar's, with a WHSmith and Waterstone's not far away, he manages to keep a good selection of bestsellers and non-fiction, much of it as discounted as at his competitors.. For me, the best feature is the slightly quirky collection of non-fiction, particularly art titles, although he also has a good range of cookery, military history, education/reference and local interest. If you like popular fiction, this is discounted, with plenty of classics as well. Upstairs there is a lovely little cafe, with cakes made by a local woman and free coffee refills, as well as the day's papers, local and national. A civilised refuge in a wilderness of Mothercare, Next, and assorted teen fashion shops.<br><strong>Denise Scott Fears</strong></p> <h2>Camilla's Bookshop, Eastbourne<br>57 Grove Road, Eastbourne, East Sussex<br>01323 736001</h2> <p>This amazing secondhand bookshop greets you with books piled all over the floor, and floor-to-ceiling bookshelves. It is a wonderful labyrinthine cavern to lose yourself in for hours on its three floors (don't miss the basement). Books on all topics imaginable and staff who seem to know where every one is. When I'm having a bad day I like to go in there for a browse, knowing I won't be able to leave without buying some gem or other. I have been known to compete with friends over who will come out with a famous pink carrier bag. Not usually a problem to fill one!<br><strong>Karen Hampson</strong></p> <h2>Spearman Books, Robertsbridge<br>Mellstock, Saxonwood Road, Robertsbridge, East Sussex, TN33 0EY<br>01424773300</h2> <p>Spearman Books is thoroughly recommended to all second-hand book browsers. The small village shop has a wide and very reasonably priced selection ranging from classic children's books, novels and hardback volumes - particularly Kipling - to art books and first editions. There is a wide selection of books on the military and local history. The owners, Janet and John, are exceptionally helpful and well informed and will order books for you if they can not be found.

  "<p>Alistair Darling will insist today that a new approach to public finances is needed to combat the economic downturn. </p> <p>With the government planning to increase borrowing to spend its way out of an almost certain recession, the chancellor will say that fiscal policy must support efforts to shore up the economy. </p> <p>\"Just as markets change, so should policy,\" he will tell the Cass business school in his annual Mais lecture. </p> <p>But Darling was warned by the Tories today that any \"spending splurge\" would damage Britain's economic outlook still further and reduce the scope for interest rate cuts. </p> <p>Writing in <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2008/10/29/do2904.xml\">the Daily Telegraph, the shadow chancellor, George Osborne</a>, said that the scrapping of Gordon Brown's fiscal rules would destroy \"the final remaining pillar\" of his economic legacy. <br> But Darling will argue tonight that policy on taxation and expenditure should reflect the \"exceptional\" circumstances and that such shifts in thinking are necessary across the world. </p> <p>The chancellor will say that governments across the globe are adopting approaches that had until recently been consigned to \"policymaking history\".</p> <p>\"It is natural that the conduct of policy should evolve,\" he will say.</p> <p>\"Three weeks ago, we worked with other countries to put in place a plan to stabilise the banking system. These countries are committed to working together to strengthen supervision in the global financial system. </p> <p>\"And today we need the same determination to support the wider economy. To ensure that fiscal policy supports monetary policy, here and across the world, in these exceptional circumstances.\" </p> <p>His comments will echo those of the prime minister, who insisted yesterday that the government met its fiscal rules over the economic cycle but that the country was now in \"unique times\". </p> <p>Brown said: \"We have never had a situation where what has come together is a trebling of oil prices and now an oil shock and volatile oil prices with an international financial crisis that started from America. </p> <p>\"In those circumstances, what we have got to do is what is right for the economy and what is right for hard-working families and for businesses and for homeowners, to get the economy moving again.\"</p> <p>Osborne raised the prospect of a decade-long economic decline should the government increase spending by borrowing more. </p> <p>He wrote in the Telegraph that this would be \"exactly the wrong approach\", adding: \"The policies that got us into this mess cannot be the ones to get us out of it. </p> <p>\"It doesn't work. Look at Japan. Between 1992 and 2002, Japanese government net debt grew by 58% of GDP. Over the same decade the economy only grew by 9%. </p> <p>\"The end result was a crippling debt burden and a landscape littered with the evidence of endless white-elephant public works programmes.\" </p> <p>Osborne added that increased debt would leave the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee less able to cut interest rates. </p> <p>The fiscal rules, now likely to be officially ditched in the forthcoming pre-budget report, were introduced by Brown as chancellor in 1997. </p> <p>They require the government to only borrow to invest over an economic cycle and to keep debt below 40% of national income.<br> The director of the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies, Robert Chote, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that, even in the event of a mild economic slowdown, debt was probably heading over 40% over the next couple of years or so. </p> <p>\"It is going to head considerably higher than that as a result of the depth of the recession we are going to be confronting - that's leaving aside the effect of nationalising Northern Rock etc,\" said Chote.</p> <p>\"On the golden rule, it is hard to imagine a set of dates for the economic cycle looking ahead where the government will be able to keep to that.\" </p> <p>Chote said the Treasury had held \"too optimistic\" an outlook for public finances over the past seven budgets.</p> <p>This had in effect exhausted the room for manoeuvre by the time the country reached the unexpected financial crisis, he said. </p> <p>\"The challenge is to improve people's confidence that the rules will be a meaningful constraint on tax and spending decisions in the future. </p> <p>\"There is clearly a concern that borrowing is going to leap dramatically anyway, and the government may even wish to pump a bit more spending power into the economy in the short term, because of the concern that it may not be sensible just to rely on cuts in interest rates if the banks may not pass them on, so that makes it all the more important that people are confident things will get back into shape once the situation improves.\" </p> <p>Darling's call for concerted international action comes as Brown is also appealing for hundreds of billions of dollars in additional assistance for the International Monetary Fund.</p> <p>The prime minister warned yesterday that the 250 billion-dollar fund currently available to the IMF to lend to financially stricken states \"may not be enough\".</p>",

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/mortgages\">Mortgage</a> lending edged up in September, figures published by the Bank of England showed today. </p> <p>The value of net mortgage lending, which takes into account repayments and redemptions, increased by \u00a32.2bn compared with a fall of \u00a30.7bn in August. Lenders approved 33,000 loans in September, up from 32,000 in August. </p> <p>However, the figures are still considerably below the previous six-month average, reflecting the continued shortage of funding for buyers. Mortgage lending increased by \u00a33.5bn a month on average over the previous six months, and an average 43,000 loans were approved for home purchases each month. </p> <p>The number of mortgages approved in the third quarter of the year is a fraction of those granted in the same period last year, as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">credit crunch</a> keeps a tight grip on the housing market. Just 98,000 home loans were approved for purchase between July and September compared with 101,000 in September last year alone.</p> <p>There were 72,000 remortgage loans approved in September, up from 64,000 in August but still very low compared with an average of 82,000 over the previous six months. </p> <p>Howard Archer, chief UK economist at Global Insight, said the data remained \"very weak.\"</p> <p>\"Despite the very limited improvement from August, the Bank of England mortgage data for September still showed that housing market activity continued to be decimated by the highly damaging combination of stretched buyer affordability and tight lending practices,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Together with the deepening economic downturn, this reinforces pressure on the Bank of England to cut interest rates by at least a further 50 basis points from 4.5% to 4.00% at its November policy meeting next month.\"</p> <p>Separate figures from the Building Societies Association (BSA) also showed an increase in mortgage lending. Net lending increased to \u00a3314m in September, compared with -\u00a337m in August, but were considerably lower than the \u00a3592m lent in September 2007, the BSA said.</p> <p>Director general, Adrian Coles, said: \"With the housing market depressed as house prices continue falling and with confidence amongst potential home buyers low, it is no surprise that mortgage lending is down on last year, and the mortgage market is unlikely to recover for some time.</p> <p>\"Nevertheless, the increase in net lending in September is to be welcomed.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Bank of England also said consumer lending through <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/loans\">personal loans</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/creditcards\">credit cards</a> increased by just \u00a30.3bn compared with an increase of \u00a31.1bn in each of the previous six months.</p>",
  "<p>Porsche today set out to calm volatile trading in Volkswagen shares by making up to 5% of VW stock available to desperate short-sellers.</p> <p>A day after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/29/vw-volkswagen-porsche-takeover\">VW shares rose as high as \u20ac1,005 each</a>, making the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/germany\">German</a> cars group the world's most valuable company, Porsche said its move \"may result in an increase in the liquidity of the Volkswagen ordinary shares\".</p> <p>The effect was immediate, with VW shares falling almost \u20ac350 or 37% to \u20ac596 in early trading compared with yesterday's closing price of \u20ac945. VW is now valued at \u20ac178bn compared with a high of \u20ac296bn (\u00a3240bn).</p> <p>Porsche, under attack for its multibillion gains from using obscure derivative instruments, has denied allegations of market manipulation or insider trading.</p> <p>Its Sunday night announcement it controlled 74.1% of VW stock sent hedge funds, which had bet on a collapse in VW shares in line with the global auto industry's downturn, into despair. It reduced the amount of VW shares in free float down to 5.7%.</p> <p>Several leading funds are estimated to have lost up to \u20ac5bn when their short-selling turned toxic, with the total losses calculated at anything between \u20ac20bn and \u20ac30bn.</p> <p>The turbulence on the Frankfurt stock exchange in the last two days, which has seen frantic traders dump other leading stocks in the Dax-30, has forced Deutsche Boerse to reduce VW's weighting in the index closer to 10% from next Monday. It rose yesterday to 27%, dragging the entire bourse into disrepute.</p>",
  "<p><strong>October 28 session</strong></p> <p><strong>Climate change bill</strong><br>The government made key concessions to include aviation and shipping emissions within the landmark climate change bill. The move followed a campaign by environmentalists and a threatened Labour rebellion. Under amendments, the climate change committee will be required to consider the emissions when setting carbon budgets.</p> <p>Climate change minister Joan Ruddock said: \"We agree that action to reduce emissions from international aviation and shipping will be vital to global efforts to tackle climate change.\" The government agreed that those emissions should \"either be included in the bill's targets and budgets ... or an explanation should be laid before parliament explaining why this has not been done\".</p> <p>Tory spokesman Gregory Barker said: \"We warmly welcome the government's change of heart and measured response to include emissions from international aviation and shipping in the climate change bill.\"</p> <p>The climate change secretary, Ed Miliband, said: \"This will make us the first country in the world to enshrine in law binding climate change targets and stretching ambitious targets, and they need to be so, to 80% by 2050.\" The bill was given a third reading by 463 votes to three.</p> <p><strong>'Smart meters'</strong><br>The government announced plans to install gas and electricity \"smart meters\" in all homes by 2020. Smart meters allow two-way communication between the user and the supplier and can display information such as daily usage and the cost of energy being used. Energy minister Lord Hunt of Kings Heath said: \"No other country in the world has moved to an electricity and gas smart meter roll-out on this scale.\"</p> <p><strong>Early release of prisoners</strong><br>The justice secretary, Jack Straw, was accused of being \"astonishingly complacent\" following revelations that prisoners released early under a controversial scheme were alleged to have committed three murders. For the Tories, Nick Herbert said the government was \"clearly putting the public at risk\" and called for the end of custody licence scheme to be scrapped.</p> <p>Straw expressed \"regret\" over the scheme, which allows offenders to be released 18 days early, and said he wanted to see it wound up. He said he wanted to end the scheme \"as soon as there is sufficient prison capacity to do so\".</p> <p><strong>Plans to buy private jets</strong><br>The Liberal Democrat transport spokesman, Norman Baker, demanded an inquiry into why \u00a31.25m was spent on government analysis into plans to buy two private jets for the prime minister and royal family. Plans for the jets - dubbed Blair Force One - were scrapped in March following a year-long analysis by the transport department.</p> <p>Transport minister Jim Fitzpatrick said: \"We see no need for an internal inquiry.\"</p> <p><strong>Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand</strong><br>Justice minister David Hanson urged Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand to apologise for the offensive phone calls made to veteran actor Andrew Sachs. <br>Hanson said he did not think the two broadcasters' behaviour was \"appropriate\" or \"in keeping with broadcasting\". He told MPs: \"I'm not sure it will result in prosecutions. But I do feel an apology is called for.\"</p> <p><strong>Reoffending rates</strong><br>Edward Garnier, for the Tories, accused the government of not doing enough to cut reoffending rates by helping offenders to acquire new skills in prison. He hit out at ministerial \"incompetence\" over the provision of \"purposeful activity\" in prisons.</p> <p>Hanson said crime overall was down 39% since 1997 and reoffending figures were also down over the last six years. He added that each prisoner currently undertook 25.3 hours of purposeful activity per week. \"That's a steady figure and one I want to increase.\"</p> <p><strong>Landsbanki</strong><br>Use of anti-terrorism powers to freeze UK assets of the Icelandic bank Landsbanki was perhaps \"inelegant\" and \"uncomfortable\" but it \"was highly effective in protecting the interests of British depositors and the British economy\", the Treasury financial services secretary, Lord Myners, said. He was outlining the Landsbanki freezing order and an amendment to the order, which both came into force within hours of being laid.</p> <p><strong>Parliament Square protesters</strong><br>The government must consult with Commons authorities over laws designed to deal with protesters in Parliament Square, Speaker Michael Martin ruled. He was responding to complaints that anti-war protesters were using loud hailers \"persistently, incessantly and at unreasonable volume\".</p> <p><strong>Metropolitan Black Police Association</strong><br>Home Office minister Lord West of Spithead described as \"outrageous\" and \"damaging\" the Metropolitan Black Police Association's attempts to persuade ethnic minorities not to join the force.</p> <p><strong>GBL</strong><br>A legal \"date rape drug\" that is widely available for sale on the internet should be banned, the government was urged. Labour former Home Office minister Joan Ryan (Enfield N) said the colourless and odourless GBL, known as \"liquid ecstasy\", can render victims incapable of resisting sexual advances.</p> <p><strong>Chinese army officer cadets training at Sandhurst</strong><br>The government's decision to allow Chinese army officer cadets to train at Sandhurst flouts a European Union ban and could jeopardise military cooperation with the US, Tory Ben Wallace (Lancaster and Wyre) warned. Officer cadet Liu Liu passed out of the prestigious military training college this summer as a result of what Wallace said was a \"dangerous and silly\" programme of cooperation with the People's Liberation Army.</p> <p>Armed forces Minister Bob Ainsworth said Wallace's claims were \"palpable nonsense\" designed to stir up trouble.<br></p>",
  "<p>Over the last 30 years, each and every major international financial crisis has visited Hungary. In 1982, right after Poland; in 1994, right after Mexico; and in 2008, right after Iceland. Always, and rapidly, the road has led to the International Monetary Fund.</p> <p>This is a special relationship indeed, and also a turbulent one. Most of the former Eastern Bloc countries joined the IMF and the World Bank after 1989, but Hungary did so as early as 1982. It helped to push forward market reforms that others were yet to adopt, and thus Hungary became a model pupil of neoliberalism in the region. It did not, however, help the country get out of its massive foreign debt. Hungary entered the post-communist \"new era\" with the highest per capita foreign debt and, unlike Poland, the government decided to refrain from potential debt reduction schemes put forward by George Soros among others.</p> <p>Despite being the most economically advanced of the countries that joined the EU in 2004, Hungary has always remained the most financially vulnerable. In the early period, debt to GDP increased rather than decreased, and the Maastricht type debt ratio only reduced (to about 51%) in a period of extraordinary foreign direct investment in the late 1990s. As other nations made themselves available for transnational corporations, however, this competitive edge vanished.</p> <p>There are further reasons why Hungary has turned out to be the region's weakest link in the current international financial crisis. Since GDP only caught up with the 1989 level in 1999, successive governments turned to risky financial solutions to improve the popular feelgood factor. One government unleashed reckless subsidy schemes for home builders and buyers; another increased public sector wages by 50%. Meanwhile, an ambitious road construction programme left Hungary with the best highway network in the region, but at the price of skyrocketing state debt.</p> <p>It was, however, not only fiscal policy that contributed to its fatal fragility; monetary policy also played a part. In 2001, the central bank (MNB) adopted the \"inflation targeting\" paradigm, which was never invented for small, open economies, totally dependent on foreign trade, investment and finance. MNB did not give up on this concept even in the spring of this year, when central banks around the world had repeatedly reduced interest rates. </p> <p>Similarly, nothing happened to reduce the amount of foreign exchange-based domestic lending, which was pointed out several times by international observers as a source of financial instability \u2013 and which also contributed to the unsustainable strength of the forint.</p> <p>Add the hostility and lack of cooperation, sometimes even dialogue, between the two main political parties, plus the uncertainty around the minority government currently in office, and you can understand how comparison is possible with Ukraine or Pakistan, alongside whom we currently sit in the IMF emergency room.</p> <p>What is different from previous crises is the global financial architecture \u2013 ie the collection of multilateral institutions, as well as governments, that step forward for stabilisation against the unprecedented hysteria of transnational private finance. Also, the relationship between the IMF and particular clients is also affected by the fact that the IMF is not the only player in town. Sovereign wealth funds have joined the picture, albeit with an unclarified role so far. This may affect the conditionality of IMF loans and prevent a replay of the 1980s, when all costs of the reckless lending by multinational banks were pushed on emerging economies, which suffered depression and disintegration as a result.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the emerging Hungarian package is largely based on the old orthodoxy. This is probably because, of the three main areas of earlier overspending (housing, motorways and wage increases), the third is the one that can be most easily driven out of existence. This will be seen as ruthless, primarily because the country has just left behind two years of deficit reduction from 10% to 3% of the GDP \u2013 a heroic achievement from the government and the people.</p> <p>The financial crisis in Hungary and across Europe also shows that the eurozone's enlargement strategy has to change. When the eight new countries joined the EU in 2004, they were obliged to sign up to the Economic and Monetary Union as well. They have to fulfil all the so-called Maastricht criteria (on debt, deficit, inflation, interest rates, exchange rate stability), and even the sustainability of those is under assessment \u2013 something that was not in fashion in the late 1990s, when the founding 12 created the zone.</p> <p>It should now be clear that crucifying new members on Maastricht criteria can cause disintegration in what should be the most dynamic part of the union. Because a high proportion of the Hungarian banking system is foreign owned (by Austrian, Italian and German banks), a financial crisis in Hungary cannot be isolated from the rest of the EU. The Maastricht criteria have to be shelved in order to maintain stability not just in Hungary, but in Europe as a whole, where major banks are exposed to serious risks in new member states. In other words, the collapse of emerging economies could trigger, as Susan George put it once, a boomerang effect.</p>",
  "<p></p> <p>The Championship can appear an enjoyable environment for refugees from the Premier League, but that is not Reading's experience in the last week. Their integration into the lower league has lately been seamless, their goalscoring habit mislaid and third place lost.</p> <p>QPR, lacking a manager, secured a stalemate at the Madejski Stadium on Saturday and Burnley, subjected to a matchday reshuffle and ending the game with two of their usual midfielders in the back four, married remarkable resilience with a late winner last night.</p> <p>Yet while Robbie Blake procured the three points, they were earned by Brian Jensen on an improbable evening. Until recently, Reading couldn't stop scoring. Last night they did everything but put the ball in the net. This was a display of resistance orchestrated by Jensen and aided by his goalposts, which denied Reading on three occasions.</p> <p>\"If the goal had been a couple of inches wider or bigger, it would have been a comfortable win for us,\" lamented Steve Coppell, the Reading manager.</p> <p>Had the keeper been a couple of inches smaller, it would have been similarly conclusive. Beginning with a double save to repel efforts from Jimmy K\u00e9b\u00e9 and Noel Hunt, Jensen's was a masterclass in defiance, especially when he pushed Andr\u00e9 Bikey's header on to the woodwork.</p> <p>Kevin Doyle was doubly unfortunate. When he collected Bikey's clearance, his sharp turn enabled him to elude the Burnley defence, but his shot rebounded off the inside of the post. The Irishman then clipped the bar with a looping header from James Harper's free-kick. The midfielder's set-piece delivery, allied to the pace of K\u00e9b\u00e9 on the right flank and the sharpness of Doyle, ensured they posed a threat, but with each missed opportunity, the frustration escalated.</p> <p>\"With the chances we had, we're bitterly disappointed,\" said Coppell, which was as much of an understatement as Owen Coyle's assertion that: \"Brian made a couple of good saves.\" Coyle was a contributor to victory himself. The Burnley manager is forging a reputation for his astute use of substitutes and the removal of his top scorer, Martin Paterson, for Blake was justified by the replacement's shot, struck with accuracy to nestle in the net. \"It was a sublime finish from Robbie,\" added Coyle.</p> <p>Burnley had their own opportunities, three falling to Steve Thompson in a moment of mayhem when attackers and defenders congregated, their proximity producing a version of penalty-area pinball. The Championship can be volatile but Burnley, who have bounced up to fifth, are savouring its unpredictability.</p>",

  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/football/premierleague\">Premier League</a>, the great, sparkling, global advert for Britain is, it seems, a standard-bearer for our deeply unequal society too. The pressure group Fair Pay Network is campaigning for Premier League clubs to pay \"a living wage\" to their programme sellers, cleaners and catering staff following a survey which found many of them were being paid the minimum wage of \u00a35.52 per hour; in the organisation's words, \"the lowest wage it is legally acceptable to pay\". </p> <p>This in a sport which pays its top star players a reported \u00a3160,000 a week, and bumper pay packages to directors - over \u00a31m a year for the chief executives of Manchester United, Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and the Premier League itself, Richard Scudamore. </p> <p>Fair Pay Network cites research by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation that \u00a35.52 an hour is not enough to live decently on; it leaves people in real, material poverty, and the network argues an hourly wage of \u00a37.45 in London, \u00a36.80 outside the capital, is the minimum necessary for a single person. The organisation found that many jobs advertised at Premier League clubs, often by companies contracted to provide catering at the grounds, were paying the minimum wage. Some were for people to serve in corporate hospitality areas, which, famously, symbolise the \"prawn sandwich\" culture of wealth at the top clubs. </p> <p>One advert for a kitchen porter to work at Heathcote's at Anfield, the fine-dining end of Liverpool's matchday experience, specified the wage was the legal minimum, \u00a35.52 per hour. An applicant for a job at Manchester United Conference and Banqueting was told the pay was: \"Dependent on area of work. However, most areas will follow the national minimum wage of \u00a35.52 per hour.\" </p> <p>Vacancies at Fulham this summer for people to serve food and drink from kiosks at the ground were advertised via an agency at \u00a36 an hour, while Spurs were looking for warehouse staff in their merchandise division to work for \u00a35.75 an hour. At Chelsea, owned by the Russian oligarch billionaire Roman Abramovich, Fair Pay Network found catering jobs being offered below the living wage. </p> <p>\"It is offensive,\" says Mark Donne, Fair Pay Network's director. \"Football must be one of the most unequal industries we have: an extremely wealthy sport with people servicing it who are living in working poverty.\"</p> <p>Last week the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, wrote to Abramovich at Chelsea and to Arsenal, Tottenham, Fulham and West Ham saying \"concerns have been raised with me about low-paid workers at London's five Premier League clubs\", calling on them to pay a \"living wage\". In a policy begun by his predecessor, Ken Livingstone, all Greater London Authority staff are paid at least the \u00a37.45 an hour \"London Living Wage\". Johnson argues, as does Fair Pay Network, that the clubs would themselves benefit if they paid more, because their staff would be more motivated and loyal.</p> <p>\"London's football clubs are an integral part of the social fabric of this city,\" Johnson wrote, \"the values they stand for and actions they take have a huge influence on millions of people.</p> <p>\"It would set a superb example for your club to agree to pay your low-paid workers - shop assistants, catering staff and cleaners - the London Living Wage, and I urge you to do so.\"</p> <p>The sports minister, Gerry Sutcliffe, also supports the living wage campaign, on the same basis: that the football clubs, so rich and bearing the names of their towns and cities, would set a notable example for decent pay to the country at large. No clubs, however, have yet committed to paying the \"living wage\", although Fair Pay Network says it is having positive discussions with Aston Villa and is hopeful that Villa will become the first.</p> <p>In response to the survey and campaign, the Premier League, speaking on the clubs' behalf, pointed to the \"substantial contribution\" the clubs make to the economy and pay in tax, and said: \"The clubs respect all the relevant employment laws.\" A spokesman suggested that if the government believes the minimum wage should be higher, it should pass a law to that effect: \"Statutory pay levels are a matter for government,\" he said. \"Perhaps this would be the most appropriate place for the Fair Pay Network to concentrate their campaign efforts.\"</p> <p>Scudamore himself, in a letter earlier this month to Alan Keen MP, chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Football Group, wrote that clubs do not have a problem recruiting at even the lowest-paid levels:</p> <p>\"In general clubs receive many applications for the available jobs, suggesting that terms and conditions are relatively attractive compared to other employment opportunities.\"</p> <p>Scudamore was paid a basic salary of \u00a3590,000 in the year to July 31 2007. He also received a bonus of \u00a3410,000 because of the television deals he secured for the clubs. In addition, \u00a3213,000 was paid into his pension, making his total remuneration \u00a31.2m. Sir Dave Richards, the Premier League's part-time chairman and only other director, was paid \u00a3261,000 for what the league says is a three-day week. </p> <p>The pay of Premier League directors (see below), which increased substantially at most clubs between 2006 and 2007 - and is likely to go up again because of the bigger, \u00a32.7bn TV deal which began last season - is mostly a great deal higher than the pay of directors at general companies with similar-sized turnovers. Peter Kenyon, Chelsea's chief executive, was the Premier League boardroom's highest earner on \u00a31.9m, followed by Manchester United's David Gill on \u00a31.48m, Liverpool's Rick Parry on \u00a31.12m, and Arsenal's managing director, Keith Edelman, whose total pay was \u00a31.056m in the 12 months to May 31 this year. </p> <p>According to the Chartered Management Institute, companies in the \"Big Four\" bracket, turning over between \u00a3100m and \u00a3249m annually, pay their chief executives on average \u00a3650,000. Spurs were the only other club which turned over more than \u00a3100m; chairman, Daniel Levy, was paid \u00a3950,000, an 18% increase on his 2006 pay packet of \u00a3775,000. </p> <p>Below those top clubs, chief executives' pay was still mostly higher than at non-football companies with similar turnover - and startlingly high for the best-paid directors at Sunderland, \u00a31.06m, and Portsmouth, \u00a3907,175. Neither club identified which director had been paid those packages, and Sunderland declined to discuss the disparity between the highest-paid millionaire director and the wages of the lowest paid at the Stadium of Light.</p> <p>Sources at some clubs justified the chief executives' pay by arguing that while it looks glamorous and enjoyable, the job is high pressure and demands a wide range of skills which only a few people have. </p> <p>A Manchester United spokesman said of the gap between Gill's salary and the minimum wage catering jobs: \"We are a global business and the challenge David Gill has in managing that is bigger than in an average \u00a3210m turnover business. But at all levels, people want to work for Manchester United. We pay the market rate for both jobs.\"</p> <p>Football, the national game, has always held a mirror to the nation. </p> <p><em>To read a copy of Boris Johnson's letter to London's Premier League chairmen, click <a href=\"http://image.theguardian.com/sys-files/Football/documents/2008/10/28/JohnsonLetter.pdf\">here</a>.

  "<p>The FTSE 100 ended with a modest recovery yesterday, underpinned by the strong overnight performance of the Asian markets. After a volatile day's trading, during which it surged past the 4000-point mark and dropped back into negative territory, the blue-chip index closed up 73.79 points at 3926.38.</p> <p>London's leading shares got off to a positive start thanks to the Asian markets: the Hang Seng in Hong Kong surged more than 14%, its biggest one-day rise since 1997, and Japan's Nikkei bounced back from Monday's 26-year low. Later, the Dow Jones industrial average opened strongly in New York, keeping the FTSE buoyant.</p> <p>Following better than expected figures from <strong>Aviva</strong>, financial stocks figured among the leading gainers and the top fallers as investors seemed puzzled as to how to value the sector. Aviva's chief executive, Andrew Moss, said the company's share price had been \"affected by the huge uncertainty in financial markets\" - and he reminded investors that the net asset value per share was 696p at September 30. Shares in Aviva closed up 13.75p at 259p.</p> <p><strong>Friends Provident</strong> was up 28% to 65p, while the car insurer <strong>Admiral</strong> saw shares rise 75.5p to 868.5p. The fallers included <strong>Legal &amp; General</strong>, dropping 8p to 60.9p, while <strong>Prudential</strong> slipped 28.25p to 248.25p.</p> <p>The Asian markets' revival helped the internationally focused banks <strong>HSBC</strong> and <strong>Standard Chartered</strong>, which have been suffering on fears that the recession will be a fully global phenomenon. HSBC's shares soared 20% in Hong Kong, which helped send them 15.25p higher in London to 678.25p. Standard Chartered closed up 20p at 700p, as it reported good progress in the third quarter of 2008. \"It is clear that Asian economic growth is moderating but in general the economies remain resilient and their economic growth rates remain well above the rates of growth for markets in the west,\" the bank said in a trading statement.</p> <p>The troubled high-street bank <strong>HBOS</strong> climbed 7.6p to 68.6p, narrowing the valuation gap with its merger partner, <strong>Lloyds TSB</strong>, down 7.4p to 162.5p. Lloyds' bid still values HBOS shares at 98.3p, so there is plenty of ground to be made up.</p> <p>Shares in <strong>ITV</strong> fell 2.75p to a new low of 26p after Fitch Ratings downgraded it from BB+ to BBB-. \"The events of the last six weeks suggest there is more than an outside chance that the current UK TV advertising downturn may be materially worse than those in 1990-91 and 2000-01,\" said Alex Griffiths, senior director in Fitch's TMT group in London.</p> <p><strong>Vodafone</strong> gained 6.05p to 110.55p despite renewed sell advice from Collins Stewart analyst Mark James, who cut his target from 108p to 90p.</p>",
  "<p>The civil service has always undergone reform, but the scale of the change in recent years, coupled with the fact that around a third of the public sector workforce is due to retire during the next five to 10 years means that there are not enough civil servants with experience of managing such wholesale reforms.</p> <p>Add to that big cuts in civil service numbers as a result of the government's efficiency drive since 2004, and it is clear Whitehall departments cannot rely on internal staff alone.</p> <p>They are increasingly turning to interim managers - \"highly qualified senior executives and managers, who work on a temporary basis to manage an identified business need or specific change project,\" according to the Office of Government Commerce.</p> <p>According to the Interim Management Association (IMA) - the organisation representing agencies that supply interims - central government accounts for around \u00a380m of the \u00a3400m the public sector spends annually on interim managers.</p> <p>In the civil service, the bulk of interim posts are in shared services, procurement and skills strategy, plus managing of large relocations of departments, restructuring and organisational development as regulators and quangos are merged or split. There is also high demand for interim executives in finance, HR and performance management.</p> <p>The IMA says interims are used most widely in the health, work and pensions departments, the Home Office and the Ministry of Defence. The Cabinet Office, Metropolitan Police, revenue and customs, environment, justice and local government departments also frequently rely on interims.</p> <p>Growing numbers of former public servants are turning to interim management. Before joining the Youth Justice Board earlier this year, Frances Done was interim chief executive of the British Legion, an experience she relished. \"It was a wonderful experience, and I wouldn't have missed it for anything,\" she says. \"I wanted more flexibility in my life but still wanted an interesting chief exec role. Interim management seemed to fit the bill because I could work very intensively for a period and then take a break. It was great to be able to use the skills and experience I had developed over 36 years and apply them in a new role, a new environment and try to make a real difference to the organisation in 6-9 months.\" Had the chair of the Youth Justice Board not come up, she says she would have carried on with interim chief executive roles.</p> <p>Interims have often worked at two levels above the role they go in at and have usually worked for four or five different organisations. As a result, they bring a broader business acumen to the assignment than if a permanent member of staff was doing the job.</p> <p>\"The truth is the civil service cannot attract the best talent the market has to offer on a permanent basis,\" says Charles Wilson, head of public sector at interim provider Penna.</p> <p>The attraction of interim managers is that they are much cheaper than management consultants. Typically, interim managers in the civil service earn \u00a3644 a day. Someone who goes in at a very senior level could expect to earn around \u00a31,000 to \u00a31,250 a day, whereas the minimum day rate for a management consultant is at least \u00a31,500-\u00a32,000.</p> <p>\"On average, interim managers cost two to three times less than management consultants,\" says Jason Atkinson, deputy chairman of the IMA. \"We see continued growth for interims in central government.\"</p> <p><strong>Cheaper and more cheerful</strong></p> <p>The nature of the job is also different. While a consultant's role is primarily to advise, the interim manager is hired to do a particular job. Done says interim managers are successful if they \"have the skills developed in more than one environment, are adaptable and flexible, can handle people well (board level and staff), and are willing to work very hard - which you have to do to make the impact needed\".</p> <p>There is usually a specific requirement to pass on their skills to their colleagues so there is a lasting legacy. In contrast, \"consultants are more protective of the intellectual property they bring in,\" says Clive Bennett, head of the government agencies practice at interim provider Ashton Penney. \"They are not presenting a nice report at the end of six months,\" says Stuart Cain, director at provider BIE Interim Executive. \"So every month when they bang their invoice on the desk, they will be expected to have delivered something.\"</p> <p>This is because consultants are accountable to their company, while interims effectively become temporary civil servants. There is therefore a much greater onus on them to get on with permanent staff and pass on their expertise. \"They don't have an axe to grind,\" says Atkinson.</p> <p>They also have a different mentality to permanent staff. \"The sort of people you would employ to lead a change programme are not the kind of people you'd want to give a job to,\" says Cain. \"They are agitators, too disruptive to employ permanently.\"</p> <p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p> <p>Ashton Penney interim provider: <a href=\"http://www.ashtonpenneyinterim.com\">ashtonpenneyinterim.com</a></p> <p>BIE Interim Executive interim provider: <a href=\"http://www.bieinterim.co.uk\">bieinterim.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Beside the Thames, on the reclaimed site of an old power station in east London, plans are well advanced for the first phase of a small new town that will eventually provide almost 11,000 homes, plus shops, health and leisure centres and up to five new schools. Next year, in the once unglamorous setting of Barking Reach - rebranded Barking Riverside - work will start on the first wave of badly needed affordable housing, with a mix of tenures to address the new reality of a deeply depressed property market.</p> <p>With housebuilding at the lowest level since records began, fuelled by a credit crunch-induced mortgage squeeze alongside rising repossessions and growing waiting lists for social housing, it is difficult to overstate the current crisis. Construction companies are abandoning hundreds of sites nationwide in a desperate attempt to boost balance sheets as profits plunge and land values plummet by more than 50% in some areas.</p> <p>But amid the gloom, innovative solutions to revive the flagging market are emerging. These involve local and national government, and their agencies, buying empty properties and, where necessary, acquiring cut-price land for development - in short, intervening in a way that would have been unthinkable a year ago. </p> <p>Barking Riverside may provide one way forward. While the 150-hectare development was conceived in a booming property market earlier this decade, its outline provides the new Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) in England - which begins work next month - with a public/private partnership model to kickstart building.</p> <p>Key to the Barking development is a joint venture company, embracing the national regeneration agency English Partnerships - which is merging with the Housing Corporation, another quango, to form the HCA - and developer Bellway, Britain's fourth largest house-builder. Four years ago, EP took a 49%, \u00a316m stake in the joint company to drive development forward by reclaiming the toxic \"brownfield\" site. The expectation was that much of its investment would, at the very least, be recouped over the next 20 years.</p> <p>Now the HCA, which will start with an annual budget of more than \u00a35bn - although this could well rise if the government brings forward future spending allocations - could soon be casting its eyes on other sites with planning permission around the country, some of them greenfield, where development has stalled because builders have run out of cash. On some sites, work has stopped midway through construction, while in city centres the locked gates outside seemingly abandoned projects provide a graphic illustration of the credit crunch.</p> <p><strong>Building public investment</strong></p> <p>Robert Napier, the HCA chairman, is in no doubt that his agency has to acquire land when it is relatively cheap. But there is a caveat. \"It must be done in a way that provides a good investment for the public,\" he insists. </p> <p>In the current global financial turmoil, with builders laying off workers in the face of mounting losses, several options are being considered by the HCA: for example, buying suitable sites from developers and then contracting them to complete a project; or forming joint ventures such as Barking, that involve the HCA directly taking a stake - which would vary according to a developer's balance sheet - in sites; or investing directly in housing associations, rather than simply dishing out grants to them. </p> <p>In this way, builders and housing associations will get the necessary cashflow either to start or complete schemes, while allowing the HCA to share in any future profit, which could eventually be ploughed into other projects. At the same time, the agency would be in a position to insist on good design and high carbon-efficiency standards.</p> <p>Here again, Barking Riverside might be a model. Stephen Oakes, English Partnerships' regional director for London and the Thames Gateway corridor, in which Barking is a key project, says the business plan envisages some profit emerging for the public purse after 20 years. And Oakes thinks the project has attractions elsewhere. He says: \"The public sector can step up and say, 'We are willing to take a much longer view on this.' We have to persuade the housebuilders that there is a profit, but not a fast-buck return. We are also in a position to insist on high standards.\"</p> <p>What is clear is that builders are willing to do deals. The House Builders Federation says: \"A lot are looking at selling land because they need to put money back into the business.\" On the back of this, others are keen to take advantage of what appears to some as a fire sale of land. Housing associations, which class themselves as social businesses and are partly funded by the Housing Corporation, are increasingly big players in the market - delivering more homes in London than private builders. While some are feeling the pinch, and might have to be bailed out through mergers, most are having to drastically curb or halt developments because projected income from house sales - on which associations increasingly depend to cross-subsidise social housing - has dried up.</p> <p>But David Montague, chief executive of London and Quadrant, one of the country's largest associations, says many balance sheets are still strong compared with private builders. \"We are in the market for land,\" he says. \"It makes much more sense [for either the HCA, or local councils] to partner associations with a strong track record to break the current three-way stand-off between lenders who won't lend, buyers who won't buy, and builders who won't build.\"</p> <p>Unless quick action is taken - and many are taking comfort from the commitment by the chancellor, Alistair Darling, to boost spending on housing - the next financial year will see housebuilding levels plunge further. Social and affordable housing could be badly hit.</p> <p>David Orr, chief executive of the National Housing Federation, which represents associations, speaks ominously of a worst-case scenario in which there is \"zero growth\" because associations cannot cross-subsidise social housing. But he is cautiously optimistic of a gradual upturn, guided by the HCA. He says: \"They will have a much broader range of interventions than the Housing Corporation [which funds and regulates social and affordable housing], such as equity investments, sharing the risk, and thus allowing developments to go ahead.\"</p> <p><strong>Use of unsold homes</strong></p> <p>Around the country, other measures are under way to boost housing supply. Last week, under a \u00a3200m initiative announced five months ago by Gordon Brown to buy up unsold homes for social housing, one developer received \u00a313m of public money for 335 of its vacant properties across 19 sites in England. These will be managed by a housing association. And in Shropshire, the county council - which will shortly morph into an all-purpose unitary authority, absorbing five districts - has reached agreement to use some of the \u00a360m held in reserve by the districts to buy up unsold homes. But bigger deals might be on the horizon in the county, such as forming joint ventures with developers to buy land for building or finish partly completed projects that have ground to a halt.</p> <p>Nationally, however, much depends on the willingness of the government to pool housing spending - currently spread across a raft of Whitehall programmes - into a common pot so that the new Homes and Communities Agency can begin with a bang, rather than a whimper.</p> <p>\u2022 The housing crisis at <a href=\"http://SocietyGuardian.co.uk/housing \">SocietyGuardian.co.uk/housing </a></p>",
  "<h2>Spooky behaviour</h2> <p>We've always known that government is secretive, but a freedom of information request from the little-known Office of Surveillance Commissioners reveals not just that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has its very own spooks, but that no one knows what they are up to. It seems that in 2006, Defra's spies targeted the Rural Payments Agency, the Egg Marketing Inspectorate, the Fish Health Inspectorate, and the Maritime Fisheries Agency, among others, but the inspectors' report on their work, seen by Eco Soundings, finds that all authorisations for \"directed surveillance\" - that is, secretly following people - were \"flawed\". It says: \"It's very unusual, if not unique, for inspectors to discover that there has been no discernible attempt [by senior staff] to try and establish what it is that enforcement officers do and how they do it.\"</p> <h2>Shipping news</h2> <p>Zut! The giant French aircraft carrier Le Clemenceau may not end its days in Hartlepool. Even as the toxic ship and its carcinogenic cargo of 760 tonnes of asbestos and 330 tonnes of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) was being prepared last week to make its final voyage, the court of appeal reversed a decision by the high court. This means that the doughty Jean Kennedy, of the Friends of Hartlepool group, can make a full legal challenge - with the help of Public Interest Lawyers.</p> <h2>Minister for miracles</h2> <p>All heaven seems to have welcomed uber-townie Jane Kennedy as new minister of farming, waste, horses and a lot more. As soon as she was appointed, the gloomiest September ever gave way to glorious October sunshine, and fresh breezes bathed the land. Last week, Jane could report that Britain has had its best ever wheat harvest, and now comes her news that flytipping on public land across England has decreased by 7.5% in a year. Next week she is expected to abolish flooding.</p> <h2>Foul tackle</h2> <p>The government is widely - and sometimes wrongly - accused of talking up climate change but doing little about it. But now there is clear proof that rhetoric is officially the order of the day. Last week, it responded formally to the Environmental Audit Committee. Page 7, para 10, reads: \"The government is extremely committed to talking [sic] climate change domestically. The UK has made significant progress in reducing its GHG emissions.\"</p> <h2>Thirst for power</h2> <p>Is James Bond getting real? The plot of the new Quantum of Solace film concerns an environmental scientist who works for an evil bunch plotting to take over Latin America's water. Impossible, huh? Oh, no. This is clearly based on the vast Guarani aquifer, which lies beneath the surface of parts of Paraguay, Uruguay, Argentina and Brazil, and is one of the world's largest freshwater reserves. Real suspicions were raised that the US wanted to control the aquifer - which has enough water to supply 500 million people for centuries - when 400 armed American troops set up camp above it in 2005. This prompted Argentina's Nobel peace prize winner, Adolfo P\u00e9rez Esquivel, to suggest they were there for the agua. If you can't face Bond, Eco Soundings recommends the excellent Sed, Invasion Gota a Gota (Thirst, Invasion Drop by Drop) by the Argentine film-maker Mausi Martinez - a real eco drama-doc.</p> <h2>Every little helps</h2> <p>The Federation of Poles, the wonderfully titled UN High Representative for the Alliance of Civilisations, and the Professional Arabs Network have all been granted audiences with ministers at the Department for Communities and Local Government in the last year. So, too, have local councils, housing associations, estate agents, lobbyists, bankers, builders, architects and representatives of other private companies. Of all these, however, one stands out as the special one: Tesco is one of only three organisations granted two meetings - first with Yvette Cooper, and then with Hazel Blears. So what did they discuss? Current proposals to make it easier to build out-of-town stores, perhaps? Who knows? Meanwhile, could Tesco's rivals - only one other of which was granted a meeting, and a short one at that - form an orderly queue, please?</p>",
  "<p>Abbey, the Spanish-owned high-street bank, said yesterday it had taken a 70% increase in deposits as savers looked for a safe haven from the financial turmoil. </p> <p>The bank said profits rose 20% over the past nine months to \u00a3737m as the perceived steadying influence of Banco Santander, which bought the bank for \u00a38bn four years ago, attracted savers and mortgage customers.</p> <p>More than \u00a34bn of deposits poured into the bank compared with \u00a32.5bn last year.</p> <p>The figures follow the sale earlier this week of the train-leasing business Porterbrook for a reported \u00a32bn to a consortium of rival banks. </p> <p>Abbey shrugged off concerns that the sale pointed to a need for extra capital and that its Spanish parent was struggling to cope with the global recession, saying that the deal allowed the bank to focus on its retail operations.</p> <p>Abbey's chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, welcomed the government's \u00a337bn bank bail-out plan but said Abbey \"won't be using it\".</p> <p>He said: \"We had strong deposit inflows demonstrating that Abbey, backed by the strength of Santander, is regarded as a secure and trusted home for UK savings customers.\"</p> <p>Santander, which has climbed rapidly to become one of Europe's biggest banks, recently bought the ailing Alliance &amp; Leicester and the savings business of the nationalised Bradford &amp; Bingley.</p> <p>The deals give it about 1,300 high-street branches and deposits of \u00a3116bn, making it the UK's third-biggest deposit-taker behind Royal Bank of Scotland and the soon-to-merge Lloyds TSB and HBOS.</p> <p>It has picked up a large proportion of borrowers shopping for mortgage deals after their lenders were forced to curtail operations.

A report by the Bank of England estimated that about 1.2m households could fall into negative equity if house prices continue to fall over the next few years.</p> <p>Abbey said its finances were secure, with about 60% of its balance sheet coming from customer deposits, and less than 10% of funding from wholesale markets.</p>",

  "<p><em>For the field is full of shades as I near <br> the shadowy coast,<br>And a ghostly batsman plays to the bowling <br> of a ghost,<br>And I look through my tears on a <br> soundless-clapping host<br>As the run-stealers flicker to and fro,<br> To and fro:<br>O my Hornby and my Barlow long ago!</em><br>- At Lord's, by Francis Thompson</p> <p>Francis Thompson's famous poem encapsulates the feeling of a certain type of cricket lover - wistful, nostalgic, yearning for a golden age. Think of John Major, with his warm beer, bicycling spinsters and village greens resounding to the thwack of willow on leather. But traditionalists - I count myself among this dewy-eyed throng - now face a challenge: to carry on feeling for a game that is undergoing its greatest revolution for more than a century. The epicentre of the earthquake is India, with its big-money Indian Premier League (IPL), where players can earn more in a month than their predecessors earned in their entire careers. But the starkest manifestation of the new mentality comes this Saturday, when England play the \"Stanford Superstars\" in a winner-takes-all Twenty20 (20 overs a side) match in Antigua worth $1m to each player on the winning side.</p> <p>The match is a disgrace at almost every level, and not just because its Texas billionaire backer, Sir Allen Stanford, has spent the past week on a dollar-driven ego trip, parading around his private ground, hogging the limelight and cavorting with the England players' wives. The key charge against the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), which sanctioned the game, is that it is has sold its soul for the Stanford millions (the ECB gets $3.5m regardless of the result). </p> <p>\"The match has no cricketing value whatsoever,\" said Steve James, a former England player, when the squad was announced last month. \"Indeed to call it cricket at all will be difficult. For November 1 will be the night cricket is turned into reality TV, where some grisly voyeuristic fare is served up for those of a short attention span. Big Brother has finished: roll up instead to watch the nervous antics of the England cricket team. Who will drop a catch to cost his mates half a million quid?\"</p> <p>The traditionalists' view is expressed even more eloquently by Matthew Engel, the former editor of Wisden, though the eloquence comes from his silence - and absence. Engel is currently in the US covering the presidential election. I emailed him to ask what he thought of the Stanford match. \"I'd love to help,\" he emailed back, \"but I'm really really out of it, partly because I've been doing other things, partly because I'm so appalled by what is happening to cricket.\"</p> <p>It is an extreme view, but we spurned lovers of the game can become overwrought, embittered. Returning to the poem, the point about Hornby and Barlow is that they were not great or especially famous players - just the players that Thompson grew up with watching Lancashire. The field is full of shades - not just for Thompson but for all cricketing traditionalists. \"I saw Hutton in his prime /Another time, another time,\" hymns the arch-memorialist Harold Pinter. Now Pinter on Stanford - that would be a poem worth reading!</p> <p>Michael Atherton, the former England captain, once said that sportsmen should play for love of the game, and one would like to think that in the long term a successful career can only be sustained by such a feeling. But here is a match that exists purely and simply for money. Alastair Cook, the young England opener who is tipped as a future England captain, even admitted it. \"The actual cricket is quite unimportant, apart from financially,\" he said last month. </p> <p>The press conference in June that launched the match - and the series of which it is the culmination - was in execrable taste. Stanford arrived at Lord's by helicopter, touching down on the hallowed turf of the Nursery Ground, and had brought the all-important dosh with him, showing off a plastic crate full of $50 notes said to amount to $20m - the prize fund for the match. It was an appalling spectacle. \"Twenty20 is the future. That's where you're going to make your money,\" declared the man who thinks Test matches - the long-drawn-out, sometimes soporific five-day games that pit country against country - are boring. </p> <p>From the beginning, the ECB have been on the defensive over its link-up with Stanford. But chief executive David Collier argues that it had to take up the sponsorship. \"We would have been massively criticised if we'd not taken advantage of the opportunity,\" he tells me. \"If we don't embrace change, entrepreneurs will step in, and control of the game will slip away from governing bodies which care about Test cricket. There is always potential for unauthorised events, and that can pose a significant threat.\"</p> <p>The shadow of Kerry Packer, who bought up the 50 best players in the world for his own televised tournament in 1977, hangs over much of this thinking. Administrators feel they have to ride the wave, or it will overwhelm them. Collier believes that both Test cricket and Twenty20 can thrive as long as \"balance\" - the watchword of every current administrator - is maintained. \"The attraction of the Stanford series,\" he says, \"is that it's short and doesn't impact on the rest of the schedule. It will also benefit the grass roots of the game [through the $3.5m the ECB receives] and pay for development work in the Caribbean.\" </p> <p>The Stanford series may be an unedifying spectacle, but it is a symptom of what is happening to cricket, not the central problem. Cricket worldwide has gone Twenty20 crazy. Twenty20 began, as a professional attraction as opposed to a pub knockabout, in England in 2003. It was cricket-lite for a generation that didn't want to sit through a five-day Test match, or a four-day county game, or even the 50-over-a-side form of the game that had been seen as the salvation of the sport 30 years ago. Now, as it roars through India and beyond, it threatens to take over the world.</p> <p>When I pitched up at the Metropolitan police ground in East Molesey in July 2003 to see Surrey play Sussex in one of these new-fangled Twenty20 games, I didn't realise I was witnessing a watershed for cricket. Twenty20 was a clever wheeze developed by Stuart Robertson, the then marketing manager of the England and Wales Cricket Board. It was designed as a brief mid-season break from the rigours of the \"proper\" game - two weeks of high-summer fun and frivolity, with evening matches, lots of families, burger vans, bouncy castles and the occasional post-match gig. Atomic Kitten seemed to pop up a great deal. My hazy memories - the beer and the still-hot evening sun of a wonderful summer - are happy ones. But back then we didn't realise we were nurturing a monster.</p> <p>Five years on, this two-week antidote to the slog of long-form cricket has turned into a juggernaut that threatens to steamroller the global game. The heart of the danger lies in India, where the success of the glitzy, money-soaked IPL launched last April has transformed the power balance between Twenty20 and Test cricket. The IPL will henceforth be an annual competition lasting almost two months in which the world's best players can earn \u00a3700,000 - at least double what they would be paid on an annual contract with their countries. </p> <p>The Stanford series exists primarily because the England players were not allowed to take part in the inaugural IPL competition. While every other leading cricketer joined the IPL party, the England players were engaged in a low-key Test series against New Zealand, whose best players - rubbing salt into the England stars' financial wounds - arrived late to play the Tests carrying their money-filled suitcases from India. </p> <p>The success of the IPL has led other countries to contemplate their own Twenty20 competitions. The ECB and the counties are currently haggling over what form an English Premier League should take. There is also talk of a southern hemisphere Twenty20 league spanning Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. The result is likely to be less and less time for Test cricket. \"The IPL want a window for their matches,\" says one leading administrator, \"but give them a window and everyone else will want one too. It'll be all windows and no glass.\" </p> <p>There is, though, another view to that of the nostalgists. Ed Smith, the captain of Middlesex, reckons it's too early to judge which way cricket will go. \"There's a danger of writing things off just because they're new,\" he says. \"Probably when the first Ashes series took place [in 1877], there were people moaning that it detracted from traditional county matches.\"</p> <p>There is some truth in his criticism - the average anoraked county cricket lover would make Edmund Burke look like a crazed radical. It is no coincidence that arch-Tory journalist Simon Heffer adores county cricket, and has rejected every alteration to the playing conditions since about 1952 - \"O my Boycott and my Edrich long ago!\". And it has to be said that WG Grace, progenitor of the modern game and shameless \"shamateur\", would have been the first one on the plane to India. </p> <p>But even Smith admits there are worries. \"There are lots of grounds for concern. We have to preserve what makes cricket unique and special - and that's the five-day game. Even though I love all forms of the sport, when I am asked to make a case for cricket I always turn to Test cricket. The narrative is so complicated and subtle and varying that no sport can match it.\"</p> <p>Test cricket is War and Peace; Twenty20 is a Jeffrey Archer short story. Test cricket, in its many-sidedness, reflects the age of George Eliot and Henry James; Twenty20, in its brashness and cupidity, reflects the age of Jonathan Ross. Administrators want both - long-form for its history, short-form for its hysteria - but, as ever, facing both ways is dangerous.</p> <p>Stuart Robertson, the man at the ECB who started the ball rolling back in 2003 and who is now commercial director of Hampshire cricket club, says that ultimately the market will decide which form of the game takes precedence. \"I love two-innings cricket [first-class matches played over four or five days],\" he says, \"and we saw Twenty20 as a means to an end - a way of bringing in new audiences. But it is not for administrators to determine the future of the game. That will be shaped by customers voting with their wallets and their feet. Tradition and heritage is one of cricket's strong points, but that mustn't mean cricket dies the death of a hundred cuts. Back in 2003, we'd seen a 17% decline in county attendances over the previous five years and we had to do something.\"</p> <p>What Robertson and his colleagues did was supposed to galvanise the county game, which - with a bit of help from Atomic Kitten - it did. But the law of unintended consequences has now kicked in ferociously, and the structure of the global game is under threat. The organisation which is supposed to keep the show on the road is the International Cricket Council, and its job over the next decade will be extraordinarily difficult, with rich businessmen such as Stanford offering players instant fortunes and national boards keen to organise lucrative tournaments that cut across ICC-backed events such as the World Cup and Champions' Trophy. </p> <p>Rather brilliantly, the ICC's spokesman Brian Murgatroyd turns this potential nightmare on its head and sees it as a sign of cricket's success. \"It's an indication that people want to be involved with cricket, and that has to be a good thing,\" he says. And those tacky Stanford millions? \"If players reach the top of their profession, there's an argument that they should be paid appropriately. If you were offered $250,000 for this article rather than the \u00a3200 the Guardian will pay you, you'd find it hard to say no.\"</p> <p>Murgatroyd says the ICC wants to preserve all three forms of the game - long-form, one-day and Twenty20. Indeed, he says, that will give the sport a unique advantage in the Darwinian struggle for fans and broadcasting money. \"It offers something for every taste,\" he argues, \"from the traditional fan who loves the cut and thrust of Test cricket, to the 50-over game, which has a history stretching back to the World Cup in 1975 and will also be appreciated by the purist, to Twenty20, the new kid on the block.\" Odd to hear one-day cricket proclaimed as a game for the purist - \"O my Capel and my Pringle long ago\" - but he makes this three-pronged attack sound an attractive proposition.</p> <p>Whether it is achievable is another matter. Murgatroyd suggests that after 2012, when the current cycle of Test tours come to an end, there may be scope for a new Test match structure, with national teams playing each other as part of a Test league system. My guess is that windows will be opened up to permit at least three glitzy, six-week Twenty20 competitions modelled on the IPL, and that all the less saleable Test series will be downsized and shoehorned into that league structure. Tours and major series, except for \"iconic\" ones such as the Ashes and Australia v India, will be consigned to history, and Test teams will instead jet in and out to play their league Test match. </p> <p>Does any of this matter? Who cares if it's played over three hours or, as in the case of the so-called Timeless Test between South Africa and England in Durban in 1939, 10 days (even then they didn't finish because England, close to making an astonishing 696 to win, had a boat to catch). I would say yes. First, because I value \"real\" cricket - the engrossing battle between bat and ball fought out over a sufficiently long period for true strength to emerge. Second, because context and tradition are everything - teams should represent a country, county or region, rather than a brand. But, most of all, because if money and the whim of the rich rule a sport, it consumes itself.</p> <p>The Stanford match marks another grisly stage in cricket's loss of innocence - or at least relative innocence, compared with the ugly, ill-tempered, money-obsessed, corporatist world of football. Perhaps Engel is right and the soul of the game has already been lost. After more than 40 years of loving the game, and always finding in its verities and absurdities solace in dismal times, it may be time for me to give up too. Certainly on November 1, I will be averting my eyes. But I hope something of its character and variety can be saved. The winners in Saturday's edition of Strictly Come Cricketing may make a cool million, but they could lose everything, including the essence of this odd and wonderful game.

  "<p>\"Authorities are looking for someone who can work confidently with chief officers, who's seen things before, who's not frightened by difficult things, and who accepts that when the job is done, they'll move on.\"</p> <p>That is how one experienced interim manager sees his role when he works with councils. \"The price is an issue, but if you can't prove that you are good value, they should get rid of you on the spot.\"</p> <p>Councils have taken a little longer than central government, perhaps, to understand the value of the troubleshooting interim manager, but are now catching up fast. This particular manager, for instance, was used by one county council to sort out a highly sensitive commercial situation with a private supplier, and local authorities are now using interims for more than just maternity leave cover, according to Louise Goodwin, director of corporate services at Chelmsford borough council. \"We are using interims quite imaginatively, not just to fill gaps,\" she says.</p> <p>Recently, one interim manager was brought in for eight months to help sort out what Goodwin describes as a \"failing\" IT service. \"We recognised the skills to transform something are not the same as the skills to maintain it,\" she says. Interim managers are not cheap, but Goodwin says they are worth the premium price. \"You get someone who's used to working at a higher level. In our case, our interim manager identified a number of significant savings, which more than offset the cost of using her.\"</p> <p>James Fallon, director of recruitment agency Interim Performers, says local government understands interim management better, but believes there is one big reason why there are still fewer of them in local authorities: \"The huge project workload in central government dwarfs everything.\"</p> <p>Nonetheless, there are still good opportunities for interim managers in local government, which itself has a large and varied set of projects. These include major government programmes, such as Building Schools for the Future and the adult social services programme, Putting People First, and there is also big demand in areas that need managers with specialist expertise, ranging from children's services to the environment and highways.</p> <p> Local authorities are particularly interested in interim managers with skills in commissioning and procurement, says Fallon. \"A lot of authorities are looking at the way they commission services, particularly in health and education.\"</p> <p>However, opportunities in local government tend to be unevenly spread. A survey earlier this year by interim recruitment agency Chiumento reported that 66% of interim management assignments are in London and the south-east.</p> <p>Helen Wilson, a business manager at public sector recruitment agency Veredus, based in Leeds, estimates that demand in the south-east is probably three times that seen further north, partly because of the concentration of skills in and around London. \"In London, interim managers are more likely to live at home and travel to work daily, which brings the cost down,\" she says. \"There are fewer people in the north, so the likelihood of finding someone who can live at home is remote.\"</p> <p><strong>Northern exposure?</strong></p> <p>Charlotte Baker, head of public sector interim management at agency OdgersInterim, says it can still be hard to persuade northern councils to pay the rates expected by interim managers. That can be up to \u00a31,000 a day, but that is good value compared to a consultancy rate of up to \u00a32,000 a day, she says.</p> <p>At Veredus, Wilson thinks attitudes are changing: \"Once people have used an interim, it does open their eyes to a different way of working. I work with authorities who now use interims as part of their workforce planning.\"</p> <p>Perhaps surprisingly, political changes, such as the creation of new unitary councils in some areas, do not always result in demand for interim managers. \"There haven't been as many interesting pieces of work as we would have hoped,\" acknow-ledges Wilson, although he believes there may be more opportunities when unitaries go live next April.</p> <p>And what about the stereotypical retired town hall employee, looking for a pleasant post-retirement post - the \"old buzzards, just buzzing around\" as one recruitment agent puts it?</p> <p>Such managers do exist, but there are now more highly qualified managers who have chosen interim management as a career choice and there are more younger people choosing this role. But councils also need to look beyond the stereotype - interim managers should not be ruled out, just because they are older, Baker rightly points out. </p> <p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p> <p>Interim Performers interim provider: <a href=\"http://www.interimperformers.com\">interimperformers.com</a></p> <p>Veredus interim provider: <a href=\"http://veredus.co.uk/services/interim_management\">veredus.co.uk/services/interim_management</a></p> <p><strong>Interim dos and don'ts</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Do ensure you have a very specific brief from the organisation, with clear objectives.

  "<h2><strong>The report talks about the planet's limited capacity, but doesn't technology change those limits?</strong></h2> <p>This point is made by Martin Livermore of the Scientific Alliance: a century ago, people might have feared there were insufficient horses, and then the internal combustion engine was invented. James Leape of WWF International says technological improvements would slow the rate of over-use of natural resources, but are not yet being implemented fast enough: \"There are technological opportunities to change the shape of that curve, and much of this report is about that, but at the moment the trajectory is for two planets.\" Livermore's example raises another issue: solutions such as the combustion engine can in turn create fresh problems, greenhouse gas and climate change.</p> <h2><strong>Are these solutions enough to stave off a looming 'ecological credit crunch'?</strong></h2> <p>\"The good news is ... it is not too late to prevent an irreversible ecological recession setting in,\" the report says. It adopts the \"wedges\" approach, to break problems into manageable segments. On the demand side these focus on reducing consumption: for example, less travel, and women's education and voluntary family planning to restrain population growth. On the production side, the key areas are energy efficiency, renewable energies of all kinds, and carbon capture and storage.</p> <h2><strong>How much would all this cost, and who would pay?</strong></h2> <p>The report's authors repeat the estimate of Lord Stern, an adviser to the Treasury on the economics of climate change, that the cost would be about 2% of the value of the economy - trillions of pounds - or one year's economic growth, depending on your perspective. They suggest various sources: ending subsidies which promote damaging behaviour like over-fishing or over-farming soil, carbon-pricing or taxes, and reallocating government spending. At a deeper level, this requires a new type of economics, one that puts a value on natural ecosystem services like flood protection or clean air and water. </p> <h2><strong>How can this be made to happen?</strong></h2> <p>In the end, change will boil down to political will. Chief Emeka Anyaoku, international president of WWF, was gloomy on the prospects, saying: \"Where is the collective action, the bold leadership, and the vision required to conserve the biodiversity of the planet? ... I see very little of such passion.\" Optimists hope the financial crisis provides an opportunity for a \"green New Deal\" under which political leaders will spend their way out of a recession - but this time round spend money on natural infrastructure such as forest protection, and green economic sectors such as reuse of resources and clean energy.</p>",
  "<p>The gloom hanging over the car industry deepened yesterday when Honda announced a further cut in production at its Swindon plant.</p> <p>It said it would curb output by an additional 10,000 vehicles between January and March next year. In September Honda said it was reducing production at Swindon, where it makes the CRV and three and five-door Civics, by 22,000 units.</p> <p>Yesterday Honda said it had been forced into the extra curbs because \"the global financial situation has continued to affect consumer confidence\".</p> <p>The latest cuts came as Honda's Japanese parent company warned that the global downturn meant annual profits would be lower than expected.</p> <p>The cuts will reduce production at Swindon this fiscal year to 196,000 cars. Honda said it was not seeking job losses among its 4,800 workforce and that plans to start production of the Jazz model next year were not affected. Roger Maddison, national officer of Unite, said: \"Honda is suffering the same as everybody else in the car business but they are not making layoffs, which is to be commended. Instead, they are holding on to skills and people for the time when the market turns up. We urge others in the sector to take a similar long-term view.\"</p> <p>One brighter note came from Ford in the UK, which said it would invest \u00a370m at its Bridgend engine plant to produce next-generation low-emission 1.6-litre, four-cylinder petrol engine.

  "<p>Britain's retailers are gearing themselves up for one of the most difficult Christmas trading periods of recent years after the latest snapshot of the high street from the CBI yesterday found that fear of unemployment was curbing spending.</p> <p>The monthly distributive trades survey from the employers' organisation found that half the shops and stores polled reported lower sales this month than in October 2007, with only 23% showing an increase. The balance of -27 points was the same as in September, although slightly better than the City had feared in the light of the recent spate of bad news from the financial sector.</p> <p>\"Shoppers face competing pressures on their wallets and are spooked by worries over job losses and the slowing economy,\" said Andy Clarke, chairman of the CBI distributive trades panel and retail director of Asda. \"Retailers have had another tough month and, while there are some winners, the majority are suffering. The sector looks set to endure a very challenging run-up to Christmas. We are hoping the recent drop in interest rates will cut consumers and business some slack as it feeds through to the wider economy.\"</p> <p>Retailers have seen business conditions worsen markedly since the turn of the year, when there were more firms reporting annual growth in sales volumes than declines. The squeeze on real incomes from rising inflation coupled with the impact of dearer energy bills and falling house prices has led to consumers tightening their belts, with the CBI finding that retailers' problems are being passed on to the firms that supply them.</p> <p>Only 17% of retailers said orders were up on a year earlier against 52% that said they were down. Stores reported that they had ample stocks to meet what was expected to be weak levels of demand over the next few months - a key period for the sector. </p> <p>With the property market in steep decline, shops selling household goods faced the toughest trading conditions, the survey said. There were also big falls for stores selling furniture and carpets, clothing and books, whereas supermarkets were one of the few sectors to report year-on-year growth.</p> <p>Motor traders, the CBI said, were having an even tougher time than high-street retailers. None of the dealers questioned said business was up on October 2007, while 87% reported a fall.</p> <p>Howard Archer, UK economist at Global Insight, said: \"While not as bad as feared, the CBI's October distributive trades survey was still undeniably very weak. October's balance was a massive 45 points below the long-term average of +18%. </p> <p>\"Most sectors reported sharp year-on-year declines in sales in October, although there were rises for a few sectors. Meanwhile, retailers remain pessimistic about near-term sales prospects as the critical Christmas season looms, with a balance of -25% expecting a year-on-year rise in sales volumes in November.</p> <p>\"The CBI survey does little to alleviate fears that the economy is set for further marked contraction in the fourth quarter after GDP shrank by 0.5% quarter on quarter in the third quarter. With consumers being hit very hard by a punitive combination of factors which have been magnified by the financial crisis, the prospects for spending look bleak.\"</p>",
  "<p>If <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc\">BBC</a> executives were hoping the furious reaction to a series of sexually explicit on air prank calls by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/russell-brand\">Russell Brand</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/jonathan-ross\">Jonathan Ross</a> would start to blow itself out, they were sorely mistaken. </p> <p>Last night, BBC director of audio and music Tim Davie was sent on a tour of newsrooms in sackcloth and ashes to try to regain the initiative after a day in which outrage over the behaviour of two of its stars threatened to tip into the wider debate about the BBC's future. </p> <p>Yesterday morning brought news that the media regulator was launching its own investigation into whether Brand and Ross had broken its rules on harm and offence when they called 78-year-old actor Andrew Sachs' answermachine to say that Brand had \"fucked your granddaughter\". </p> <p>By mid-afternoon, questions had been asked in the House of Commons and the leader of the opposition had added his voice to calls for an inquiry. By early evening, complaints to the BBC had topped 10,000, the corporation was leading its own Six O'Clock News with the row and the prime minister <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordonbrown\">Gordon Brown</a> had diverted his mind from the global financial crisis to condemn the pair's \"inappropriate and unacceptable behaviour\". </p> <p>Twenty-four hour news channels desperate to move the story on, newspapers aware of the selling power of celebrity, websites such as YouTube that allow those who missed the offending broadcast to catch up, and an outpouring of fury in the blogosphere have combined to leave the corporation on the back foot. </p> <p><strong>Complaint</strong> </p> <p>In a 10-minute sequence on the original broadcast, Brand and Ross went on to joke that Sachs might kill himself and composed a song that included the line: \"I said some things I didn't of oughta, like I had sex with your granddaughter.\" If Ofcom receives a personal complaint from Sachs, who played Manuel in Fawlty Towers, it could also investigate whether the BBC broke rules on fairness and privacy. </p> <p>Ross has apologised privately to Sachs and his family. Leaving his house yesterday, Brand answered questions from reporters by spreading his hands and repeating \"Hare Krishna\". </p> <p>Brown, in Paris to meet French president Nicolas Sarkozy, said: \"This is clearly inappropriate and unacceptable behaviour, as is now widely recognised. Ofcom have said they will investigate the matter and it is for the BBC, the BBC Trust and Ofcom to take any appropriate action.\"</p> <p>The Conservative leader David Cameron said the BBC had \"some very straightforward questions to answer\", adding: \"The BBC needs to be transparent about how it takes decisions and explain its decision-taking process.\"</p> <p>The Tory MP Nadine Dorries called for the BBC to terminate its contracts with the stars: \"This money could be better spent in the hands of hardworking families.\" In the Commons, justice minister David Hanson said he did not think the comments were \"appropriate\" or \"in keeping with broadcasting\". </p> <p>John Whittingdale, the chairman of the culture, media and sport select committee, said he would question BBC director-general Mark Thompson on the issue this month. \"The most serious question is not the fact they did it, but in the way the BBC dealt with it. A senior editorial figure approved it, which was a serious error of judgment,\" he said. </p> <p><strong>Responsible</strong></p> <p>The row has come at a bad time for the BBC, as the long-running policy debate about the future of public service broadcasting inches towards a conclusion. In a speech today laying out Tory policy, shadow culture secretary Jeremy Hunt will call for more \"socially responsible broadcasting\". He will tell broadcasters that raising an issue in a documentary or current affairs show should not be a \"fig leaf\" for a lack of social responsibility in their other output. </p> <p>Davie has launched an internal review to find out whether the programme followed compliance procedures. The prerecorded show was approved by a \"senior editorial figure\", despite a plea from Sachs not to air it.</p> <p>Davie last night repeated the BBC's apology and said the programme was \"unacceptable\". </p> <p>He will deliver his report to the BBC Trust on November 20 after talking to those involved, including the two presenters, Brand's 25-year-old producer Nic Philps, and Lesley Douglas, the Radio 2 controller responsible for introducing both Brand and Ross to the station. If the matter was properly referred up along the BBC chain of command, it would have been Douglas who had the final say.</p> <p>Last night it emerged that Georgina Baillie, Sachs' 23-year-old granddaughter, will present her side of the story after approaching publicist Max Clifford. \"She's upset because her granddad is genuinely upset and really hurt by it,\" Clifford said.</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p><strong>Jonathan Ross</strong> is at the centre of a furore that has been a gift to the <strong>BBC's</strong> critics and could end up framing the debate about its future. In 2006 his reported \u00a318m, three-year pay deal was used by the BBC's rivals as shorthand for its supposed profligacy. Combining as it does several lines of attack - that the corporation is arrogant, pays its stars too much of our money and has lost touch with its core values - the latest row has been seized on. </p> <p>Unfortunately for the BBC's director general, <strong>Mark Thompson,</strong> the furore has coincided with the endgame in a debate about the future of public service broadcasting post-2012. <strong>Ofcom </strong>will deliver its conclusions in January. </p> <p>Critics said the BBC's slow response and the confusing reviews now in motion showed the weakness of its regulatory system, which was overhauled after the <strong>Hutton</strong> inquiry, and its compliance regime, supposed to have been tightened after last year's fakery rows and phone-in scandals.</p> <p>But the chair of the media select committee, <strong>John Whittingdale</strong>, said the BBC would be wrong to underestimate the public anger. \"The level of public outrage is genuine.\"</p>",
  "<p>The energy group BG has launched a \u00a32.2bn agreed bid for the Queensland Gas Company as part of its strategy to boost its position in the market for liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the Asia-Pacific region.</p> <p>Earlier this year, BG's ambitions in the region suffered a setback when its hostile offer for another Australian gas producer, Origin Energy, was rebuffed.</p> <p>But yesterday it looked poised to succeed in capturing QGC. BG already owns a near 10% stake in the Australian company and said that it had acceptances or declarations of intent that would give it 57% of its bid target.</p> <p>BG's chief executive, Frank Chapman, said the A$5.75 (\u00a32.25) a share cash offer was a good deal for both companies \"with BG gaining the opportunity to invest in the long-term growth of upstream production and QGC shareholders gaining a certain and fair cash premium\".</p> <p>In a research note, Morgan Stanley analysts said the price BG was paying to increase its own supplies was \"substantially lower\" than other recent deals in the sector and said it \"addresses the long-held view that BG was short equity gas in Asia as it grows its integrated LNG business\". </p> <p>Ivor Ries at EL &amp; C Baillieu Stockbroking said the deal was a fair price for QGC. \"It is definitely hard to see anyone coming over the top for QGC.\"</p> <p>BG said the acquisition of QGC, for which it is paying an 80% premium to the last traded price, would be a step change in the scale of its Asia-Pacific operations. Although energy prices have been volatile recently on fears that the global credit crunch will hit demand, analysts believe that in the longer term, demand for LNG in the Asia-Pacific region will grow by 20% to 126m tonnes a year by 2010 and to just above 200m tonnes by 2020.</p> <p>Chapman said: \"The LNG business is a long-term business. In the long term, LNG demand is going to grow powerfully.\"</p> <p>The company already supplies customers in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, India and China. It is planning to add Hong Kong, Chile and Singapore in the coming years. BG already has a partnership with QGC to build an LNG plant in Queensland that would use the Australian company's reserves of coal-seam gas - a natural gas produced when organic matter is turned into coal. CSG can be turned into LNG and then shipped to market.</p> <p>A number of other leading energy companies including Royal Dutch Shell, Petronas and ConocoPhillips have bought into LNG projects in Australia.</p> <p>BG said its offer was final, unless a higher rival offer emerged, and would be financed from its cash reserves and existing borrowing facilities if required.</p> <p>BG shares rose 46.5p, or 7%, to 710.5p in a buoyant energy sector.</p>",
  "<p>He was born in Jamaica, grew up in a deprived inner-city neighbourhood of Birmingham, and has first-hand experience of racial hatred and rejection. He left school without qualifications, was booted out of the army for being too lippy, and latterly has found out just how hard it is to make a living as a farmer in modern-day Britain. </p> <p>It is not surprising, then, that Wilfred Emmanuel-Jones comes chock-full of opinions. He fumes about social exclusion; he is angry at how black people have been let down by the middle classes; he is hugely critical of corporate Britain, particularly the ever-more powerful supermarkets; and he has little time for the world of finance and banking. </p> <p>What may be more surprising and interesting is that Emmanuel-Jones is thriving in the Conservative party. He has been invited for tea with David Cameron - despite labelling him a \"toff\" - and was given a prominent place for the leader's speech at the Tory conference. Most surprising of all, he has become a darling of the Wiltshire blue-rinse set and is to fight the newly minted seat of Chippenham for the Conservatives at the next general election. </p> <p>He sees himself as a rebel. \"Part of why I've become political is not to accept rules, not to accept what cards life may have dealt you, to challenge the perceived wisdom,\" he says. If people don't like me, that ain't my problem. I don't care if people accept me or not.\" </p> <p>Emmanuel-Jones was born in rural Jamaica, and soon after that his father, a pastor, came to the UK and started work in a factory - a job he died hating. Emmanuel-Jones followed to the UK when he was four, and the family - he was one of nine - were crammed together in a two-up-two-down in Small Heath, Birmingham. He became a disruptive child and young man, failed the 11-plus and had a miserable time at a secondary modern school. His father's allotment became a retreat for Emmanuel-Jones. \"It was a bit of an oasis away from the misery of my surroundings,\" he says. \"I can remember making a promise to myself around the age of 11 that one day I'd own my own farm. That dream carried me through my life.\"</p> <p><strong>Mouthy and difficult</strong></p> <p>After leaving school, Emmanuel-Jones joined the army. \"You were seriously asking for trouble if you were mouthy and difficult,\" he recalls. \"If you were black and mouthy and difficult, you were going to get your head kicked in. I got my head kicked in.\" </p> <p>When he was thrown out of the army, he began flipping burgers, and found he had a talent for the restaurant business. He then decided to get into television. Ignoring the laughter of his friends and family, he began cajoling, hassling and courting media types in Birmingham. </p> <p>He was given a break - he has presence and the gift of the gab - and within a few years found himself working on the BBC's Food and Drink programme. Determined to make big money, Emmanuel-Jones set up a food marketing company. It thrived, and he bought his farm in Devon. He now sells his own sausages and other products, under his deliberately provocative Black Farmer label. </p> <p>The countryside, he found, was not idyllic. It was a place, he says, of wealth, but also of poverty. It had been harmed by the power of the supermarkets and a lack of investment in infrastructure, and was a place outsiders do not understand.</p> <p>Sitting in his flat in the centre of Chippenham, Emmanuel-Jones says people have a \"romantic\" view of the countryside. But he gestures out of the window. \"I have down-and-outs that sleep over there. There are people here who are in society's dustbin. You have a lack of infrastructure here, a town with its soul ripped out. It's the inner cities that get all the attention - the small towns get neglected.\" </p> <p><strong>Stranglehold</strong></p> <p>Supermarkets are one of the problems. \"The supermarkets own this big thing - convenience. Their model is simple. They work on a high-volume, low-margin proposition. To do that, you limit choice. Even though we've got hundreds of varieties of apples in this country, you can only buy five in the supermarket. They have a stranglehold over the food chain. If you're a farmer, you've got nowhere else to sell your products. You either do as they say or you're bust, which I think is unfair. I can't bear that sort of monopoly. They have got this stranglehold.\"</p> <p>Emmanuel-Jones wants supermarkets to charge for parking and be forced to plough this money back into town centres. He says they should get permission for out-of-town stores only if they cough up for a regular bus service. Once a month, they should hold a farmers' market on that paid-for car park, and he advocates supermarkets being made to source a third of their stock from local or regional suppliers. </p> <p>\"I don't want to see the demise of supermarkets,\" he says, \"but what I want to see is sustained responsibility. The easiest thing when you've got a shitload of cash is to chuck a couple of crumbs over and make the community feel you are giving them something.\"</p> <p>He says he admires the approach of the Cadbury family, who made handsome profits from their chocolate empire in Birmingham, but were also social pioneers. \"You can be successful and you can have community responsibility,\" he argues. And he is very critical of the \"massive greed\" of the bankers who have been \"stuffing their pockets\". Sure, he admires the Thatcherite principle that \"whoever you are, wherever you are from, you can achieve what you want\". He would not be where he is now if he had not aspired. But he insists: \"I'm not into the old 'me' culture.\"</p> <p>Emmanuel-Jones says Cameron's idea of a \"broken society\" holds just as true for Wiltshire and Devon as for inner-city Birmingham. He complains about housing shortages and is critical of planning laws that make it difficult for new homes to be built in the countryside. And he campaigns against post office closures. </p> <p>\"Since I was selected in this constituency, we've had three factories closed down,\" he says. \"I believe there should be massive incentives to attract businesses into rural towns. The lifeblood of any rural town is its young. Young people are only going to go there if they can see a future. There need to be some big incentives to attract people from outside the rural community in. New blood is needed.\"</p> <p>Most agricultural colleges, he points out, attract students from the countryside. \"I would like them to be set targets to get kids from the cities to come to those colleges. I believe that will bring some new ideas, but also it's going to do a lot in bringing rural and urban Britain together.\"</p> <p><strong>Scholarship scheme</strong></p> <p>On a small scale, Emmanuel-Jones has done his bit to give young black men from the city a taste of country living through his Black Farmer's scholarship scheme, whereby a group of young men get to live and work on the farm.</p> <p>The project also gives the youths time to think. \"There's a lot of 'white noise' around city living,\" he says. \"One thing about being in a rural environment is that you get a chance to look at yourself.\"</p> <p>And so to the question of what it is to be black and Conservative. \"There's still an opinion out there that if you're a black Tory you have to be mad, sad or bad,\" he says. \"They can't compute it - if you're black, you need to be on the left.\"</p> <p>He feels badly let down by the left. \"The white middle classes thought they always had this need to feel guilty and feel sympathetic towards the struggles of black people, and therefore they listened to what the black voices from the left were saying. And while all this is going on, we, the ordinary people, were still in society's shit heap. None of you people [the left] have ever helped me.</p> <p>\"When we look at why some black kids are failing, I really blame the left. It's created a culture of victimhood and a culture of feeling owed because of how we were treated in the past, which means you don't have to look within. We haven't had to look within as individuals, and as a community.</p> <p>\"I try to remind people from my community that we are offspring of very entrepreneurial people. It took a massive amount of entrepreneurial bite to leave your country of origin to go and live in a foreign country. We all have that within us. That's been forgotten, and the country needs reminding.\"</p> <p>Emmanuel-Jones joined the Tories four years ago after a trip to the party conference. \"Growing up in an area like Small Heath, in the era of Enoch Powell, as a black person you think politics is not for you. But I started to get into thinking: 'Who are these people who are governing us. What's their experience?' And I thought there was something I could add to the mix.\"</p> <p>He believes that rural campaigners have not always helped themselves. He says he has nothing against hunting - \"I don't object to it, but I'm not really into freezing my arse off walking along a field\" - but he believes the campaign against the hunting ban has distracted attention from other issues. \"Most people think [hunting] is quite barbaric, and don't have any sympathy with it. I think we lost a lot of the urbanite sympathy.\" </p> <p>He is optimistic, however, that the broken society he has found in the countryside can heal with just a little outside help. \"Whenever I have one of my cows stuck in a ditch, there's no 999 to call. You've got to rely on your neighbours. If you have a problem and go and ask someone, they will do what they can to help you. It's part of our nature to help and look after people. Rural Britain teaches you that you have to rely on each other. In terms of a broken society, where we are broken is lack of support.\"</p>",
  "<p>Repossessions up 71%. Activity in the high street down for the seventh month in a row. Short-term working at Honda's Swindon plant. An estimate by the Bank of England that losses from the financial turmoil now stand at $2.8 trillion. Just another normal day in the economy.</p> <p>For most people, $2.8 trillion is a meaningless number, as is the news of BP's \u00a310bn profit. What they want to know is how bad is it going to get, who is to blame and whether life will be any better when the economy emerges, as it eventually will, from its problems.</p> <p>The answer to the first question is simple: for the UK this is going to be a painful reality check after all the years of living on tick. As things stand, the economy could contract for at least four of five quarters, leading to rapidly rising unemployment. Falling house prices will expose more and more families who bought homes from 2005 to 2007 to the perils of negative equity. After 15 years of growth, prolonged austerity will come as an almighty shock.</p> <p>Gordon Brown has no doubt who is to blame for all this: the irresponsible bankers who invested unwisely in all those US sub-prime mortgages during the boom years. Britain, he insists, is being sucked down by global forces beyond the control of a government doing its level best to help. Not all of this is piffle - although much of it is.</p> <p>Clearly, Britain is not alone in going through tough times: the fact that there are daily bulletins on the economic health of Iceland, Hungary, Ukraine, Argentina and Turkey, in addition to the usual diet of gloomy news from the G7, is evidence that this is a global downturn of some severity. Yet, as Warren Buffett once put it, when the tide goes out you learn who's been swimming naked - and as the water has receded rapidly down the beach, it has been possible for the first time in many years to see the UK economy as nature intended. And it is clear we are not getting a glimpse here of Botticelli's Venus.</p> <p>The markets have certainly come to the belated conclusion that the UK is mutton dressed up as lamb. Shares have bombed in London over the past month because of the recognition that the UK corporate sector is about to endure a long and painful recession, which will lead to a sharp reduction in profits. Sterling fell against the dollar last week by more than it did in the immediate aftermath of Black Wednesday in September 1992. Why? Because the UK has papered over the cracks of a hollowed-out industrial base by taking risky bets in the global financial markets. The epic scale of the UK's trade deficit has been disguised, up to a point, by the willingness of the City to act like a hedge fund - borrowing for short periods and lending for long periods. Hedge funds are risky businesses; they thrive in the good times but can go bust when the weather changes, as it has over the past year. In those circumstances, the foreign holders of sterling seem resolutely unconvinced by Brown's claim that Britain is better placed than before to ride out the storm. They have had a quick squint at the 6% of GDP trade deficit, the debt-sodden consumer, the crashing housing market - and headed straight for the exit.</p> <p>Again, it would be fatuous to make Brown the scapegoat for structural problems that have been long gestating. The brutal fact, though, is that the economy is more unbalanced after 11 years of Labour government; this is not, despite the hype, a knowledge economy fit to meet the challenges of the 21st century, it is a debt-dependent economy once again about to go into rehab.</p> <p>The cold turkey will be all the more painful because of the mess the Bank of England has made of setting interest rates. Monetary policy was kept far too tight for far too long: something only one member of the MPC appeared to realise as the economy headed unerringly towards the rocks over the past six months. While the Federal Reserve in the US was cutting interest rates aggressively to cushion the impact of recession, the MPC here was twittering away about inflation. The bank normally moves rates in quarter-point moves: it is now under pressure from the markets to reduce borrowing costs by a full point next week in order to make up for lost time. That's how far behind the curve it now is. If Mervyn King had been managing his beloved Aston Villa rather than a central bank, he would have been fired by now.</p> <p>And after the deluge, what then? It would be nice to report that lessons have been learned and that the future promises tougher controls on credit creation, the renaissance of the industrial base to meet the environmental challenge, the permanent cageing of the City. But do you honestly believe that is going to happen, whoever is in charge? No, me neither.</p> <p>\u2022 Larry Elliott is the Guardian's economics editor <br><a href=\"mailto:larry.elliott@guardian.co.u\">larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Sell Obamas now. They are overpriced and the forward market has gone crazy. If he becomes president, the bubble will burst, I guess in the spring of next year. From the moment four years ago when I first heard of Barack Obama and read his youthful memoir, I sensed a president in the making. Like the young Nelson Mandela in South Africa, he seemed to hold the aura of incipient national leadership. His range of sympathies, his oratory, his intelligence, his energy marked him out from the run. His embodiment of the American dream was astonishing.</p> <p>Today the outside world, much of it with a direct and painful interest in American policy, wants Obama to win, by leads of 20% to 60%. These people have no vote. But the narrower electorate of the United States appears also to want Obama to win, albeit by a smaller margin. The world prefers him chiefly because he is black, the latter chiefly because he is not Republican.</p> <p>Neither reason is robust. To most non-Americans, black is still code for being apart from the American establishment. Any visitor these days to Europe, to Africa or to the Muslim world is shocked by the depth of antipathy to the US. It is beyond ideology, a visceral, often racial aversion, unrelated to any personal attachment to individual Americans or their much-envied way of life. The ugly American is reborn.</p> <p>Yet the same visitor is impressed by how often he is assured that an Obama presidency would \"change everything\". The reason is not that Obama is anti-war or pro-Palestinian or left or rightwing. It is that his origins render him the one thing he most vociferously denies, not an ordinary American.</p> <p>To this world, Obama is a supposed representative of an oppressed class, however much his speech, manner and career bespeak the opposite. He is black and his name is confirmation enough. He symbolises the end of the Wasp ascendancy. The reason why his candidacy still discomforts many Americans is the reason the world craves it, that Obama is somehow unreal.</p> <p>He is a meta-American. It is why there will be an awful unleashing of grief and fury if he is not elected. Yet Obama is real, not just a human being but a politician. In office he knows he must do more than make fine speeches and castigate the government of the day. He must grapple with the wreckage of a world economy whose collapse is in large part due to the mismanagement of American finance, from which as a senator he cannot altogether escape blame.</p> <p>He must restore credit to markets and confidence to commerce. He must bring health and welfare to a country whose poor will seem ever more \"third world\", as unemployment bites in the coming months. To millions of Americans he will seem like a messiah. There are millions whom he can only disappoint.</p> <p>Abroad, this leader would have to end not one war but two, and bring sanity to an American diplomacy that is chaotic in an arc of instability from eastern Europe to the Himalayas. The anticipation that he will be a harbinger of peace, friendship and economic salvation is probably greater than for any American since Roosevelt. The burden of expectation is awesome and unrealistic.</p> <p>The qualities of charisma and rhetoric that Obama brings to this task may be a match for it. His declared policies are not. His desire to disengage from Iraq is not appreciably different from that of the Bush administration and the Iraqi government. On the other hand, his clearly expressed wish to beef up the war in Afghanistan is reckless.</p> <p>Obama has approved the bombing of targets inside Pakistan (and presumably now Syria) and proposed invasion to \"secure\" that country's nuclear arsenal. He has backtracked on compromise with Iran and done nothing to suggest an end to the macho provocation of Russia.</p> <p>At home Obama would appear from his statements and voting records to be a conventional Democrat, essentially tax, spend and protect with tariffs. While some of this is America's business, the world economy needs a protectionist US like a bullet in the head. American markets open to world goods are vital for recovery, as is America's active participation in the easing of world trade. Obama has shown no sign of accepting this.</p> <p>On all these fronts there is a more alarming prospect. It is that a Democratic president, even with an overwhelmingly Democratic Congress, must beware of seeming soft or dovish or \"appeasing terror\". Such is politics that the more liberal the man, the more illiberal he can feel compelled to behave, as was the case with Bill Clinton and Tony Blair. Obama has yet to indicate a retreat from the Patriot Act or the language of George Bush's war on terror.</p> <p>Any modern leader parrots the language of change. Obama proclaims himself the embodiment of a revolution in American public life. Yet his record is anything but radical. He even supports the right to bear arms. Were it not for his colour, he would be a candidate running on a conventional Democratic ticket, with few policies more constructive than those of his opponent, John McCain, on how the US might now escape from its many predicaments.</p> <p>None of this is an argument for not voting for Obama. In present day Washington even modest competence might seem revolutionary. But democratic leadership is like Icarus. Its wings melt as soon as it flies close to the sun. Obama is flying close indeed.</p> <p>The instant message that an Obama victory would flash round the world is not in doubt. It would transform and refresh the US's image, exhilarating its friends everywhere. It would restore to that country the reins of global leadership so missing in the era of Republican xenophobia. It would be an utterly good thing.</p> <p>The next message could be very different. The skills that Obama has brought to his campaign are essentially personal and organisational, not the superhuman ones that will be required of any occupant of the White House in the immediate future. The higher the anticipation, the more crippling will be the effort needed to meet it, and the greater the fall if it is not met.</p> <p>The prospect of a failed Obama presidency at some time in 2009-10, whether by his doing or those of circumstance, is heartbreaking to contemplate. It would more than undo the gains secured by his election and devastate the cause he is seen as representing. The least his supporters can do is not raise the bar of expectation too high.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:simon.jenkins@theguardian.com\">simon.jenkins@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown will this weekend call on China and oil-producing countries in the Gulf to pump hundreds of billions of dollars into the International Monetary Fund to prevent the global financial \"contagion\" from destroying vulnerable economies.</p> <p>As the IMF finalises plans to shore up the Hungarian and Ukrainian economies with combined loans of $29bn, the prime minister will make clear that more needs to be done to ensure the fund can step in to help struggling economies.</p> <p>Brown outlined his plans in Downing Street yesterday before flying to Paris for talks with the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy. \"The IMF has said it has $250bn available and new instruments to lend to countries in crisis,\" Brown said. \"But this may not be enough. It is becoming increasingly clear to me that we cannot delay and that we now need substantial resources in addition to the $250bn that the IMF already has available.</p> <p>\"We need this for the crisis that we face now in the 21st century ... It is necessary at this stage to prevent this international contagion and I believe we should take action on this new fund immediately.\"</p> <p>The prime minister will use a visit to the Gulf over the weekend and a telephone conversation with the Chinese prime minister, Wen Jiabao, later this week to say that countries with surpluses should take the burden of bolstering the IMF. China is estimated to have $1.7tn in reserves: some of this is allocated to Chinese sovereign wealth funds, but some is available in foreign exchange reserves.</p> <p>Brown said: \"I think it is the countries that have got substantial reserves, the oil-rich countries and others who are going to be the biggest contributors to this fund. Obviously I am going to the Gulf at the weekend and it is one of the items that will be on the discussion with all the international leaders. China also has very substantial reserves.\"</p> <p>Brown has offered strong support to Dominique Strauss-Kahn, head of the IMF, who is negotiating two emergency loan packages to eastern European countries. Hungary, an EU member, needs a $12.5bn loan while Ukraine wants $16.5bn.</p> <p>Brown hopes to make progress on boosting the IMF ahead of a meeting of the G20 group of world leaders in Washington next month designed to pave the way for a major restructuring of the so-called Bretton Woods postwar world financial institutions, of which the IMF is a key component.</p> <p>Brown had what was described as a \"brainstorming session\" in Paris yesterday with Sarkozy, who will host an informal EU summit next Friday, one week before the Washington meeting. Brown will tomorrow hold talks in London with Angela Merkel, the German chancellor.</p> <p>In a gesture intended to underline their special relationship, Sarkozy hosted Brown at La Lanterne, his weekend residence in a lodge within the grounds of the Palace of Versailles, where he spent his wedding weekend and which he once used as a retreat with Carla Bruni. Sarkozy described the new close relationship with Britain as an \"entente formidable\" and said the two countries were working \"hand in hand\". He said that the EU, which already has \u20ac12bn of liquidity to respond to the crisis and support a number of member-states, should increase that capacity to \u20ac20bn. He said he had a \"very great interest\" in Brown's proposals on the IMF, and that countries must not just dwell on financial regulations and rebuilding capitalism, but also governance.</p> <p>The close French-British partnership - which French commentators put down to Sarkozy's burning desire to get results as European president and Brown's desire to turn round his fortunes at home - comes in contrast to tension between France and its traditional ally Germany over reactions to the crisis. Germany is holding back on Sarkozy's proposal for an economic government for the eurozone.</p> <p>Despite his string of high-profile meetings with international leaders, Sarkozy is under pressure in France to show that he is not just grandstanding on the world stage, but dealing with the economic fallout at home. As France threatens to slip back into its dark days of high unemployment, he unveiled a raft of national measures to secure contracts and limit job losses. </p> <p>The meeting in Paris came as Lord Mandelson warned that protectionist countries, which would like to exploit the financial crisis, should be resisted. In a speech in Moscow, the business secretary said: \"The case for globalisation has to be made. Failure to do so will see the advance of the forces of resource nationalism and economic isolationism at the expense of openness and prosperity.\"</p>",
  "<p>The prospect of fresh cuts in interest rates on both sides of the Atlantic helped propel Wall Street stocks to a dramatic rebound yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average surging to its second biggest points gain on record.</p> <p>The US blue chip index leapt 889 points to 9065, an increase of more than 10%, although most traders were not convinced that amounted to a turning point in the gloom surrounding global markets.</p> <p>\"Was there enough good news to warrant a 10% rally? No,\" said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jeffries &amp; Co in New York. \"It makes just as much sense as yesterday's 200 point drop in 10 minutes.\"</p> <p>Amid signs of bargain-hunting, buyers were encouraged by the prospect of a cut in US interest rates today. There was a smattering of good corporate news as a jump in profits at BP sent oil stocks flying and a possible end to a strike at Boeing sent the aerospace firm's shares up by 14%.</p> <p>In London, the City was braced for a fresh cut in interest rates after two members of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee dropped the broadest of hints that they were ready to vote for anti-recessionary measures next week.</p> <p>Tim Besley, who sought costlier borrowing in August and has been the most hawkish member of the monetary policy committee, said he was no longer as concerned about the risks from inflation and the signs were that the economy was likely to weaken further after its 0.5% decline in the three months to September.</p> <p>\"As you will know,\" Besley said in a speech in London, \"there was a time last summer when I judged the upside inflationary risks to be sufficient to warrant an increase in bank rate ... But since then, the sharp fall in commodity prices and the consequently more benign prospects for food and services inflation, as well as the substantial weakening in demand, imply that the upside risks to inflation have diminished significantly.\"</p> <p>Besley added that despite the government's plan to inject capital into Britain's banks, credit conditions would remain tight. \"It is less likely that the rebalancing process for the UK will be as gentle as thought one year ago.\"</p> <p>His remarks came after the Bank's deputy governor for financial stability, Sir John Gieve, said the instability in markets over the past year had \"been the most severe in living memory.\" The \"severity and breadth of the downswing,\" which culminated in the \"seizure of money markets in recent weeks,\" had taken markets, policymakers and commentators by surprise. Besley and Gieve voted for the half-point cut in the bank rate to 4.5% this month, and the City expects at least another half-point reduction when the MPC meets next week. Some analysts believe the poor state of the economy may prompt a full-point cut to 3.5%.</p> <p>Shares in London halted their decline. The FTSE 100 rose almost 2%, while the pound steadied against the dollar at about $1.56. Wall Street's surge lifted markets in Brazil and Mexico.</p> <p>Despite yesterday's breathing space, Alistair Darling will use his Mais lecture at the Cass business school in the City tonight to argue that policymakers will have to adapt their approach. \"Many of the recent events in the banking system would have been unimaginable less than a year ago,\" the chancellor will say. \"Few predicted that each of the five large Wall Street investment banks either merged, sought government help or collapsed.</p> <p>\"Today, governments all over the world are using approaches that had until recently been consigned to policymaking history. But it is natural that the conduct of policy should evolve. Just as markets change, so should policy.\"</p>",
  "<p>The world is heading for an \"ecological credit crunch\" far worse than the current financial crisis because humans are over-using the natural resources of the planet, an international study warns today.</p> <p>The Living Planet report calculates that humans are using 30% more resources than the Earth can replenish each year, which is leading to deforestation, degraded soils, polluted air and water, and dramatic declines in numbers of fish and other species. As a result, we are running up an ecological debt of $4tr (\u00a32.5tr) to $4.5tr every year - double the estimated losses made by the world's financial institutions as a result of the credit crisis - say the report's authors, led by the conservation group WWF, formerly the World Wildlife Fund. The figure is based on a UN report which calculated the economic value of services provided by ecosystems destroyed annually, such as diminished rainfall for crops or reduced flood protection.</p> <p>The problem is also getting worse as populations and consumption keep growing faster than technology finds new ways of expanding what can be produced from the natural world. This had led the report to predict that by 2030, if nothing changes, mankind would need two planets to sustain its lifestyle. \"The recent downturn in the global economy is a stark reminder of the consequences of living beyond our means,\" says James Leape, WWF International's director general. \"But the possibility of financial recession pales in comparison to the looming ecological credit crunch.\"</p> <p>The report continues: \"We have only one planet. Its capacity to support a thriving diversity of species, humans included, is large but fundamentally limited. When human demand on this capacity exceeds what is available - when we surpass ecological limits - we erode the health of the Earth's living systems. Ultimately this loss threatens human well-being.\" Speaking yesterday in London, the report's authors also called for politicians to mount a huge international response in line with the multibillion-dollar rescue plan for the economy. \"They now need to turn their collective action to a far more pressing concern and that's the survival of all life on planet Earth,\" said Chief Emeka Anyaoku, the president of WWF International.</p> <p>Sir David King, the British government's former chief scientific adviser, said: \"We all need to agree that there's a crisis of understanding, that we're removing the planet's biodiverse resources at a rate which is as fast if not faster than the world's last great extinction.\"</p> <p>At the heart of the Living Planet report is an index of the health of the world's natural systems, produced by the Zoological Society of London and based on 5,000 populations of more than 1,600 species, and on an \"ecological footprint\" of human demands for goods and services.</p> <p>For the first time the report also contains detailed information on the \"water footprint\" of every country, and claims 50 countries are already experiencing \"moderate to severe water stress on a year-round basis\". It also shows that 27 countries are \"importing\" more than half the water they consume - in the form of water used to produce goods from wheat to cotton - including the UK, Switzerland, Austria, Norway and the Netherlands.</p> <p>Based on figures from 2005, the index indicates global biodiversity has declined by nearly a third since 1970. Breakdowns of the overall figure show the tropical species index fell by half and the temperate index remained stable but at historically low levels. Divided up another way, indices for terrestrial, freshwater and marine species, and for tropical forests, drylands and grasslands all showed significant declines. Of the main geographic regions, only the Nearctic zone around the Arctic sea and covering much of North America showed no overall change.</p> <p>Over the same period the ecological footprint of the human population has nearly doubled, says the report. </p> <p>At that rate humans would need two planets to provide for their wants in the 2030s, two decades earlier than the previous Living Planet report forecast just two years ago. This figure is \"conservative\" as it does not include the risk of a sudden shock or \"feedback loop\" such as an acceleration of climate change, says the report. But it warns: \"The longer that overshoot persists, the greater the pressure on ecological services, increasing the risk of ecosystem collapse, with potentially permanent losses of productivity.\"</p> <p>In the 1960s most countries lived within their ecological resources. But the latest figures show that today three-quarters of the world's population live in countries which consume more than they can replenish. </p> <p>Addressing concerns that national boundaries are an artificial way of dividing up the world's resources, Leape says: \"It's another way of reminding ourselves we're living beyond our means.\"</p> <p>The US and China account for more than two-fifths of the planet's ecological footprint, with 21% each. </p> <p>A person's footprint ranges vastly across the globe, from eight or more \"global hectares\" (20 acres or more) for the biggest consumers in the United Arab Emirates, the US, Kuwait and Denmark, to half a hectare in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Afghanistan and Malawi. The global average consumption was 2.7 hectares a person, compared with a notional sustainable capacity of 2.1 hectares.</p> <p>The UK, with an average footprint of about 5.5 hectares, ranks 15th in the world, just below Uruguay and the Czech Republic, and ahead of Finland and Belgium.</p>",
  "<p>Repossessions soared by 71% in the three months to the end of June as increasing numbers of homeowners struggled to meet their monthly mortgage repayments.</p> <p>The Financial Services Authority yesterday said that lenders had repossessed 11,054 homes in the second quarter of this year, compared with just 6,476 in the same period a year ago.</p> <p>The figures reflect the strain that homeowners in the UK are under as the credit crisis has resulted in a rapid rise in mortgage costs over the past year, on top of other rising household bills. The FSA also found more homeowners falling into arrears: 312,000 loan accounts in the three months to the end of June, 16% up on a year earlier.</p> <p>Adam Sampson, the chief executive of homelessness charity Shelter, said the number of people calling Shelter for advice on repossessions has surged by 167% in the past six months. </p> <p>\"These figures are not only shocking and worse than expected, they highlight the crippling severity of the credit crunch on ordinary homeowners,\" he said.</p> <p>\"It is easy for the FSA to issue new figures highlighting the problem, but as the key financial regulatory body it must start using its teeth to stop lenders rushing to court to repossess people's homes.\"</p> <p>The prime minister, Gordon Brown, last week announced that from November 19, lenders must explore options to help people stay in their homes, such as extending their mortgage term, changing the type of mortgage, deferring payment of interest and adding arrears to the overall loan.</p> <p>The Council for Mortgage Lenders predicted last year that there would be around 45,000 repossessions this year. The FSA's figures are broadly in line with the prediction.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrats' Treasury spokesman, Vince Cable, said: \"Today's repossession figures reinforce the warnings that the Liberal Democrats have given for a long time. The collapsing housing bubble will produce large numbers of casualties. The number of homeowners who have borrowed more than 3.5 times their income has shot up to over one third. Many of those people are now at great risk. If conditions deteriorate further, the current stream of repossessions will become a torrent.\"</p> <p>The FSA figures also showed that gross lending fell by 26% in the three months to June, compared to the same period a year ago. \"Significantly fewer\" new loans had been given to people who could only offer a 10% deposit - down from 15% of new lending in early 2007 to 10%.</p> <p>The Land Registry said the average price of a home in England and Wales fell 2.2% last month, and 8% in the year to September. These were the sharpest drops since the survey started in 2000.</p> <p>Howard Archer at consultants Global Insight said: \"The fundamentals continue to be largely stacked against the housing market, and it seems odds-on that prices will fall considerably further.\"</p> <p>The Bank of England added to the mounting pile of gloomy data yesterday when it predicted that about 1.2m households could fall into negative equity if the housing slump continues.</p> <p>In its twice-yearly Financial Stability Report, the bank said a 15% drop in prices from their October 2007 peak would leave one in 10 homeowners with outstanding mortgage debt worth more than the value of their home. \"Forecasts suggest further falls, although the size of these falls is highly uncertain,\" the report said.</p>",
  "<h2>Autism alert</h2> <p>Stuart Dakers's lengthy meditation on autism (Real estate, October 22) was ill-informed, unhelpful and frankly insulting to the many people with autism who are not remotely \"hyper-male\", or even male; he seems completely unaware of the large number of autistic girls and women, and has clearly never met people with autism brought up in environments that bear no relationship to the toxic ones he encounters in his work.</p> <p>Autism is neither characterised nor diagnosed by the sort of behaviours he describes but by a set of diagnostic criteria that identify a disorder of social communication, not a personality type. I have met scores of children, adults and teenagers with autism as the governor of a special school and through voluntary groups, and I can assure him that the vast majority bear no resemblance to the boys he describes. Did he get his ideas about causation of autism from a wacky internet site? </p> <p>Most of us can do no damage if we create idiosyncratic theories about disability that attribute them to the parents/environment, but as a Guardian columnist Dakers can - and undoubtedly has.<br><strong>Alison Kinneavy, </strong>Sheffield </p> <p>\u2022 This article is in the main highly offensive. The terminology used is detrimental to this often very vulnerable population and the arguments are archaic in the extreme. It is rare indeed that people with autism are \"endlessly competitive\" Individuals are by no means emotional and social misfits. There is little or no good epidemiological evidence that there is an autism epidemic. Certainly, individuals are getting diagnosed at a higher rate, but this does not mean that there are more people around all of a sudden, just that we are getting better at recognising it.<br><strong>Luke Beardon, </strong>senior lecturer in autism, The Autism Centre, Sheffield Hallam University. </p> <h2>No way into work</h2> <p>Disability Alliance has supported the government's ambitions to change the nature of incapacity benefit (Sick of the system, October 22). To this end, we feel that employment and support allowance (ESA) may be a step in the right direction but, as your article clearly articulates, there are still more changes to the rules of entitlement that could be made to the advantage of all concerned.</p> <p>We are concerned that the focus for helping disabled people into work appears to be approaching individual claimants as the problem, with a punitive approach increasingly being applied in terms of responsibilities and financial sanctions. The failure to recognise wider systemic discrimination and the avoidance of giving employers the responsibility to support disabled employees within welfare reforms is a very worrying sign.<br><strong>Paul Treloar, </strong>director of policy and services, Disability Alliance. </p> <p>\u2022 Like most discussion of the integration of sick and disabled people into society, Melissa Viney's account focuses on inclusion in the workforce. But even the stringent new benefits regulations recognise that this is not possible for the severely incapacitated. Even in better economic times, some people will always be unemployable. There has been little discussion of how to foster a sense of dignity and social membership in those for whom entry into the workforce is not a realistic or reasonable prospect. <br><strong>Patricia de Wolfe, </strong>London </p> <h2>Caring about carers</h2> <p>It is difficult to see how the 480,000 carers in receipt of carer's allowance would not be deeply concerned with the suggestion that their benefit could be removed (Recognition is vital, Social Care supplement, October 22). The \"package of support\" available to carers - breaks, expenses, emotional support and back-up emergency care - must be delivered alongside, not instead of, financial support. Giving this limited range of services to carers in exchange for carer's allowance would be a deeply retrograde step. </p> <p>That is why Carers UK is calling for urgent reform of carers' benefits, to recognise the huge contribution that carers make, compensate them for the costs of caring, allow them to combine care with work and study, and put an end to the injustice of carers falling into poverty.<br><strong>Imelda Redmond</strong>, chief executive Carers UK</p> <p>More at <a href=\"http://SocietyGuardian.co.uk/letters\">SocietyGuardian.co.uk/letters</a></p>",
  "<p>Iraq's government rebuked Washington yesterday for launching a military raid into neighbouring Syria from Iraqi soil, while Damascus retaliated by ordering a US school and cultural centre to be closed.</p> <p>In a brief public comment more than 24 hours after the special forces strike, an Iraqi government spokesman, Ali al-Dabbagh, said Baghdad rejected raids on its neighbours and did not want to be used as a launch pad.</p> <p>\"The constitution does not allow Iraq to be used as a staging ground to attack neighbouring countries,\" Dabbagh said, though he also called for an end to insurgent activity in Syria.</p> <p>The Syrian foreign minister, Walid al-Moualem, last night said Iraqi officials had \"started to see the truth\" about the raid. </p> <p>Damascus took its first reprisals against Sunday's raid by ordering the indefinite closure of the American school and a cultural centre. Both cater to the small US community and other expatriates in the Syrian capital. The Syrian cabinet said the US had violated the UN charter and international law with its raid. </p> <p>Syria's ambassador to the UN called for action to prevent a repeat attack. In a letter to the secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, Bashar Ja'afari said that the council holds the US \"politically\" and \"legally\" responsible. According to Syria, US troops, backed by helicopters, launched the attack near Abu Kamal, five miles into its territory, killing eight people including four children.</p> <p>US officials in Baghdad have refused to comment on the attack. However, officials in Washington and in the Iraqi government have claimed a henchman of the slain former leader of al-Qaida in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, was killed in the raid on a compound in Sukkariyeh.</p> <p>The man was identified as Abu Ghadiyah. Iraqi media also claimed that at least one man was captured and flown into Iraq by US forces, who disembarked from two of four helicopters. At least eight people are thought to have been killed.</p> <p>The Associated Press quoted a senior US official as saying Abu Ghadiyah was the leader of the most prolific network that moves foreign fighters linked to al-Qaida into Iraq, and was planning an attack within Iraq. \"The tripwire was knowing an attack was imminent, and also being able to pinpoint his location,\" the official told Associated Press.</p> <p>Officials in Baghdad say the Syrian town targeted during the raid was a major supply line to the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, from where intelligence suggests insurgents are staging what amounts to a last stand in Iraq. Mosul is also seen as a supply line north to Afghanistan, which many in Iraq believe is fast emerging as a new frontline for foreign Arab fighters committed to the global jihad ideology.</p> <p>The Iraqi army now has partial control of Anbar province, which stretches west from Baghdad towards the Syrian border. The province was dubbed the triangle of death in the early days of the US-led occupation and remained a hotbed of militant activity and attacks against coalition forces through four years of often blazing insurgency.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Thursday October 30 2008</strong></p> <p>In the article below we said that a German financial daily, Handelsblatt, had reported that the London-based hedge fund manager Marshall Wace lost more than \u20ac5bn through its short positions on Volkswagen. Marshall Wace has since said that this is incorrect and that its loss is immaterial at less than 0.2% of total funds under management. </p> <p> </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/automotive\">automotive industry</a> is on its knees. General Motors is burning through $1bn a month and is worth a fraction of what it was. Other manufacturers including Ford and Honda are cutting production. </p> <p>But Volkswagen, the business that gave the world the Beetle and the camper van, found itself the most valuable company in the developed world yesterday, the result of another bout of financial speculation that went spectacularly wrong. </p> <p>Panic-buying by hedge funds drove the company's share price into the stratosphere, allowing VW at one point to leapfrog oil giant ExxonMobil to become the biggest company by stockmarket value at just short of a staggering \u20ac300bn (\u00a3240bn). Amid the buying frenzy, the shares touched \u20ac1,005 each, five times the level at which they were changing hands on Friday.</p> <p>VW was worth more than US grocer Wal-Mart, the world's biggest group by sales in this year's Fortune 500 list, Microsoft and General Electric - and substantially more than all of America's and Europe's car-makers combined.</p> <p>But its gain was the hedge funds' loss. The German financial daily Handelsblatt reported that London-based Marshall Wace lost more than \u20ac5bn, and two New York funds, Perry Capital and Greenlight Capital, lost billions each.</p> <p>Amid pandemonium on Frankfurt's stock exchange, VW shares experienced a rollercoaster ride before ending 82% higher on the day at \u20ac945, valuing the group at \u20ac280bn.</p> <p>The panic-buying, which began on Monday, came after hedge funds were caught short by Sunday's announcement from the luxury car-maker Porsche that it had seized 74.1% of VW.</p> <p>With the federal state of Lower Saxony holding a further 20.2% in VW, that left just 5.7% of the firm's shares traded freely. With global car companies in freefall as the recession bites into sales and profits, the funds bet hugely on VW's stock falling dramatically. In market parlance, they \"shorted\" VW shares by \"borrowing\" and then selling them in the hope they could buy them back at a much reduced price.</p> <p>Porsche's announcement forced them to close their positions by chasing the few shares on offer and paying ever-higher prices for them. They dumped stocks in Germany's top companies to pay for scarce VW stock.</p> <p>Some fund managers were reportedly in tears as they realised the scale of their losses - estimated to be as high as \u20ac30bn, and bringing out a large dose of schadenfreude among market watchers. Many funds, derided as asset-stripping locusts in Germany, are facing ruin. This week's frenzied buying of VW shares is the latest stage in the saga of Porsche's single-minded pursuit of VW, a process that has seen the two controlling families, the Piechs and the Porsches, engage in open warfare for control, often indulging in public slanging matches.</p> <p>Porsche made its declaration only days after Ferdinand Piech, VW's chairman, settled his differences with Wolfgang Porsche, the smaller company's chairman.</p> <p>The effective takeover by Porsche is an extraordinary coup for a company that almost went bankrupt 15 years ago. VW's annual sales of \u20ac100bn dwarf its \u20ac7.5bn turnover. VW sells 6m cars a year and wants to overtake Toyota as the biggest car firm in the world; Porsche sells 100,000. But Stuttgart-based Porsche enjoys the healthiest profit margins among global car-makers, largely thanks to its obscure financial dealings in swaps and options.</p> <p>Under German corporate law it doesn't have to declare these options, laying it open to the charge that it is taking over VW by stealth. It said on Sunday it would acquire directly more than 50% by December, and 75% in 2009.</p> <p>Porsche's dealings have brought Germany's stockmarket system into disrepute, with investors, fund managers and analysts crying foul and demanding the suspension of VW shares from the Dax index and an inquiry by regulators into alleged manipulation and insider trading.</p> <p>But a Porsche spokesman said the company \"utterly rejects\" these allegations: \"It's the funds themselves which are responsible, with their huge bets on a fall in VW shares which never happened.\"</p> <p>Germany's financial services authority, BaFin, and market regulators held back from direct intervention despite pressure from investors. But a BaFin spokeswoman indicated that the authority was scrutinising the deal very closely, with a possible view to mounting a full investigation.</p>",
  "<p>For horror film fanatic Leah Holmes, a tolerance of fear began at an early age. Her anaesthetist father \"had half a human skeleton which he used to get out to entertain me and my brother,\" she says, \"so I was very blas\u00e9 about scary things. Years later, he was trying to put me off becoming a pathologist, and gave me a book with graphic photos of dead bodies in it. I think he was trying to frighten me, but I just flicked through and thought, 'Oooh, interesting.'\" </p> <p>Holmes, who now works for SFX, a sci-fi, fantasy and horror magazine, isn't the only woman with a long-standing love of gore. For Ad\u00e8le Hartley, founder of Edinburgh's Dead by Dawn horror film festival, the attraction of scary movies is the sheer pleasure of leaving the cinema feeling physically changed. \"It's nice to watch a film which makes you glad to get home and put the lights on,\" she says. \"And there's nothing like going down a dark lane to your car after you've watched dozens of horror movies.\" </p> <p>When Hartley started Dead by Dawn 15 years ago, only a handful of women attended. These days, the audience is split 50/50. \"I'd like to think that the stereotype of lots of boys in black zombie T-shirts is finally going away,\" she says. \"They're not the majority any more.\" This is backed up by the new wave of print and online communities that have cropped up to address the female hunger for horror. </p> <p>Sites include Ax Wound (named after a derogatory term for a vagina), launched by fright fanatic Hannah D Forman. The site's mission is \"to provide a safe, stimulating environment for feminists who struggle with their enjoyment of these films\". It features essays by horror film enthusiasts and interviews with new film-makers who have torn up the rule book. One such film-making team is Gonzoriffic, a duo who happily admit to their lack of experience, budget and taste. Their brand of female-driven underground cinema has made Monica Puller, one half of Gonzorrific, a counter-culture poster girl. Then there's the Viscera Film Festival prize for short horror films produced by women, which offers its winner help with marketing and distribution.</p> <p>Heidi Martinuzzi, who runs horror networking website Pretty-Scary.net, says she has often felt that female horror talent has been ignored. \"You'll hear about really tiny indie projects by men, but not those by women. So we created a place where women could talk about horror without being harassed by teenagers.\" Martinuzzi's site includes a busy forum that allows female film-makers to swap tips on fake blood, ask the advice of Bambi-Lyn, their fictional Scream Queen agony aunt, and read news items about screenings. She's even written about where to buy your daughter's first Ouija board, \"because you're never too young to start screwing with stuff you shouldn't be screwing with!\" </p> <p>Martinuzzi's short film, Wretched, which she produced and co-directed, clearly explores female experiences. It follows a couple squabbling over dinner in a restaurant and the heroine's frequent trips to the ladies' room. \"I was bulimic for a long time,\" she says, \"and I always thought there was something incredibly terrifying about it. So in my film, rather than confront the argument, she keeps going to the bathroom to throw up. I found a way to include horror in that idea,\" she says. \"There's a lot of blood in it, let me put it that way.\"</p> <p>Body-horror is a popular subgenre for female fans, perhaps because, in Hartley's words, it is the female half of the species \"who have to deal with real horror - giving birth\". Faye Jackson's film, Lump, which was showcased at Dead by Dawn, depicts a woman suffering seemingly benign growths in her breast, and doctors failing to listen to her as they put her repeatedly under the knife. Jackson says she wanted to chronicle the indifference of some doctors, and contrast non-elective surgery with the rise of cosmetic procedures. </p> <p>\"I was a bit disgusted about how casual people have become about plastic surgery and so wanted to make a film about that.\" She is currently organising the publicity for her next film, a vampire movie set in Ceausescu's Romania.</p> <p>One of the aspects of horror that tends to put women off is the stereotype of a helpless, scantily clad female protagonist being chased by a slasher. \"Horror is a peculiar genre for women,\" says Holmes. \"On the one hand, there's a tradition of having a female victim, but then you also have the academic idea of the 'monstrous feminine' or female monster.\" She is fascinated by the raging little girls of Japanese horror, naming the character Sadako, from 1998's cult movie, Ring, as her favourite horror heroine ever. As for claims that horror largely casts women as limp victims, Hartley thinks this is unfair. \"Although a lot of horror is guilty of assuming that women are vulnerable, it's not as guilty as people think. There have always been horror films that have acknowledged women are infinitely smarter, less likely to go down to the basement and more likely to run away. Which, incidentally, is what you should do when confronted with a monster of any kind.\" </p> <p>Debbie Rochon, a host on US horror radio station Fangoria and veteran of more than 100 horror films, was inducted into the B-Movie Hall of Fame in 2004, and crowned Scream Queen of the Decade, 1990-2000 by Draculina magazine. She admits that nudity is often a requirement of the films she stars in, but says: \"In what other genre can you play characters that are so crazy and insane?\" And although she started out playing \"victim roles\", now \"in at least 75% of my roles, my character is left standing at the end. It's almost a credibility thing - if you're killed off at the beginning, it doesn't look good on your CV.\"</p> <p>While Rochon admits that she enjoys being drenched in red corn syrup, horror film-making has its drawbacks. She recounts an incident in which a prop knife was switched for a real machete. \"I was hacking up a body when my hand slipped and my fingers were literally cut off, everything apart from the bone - the nerves, the tendons, everything.\" She lists the ways in which her characters have been killed. \"I've had one of my breasts cut off with an axe and bled to death, I've been shot, drowned, had my head cut off, have been stabbed through the heart, and beaten to death ... I tend to get dispatched very quick, with a shotgun blast, or a Ouija board spell gone wrong.\"</p> <p>The recent emergence of \"torture porn\" - the term applied to films like Saw and Hostel, which are characterised by seemingly endless displays of violence - elicits an almost identical response from these female horror fans. They're bemused and a little bored by the idea. Rochon says it's become \"a showcase for the SFX artists' technical expertise\". Yet none of the women condones censorship in any form. As Martinuzzi says, \"I hate romantic comedies - but I don't think people should be stopped from making them.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Wednesday October 29 2008. We have corrected the name of the director of the short film Lump from Faye Tucker to Faye Jackson.</p>",
  "<p>Having joined the charity sector after my role as a prison governor at Brixton, I found this new environment to be one where I really could make things happen. As a consequence, I spent over 30 years managing a number of national and international organisations and campaigns. In my last permanent post I was chief executive of Vision 2020, the right to sight global campaign, and was previously the UK director of Save the Children and director general of the British Red Cross.</p> <p>Historically, resources have always been tight in the charity sector, which meant that as a high-profile chief executive people would often ask me if I knew someone who could help fill a gap or solve an immediate problem. I usually did. But the use of interim managers in charities was not common at the time.</p> <p>About four years ago I was looking for fresh challenges and decided to step down as chief executive of Vision 2020 and launch my own charities management consultancy. It was at that time I became aware of the interim managers market in the private sector and - along with my business colleague Stephen Brooker - decided there was merit in establishing a similar service for the charity sector. We felt this could particularly help small to medium-sized organisations in need of top-level expertise.</p> <p>But instead of creating our own interim management business we wanted to set up a charities practice within an established private sector interim management company. We decided to work with Russam GMS, one of the longest established providers. The advantage of taking this route was that we could create a combined database of potential interim managers with the necessary experience and skills - which today has well over 8,000 people on it. But it also meant we could bring more than 30 years of experience to Russam GMS, plus a long list of potential clients who would trust us.</p> <p>When we started the charity practice, we spent a lot of time explaining to charities the role and benefits of interim managers, as well as speaking at many charity events, and invested time and money in marketing the proposition. Now, a few years on, charities we speak to understand the value that interim mangers can bring and regularly use them. I spend most of my time nowadays working with charities to help them find the right person for the role. Even while writing this piece I have had to deal with two urgent requests for very senior people, one a managing director based in the UK and the other a role based in Dubai and the UK.</p> <p>I relish the work I do now. I do not regret not going back into a charity as a chief executive officer because by helping to place people in the interim sector I can help many charities fulfil their mission, no matter who are the beneficiaries.</p> <p>\u2022 Mike Whitlam is an interim manager consultant for the charity sector and a former charity chief executive.

  "<p>Sleek, low-slung and preferably black, it was once an object of desire for every Soviet bureaucrat. Now, more than half a century after it was first produced, Russia is stopping production of the legendary Volga saloon.</p> <p>Once a symbol of stylish living and the preferred car of mid-level apparatchiki, the Volga has struggled to compete with the inomarki - foreign cars - that have flooded the automobile market since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.</p> <p>The car manufacturer, Gaz, owned by Oleg Deripaska, confirmed this week that mass production of the famous limousine will end within two months.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the company denied the decision was linked to the global financial crisis. \"The decision was taken earlier,\" she said. High prices demanded by suppliers of components and tough competition from cheap imported cars had sounded the Volga's death knell.</p> <p>Production of the Volga began in the \"thaw\" period in 1956, the year that the Soviet leader Khrushchev publicly denounced Stalin for his brutal rule. </p> <p>The first model, the Gaz-21, remains a classic and still has numerous fan clubs dedicated to it throughout Russia. Early models featured a five-pointed star on the radiator, a design personally endorsed by the Soviet war hero Marshall Zhukov.</p> <p>Russia's prime minister, Vladimir Putin, is an enthusiast and a Volga was the first car he owned. In 2005, he showed off the immaculately restored saloon to President Bush at a summit in Moscow. Bush initially had trouble using the manual gearstick mounted on the steering column, but then sped off across Putin's summer estate.</p> <p> \"When it first appeared we were proud that our country was capable of producing such a beautiful, elite car that was no worse than an American or British one,\" Vladislav Lazarenko, the founder of a Volga lovers' fan club in the central Russian city of Kostroma, said yesterday. \"There was a feeling of patriotism.\"</p> <p>But as the years went by production quality began to decline and after 1970 the basic product design, or \"platform\", hardly changed. \"They started to use cheaper and cheaper parts,\" said Lazarenko. \"The Volga got left behind as the global automobile industry took giant leaps forward,\" he said.</p> <p>With its woeful handling and shoddy interior the Volga was a poor competitor to Japanese and German cars that dominated the market in the post-communist era. </p> <p>Until recently, Moscow's New Yellow Taxi company had a large fleet of Volgas operating all over the city. Asked for his opinion on the demise of the car, one driver said: \"We don't use that piece of junk any more. We've got about 10 left but we want to get shot of them. Now we've got Fords. They're miles better.\"</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p>The first Volga, launched in 1956, was based on the Ford Crestline. Mass production began two years later. KGB operatives used high-powered versions of the car, with estate models later used as ambulances. Critics say the Volga handles like a boat, befitting of its name. In the post-Soviet era it struggled to compete with foreign cars such as the Mercedes, a favourite of Russian bureaucrats and gangsters.</p>",
  "<p>The purple GM tomatoes (Report, October 27) may well be a marvel of science, enhanced artificially as they are with anthocyanin. The even greater marvel is nature itself which, as you point out, provides this health-boosting antioxidant in fruits such as blackberry and blueberry. Rather than opting for such a \"techno-fix\", consumers would be far wiser to pursue a route of nutritional diversity across a wide range of foods. We already have the \"miracle\" of vitamin A-enhanced golden rice, which was trumpeted some years ago as being the malnutrition fix for the developing world.

  "<p>Jacqui Smith's announcement yesterday of tougher measures to exclude \"preachers of hate\" is the latest in a series of initiatives to prevent young British Muslims turning to violent extremism. A mushrooming array of guidelines for schools, colleges and councils emphasises the need to challenge the narrative al-Qaida uses to attract recruits.</p> <p>These guidelines do nothing to challenge the dominant narrative by which violent extremism is commonly explained, a narrative that sees even peaceful groups as transmission belts on which insecure Muslims are shuffled towards violence. However, there is a very different narrative of British Islam, which the government is less keen to talk about. There is a reason for that.</p> <p>The dominant story is of a second generation who grew up in the Paki-bashing 80s and suffered a profound identity crisis on reaching adulthood. Torn between the culturally based Islam of their families and the pressures of contemporary society, these Muslims proved easy prey for radicalisation by exiled clerics from hardline groups, who presented a narrative of historical oppression going back to the Crusades.</p> <p>With variants, that model is put forward by rightwing thinktanks, Conservative ideologues, former Hizb ut-Tahrir activists and erstwhile leftwingers. At its core is the idea that even non-violent organisations such as the Muslim Council of Britain and those connected with groups like the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood are on what the former left commentator Nick Cohen calls \"a continuum whose terminus is pathological hatred\". Or, as Newsnight's Richard Watson puts it: \"Today's suicide bombers are yesterday's Islamists.\"</p> <p>That narrative is powerfully countered in Race &amp; Class, the journal of the Institute of Race Relations (on whose board I sit). Arun Kundnani's article starts from the identity crisis of second-generation Muslims - but takes it in a very different direction. </p> <p>He explains the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood ideologue Sayyid Qutb, not in terms of his (undoubted) social fundamentalism, but of his insistence that it's up to individual Muslims how to interpret their religion. Echoing the Protestant reformation, Qutb advocated a global Islam, liberated from national forms. His vision gives Muslims an attachment to a world community; it is compatible with many aspects of modernity; and, on a personal level, it gives Muslims an Islamic excuse not to marry their cousins.</p> <p>For some, this blend of globalism and individualism explains the attraction of political Islam to the 7/7 bombers. But it also explains the trajectory of other Muslims, who have moved from youthful militancy towards a very different kind of engagement, a trajectory of which involvement in the anti-Iraq war movement is an obvious example.</p> <p>For Cohen, the Stop the War Coalition is an unholy alliance of a demoralised, morally relativist left and an \"Islamist far right\". If that were true, you would expect the left to sell out to Islamism on issues such as women's and gay rights, free speech and antisemitism, while the Islamists remained ideologically steadfast. In fact, far from dragging duped progressives towards a hardline Islamist agenda, much of the intellectual movement has been the other way.</p> <p>So, as Catholics picketed parliament for the right to discriminate against gay couples, the MCB issued a statement supporting the legislation on the grounds that, despite Islam's opposition to homosexuality, it \"stands opposed to discrimination in all its forms\". Rightly, and not before time, the MCB has lifted its boycott of Holocaust Day. In a Guardian article last year, the former Young Muslim student activist Inayat Bunglawala (now of the MCB) reiterated the importance of the anti-Satanic Verses campaign, but said that he was wrong to call for it to be banned. Similarly, the MCB didn't call for the banning of Fitna, the anti-Islam film by the Dutch MP Geert Wilders, on the grounds that (as Bunglawala put it), the \"same freedoms which allow Wilders to taunt Muslims so openly are also the ones which allow Muslims and others to spread the teachings of their faith\". </p> <p>The co-chair of the February 2003 Iraq war march, Anas Altikriti of the British Muslim Initiative, points out that the Qur'an says nothing about homosexuality beyond relaying the Biblical story of Sodom and Gomorrah. The Birmingham Respect councillor Salma Yaqoob has consistently opposed bans of and protests against anti-Muslim material. Influenced by Abdelwahab El-Affendi (author of Who Needs an Islamic State?) and the international scholar Tariq Ramadan, these Muslims are seeking to build a distinctly European Islam that sits easily with western pluralism and its political processes, without having to sacrifice the essentials of their beliefs.</p> <p>So why is this narrative not trumpeted in the myriad guidelines on combating extremism? It's not Muslim views on halal meat or the hijab that bother the government, but their views on other matters. All these activists oppose the government's attacks on civil liberties. Like the 7/7 bombers, they were politicised not by Afghanistan or Iraq but by the Bosnian war, and the sight of western countries standing by while Muslims were dispossessed, raped and murdered on Europe's eastern doorstep. They see no reason to keep quiet about their views of western foreign policy now. As Yaqoob puts it, the huge support for the February 2003 march - particularly from middle England - led many Muslims to feel they belonged to Britain for the first time. </p> <p>On these pages, Ziauddin Sardar has argued that the problem with the ex-Islamist Quilliam Foundation is not that it is anti-fundamentalist or anti-segregationist, but that it is anti-political; it wants Muslims to keep quiet. In fact, as Kundnani argues, a whole generation of British Muslims has rejected \"the folkoric religio-cultural practices of their parents\" in search of new ways of being Muslim, in public, in contemporary Europe. What could be more welcome?</p> <p>\u2022 David Edgar is a playwright. Arun Kundnani's Islamism and the Roots of Liberal Rage is in the latest issue of Race &amp; Class.
