  "<p>Paedophiles are increasingly targeting babies and children too young to speak in an orchestrated strategy to avoid being caught, police have revealed.</p> <p>The disturbing revelation came as Scotland Yard warned that the threat facing society from child abuse is far graver than previously assumed, with 'huge' numbers of paedophiles scouring the internet for potential victims. </p> <p>As the furore over the arrival of paedophile Gary Glitter rumbled on last night, detectives from Britain's Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP) revealed that they were uncovering growing evidence that paedophiles were concentrating on 'pre-verbal' victims. </p> <p>CEOP spokesman Vicky Gillings said officers were finding an increasing number of images, many showing the raping of babies, involving youngsters whose inability to describe their abuse made them attractive to paedophiles. </p> <p>Detective Chief Inspector Nick Stevens, head of the Metropolitan Police's paedophile unit, said: 'There are huge numbers of paedophiles online, surfing the net and looking for child abuse images, at any one time. </p> <p>'The problem is far, far larger than anyone is aware of. Ten years ago the Metropolitan Police seized perhaps a few thousand images a year. Now you're talking millions.' He added that the middle classes had to start accepting that large numbers of paedophiles came from professional backgrounds. Last Friday Martin Hatcher, 46, an NHS scientist from Exeter, was jailed for downloading more than 270,000 child abuse pictures. </p> <p>With the true scale of paedophilia in Britain impossible to quantify, Jim Warnock, head of operations at the CEOP, said hundreds of online paedophile networks had yet to be uncovered and that such was the size of the problem that as many as one in six children - 1.9 million - might be a victim of abuse. Detectives describe the 30,000 Britons currently on the sex offenders register as the tip of the iceberg. </p> <p>Last night former glam-rock singer Glitter, whose real name is Paul Gadd, had yet to sign the register or notify police of where he plans to live in Britain, despite being given a deadline of tomorrow by police. </p> <p>The 64-year-old arrived in the UK after being freed from a Vietnamese prison after serving two years and nine months for sexually abusing two girls aged 10 and 11. </p> <p>The Observer has learned that British police failed to issue an official warning to police in other countries that the convicted sex offender planned to travel abroad in 2001, a failure that experts say made it easier for Glitter to reoffend. He was placed on the sex offenders register in 1999 for seven years after he was jailed in the UK for four months for possessing 4,000 images of child abuse.</p> <p>Sources from Interpol have revealed that UK police should have contacted them to issue a 'green notice', an official international warning that alerts foreign forces to the movements of a sex abuser deemed likely to reoffend in other countries. If a green notice had been ordered, Glitter would have been met by police wherever he travelled - officers greeted him when he arrived at Heathrow Airport on Friday. </p> <p>Glitter was expelled from Cambodia in 2002 after allegations of sex crimes against children, and moved to Vung Tau in Vietnam, where he was convicted in 2006 of abusing two under-age girls who initially made allegations of rape against him, although eventually Glitter stood trial accused of obscene acts with children. </p> <p>Kristin Kvigne, head of the child abuse unit at Interpol, said: 'Green notices are being gravely underused by too many countries. We feel there is a responsibility to protect children in other countries and that is why they are a useful tool.' </p> <p>The issue of ensuring that countries including the UK issue more green notices to prevent paedophiles reoffending will be raised at Interpol's general assembly in Russia this October. 'We are trying to encourage more police forces to use them,' admitted Gillings. </p> <p>Of concern to detectives are the increasing numbers of babies and 'non-verbal' victims being preyed upon by paedophiles aware that many abusers are caught after their victims tell adults they have been targeted. Gillings said: 'We have seen an increase in images of \"pre-verbal\" victims who are being deliberately groomed because they cannot describe their abuse. They are part of a trend towards more images of younger and younger victims.' </p> <p>She added that the actual images were becoming more depraved, with greater quantities of 'level-five' pictures - involving sadism or an animal - being found by officers tracking online paedophile networks. A Northamptonshire couple were jailed three months ago for abusing a four-month-old baby girl and disseminating footage of the abuse on the internet. Officers from CEOP were tipped off by the FBI, who had arrested an American paedophile who had film on his computer of the baby being abused. </p> <p>During the past year more than 130 British children have been rescued by CEOP officials from paedophiles, the majority from their own homes. </p> <p>Last week it emerged that another 15 British children have been saved from a life of sexual abuse after undercover police infiltrated a global internet paedophile ring. Philip Thompson, 27, from Cleveland, called the 'librarian' by police, was given an indeterminate prison sentence and must serve at least three years and nine months. Officers recovered a million images and films of children stored on his computer which he distributed to thousands of members, most of them British. The CEOP helpline receives hundreds of calls a month from children who believe they have been approached by a paedophile on the internet.</p> <p>Although Thompson fitted the image of a dysfunctional loner, Stevens said many paedophiles often seemed respectable. 'Look at the professions of the people we are arresting - police officers, teachers and those who are often closely involved with children's groups, helping Cubs, Brownies, sporting clubs. </p> <p>'In fact, the more respectable someone is can make them more dangerous by making it easier for them to gain the trust of their intended victim. We need to get every aspect of society to understand that this is a massive problem,' Stevens said. </p> <p>Restricted Scotland Yard documents reveal that Britain's child abusers are predominantly white males aged 36 to 45. Almost all have no previous convictions of sexual abuse. Those recently caught include teachers, politicians, accountants, police officers and lawyers. Many are family men who make victims of their own children. 'This isn't a crime limited to any special classes or young and old, although it is true that white middle-aged men are those we predominantly see abusing children,' said Warnock. </p> <p>Detectives believe that the proliferation of child abuse sites has created more paedophiles than they would otherwise expect. A 'spiral of abuse' has been identified by CEOP whereby paedophiles are initially satisfied by searching for images until eventually they desire 'contact', actual physical sexual abuse. </p> <p>Warnock said: 'The internet has brought opportunities for paedophiles to glorify and revictimise. They enjoy and share images and this can normalise behaviour.'</p> <p>This week officers from the Met's paedophile unit will continue to pose in chatrooms as children to lure predatory paedophiles to reveal themselves. Since the Yard began using undercover officers in online forums in 2006, scores of arrests have been made. Sources say it has been another 'busy summer', with the long school holidays a prime time for those who prey on children.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's biggest arms manufacturer has abandoned plans to produce 'green bullets' two years after promising major investment in ecologically sound weaponry. British Aerospace had wanted to produce bullets tipped with tungsten instead of lead but sources say that higher production costs made the venture unprofitable. </p> <p>Last week the company, one of the world's largest arms-makers, signed a 15-year deal with the Ministry of Defence to supply Britain's armed forces with some 230 million rounds of small arms and medium-calibre ammunition a year. </p> <p>The MoD said that the deal, initially worth about \u00a32bn, would secure supplies of ammunition to frontline troops in conflict zones such as Afghanistan.</p>",
  "<p>What makes a great city? One part of any definition almost certainly includes water. And where you have water, human ingenuity insists on spanning it. So, great cities always have bridges and tunnels. It's hilarious, but telling, that Manhattanites stigmatise outsiders as 'bridge and tunnel folk'. The BNTs are untouchables forced to access the pleasure and promise of New York by paying tribute to civil engineering.</p> <p>Unlike tunnels which are, for obvious reasons, usually invisible, bridges have enormous presence. Much like bicycles, bridges are a rare example of technology with no downside. A new bridge always brings social and commercial benefits. Moreover, an unnegotiable requirement that designers follow the stern laws of physics often makes bridges into beautiful diagrams of natural forces expressed in concrete, wood or steel. </p> <p>And there is an essential poetry to any structure which actually creates new opportunities, new space and new vistas: the views seen from Norman Foster's Millennium Bridge between St Paul's Cathedral and Tate Modern had never, ever been enjoyed before. At the same time, hitherto moribund parts of the city were vitalised. </p> <p>But there are exceptions to the bridges-are-beautiful rule, notably the motorway programme begun by the Ministry of Transport with the Newport Bypass of 1945. Still, even here the best bridges have a commanding functional austerity: with the M1 the engineer Sir Owen Williams built 131 of them in 19 months. (And his own ingenuity found expression in cannily keeping the copyright of the M1 designs and then selling them back to the Ministry when they needed to start 'road improvements').</p> <p>Nicely combining art and engineering, bridge design belongs to both architecture and engineering (although at the Millennium Bridge the sculptor Anthony Caro got a credit too). But in recent years, architects have become ever more interested in them, even usurping the engineers with the bylines. There was a time when every architect wanted to design a chair (whose structural duties make them similar to bridges). But now, evidence of the organically enlarging egos of topline architects, only a bridge will do. Santiago Calatrava made his global reputation with audaciously elegant bridges before he ever applied his idiosyncratic handwriting to buildings.</p> <p>The latest? Zaha Hadid's 260m long pedestrian bridge-pavilion straddling the Ebro at the current Zaragoza Expo. The inhabited bridge is an idea Hadid has been playing with since 1977 when her graduation project proposed a hotel on London's Hungerford Bridge. In 1996 Hadid won the Royal Academy's 'Living Bridges' design competition and the exhibition of the same name, historians may conclude, marked the beginning of this moment when bridges have become showpieces of an architect's, rather than an engineer's, credentials.</p> <p>Of course, the new generation of high-concept bridges requires extraordinarily complex engineering calculations to achieve commodity and firmness, but they are no longer, if they ever were, a routine structural means of connecting two points separated by Nature. Compression and tension, the 'recursive art' of truss design, now take their place behind expression and social purpose. The new bridges are not even the shortest route between two points - they're just the most interesting. </p> <p>At Temple Quay in Bristol, Niall McLaughlin Architects has made a bridge that was prefabricated in eight sections and just recently lifted into place. The various loads and stresses (calculated by Price &amp; Myers Geometrics) have been turned into decorative perforations which vary in size with the local forces.</p> <p>Last year at the University of Limerick Wilkinson Eyre completed a 'living bridge' across the River Shannon. Its structure allows unobstructed views whose first purpose is to delight, but whose underlying purpose is to create a new dynamic in campus life. In 2003 the same architects spanned Floral Street in London's Covent Garden, a sort of Bridge of Thighs, to connect the Royal Ballet School with the Royal Opera House: as simple in concept as it is thrilling to see, more than 20 identical box sections were twisted like a pack of cards and shuffled through space. </p> <p>This year Wilkinson Eyre completed the Paradise Street Bridge in Liverpool, another subtle formal idea: like aerial origami, its thinnest point is in the middle which creates a strange visual ambiguity. Sure, it only connects a department store with a car park, but why shouldn't such a thing be beautiful?</p> <p>If new bridges have landmark roles (and the astonishing Millau Viaduct in France has become a 'vaut le voyage' in its own right), then it is also becoming better understood what social benefits arise from bridge-building, an act whose metaphorical weight proves the psychological significance of these structures. The desolate Thames Gateway (which we now have to call a Wetlands Natural Park) may yet feature a dramatic and exciting new bridge. </p> <p>At depressed Castleford in West Yorkshire, a new bridge by architects McDowell+Benedetti is the starting point for an urgent regeneration programme begun in 2003 and now championed by Kevin McCloud on TV (starting tomorrow on Channel 4). Over a river the residents preferred to use as a tip rather than a landscape asset, there is now an elegant, sinuous footbridge that will be lit at night: a deck of cumaru (more than twice as dense as oak) is supported by three dramatic V-shape steel pylons. Architect Renato Benedetti says it is 'more than a crossing, it's a new public space'.</p> <p>An astonishing new public space of a very different sort has been created at Kew by Marks Barfield: this is Xstrata, an imaginative walkway-bridge 18m above the ground through the thick green tree canopies of the Royal Horticultural Gardens. </p> <p>The architects used the Fibonacci Sequence, the mathematical reflection of natural growth patterns, to determine the structure. Completely original as a concept, this is a fitting (and more rugged) companion to John Pawson's superlative 2006 Sackler Bridge, also at Kew. A little bit like the 1981 Humber Bridge of Pawson's native Yorkshire, the Sackler Bridge connects 'nowt with nowt'. It merely sits as a thing of meditative beauty.</p> <p>So what can new bridges do for us? Trusses and pylons, no matter how imaginatively designed, are not in themselves remedies for urban ills. Castleford may not be translated from dump to destination by a fine new bridge. Equally, Zaha Hadid's voluptuous techno-organic extrusion over the Ebro may be mockingly redundant when its host Expo closes. Then again, maybe not.</p> <p>That bridges inspire philosophers and poets is surely significant. When Rousseau saw the Pont du Gard he was silenced. At the same bridge, Charles Kingsley felt 'simple fear' at its majesty. J A Roebling's Brooklyn Bridge - 'and of the curveship lend a myth to God' - inspired Hart Crane's The Bridge, the weirdest poem in American English. To F D Roosevelt, the story of bridge-building was the story of civilisation itself. Right now, Brooklyn Bridge is hosting one of Olafur Eliasson's waterworks, turning the 1883 masterpiece into a magnet for contemporary art lovers. </p> <p>Wakefield Council is scarcely the equivalent of the Ecole nationale des ponts et chauss\u00e9es, not even its successor, SETRA, the Service d'\u00e9tudes techniques des routes et autoroutes, creators of the Millau Viaduct. To drive across that sublime structure is to realise the life-enhancing qualities of bridge-building: a pedestrian bridge over the Aire at Castleford may not be quite so awe-inspiring as driving through the sky and above the clouds over the Tarn, but it is nonetheless a symbol of optimism and opportunity.</p> <p>France may have the very best bridge in the world while the United States - a culture, perhaps, of quantity more than quality - has, according to statistics issued by the Federal Highway Administration, 589,685 of them. What is certain is that in this country we need some more.

  "<p><strong>The dilemma: </strong> I am a 39-year-old gay man with many positive aspects to my life, yet I long for a relationship and someone with whom to share life's joys. I have a good job, friends and a varied social life, but I can't seem to meet any potential partners. I have joined dating websites and never seem to garner any interest. I am handsome and generous and have so much to offer. I have no desire to hang out in bars or clubs to meet people, but wonder what I can do to find someone. In my younger days I lived 'for the moment', but now I want more. My last relationship ended over four years ago and I have been single since then. Most of my friends are now married and have moved out of London, and although I still see lots of them, our lives have taken different trajectories. I am content and don't for one minute wallow in self-pity as I know I am responsible for my own contentment, but the ability to attract a partner seems to have evaded me. What are your thoughts?</p> <p><strong>Mariella: </strong> Post a photo of Brad Pitt alongside your online sales pitch? Subtly suggest that you have millions tucked away that you are eager to spend? Mention the impossibly large nature of your genitalia? Say you're looking for someone for no-ties exciting and certainly perverted sex? There's no way that selling yourself as a normal human being with average desires and a pleasant lifestyle is going to drum up many takers. Nowadays, no one wants a nice, grounded, decent partner. It doesn't play well in anecdotes for one thing. You can't boast to your friends or sell them to you family? These days we all need a U(nique) S(elling) P(oint) and it's naive to think you can find true love without one. Develop some weird hobby and you'll have partners banging down your door - just look at all those freaks on Big Brother. If there's a long series of someone's for that bunch of weirdos it can't be that hard to find a significant other for little old you, now can it? </p> <p>You're at that difficult point between childhood and adulthood, at a fashionably late age where a bunch of options die out and it's a challenge to replicate them. Where dating was once all about staying up late and finding a companionable body to cling on to until the bleary light of morning, now you can't keep your eyes open long enough to score in a caf\u00e9, let alone a club. I know the feeling, having reached that stage at almost exactly the same age. Where the hell do you go looking for romance when the places you once plied your wares hold little appeal?</p> <p>It's a good time for doing something crazy. At 39 I took off on a six-week working sabbatical to Brazil, then dared myself to appear on stage for a three-week run in a West End theatre, and finished off the year hiking for a good cause with 50 strangers in Nepal. Among this unlikely crowd, I quite literally stumbled on my husband! It's not a recipe and doesn't need to be followed to the letter, but I'm convinced that if I hadn't begun widening my horizons they'd still be defining me instead. </p> <p>I'm not suggesting the internet isn't a good pool to be fishing in, but the trouble with shopping online for boyfriends or handbags is that it doesn't require very much investment from you apart from a few well-chosen lines (or lies) about yourself and/or a credit card number. I truly believe emotional down payments pay dividends. The act of placing yourself in a different or unimagined environment promotes small changes in your psyche that make you more susceptible to the right partner. </p> <p>One of the slight issues I have with your letter is the suggestion that you're up for any takers. I'm sure this isn't true and it shouldn't be. There's nothing less likely to attract Mr Right than the impression that you've been sitting moodily waiting for his arrival. A girlfriend of mine once reluctantly agreed to hook up with a lovesick ex-boyfriend. A few days after this supposed reunion, I popped around to her flat and found him sitting at the kitchen table, head in hands, staring at the floor. Meanwhile, she was out playing soccer in the garden with her godson. 'What's going on?' I asked pointing to the lone ranger in the kitchen. 'I think he's trying to bore me into loving him again,' she said with a shrug and carried on the game. It was not a good tactic and predictably wasn't successful. Sitting at home typing lonely-hearts ads and turning your nose up at the venues that were once your preferred hunting grounds is equally unlikely to reap rewards. </p> <p>Find some new pursuits that give you as much pleasure as your old ones once did. You say your friends are spread far and wide so how about visiting them and doing some crazy things while you're there? Walk the Cornish coastal path, go biking in Scotland, join the John Buchan Society for a literary walk, try a cookery course.

  "<p>Rio Tinto will return fire on BHP Billiton, its hostile suitor, this week when it reports its results, hoping to outshine its fellow mining giant, which announced its figures last week.</p> <p>Analysts predict Rio will increase earnings by about half to $5.3bn for the first half of the year, on the back of the commodities boom. Profits will be boosted by the acquisition of Canadian aluminium maker Alcan, which the company did not own during the same period last year. </p> <p>The Australian miner, led by Tom Albanese, will also publish its six-monthly outlook for commodity prices. It is expected to be cautious about demand, as parts of the developed world face recession and China's phenomenal growth looks set to slow. But, over the longer term, Rio will be bullish on global commodity demand, particularly as developing countries urbanise and require metals for their construction boom.</p> <p>Analysts will scrutinise this week's figures against the performance of BHP, which last week reported profits up by a quarter. The mining industry has benefited from the doubling of most metal prices since 2006. But operating costs have also soared by at least a fifth because there is a global shortage of equipment such as trucks. </p> <p>Rio continues to fight BHP's $130bn hostile takeover bid, made in February. On Friday, Australian regulators said that the proposed merger could restrict the global supply of iron ore; the two companies control over a third of seaborne exports of the commodity.</p>",
  "<p>A day after announcing that it had 'withdrawn' from Georgia, Russian troops continued to occupy large areas of the country yesterday in defiance of international pressure and in breach of a ceasefire deal signed by Moscow. </p> <p>The country's forces were in control of several key areas outside the original conflict zone - including the Black Sea port of Poti and the western town of Senaki. Additionally, troops had established new 'buffer zones' around the breakaway republics of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. </p> <p>The United States, France and Britain have denounced Russia's failure to fully withdraw troops. They say it has blatantly failed to 'comply' with a ceasefire agreement obliging it to pull back to its positions before the conflict started on 7 August. </p> <p>There was compelling evidence yesterday, however, that Russia is planning a long-term occupation of Georgia. The Observer witnessed Russian soldiers digging trenches seven kilometres outside the port of Poti next to the Rioni river and the main highway to Tbilisi. </p> <p>A Russian flag flew above a grassy camp; around 20 soldiers were spread out in trenches and next to an armoured personnel carrier. A crowd of about 1,000 demonstrated in front of them yesterday afternoon, waving Georgian flags and shouting: 'Go home.' </p> <p>'This isn't peacekeeping. This is occupation. Their objective is to blockade Georgia and Georgians,' Fatuna Rubakidze, 29, said. Pointing to the bridge across the river, she said: 'This allows them to stop traffic to Poti. It means they can always blackmail us.' </p> <p>The Russians had taken off their regular army helmets and replaced them with blue peacekeeping ones. Locals flung leaflets at them in Russian with the slogan: 'No to Russian fascism'. The soldiers stood implacably in the afternoon sunshine. Once the crowd left, they took the leaflets away. 'Yesterday they were regular soldiers. Today they are peacekeepers. Whatever they are, we want them to leave our territory,' Fatuna, a police lieutenant, said, clicking a photograph of the soldiers with her mobile phone. </p> <p>The Kremlin's plan now appears clear: to maintain a significant military presence in Georgia, capable of choking the country's economy and shutting down its major trade routes. It also allows Russia the option of a future invasion, should it want one. </p> <p>The deputy head of Russia's general staff, Colonel General Anatoly Nogovitsyn, was unrepentant yesterday. He said Russia would continue to patrol Poti - even though it lies outside any so-called 'security zone'. Russia insists that under a previous agreement it can station 2,600 'peacekeeping' troops beyond the borders of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. </p> <p>'Poti is not in the security zone. But that doesn't mean we will sit behind the fence watching as they drive around in Hummers,' Nogovitsyn said, in sardonic reference to the four US Humvees seized by Russia in Poti last week. The vehicles were used in joint US-Georgian military exercises. </p> <p>The general accused Nato of increasing tensions in the Black Sea. American, Spanish German and Polish ships are all heading to the area, with US ships due to deliver humanitarian aid to Georgia today. This 'did not contribute to the settlement of the situation', he said. </p> <p>Georgia yesterday described Russia's occupation as 'absolutely illegal'. Moscow's failure to leave is deeply embarrassing for French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who brokered the ceasefire deal last weekend with Russia's President Dmitry Medvedev. </p> <p>Georgian officials yesterday took The Observer by helicopter across a landscape of shimmering green pasture and mountain to the steamy port of Poti. Their aim was to show off its destruction by Russian soldiers - and to point out that they were still there. </p> <p>Russian bombers destroyed Poti's naval base, killing five people, on the second day of the war. Yesterday, the gun turret of a sunken vessel stuck out above the turquoise water; nearby a white coastguard boat was listing and sunk. Russian soldiers had ransacked the port's main building, blowing open doors and upturning filing cabinets. One had written on a whiteboard: 'Georgian bitches. Die pederast cocks'. </p> <p>'They turned up in 23 BMP armoured vehicles and took whatever was valuable,' said Reza Managadze, a port employee. 'They didn't even leave us anything to eat.' In a smashed-up medical room lay a portrait of Georgia's pro-US president Mikheil Saakashvili. A Russian soldier had stamped on it. He then added one word: 'Dick'. </p> <p>In the town of Gori, normal life slowly resumed after the withdrawal of Russian forces yesterday. Residents began trickling back; a few shops reopened. But the Russians had not gone far, setting up a new checkpoint about 15km north of the city. Russia says that it intends to have 18 checkpoints on the road to South Ossetia and Abkhazia.</p>",
  "<p>The television series Life on Mars was successful partly because of the detailed picture of the Seventies it drew, complete with the drab streets, flares and record players we associate with that decade. If a series set in 2008 were made 10 years hence, a sweep of the high street might trigger a wave of nostalgia for stores such as Woolworths and Currys. That is because they won't be there come 2009, let alone 2019, if some analysts' predictions come true.</p> <p>Indeed, after a century on the high street, the future of Woolworths has never looked more uncertain; the debate over its prospects was ignited this week by a surprise offer from a consortium that includes Iceland founder Malcolm Walker and Baugur, one of its largest shareholders.</p> <p>The \u00a350m offer for Woolworths' 819 stores would see it broken up, leaving investors with wholesale arm EUK and 2 Entertain, a music and video publishing joint venture with the BBC. The offer was rejected by the board because of conditions attached to stores' debt and pension liabilities, meaning it was effectively being asked to pay for the retail division to be taken off its hands. However, the door is now open, with talks expected to begin in earnest this week.</p> <p>Planet Retail analyst Bryan Roberts is convinced change is coming: 'I struggle to see Woolworths existing in its current form in 18 months' time.' Woolworths chairman Richard North ousted chief executive Trevor Bish-Jones in June, after he failed to rediscover the 'wonder of Woolies' in spite of a six-year stint in the job. But despite Walker's overture, the shares are still worth less than 10p - having lost 70 per cent of their value in the past year - with a negative value attached to a retail business that only makes a profit at Christmas.</p> <p>In recent years, all the cliches have been trotted out to explain Woolworths' poor performance; one particularly damning verdict was: 'If it didn't exist, you wouldn't invent it.' Some analysts argue it no longer has a relevance when teenagers download the latest chart hits, rather than dash out to buy them.</p> <p>Bish-Jones appeared to have tried everything, starting an internet business, adding TVs, laptops, mobile phones and bedlinen to create an almighty pick'n'mix. But profits at the chain dropped to \u00a316m last year on sales of \u00a32.7bn, down from \u00a361.5m the previous year. Recent trading has also been poor, with like-for-like sales down nearly 7 per cent in the six weeks to 26 July.</p> <p>So far, so gloomy. 'The Woolworths business model as it stands is just not sustainable,' continues Roberts. 'It has a lot of big stores it struggles to fill, which chains such as Asda and Wilkinsons could make better use of.' Asda has made it clear that it wants to roll out its homewares chain Asda Living, while Tesco and Argos have both developed new formats.</p> <p>'This should be the time in the economic cycle when Woolworths should be doing very nicely,' says one former director. 'You just have to look at Poundstretcher, Wilkinsons and the discounters - they are all doing well. North has said \"we want to keep the small and medium-sized stores and sell the big ones\". Well, we tried that before and nobody wanted to buy them.</p> <p>'The heart of Woolworths - what the brand means - is great value,' he continues. 'But Woolworths isn't delivering great value. People complain about the stores but that's not really the problem; people don't mind the clutter in discount stores if they think they are getting a bargain.'</p> <p>North has admitted Woolworths is 'hugely challenged on the operational side', but insists it can be made good and that his new chief executive - Steve Johnson, who previously ran Focus DIY - is the man to do it.</p> <p>Woolworths' problems are also a reflection of the decline of the high street, which now accounts for less than 40 per cent of the 1.2 billion sq ft of shop space in the UK, as a growing share of retail spending is hoovered up by shopping centres. The growth of multiples and supermarkets has encroached on the terrain of specialists, with footwear chains, such as Dolcis and Stead &amp; Simpson, among this year's biggest casualties. It is expected to be the turn of the electricals specialist next, with the arrival of American giant BestBuy in 2009 likely to increase pressure on incumbent DSG, which is already struggling to make its PC World and Currys chains work.</p> <p>Set against this is the march of coffee and sandwich chains such as Caffe Nero, Costa Coffee, Pret a Manger and Subway, as well as the spread of charity shops, altering the character of the high street. 'I think you will see less choice of shops,' says David Harper of property firm Harper Dennis Hobbs. 'There is a massive change taking place, with fewer retailers taking space and some of them contracting. I think we will go the American way, where we will start to see shops that are not re-let.'</p> <p>Although official retail figures were better than expected last week, sentiment in the sector remains gloomy, and retailers are using the downturn to give renewed momentum to a long-running rental reform campaign. Retailers want to switch to monthly payments, rather than shelling out three months in advance, which is the system at present. Industry luminaries including Arcadia owner Sir Philip Green and Carpetright chairman Lord Harris have been vocal on the subject.</p> <p>The British Retail Consortium says the current system adds \u00a3145m a year to retailers' costs and argues monthly payments would significantly ease cash-flow pressures, especially for smaller retailers. It is to meet with its counterpart, the British Property Federation, to discuss the matter. However, observers question how easy it will be to push through widespread change as the high street is owned by a myriad of small companies and pension funds, not the big listed property firms, which are already accepting monthly deals and five-year rather than 15-year leases.</p> <p>'We have seen a big expansion of building societies, and then opticians following deregulation, then card shops, mobile phone and coffee shops,' continues Harper. 'We could end up with lots of vacant shops, but then prices come down and people start competing again. Something new always comes along.'</p> <p>So could Walker do for Woolworths, where he started his career as a trainee manager, what he has done for Iceland: seeing off the prospect of a carve-up, as befell previous high street casualties such as Allders, Littlewoods and C&amp;A? The entrepreneur has achieved a remarkable turnaround at Iceland, with underlying sales up 30 per cent in the past three years. Profits increased nearly 40 per cent to \u00a3130m on sales of \u00a31.8bn in the year to March 2008, compared with just \u00a34.5m when he rejoined in 2005, following the Baugur-backed buyout.</p> <p>'Malcolm Walker is a fantastic retailer but he is also a charismatic leader,' says one insider. 'It's like the days when football teams such as Huddersfield beat Manchester United: they win because they are inspired. Who knows what Woolworths could achieve with someone like that leading the troops?'</p> <p>Insiders say the Iceland turnaround is down to Walker's back-to-basics style. He cut the number of ranges in stores, slashed head office jobs and improved pay and conditions to boost morale. Last year, he rewarded managers with a trip to Disneyland Paris. 'People used to say Iceland shouldn't exist and when it was listed, the City couldn't really figure out why it did,' says a source familiar with the consortium. 'But it does exist and it succeeds in competing with Tesco, Asda and all the discounters. Woolworths' problem is that it is too expensive.'</p> <p>Walker is expected to apply the 'Iceland formula' to Woolworths, as, according to one insider, he sees parallels between the two. There is also some low-hanging fruit for him to pick: Woolworths has an expensive head office on prime London real estate next to the Landmark Hotel in Marylebone. Critics also point to bloated buying teams that are supplemented by a sourcing office in the Far East. There is also the expectation the retailer will quit retailing in areas such as mobile phones and electricals to concentrate on its strengths, which include homewares, toys and children's clothing. The future of its home shopping arm, the Big Red Book, is already under review.</p> <p>'When we asked customers, they always said they wanted Woolworths to succeed: people love Woolies,' says a former director. So customers love it and now Walker wants it; perhaps Woolworths does have a future on the high street. But at what price?</p> <h2>Victims of the retail wars</h2> <p>High streets can be mean streets and not every brand stands the test of time. The start of the new millennium marked the end for C&amp;A. The retailer pulled out of the UK in 2000, capping a 75-year run on the high street.</p> <p>Its Yessica and Clockhouse brands helped teenage girls look a state during the New Romantic Eighties and well into the early Nineties, but the nation, or that part of it, was shocked when C&amp;A's secretive Dutch owners, the Brenninkmeyer family, pulled the plug on all 113 stores and nearly 5,000 jobs after they racked up \u00a3250m worth of losses in the preceding five years.</p> <p>Shoppers often feel a sense of ownership when it comes to their chains \u2013 the M&amp;S faithful are among the biggest diehards out there. And who can forget Littlewoods, Allders or Army &amp; Navy Stores? Well, customers, apparently, who all now happily shop in the Primark, New Look and Debenhams stores that replaced them. What Every Woman Wants? Turned out she didn't. And she didn't want Etam, Pilot or Salisbury either.</p> <p>Who picked up their mum's messages from Fine Fare, William Low or even Safeway, or walked home clutching a record from Our Price or Virgin Megastores? All names consigned to the retail graveyard, along with shoe chain Freeman, Hardy and Willis, which once had a foothold in nearly every town in the UK. At the end of the day, it would seem, retail love is fleeting.</p> <h2>Icy determination: Malcolm Walker</h2> <p>Whether it's putting in a cheeky offer for Woolworths or making a cameo in Coronation Street, there is no question that Iceland founder Malcolm Walker is one of Britain's most colourful entrepreneurs.</p> <p>He set out to make his fortune in 1970 selling strawberries at a beauty spot. Then, moonlighting from his day job as a trainee store manager at Woolworths, he opened the first Iceland store in Oswestry, Shropshire. He was fired from Woolworths but its loss was frozen food's gain. In the Seventies, Iceland was being run from a terraced house in Rhyl. By 1984, it had established its Deeside base and floated on the Stock Exchange. The retailer thrived during the Nineties, capping the millennium with the acquisition of cash-and-carry chain Booker, a major deal after which Walker took a step back. Bill Grimsey, fresh from leading the turnaround of Focus DIY, and his partner Bill Hoskins took over the enlarged business, renamed the Big Food Group (BFG). They set about restructuring the business and Walker was forced to leave under a cloud because of a share-dealing controversy: the company reported catastrophic sales figures several weeks after Walker, the executive chairman, had sold \u00a313.5m worth of stock. The Serious Fraud Office cleared him of any wrongdoing.</p> <p>The fall from grace was terrible for Walker, who is married with three children and lives in Chester. And it would be fair to say this is a grudge the Greenpeace member won't let go. He even set up chain Cooltrader in competition.</p> <p>In 2005, BFG investors were put out of their misery when the group - which owned Iceland, Booker and Woodward Foodservice - was sold to Baugur for \u00a3326m and broken up; Walker, now 62, was invited to return. The deal has been a coup for Baugur, delivering estimated returns of more than \u00a31bn, thanks in no small part to Walker's passion for the business he built, lost, then found again.</p>",
  "<p>London takes possession of the Olympic flag today, hoping that a newfound belief in British sport and an old-style rock legend can help it to live up to the awe-inspiring spectacle of the Beijing Games.</p> <p>Members of the nation's most successful team in a hundred years will join Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page for the closing handover ceremony in the Bird's Nest Stadium tonight, where London will try to make up in warmth and humour what it cannot match in scale and ambition.</p> <p>Thanks to the performances in the velodrome, in the pool, the sea and on the track, the mood is already one of celebration. It went all the way to the top yesterday when the Queen offered her congratulations to the British team. 'Like so many people around the world, I have followed their endeavours with great interest and admiration,' she said. 'To all the participants, and to everyone who has supported them so well, I send my warmest congratulations. As a nation we now look forward to holding the Olympic Games in London in 2012. The golden triumphs of the present British team can only serve as further inspiration to those who will be working hard over the next four years to make the London Games a shining example of Olympic success.'</p> <p>Gordon Brown added his own tribute and triggered potential pub debates by calling for a combined UK football team to compete in 2012. Britain has not entered a football side in the Olympics since 1960, partly because of fears it could jeopardise the separate England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland national sides. But the Prime Minister told Sky News: 'I hope there will be a team by 2012. It will be Team UK. I think when people are looking at the Olympics in 2012 - Britain, home of football, where football was invented, which we gave to the world - I think people would be very surprised if there is an Olympic tournament in football and we are not part of it.'</p> <p>In the meantime there was individual glory for Britain yesterday when boxer James DeGale won the men's middleweight title. The 22-year-old Londoner survived a frantic late assault by Cuban Emilio Correa to claim the gold medal at the Workers' Stadium. DeGale sank to his knees at the final bell then showboated with the Union Jack draped around his shoulders, relishing the boos of the Chinese crowd who had backed the Cuban to win. It took the British tally of gold medals to 19.</p> <p>Britain nevertheless slipped behind Russia to fourth in the medal table. That this is now almost a disappointment shows how far expectations have surged after the week of success that induced shock, disbelief and giddy delight in a nation that has grown morbidly used to sporting failure.</p> <p>Ahead of these Games, Olympic planners targeted eighth place. Many commentators thought they were being wildly over-optimistic. But going into the final day, Britain is behind only the world's biggest population, China, the planet's most powerful economy, the US, and Russia, a sporting giant for much of the past 50 years.</p> <p>With the best gold medal haul in a century, the count continued to tick upwards yesterday when Sarah Stevenson won bronze in the +67 taekwondo after a day of drama. She had earlier successfully over-turned the 'blatant robbery' of her quarter-final defeat to world number one Zhong Chen. The flustered 25-year-old then lost her semi-final but bounced back strongly to defeat Egyptian Nowa Abd Rabo 5-1 in the bronze medal match. Stevenson, nursing a twisted ankle, became Britain's first ever Olympic taekwondo medalist. Kayaker Tim Brabants took bronze in the final of the 500m men's K1 race, missing out on his second gold in two days by just four-tenths of a second in a close finish between the top three.</p> <p>But the real story of this Games is the rise of China. From the 2,000 synchronised drummers in the mind-boggling opening ceremony to what will effectively be its enthronement as the new King of the Olympics at the close tomorrow, the host has exuded power at every turn.</p> <p>For the first time, China will top the medal table, probably with more than 50 golds. Its domination of target sports has been total: topping the podium 11 times in gymnastics, eight in weightlifting, five in shooting. Yesterday, China wrapped up all four table-tennis golds.</p> <p>The US has lagged far behind, falling into second place in terms of golds for the first time since the break-up of the Soviet Union. At a time when China's economy is surging, while America is stuck in its worst slump in decades, the Olympic table is seen by many as a harbinger of a shift in the balance of power.</p> <p>That American athletes picked up more medals overall will be some consolation on the other side of the Pacific, but the rest of the world will take note that the superpower has been eclipsed by China as a nation of winners. How this was achieved is likely to come under intense scrutiny. For those seeking Cold War-style comparisons, swimmer Michael Phelps - who broke Mark Spitz's 36-year-old record with eight golds in one Games - was a triumph of US individualism, while the Chinese team remains a product of a Soviet-inspired system of 3,000 state sports schools that recruit and drill children from as young as six, and often in sports that they had never previously heard of. The 110m hurdler, Liu Xiang, was the best counter to such claims, but he bowed out with injury before crossing a single hurdle in the biggest disappointment of the Games for the home audience.</p> <p>Beijing has been a superb Games with 38 world record performances so far, including seven by Phelps and three by the world's fastest man, Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt. But it was always going to be about more than sport, with the world's leaders in attendance to witness China's return to the world centre stage. Despite the disastrous torch relay, the communist government will consider these two weeks a propaganda coup worth every penny of \u00a322bn.</p> <p>The sight of George Bush goofing around at the basketball arena will have been an added bonus, outweighing the lame-duck President's constant calls in Beijing for more freedom of religion and speech. Most of the criticism directed at China ahead of the Games focused on the environment and human rights concerns. After a hazy start, the first was assuaged by a combination of wind, rain and impressive efforts to reduce pollution by restricting traffic, closing factories and improving public transport. </p> <p>The latter worry was brushed under the carpet more ruthlessly. Several critics of the government and the Olympics, such as Hu Jia and Liu Jie, were sent to prison or re-education through labour camps ahead of the Games. Others were closely watched by police or warned not to speak to foreign journalists. Petitioners were driven out of the city, along with countless migrant workers. </p> <p>The social cleansing campaign included many Tibetans and Uighurs - both minority groups from restive regions of China - who were heavily restricted. The government's hope to use the Games to present an image of ethnic harmony was undercut by the worst upsurge of violence in Xinjiang in more than a decade, and revelations that the happy, smiling 'minority children' at the opening ceremony were actually all from the Han majority.</p> <p>As well as changing China, the organisers hoped the Olympics would change perceptions of the country in the outside world. This Games will have impressed them with the scale and speed of change in China, with its modernity, with the improved living standards of its people. But the government's inability to overcome a fear of criticism and instability meant that this Olympics struggled to engender a mood of warmth and fun.</p> <p>By contrast, London's Olympic organisers hope this will be their main selling point. The UK cannot compete on cost. Instead it will try to generate more of a party atmosphere at a street level and in the Olympic park where giant screens will be set up, unlike in Beijing.</p> <p>Olympics Minister Tessa Jowell told The Observer that crowds in China erupted with joy when cheering their own team in the stadiums, but that people were more reserved on the streets. 'London will be different,' she said. 'The London Games will be the joyous Games. There will be a great sense of partying, of festivity. The streets of London will be alive during the Games.'</p> <p>To press the message home, Jimmy Page has been recruited to rock London's eight-minute segment of the closing ceremony with Led Zeppelin's 'Whole Lotta Love'. He will drive around the track with David Beckham, Leona Lewis and the National Youth Orchestra in red double decker bus No 2012.</p> <p>Cynics are already preparing their cringes. But the Olympic sportsmen have proved them wrong once. The London organisers will hope to do so again as Boris Johnson takes the Olympic flag and the countdown to 2012 begins.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Click <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics/2008/medals/full\">here</a> for the full medal table.</p>",
  "<p>The Westminster village has emptied of MPs bar a few workaholics. The assumption is that the voters are all enjoying sun, sangria and sex on the Costa del Sol, so politics can have a month (and a bit) off, before the frenzy of political activity in September at our conferences.</p> <p>The problem with the politicians' theory of August is that it isn't true - most people are still here. The trains are full and London is thronged with people, many of whom actually speak English. There is certainly enough of an audience to keep me busy in the media studios, bombarding the public with punditry on inflation, unemployment, energy prices, the credit crunch and housing. </p> <p>The uncomfortable truth is that the cost of living is rising, as is unemployment, while house prices are falling. These trends haven't stopped because the hacks and politicos are away. I'm an optimist, but having been proved broadly right about the weaknesses and trajectory of the British economy I seem to have established a niche as Dr Doom.</p> <p>Even the economic gloom has had to take second place to Gabby Logan and the Olympics. I have become a couch patriot, cheering on our boys and girls. I confess to being fascinated by the wrong things: the extraordinarily ugly people with enormous beer bellies who lift staggering weights and the tiny tots whose remarkable agility in the gym is matched only by their ability to persuade credulous officials that they are 16. </p> <p>I struggle to understand sailing and the Madison and why a festival of sport that includes BMX biking, clay pigeon shooting and beach volleyball doesn't include serious sports such as rugby and cricket, not to mention snooker and darts. </p> <p>As a politician, my main contribution to the Olympic movement has been as one of the whingeing, carping killjoys who questions why billions of British tax payers' money should be spent bringing this jamboree to London. </p> <p>But I share the feeling of pride that the fraying UK is genuinely united in this celebration. For me, the super heroes were Rebecca, the never-say-die swimmer from Mansfield, and Christine, the shy British Nigerian from Stratford who combined serious training with a linguistics thesis on the etymology of swearwords.</p> <p>After the exertions of the couch and the TV studios, I managed to get a couple of days on my wife Rachel's small farm in the New Forest, a haven of contentment and peace. This is the only place I am ever likely to settle to the task of writing a book on the world economic crisis which I recklessly volunteered before the summer. As an urban and suburban man, I have discovered, late in life, the sounds of bird song and wind in the trees and grass and the simple pleasures of walking in fields and woods among deer, horses and cattle. </p> <p>As I struggle to get my head round collateralised debt obligations, peak oil theory and the real, effective dollar exchange rate, it is an occasional relief to be summoned from my work to admire the bull's testicles and look for signs of his nocturnal activities with a rather unattractive young lady with flies on her nose. Somehow, a new chapter of the book is completed.</p> <p>From there to the nearest thing my Twickenham constituency has to agriculture - allotments - awarding prizes at an open day. There has been a quiet revolution in recent years as jungle has been cleared by dozens of local families wanting to grow their own fruit and vegetables. Although my knowledge of biology can be written on half a side of A4 paper, I seem to have become an expert on nature: I'm passionately for bees and against contaminated manure. My speech in the rain got more rapt attention than it deserved.</p> <p>Other constituency duties included a charity cricket match in support of autistic children. I still harbour fantasies of being the undiscovered heir to Fred Trueman. But my first over was a nightmare: two, head-high full tosses, one ball which dropped behind the bowler's wicket and the other three dispatched to the boundary. Batting was marginally better; a perfectly executed forward defensive stroke, modelled on Geoffrey Boycott, even though the ball had already bounced several times, and various deft glances and cuts scored off gentle dolly drops brought me three runs. Still, a good cause.</p> <p>The weekly advice surgery brought a crop of horror stories which remind me of the pressures which many of my constituents face. One distraught lady is trying to cope with a \u00a3100,000 bill after her crucially ill husband was parked, against her will, in an extremely expensive private hospital after falling ill while abroad. He remains in a coma. The insurance company refuses to pay up. I trust my threats of parliamentary exposure and the Daily Mail will shame them where polite requests have failed.</p> <p>Two young mums in overcrowded rented flats - they want to work but will lose their housing benefit if they do; no chance of a council house; a brood of teenage tearaways in the making. Then there is a tearful, love-struck mother of two whose hubby is in prison awaiting deportation. Yes, he did bad things years ago; now he is a reformed character.

  "<p>Plenty of charitable credit card users who use an 'affinity' - or charity - card for buying goods will soon be looking for a new beneficiary after the imminent closure of Nationwide's fundraising credit card for Comic Relief. </p> <p>The special card - which, like all such plastic, donates a percentage of purchases to charitable causes - comes to the end of its life in just a few days as Nationwide's contract with the charity ends, and the building society is not offering any other means of donating through card purchases, having chosen instead to donate directly to charities. </p> <p>While Nationwide stresses that affinity cards are just one of many ways in which to give to charity, Steve Willey from price comparison website <a href=\"http://www.Moneysupermarket.com\">Moneysupermarket.com</a> says the overall number of affinity cards available 'has declined significantly, partly because the card providers rarely make money on them'. They may offer good brand association, he goes on, 'but they only appeal to a very niche market'.</p> <p>Critics of affinity cards, too, believe that those in this niche market would be wiser to give straight to charity. Although they encourage all forms of giving, the Charities Aid Foundation says the best return for charities comes from direct donations, not cards, because the Gift Aid scheme enables them to claw back an extra 25p in the pound from the Revenue. </p> <p>Charities typically receive around 25p for every \u00a3100 spent on an affinity card, with bonus donations when a card is used for the first time ranging from \u00a35 to \u00a350. This means that consumers will usually need to spend several thousand pounds for their donation to reach double figures. And they aren't a comfortable source of credit either. 'Affinity cards aren't the best products out there for purchases,' adds Willey. 'Their typical APR is 15.9 to 16.9 per cent'. This is steep compared with the 0 per cent deals available elsewhere, and low-rate cards such as the Barclaycard Simplicity bearing an APR of only 6.8 per cent.</p> <p>But charities do receive a significant income from these cards. The British Heart Foundation's affinity card has raised more than \u00a31.2m from around 50,000 cardholders. 'Our research has shown that many people do not support charities because they don't feel they have the time,' says the foundation's Harriet Pearce. 'Our credit card allows people to donate in a way that's convenient to them - for example, when they're at the checkout.' Meanwhile, Oxfam is thrilled with the \u00a33.5m raised by its affinity card, offered by the Co-operative Bank, which it says has been raised 'by people just making their everyday purchases'.</p> <p>A better option would arguably be to take on a cashback credit card, which pays back a small percentage of money on each purchase, and donate the proceeds. The best cashback card on the market is the American Express Platinum, which offers 5 per cent cashback on purchases for the first three months and up to 1.5 per cent thereafter. This means that for every \u00a3100 spent, you could donate \u00a35. But, as Andrew Bond from Barclaycard points out, 'setting up a cashback card and donating the money earned may require a level of motivation you'll only find in very committed supporters'.</p> <p>You should also avoid cashback cards if you do not pay back the balance in full on your cards every month; interest paid wipes out the benefit.</p> <p>If you habitually owe money on your credit account but are determined to use a charity card, many of them run an introductory offer of 0 per cent interest on purchases for the first three to six months. Keep an eye out for offers on balance transfers as well because a number of cards offer 0 per cent interest for 12 months. And if you don't have a strong preference for which charity to back, choose a card that offers high rewards. The American Express Red card donates 1 per cent of all purchases to The Global Fund's work with women and children affected by HIV in Africa, by far the highest such donation.</p>",
  "<p>Rosie Boycott has a habit of reinventing herself roughly once a decade. She was a leading feminist in the 1970s, wrote a revealing memoir in the 1980s and edited a glossy magazine and a New Labour-leaning newspaper in the 1990s. Her various incarnations have always been remarkably in tune with the temper of the times, so the latest one is looking rather worrying.</p> <p>Last month, Boycott wrote an article for the Daily Mail suggesting that women who have babies damage the finances of small businesses. The clear implication was that it is risky to employ females of childbearing age. In a similar piece elsewhere, a couple of months previously, she'd fretted that feminism is 'turning out to be not a dream come true but a nightmare'. In another article, this time in the Guardian, she seemed to recant her former hostility to domestic work and suggest women should all get back to the kitchen. </p> <p>I travelled down to her house in Somerset (she also has a house in Notting Hill) to try to find out what on earth is going on. Is Boycott turning into a living warning against being too radical in youth for fear of becoming too conservative when you get older? Is she some kind of spooky Zelig figure who can't help reflecting back the prevailing politics, providing a bellwether of the coming new conservative order? </p> <p>I've known Rosie Boycott on and off (although not well) since the 1980s, but when I visited her this week I hadn't seen her for years. The first thing I noticed is that at 57, and several years after a serious car accident that left her leg and foot permanently damaged, she is as irrepressibly energetic as ever. She has a tangle of blonde hair, a husky voice from a lifetime of smoking, and apparently endless enthusiasm. She is passionate about her causes and you would have to be rather a cold fish not to find her engaging.</p> <p>Her circumstances, on the other hand, have altered quite a lot since we last met. Then she was a newspaper editor, whisking about London, glitzing about in literary and political circles. Now she is hanging over the gate of a house in a valley in jeans and a checked shirt.</p> <p>She walks me round the garden and through the storybook-style woodland she created during her convalescence from her accident. She was drunk at the time of the crash, driving on the A303 between her homes in Somerset and London. In her late twenties she was an alcoholic, and wrote a funny and fiercely honest book about it, A Nice Girl Like Me (Amy Jenkins has recently done a screenplay; the memoir itself is being reissued next year). But she hadn't drunk for years, until she lost her job as editor of the Daily Express and realised, she says, that she'd been almost entirely externally defined, by her job. 'I had no sense of myself beyond that.'</p> <p>We sit and talk in the conservatory overlooking magnificent herbaceous borders, among the basil plants that her husband, Charlie Howard QC, will later turn into pesto for our lunch. Localism and the countryside, we are always being told, will be important themes for Cameron's Tories. And here's Rosie Boycott, living in the country, growing her own vegetables, picking her basil five minutes before it's on the plate, selling her eggs at nearby markets and writing a book, (Spotted Pigs and Green Tomatoes) extolling the joys of running a smallholding. Coincidence, or what?</p> <p>Now we learn that on 13 September Boycott will start work with Boris as the mayor's 'food tsar' (technically, she will be Chair of London Food). She is fanatical about this, believing that food is far more important than fuel and has the potential to do a whole range of things, from kick-starting environmental activism to solving social problems. She claims she can't say much about the job yet, but she doesn't really want to talk about anything else and keeps saying things like: 'I plan to green every single space in London I can, every roof I can, creating vegetable gardens, filling empty spaces.' </p> <p>Before we get on to that, though, I want to get to the bottom of her apparent reservations about the legacy of feminism. In her Daily Mail article, she objected that: 'While parental rights are a wonderful thing in theory, beloved by governments eager to court the \"family-friendly\" vote, they are an immense burden on the small businesses who are expected to pick up the tab.' On her smallholding, she went on, she employs an 'incredibly attractive' young woman in her thirties called Sarah, whose possible pregnancy she dreads.</p> <p>The subtext here seems to be that young women are inevitably going to get knocked up, especially if attractive. If you're a hard-pressed steward of the land, you employ them at your peril. When I visited, Sarah, happily, had so far avoided getting pregnant. But Boycott claimed her employee hadn't minded being publicly warned about the damaging possibilities of her childbearing decisions - 'She's lovely.'</p> <p>It does seem odd, though, that Boycott, who founded the pioneering feminist magazine Spare Rib in 1972, at the age of 21, appears to be prioritising the needs of business over the rights of women to choose how much time to take off paid work. And it seems - how shall we say? - rather unfair of her to have argued for reproductive rights when she was of the age to reproduce, and for small business now that's become her new baby. (In fact, she may have been unnecessarily fearful. She seems surprised when I tell her that employers can recover 92 per cent of the 26 weeks' statutory maternity pay.)</p> <p>Whatever, Boycott claims she has been misunderstood. She insists that what she was actually saying is that women are facing pressures caused by inequality. 'What message are we sending out that a man's got entitlement to two weeks' paternity leave and a woman's got 52?' </p> <p>But wouldn't longer paternity leave just exacerbate the problems for small businesses? 'We are going to need better tax breaks for small businesses. I don't think there's enough help. But I don't know how we do the next step of feminism. I think when we started out we assumed women would have choices. Being a parent has been downgraded. If I could go back I would have started fighting much sooner for tax relief for childcare.'</p> <p>For what it's worth, I think this is an example of why Rosie Boycott is such a brilliant campaigner. She makes lots of points, irrespective of whether some of them, in some respects, contradict others. Those of us who sit round worrying about the subtle implications of arguing x at the same time as y will probably never change anything. Boycott comes storming at you, and the effect is that you're knocked sideways by her belief and the cumulative force of her arguments.</p> <p>Great campaigners tend to attract campaigns to them, or to gravitate towards them. Aside from her championing of feminism, Boycott ran what was arguably the highest-profile newspaper campaign of recent times when she was at the Independent on Sunday, to legalise cannabis. Now, she says, she is 'more in favour than ever of legalising all drugs'. As a trustee of the Hay Festival, she is responsible for exporting its activities to Colombia, and she has seen for herself the devastation caused there 'by the world's illegal drugs policy and the West's greed for cocaine'.</p> <p>She promises, though, that her current overriding passion, her food and environment campaign, will be her last. 'This one is not going to go away in my lifetime. On the other hand, I do think we're at a tipping point, like when I started Spare Rib in the early Seventies. Then we were pushing at a totally open door. No one you went to could stand in your way. I feel the same now about the environment and gardening. We have lost connection with the land and growing, and that has made people feel impotent. </p> <p>'My generation has had it easy. My entire life has been created by cheap oil and that has given us an extraordinary amount of choice. But all this convenience only seems to have made us more neurotic and isolated. There is a feeling that we have become less resilient. The mood is now swinging back in the opposite direction. People are recognising that food is the great binder.' </p> <p>She reminds me that when Monty Don created a smallholding with a group of offenders and addicts, he discovered that many of them had never eaten a meal round a table with other people. And she talks about the cohesiveness of societies in southern Europe, their ability to share childcare across the generations, which she sees as linked to a respect for food and the rituals of eating together. </p> <p>I am sure she's right about this, though it does seem a peculiar position for a person who once urged women not to learn either to type or cook. Domesticity was seen by the Spare Ribbers as shackling women. Boycott's own university-educated mother had chafed all her life against the restrictions of being an army housewife, reacting mulishly by serving a lot of fishfingers with ketchup. The Spare Rib women were determined to make their own lives different. Early on in the magazine's life they gave away a purple dishcloth printed with the words: 'First you sink into his arms, then your arms end up in his sink.'</p> <p>As things turned out, all of us, men included, have had to learn to type, and most of us have discovered that if we like eating and conviviality and feeding our children, someone in the household has to care about cooking. Boycott now agrees cheerfully that 'don't type, don't cook' was 'crap advice'. And it was, but also it wasn't, because cooking takes time, and there's no reason why women should always and inevitably be the ones to find it. And, although it's difficult to pin her down about this, one suspects if she had her child rearing/ newspaper editing years again, she would not have spent much more of them in the kitchen.</p> <p>Boycott has a daughter, Daisy, now 25, from her first marriage to the journalist David Leitch. (She also has two older stepchildren from that marriage, and two adult stepchildren from her marriage, in 1999, to Charlie). She split up with Leitch, another heavy drinker, in 1989; he died 15 years later. As a single parent, she had no choice but to work, but she did not, perhaps, have to do so as obsessively as she did. She admits she got over her addiction to drugs and drink largely by being a workaholic.</p> <p>'I wish I had seen more of my daughter. One of the great lies we working parents tell ourselves is that we get home about the time that they get home from school. But it's not true. I feel sad about it. I wish there hadn't been so much seductive pressure. But the truth is I loved work. In the 1990s I was having the best time of my life.'</p> <p>Boycott has edited three newspapers in total (the Independent on Sunday, Independent and Express) and, in the process, she put down an important marker: this is a job women are capable of doing, and a woman has as much right as a man to decide, as she did, that 'running a newspaper is about as thrilling as it gets'.</p> <p>Life is messier than campaigners and trailblazers might like to think, though. Almost inevitably, now that she's immersed in it, she's more aware of the value of domesticity. 'I'm not saying that people not eating meals together is the cause of all social ills, but if you eat meals together, you talk to each other. If you don't sit round a table, you stop having a heart to things. I know it sounds very Cameroonian, and I suppose it is. Which is not to say I've become a Tory, so don't say I have! Food has no politics. Carbon has no politics.'</p> <p>The new job at City Hall came up after Guto Harri, the Mayor's communications director, heard Boycott speaking at Hay. 'I am very interested in how we feed people in cities, and the vulnerability of cities. If for some reason all those lorries you see circling the M25 couldn't deliver food into London, it would be a complete disaster within 72 hours. We are, as someone said, nine meals from anarchy.' She wants to get Londoners thinking about food and about how long we want to cede responsibility for all that to multinationals.</p> <p>She has a 'green grid plan' to create allotment gardens in hospitals, prisons, schools and vacant lots. There is, she says, 'an army already there, lots of incredibly interesting small projects - like What-if, who grow plants in builder's bags and install them in neglected spaces, or the Women's Environmental Network, who have created gardens on housing estates in Tower Hamlets so that ethnic minority women can grow their own food. And it's interesting how many people with money seem keen to invest in this kind of thing. Everybody wants to feel on the side of the angels. My job will be to raise the money for these groups and then say \"go\".'</p> <p>Of course, you could spend ages dissecting the contradictions inherent in Rosie Boycott's positions. She has been a feminist and the highly successful editor of a men's glossy; an addict and a mother; a small businesswoman and a campaigner for women's rights in the workplace. By her own admission, she is both enormously privileged and an old hippy. She has an urban life and a country life. It doesn't always all add up.</p> <p>But that would be to miss the point of her. Boycott is an idealist, effervescent and forceful. Her willingness to live out her life in the public eye may have been exposing, but it has also made her effective. Oh, and she's right: the more allotments the better.</p> <h2>Boycott's own story</h2> <p><strong>1951 </strong>Born in St Helier, Jersey.

  "<p>One can only speculate on the fashion footprint of the wardrobes of Lord Howie of Troon and the Earl of Northesk, both members of the Lords science and technology committee, but you'd have to suspect it is minimal. Given each lord's age, gender and peer-group interests - the highest fashion consumption rates are for women in their early thirties who read glossy magazines - the peers' share will come in well below the average of 35kg of textiles per person per year (mostly clothing). Much of this will be thrown out within a year; a small part will be recycled or donated to charity, and the rest will be chucked in the bin.</p> <p>Last week's waste reduction report from the Lords committee read a little in places like an analysis of the woodland defecation procedures of bears. '[The] culture of \"fast fashion\" encourages consumers to dispose of clothes which have only been worn a few times in favour of new, cheap garments which themselves will also go out of fashion and be discarded within a matter of months,' announced the venerable lords in tones of shock and awe. </p> <p>Many women are inured to the obscene excesses of fast fashion. One pound in four is now spent on 'value' fashion as provided by the likes of Primark, Asda and Topshop, which has had huge success with model Kate Moss's range of clothes. Between 2003 and 2007 garment prices fell by an average of 10 per cent and over the past five years the rate of frenzied buying has accelerated, while we make room for it by discarding some two million tons every year.</p> <p>The true weight of this addiction has only really been felt by an unfortunate few such as the Salvation Army which, with around 2,750 of the UK's 9,000 charity clothing banks, has been faced with an ever growing mound of tat to flog to consumers indifferent to pre-worn unless it happens to be vintage. Value fashion retailers will debate forever as to how they can sell clothes so cheaply, usually citing economies of scale, but it has been clear to recyclers for some time that a fall in fibre quality and finishing is part of the equation. This makes the resale of last season's paper thin, slightly shrunken sun dress a distinctly unappetising commercial proposition. Besides, there isn't much incentive for consumers to buy worn when a new dress costs less than a lunchtime panini and coffee.</p> <p>The bulk of discarded fast fashion is chucked into landfill. Meanwhile, the fashion industry has been particularly adept at avoiding green censure and criticism. While more prosaic sectors - food and drink, electronics, detergents and even car manufacturers -</p> <p>have been forced to own up to environmental shortcomings either to pre-empt legislation or conform to new regulations (such as the EU directive that means your hairdryer or washing machine can no longer be flung into landfill) fashion appears to have charmed us all in a haze of sequins, air kisses and the seemingly boundless dynamism of fast fashion with its high street empires and super-rich moguls.</p> <p>But when Defra, the department for the environment, began to analyse the impact of different materials in the nation's landfills a couple of years ago, fast fashion's get-out-of-jail-free card was unexpectedly revoked. The nation's penchant for 'McFashion' - as one-night-only T-shirts and skinny jeans have been dubbed - was found to translate into more than three million tons of carbon dioxide emissions. </p> <p>More significant to millions of fashion-lovers than the opinions of a Lords committee or Defra will be the opinion of the style press. And even those who formerly and gleefully proclaimed Primark the new Prada are now suggesting that fast fashion has rather had its day. Apparently it is all about 'investment dressing' - buying one piece and loving it for a long time - now as fashionistas tighten their tiny little belts. 'Gucci or gas?' asks the September issue of Harper's Bazaar, advising fashion-lovers feeling the credit crunch to survive on 'one big ticket item, something in between or a little bit of both'. </p> <p>There's some validity in this argument, as anything that cuts down the rapid turnover begins to reverse the fact that - according to Matilda Lee from the Ecologist - just 2 per cent of the average clothing budget goes on services that repair or lengthen the lifespan of our garments and accessories.</p> <p>However, to be truly sustainable, the fashion parameters will have to be widened. If fashion is about ingenuity and innovation, this is a good time for the industry to draw on these qualities and return to measuring fashion in terms of something other than quantity. There has already been a shift. Phil Patterson, once textiles manager at Marks and Spencer, has set up <a href=\"http://www.ecotextile.com\">ecotextile.com</a> to allow consumers to assess their wardrobe in terms of environmental damage units (EDUs) with the goal that they'll be more fibre-discerning in future. The London College of Fashion recently launched its Centre for Sustainable Fashion and there has been a renaissance of thrift fashion ideas from reworking existing pieces to sewing classes, kit fashion, clothes swaps and clothes and accessory libraries. </p> <p>There would appear to be some ethical motivation for change too. In the aftermath of the Observer and Panorama expos\u00e9 of child labour used in manufacturing a line for Primark, an ICM research poll, commissioned by Drapers magazine, found that 42 per cent of people who shop at Primark were less likely or a lot less likely to shop at the retailer because of what they had heard. </p> <p>In reality, any demise of super-cheap, super-fast fashion probably comes down to market economics. Labour costs have increased 50 per cent in the past four years across provinces in south-eastern China, the sewing room of the world. Meanwhile, fast fashion is scarily dependent on cheap fibres, namely polyester and cotton - which together account for more than 80 per cent of all fibre production worldwide.</p> <p>Both are dogged by sustainability issues. As petroleum production declines, polyester prices are soaring, while cotton's insatiable need for water (and agrichemicals), coupled with the fact that two-thirds is still rain-grown in areas where rainfall has declined, means there's not enough to go around. Add to this a new, hungry consumer in the form of the Chuppie (the Chinese yuppie) who has developed an appetite for fast fashion herself, meaning that Chinese producers are less eager to export. </p> <p>It will almost certainly get slower. In order to keep up with the trend for two new lines a week, brought to the high street by Spanish fashion giant Zara, competitors are increasingly reliant on air freight, and that is becoming hugely expensive. </p> <p>Shipping a standard container from Shanghai to America's east coast costs $8,000 (\u00a34,315) today, as opposed to just $3,000 a few months ago. Container ships are slowing down to cut fuel costs. If fashion stays fast it will need to become more localised, which will increase cost. So it can be slow and cheap, or fast and expensive. It is the combination of cheap and fast that is unsustainable. </p> <p>In any case, we shouldn't overly mourn the passing of cheap fast fashion. We may be short on cheap fibre and oil, but one thing we have an abundance of is creativity. The demise of fast fashion could be as revolutionary as the mini skirt, the Ugg boot and Agyness Deyn all rolled into one.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Lucy Siegle is the Observer's Ethical Living columnist and Visiting Professor at the London College of Fashion</p>",
  "<p>Some of Britain's most famous coastal landmarks will be radically changed or even lost because it is no longer possible to hold back rising seas and coastal erosion, according to the National Trust.</p> <p>The castle of St Michael's Mount off the coast of Cornwall, the white cliffs of Birling Gap in East Sussex, Studland beach in Dorset and the dunes of Formby, near Liverpool, are among the places which could alter dramatically. In one of the most extreme cases to be identified by the trust, the entire 18th-century fishing village of Porthdinllaen on the north-west coast of Wales could be left to crumble into the sea.</p> <p>The report on the 10 coastal hotspots will be published this week to highlight the problems of climate change which threaten about 70 sites around the coastline owned by the trust.</p> <p>Phil Dyke, the National Trust's coast and marine adviser, said the decision to stop protecting many coastal areas was driven by the rising cost of damage, because global warming is causing more sea-level rises and more intense storms which exacerbate erosion, and because protection measures often cause damage farther along the coast, for example, depriving nearby beaches of shingle and sand. On one site in Cornwall the trust estimated it would cost \u00a36m to build defences which would only last about 25 years.</p> <p>The report highlights the difficult decisions which will have to be taken across Britain and around the world as landowners and governments decide how to cope with the impact of climate change on habitats and built infrastructure, particularly after a tradition of pitting engineers against natural change.</p> <p>'Over the next 100 years the shape of our coastline will change, and our favourite seaside destinations may not look the way they were captured in our holiday snapshots,' said Dyke. 'I think we have a natural affinity with our coast and the sea. But we all need to be aware that our environment is not fixed and that change is inevitable.'</p> <p>Three years ago a separate report by the National Trust warned that more than half the charity's coastline was under threat and up to 10,000 acres could be lost to the sea in the next century, but the full impact of the problem had not been fully appreciated.</p> <p>The 10 case studies in the report include three residential areas: at Birling Gap in Sussex one cottage has already been demolished and the remaining four will eventually be lost as the soft chalk cliffs erode by a metre a year; residents on St Michael's Mount, near Penzance, could lose their low-tide causeway permanently and have to move to homes higher above the tide-line; and the 16 houses and inn of Porthdinllaen on the Lleyn peninsula are likely to be lost because more stormy weather will bring more flooding and landslides, says the trust.</p> <p>Other risk areas identified are the puffin and seal colonies on the Farne Islands off the Northumberland coast; the shingle spit of East Head at the entrance to Chichester Harbour in West Sussex, which will also affect nearby West Wittering beach; Dorset's Studland beach, which is visited by more than one million people a year; the dune system of Formby, near Liverpool; the shingle spit and marshes of Blakeney national nature reserve in Norfolk; the sweeping sands of Rhossili on the Gower peninsula in Wales where a sand-covered medieval village is also being lost to the sea; and Northern Ireland's Portstewart Strand beach and dunes.</p> <p>In many cases the trust is investing in visitor centres and paths to keep access to the coast, but Dyke said that the trust wanted government to do more to help affected communities, especially property owners.</p>",
  "<p>Nick Cohen repeats the usual misconceptions about small-scale organic farming in his attack on Prince Charles (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/17/monarchy.gmcrops\">'Charles, a very modern Marie Antoinette'</a>, Comment, last week). As someone who traded a white collar profession for running a vegetable box scheme, I can assure him that the backbreaking drudgery of farm work is as nothing compared to the mind-numbing drudgery of modern office work. </p> <p>Cohen's implication that capital-intensive agribusiness has been a liberating force for the Latin American poor is also a serious misreading of the facts.

  "<p>It was billed as Channel 4's 'big idea', an ingenious way of safeguarding its future by extending its reach into radio. But the broadcaster's ambitious plan to launch 10 new digital stations, three under the Channel 4 name, are likely to be scaled back, The Observer has learnt, and the venture could even be shelved if behind-the-scenes negotiations to salvage it don't reach a successful conclusion within weeks.</p> <p>That would prompt questions about the channel's strategy and its long-term future; its chief executive, Andy Duncan, has staked his reputation on finding new sources of revenue by broadening C4's appeal beyond television. </p> <p>When 4 Digital, the consortium led by Channel 4, won a national digital licence in July 2007, the broadcaster boasted about bringing its cutting-edge creativity and marketing acumen to radio, prompting talk about the creation of a powerful competitor to the BBC. The corporation has a 55 per cent market share, but C4 planned to challenge that, launching Channel 4 Radio, a speech-based service that could rival Radios 4 and 5, and two music stations - E4 Radio, aimed at 15-to-29-year-olds, and Pure4, aimed at 30-to-49-year-olds - designed to capitalise on its innovative TV music output. </p> <p>The prospect of Jon Snow contributing to an equivalent of Radio 4's Today programme grabbed the industry's imagination, and there was speculation that shows such as Popworld could be transferred to radio, offering intelligent music coverage that would transcend the 'jukebox radio' of commercial competitors. It promised to launch as early as this summer. </p> <p>But some members of the C4 board have reservations, fearing the costly venture may not generate the returns predicted, and harbouring fundamental misgivings over the future of digital radio, which has failed to appeal to consumers in the way expected. </p> <p>According to a senior industry executive: 'Ploughing money into what would be very expensive services to operate - particularly the speech-based services - is a massive challenge. I'm certain there have been some very difficult conversations, and the board's split. I think [Channel 4 chairman] Luke [Johnson] has gone pretty lukewarm on it. The non-execs all read the papers and trade mags and know that digital radio is still a long, long way from being a success.' </p> <p>The fortunes of the first, and only other, national digital licence - or 'multiplex' - handed out by regulator Ofcom appears to support that claim. Controlled by Heart FM and Galaxy owner Global Radio, it has room for at least 10 channels, but only three are currently broadcasting. That is partly because their original owner, GCap Media, bought by Global earlier this year, scaled back investment in an attempt to fight off Global's hostile bid. </p> <p>But the same industry executive says: 'By recognising that Digital One - the first national multiplex - has hardly been a roaring success, the wisdom of launching a second one has to be questioned.'</p> <p>Channel 4 appears to have accepted that argument, and the favoured solution, currently under discussion, is for it to launch its channels on Global's multiplex instead and take a stake in the platform, with Global and its joint venture partner Arqiva receiving a share in 4 Digital in return. 4 Digital's network would then be mothballed until future channel launches. </p> <p>'The demand isn't high enough to fill two multiplexes', says a source close to the talks, 'so the industry's working for a joint venture where we both own a bit of each other's platforms.' A C4 source adds: 'When we originally applied for Digital Two, Digital One was full. [Now] we've got the stations, they've got the multiplex. If a deal can be done we will proceed with a version of our original plan.' </p> <p>That would see C4's three branded radio stations go ahead, with E4 Music the first to appear 'at the end of this year or the beginning of next', according to a senior C4 executive - but the board is likely to gauge its performance before sanctioning the remaining two. 'The timetable has changed a bit but we still have the same ambitions,' says the source. 'We are just rolling them out more slowly.' </p> <p>The problems is that negotiations with Global, and C4's own joint venture partners, are not proceeding smoothly. 4 Digital is majority owned by Channel 4, but some of the minority partners, who include UTV Radio and Magic FM owner Bauer Radio, have reservations about the cost of funding new digital channels at a time when the economic outlook is gloomy. Digital licences run for 12 years, and it costs \u00a31.5m a year to air a single station, says the source close to the talks. 'That's just the transmission: never mind the cost of running the station and paying the presenters. You could run a national FM or AM station for the same cost if the frequency was available.' </p> <p>Space on the old analogue platform is in short supply, of course, which is why digital looked so appealing. But take-up has been slow, partly because digital sets were expensive and the sound quality not always crystal clear. Sales are now accelerating, with seven million digital radio sets sold last year, a 22 per cent rise on 2006, and they are available for as little as \u00a315. But there are questions about whether the industry has the will to invest enough to make digital succeed. 'Over the next six weeks or so it's make or break for both services,' says the source involved in the talks. 'If I was offered even money on it, I wouldn't take it.' </p> <p>If a deal can't be struck, C4 must decide whether to press ahead by building its own multiplex, a more expensive option. And in the words of the source, 'the clock is ticking'. Under the terms of the licence, C4 must get it up and running two years after it was awarded - by July 2009 - and there is a real danger that deadline could be missed. If so, Ofcom will take the licence back. </p> <p>The stakes could hardly be higher. The foray into radio forms a central plank of Channel 4's strategy for survival in an age when increased competition from more channels means profits are falling, and it is asking for government money to plug a shortfall. A rival industry executive says: 'At a time when Channel 4 is saying it needs public funds, why is it launching expensive speech-based radio services? If you ask anyone in the radio industry they will say it will take several years of investment to make a good return.' Another says: 'It's fine to invest in the future if you've got the profits to do so.' </p> <p>The answer, according to Channel 4, is that the handout they are seeking is relatively small - reflecting the current value of the free analogue spectrum that will be worthless when UK television goes digital from 2012. In the meantime, it can't sit still and do nothing in a changing media environment where identifying alternative revenues is vital. </p> <p>Ofcom would also have to approve the proposed deal with Global, and is monitoring the talks closely, while Channel 4's director of radio, Nathalie Schwarz, is said to be updating her board on a weekly basis. </p> <p>If they are successful, both parties are likely to proclaim a fresh start for digital radio, arguing that a raft of new heavily-promoted stations will give digital new momentum and encourage take-up. But whatever the outcome of the talks, it seems unlikely Channel 4 will plunge headfirst into the radio market, choosing instead to place a toe in the water.</p>",
  "<p>Channel 4's ambitious plan to launch three national digital radio stations could be scaled back dramatically because of concerns about the cost of the venture. </p> <p>The broadcaster, which won a licence for a national digital 'multiplex' last year, is in talks with Global Radio, which owns the only other multiplex, about launching the stations on its platform instead. If that happens, C4's own network, 4 Digital, will be mothballed.</p> <p>The two parties are discussing a deal which would see C4 take a stake in Global's platform, with Global and its joint-venture partner, Arqiva offered a stake in 4 Digital in return. If an agreement is reached, the first of C4's branded stations, music-based E4, would appear on Global's platform towards the end of this year, or at the start of 2009, but the launch of the two remaining stations - another music channel and a speech-based offering to rival the BBC's Radio 4 - will be delayed.</p> <p>It is thought that some C4 board members have reservations about the cost of building its own 4 Digital network, but piggybacking on the Global multiplex would help to alleviate those concerns. They are likely to monitor the success of the first station before sanctioning the others. Any deal would need to be approved by regulator Ofcom.</p> <p>The talks are complicated because 4 Digital's junior partners, which include UTV and Bauer Radio, are having second thoughts about launching stations in the face of an advertising downturn. One source said: 'If you gave me even money [on the talks succeeding], I wouldn't take it.' If a deal isn't done, C4 will have to consider launching 4 Digital alone.</p>",
  "<p>\"'I just blew my mind,' said Usain Bolt, trying to put his achievements into words. 'I blew the world's mind.' It was classic Bolt, the entertainer who dances as well as runs for the crowd, and deadpans the one-liners. He did blow the world's mind, but who else would dare say such a thing? Over the past week some have found him cocky and immodest, but consider the facts of Bolt's achievements. </p> <p>At his first Olympic Games, Bolt became the first man in history to win three gold medals and set three world records in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay. And how. When Bolt broke Michael Johnson's 12-year-old 200m record of 19.32seconds, by 0.02sec he was running at an average speed of 37.305km per hour (23mph), covering an incredible 10.3m per second. </p> <p>Five days earlier, the then 21-year-old seemed to jog through the 100m, brazenly slowing down for the final 10m, arms out, hardly out of breath, lowering his own world record to 9.69sec. On Friday night he completed the hat-trick, helping his team to another Jamaican gold medal and breaking the 4x100m relay world record held by the US team for eight years. </p> <p>Every Jamaican medallist has subsequently hailed Bolt as their inspiration - their own successes labelled 'the Bolt effect'. Jamaica's Prime Minister, Bruce Golding, called to tell him that back home the country is road-blocked. In Kingston's Mandela Park huge screens were set up to watch the athletics and from morning to night, at each of Bolt's victories, people partied in the streets in celebration. </p> <p>Since breaking Asafa Powell's 100m world record in May - having only run that distance at a senior level on four previous occasions - Bolt has gone from being just another Jamaican sprinter to possibly one of the greatest athletes of all time. Within days of his first triumph it was possible to buy Usain Bolt watches, stamps and T-shirts. </p> <p>It is a steep trajectory that brings with it global recognition as well as scrutiny. How is it possible to run so fast? Faster than any convicted drug cheat. In the same breath, people ask why the Jamaican team have been more successful than ever - there are more medals than there are Jamaican journalists covering the Games.</p> <p>Bolt understands the suggestion, and is patient with his answers. 'We've been tested a lot,' he said yesterday, 'I was tested four times before I even started running, urine and blood tests. I've been tested so many times now I've lost track. I have no problem with that, we work hard and we're clean and anytime they want to test us it's fine.'</p> <p>It is an accusation that all Jamaicans involved in athletics have been defending against. Asafa Powell's coach, Stephen Francis, who first saw Bolt run as a 13-year-old at the Jamaican National Schools Championships dismissed the question. 'It's not explainable how they do what they do. It doesn't mean he's cheating, he's just using what he has. Usain ran 19.9 aged 17, when he was a skinny kid. Look at him now, 19.3 is not that surprising.' </p> <p>'I can't stop people doubting,' said Francis. 'People always have a way of belittling or trying to explain things they can't understand by saying, \"Yeah, Usain Bolt, he's cheating, he's not real.\" But in the world people come along who are exceptional. You have Einstein, you have Isaac Newton, you have Beethoven - you have Usain Bolt.'</p> <p>Bolt was born to parents Wellesley and Jennifer, in Trelawny Parish, on the north coast of Jamaica. A rural area, known historically for its high number of sugar plantations and a large Maroon population, its more recent claim to fame is producing world-class athletes such as Ben Johnson and Veronica Campbell-Brown. What is so special about Trelawny? Wellesley Bolt puts it down to the distinctive yellow yams of the area that make up his son's breakfast, along with a starchy combo of dumplings and green banana. </p> <p>At William Knibb Memorial High School, Bolt was identified as a naturally gifted athlete. Dwight Barnett, one of Bolt's PE teachers, described the young Bolt's talent as head-scratching. 'Sometimes I'd look at that stop-watch and think, \"There's something wrong with this watch. No kid can run that quickly.\"'</p> <p>But Bolt's first true love was cricket, not athletics. Even now he lights up at the mention of Chris Gayle and Freddie Flintoff, 'I love the aggressive players,' he said. When he goes back to Jamaica he plays cricket in the local parks. Pablo McNeil, Bolt's first coach - a former Olympic sprinter - recalled the challenge of getting him on to the running track. 'The first time I saw Usain bowling I knew he was a born sprinter, he was so fast,' he said. 'But he was so cricket-mad that he took a bit of persuading. Initially he was quite hard to work with, he needed to be kept in line... nothing malicious, just pranks that got a bit out of hand, he certainly kept you on your toes.</p> <p>'I knew a long time that he was a cut above the rest. He's got an incredible stride, which just eats up the ground. I'm not in the least bit surprised at what he is achieving because I predicted five or six years ago that he was going to break world records. Anyone who saw him as a kid wouldn't have needed to be a prophet to tell you that.'</p> <p>McNeil frames Bolt's achievements in the context of the great Jamaican athletes that came before him. 'No Jamaican sportsman has ever had as much pressure on him. Not Herb McKenley, not George Rhoden, not Arthur Wint, not Don Quarrie, no one. You have no idea how hard that is. He's going to be the greatest sprinter this world has ever seen. In fact, he might be already.'</p> <p>Anybody who follows athletics in Jamaica watches the annual Champs - a high school athletics meet attended by 30,000 spectators, reported on in the island's news pages - the testing ground for future stars of track and field. The meet is so competitive it attracts a passionate and partisan crowd, each school has its own flag and there are often clashes between supporters. This is where many saw Bolt run for the first time. </p> <p>'I first saw Usain when he was 13 years old,' said Francis. 'A skinny, tall guy. But then he went to the final and didn't do much.' Did Francis pick him out as a future charge? 'Actually, I doubted whether he would make the transition. I figured he would be trying to go abroad. I figured he would be lost like so many others before him.'</p> <p>More than 2,000 Jamaican athletes compete in the Champs each year, and many fall by the wayside. It wasn't until the age of 15 and already 6ft 5in tall that Bolt made a name for himself, winning the 200m at the world junior championships - the youngest to do so - held in Jamaica that year. Bolt won in world record time, an achievement that would change his life. </p> <p>'Suddenly he was a big star,' said Francis, 'He got a lot of encouragement from the federation who wanted him to stay in Jamaica. It was the opposite situation to Asafa who had no choice but to stay, Usain had everything possible done for him to keep him from going abroad.'</p> <p>Germaine Mason, the British high jumper and silver medallist in Beijing who switched nationality from Jamaica in 2006, has been friends with Bolt since their junior days. 'I remember him at the junior world championships,' said Mason. 'He had three medals clinking around his neck when anyone else was lucky just to have one. There he was walking along, joking with everybody, clink clink clink.'</p> <p>Success brought Bolt a move to Kingston, but his popularity proved a distraction and he spent more time partying than training. Elton Tucker, assistant editor of Jamaica's most popular newspaper, The Gleaner, has been reporting on sport on the island for 27 years and remembers that period. 'Usain and Asafa, we call them country boys. When Bolt moved to Kingston he was looking at the bright lights - where he came from there were no street lights. Suddenly there was Burger King and KFC.' </p> <p>After the 100m race Bolt said he would love to eat a burger as a treat, 'but he didn't mean McDonald's,' said Tucker, 'their burgers are too small. Jamaicans like to have what we call a bellyful. </p> <p>'As a teenager Bolt wasn't focused, he liked nightclubs, playing basketball, he thought he could run on natural talent alone.'</p> <p>What got him to knuckle down? 'Bolt was from a poor family, just ordinary country folk. He saw Asafa driving BMWs and Mercedes-Benz and he wanted that.' Others believe it was the strict influence of his current coach, Glen Mills, that made the difference after they began working together in 2005. Known as a disciplinarian, it is significant that Bolt leaves his career decisions to Mills. </p> <p>Still, international success at a senior level did not come overnight. There were hints, running the 200m in less than 20sec at Crystal Palace in 2005, winning two bronze medals at international grand-prix events, but at key moments Bolt was plagued by injuries - at the 2004 Olympics and the 2005 World Championships in Helsinki. By last year's World Championships in Osaka Bolt was beginning to shape up, winning silver behind Tyson Gay in the 200m. It was the confidence booster he needed, the catalyst to setting four world records in 2008. </p> <p>Suddenly everything Bolt touched turned to gold. After the 100m in Beijing, Powell and Gay were out of the picture, Bolt became 'Lightning Bolt' and everybody wanted to talk to him. Delighted and delirious, Bolt celebrated as a young man, dancing and entertaining the crowd. Jacques Rogge, the IOC president, was not impressed and swiftly labelled Bolt's antics as disrespectful to his competitors. But the man that Rogge and others describe is unrecognisable to those who know Bolt well. </p> <p>'Usain is very humble off the track,' said Mason. 'He's not like what you see on the TV. I disagree with what Jacques Rogge said. When you win an Olympic medal that's the greatest thing ever, you don't just want to win and walk off the track, you want to entertain the crowd. You want to open up and express how you're feeling. His celebrations are a very good thing for the sport.'</p> <p>Barnett said that Usain's biggest problem at school was being too nice. 'There was one kid [Jermaine Gonzales] who he was really friendly with and he was worried when he had to race him in a 400m. I had to take him aside and tell him that athletics was about people beating other people and it was everyone for themselves.'</p> <p>Back in Jamaica, Bolt's celebrations were applauded. His dancehall moves put Jamaican popular culture on the map; Jamaican flag in one hand and his gold running spikes in the other, Bolt danced the nuh linga to the bafflement of the rest of the world. 'It's a thing in Jamaica. You wouldn't really understand,' said Bolt. 'I made it my celebration. My celebration to the world.' After the 200m he bent down low to perform the gully creeper, the creator of which - a friend of his called Ice - has now invented a new dance called the Usain Bolt. 'It is one of the maddest tings,' said Ice. 'Like the gully net, but more fancy, mi drop in a little neck movement.' </p> <p>Friends of Bolt describe him as a young man who loves a party. After winning the 200m Bolt said he wished he was 'at the Quad', a nightclub in New Kingston where Jamaicans often see him out, bottle of Guinness in hand, celebrating his victories. 'It's like my second home.' </p> <p>What now for Bolt? Will anyone ever beat him? 'I've not yet figured out how he does it,' said Francis, 'but when I know, I'll try and find the boy to beat him. I don't think he's unbeatable but it's going to be a rare person who has the chance. A very rare person.' </p> <p>As the rest of the world struggle to understand how anyone can perform such incredible athletic feats, Bolt is characteristically philosophical. 'I wouldn't say I'm a phenomenon,' he said, pausing for some time to think about it, 'just a great athlete.'</p>",
  "<p>When the Notting Hill riots started 50 years ago, I had been in a London school for two-and-a-half years. I was 14 and it was probably the biggest, most dramatic event in my life up to that time, but nothing about it was totally astonishing, because it was precisely the sort of event I had been fearing since I arrived.</p> <p>Today, walking around London with my teenage son, it's hard to explain why it was no great surprise back then, as those first pictures of howling mobs chasing black men through the streets were shown around the world. Struggling to make sense of it, I tell him that I knew what was happening simply because of what I saw and what I felt about all the little things that went to make up our ordinary everyday life then. I tell him that the past is a different country and the differences are most noticeable not in the big changes, but in the small, unremarkable happenings.</p> <p>Since 1958, there have been laws intended to prevent or inhibit the sort of violent assaults that we saw in Notting Hill, beginning with the draconian sentences handed out to some of the worse offenders. Then came the Race Relations Act followed by various tranches of immigration legislation, followed by new housing provisions and so on and so on. In the wake of all this, myths have grown up around the Notting Hill riots. Explanations for them abound. From the left come cries of poverty and deprivation, housing need and frustration. From the right, the Powellite agenda, which rationalises the riots in terms of liberal bullying of a neglected working class, discredited but still with resonance, resurfacing from time to time in one guise or another. In recent years, another (black) myth has begun to emerge, one that places the riots at the beginning of an official multicultural cause, exemplified by the Notting Hill Carnival this weekend.</p> <p>All of these are certain to show up in any discussion about the meaning of the Notting Hill riots. In all the commentary, however, there is one element that is routinely neglected. That is about how people feel about themselves and about the undramatic routine of their lives, the everyday events that dictate how happy we can be in our environment. Last week, I went to a supermarket late in the evening. It was all routine. My partner and I were feeling rather giggly, partly because the teenage son was away for the night. Halfway down the first aisle, we encountered a young white woman stacking shelves and she began bantering with us. I don't remember what she said, but we all laughed uproariously. At the checkout, there was an Asian girl wreathed in smiles. It struck me that this was an experience which is absolutely normal, but would have been unimaginable 50 years ago. </p> <p>Looking back, what I remember is being surrounded by an atmosphere of suspicion, indifference or hostility. In those days, out in public, if you smiled or spoke to a white person you didn't know, the response was most likely to be concern, offence or even physical assault. It was safer not to speak to anyone, because any encounter could provoke a racist jibe. Pick up the local newspaper and you were certain to read reports, features or letters which were offensive or threatening or downright racist. Switch on the radio and you were certain to hear an interview, or a speech or joke, which reminded you that you were the object of your neighbours' anger, dislike or contempt. That was 1958 and that was a different country and there was a sense in which the Notting Hill riots summed up what I could feel around me every time I went out of the house. </p> <p>I don't feel that today. Nowadays, I am a relatively respectable gent of a certain age and no one has in for me, unless they know who I am. It is easy to note the contrasts with that other time, 50 years ago, in the ease with which most black people navigate the city. This isn't the case only in London. I could say similar things about Leeds or Birmingham or Manchester. In any number of routine encounters, it is easy to appreciate the extent to which the country has changed. Coming back from abroad, I don't feel even the smallest part of the caution I used to. This country is home. </p> <p>On the other hand, it is impossible to escape the realisation that, for many, more recent migrants, the city offers an experience which feels uncomfortably like the way it was for black migrants in the Fifties. In the last few months, I've heard more than one diatribe directed at assistants in shops or banks, beginning with the familiar: 'You people ...' and ending with the suggestion that the object of the abuse should 'go back where you came from'. A familiar narrative which I would have labelled racist, had it not been for the fact that the abuser was black and the abused an embarrassed European or African.</p> <p>This, I tell myself, is simply one moving part of the mechanism which changes the country and its population. The process of engagement, whether it's difficult, hostile or even violent, is a fundamental part of this change and no one can stop it. All we can do is moderate its worst effects.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Mike Phillips is the co-author of Windrush: Irresistible Rise of Multi-racial Britain</p>",
  "<p>In 1969, a year after Russian tanks rolled into Prague, Josef Koudelka visited London with a Czech theatre group. One Sunday morning he was walking out of his hotel near the Aldwych Theatre when he saw some members of the theatre group perusing a copy of the Sunday Times magazine. As he passed, he saw to his surprise that they were looking at his own extraordinary photographs of that Russian invasion and the spontaneous street protests it provoked. The same photos have since become the definitive pictorial record of a pivotal event in 20th century history.</p> <p>'They showed me the magazine where it said that these pictures had been taken by an unknown photographer from Prague and smuggled out of the country,' he says, shaking his head as if he still cannot believe it. 'I could not tell anyone that they were my photographs. It was a very strange feeling. From that moment, I was afraid to go back to Czechoslovakia because I knew that if they wanted to find out who the unknown photographer was, they could do it.'</p> <p>Before he returned to Prague, Koudelka began making preparations to leave again, this time for good. He began by contacting the Magnum photographic agency, which had placed his work in the Sunday Times, attributing the images to PP (Prague Photographer) lest he and his family should suffer reprisals. Magnum subsequently wrote a letter to the Czech Ministry of Culture saying they had given him a grant to photograph Gypsies across Europe. It worked. In 1970, when his visa ran out, Koudelka did not return home. Suddenly stateless, he too became a kind of Gypsy, constantly on the move, forsaking the very notion of a homeland.</p> <p>So began perhaps the most remarkable journey in 20th century photography. When I meet him today, in the back room of his new apartment in Prague, Koudelka unfolds a battered map of the world he has just found in one of the many boxes stacked along a wall. It is covered in spidery ink trails that trace his wanderings through Europe and beyond, his handwriting providing a runic commentary of the festivals and gatherings he attended along the way. The map dates from the Seventies and looks like a strange work of art, which, in a way, it is. The real art, though, lies in the photographs Koudelka produced when he began chronicling his restlessness - and rootlessness - as well as his newfound sense of freedom. His first major work, published in 1975, was called simply Gypsies, his second, from 1988, Exiles. Their titles alone tell you much about Koudelka's own life as well as the lives of his subjects.</p> <p>'For 17 years I never paid any rent,' he says, laughing and raising a shot glass of slivovic, a plum brandy he has produced to welcome me to Prague. 'Even the Gypsies were sorry for me because they thought I was poorer than them. At night they were in their caravans and I was the guy who was sleeping outside beneath the sky.'</p> <p>Now, 38 years after he began his exile, and 40 years after the invasion, Josef Koudelka has a place in Prague that, were he so inclined, he could call home. It is an apartment on the corner of a quiet square near the city centre, opposite a church where, he tells me proudly, the young Dvorak once wrote music. It is light, airy and purely functional: a place to work rather than rest. The boxes of notebooks, meticulously classified, suggest a highly ordered mind. 'Josef is utterly methodical, and utterly aware of his own legend and his legacy,' says his close friend, the photographer, Eliott Erwitt. 'But he is also an eccentric. He thinks differently, and, as we know from the work, he sees the world differently.'</p> <p>At 70, Koudelka has, like his late friend Henri Cartier-Bresson, achieved semi-mythic status as a photographer. Alongside Robert Frank, he is the last of the great hard-bitten romantics of 20th century reportage, and, like Frank, he is a hero of mine. Gypsies was the first photography book I ever owned, and though I cannot remember now how I came by it, I can still recall its impact on me. I was studying in London for a degree in English, and Gypsies seemed to me to possess a more powerful narrative than many of the contemporary novels I was reading. I looked at it again in preparation for this interview, and found it still retains the power to mesmerise with its raw beauty, its essential sadness. There is something beautifully melancholic in Koudelka's images, a sadness the Portuguese call saudade, a deep-rooted longing for which there is no equivalent word in English. </p> <p>When I mention this, he nods in agreement. 'The mother of my son, an Italian lady, she once told me, \"Josef, you go though life and get all this positive energy, and all the sadness, you just throw it behind you and it drops into the bag you carry on your back. Then, when you photograph, it all comes out.\" Perhaps there could be some truth in that.' </p> <p>Koudelka, his youthful face framed by white straggly hair, has the demeanour of someone 20 years younger, and proves to be a generous and engaging host. He offers me his old flat in the suburbs of Prague to stay in, and insists on paying for lunch and drinks two days running. He famously does not grant many interviews and, one senses, astutely maintains his own mythology by his silence. Today, though, the anecdotes flow as freely as the wine. </p> <p>Koudelka has returned to Prague from his adopted home in Paris for an exhibition of his '68 photographs that is being held in the Old Town Hall to coincide with the 40th anniversary of the invasion. A book called Invasion 68: Prague was published earlier this year, an extraordinary chronicle of those convulsive seven days when the people of Prague, young and old, took to the streets in their thousands to protest at the Russian presence.</p> <p>'For a long time no one here was interested in remembering,' says Koudelka, 'but now I think they start to remember again. If this book helps the remembering I am happy. We Czechs are not like you Irish or the Poles. We do not behave bravely many times against the odds, but in this one week, as my book shows, we should be very proud of how we behave.' </p> <p>In that one week, the 30-year-old Koudelka took over 5,000 photographs on the streets of Prague, often under extreme conditions. He was shot at by a Russian soldier, and pursued through the crowds and into the backstreets around Wenceslas Square. In the short film that ends the exhibition, a young and scrawny Koudelka is seen perched on a Russian tank, filming a young Czech man waving a flag of resistance. </p> <p>Some of the people in the photographs turned up for the opening of the show, including a man whose arm Koudelka had positioned in the foreground of an empty Prague street, the watch on his wrist telling the time of the invasion. 'Forty years have gone by,' says Koudelka, 'and I do not remember them nor they me. You cannot rely on your memories - but you can rely on your pictures.'</p> <p>Back then, he says, he did not even know the word 'photojournalism'. 'I had not seen Life or Paris Match. For me, it was just important to photograph what I was part of.' To this end, he used a primitive Exakta camera and countless rolls of cinema film that he had bought cheaply from a friend, and which he cut into strips, then draped over his shoulder and fed into the camera. 'I used to have to run home to reload, always thinking I was missing something. Once, I think it saved my life. I was reloading when I heard the explosion that killed many people outside the radio station.' Until now, remarkably, the world has only seen 10 of those images. </p> <p>'Originally, I did not want to make the book or the exhibition,' he says. 'I knew already I had selected the 10 best. And, to be truthful, when I was working on this book, I did not discover one that I would have added to these 10. They are the ones that have a universal value. In them it is not so important who is Russian and who is Czech. It is more important that one man has a gun and one man has not.'</p> <p>The previously unseen images, though, are powerful for different reasons. They provide a unique visual record of 20th century history as it unfolded, an event of incredible emotional and political intensity that lasted a week yet changed the course of a nation for two decades afterwards. In one brilliantly composed image after another, Koudelka has also captured the energy of mass protest like no one before or since, an energy that flared from angry disbelief into violent protest and then faded just as suddenly. 'When I look at these pictures now, I can't believe I did them. Magnum could not believe it was the work of one photographer. I was everywhere because everywhere I looked in those seven days there is another photograph waiting for me. I did not have time to even think about the danger.'</p> <p>In one unforgettable image he snapped a tiny old man on his way to work, briefcase in hand, who suddenly stopped to hurl a cobblestone at a Russian tank. In another, he captured a young man holding his coat open as if inviting a nervous soldier on a tank to shoot him in the heart. In another, a pretty woman pleads with the Russian commander who stares over her head, implacable, imperious. </p> <p>'In truth, I felt no hatred for these soldiers,' he says now. They were not responsible for this. They were young like me, and we were in the same system. What happened to them could easily have happened to me. They could have woken me one morning and sent me to Warsaw or wherever they wanted. Back then, none of us was free.'</p> <p>The pursuit of freedom is what has fuelled Koudelka's life ever since, and that has manifested itself in a desire to be constantly on the move. Initially, when he began living in London in 1970, unable to speak English very well, he used the large Bayswater flat of fellow Magnum photographer David Hurn as his base. </p> <p>'It was nicknamed the Dosshouse,' says Hurn, 'because every struggling photographer passed though there at the time and slept on the floor. Josef was brought there by Elliot [Erwitt], who had been involved in helping him get out of Czechoslovakia, and the understanding was that he would be staying a few weeks. Like everyone else, he asked if he could use my darkroom to develop some film. He turned up with 800 rolls. I think, in the end, he stayed there off and on for about nine years.'</p> <p>London was his base in the winter but, come the summer, he would head off on his travels across Europe, rucksack and sleeping bag slung over his shoulders. He photographed Gypsies at the Epsom races and Appleby Horse Fair, pilgrims on St Patrick's Mountain and Lough Derg in Ireland, and itinerant musicians in Spain and Portugal, always travelling light and with little money, always sleeping in the open air. Like all great photographers he possesses an eye for telling detail and a formal mastery that, even in his snatched reportage, seems uncanny in its compositional brilliance. In one startling image that has haunted me since I first saw it, a bewildered young Gypsy in handcuffs stands alone on a hill while in the middle distance a line of people, and a few uncertain-looking policemen, stand watching like onlookers in an absurdist drama. The man, it turns out, had just been arrested and charged with murdering his wife. </p> <p>The Gypsies he photographed called Koudelka the 'romantico clandestino'. 'I photograph only something that has to do with me,' he says, 'and I never did anything that I did not want to do. I do not do editorial and I never do advertising. No, my freedom is something I do not give away easily. And I do not follow the war because I am not interested in photographing violence. Sure, if I was in Georgia now, I would be photographing what happens.'</p> <p>He stops, shakes his head, and reaches for another glass of wine. 'You know, people say, \"Oh, Josef, he is the eternal outsider,\" but on the contrary I try always to be an insider, both as a photographer and as a man. I am part of everything that is around me.'</p> <p>Koudelka was born in a village of 400 people in Moravia in 1938, close to where Milan Kundera, that other famous Czech exile, grew up. As a child, he was fascinated by folk music, planes and the family photographs the local baker took on a Bakelite camera. 'Once I saw the bread man's camera, I went off every day to the woods to pick wild strawberries to sell to the man who made ice-cream. In this way I saved the money to buy a camera of my own.' </p> <p>When he moved to Prague to study engineering, Koudelka fell under the influence of Jiri Janicek, who ran a photographic club for students. Soon he was contributing to a theatre magazine called Divadio, where he published his first serious body of work: intense, close-up portraits of the actors in rehearsal. Until 1967, though, he worked as an aeronautical engineer in Prague and Bratislava. 'It was fantastic because I loved aeroplanes as much as photographs,' he says, 'but there came a point where I knew that if I stayed in engineering, I would surely die. I had no ambition to be the boss, and I had all the responsibility for the people's safety. With a camera you are your own boss, responsible only to yourself. You are alone with the camera, there is no one else to blame.'</p> <p>Until the upheaval of Prague '68, Koudelka sought out and photographed Czechoslovakian Gypsies. Afterwards, in exile, and now a full-time member of Magnum, he forged an unlikely friendship with the agency's founder, the great French photographer, Henri Cartier-Bresson, and lived on small grants and awards while he searched out Gypsy communities across Europe. Between travels he would turn up out of the blue at the Magnum office in Paris and sleep there for weeks under a desk. His late father, he tells, me, used to send him home-brewed slivovic every month. 'It was a plastic bottle with the word vinegar written on it in Czech. This way, he thought I would not have to pay duty on it.' He became known around the Magnum office as 'Le Remplisseur Professionnel' (the professional pourer). 'After the first glass, no one can breathe,' he says, cracking up at the memory. 'After two, the girls are dancing around the floor.'</p> <p>Koudelka speaks without regret about his constant travelling. 'In Britain the Gypsy children would always ask me two questions: \"Do you sleep dressed?\" and \"When was the last time you saw your people?\" They were nomads but they returned to the same places every year and caught up with their own people. I think they pitied me because I could not do that.' </p> <p>When I ask David Hurn if Koudelka ever seemed homesick, he replies: 'Josef is not the sort of man to dwell on stuff like that but he would sometimes fall silent and take himself off somewhere.' He would often disappear into the kitchen to make mashed potatoes with caraway seeds. 'He seemed to live on this one dish, and, like his insistence on sleeping on the floor, I initially thought it was a kind of romantic affectation. Then one day his mother turned up from Prague to visit. She could not speak a word of English. One afternoon she said something. I asked Josef to translate, and he said, \"My mother just said how much she would love a big plate of mashed potatoes with caraway seed.\"'</p> <p>Though he has never maintained a long-term relationship, Koudelka has three children by three women in three countries: two grown-up daughters and a son of 13. Recently, when a teacher asked the boy what his father did, he replied, 'He's a nomad.' </p> <p>When pressed, Koudelka talks with pride about his children, but one detects regret too. 'Listen,' he says, when we meet the following day over a beer, and I broach the subject of family and commitment, 'I am not a family man and I can never be a family man. But I am very happy, I have children and I hope that they are happy that they exist. From the beginning I make certain rules with my children and one is that I can't be with them all the time. I tell them that when I am with them, I am for them, and when I am not there, it is best they should try to forget that I exist.' </p> <p>This flintiness exists side by side with his generosity of spirit, but essentially, one suspects, Koudelka is indeed a nomad and one of life's loners. Though he does not let people get too close he maintains many deep and abiding friendships. But one senses that his life, like his photography, is undergoing a profound change, and the new apartment in Prague is only the most visible sign that he can no longer maintain the nomadic lifestyle that framed his restless art and the arc of his younger life.</p> <p>In the last 10 years or so people have disappeared from his photographs altogether, and he now works obsessively on panoramic landscapes that often portray the devastation industrialisation has wreaked on the natural environment. He has two shows coming up in New York at the Aperture and Pace MacGill galleries, and he is also completing a long-term project that records the changing countryside near Piedmont, and considering a commission that would take him to Israel to document the so-called security wall that has annexed more land from the Palestinians.</p> <p>'If I go,' he says defiantly, 'it will be to photograph the wall not as a political problem but because of its devastation of the landscape. And this is monumental. I see this wall as a failure of civilisation. That is a subject for sure, but I need to know how the images will be used, and if I have creative control. This is one of the many important things I learn from Cartier-Bresson - you must always ask where the money comes from.'</p> <p>As we wind down over a last beer in a bar near his flat, I sense that Koudelka has grown impatient with all this questioning, but the mention of Cartier-Bresson sets him off on another bout of reminiscing. Earlier he had shown me a letter of introduction the French master sent to American photographer Cornell Capa ahead of Koudelka's first trip to the US. It says simply: 'I am sending you a madman called Josef.' </p> <p>What was the basis of his friendship with Cartier-Bresson? Koudelka thinks for a long while: 'We fight and disagree all the time,' he says, throwing back his head and laughing. 'He tries to tell me how to think, and I tell him exactly what I think, then he shouts, \"How can I have such a man in my house?\" This is how it could goes with us, and then it would be quickly forgotten. As a photographer I do not think he influenced me, but he helped me to understand how the profession worked. In fact I have learned so much from him, as a man, that it is impossible to put in words. He questioned everything all the time, and he was so full of generosity to me.' </p> <p>Not for the first time today, Koudelka's eyes fill up, but he drinks some more beer, and continues: 'Once, Henri rang me in Paris and said, \"Josef, Kert\u00e9sz is in town, you must come to dinner and meet him.\" He held Kert\u00e9sz in the highest regard as a photographic master. I said, \"Henri, I love his pictures but I do not need to meet him.\" The phone goes down. Then he rings back and says, \"No, you do not understand, you have to meet him because we three, we are of the same family.\" At the time, this seems to me to be an unbelievable thing to say. Now, though, when I look back from a distance, I can see that maybe there is something in that.'</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Invasion 68: Prague is published by Thames &amp; Hudson at \u00a329.95.

  "<p>A piercing whistle brings the lambs bounding up the hill, corralled into a tight, wild-eyed bundle by Fern, the sheepdog. Sunlight glints off the reservoir below, while beyond the heather-cloaked moors are shimmering purple.</p> <p>'Oh, it's a beautiful spot all right,' says farmer Peter Wood, 62, as he surveys his fields, bordered by proud drystone walls, high up in the Derbyshire Peak District. 'But if it wasn't for my lad working for me for next to nothing ... well, we might as well shut the door and be done with it. And that's a fact.'</p> <p>It's a sombre fact, but just one of many dictating government policy as a desperate battle is waged to protect the UK's uplands. Many Britons decamp on holiday to our spectacular highlands, but few realise how crucial they are to everyone's workaday lives. Moors, mountains, hills and valleys provide food, drinking water, a weekend recharge for urban-weary batteries, rare birds and butterflies, and a powerful arsenal in the escalating war against climate change.</p> <p>But their future is fragile. 'The uplands are facing a huge threat,' says Pat Thompson, uplands conservation officer at the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). 'It's as urgent as standing here in 20 years' time with your grandchildren asking: \"What on earth were you lot doing in 2008?\" 'Erosion, the legacy of overgrazing, artificial drainage, unregulated burning of moorland, and industrial pollution of the atmosphere have degraded vast areas. Much is at stake, but the problem is that there are many stakeholders. And as the powerful environmental lobby captures the government's ear, there are competing interests, each with a voice to be heard.</p> <p>The fight to preserve the uplands has made them a battleground of tension and feud. The hill farmers' financial plight, the grouse shooters' wealth, rows over burning heather, accusations over poisoned birds of prey and water companies' demands - all are thorny issues that add up to a complex jigsaw. </p> <p>The National Trust is now calling on government to deliver a clear strategy. One immediate concern is keeping farmers on the hills. Dan Houseago, of the National Trust, says: 'We are asking farmers to do so much more than just produce a sheep. We are asking them to ensure a beautiful, colourful landscape, to protect all sorts of rare and wonderful birds, to provide lovely habitats for shooting and hunting, to give us clean drinking water and carbon storage as well as food. It's a big, big ask.'</p> <p>With declining incomes and an average age of 58, the farmers who work these challenging areas, where poor soil conditions leave few options other than raising sheep and cattle, are finding life very tough. Until recently, subsidies helped them to balance the books - the more livestock they raised, the more they got in payments. The hill farm allowance (HFA) compensated them for staying on the hills - a grant to safeguard rural communities in areas officially designated as 'less favoured'. </p> <p>But today, environmentalists point to damage caused by overgrazing, drainage and burning, the legacy of generations of farmers seeking to eke out a living. Now they receive payments for acreage rather than number of livestock to encourage them to de-stock, and other grants are stringently pegged to the environmental benefits they can provide for all of us.</p> <p>The result has been that upland farmers are being driven out, and sons and daughters are turning their backs on the family heritage. 'That is sending shock signals across the environmental movement,' says Thompson, 'because we recognise the incredibly important contribution that livestock and well-managed husbandry makes to the uplands. It's vital. We cannot afford to lose this incredibly skilled workforce, and right now we are losing them.' A new study indicates that sheep numbers have declined by up to 60 per cent in some areas of the Scottish uplands. Environment Secretary Hilary Benn announced last month that the hill farm allowance would be replaced by a special uplands environment payment in England.</p> <p>From too many grazing animals on our hills, the fear now is of too few. Grazing is essential to keep vegetation down, to prevent grass wastelands where little thrives. Well-managed upland is essential. The upland areas cover 40 per cent of Britain's land mass and provide 70 per cent of our drinking water, and their beauty attracts 100 million day visits annually. They offer refuge to threatened species, including the black grouse, ring ouzel, curlew, golden plover and twite. They preserve 75 per cent of the world's remaining heather moors. As climate change tops every agenda, too few are aware that its peat and blanket bogs store some 5 billion tonnes of carbon - the equivalent of more than 20 years of the UK's carbon dioxide emissions. If cared for, peatlands could absorb 41,000 tonnes of carbon a year. But if dried out, they will release 381,000 tonnes a year into the atmosphere or the water table. </p> <p>This landscape has been formed through centuries of management. Farmers like Wood are crucial, but he is not alone in feeling frustrated by the policy pendulum of recent years. Crookhill Farm, which he rents off the National Trust, is perched high in the idyllic Hope Valley, but he would have no hope of maintaining its 320 acres and 800 sheep without his son David, 32, who fits work on the farm around jobs as a contract shepherd, shearer and sheepdog handler. Battered by rising fuel and feed costs, Wood is forced to sell most of his stock as store lambs, as he cannot afford to fatten them, thereby handing over potential profits to lowland farmers with richer pasture. The bed-and-breakfast business run by his wife, Janet, provided pin money for holidays, as did his sideline as a sheepdog trainer. 'Now they are vital lifelines.'</p> <p>He must accumulate a requisite number of points to qualify for the higher end of the new environmental schemes, but like many is struggling to tick enough biodiversity boxes due to his farm's size and situation. He has his seven miles of drystone walls, but will they count? 'Drystone walls are a hugely important landscape feature, and we believe they are not being given anything like sufficient points weighting in recognition of the actual cost of maintaining them,' says Will Cockbain, an uplands officer for the National Farmers' Union.</p> <p>Changes to subsidies are said to have reduced their worth to moorland farmers by at least 70 per cent in the past 20 years, and there are fears that the new environment schemes will not make up the shortfall. 'Depopulation is the main danger,' says Maurice Retallick, 65, who farms 500 acres on Dartmoor. Today he has mainly cattle; he has cut the number of his ewes from 1,200 to 200, partly due to foot-and-mouth fears and also in keeping with environmental requirements.</p> <p>'We're all dyed-in-the-wool farmers round here and very loath to give up. But the next generation are thinking twice about it. I know of five or six young farming couples who have split up over the pressures. We lose farmers, we lose livestock. And once we start losing livestock, we start losing the uplands.'</p> <p>Hill farming is not the only concern. Wood's farm lies 15 miles from Sheffield off the A57 'Snake Pass' road which wends it way through the Peak District's moors towards Manchester. This year 1,000 acres of that moorland is blooming for the first time in living memory, thanks to Geoff Eyre, 63, an agriculturist and part-time hill farmer who has pioneered a revolutionary germination technique which has made him the world's expert in heather restoration. Part of the expense was covered through government schemes, and the rest came from private moor owners. Just a handful of birds were recorded on the land before the re-seeding five years ago. Today there are thousands.</p> <p>Eyre has his misgivings about the moors' future. One worry is over government policy to restrict heather burning. Grouse moor managers have always done this. It creates a mosaic of different lengths of heather needed for the wild red grouse, the game bird found only in Britain, and the sport of grouse shooting is worth \u00a312.5m to rural economies in England each year. Adrian Blackmore, moorland policy officer for the Countryside Alliance, said: 'If it wasn't for grouse, the well-managed moors that make up parts of the uplands as we know and love them would be a barren wilderness of grass and old heather supporting no wildlife.' Through burning and the control of predators such as foxes, stoats and crows, gamekeepers also provide for ground-nesting wading birds, he maintains. A recent survey by Natural England of 17 moorland sites of special scientific interest found that the RSPB's Geltsdale reserve in Cumbria had the lowest numbers of moorland birds compared with the keepered grouse moors surrounding it - due, Blackmore claims, to lack of predator control.</p> <p>The RSPB worries about bad burning, where the fire gets out of control and leads to erosion. The government now only allows burning under tight restrictions. But Eyre feels it has gone too far, and that overgrown heather and grass risk wildfires of Californian proportions. 'If we have an east wind, in 10 years' time here in the Peak District we are going to end up having to evacuate people out of Manchester because the moors are burning and smouldering away.'</p> <p>With so many agendas, bodies like the National Trust fear a 'chaotic and unplanned' evolution of the uplands. With public money difficult to get, private partnerships could be the way forward. Houseago believes water companies - which spend hundreds of millions a year cleansing water of pollution caused by erosion and farming methods - could invest in encouraging farmers to help provide cleaner, cheaper drinking water. He also sees potential in carbon offset markets. 'You can get your stocking rates right, stop eroding, stop draining, stop it drying out and oxidising into the atmosphere, hold water on bits of land, turn them into a store of carbon. Carbon markets could make millions.'</p> <p>Without such radical ideas there are fears farmers like Wood may be the last of their line. 'Who knows?' he shrugs. 'My lad lives and breathes the farm. He loves it. But can he afford to keep it on? That's a difficult one.'</p>",
  "<p>There is a decidedly retro feel to the sheepish return of GM to the UK. Like the transgenic crop version of a back-to-the-Nineties album, we find ourselves transported to the high emotions of a decade ago; Prince Charles kicking off on the radio and people in jumpsuits tearing up GM test sites (this time around a Leeds University potato trial). </p> <p>Pulling up GM crops is one very literal way of attempting to stay GM free, but it is ill advised. Apart from the criminal-damage issue, this type of direct action plays into the hands of the GM cheerleaders, who like to label any opposition Luddite or unscientific, which it is not. It is impossible to set out all the scientific arguments against GM here (for a summary see Forum for the Future's Five Capitals model, <a href=\"http://www.forumforthefuture.org/node/4625\">www.forumforthefuture.org/node/4625</a>). Suffice to say, a decade on from the outcry that effectively placed a moratorium on GM in the UK, many reservations remain, including the thorny issue of cross-contamination of non-GM crops. </p> <p>The most effective way to fight GM as an individual is via your shopping list, as it was last time, when the wholesale rejection of the Flavr Savr tomato (in which the rotting gene had been removed) meant that retailers soon lost their appetite for transgenic wares. </p> <p>Admittedly, this time it's more difficult. Last year a record 282.3m acres of the world's croplands were planted with GM soya beans, corn, cotton and other core GM crops, and some 90 per cent of conventional animal feed is thought to contain GM maize. This means it's easy to unwittingly support GM, especially through cotton, bioplastics (derived from GM corn) and processed food, meat and dairy. The best defence remains organic (GM ingredients are not permitted under organic standards), and meat and dairy from retailers - notably M&amp;S - that specify GM free. </p> <p>There is one departure from the Nineties debate: GM advocates are now citing the global food crisis as motivation. Strikingly, the biotech industry seems keen to play this down. As the chairman of Syngenta admitted to the Guardian recently, 'GM won't solve the food crisis, at least not in the short term.' </p> <p>But then it's not the job of transnational biotech giants to feed the world. Their job is to make money for shareholders - the combined market value of the two big rivals Monsanto and Syngenta now exceeds $100bn. A decade on, the point remains that just as Flavr Savr are not the only tomatoes, GM is not the only system for growing food in the future. In many ways it could be the worst, not least because it thrives on monocultures and threatens the very basis of our ecology. </p> <p>As physicist and campaigner against the privitisation of the world's croplands Vandana Shiva (<a href=\"http://www.navdanya.org\">www.navdanya.org</a>) puts it: 'In any crisis, uniformity is the worst way to respond; diversity is resilience.' You won't get diversity with GM.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:lucy.siegle@observer.co.uk\"><br>lucy.siegle@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>In a brightly painted room in Camberwell, south London, two 11-year-old girls are lying with their eyes closed, receiving a head massage. The expressions on their faces suggest they are about to drift happily off to sleep as Penny, the masseuse, continues her slow, rhythmic strokes. Perched on the end of the bed, nine-year-old Morgan and her friend are proudly showing me their newly painted fingernails - silver shooting stars drawn on little nails bitten down to the quick - and chatting about whether they prefer facials to manicures. </p> <p>While middle-class parents try to lure their pre-teen daughters away from nail polish and lipstick, fearing their little girls are growing up too fast, for some of these disadvantaged children the few hours they spend in the beauty therapy room at Kids Company's drop-in centre is a rare chance to be in a calm environment. It is also probably their only experience of being touched gently and lovingly or of being the focus of an adult's attention in a positive way. </p> <p>These children know all too well what it means to grow up too fast. The majority of the young people who knock on the door of the Kids Company centre asking for help do not have a functioning adult at home. Many of the parents are rendered incapable by drugs, some are abusing the children or permitting them to be abused in return for money or drugs. Some of the children appear in states of severe malnutrition and steal because they are starving. Most are not registered with doctors or dentists. </p> <p>From the excited faces of the younger children gathered here, you wouldn't guess that such bleakness framed their lives, a testament to the positive impact of Kids Company. It's also the last place you would expect to find the designer-clad figure of Kathy Phillips. Sylph-like in her tailored jacket and immaculate hair, Phillips is international beauty director of Vogue magazine. She's here to celebrate a most unlikely partnership: a range of aromatherapy products that she's created to raise money for the disadvantaged and damaged children who are helped by Kids Company. </p> <p>Kathy Phillips and Camila Batmanghelidjh, founder of Kids Company, make a wonderfully incongruous double act - Batmanghelidjh is a riot of colour in her turbans and flowing dresses - but their alliance will be invaluable to thousands of children. </p> <p>'The starting point was that Boots approached me about doing a mass-market range because they wanted something that was proper aromatherapy,' says Phillips, who already produces This Works, an award-winning range of aromatherapy products. 'I decided to call it Good Works, because it was going to be green and sustainable and because of the connection with This Works. Then I felt if we were going to use that name we really should be doing something good with it.' </p> <p>She could have chosen from any number of causes, but she had a friend who'd been working as a volunteer for Kids Company. 'I thought about what Camila was achieving here and I liked the fact that it was an unsexy cause,' she explains. 'People worry about donkey sanctuaries and children in Sri Lanka, when there are children here on their doorstep who need help.' </p> <p>Phillips initially didn't realise how well her idea would tie in with Kids Company's pioneering work in the use of massage therapies to treat disturbed children. First, she had to persuade Boots and the intermediary packaging and supply companies to take a hit in profits to fund the percentage given to charity - \u00a32 from every \u00a38 product, an unusually generous slice in the world of charity endorsements. So she didn't tell Batmanghelidjh of her plans until the infrastructure was almost complete, and it was only then she discovered the happy coincidence that massage was a central part of Kids Company's therapeutic programme. Now Batmanghelidjh takes over the story. </p> <p>'We'd have these boys lining up for massage, but some of them are so traumatised they won't allow anyone to touch them, so sometimes the therapist would have to do it over their Nike caps,' she says. She goes on to explain that all the complementary therapists who work at Kids Company (the centre offers massage, reflexology, cranial osteopathy and acupuncture, alongside psychotherapy) are supervised once a week by a psychotherapist. 'It's when the children are lying down that you see the cigarette burns, the belt marks. The massage therapists have to be prepared for this. And we tend to keep the appointments quite loose. If a child starts speaking or needs to fall asleep, we don't want to interrupt that. Many of them use it as an impromptu therapy session and for most of them it's their first experience of kind touch.' </p> <p>But raising money to pay for the therapeutic programme has proved difficult. Batmanghelidjh spends much of her time fundraising among City companies, many of which are generous, but occasionally she encounters prejudice. Every fresh newspaper story about a teenage knifing makes it that much more difficult to encourage firms to channel money in the direction of 'thugs'. Batmanghelidjh explains: 'One major organisation told me: \"Your kind of children don't look good on our annual report.\" And it's very hard to find funding for something like this programme, because it's not a building or an object that people can put a plaque on and say: \"We provided this.\" So when Kathy came along with this project I couldn't believe it.' </p> <p>Her struggle for funding is understandable; middle-market newspaper columnists would explode in indignation if government money were used to fund 'massages for muggers'. But those who would sneer at this project do so from an ignorance not just of the youngsters involved but also of the efficacy of complementary therapies, believe Phillips and Batmanghelidjh. </p> <p>'As a beauty editor you know that there's a percentage of people who think the whole thing's very superficial, very commercial, very empty-headed,' says Phillips, who is also a qualified yoga teacher. 'But further down the line you see how people are feeling better about themselves and how their performance has improved.' </p> <p>Batmanghelidjh is also aware of how the programme may be perceived by people who judge vulnerable children only by reports of their behaviour. To this end, Kids Company is collaborating on research with a number of university and medical schools into the effects of extreme neglect and abuse on the brain development of children. </p> <p>Batmanghelidjh shows me two MRI scans. In one of them there are large areas of empty space at the front of the skull. 'If no one interacts with you, the brain doesn't develop properly,' she says. 'So the brain of a three-year-old who has been severely neglected is smaller than the brain of a normal three-year-old. </p> <p>'The part of the brain that governs emotion and behaviour is underdeveloped, so these children can't calm themselves down. And they release vast amounts of adrenaline because they're terrified for long periods of time, so they're wired for emergency, they're like pressure cookers. They use cannabis to calm themselves, so we're looking at other ways of helping them do that. One of the most moving things is when you ask these boys: \"Do you feel calm when you hurt people?\", they'll say: \"My God, how did you know?\" Then you show them the brain pictures. I've had thugs cry - because for the first time someone has shown them what is happening to them and explained this thing that they've had no words for. So it's about equipping the children to take responsibility for balancing their energy and their emotions out, rather than just saying, \"Calm down.\"' </p> <p>Batmanghelidjh set up Kids Company in 1996 to combat the fallout from a system that was failing vulnerable children at an early age, leaving them prey to drug dealers and then blaming them when they ended up committing crimes. She estimates more than 500,000 young people ought to be on the Child Protection Register, 'and there is only capacity for 30,700. So at street level the drug dealers are perversely solving the social-care problems of these children. These are the things that we're not facing. We allow ourselves to describe children who present disturbed behaviour as \"young offenders\", then we can say: \"They made a poor moral choice.\" But if your brain chemistry is adapted for violence because of neglect or abuse, you don't have much of a choice. By labelling them criminals, we say the flawed morality is the child's and the rest of us get away with not facing our flawed morality in failing to help them. In my experience of working with these children for 11 years, none of them wants to be a criminal.' </p> <p>The good news, Batmanghelidjh continues, is that the damage to the developing brain can be repaired to a large extent by loving care, relationships of trust and the calming effects of the therapies. The results of the academic studies will be known in three years, and Batmanghelidjh hopes the science will change the way people view these vulnerable children and lend further support to her approach of 'robust love'. 'I want to be part of the solution rather than lock myself in a gated community and point from behind the bars saying, \"There goes the criminal!\"' </p> <p>In the meantime, the children tell me they can't wait to see the products on the shelves. 'They're really looking forward to going into Boots and seeing \"their\" products,' Batmanghelidjh says, beaming. 'It's a real source of pride that they can own this and feel that civil society is doing something to help them.' </p> <p>'I was surprised and very pleased about that,' adds Phillips, 'because I was afraid the children would feel patronised by the idea. But they've told Camila they'd really like their own spa.'</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Good Works will be available from Boots from September. Prices start at \u00a36</p>",
  "<p>Mary Beard says she has wanted to write about Pompeii for 'about 30 years', ever since she travelled there as an undergraduate with a passion for Roman archaeology. The old town has attracted its fair share of popular attention, from Frankie Howerd to Robert Harris, but rarely has it inspired the scrutiny of a classical scholar who confesses to a fascination with bad breath, Roman sex and 'the sheer puzzlement of it all. Where did they go to the loo in the amphitheatre?'</p> <p>And so, while Beard's new book on Pompeii on the eve of its destruction in AD79 has a sober subtitle - 'The Life of a Roman Town' - it will also introduce its readers to the boastful graffito scrawled on the wall of a Pompeii bar that claims: 'I fucked the landlady.'</p> <p>None of this will come as much of a surprise to those who have followed the obiter dicta of the classical world's most irreverent star turn. Mary Beard is a classics professor at Newnham College, Cambridge, the distinguished author of The Roman Triumph and Rome in the Late Republic, and a breezy feminist who, on a weekly basis, also writes 'A Don's Life' online for the Times Literary Supplement. The blog has a global following, with visitors in Swaziland, Afghanistan, Benin and Taiwan. She believes the Greeks and Romans would have 'loved the world wide web - this speed, this access and this extraordinary reach. Don't forget it took three months for a letter to cross the Roman empire'.</p> <p>On a good week, Beard scores a staggering 40,000 hits a day. Visit her site (<a href=\"http://www.timesonline.typepad.com/dons_life\">timesonline.typepad.com/dons_life</a>) and it's not difficult to see why. Recent postings include 'Let's get rid of the fascist Olympic torch', 'David Beckham's tattoos' and 'One-night stands'. She's also had a sharp exchange with Zadie Smith about Trajan's column and put the world straight on the reality of the Colosseum (it was sheep, not lions, apparently, and no Christians were put to death there). </p> <p>Variously described as 'maverick', 'dangerous' and 'wickedly subversive', 53-year-old Mary Beard (or 'Beard' as she refers to herself) is famously the don who, having recorded that the classical philologist Eduard Fraenkel was a notorious groper whose nubile prey included a young Mary Warnock and Iris Murdoch, merrily added that mixed with her sisterly outrage was 'a certain wistful nostalgia' for the 'erotic dimension of classical pedagogy'. So academic sexual harassment was OK? All hell broke loose. </p> <p>But the trouble this got her into with her bien pensant colleagues was as nothing to the reaction she got from her post-9/11 statement in the London Review of Books that, 'however tactfully you dress it up, the United States had it coming. That is, of course, what many people openly or privately think'. Again uproar, hate mail and obloquy. But Beard simply dusted herself down and set about replying to her postbag.</p> <p>That's the great thing about your full-blown classicist: for students of Homer, Ovid and Thucydides, there's nothing new under the sun. By the same token, the tall, witchily grey-haired, rather shambling scholar in academic robes who crosses the Newnham quadrangle to greet me on a dank vacation afternoon could have stepped from the cloister at any time in the last 2,000 years.</p> <p>It's probably the classics as much as her cheerful nature that makes the professor, on first encounter, not so much 'dangerous' as an angst-free zone, tough-minded and inwardly secure. Was this, I wondered, to do with growing up an only child? 'It was enormously good fun,' she replies, happily recalling her beginnings in rural Shropshire. </p> <p>She was born on 1 January 1955, the daughter of middle-class professionals. Her mother was headmistress of a junior school, her father an architect, 'an endearing public-school boy, you know, [pause] drunkard, [pause] you know. Jovial and clever'. When the family moved to Shrewsbury, which she remembers both as 'extremely exciting and slightly dull, especially if you were a sparky female teenager', young Mary found 'friends from many different age groups, and a slightly dangerous load of older men, most of whom,' she adds wickedly, 'are now safely dead'. There were plenty of 'scrapes', she admits. 'Playing around with other people's husbands when you were 17 was bad news. Yes, I was a very naughty girl.'</p> <p>At her direct grant school, Beard was the star pupil. 'I did Latin and Greek and I was very good at it,' she says matter-of-factly. At this point, she does that English amateur thing of affecting to treat her studies as a bit of a game: 'Never being much of a swot, with no interest in homework, I used to do a term's worth of unseen translations in the first week and have the rest of the term to myself.'</p> <p>As an enfant terrible with a good brain, she acquired a taste for risk. 'Beard's secret,' she says, 'is always to be slightly on the edge, but to pull back from disaster at the last minute. When the chips were down,' she goes on, 'Beard was happy to sit down with her unseen translations and get her As. So she learnt she could run with the hares and hunt with the hounds.' In the same spirit, she took up archaeology, which gave her the best alibi. 'People would ask, what's Beard going to do for her summer holiday, and you'd say something about a dig. Perfect!'</p> <p>She had plenty of models for provincial trangression, notably her sixth-form English master, Frank McEarchan, from Shrewsbury school, who took some of the clever local direct grant girls under his wing in the run up to the now defunct Oxbridge exam. Beard remembers that 'McEarchan was terribly influential. He taught us reams of English poetry, which we had to learn for financial reward. So it was 50p for Prufrock and some enormous sum (which he never had to pay out) for The Wreck of the Deutschland. Twenty quid, I suppose. Enough to get you to Greece.'</p> <p>'He'd probably be arrested nowadays but it was wonderful stuff. You had to stand on a chair - the Magic Chair - repeat the spell, \"Beware, beware, the magic chair\" - and recite poetry. Anything from Eliot to Bob Dylan.' Another volcanic laugh. 'I did so little science it's an embarrassment.' What else did she read? 'Loads of poetry and the novels of Margaret Drabble. You know: How we were going to go to Cambridge, and get pregnant and go into the BBC.'</p> <p>So who exactly was the Shropshire lass who applied to Cambridge in 1972? 'Well,' says Beard, 'she was terribly left wing. I remember plastering the kitchen with Black Power pictures of Angela Davis.' She toyed with King's, until she discovered that it did not offer scholarships to women. 'It wasn't until I got to Cambridge,' she says acidly, 'that I discovered active discrimination against women.' Today, however, she can laugh about the Roman epigraphy classes where her tutor would pose 'clever questions for the clever men and domestic questions for the dumb girls'.</p> <p>Cambridge made her a don. 'I became more of a swot - though a disguising swot, of course - I was very much a Newnham girl.' Student drama, music or journalism? 'Not a thing. I was wilfully unpromising. I didn't know any of the sexy people, didn't know Griff Rhys Jones. At 21, I was what you might call a bluestocking - with added sex.'</p> <p>Beard is still the 'disguising swot'. When she says: 'I've been bloody lucky with my jobs', she's leaving out a lot of hard slog. She refers, almost en passant, to getting married (to art historian Robin Cormack) and having two children, a boy and a girl, now grown up. The first time she was asked to write a review for the TLS, she thought: 'Gosh, how glamorous. It wasn't something I had thought of doing.' When family life kicked in, it struck her, she says, 'that book reviews are perfect for a woman with two kids under three who has no time for the big projects, but who wants to keep the intellectual wheels rolling'.</p> <p>Beard presents herself as a provincial outsider, but she was probably more in than she's letting on, because when her TLS mentor John Sturrock retired and she asked the editor Ferdinand Mount who would take over, Mount replied: 'We rather hoped you would come on board - would you?' It was a moment, says Beard, 'that was the making of me'.</p> <p>Well, not quite. What actually made her Britain's best-known classicist, and the approachable, slightly batty don the media turn to for quotations about Greece and Rome, was the furore about her response to 9/11. The weeks after the attack, she says, now in classical mode, were 'an intense moment of aporia. We were all over the bloody place. It was just not clear how language worked. I suppose my words got caught up in those extraordinary weeks.' </p> <p>'Today,' she concedes, 'I would put it differently. Now I would probably sound like the Archbishop of Canterbury.' But she's unrepentant. 'Yes, I do think I should have said what I said. That's what academics are for. Speaking their minds is what you want your poor little dons to do.' Beard's outspokenness got her noticed. When she was offered a blog by Guardian Unlimited, 'Peter [Stothard, the current TLS editor] said, \"You should do a blog for us.\" So I did. I was a complete tyro. I didn't ask myself, do I want to do a blog at all? It just took off.'</p> <p>Beard has been surprised by cyberspace. 'When I started, I thought, oh help. This is cheap, tawdry, debased form of journalism, blah blah. I have come to find that it's a hugely interesting form of journalism in the most surprising way. I can use the layers of the web to take people to places that would never appear in a broadsheet. For instance, I can give the English and the Latin texts of the Res Gestae. You can talk up, not down.' She enthuses about 'this incredible reach. What's exciting is the combination of this IT Leviathan with a sort of intimacy. My cynical colleagues will say, \"Beard, you're being naive. Think about the power relations. Where are the poor and the elderly on the web?\"' </p> <p>What else would her colleagues say about her? 'They would say,' she answers, smiling serenely, 'that I work incredibly hard.' Beard writes her classical blog late at night and checks her work in the morning before pressing send 'just in case I was too pissed'. She writes it on aircraft and in bars and says she has now found her own voice. 'I spend more time on it than I used to. I always go into the threads. You can't say, I write my blog and here it is, but then don't reply.' Pause. 'You have to engage.' Later, as we say goodbye, she adds mischievously: 'I also have up my sleeve a corker of a blog about all the things we get wrong about Pompeii, the number of brothels, for example ...

  "<p>If you have a slightly macabre cast of mind, you can entertain yourself by tapping into websites that predict the date of your own death. In the interests of research, I tried this out, and - wahay - the first one I go to, <a href=\"http://www.Livingto100.com\">Livingto100.com</a>, tells me I could last until 96, which means I'm not even middle-aged yet. But not so fast: <a href=\"http://www.Deathclock.com\">Deathclock.com</a> reckons I'll only reach 79, and it has an online ticker, counting down the number of seconds I have left (I'm not sure that its rating of my body mass index as 'desirable' quite made up for the trauma.) </p> <p>The serious side of this ghoulishness from a financial point of view is the discrepancy: a full 17 years. On an individual level, those possible years of extra life make a huge difference to when you might retire, how much you try to save, and your spending habits after 65. Economist Andrew Oswald found in research for Warwick University that people systematically underestimate their probable life span, and that of others, a mistake liable to lead to disastrously faulty planning. </p> <p>Increasing lifespans, and the difficulty of predicting mortality, are also a huge challenge for policymakers and pension funds. The problem is compounded by the fact that the rise in the number of oldies is accompanied by a low birth rate. The Office for National Statistics last week revealed that pensioners outnumbered children for the first time in the UK, and the trend for living longer is apparent across the developed world.</p> <p>There will be fewer people of working age to support legions of elderly people; economic growth is likely to slow; the costs of care for the aged and pension provision will rise. Financing the state pension - and public sector retirement benefits - will become a proportionately bigger burden on a smaller taxpayer base. Longevity is a key risk for firms running final salary pension schemes, many of which are already in deficit, but it is not at all clear that companies are taking account of this in a prudent way: the Pensions Regulator has delayed proposals to make schemes use more conservative mortality assumptions, which would add billions of pounds to stated liabilities, after coming under fire from industry groups. </p> <p>Obviously, we need to save more, but what else should we do? As John Llewellyn argues on page 10, it should be made easier for people to work for longer if they wish; employers need to adapt to an older workforce. Second, we should embrace immigration. Migrants have already shown the spirit of enterprise by coming here in the first place and provided they pay more in tax than they receive in welfare, they represent a benefit to society. Immigrants can also bring indirect economic gains by forming trading links with their home countries and creating cultural diversity.</p> <p>Young and middle-aged women are another possible source of workers to offset the growing number of dependant pensioners. Less than 8 million women in the UK work full time, compared with 14.6 million men, and 5.7 million are in part-time employment, compared with 1.8 million male part-timers. Women's participation in the labour force is lower partly because many choose to give up or scale back on their work to look after their families. But those who want the flexibility to combine a career with motherhood, or to return after their kids have grown up, still face unnecessary barriers. One thought that has not been introduced into the working mother debate so far is the thought that career women could save your pension.</p> <h2>No gold standard for Gordon Brown</h2> <p>Congratulations to Team GB, whose Olympics medal haul has surpassed expectations. Winning at Beijing is a priceless achievement, but as a bonus, gold medals are worth more thanks to the high price of the precious metal. It has come off a bit in recent weeks, but still stands at around $823 an ounce and most analysts believe it will be at least $1,000 by the new year. </p> <p>Gordon Brown should be feeling sheepish, though: he dumped nearly 400 tonnes, around half of the nation's reserves, on to the market between 1999 and 2002, at an average price of $270 an ounce. Accountant Maurice Fitzpatrick at Grant Thornton reckons selling at that nadir of the market, called 'Brown bottom' by cheeky gold traders, cost the UK \u00a32.8bn. </p> <p>So if you're a triumphant British athlete, don't stand too near the Prime Minister to receive his congratulations - he's liable to grab your gong and sell it at a discount.</p> <h2>Oil firms need a break. No, really</h2> <p>Suggesting tax breaks for oil companies is counter-cultural when Alistair Darling clearly needs the money, fuel bills are rising and environmental concerns are increasing - but I'm going to do it anyway. </p> <p>Oil and gas will be major sources of fuel and power for years to come, despite the growth in renewables. North Sea oil is important for the security of our energy supply and the balance of trade. Companies in the supply chain servicing the exploration and production companies also make a significant but unsung contribution to the economy, with world-class expertise in marine and undersea engineering. The top dozen companies in the sector had a combined turnover of \u00a34bn last year, made a significant contribution to exports, and employ 22,500 people in the UK. </p> <p>Between 16 billion and 25 billion barrels of oil and gas remain to be recovered from the UK continental shelf. Technological improvements and the high oil price make that a possibility. However, there needs to be a stable and conducive tax regime, or the oil companies will look for easier options. And unless companies invest in new projects to make use of the infrastructure, it will be decommissioned.</p> <p>The offshore oil and gas industry is taxed at 50 to 75 per cent, and while it should not be allowed to enjoy windfall gains on a national asset, it would be self-defeating and short-termist if the fiscal environment deters investment that could prolong production. Since the Seventies, governments have failed to make the most of North Sea oil; unlike the Norwegians, we have no sovereign wealth fund to show for it. But we should not squander the remaining potential by leaving billions of barrels under the sea, unused - and untaxed. Tax incentives need to be highly targeted, but there is a good case for them.</p>",
  "<p>New figures from the United Nations to be released this week are set to reveal that opium production in the southern regions of Afghanistan has soared. The worst affected province is Helmand, where 7,000 British soldiers are deployed.</p> <p>Officials are likely to stress successes in the north and east of the country, where the number of provinces free of poppy is set to rise. Last year 13 provinces across the country were declared free of opium cultivation - largely in the relatively secure north.</p> <p>However, there are fears that extreme hardship caused by drought and long-standing deep poverty in the newly poppy-free zones may threaten that progress.</p> <p>'In the north, where there is a degree of legitimate government and political leadership, poppy production has been dropping,' said Christina Oguz, representative in Afghanistan for the UN Office on Drugs and Crime. 'But the severe drought after a harsh winter means that, if we are to sustain the downward train, much more needs to be done.'</p> <p>Oguz said it was critical that the Afghan government and the international community 'show that they will ensure food supplies and massive and targeted long and short-term development' areas where farmers decided not to plant poppy last year. 'I am not sure that is going to happen,' she said in an interview in Kabul.</p> <p>Recent improvements in the eastern province of Nangarhar, once a major growing area, are also threatened. Last year local and central government persuaded farmers and tribal elders not to plant poppies and promised development projects.</p> <p>'We did not plant opium last year because the government banned it and said we would get dams, roads and jobs,' said Zarjan Adalkhel Shinwari, a local elder. 'People are wavering. We need the money and none of their promises have been fulfilled. But it is illegal.'</p> <p>Planting usually starts in October. In the 2006-2007 season, Afghanistan produced 8,200 tonnes of opium, a record.</p> <p>A second worrying development is the growing 'professionalisation' of local drugs production, with mobile laboratories increasingly manufacturing high-quality heroin within Afghanistan. Previously, opium was turned into heroin outside the country. 'Most of the labs which were round here have gone down to the south,' said Shinwari.</p> <p>In Helmand province, the extension of agricultural land that has been the result of recent development work has allowed further opium production. </p> <p>However, the poppy harvest has been affected by a glut on the market which has lowered the price paid 'at the fa rm gate' and high global wheat prices which have made other crops more attractive.</p>",
  "<p>In a country where public discussion of sex remains taboo, but where a wet sari scene is regarded as an essential part of a Bollywood movie, the job of the censor was never going to be an easy one.</p> <p>But India's moral guardians appear to have lost patience with three of the country's most popular television channels, accusing them of violating strict broadcasting guidelines and prompting a national debate over censorship and how far the country is prepared to let standards change.</p> <p>The networks' crimes were diverse; MTV India was hit with what is known as a 'show cause' notice for allegedly denigrating women in its reality show Splitsvilla, while news channel IBN-7 was accused of 'encouraging superstition' by reporting that the gods Lord Ram and Hanuman had appeared in a ball of fire in Malaysia. Meanwhile, Headlines Today, another news channel, raised hackles for celebrating the 62nd anniversary of the invention of the bikini in a report branded 'objectionable and indecent'.</p> <p>All three have been given 15 days by the government's Information and Broadcasting Ministry to justify their actions. If their explanations are not accepted, they could be taken off the air or forced to run grovelling apologies on screen. Last year a fashion channel was temporarily closed down after it was judged to have stepped over the line.</p> <p>Opponents of censorship are bewildered by the arbitrary nature of the bans. Praful Bidwai, a political commentator and human rights activist, said the Indian state was naturally prone to censorship. 'Their motto is, if in doubt, ban it,' he said. 'It is outrageous in some respects, but the bureaucracy is so bloody-minded. There is a lot of prudery and hypocrisy in this society. Until a few years ago even a kiss was banned in Indian films, and there was a commission of inquiry to decide whether kissing was part of Indian culture.'</p> <p>India has a contradictory attitude to sex and religion. Bollywood is all gyrating hips and seductive dances, with the wet sari scenes that leave very little to the imagination a must for many directors; pictures of scantily clad women and smouldering men adorn the pages of the daily papers. At the same time, religious imagery is ubiquitous and no car on India's roads is complete without a handful of icons on the dashboard.</p> <p>Yet when television channels showed footage of the actor Richard Gere kissing Bollywood and reality TV star Shilpa Shetty in public last year, they were accused of committing an obscene act in public and effigies of the pair were burnt in the streets.</p> <p>The latest clampdown comes at a time when reality TV shows have never been more popular in India. The Indian version of Big Brother - Bigg Boss - is drawing huge audiences. And despite - or maybe because of - India's reticence on the subject of sex, there is no question that the shows are deliberately pushing the boundaries. MTV's Splitsvilla show was certainly never going to win any prizes for good taste. The publicity shot for the show features two bare-chested hunks, bound in thick ropes and surrounded by a gaggle of nubile young women in various states of undress. One appears to be brandishing a riding crop. </p> <p>Every week the women do battle for the attentions of the men, strategically deploying whatever assets nature has bestowed on them as they seek to gain the upper hand, whether that means belly dancing or giving the men a rub down in the hot tub. 'Splitsvilla - where love is war,' the slogan says, but it is the government that has now declared war on the show.</p> <p>TV critic and media commentator Shailaja Bajpai said the notices issued to the channels were laughable. 'They think you can't have a woman on air looking like she's thinking about sex or might enjoy it,' she said. 'But the contradictions are something no one can reconcile.'</p> <p>She said the problem was exacerbated by the lack of an independent regulator. 'Everyone is very against censorship but we don't have an independent body to adjudicate,' she said. </p> <p>She suggested that the television channels were complicit in the current set-up and that they and the government favoured the status quo. 'You get the ministry coming out with these completely absurd judgments, banning them for a month and making them stand in the corner. But a non-regulated environment suits the channels too.'</p> <p>Not everyone is upset by the ruling, though. Even Bidwai acknowledged that the television channels were their own worst enemies. 'Some of these channels are not doing a good job of reporting,' he said. 'When it comes to exaggerating the lurid aspects of a story, they can border on the pornographic.'</p>",
  "<p>When London Mayor Boris Johnson receives the Olympic flag from his Beijing counterpart today, it will mark the beginning of a four-year golden journey culminating in the London games.</p> <p>Golden, that is, for some of the world's richest tycoons and companies. With a public sector budget pot worth \u00a39.35bn, there is plenty to play for. </p> <p>The anticipation of a financial windfall from the London games was so great that international property barons had already laid claim to their medals immediately after the International Olympic Committee awarded the event to London in July 2005.</p> <p>Quickest off the mark were the low-profile billionaire Reuben brothers, who made their fortune in the murky waters of the Russian metal industry following the break-up of the Soviet Union. The Reubens, together with Multiplex, the troubled firm that built Wembley stadium, and Westfield, the world's biggest shopping centre developer, owned the development rights around Stratford station - land on which key Olympic facilities will soon be built.</p> <p>The Reubens, after a protracted and acrimonious tussle with their partners and former London Mayor Ken Livingstone, sold their strategic land holdings two years ago. Following what were described as tense and sometimes explosive negotiations, some suggest the Reubens emerged with a clear profit in excess of \u00a3100m.</p> <p>With the Reubens installed as the London Olympics windfall sprint champions, the way is clear for the principal Olympic-zone landowners to take the long-distance medals.</p> <p>Australia may have conceded defeat in the race to overtake team GB in the Beijing medals table, but its biggest property companies are well placed to clean up in the business blue riband event for being top economic beneficiaries. Many Olympic insiders reckon gold in this event is set to go to David Crawford, the chairman of giant Australian developer Lend Lease. Pushing him all the way is Westfield founder Frank Lowy.</p> <p>Lend Lease was awarded the development rights to a huge area in and around Stratford, east London, two years ago. This includes building and financing the troubled Olympic village project at more than \u00a31bn. </p> <p>Lend Lease, which has been pulling out of UK town-centre projects as the property market plunges, has found it hard to get bank backing for the project. This has resulted in an increased contribution from the Olympic Delivery Authority. It is understood Lend Lease and its financial backers are putting more than \u00a3600m into the project, with \u00a3400m coming from taxpayers. </p> <p>Some argue Lend Lease has used the credit crunch as a way of 'de-risking' the village project. But sources close the firm insist it is contributing in excess of \u00a3250m, which amounts to a major commitment on what will be a difficult project from which to make money.</p> <p>But the Olympic village represents a fraction of Lend Lease's interest in Stratford. It is committed to another 4.5 million sq ft project to be built after the games, which will include more housing, offices and hotels with a potential value of \u00a33.5bn.</p> <p>Lend Lease's project, overseen in the UK by respected real estate figure Nigel Hugill, will benefit from the huge scale of improvements and prominence coming to what has for the past 10 years been an up-and-coming part of the capital.</p> <p>Lend Lease's potential Olympic windfall may ultimately eclipse the one that could go to Westfield's Lowy, the Jewish-Hungarian emigr\u00e9 who settled in Australia after the war. Lowy persuaded the Olympic Delivery Authority to hand over what is understood to be in excess of \u00a3100m to ensure that a 2 million sq ft shopping centre next to Stratford station in east London is open in time for the main event.</p> <p>The money is going into key infrastructure associated with the mall, which has already secured John Lewis, Waitrose and Marks &amp; Spencer as key tenants. Property sources say Lowy has pulled off a master stroke. 'This centre was already going to be built,' said one. 'Lowy is being given money for something that was already going to happen.' </p> <p>A Westfield spokesman downplayed the idea that it has directly benefited from the games. He insisted that the company, which in the next few weeks will open a major new mall at White City in west London, is risking \u00a31.5bn to build the shopping centre. It is also building a new ticket hall at Stratford station, as well as contributing to a combined heat and power system which will supply the Olympic facilities.</p> <p>Both the Olympic Delivery Authority and Westfield refuse to reveal how much money Lowy has received but The Observer understands that Culture Select Committee members will push ODA officials for an answer on the issue.</p> <p>Other major firms expected to secure handsome profits from the games include project manager CLM, which is a consortium of firms that includes CH2M Hill, Laing O'Rourke and Mace. CLM is on a performance-related contract based on hitting key targets. As things stand, the 'Big Build' is ahead of schedule so the consortium is on track to scoop a substantial share of the \u00a3600m programme management budget.</p> <p>Carillion, led by John McDonough, has won the \u00a3300m-plus contract to build the Games' huge media centre, in a joint venture with regeneration fund Igloo. If it can find a tenant to take over the state-of-the-art facility once the Games have finished - ITV is known to have been approached - the deal should prove particularly profitable, especially in the light of speculation that the ODA will be making a substantial contribution to the costs of construction. The ODA would not comment on the rumours.</p> <p>The construction industry will also benefit from the expected addition of 12,000 new hotel rooms; London's hotel market already has 130,000 rooms spread between 1,600 operators. Tourism leaders are readying themselves for a \u00a32.2bn windfall in London and, nationally, a projected \u00a32.9bn.</p> <p>This has led to protests that the rest of the country outside London will miss out on tourism revenue. But some industry figures believe Olympic spectators will extend their UK stay. </p> <p>There is an expectation that national sporting bodies, representing in particular cycling, swimming, sailing and rowing, will get significant tranches of money from the private sector following the success in those pursuits at Beijing. And sport science businesses will find their services more in demand as UK sport bodies gear up to ensure athletes reach their full potential for 2012. </p> <p>The operator of the aquatic centre has not been chosen yet. But the favourite to win the contract will be GLL, the biggest operator of municipal leisure facilities in London. GLL is a social enterprise, a business with a social mission, and winning the contract would be a significant boost for the sector as a whole, which is championed by both Gordon Brown and Tory leader David Cameron. There is, however, concern that an operator needs to be chosen quickly so that it can be part of the design process for the facility.</p> <p>The other beneficiaries ought to be east Londoners lucky enough to own their own homes. Since the bid was won in 2005, house prices in the Olympic boroughs of Waltham Forest, Newham, Tower Hamlets, Hackney and Greenwich rose faster than other parts of the capital. They have also fallen less in recent months. The downside is that many are priced out of home ownership in some of the poorest areas of London.</p> <p>But, according to the ODA, the games will 'transform an area previously contaminated and derelict into one of the largest new urban parks in Europe for 150 years'.</p> <p>The original reason to bid for the games was to catalyse the building of 40,000 much-needed homes and raise horizons for areas that today make the news because of teenage gun and knife crime. Achieving this will be an Olympic challenge worthy of a gold medal.</p> <h2>Fears for the losers</h2> <p>The Olympics will see London win at the expense of the rest of the country. Areas outside London could lose as much as \u00a34bn in economic activity, according to some estimates, as money pours into the capital.</p> <p>Being awarded the games triggered a flurry of infrastructure cash for London after years of vacillating by Labour and Conservative governments. The green light was given to the \u00a310bn Crossrail project and extensions to the East London and Docklands Light Railway lines. The Olympics will also see additional road upgrades.</p> <p>Complaints have been aired about the possibility that the Olympics will suck money out of grassroots sport. Many clubs currently receiving Lottery funding fear they will lose out to the Games. The Treasury could remedy this by ensuring the UK's 40,000 community sport clubs are eligible for tax breaks, such as business rate relief and gift aid. Such a move could see up to \u00a3400m of cash flow back into sport.</p> <p>There are also concerns that small firms will miss out on supply contracts. Culture, Media and Sport select committee member Paul Farrelly is angry that a company based in his north Staffordshire constituency in the Potteries lost out on a contract to make ceramic mugs for the games. Ironically, it was given to a Chinese firm. </p> <p>Ensuring the greatest show on earth goes off without a hitch is the relatively easy bit. Ensuring east London and the rest of the country experiences tangible economic and social benefits from the Games is the true test of whether all the investment has been made wisely.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Chunky Move: Mortal Engine</strong> <br>Edinburgh Playhouse </p> <p><strong>Rosas: Steve Reich Evening </strong><br>Edinburgh Festival Theatre</p> <p>Two highly challenging dance works at the Edinburgh International Festival last week looked in some ways quite similar - throbbing, minimal music, small groups of contemporary dancers trying to create new relationships between sound and movement - but they had diametrically different impacts. One felt like an assault, the other almost painfully cerebral.</p> <p>Australian dance company Chunky Move gave the European premiere of its work <strong>Mortal Engine</strong>, which uses digital technology and infra-red-sensitive cameras to create dazzling and disturbing effects of light and movement. I can't begin to explain the technology, but it's obviously all very cutting edge, created by a German computer engineer whose video cameras follow the dancers' movements, apply algorithms to them in real time (in the space of a 50th of a second, apparently), then use these to create lighting effects around them. </p> <p>The upshot is that the light becomes the predominant performer, pulsing and retreating, forming grids and circles, thudding across the raked stage, then breaking into particles. The barrage of light waves creates an otherworldly environment in which the dancers' bodies seem shadowy, beautiful and vulnerable.</p> <p>Gideon Obarzanek, Chunky Move's director and choreographer, also collaborates on this work with a 'sound and laser artist' who is a former heavy metal drummer with a PhD in electro-acoustic composition. And, like the lights, the electro-acoustics are not what you could call unobtrusive. Yet there's a paradox here: despite the reliance on technology, the implied faith in its ability to deliver what human beings want, the emotional effect of Mortal Engine is dystopian. </p> <p>The dancers' bodies make shapes suggestive of scuttling spiders, fumbling sea creatures or lonely human beings trying to make contact with one another. The light follows and preys upon them, breaking them apart, splintering them into shards or reducing them to shadows as the technology creates its own heedless world, in which the evolution of organic things seems to have only a marginal place.</p> <p>This feels scary. Sound and light seem physically to invade the audience, who watch helplessly as the dancers struggle and fail to make lasting connections in near darkness or piercing white light. And it all takes place to the accompaniment of insistent electronic beeps and crackles or, at one point, horror-movie sucking sounds, as of a body deliquescing and becoming a blob of protoplasm. </p> <p>Mortal Engine is an undeniably thrilling work, extraordinary to look at and exciting in its sense of possibility. For all his fascination with technology and the apparently abstract qualities of his choreography, Obarzanek has a strong feel for narrative and the emotional weight of dance. This is a great quality, but, in this work, it is also troubling. Watching a permanent state of struggle and flux turns out to be exhausting.</p> <p>The<strong> Steve Reich Evening</strong>, from Brussels-based company Rosas, is, by contrast, cool and austere. Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker, Rosas's founder and choreo grapher, has been fascinated by Reich's music for more than a quarter of a century. Here, with the group of performers collectively known as Ictus, she presents her interpretation of seven of his works. </p> <p>It is understandable that Reich has inspired de Keersmaeker (and several other choreographers): the overlapping rhythmic patterns of his work, repeating, desynchronising and counterpointing, have an energy that is almost primitive. This is most apparent here in Drumming Part 1, a world premiere, where four bongo drums played with sticks create a visceral pulse of a kind to which human beings must have danced in all times and all places.</p> <p>At the same time, Reich's music is so finely patterned and complex that it demands a sophisticated choreography. The subtle differentiations in the repetitions mean that timing is everything, and precision is at a premium. Sure enough, the dancing here is impeccable. Reich has commended de Keersmaeker on her understanding of his music, and her choreography is capable of communicating meanings in his work to the audience; the fluidity and coherence of the compositions is more apparent, to me at least, when her dancers are moving to them.</p> <p>That said, the dancing, like the music, can be wearingly austere and rigorous, with much of the movement feeling quite constrained. In Piano Phase, two dancers do little other than step, turn, swing their arms and clench them round their waists as they move in and out of synch. Their shadows on a backdrop merge and split, so that there seem to be three figures moving, then four. </p> <p>The patterns are pure, fluid and prompt meditations on time passing. The choreography isn't passionless, in other words, but seeking out the passion requires a degree of application. I wasn't altogether surprised that a man next to me fell asleep.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Observer's For the record column, Sunday August 31 2008</strong></p> <p> In the article below, we referred to Tom Bradley's 'unsuccessful bid for the governorship of Los Angeles'. Los Angeles has a mayor, not a governor. Bradley, who was mayor from 1973 to 1993, ran unsuccessfully in 1982 and 1986 for the governorship of California. This has been corrected</p> <p> </p> <p>Standing next to his street stall of glassware in downtown Denver, Jim Butcher was delighted that Barack Obama and the Democrats were holding their convention in his city this week.</p> <p>He hoped to make a killing selling his wares to the 50,000 visitors, including 15,000 journalists, who are descending on Colorado's state capital. But Butcher, who is a registered independent, did not intend to vote for Obama in November.</p> <p>'I think, at the moment, I am going for [John] McCain,' he said. Asked if there was anything Obama could do this week to persuade him to change his mind, Butcher quickly replied: 'Not really. Not much chance of that.' </p> <p>The reason, he said, was Obama's lack of experience. When asked, he said his decision had nothing to do with the colour of the candidate's skin: 'I don't care about his race.' Then he added a rider that will dismay those who watch with mounting anxiety as McCain steadily gains ground on his Democratic rival for the White House: 'There might be some people who do.' </p> <p>This week's events in Denver are fast turning into a critical moment in Obama's bid to be America's first black President. What was once seen as an anointing of his candidacy is becoming a chance to right a campaign facing a series of unexpected crises.</p> <p>The Democrats are starting to struggle in a presidential race which they should be dominating. America is beset by economic troubles, mired in an unpopular foreign war and facing an unpopular Republican party. A stunning 80 per cent of Americans think that the country is heading in the wrong direction. Yet Obama and McCain are virtually tied in the polls. The possible explanations are multiple. The Democratic campaign is being daily assaulted by withering Republican attack ads. At the same time, there are still deep scars in the party left by the ferocious battle between Obama and Senator Hillary Clinton. </p> <p>And then there is the issue of race. It gets much less attention than the battle with Clinton, or the daily barbs traded with McCain, or Obama's struggle to rise in the polls. Yet it might provide the key to understanding the strange inability of the Obama campaign to achieve lift-off in the polls. </p> <p>'The question of this election is race. The answer we are looking for is, how much will it matter?' said Professor Shawn Bowler, a political scientist at the University of California at Riverside. America will soon find out. When Obama speaks on Thursday to more than 80,000 people in Denver's football stadium he will also reach a television audience of millions of Americans. They will look into the face of a man who could be their next President and for the first time it will be a black face. </p> <p>By the end of this week, America will finally be facing up to the question that might truly define the 2008 presidential race: is America ready to elect a black President to the White House?</p> <p>Obama's speech will take place in the most historic of circumstances. On the 45th anniversary of Martin Luther King's famous 'I have a dream speech', delivered at the height of the civil rights struggle, Obama will face an adoring crowd to whom he will preach a message of unity and change. 'It is hard to overstate the historic nature of this speech,' said Professor Seth Masket, a political scientist at Denver University. </p> <p>There is no denying Obama's campaign resembles King's lofty ideals. King spoke of a dream where '... my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the colour of their skin but by the content of their character.' Certainly, Obama has consistently portrayed himself as 'post-racial'. His bid for the presidency has avoided race unless forced to do so. That happened once, when comments made by Obama's former pastor Rev Jeremiah Wright threatened to derail his campaign. Obama responded with a well-received speech on race in Philadelphia that was an attempt to lay the issue firmly to rest.</p> <p>Afterwards, the campaign redoubled its efforts to portray Obama in the terms of America's history as a melting pot of different ethnicities: black and white, and everything in between. That is going to be writ large at Denver in a carefully packaged message. Each day has a 'theme' designed to appeal to the middle ground. They range from 'One Nation' to 'Renewing America's Promise'. At key moments, Obama's life story will be fleshed out with an emphasis on his bi-racial history, such as having a white grandfather who fought in the Second World War. During his final speech, Obama will be surrounded by 10 ordinary Americans he met during his campaign. Denver will paint an all-American picture of Obama as an everyman figure, defying pigeonholing.</p> <p>That is a laudable aim and politically astute. It is also difficult. For the fact of race is always present. It is hard to imagine the Obama phenomenon if he were a white politician. Then he might just be another one-term senator from Middle America with a gift for oratory and little experience. But Obama's mixed racial background and its deeper meaning propels him to a different level. It also makes it harder for him to avoid addressing the issue of race. </p> <p>But America itself is often engaged in the same experience; not talking about race even though everyone is thinking about it. The polls certainly seem to suggest that some white Americans do have a problem with Obama. </p> <p>His popularity is huge among blacks and strong with Hispanics and young white voters. Yet his support struggles among older white voters, including many Democrats. Among Clinton Democrats, one fifth say they are backing McCain rather than Obama. It may be these voters care about 'experience' or other issues more than black or Hispanic or young voters. Or it might be that they are simply resistant to voting for a black man to be President, whether they know it or not. Whatever the truth, securing a decent percentage of the white vote is going to be fundamental to Obama's hopes.</p> <p>In research published in New York magazine, the pollster Thom Riehle, who founded the AP/Ipsos survey, calculates that even if the black turnout were to rise by 25 per cent from 2004, with Obama gaining a 92 per cent share, and significantly more Hispanic voters and under-50s voted for Obama than voted for Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry in 2004, he would still need to win 40 per cent of the white vote - just one point less than Kerry got. As Riehle points out: 'This is a daunting task as the first black candidate for President. To get there, he's got to win roughly the same proportion of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents that all other Democrats get. If he doesn't he's in a world of trouble. He can't win it just by changing the electorate.'</p> <p>The polls themselves may be unreliable. In the past, support for African-American candidates when Americans actually cast their votes has often failed to reflect what voters told the pollsters. Most notoriously, former Mayor of Los Angeles Tom Bradley, in his unsuccessful bid for the governorship of California, came up short in a manner no one could have predicted having followed his poll ratings. American pollsters now talk about the Bradley effect.</p> <p>There is little doubt that race is going to play a starring role in this election after the convention season. 'It has not been too much of an issue so far. Or, at least not talked about. But that is not going to last,' said Bowler. It is already getting a lot of play on conservative talkshows and in books. Rush Limbaugh, the 'shock jock' who is hugely popular with white conservatives, has stepped up race-baiting on his broadcasts. He recently claimed Democrats chose Obama as a sort of 'affirmative action' programme. 'I think it really goes back to the fact that nobody had the guts to stand up and say no to a black guy,' he told his millions of listeners. Warming to his theme a few days later, he said: 'You can't criticise the little black man-child.'</p> <p>Slightly more subtly has come a series of anti-Obama books. The most strident, and most popular, has been The Obama Nation, by Jerome Corsi, who helped mastermind the Swift Boat campaign that derailed Kerry in 2004. Corsi described Obama as having Islamic links and a Muslim past. He wants him to be seen as a scary 'Other', just like some black leaders have always been portrayed. Even the title of the book has that effect: said quickly 'Obama Nation' rapidly becomes 'abomination'. That is not likely to be an accident. </p> <p>Obama frequently warns against such attacks, acknowledging they are covertly linked to his skin colour. 'What they're going to try to do is make you scared of me ... You know, he doesn't look like all those other Presidents on those dollar bills,' he told one rally. Obama is right. Nor are such attacks going to let up. Many Republican strategists believe the Wright controversy will reassert itself. Though Obama has disavowed Wright, the preacher's black nationalist theology is still going to be fodder for anti-Obama ads. They may not come from the McCain camp itself, but from shadowy groups allied to the Republican cause. Either way, the effect will be the same. </p> <p>No matter how much Obama - and millions of other Americans - seek to take race out of the election, there will be others wanting to bring it back. McCain's campaign has even accused the Obama camp itself of playing the race card, thus cleverly injecting the issue right back into the debate. </p> <p>It was a tactic that even some on Clinton's campaign sought to use. Leaked memos from her campaign revealed that her top strategist, Mark Penn, tried to get Clinton to paint Obama as un-American. 'I cannot imagine America electing a President during a time of war who is not at his centre fundamentally American in his thinking and his values,' Penn wrote in one memo. Penn is likely to have meant Obama's father's Kenyan background. But it is hard not to see some, perhaps unintentional, subtext of race. Would he have written such words if Obama's father had been Irish, and not black African?</p> <p>Clinton did not take Penn's advice, but Democrats still bear the wounds of the battle Clinton and Obama fought. That divide will be on full display in Denver. Clinton herself has been given a prime speaking slot. More controversially, so has her husband, Bill Clinton, who still damns with faint praise when it comes to Obama. Then there is the fact that Clinton's name is going to go forward in a symbolic first roll call on the convention floor. Delegates and superdelegates will be asked for their vote and estimates vary about how many will vote for Clinton. It could be as high as 1,200. This piece of political theatre was an olive branch by Obama's campaign as a way of appeasing Clinton's passionate backers. It is intended as a visible way of uniting the party. That may work. Or not.</p> <p>Larry Johnson, an intelligence consultant, runs a pro-Hillary blog. Even now, he pulls no punches when it comes to Obama. 'It is becoming clearer that he is the wrong candidate at the wrong time,' he said. </p> <p>Even if the party is healed, there are other minefields ahead in Denver. First off are the legions of protesters. They range from anti-war marchers, to environmentalists, to anti-globalisation organisations. The Denver police are also taking no chances. A complex of special holding cells - dubbed 'Gitmo on the Platte' after Denver's South Platte river - has been constructed. For a candidate desperate to ease the concerns of middle America, any violence would be a PR disaster. It would also be a moment for the Republicans to pounce and they, too, will be in Denver. Just a few blocks away from the convention hall, they have set up a media war-room, serving up stars of the Republican firmament such as Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney. Nothing, it seems, is going to be easy in Denver this week.</p> <p>The Denver convention has gone from a coronation to a challenge. 'This is tricky. He wants to leave the convention with the party as united as possible,' said Larry Haas, a political commentator and former aide in the Clinton White House. Polls last week showed Obama's lead over McCain narrowing to just a few points. One, a Reuters-Zogby survey, even had McCain with a lead of five per cent. McCain, with his new aggressive strategy, is now settled into the 'happy warrior' mode. He is the insurgent underdog taking chunks out of a more favoured opponent. Yet such an analysis is unfair to Obama. A study of the electoral coalition shows just how narrow Obama's margins of victory are. His levels of support among blacks, Hispanics and young voters are already squeezed close to their likely maximum. </p> <p>In order to win in November he undoubtedly needs to persuade white, working class and elderly Americans to back him in much greater numbers. McCain needs to keep them away. That alone will ensure that the issue of race cannot remain underground. For, in the heat of the fight ahead, it could actually become the main battlefield itself.</p>",
  "<p> <em>Atari 800 home computer</em></p> <p>Gamasutra has published the second installment of Steve Fulton's history of Atari, the pioneering games company. In 20 pages he covers <a href=\"http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3766/atari_the_golden_years__a_.php?page=1\">the golden years</a> from 1977 to 1981, where the highlights include a range of coin-ops, the Atari Video Computer System (or 2600), the Atari 400/800 line of personal computers, and games such as Space Invaders, Asteroids, Centipede, Tempest and Star Raiders.</p> <p>The Atari 800 was a fantastic machine architected by the late Jay Miner and others, who later repeated the concept to create the Amiga 1000.</p> <p>IBM thought about buying the Ataris as the basis for its entry into the home computing market, but Atari's owner, Warner Bros, had already sabotaged the machine. As Atari founder Nolan Bushnell says:</p> <blockquote> <p>Warner ... said, 'Not only are we not going to help third-party developers, we're going to sue you if you use our operating environment.' So everybody that wanted to get into the software business supported Apple over Atari. So basically Warner drove the coffin nail in the Atari 800, despite it having a clearly superior chipset, a better operating environment... We had a lot of innovations in the Atari 800 that became standard later on.</p> </blockquote> <p>There's obviously a lot of wishful thinking in that: the Apple II (1977) owned the market well before the Atari 800 appeared, and the 800 lacked expansion slots. Another thing that didn't help was the huge success of Doug Neubauer's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Raiders\">Star Raiders</a> game, which was pretty astonishing for its time. People bought Atari computers just to run it. But as Fulton says:</p> <blockquote> <p>Of course, the success of Star Raiders had a serious downside for the Atari home computer division: it solidified the industry misconception that the 400 and 800 were not serious computers.</p> </blockquote> <p>The story has an amusing quote from Activision co-founder <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Crane_(programmer)\">David Crane</a>, of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Computer_People\">Little Computer People</a> fame:</p> <blockquote> <p>Atari had contracted with a young programmer named Bill Gates to modify a BASIC compiler that he had for another system to be used on the 800. After that project stalled for over a year Al [Miller] was called upon to replace him with another developer. So, while Al is the only person I know ever to have fired Bill Gates, I suspect that rather than work on Atari BASIC, Gates was spending all his time on <a href=\"http://www.patersontech.com/Dos/\">DOS</a>* for IBM.

  "<p>Two boats being sailed by international peace activists on a mission to defy the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip and deliver humanitarian aid reached their destination today.</p> <p>Hundreds of Palestinians gathered to greet the group of 46 activists, who undertook the two-day journey despite Israel saying it would stop the mission, which it described as a \"provocation\".</p> <p>Earlier today, Israel said it would permit the boats to dock in Gaza after determining that they were carrying humanitarian equipment.</p> <p>Those on board accused officials of sabotaging their communications equipment.</p> <p>The mission is intended to challenge the economic blockade imposed by Israel and deliver a cargo of 200 hearing aids for a deaf school and 5,000 balloons. </p> <p>The activists on the boat included an 81-year-old Catholic nun, the British journalist Yvonne Ridley and Lauren Booth, the sister-in-law of Tony Blair.</p> <p>\"I've been nervous, but I'm excited,\" Booth said shortly before the boats sailed. \"It's not about our fear, it's about the people waiting in Gaza - you can't think about anything else.\"</p> <p>Another passenger, Huwaida Arraf, a Palestinian with Israeli and US citizenship, said: \"The siege that the Israelis have imposed on Gaza is not only illegal in terms of international law, it is also immoral. </p> <p>\"Global institutions and the governments of the world know what is happening and are not doing anything about it.\"</p> <p>Yesterday, Aviv Shiron, a spokesman for Israel's foreign ministry, had said \"all options\" were under consideration to prevent the boats from reaching Gaza. </p> <p>An Israeli admiral issued an apparent warning to all shipping to stay clear of waters near Gaza because of an unspecified \"security situation.\"</p> <p>A standoff with the Israeli navy and the arrests of the activists if they tried to enter Gaza had been expected.</p> <p>In a statement issued as they departed yesterday, the activists said they would lodge a legal protest against any attempt by the Israelis to arrest them. </p> <p>\"If Israel chooses to forcibly stop and search our ships, we will not forcibly resist,\" a statement said.</p> <p>\"If we are arrested and brought to Israel, we will protest and prosecute our kidnapping in the appropriate forums ... it is our purpose to show the power that ordinary citizens have when they organise to stand against injustice.\"</p> <p>Although Israel withdrew its soldiers and settlers from Gaza in 2005, it still controls the strip's air and sea space as well as almost all the border crossings. </p> <p>Until a recent ceasefire with Hamas, the Israeli military was mounting regular incursions into the strip, saying it wanted to stop rocket fire into southern Israel. </p> <p>It has imposed a tight economic blockade of Gaza, saying it wants to weaken Hamas, the Islamist group that won Palestinian elections more than two years ago.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama's decision to make Joe Biden his running mate has divided opinion among commentators.</p> <p>Many regarded the Delaware senator as an obvious choice following the focus on world issues brought about by the conflict in Georgia.</p> <p>His appointment has been backed by the Virginia governor, Tim Kaine, who was also in the running for the vice-presidential nomination.</p> <p>\"I am very excited that Senator Obama has selected Senator Biden to be his running mate,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Senator Biden is a tremendous leader and a great complement to Senator Obama and his candidacy. </p> <p>\"He has worked as a committed public servant, has a proven track record and understands the complex challenges facing our nation.\"</p> <p>The Huffington Post <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/earl-ofari-hutchinson/mccain-not-obama-picked-v_b_120779.html\">commented</a> that \"McCain, not Obama, picked VP Biden\".</p> <p>It said Biden's foreign policy expertise made him Obama's obvious choice after the Democratic campaign was criticised by McCain as being \"inexperienced and naive\" on overseas issues.</p> <p>\"McCain repeated the points about Obama, mantra-like,\" it said. \"He was too untested on foreign policy issues, and too inexperienced and green to fight the terrorism battle and to be hard nosed enough on national security.\" </p> <p>The US news website TwinCities.com <a href=\"http://www.twincities.com/politics/ci_10280818\">warned</a> that \"Biden's own worst enemy may be his own record\", referring to his comments last year that Obama was \"not ready\" to be president. </p> <p>The article said Biden had accepted $5,133,072 in contributions from lawyers and lobbyists since 2003, whereas Obama does not accept contributions from federally registered lobbyists. </p> <p>It also highlighted Biden's close ties with credit card companies as a topic ripe for attack by the McCain camp.</p> <p>Juan Cole, president of the Global Americana Institute, <a href=\"http://www.juancole.com/2008/08/biden-as-vp-candidate.html\">congratulated the senator on his appointment</a>, saying he had been impressed by Biden's grasp of Middle Eastern politics. </p> <p>Responding to those who have pointed out Biden's tendency to commit verbal gaffes, Cole said: \"We have had a president for nearly eight years who has committed almost nothing but gaffes, every day, all day. </p> <p>\"The corporate media typically forgive Bush for this and don't even often bring it up. Why is it that it is an issue for Biden but not for Bush?\"</p> <p>The BBC blogger Justin Webb <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/justinwebb/2008/08/biden_a_necessary_antidote.html\">put the choice of Biden down to the recent focus on Georgia</a>. </p> <p>\"Joe Biden is Vladimir Putin's contribution to American politics - he is a necessary antidote to the Obama lack of worldly wisdom,\" he wrote.</p> <p>John Boehner, Republican leader in the House of Representatives, said: <br>\"Americans looking for a pair of candidates who are ready to fix a broken Washington aren't going to find them on the Obama/Biden ticket. In Joe Biden, Barack Obama has not only found a running mate who doesn't believe he's ready to be president, he's proven his opposition to an 'All of the Above' energy reform strategy to lower fuel costs for families and small businesses.\" </p> <p>But Dick Lugar, the senior Republican on the Senate's foreign relations committee, said: \"I congratulate Senator Barack Obama on his selection of my friend, Senator Joe Biden, to be his vice-presidential running mate. I have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with Joe Biden to bring strong bipartisan support to United States foreign policy.\" </p> <p>The Leftcoaster <a href=\"http://www.theleftcoaster.com/archives/013038.php\">has voiced its support for Biden</a> as someone who can fill in the gaps in the Democratic campaign. </p> <p>\"Biden brings experience, feistiness and boatloads of foreign policy seasoning that Obama sorely lacks, and Biden knows more about sensible foreign policy than McCain, Tom Ridge, Tim Pawlenty, or Mitt Romney will ever know themselves.\"</p> <p>Rick Klein, a political analyst at ABC News, said Biden <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Vote2008/story?id=5637409&amp;page=1\">will be the \"experienced yet still energetic inside player\"</a> to Obama's \"fresh-faced voice of change\".</p> <p>However, he warned that \"picking Biden also sends a stark signal that the Obama campaign is worried that the presidential nominee is in danger of flunking the commander in chief test\".</p> <p>The 65-year-old's appointment as vice-presidential nominee has knocked Obama's popularity, according to bookmakers. </p> <p>Following the latest polling data, the bookies have lengthened Obama's odds on replacing George Bush from 4/9 to 1/2. McCain has been shortened to 6/4 from 7/4. </p> <p>\"It is not looking as good it was for Obama,\" the Ladbrokes spokesman Robin Hutchison said. \"At this point, we still expect him to win - but it could be a much tighter race.\"</p>",
  "<p>Channel 4 controller <strong>Julian Bellamy</strong> has said that the broadcaster would not have aired last week's scenes of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/aug/19/jade.bigbrother\">Jade Goody</a> being <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/aug/19/jade.bigbrother\">told that she had cancer</a> while in the Indian version of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/bigbrother\">Big Brother</a>.</p> <p>Bellamy also said that someone should \"shoot me\" if he joined the classic show remake bandwagon and considered reviving Channel 4 shows such as <strong>Fifteen-to-One, TFI Friday or The Tube</strong>.</p> <p>Despite the UK version of the long running reality show having been criticised for incidents, most infamously the Celebrity Big Brother race row last year involving Goody, Bellamy said today at the <a href=\"http://www.mgeitf.co.uk/home/mgeitf.aspx\">MediaGuardian Edinburgh International Television Festival</a> he thought that airing the scene in the Diary Room when she was told she had cancer and her reaction would be beyond the pale for Channel 4.</p> <p>Talking about Goody's dramatic departure from Mumbai-based Bigg Boss, Bellamy said: \"I thought it was extraordinary and sad. It is an impossible question to ask. No, no [we would not have aired it]. I haven't seen it although I know it has been broadcast [in India].\"</p> <p>Bellamy also said that there was a danger of \"overkill\" with the recent trend of commissioning new versions of classic TV shows.</p> <p>\"While some have been brilliant, like <strong>Doctor Who</strong>, there is a little bit of a danger of overkill. The creative lifeblood of TV should be about trying to find the next big thing,\" he added.</p> <p>Classic shows including <strong>Gladiators, Blake's 7, The Prisoner and Minder</strong> have, or are being, re-invented for modern TV.</p> <p>\"I can understand why [classic shows are attractive] - they are less risky, there is a little bit of a path of least resistance,\" Bellamy said.</p> <p>He added that there was \"no chance\" that Channel 4 would head down the same route. \"I think, honestly, shoot me if I try to bring back Fifteen-to-One, or TFI Friday or The Tube\".</p> <p>Bellamy also denied that he was going down the \"shock docs\" route with shows such as <strong>Embarrassing Illnesses, Half Ton Mum and Perfect Vaginas.</strong></p> <p>\"They play a relatively small part of the company's output. Everything in moderation,\" he said.</p> <p>Bellamy added that Embarrassing Illnesses was a \"pretty gritty public service issue fused with fantastic entertaining factual telly\".</p> <p>Commenting on the success, or otherwise, of other Channel 4 shows he admitted that <strong>Dumped</strong> had failed because it \"didn't have the human narrative you need... [it was] a little bit too like other reality shows\".</p> <p>Bellamy also defended the airing of the <strong>Great Global Warming Swindle</strong>, for which Channel 4 was censored by Ofcom after complaints, remaining defiant.</p> <p>\"Channel 4 should be a place where marginal, alternative, non-conformist views are broadcast to a mainstream audience,\" he said.</p> <p>He was also quizzed over whether Channel 4 had lost its edge, the risk taking attitude that characterised the broadcaster's early years.</p> <p>Bellamy argued that Channel 4 had not stopped taking risks, but that society as a whole was more difficult to shock.</p> <p>\"Was it easier to shock people, break taboos, in the 1980s? The answer is yes,\" he added.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>Alan will be here from 2.00am...</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Preamble:</strong> Like a bumper sack of Christmas presents, Beijing has held us rapt for the best part of a fortnight now, but there's still some fun to be had at the 29th Olympiad. <strong>Wee Tom Daley</strong> will be showcasing the talent that British football missed out on in the diving; <strong>the good doctor Tim Brabants</strong> is off in the kayaking at 8.30am - prescription: more gold; there'll be a further chances to cover ourselves in relay glory with some <strong>4x400m baton juggling for both the men and the women</strong> in the Bird's Nest; and <strong>Lisa Dobriskey</strong> will attempt to add to <strong>Team GB's pot o'gold</strong> in the 1500m. There's also a bauble up for grabs in the men's footie, so I'm told. All of which means another glorious date in MBM history, folks - why not be a part of it? Go on. Please...</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>2.10am:</strong> Have you read the preamble? Ah, you have. Well ... Did I mention the football? That's on in a couple of hours. Alright, three. Currently, all I can enlighten you about is women's handball and men's hockey - 7-8th and 11-12th classification matches, respectively. I know, you're on tenter hoo... yada, yada.</p> <p>Still, handball, eh.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>2.15am:</strong> It's 1-1 in that crucial fight for 11th place in the hockey. China and South Africa are scrapping for the honour of finishing bottom and not-bottom. I'm not really sure about the handball, other than that Sweden and Romania are the nations doing the handling...</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>2.25am:</strong> Huzzahs! We've got some yelpin' 'n' kickin' over in the Beijing Science and Technology University Gymnasium (BSaTUG). Malaysia's Chew Chan Che has just bashed seven bells out of Uzbekistan's Evgeniya Karimova in the Taekwondo women's 67kg preliminary. The BSaTUG crowd loved that.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>2.30am:</strong> Thirty-two medals up for vending today, the second busiest of the Games. Not that you'd know it right now. Ecuador - Australia up next in kick-scream-dance-fall over. Taekwondo combatants look a bit like rappers about go head to head in a battle, to me, bouncing back and forth on the balls of their feet before ATTACK, ATTACK, ATTACK. Gangsta rap's probably less violent though.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>2.37am: Word from our BBC spies.</strong> \"The Beeb reports that the 'pageant of Britishness' we will be treated to tomorrow is set to feature none other than a Privet Hedge!\" says 'Grey Squirrel' Oliver Pattenden. \"What more appropriate way is there to welcome the entire world to enjoy our culture, than to present them with the staunchly vigilant and rather stoic shrub we employ to tell everyone else to mind their own business.\" Yes, a shrubbery, that's what we want. Will there be some curtain-twitching too? And maybe some lessons on the Empire - may its sun never set...</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>2.43am:</strong> The Taekwondo-ers (proper name, anyone?) are stalking each other like two ginormous, springy preying mantises (manti?). Aus have kicked ass, and the victorious girl is being led off by an attendant with a flag, presumably to her quarter-final fate. Cue some cheesy Europap in the stadium...</p> <p>Brazil v Greece next.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>2.50am:</strong> Has anyone else noticed the egregious use of ear-bleed dance music in the various stadia in Beijing? It's as if the organisers got sent a crate load of Sash, DJ Otzi, et al, and told \"this is what Westerners like...\" 0-0 after the first round in the Taekwondo.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>2.53am: Wee Tom Daley's off in the Water Cube soon</strong>, although even he doesn't rate his chances: \"I don't think I'll get anywhere near a medal.\" Glad I'm up for this then. Moments of the Games, people? Daley throwing the evil eye Blake Aldridge's way after their synchronised bombing...?</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>2.58am:</strong> It's bright and sunny in the 'jing as Clare Balding kicks of the Beeb's coverage for the morning. \"If Taekwondo were a movie, it would be called 'Carry On Screaming'.\" Arf, arf. <strong>Team GB's Sarah Stevenson</strong> is your one to cheer for today. And, with all the fuss about Wee Tom Daley, I forgot to mention that <strong>Pete Waterfield actually qualified 4th for the diving semis</strong>... so maybe he is worth staying up for.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>3.03am:</strong> Daley says \"Brilliant!\" more often than the character called <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/fastshow/characters/brilliant.shtml\">Brilliant from the Fast Show</a>. And Leon 'Holy Moly' Taylor - Waterfield medal-winning partner from Athens - has got a mic in his hand and, unfortunately, he's not afraid to use it.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>3.06am:</strong> I'll be relying on the steady hand of Bob Ballard to guide us through this, because I have absolutely no idea what the jings is going on - and Taylor is about as helpful as brail.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>3.11am:</strong> Now that's a question: commentator of the Games? Hugh Porter from the cycling? Gary Richardson for his stalwart interviewing/interrogating? Jackson and Johnson doubling teaming - in a nice, clean way - up in the athletics tower? This is one that could rumble on and on... (MBMer plants riff, shuts his eyes, and hopes it will grow)</p> <p><strong>Team GB</strong> Tom Daley has just flipped his way into the pool like a young Jimminy Cricket to score 71.40 for his first dive.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>3.15am: Team GB</strong> Pete Waterfield's abs have just chucked themselves off the board. \"That's the best three and a half pike we've seen,\" gurgles Taylor. Three nines give Waterfield 81 points and second place... until some Russian geezer gets 88 one jump later and leapfrogs his way to the top.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>3.20am:</strong> Daley's in 15th, but there are five rounds still to go. Taylor reckons seventies won't cut it, though. Even if you \"look like an angel and dive like a swallow\". Not my words, Clare Balding's. Excuse me while I scratch my head for some time.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>3.23am:</strong> My tip here is to look for the splash on entry into the water (I lied earlier when I said I knew nothing - this is \"Britain's most popular newspaper website\"* after all). The bigger the splash, the lower the score. But then, as you're reading about the diving, rather than watching it, I guess such pithy wisdom is wasted on you. Gah.</p> <p>*copyright: Big Paper</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>3.25am:</strong> A Belorussian nearly brains himself on the platform as he dives, and then Daley's up again. And I have to retract my mocking of Balding (surely not in the running in our broadcaster awards - nudge, nudge), because that was certainly swallow-like. Only 3.0 difficulty though, so those eights are only worth 72 to Wee Tom.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>3.30am:</strong> More sage advice for the ingenu diving-watcher: you don't want to get a bit \"banana man\" when you hit the water, says Taylor. Bending = bad, then. But if you throw up \"naff all\" splash, like the Chinese diver just did, then you're doing alright. See, solid Rebranded Website advice backed up by Chief Diving Wonk, Leon Taylor.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>3.33am: Team GB</strong> Wakefield, whose abs you could probably play skiffle on, is suffering with injections in his shoulder, but he manages a hand-stand before plunging pool-ward. Not so point-worthy this time - just 72 for Abs Waterfield.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>3.35am:</strong> Predictably the Chinese are first and second. Abs is 9th with Wee Tom down in 16th. Only the top twelve go through to the final later today.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>3.40am:</strong> Venezuala are getting another kicking over in the Taekwondo. <strong>Team GB's Stevenson</strong> will be getting her yell on in about 10 minutes. Plenty of splish-splosh back at the diving, with a Canadian athlete whirring like a Roman candle on his way down. The suicidal Belorussian makes too much splosh this time, so no big score for him.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>3.43am: Wee Tom goes with 3.2 difficulty this time...</strong> and it's good, coos Taylor. Apparently, even though Wee Tom didn't hit the water quite vertical, he used his skill to keep the splash down. What a champ.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>3.46am:</strong> China's Huo Liang is that good that Taylor's forced to bring out his chuckle. This kid is running away with it - and we're only in the semi.</p> <p><strong>Sarah Stevenson, Britain's best-known Taekwondo athlete</strong> - truly some distinction - has trooped out onto the mat. She has a tough draw against Jordan's Nadin Dawani, though.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>3.50am: Team GB</strong> Waterfield notches a solid 70. He should be good for the final at this rate. Stevenson slaps a foot into the Jordanian, and she's 2-1 up after round one. She's been given one of those half penalty points though.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>3.51am:</strong> Having said that, Waterfield is only 12th... and he's keeping Wee Tom, who's 13th, out of the final currently.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>3.54am: Jingoism jingle.</strong> \"I'm sure when I went to bed at close of business last night the GB Super Team had just been overtaken in the medal table by those uber-scary, dark and menacing Ruskies,\" Jerusalems David Lloyd from Beijing. \"It's odd that 2 weeks ago we'd all have given anything to be doing as well as are now, and yet I now find myself even more urgently refreshing the Guardian blog just to ensure that we remain in 3rd ahead of those troublesome, lesser little sporting nations such as Russia. Anyway, any idea where this 18th Gold of ours suddenly materialise from?\" <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/23/olympics2008.olympicscanoeingandkayaking\">This</a> should suffice, David.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>3.59am: Team GB</strong> Don't worry, those Russians have got no chance. \"Phenome-Tom\" has just bashed 86.40 out in the diving, and Sarah Stevenson has scrapped her way into the next round of the 67kg Taekwondo. TEAM GB! TEAM GB! TEAM GB!</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>4.03am:</strong> It certainly is noticeable how expectations have changed in the last week. As we've crept up the table, we've become less and less concerned with putting in a good effort, and more about beating those Aussie/Ruskie/German b*stards just below. In the interests of managing expectations, though, I should point out that Sarah Stevenson's reward for yelling louder than her opponent in the Taekwondo is a shout-off against the reigning Olympic champion.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>4.05am: Team GB diving</strong> Waterfield nails his effort as well, picking up a cool 90 points. Looking good for Abs, despite his being \"an old man\", according to motormouth Taylor.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>4.09am:</strong> Let's raise that bar, fellow Bulldogs. What's one more former colony between sporting rivals? Or, as Oliver Pattenden puts it: \"What do you mean we've become more concerned with beating the bastards below? USA's not that far away you know.\" Yes, yes... and Uncle Sam has been pretty feeble this time around. They'll be on their knees by 2012, surely...?</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>4.13am:</strong> Taylor and Ballard are prattling on like a pair of washerwomen. Abs and Wee Tom are 7th and 9th after the fourth set of dives - two more to go, I think. Taylor is definitely the most annoying speakbox the BBC have chosen to employ - even more so than Hyperactive Matt 'HOIME' Baker.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>4.14am:</strong> Daley picks up nines for a score of 89, and Taylor is getting all bombastic. He... thinks... if... he... speaks... slower... it... makes... him... sound... more... author-ta-tive.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>4.20am</strong> \"I never thought I'd say this but we have to be thankful for an Aussie gold - pole vaulter Steve Hooker beat Evgeny Lukyanenko and kept the Russians below us on the table.\" So says a Pommie Barsteward from northern Straya. And he's <a href=\"http://results.beijing2008.cn/WRM/ENG/INF/AT/C92A/ATM072000.shtml\">right</a> you know - the last medal of Friday. Abs has just made a RIGHT RICKETT of his dive!!! Taylor groans like it's enema time. Fours for our boy...</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>4.25am: Team GB diving</strong> Daley's in 6th now, but Waterfield has plummeted to 13th. He's just four points behind the guy in 12th, so all is not lost... but he's made a rod for his own back there.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>4.28am:</strong> It's 1-1 between Japan and the puny US - the only country to stand between us and China at the top of the medal table - in the baseball. You'd think with exclusive access to the 'World Series', the Yanks might do a bit better, really.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>4.31am: Wee Tom wrinkles his nose like a church mouse</strong>, but that dive should be good enough. Only 60-odd... but Ballard reports that the little tyke has a 'Q' by his name, so he's definitely qualified. Splendid.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>4.34am:</strong> We're getting to the crunch now, dear reader(s). Can baldy Pete 'Stock Aitken' Waterfield make it through...?</p> <p>Football final soon. Argentina (current champeens) v Nigeria (who won it in 96). Grrrr</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>4.37am: Ballard reckons Waterfield needs mid-eighties...</strong> the 3.8 degree of difficulty results in a bit of a splash. He's scored 76, but this is the sharp end and that mightn't be good enough.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>4.40am:</strong> And do you know who the Super Eagles beat in Atlanta? Yup, twas the Albicelestes. Should be a good one, this. Things not looking good for Waterfield, meanwhile.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>4.42am:</strong> Tough break for Waterfield, he misses out by less than six points, finishing 13th. Wee Tom, the cheeky little blighter who's charmed us all*, finished eighth, and is through to this afternoon's final. He dived well, snide giggling aside, and kept his composure despite being right on the cusp going into that semi.</p> <p>*If he hasn't charmed you in particular, kindly keep it you yourself, like a good patriot</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>4.50am: The Germans, another nation straggling in our glorious wake, have picked up gold in the women's cross country cycling.</strong> Russia collect a meaningless bronze. You need GOLDs now, Uncle Vanya, y'hear? We're back to the hinterland of obscure Olympic events now. It's a choice of Taekwondo, Table Tennis repeats, or... Team GB hockey's titanic struggle for 5th against Korea. I'm torn.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>4.55am: It's Chiles play over in the National Stadium.</strong> Time for the football, ladies and gents. GB 0-0 Korea, in the men's hockey, if you're in. Opinions on the man redefining ubiquitous, Adrian Chiles?</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>5.00am:</strong> Plenty of Premier League interest here, with Javier Mascherano in blue and white and Victor Anichebe, who missed an absolute sitter in the semi, on the bench for Nigeria. The Everton striker did <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=zdm8tIgNXrY\">score in the group stage though</a>. Barca's Lionel Messi should be the star of today's show however.</p> <p><strong>GB 2-1 Korea in the hockey.</strong> Whoop whoop!</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>5.05am:</strong> Decent penalty shout for Sergio Aguero, but that would have been harsh on Nigeria. Sublime ball from Messi to set the Atletico Madrid striker through.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>5.07am:</strong> Argentina have settled quickly, but Nigeria have a free-kick some 40 yards out. \"Has Chiles redefined 'ubiquitous' to mean 'underwhelmingly mediocre'?\" Ollie Pattenden with that poser. Keeper saves comfortably for Argentina.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>5.11am</strong> Nigeria aren't too shabby on the ball themselves, but Riquelme and Messi are seeing plenty of the play. Great run from Di Maria before he's brought down on the edge of the box... Riquelme drifts a disappointing effort over though.</p> <p>It's now 3-1 in the hockey, by the way.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>5.14am:</strong> Nice interchange on the right of the area, but Okoronkwo can only blaze well over. Bit more composure required there, reckons Leroy Rosenior.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>5.17am:</strong> Gago and Mascherano are happy to break up play and look for their team-mates breaking ahead of them. Mad Masch plays a delightful dink into the right channel... only for it to bounce of the back of Riquelme's head. Doh</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>5.18am:</strong> Messi sidesteps on the edge of the 18-yard box, but the Nigerians close him down and he can't find Aguero. Seconds later, Aguero is denied by a brilliant sliding challenge as he attacks the box from the left.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>5.20am: Team GB hockey</strong> The Brit lads are tearing Korea apart, Jonty Clarke adding a fourth and his second. 4-1</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>5.22am:</strong> Okoronkwo almost finds the delightfully-named Promise Isaac in the box, but a position of more than a little promise comes to nothing. Argentina look menacing, but are yet to have a clear sight of goal.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>5.25am:</strong> As the sound of the brass band floats across the stadium Messi sidles his way into the area again... and is brought down, surely. The ref's having none of it though.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>5.27am:</strong> Looped cross from Ebenezer Ajilore and Odemwingie can only send his header onto the roof of the net. More good work from the African side, as Victor Obinna lashes one from distance. Straight at Romero between the Argentinian sticks.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>5.30am:</strong> I think it's 4-2 in the hockey at half time. And Nigeria were one well-executed back heel from playing Obinna through one-on-one. Odemwingie thens crashes a bit of a sighter wide of the right-hand upright.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>5.33am:</strong> They're all having a drink now, which seems a bit village green. And we're back...</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>5.36am:</strong> Aguero takes a superb touch in the area, but is adroitly ushered away from goal. Nigeria look pretty well-marshalled at the back to me.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>5.38am:</strong> Oh... Oooooh! Odemwingie powers past his man and drills a ball across the face of goal, which no one can get a touch on. The ball is cleared, but then returned to the goalmouth and Isaac is surprised to find it ricochet off his body and safely into Romero's arms. A simple tap-in, that's how Leroy Rosenior saw it.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>5.41am:</strong> Nigeria are having their best passage of play and Argentina's superstars can't get a foot on the ball. But will they live to rue that miss from Isaac?</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>5.44am:</strong> Aguero's cross nearly finds Di Maria at the back post, but it's successfully, if a little streakily, cleared. Mascherano then booms a 30-yarder vaguely in the direction of the goal.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>5.48am:</strong> We've got a bronze medal match between China and Cuba in the women's volleyball underway elsewhere, as well as plenty of Taekwondo. <strong>Team GB's Sarah Stevenson</strong> went through earlier, and you can read about it <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/23/olympics2008.olympicstaekwondo\">here</a>. In the fussball, Ambruse Vanzekin just manages to tip Di Maria's drive around his post. Nearly caught out there, was the Nigerian keeper.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>5.50am:</strong> Bit of Argie-bargie between the sides as the half-time whistle goes. An excellent block from Dele Adeleye prevented Argentina getting near the goal moments beforehand. All square, 0-0.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>5.56am:</strong> Unnervingly media-savvy Tom Daley looks Bob Ballard in the eye, winks, and admits that he's \"brushed away some of the cobwebs\" with that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/23/olympics2008.britisholympicteam3\">semi-final performance</a>. Selected soundbites thereafter: \"Everything's been good [in Beijing] times ten...\"; \"Anything can happen in an Olympic final...\"; \"[Pete Wakefield] should have been in that final but it's unfortunate that he didn't dive that well...\" [pulling no punches there]; \"I'm going in hoping for a really good performance, but not expecting anything...\" Well, good luck to the wee bairn, of course. TEAM GB! and all that.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>6.06am:</strong> Still waiting for the lads to come out for the second half. 8-4 to the US in the baseball, the Americans homing in on the bronze.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>6.10am:</strong> Vanzekin bravely denies the onrushing Aguero as we get back underway. This could be decide by just the one score, as happened four years ago.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>6.14am:</strong> Messi drives left-footed across the goal from 25-yards, forcing Vanzekin to punch away. Obinna then becomes the first player in the referee's book for a clumsy challenge on right-back Ezequiel Garay.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>6.16am:</strong> There's a real African atmosphere inside the National Stadium, according to the boys from the Beeb. Argentina clearly have a bit more finesse about them, but Nigeria are hustling and harrying well.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>6.19am:</strong> Leroy Rosenior is stretching the impartiality a bit here. Still claiming he didn't see the Messi penalty from the first half. Argentina probe again, but there's a bit of a lull to proceedings currently.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>6.20am: GOAL! Nigeria 0-1 Argentina</strong> After all that, a wonderful finish breaks the deadlock. Messi splits the Nigerian back line and Angel Di Maria sprints through and then produces a sublime chip to defeat Vanzekin, who probably came off his line to early. Great strike still.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>6.25am:</strong> The Nigerians look a little stunned by that goal, and have retreated into their shell. Messi's twinkling around the danger area... but it's the Super Eagles who have the next effort, Obinna dribbling a shot straight at Romero. Time for Anichebe.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>6.27am:</strong> And Anichebe nearly makes a decisive first touch! Great low cross from the right, and the Everton striker's effort is bundled around the post from close range. The corner leads to nothing.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>6.30am:</strong> Yellow card for Onyekachi Apam as he clatters Di Maria. Riquleme's whipped strike from the dead ball is deflected off for a corner.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>6.34am:</strong> Just under 20 minutes for Nigeria to conjure something or it's going to be second-place silver. John Allen in Singapore is looking at Benfica's Angel Di Maria with his most optimistic hat on: \"Blimey, that was a delightful finish from the lad. I wonder if Leicester City have sent the scouts along. Here's hoping.\"</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>6.36am:</strong> Di Maria's obviously heard that Leicester might be looking at him... he's just been booked for tugging back an opponent.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>6.38am:</strong> Drama in the Argentina penalty area as both Odemwingie and Ekpo fail to get a touch on the ball as it squirts in front of goal. Messi then does his thing at the other end and almost plays in Aguero... and Pablo's Zabaleta's cross is scrambled away by Vanzekin moments later.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>6.41am:</strong> Kaita's snap shot flies just over, but the keeper hasn't had to work for that. Jose Sosa replaces Aguero for the Albicelestes.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>6.45am:</strong> It's getting a little niggly, both Monzon and Riquelme booked for time wasting. Nigeria look like their luck's run out here.</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>6.47am:</strong> Romero makes a crucial block from Anichebe, who's been a nuisance in the box since coming on.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>6.50am:</strong> Angel Di Maria has been stretchered off, apparently due to the heat. This one's winding down and the Argentinians are only too pleased. Both teams seem pretty drained.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>6.53am:</strong> Messi scoots off with the ball and then wins a free-kick deep in Nigeria's half. We're into added time... of which there will be five minutes! Where's that come from? Still hope for the Africans.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>6.58am:</strong> Okonkwo balloons one high and wide, but there was little on for the Nigerian. And Lavezzi wins a free-kick right in the corner for the South Americans... the ball's been pumped long though. To no avail. We're over 95 minutes now.</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>7.00am: Argentina win the gold medal</strong> and they did enough to retain their Olympic title. Messi, whom everyone agrees was the difference between the sides, looks pretty chuffed - but Chilesy is not happy with the amount of Mexican waves going on in the stands. Tsk, lugubrious Baggies, eh...</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>7.03am: We won the men's hockey 5-2 as it turned out.</strong> It was coming up to full time when I thought things were only halfway through. Fifth place and all the glory that comes with it to Team GB. Stunning.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>7.10am:</strong> Well folks, there's another day of BOUNDLESS GLORY ahead for Team GB.<strong> The good doctor Brabants is next on the card in the K1 500m</strong>, although he's not off for about an hour. <strong>Lucy Wainwright</strong> will be going for metal of some colour in the women's event. We've also got <strong>Oliver Beckingsale and Liam Killeen</strong> in the men's mountain biking. Some <strong>4x400m</strong> shenanigans later on too. Thoughts and digressions, guardianistas, please.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>7.20am:</strong> Hungary are 15-14 up against Korea in the women's handball bronze medal match. And China have snaffled another medal, bronze this time, in the volleyball, seeing off Cuba.</p> <p>John Allen's still mulling the possibility of Argentinian match winner Angel Di Maria turning out for the Foxes, meanwhile: \"Di Maria better be back at the Walkers for our game against Tranmere this afternoon. And Singapore TV has gone back to ping pong, it doesn't get much worse than this.\"</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>7.25am:</strong> Handball appears to a cross between American football, basketball, and rugby. I have no idea how the rules work. I can however watch instant replays of eveything by virtue of the fact that the BBC's web feed is a bit behind Eurosport's coverage. Double confusion. Hun 18-17 Kor</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>7.28am:</strong> 18 apiece now. So far, I'd say it's not as fun to watch as volleyball, which can be brilliantly bananas, but a fair bit better than dressage, which seems an incomprehensible waste of a horse's good time. Lot's of running into each other... and then BAM!, the Koreans hit the post.</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>7.30am:</strong> Korea whack one in off the crossbar, but the Hungarians pull things level... only to fall behind and then equalise again. Norway and Russia will contest the gold medal match at 8.45am. Go Norway!</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>7.34am:</strong> John, our man in Singapore, has joined me in ignorance. \"We're onto the women's handball here now. I haven't a clue what is going on, mind you, but I just can't handle any more table tennis! Does anyone know the rules? All I can figure out for myself is that jumping is encouraged.\" Jumping does certainly seem to be encouraged. It's one of those sports where the teams continually trade the advantage, too, indicative of a fatal (boring) flaw in the scoring system, I say. Kor 22-22 Hun</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>7.40am:</strong> Submissions for most baffling sport of the Games? Handball is vaguely confusing, but I think it can be beaten. I have no idea how a lot of the gymnastics is rated; judo seems fairly bewildering too. Korea have sneaked ahead 26-25... but Hungary have a penalty, which looks a lot like a free goal to me. 26-26. Hockey? That has some weird rules.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>7.44am:</strong> Apart from the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/aug/23/olympics2012.olympics20082\">army of buffoons doubtless preparing for tomorrow's caper</a>, there's sod all appears to be happening in Beijing. Well, there's probably some human rights being oppressed somewhere too*. One of the Koreans has just floated a deft lob over the keeper... but it's off the post. And there also appears to have been a couple of sending-offs. Kor 29-27 Hun</p> <p>*This is mere idle speculation and not a statement of fact</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>7.49am:</strong> Hungary are hurting from that double two-minute suspension I mentioned earlier - yes, I did - and they've slipped to a three-point deficit. The Koreans can smell that rusty third-place medal... 30-27</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>7.52am: Bamboozled by Beijing.</strong> Welcome to the MBM Barry Hawthorne, who provides a welcome distraction from the handball. \"I know you Brits are really good at that Velodrome stuff, but what are the rules concerning that pursuit race? Why do they have to play a 'cat and mouse' race?\" Hmmm, well, I think it's mainly because if one of 'em goes charging off, they'll get knackered pronto, and lose, Bazza... Personally I found the Madison more difficult to work out. And we didn't come up with the goods in that one.</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>8.00am:</strong> I think the Koreans won that 33-28. It became a bit of a blood bath at the end. <strong>Bronze goes to Korea, then.</strong> After such a MASSIVE, MASSIVE game, I am well and truly spent. Luckily, I can pass on the baton, in best Team GB style, to the one and only Mr Barry Glendenning. And be warned, <strong>don't get him started on nouns being used a verbs...</strong></p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>8.01am:</strong> [brief and unedifying scrabble on the floor for MBM schedule and preparatory notes ensues]</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>8.09am:</strong> Good morning everyone. Alan's correct - you won't hear the word \"medal\" used as a verb on my watch. I think I saw my colleague Sean Ingle commit this crime against literacy in the newspaper yesterday or the day before and he'll be feeling the back of my hand when he gets home from Beijing, unless the Chinese government intern him and all the other journalists who've been committing it in \"re-education camps\" for a couple of years. The only Briton I can think of who's \"meddled\" in the Far East in recent years is Gary Glitter, and the less said about him, the better.</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>8.27pm:</strong> Sorry about that. I've just been fielding a phone call from Sean Ingle. Imagine how much longer it would have been if he'd read that last entry.</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>8.29am: Men's Kayak K1 500m final featuring Great Britain's Tim Brabant</strong> In Lane 1, Tim Brabants gets off to a flyer and is in second place at the halfway mark. Australia's Ken Wallace gets the gold medal, Adam van Somebodyorother from Canada gets second, despite having had a huge lead at the halfway stage and Tim Brabants gets the bronze for Great Britain. Dr Brabant has brought Great Britain's medal's tally to a whopping 45.</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>8.37am:</strong> Officially, there's a photo-finish in the Kayak race, but I'm pretty sure it'll be as you were at 8.29am ... except I hope to find out the Canadian's surname at some point in the near future.</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>8.42am:</strong> Still no sign of the official result of the Men's Kayak K1 500m final. They must have used one of those cameras you see in westerns, where an old bloke holds a flash in one hand before ducking under a cloth hanging down the back.</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>8.44am:</strong> \"Brabant should know that bronzing for us isn't good enough, Team GB expects athletes to gold every time,\" writes Oliver Pattenden, committing further crimes against the English language. The old photographer has emerged from the dark room and the official result of the men's Kayaking K1 500m final is in: Gold: Ken Wallace (Australia). Silver: Adam van Koeverden (Canada). Bronze: Tim Brabants (Great Britain).</p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>8.50pm:</strong> It's the women's +67kg Taekwondo quarter-finals and Great Britain's Sarah Stevenson is up against the unbeaten double Olympic champion China's Chen Zong. With it being an event with judges featuring a Chinese athlete, it should go without saying that Stevenson is losing - she's 1-0 down in the third round and is getting increasingly frustrated with the judges.</p> <!-- Block 103 --> <p><strong>8.54am:</strong> For the second time in 24 hours, a Briton is <em>robbed</em> in the Taekwondo. With the last kick of the contest, Stevenson got a clean kick on Chen Zong's head, which would have earned her two points and victory. She appealed for the points, the judges had a pow-wow and then didn't give it to her. That is an unbelievable travesty.</p> <!-- Block 104 --> <p><strong>8.56am:</strong> Despite being a victim of an outrageous injustice, Sarah Stevenson is fairly calm in her post-bout interview - that is to say, she's a lot calmer than I would be if I'd just come a cropper in a similar fashion. In the BBC studio, Clare Balding and Adrian Chiles are absolutely outraged. For reasons I don't understand, Stevenson still has a <em>slim</em> chance of getting to fight for bronze in the repechage. If she has to fight a Chinese in it, she might as well not turn up.</p> <!-- Block 105 --> <p><strong>9.09am:</strong> Tim Brabants is being interviewed after \"thirding\" in the Kayaking. He's thanking everyone at home for all the support and saying it'll be \"easy to go back home and be Dr Tim again because nobody ever recognises me.\" Meanwhile, this from Gary Naylor: \"Like JPR Wiliams stitching his own face at half-time, does Dr Brabants get to do his own drug test?\"</p> <!-- Block 106 --> <p><strong>9.12am:</strong> Bad news for Great Britain - Russia have just passed them in the medals table. The Brits need another gold quickly, but they're not going to get one in the men's mountain biking, where France's Julien Absalon, the defending champion and four times world champion, is winning at his leisure. He's being followed by another Frenchman, Jean-Christophe Peraud, while Switzerland's Nino Schurter is coming third. For Great Britain, Liam Killeen and Oliver Beckingsale will be giving interviews afterwards in which they'll tell us what a great experience they've had and how much it'll stand to them for London 2012. Whatever ...</p> <!-- Block 107 --> <p><strong>9.20am: Women's Kayak K1 500m final featuring Great Britain's Lucy Wainwright.</strong> Wainwright in Lane 8 misses the jump badly and is well down at the halfway mark. She doesn't finish in the medals, but it's another photo finish which is won by Inna Osypenko-Rodomska from the Ukraine, with Italy finishing second and Germany third. Wainright was seventh, but I'm sure she enjoyed the experience and it'll stand to her in London 2012.</p> <!-- Block 108 --> <p><strong>9.30am:</strong> \"Just reading your excellent coverage of Olympics. Without being all 'Channel 4 News' about it, isn't Sarah Stevenson in danger of being sent to a Chinese Re-education Camp for her protests?\" asks Sam Williams. Well thank you very much for your kind words, Sam, but I think our Olympic coverage - this bit of it at least - was excellent until I took over. This is my Olympic Rolling Report debut and I'm struggling badly. The fact that I'm usually only going home at this time on a Saturday morning isn't helping. I thought Sarah Stevenson was remarkably stoic considering the robbery that was visited upon her. I mean, it's difficult to put into words how much of a travesty it was. She nearly kicked her Chinese opponent's head clean off her shoulders and at least two of the judges managed to miss it. Imagine of Padraig Harrington had holed his winning putt in the US PGA and the tournament officials had just ignored it and handed the trophy to Sergio Garcia instead - that's how bad it was.</p> <!-- Block 109 --> <p><strong>9.35am:</strong> The men's mountain-biking is still going on, with France's Julian Absalon looking home and hosed for France. His compatriot Peraud is still coming second, over a minute behind. Two Swiss riders are battling it out for third place, while the Brits are coming 11th and 15th respectively.</p> <!-- Block 110 --> <p><strong>9.41am: </strong> \"That taekwondo bout just about nails it for me with every sport that requires a judges score,\" harrumphs Tom Clarke. \"There have been numerous scandals in the boxing, why on earth did they bring another sport like that in? However, surely with 'home support' we must do better in 2012?\"</p> <!-- Block 111 --> <p><strong>9.42am:</strong> With just one lap of the circuit to go out of eight, France's Julien Absalon leads his compatriot Jean-Christophe Peraud - barring an accident they'll finish first and second respectively. Swiss riders Nino Schurter and Christoph Sauser are almost certain to duke it out for the bronze medal, as they've opened a decent gap to Germany's Manuel Fumic.</p> <!-- Block 112 --> <p><strong>The shame of it - this is the result that put the Russians ahead of Great Britain in the medals table ...</strong></p> <p>Olympic synchronised swimming team free routine.</p> <p>1. Russia 50.000 points 99.500<br>Anastasia Davydova/Anastasia Ermakova/Maria Gromova/Natalia Ishchenko/Elvira Khassianova/Olga Kuzhela/Elena Ovtchinnikova/Svetlana Romashina/Anna Shorina</p> <p>2.

He crosses the line, jumps off his bike, taps the road and waves appreciatively to the cheering crowd. Soon after, Jean Christophe Peraud rolls home to bag silver, while Nino Schurter comfortably beats Christoph Sauser to take bronze for the Swiss. For Great Britain, Liam Killeen finishes in a very credita ... no, it's very creditable because he had a crash early doors, 7th place. His thunder is somewhat stolen, however, by Italy's Marco Fontana, who finished 5th in extravagant style by riding the last couple of hundred metres pulling a one-handed wheelie. Top class!</p> <!-- Block 114 --> <p><strong>10.14am:</strong> With nothing Olympic on at the moment, the BBC have handed over to Shirley \"Blonde in a boat\" Robertson, who is interviewing people at the Great Britain sailing party. They're all heroically drunk, including her. \"Sheesh my besht boson's mate!\" Meanwhile back at the Taekwondo, all hell os breaking lose, where the Great Britain team have lodged an official complaint about the ridiculous result of the Sarah Stevenson match. The competition supervisory board has looked into the matter and ... CHANGED THE RESULT!!!</p> <!-- Block 115 --> <p>VERY BRAVE TAEKWONDO OFFICIAL: \"In applying paragraph two on page 64 of the competition rules we have to change this result and to declare the British player as the winner. Justice is served.\"<br>ANGRY CHINESE MOB: \"Boooooo! Boo!\"</p> <p>Apparently this is unprecedented in Taekwondo - presumably the Chinese will appeal this decisions. Who'd have thunk a game of Lots Of Jumping But Not Much Kicking could be so exciting?</p> <!-- Block 116 --> <p><strong>10.26am:</strong> It's worth noting that the announcement that the result of the Sarah Stevenson bout hjas been overturned has not yet been made in mandarin - all hell could break loose when that happens. Stevenson is now in the semi-final against a Mexican. On the BBC, the <em>chef d'equipe</em> of the British taekwondo team is saying that the Chinese had no grumbles about their girl getting her \"win\" taken away from her.</p> <!-- Block 117 --> <p><strong>10.32am:</strong> Chen Zong, the Chinese girl who has now been eliminated from the taekwondo, had been going for her third consecutive Olympic gold medal, so Stevenson couldn't have taken a bigger scalp. However, there are thousands of Chinese fans in the hall waiting to see their hero Chen Zong fight a Mexican - they still haven't been told what's going on in their own language.</p> <!-- Block 118 --> <p><strong>10.37am:</strong> According to my man near the spot, Sean Ingle, the Chinese may have re-protested. The scoreboard currently reads: \"Beijing apologises for the delay. Competition will commence shortly.\" The word from the BBC's commentator is that Great Britain's Sarah Stevenson will take on Mexico's Maria Espinoza in the taekwondo semi-final in five minutes.</p> <!-- Block 119 --> <p><strong>10.46am:</strong> It's announced in Mandarin, to the rather partisan crowd, that their girl won't be fighting in the semi-final. To say they're not best pleased is putting it mildly. Espinoza and Stevenson emerge for their bout to the sound of much booing. The rules: one point for a kick to your opponent's body, two points for a kick upsides their head. They get underway and at the end of round one, much to the delight of the largely Chinese audience, Stevenson finds herself 2-0 down.</p> <!-- Block 120 --> <p><strong>10.49am:</strong> Round two: Sarah Stevenson goes 3-0 down after shipping another kick in the red protector around her torso. Moments later, she's 4-1 down and goes down with an injury to her right leg. At the end of round two, Stevenson finds herself 4-1 down and limping badly.</p> <!-- Block 121 --> <p><strong>10.53am:</strong> Thirty seconds into round three and Espinoza goes down injured, but she's OK. Bah! \"Sarah Stevenson needs the big head shot ... the money shot,\" says the BBC's Nick Mullins. Money shots? <em>Money shots?</em> That's a rule of Taekwondo I'm not familiar with, I have to confess. Anyway, the Mexican's chin remains blissfully splash- and foot-free, and she takes the win and goes on to fight for silver or gold, while Stevenson gets to fight for bronze. Despite getting her reprieve, Sarah Stevenson is saying that she didn't get enough time to prepare for her fight and wasn't ready for it. From where I'm sitting, it sounds suspiciously like a whinge.</p> <!-- Block 122 -->       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4NfkH3Q4JOQ?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <object width=\"460\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/4NfkH3Q4JOQ&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/4NfkH3Q4JOQ&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"460\" height=\"385\"></embed></object> </figure>   <p><strong>11.04am:</strong> Here's that Taekwondo fight to keep you amused while I go for a short break.</p> <!-- Block 123 --> <p><strong>11.21am:</strong> \"Dear Esteemed Guardian Journo,\" writes Rob Bloxham, beginning a mail I have a terrible feeling is going to be incredibly patronising. </p> <p>\"I know it's a little late (being Day 15 of this glorious sporting and marketing extravaganza) but I feel it's about time I drew your attention to an error that may have profound consequences for the future of the British Union.

All Lawrie's missing is a bait shop, a wife named Ailsa and some corks dangling from the brim of his hat.</p> <!-- Block 126 --> <p><strong>11.42am:</strong> That's me done for the morning, but Howard Swains will be here in as long as it takes to complete a clunky hangover and if you're very lucky, he'll tell you all about the delayed recording of the synchronised swimming that he's leering at on the television at the moment.</p> <!-- Block 127 --> <p><strong>12pm: </strong>As Glendenning heads off contemplates what would constitute a money shot in the <strong>synchronised swimming</strong> pool, I'll do my best to ignore the wonderfully choreographed department-store-beauty-counter-cum-Stepford-Wives currently spinning, smiling and splashing their way towards noon on the telly. Russia win this anyway, and overtake Britain at the top* of the medals table as they do.</p> <p>Instead, let's take a look at what's coming up. Lazarus in a Power Rangers costume <strong>Sarah Stevenson</strong> gets her chance to fight for bronze in the taekwondo repechage in about half an hour, although she reportedly knacked and ankle in qualifying** for the bronze medal kick-off that she would have been in anyway had the blustering British blazers not succeeded in their orchestrated whinge at the judges.</p> <p>Then there's the pipsqueak, loveable tyke, Artful Dodger <strong>Tom Daley</strong> in the 10m diving final. The six-year-old would become the youngest Sir in Great Britain should he take gold and force the Queen to knight him in the New Year's Honours list. More realistically, the middleweight <strong>James DeGale</strong> boxes for gold or silver at the Worker's Gymnasium at about 1.45pm our time. </p> <p>There's also the final of the baseball (the final final, no less, <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/08/23/bottom_of_the_ninth_for_baseba.html\">as Andy Bull blogs about here</a>) between Cuba and Korea, and the bronze medal of the men's hockey. Nope, neither do I.</p> <p>Then it's the Bird's Nest all the way for the penultimate day of athletics. The women's 1500m runner <strong>Lisa Dobriskey</strong> is the best individual chance for Team GB!GB!GB!, although the telly commentators are still holding out hope that the <strong>4x400m runners</strong> can cling onto a tube of metal long enough to win something in the relay. I'm sceptical. </p> <p>Stay here, whatever.</p> <p>*provided, as per the British tabloids, third is the new first.<br>** losing the semi-final</p> <!-- Block 128 --> <p><strong>12.05pm: Handball:</strong> John Allen, in Singapore, is engrossed by the handball, and even manages to distill this nation's simmering anti-Russian sentiment into one email: \"At least we can take heart that the brave handballers of Norway, calling on the warrior spirit of their ancestors in Valhalla, are stuffing the Russians 32-22 in the women's final. With 26 minutes of the second half gone there's only a certain amount of time, unknown to myself, left before they take gold. And.....Norge win! Vladimir Putin, Lenin, Josef Stalin, Roman Abramovich, the first dog in space...your girls took one hell of a beating. 34-27. It's like a free gold for Team GB (and any people from the 6 counties who want in, too).\"</p> <!-- Block 129 --> <p><strong>12.09pm: Boxing:</strong> Scrap that chronology as it seems it's boxing up first, with the Hammersmith Hammer James DeGale going for gold in the ring. I say Hammersmith Hammer, although I've only got the word of Rebranded Website's and two-time Beer Writer of the Year's Ben MacFarland to go on, who claims to have grown up on the similar west London mean streets as DeGale.</p> <!-- Block 130 --> <p><strong>12.13pm: The Naylor report:</strong> \"I'm deeply disappointed that Team GB failed to impress in the synchronised swimming,\" laments Our Gary. \"Had it done so, it might have inspired a generation in the municipal pools around the country. And what would be funnier than that?\" You tell us, MBM readership. What could be funnier than that?*</p> <p>*unfunny responses will be considered.</p> <!-- Block 131 --> <p><strong>12.15pm: Boxing: </strong>Ah hell, there's some feathweight boxing on first, in which a Cuban and a Thai are knocking the proverbial seven bells. The Thai fighter is dumped on his rear during the third round, but has the last laugh as the BBC decides to end it right there and tell us that he won 8-2. Again, you heard it here second.</p> <!-- Block 132 --> <p><strong>12.17pm: Taekwondo:</strong> Here's Sarah Stevenson in the taekwondo repechage, against Noha Abd Rabo, of Egypt. \"This day has been full of shenanigans and drama,\" says the taekwondo commentator, and he's not wrong. Take a spin through Glendenning's work earlier to catch up.</p> <!-- Block 133 --> <p><strong>12.19pm: Taekwondo: </strong>There's a good deal of squeaking to add to the kicking, jumping and dancing preciously described by newcomers to taekwondo in this MBM report. As a veteran of this pursuit, having watched Aaron Cook yesterday, I can tell you that it's hardly going according to the script here: Stevenson is 3-0 up at the end of the second round, which is not how it works for Team GB!GB!GB!'s taekwondo fighters. This should be a nailed on glorious defeat.</p> <!-- Block 134 --> <p><strong>12.22pm: Taekwondo: </strong> The Egyptian gets a point back against Stevenson, to bring her within two. But the Doncaster belle gets one right back, and then another one, to go 5-1 up with 30 seconds left.</p> <!-- Block 135 --> <p><strong>12.24pm: Sarah Stevenson wins bronze in women's heavyweight taekwondo</strong><br>She wins that bronze medal match 5-1 and becomes the first-ever British taekwondo medallist. \"She thought the judges had taken her dream away,\" hyperventilates Nick Mullins in the commentary box. But now she has that bronze medal, which is what we all dream of, always.</p> <!-- Block 136 --> <p><strong>12.28pm: Taekwondo:</strong> From the school of great British post-match interviews comes this question for bronze medal \"winner\" Sarah Stevenson in the taekwondo hall: \"What was the low point of the day?\" Matt Pinsent was the man with the mic.</p> <!-- Block 137 --> <p><strong>12.30pm: Athletics: </strong>Straight over to the Bird's Nest for the men's 800m final, where many of the favourites, and all the British runners - indeed, all of the European athletes - failed to qualify, leaving it <em>wide</em> open for someone else to win. From Africa, Asia or the Americas.</p> <!-- Block 138 --> <p><strong>12.37pm: Athletics:</strong> \"Two laps of intrigue and surely drama as well,\" says Steve Cram, bigging up the final of the 800m as though it's the new Inspector Morse. But no one dies in Oxford, just a gold medal for Wilfred Bungei, of Kenya, who leads for most of the second lap, holds off the challenge of Ismail Ismail (not a misprint), and takes gold. Ismailx2 takes silver and Alfred Yego is third.</p> <!-- Block 139 --> <p><strong>12.40pm: Javelin:</strong> I don't know much about Finnish javelin throwers, but my guess is that Tera Jarvenpaa, who has just taken the lead in the final of the men's competition, likes heavy metal music.</p> <!-- Block 140 --> <p><strong>12.41pm:</strong> As Lighting \"Usain\" Bolt joins his Jamaican team-mates on the podium for their 4x100m relay victory yesterday, we shift from the sublime sprinter to the ridiculous national leader and some \"intriguing\" comments from Gordon Brown on the Olympics, football and 2012: \"I think when people are looking at the Olympics in 2012 - Britain, home of football, where football was invented, which we gave to the world - I think people would be very surprised if there is an Olympic tournament in football and we are not part of it.\" It's coming home, etc., etc., for the next four dreary years.</p> <!-- Block 141 --> <p><strong>12.50pm: Taekwondo farce - Fighter kicks referee in the head: </strong> More bonkers nonsense in the taekwondo hall, quickly becoming the new hotbed of farce at these Games after the Stevenson incident earlier. In the bronze medal match of the men's over 80kg class, the Cuban player Angel Matos was timed out after going over the 60 seconds allowed for an on-mat injury. His Kazakh opponent celebrated the bronze and Matos got up and KICKED THE REFEREE IN THE HEAD. I kid you not. He's just KICKED THE REFEREE IN THE HEAD. \"There could be police involvement,\" says Nick Mullins in the commentary box. \"There could be war,\" adds Barry Glendenning in my ear.</p> <!-- Block 142 --> <p><strong>12.56pm: </strong>Britain's Lisa Dobriskey is running in the final of the 1500m at the Bird's Nest, but I can't keep my eyes off the taekwondo hall feed and the hope that we see that referee kick again. No luck as yet, but this is a global incident in the making.</p> <!-- Block 143 --> <p><strong>12.58pm: Athletics: </strong> The censors are out in the taekwondo hall and they're pretending that it never happened. But I saw it with my own eyes (fortuitously, I grant you), that guy kicked the referee. Anyway, Lisa Dobrisky finished in fourth - agonising fourth as it's now officially known - after, apparently, getting her tactics wrong. No kidding. Anyway, Nancy Langat, of Kenya, won gold ahead of two Ukrainians. \"It's just a shame they don't give medals for fourth,\" says Brendan Foster. Made of what, Brendan? Tin? You don't go to Beijing to fourth.</p> <!-- Block 144 --> <p><strong>1.09pm:</strong> USA are playing Brazil in the final of the women's volleyball. China are playing Russia in the bronze medal match of the women's basketball. Cuba are playing Korea in the final of the baseball, and a Swede called Jorgen Persson is playing a Chinese named Wang Liqin, which you probably shouldn't say out loud, in the bronze medal match of the table tennis. That's what your missing here.</p> <p>\"She's a lovely, lovely girl,\" says Dame Kelly Holmes of Lisa Dobriskey, who has just blown her chance at Damehood by, by all accounts, getting her tactics totally wrong and allowing the leaders to get too far ahead of her in the 1500m final.</p> <p>Still a blackout on the taekwondo referee head-kick, by the way. But it happened. I swear it did.</p> <!-- Block 145 --> <p><strong>1.15pm: Diving: </strong>The men's 10m diving final has started, in which British embryo <strong>Tom Daley</strong> is leaping. I haven't got a clue about this, except that spinning is good, splashing is bad, and that Daley has got no chance of winning. Still, Luxin Zhou of China leads with 84 points after the first dive, and Daley is in agonisingfourth with less than that.</p> <!-- Block 146 -->  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336904830\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2008/08/23/cuban2.jpg\" alt=\"Angel Valodia Matos of Cuba kicks out at referee Chakir Chelbat of Sweden\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Angel Valodia Matos of Cuba kicks out at referee Chakir Chelbat of Sweden.

The Cuban taekwondo loser kicks out at the referee.</p> <!-- Block 147 --> <p><strong>1.22pm: Athletics: Kenenisa Bekele takes gold in men's 5,000m </strong></p> <!-- Block 148 --> <p><strong>1.23pm: Athletics:</strong> We all got kind of carried away here after that taekwondo kick, so much so that I missed the majority of the men's 5,000m final. But Kenenisa Bekele absolutely cruised it, winning by about six seconds to complete the long-distance double for Ethiopia. He congratulates with an Usain Bolt-style arrow mime kind of thing, but sort of gets it wrong. It's a new Olympic record. Kipchoge and Soi were second and third.</p> <!-- Block 149 --> <p><strong>1.29pm:</strong> As Tom Daley tries to wrap up agonisingfourth in the diving, <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/08/23/ever_increasing_cycles.html\">William Fotherington wonders where all our gold-medal-winning cyclists are going to bike to now?</a> Oh, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/23/olympics.cubanattacksref\">read all about the Cuban Cantona attacking the referee here.</a></p> <!-- Block 150 --> <p><strong>1.35pm:</strong> The men's diving is in its third round now, and I've no idea how Britain's glint-in-the-milkman's-eye Tom Daley got on in the second round, nor if he's sprung in the third. But the women's 4x400m relay runners are out now in the Bird's Nest, so don't expect many more diving updates until the baton is nestled safely on the Beijing track.</p> <!-- Block 151 --> <p><strong>1.38pm:</strong> Christine Ohuruogu, Kelly Sotherton, Marilyn Okoro and Nicola Sanders are the women charged with showing their proud nation that they can pass the equivalent of a rolled up newspaper to one another three times without dropping it. Their impossible task begins momentarily.</p> <!-- Block 152 --> <p><strong>1.40pm:</strong> Team GB!GB!GB!'s Olympic champion Christine Ohuruogu is off first for Britain in this relay thing, and she's leading when she hands off to agonisingfourth place heptathlete Kelly Sotherton.</p> <!-- Block 153 --> <p><strong>1.42pm:</strong> A hopeless run from Sotherton, who runs out of steam and hands off the baton in fifth place to Marilyn Okoro. She manages to get back into second-last place, and it's Nicola Sanders now. Russia lead.</p> <!-- Block 154 --> <p><strong>1.43pm: USA win gold in women's 4x400m relay</strong></p> <!-- Block 155 --> <p><strong>1.46pm: Athletics:</strong> The United States' Sanya Richards won it on the final leg, reeling in a huge lead from the Russians to take over with about five metres to go. Britain finished fifth.</p> <!-- Block 156 --> <p><strong>1.46pm: Boxing:</strong> Breathlessly, we shift to the Worker's Gymnasium for the middleweight gold medal bout between <strong>James DeGale</strong> and Cuba's tapestry Emlio \"Bayeaux\" Correa.</p> <!-- Block 157 --> <p><strong>1.49pm:</strong> Terrific start for DeGale, who lands two punches in the opening minute to lead 2-0. Then it's three, and then one back for the Cuban, and then one more. And then ... what? ... DeGale gets two points after apparently being bitten by Correa. \"Hey, he bit me,\" DeGale says, and the ref agreed. The Brit leads 6-1 at the end of the first.</p> <!-- Block 158 --> <p><strong>1.54pm: Boxing: </strong> A thunderous right hand from DeGale takes him to 7-3 and then another couple of dabs gets him a 10-4 lead at the end of the round. The Cuban has lost his discipline already, in profound contrast to the \"Hammersmith Hammer\", who dances around a couple of haymakers from Correa and sneaks another quick point with a jab at the end.</p> <!-- Block 159 --> <p><strong>1.58pm:</strong> It's not pretty, but DeGale leads 12-10 at the end of the round, and is still looking for gold against a Cuban who seems keen just to hold on, drop back, and then charge messily forward. But that's a good end to the round for Correa, who connects with several swift combinations and might actually fancy his chances now. So don't read the top bit of this update, jut the bottom bit.</p> <p>Something else that wasn't pretty was the Cuban taekwondo referee-fight earlier, and his full crimes have now been listed as punching a referee, kicking a judge and spat on the floor. A perfect hat-trick, that has now earned him a lifetime ban for him and his coach.</p> <!-- Block 160 --> <p><strong>2.01pm:</strong> Anther scrappy round, but DeGale shows more composure to time a couple of right-hands to go 15-12 ahead. But the Cuban gets it back to 15-13 with 30 seconds left and DeGale attempts to cling on, literally, to the victory. He gets another smart jab in with 20 seconds left to go 16-14 up, and that's it. DeGale wins.</p> <!-- Block 161 --> <p><strong>2.02pm: Great Britain's James DeGale wins gold in middleweight boxing</strong></p> <!-- Block 162 --> <p><strong>2.03pm: Boxing: </strong> Britain get back on the gold track, or something equally hyperbolic, courtesy of a first-round bite from Emilio Correa, which costs him two points and ultimately gifts the victory to DeGale. It was hardly one for the purists, but that's a gold medal nonetheless, GB's 19th. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/23/olympics.boxing\">Read about it here</a>. When it's done. Which it isn't yet.</p> <!-- Block 163 --> <p><strong>2.08pm: Athletics: </strong>Right on cue for the start of the men's 4x400m, the computer crashes. That means I pick it up as Andrew Steele passes off to whoever's running the second leg in sixth place. Tobin, that's who. USA lead, from Belgium (Belgium again?).</p> <!-- Block 164 --> <p><strong>2.09pm: Athletics:</strong> Martyn Rooney is on the anchor leg for Britain but there's nothing he can do from sixth. USA wins, the Bahamas get second, Russia third and YES! agonisingfourth for Britain.</p> <!-- Block 165 --> <p><strong>2.11pm: Athletics: USA win gold in men's 4x400m relay</strong><br>Comfortable in the end for the United States, for whom Jeremy Wariner coasts to the line to wrap up the victory; the third fastest run of all time. Bahamas take the silver and Russia the bronze.</p> <!-- Block 166 --> <p><strong>2.18pm: Diving: </strong>Tom Daley lies sixth after the fifth round of the diving. The Chinese diver Luxin Zhou is on course for a pillar-to-post gold. He leads with 458.35 judge's points. Daley has 398.95.</p> <!-- Block 167 --> <p><strong>2.23pm:</strong> I think there are 10 rounds in the diving; there were in the semis, but maybe the final is different, who knows. I think they go in reverse order in each round, which means the young chimney sweep Daley will be off soon-ish. South Korea will be the reigning Olympic baseball champions from here until the end of time, as they've just won the last ever final.</p> <!-- Block 168 --> <p><strong>2.26pm: Diving:</strong> OK, so there are six dives in the final round and Tom Daley has just had his last plummet. It wasn't six of the best for the whippersnapper, and he won't be taking home a medal unless all of the remaining four divers are killed in the next ten seconds.</p> <!-- Block 169 --> <p><strong>2.28pm: Athletics and Diving: </strong>Your licence fee is currently paying for television coverage of the women's high-jump final, where some very spindly women, including a bespectacled one from Belgium named Tia Hellebaut, are soaring over a bar set at about 2.05m. Blanca Vlasic, of Croatia, has also done that and gets silver at least, with the bronze going to someone else. In the diving, British suggestive wink Tom Daley is out of medal contention, but the Australian Matthew Mitcham takes gold with an amazing last dive.</p> <!-- Block 170 --> <p><strong>2.35pm:</strong> Australia win gold in the men's 10m diving after Mitchell scored an almost perfect 10 in the final round. The Chinese judge didn't think it was that great, but all the others did and the Australian pipped home favourite Luxin Zhou at the end. That's the only gold medal the Chinese were impartially judged not to have won.</p> <!-- Block 171 --> <p><strong>2.37pm:</strong> The bespectacled Belgian Tia Hellebaut wins gold in the women's high jump after both her and her better-sighted, or contact-lens wearing, Croatian opponent both clear 2.05m but can't go higher. Hellebaut took fewer previous jumps so wins.</p> <!-- Block 172 --> <p><strong>2.40pm:</strong> Tom Daley was seventh in the diving, which is creditable for the 14-year-old, I'll grudgingly concede. He's got a difficult late adolescence and unceasing hype to look forward to before he can be officially crowned \"medal prospect\" for London 2012.</p> <p>That's that from another MBM day. It's the closing ceremony and hand-over to London tomorrow. Be sure to tune in.</p> <p>Bye.</p>"
