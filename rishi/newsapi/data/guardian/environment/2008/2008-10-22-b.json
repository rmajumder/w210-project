  "<p>International students are more concerned with how close a university is to London than by the fees it charges, a study has shown.</p> <p>Studying in or near the capital is one of the top priorities for overseas students deciding where to study for a degree in the UK, Lancaster University academics found.</p> <p>It matters more to them than how much their <a href=\"http://education.theguardian.com/students/internationalstudents/page/0,,2280999,00.html\">course costs</a>, which for undergraduate students from outside the European Union ranges from \u00a36,410 per year at the University of the Highlands and Islands to \u00a319,450 per year at Imperial College London for 2008-09.</p> <p>Where a university and its courses rank in newspaper league tables is another factor which comes before the cost of fees for international students, the study showed.</p> <p>Economics lecturers, Dr Kwok Soo and Dr Caroline Elliott, analysed how international students chose where to study at 97 universities between 2002 and 2007.</p> <p>The researchers looked at students applying for degrees in business studies or engineering to get a spread of classroom-based and lab-based subjects.</p> <p>They created a statistical model to compare the impact of factors such as the cost of a course, the importance of the university's city having a Premiership football team and the city's average rainfall on an international student's decision where to study.</p> <p>They looked at the relationship of each factor on the number of applications and tested to see if as fees increased, for example, the number of applications fell proportionately. </p> <p>Their study used statistics from the universities and colleges admissions service, Ucas.</p> <p>Elliott said: \"We find that the fees charged may influence the application decision of some students, but that there isn't a proportionate relationship between fees and the number of applications.</p> <p>\"Proximity to London and the existing popularity of a university among students already living in the UK are significant predictors of university applications.\"</p> <p>The study comes as the British Council warned universities today that the number of overseas students in the UK was likely to dip in the next five years.</p> <p>Overseas students from outside the EU contribute \u00a32.87bn to the UK economy each year and are a growing part of universities' income. Some 75,830 took full-time undergraduate and postgraduate degrees at UK universities in 2006-07.</p> <p>But China and India, traditional recruiting grounds for UK universities, are building their own higher education markets, the British Council said.</p> <p>It urged UK universities to focus less on recruiting international students and more on building links with universities overseas.</p> <p>Pat Killingley, the British Council's director of higher education, said: \"It is essential that serious long-term investment is put in place to maintain the UK's brand and its position in the global education market. Without this, the UK is in real danger of losing its place as a major player.\"</p>",
  "<p>India's first unmanned moon mission blasted into space yesterday, joining the Asian space race with Japan and China and signalling India's intent to be a global power.</p> <p>The mission, launched from the Sriharikota space centre north of Chennai, was broadcast live on television to the sound of the Star Wars film soundtrack.</p> <p>\"What we have started is a remarkable journey,\" said G Madhavan Nair, chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation. The prime minister, Manmohan Singh, who was visiting Japan, said: \"Our scientific community has once again done the country proud and the entire nation salutes them.\"</p> <p>The launch follows unmanned lunar probes from China and Japan last year.</p> <p>The Chandrayaan I spacecraft is expected to reach lunar orbit early next month and spend two years scanning the moon for evidence of water and precious metals. India is hoping the mission will boost its space programme into the same league as its rival Asian powerhouses. Nair said the space agency was aiming at a manned flight by 2015. Work on a two-person capsule was already under way.</p> <p>As well as seeking a larger share of the commercial satellite launch market, India, Japan and China see their space programmes as important for creating an image of powerful nation-states. In 2003 China became only the third nation to put a man into space, after the US and Russia. Last month Chinese astronauts walked in space.</p> <p>It is clear India does not want to be left behind. By 2011 it will send a rover on to the lunar surface.</p> <p>The current mission carries 11 instruments: five from India, two from the US, and one each from Germany, Britain, Sweden and Bulgaria.</p>",
  "<p>Back in the days of no-holds-barred advertising by Madison Avenue's finest, anything went. Drinking alcohol made you sexy, smoking cigarettes was good for your lungs and every washing powder contained a magic ingredient that made your whites super-white.</p> <p>And guess what? Those days are back, at least for green <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/advertising\">advertising</a>. As more and more customers demand environmental responsibility from companies, few large corporations with any sort of public profile now dare to enter the marketplace without a blizzard of sustainability audits and low-carbon-emissions targets. But that being so, the risk of being conned by slick corporate \"greenwash\" has never been greater, as the volume of complaints to the <a href=\"http://www.asa.org.uk/asa/\">Advertising Standards Authority</a> (ASA) testifies.</p> <p>The green claims coming from corporations can be absurdly general. Nearly everything we buy these days seems to be \"sustainably sourced\" or \"environmentally friendly\". Sometimes, though, they are crazily specific. Virgin Trains declares: \"Our Pendolino trains emit 76% less CO2 than cars or domestic flights.\" But which cars, which flights, and how full are the trains? </p> <p>Or plain bonkers. One brand of bottled water says its product contains \"300% more oxygen\". </p> <p>In August, the ad industry's watchdog, the ASA, rapped oil company Shell's knuckles for trying to claim, in an advertisement in the Financial Times, that its $10bn investment in sucking tar sands out of the Canadian midwest was a contribution to a sustainable energy future. Tar sands contain bitumen. It takes a great deal of energy to turn them into something you can put in a fuel tank. Overall, the emissions from mining, refining and burning tar sands are between three and 10 times greater than for conventional oil. Shell's sleight of hand was to use the much-abused word \"sustainability\" to imply a green agenda when what it was really on about was keeping a sustainable flow of fuel out of its forecourt pumps. The ASA cried foul.</p> <p>Earlier in the year, the agency also upheld complaints against Renault for branding its Twingo an \"eco\" car and picturing it with leaves blowing out of its tailpipe, even though its emissions are among the worst for a car of its size. </p> <p>Advertising, says the ASA, \"should always avoid the vague use of terms such as sustainable, green, non-polluting and so on\". </p> <p>In the real world, we have to admit, things can be nuanced. Lots of corporate claims - about carbon neutrality, for instance - hang on exactly what activities are being audited. Take Manchester airport, which was outed in a recent report from the sustainable development organisation, Forum for the Future. Last year the airport's owners pledged to make the airport carbon-neutral, with one small caveat: the target does not include the 200,000-plus flights into and out of the airport each year. As Forum for the Future observed, \"this jars somewhat\".</p> <p>And what are we to make of Fiji Water's claims to be cutting the carbon footprint of its water by 25% and offsetting the rest? \"Every drop is green,\" it says. But isn't the whole idea of bottling water on a remote South Pacific island and shipping it to your dinner table just a tiny bit barmy? </p> <p>Equally questionable are the claims of financial institutions. Back in the days (oh, only a few weeks ago) when the City of London was concerned with something other than day-to-day corporate survival, the City of London Corporation launched a City Climate Pledge, under which finance houses would pledge to \"measure and monitor\" their carbon footprint. Good for them. Perhaps a few will follow the lead of HSBC, which has developed close links with the environment group WWF and has claimed since 2005 to be the world's first carbon-neutral bank. </p> <p>But the pledge looks suspiciously like greenwash. Companies simply have to fill out a form detailing their CO2 plans and they can use the pledge logo. \"Companies using the logo will be recognised as exemplar sustainable businesses [able to] attract consumers who are becoming more discerning about the credentials of businesses they deal with,\" says the flyer. Not bad for just filling out a form. Especially as there doesn't seem to be any follow-up or auditing process involved.</p> <p>But as with the efforts of Manchester airport and Fiji Water, there remains a rather large elephant in the living room. The carbon footprint of finance houses is not about whether they offset executive flights or put double glazing in the boardroom; it is about their investment decisions. The press release put out by the City of London said the pledge would \"encourage City organisations to use their global influence to affect the behaviour of companies around the UK and the world\". Could the City be about to impose a freeze on cash for tar sands or coal-fired power stations? Not so fast. The pledge itself makes no mention of this. </p> <p>I would have expected City institutions to be falling over themselves to sign up to the pledge. But 11 months after companies were first asked to sign the pledge, and three months after its public launch, the pledge's website is still promising that a list of signatories \"will be available shortly\", and further inquiries revealed that just one company - Deutsche Bank - had so far completed registration. Right now the pledge looks like a one-day PR wonder to green the City's image, with no substance at all. Or maybe they are all just a little busy right now. </p> <p>To try to keep up with the welter of environmental claims, test the green spin and spot the green frauds, the Guardian is launching today a regular online column, Greenwash, and calls on readers to submit their examples of the fraudulent, mendacious, confusing, ignorant or just daft claims jostling for our attention.</p> <p>Along the way, we may get to the heart of a dilemma that faces us all. Can we shop our way to sustainability? Are some products so green it is better to buy two of them rather than one? Or are our own consumer lifestyles, suffused in greenwash, the problem? Is there really no alternative to putting away our credit cards, pulling on our thickest jumper and heading for the hills?</p> <p>We won't be limiting our investigations to corporations - we'll have politicians in our sights, too. Scraping away at the green patina on the new-look, Zac Goldsmith-inspired Conservative environmental policies, puncturing Brown's grumpy greenery and unpicking the carbon contortions of the coal-loving Celts. And now that both Barack Obama and John McCain claim environmental credentials, we'll be looking for greenwash at the White House too.</p> <p>And we won't forget that, even in the corporate world, greenwash is not just a defensive mantra to help maintain business as usual. Some people are out there pushing the environmental agenda with sinister intent. Take, for example, the green rebranding of Steptoe and Son.</p> <p>Last year the EU introduced the charmingly named WEEE directive, which stands for Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment. The aim is to prevent millions of tonnes of toxic TVs, personal computers, toasters and other electronic goods being dumped into landfill each year. Instead, they have to be recycled. You may not have noticed this because there are no laws stopping you putting that laptop into your dustbin. But corporations and retailers are charged with making sure most of our electronic waste gets recycled. The question is how.</p> <p>Some of this stuff is making its way to a handful of hi-tech metals recycling plants in Europe. But most is going to the developing world. Often it has paperwork claiming it will be refurbished and re-used, but nobody has the resources to police the system, so in practice much of it ends up in primitive workshops in India and west Africa and China, where it is stripped out, boiled up, dunked in acid or smashed to smithereens by unskilled, low-paid and frequently child labour. I have seen this \"recycling\" industry at work in Delhi, where barefooted children as young as eight dunk circuit boards in barrels of acid to remove traces of copper. </p> <p>Last month, a charity called Computer Aid tried to blow the whistle on this. Computer Aid is one of the few organisations that is genuinely and safely refurbishing and reusing old computers, many of them going to schools in Kenya. It fears this \"good\" and socially responsible recycling will be undermined by the bad guys. Why is this happening? Partly because factories in India badly want the metals in your old computer. And partly because too many European companies have a no-questions-asked policy towards every broker and cowboy willing to take troublesome waste off their hands. As one industrial supplier told me last year, \"A lot of these guys don't even have addresses, just mobile phone numbers.\"</p> <p>Recycling may be a new term, but the trade is not new. Until the 60s, recyclers plied the streets of Britain with a horse and cart collecting old stuff that could be sold on. The characters in the television show Steptoe and Son were the archetypes. They have been succeeded by a generation of car-crushers and cable-burners. Nobody called it green then: now they do. But the same wide boys are in charge, so if anybody has their mobile numbers, do please get in touch.</p> <p>We are too ready to suspend our critical faculties with anybody claiming to be green. But a great deal of recycling is not quite what it seems. What happens to recycled glass bottles, for instance? As we post them in the recycling bin, we presume they go to make new bottles and cut out the energy cost of making new glass from sand. My local supermarket bin in south London proudly proclaims that recycling one glass bottle \"saves enough energy to power a TV for 20 minutes\".</p> <p>Well, it would if they turned the glass back into new bottles. But it turns out that often they don't. Much of London's recycled glass is actually crushed and sold to construction firms as a substitute for sand, or an ingredient in a substitute for asphalt such as Glasphalt - \"specially treated so it won't puncture tyres,\" as one recycling website puts it. That's a relief, but how many assiduous recyclers trying to do their bit for the environment realise they are actually helping build new roads?</p> <p>How many more green scams, cons and generous slices of wishful thinking are out there? We want to name and shame them before the whole green movement gets a bad reputation. \"Green\" has another meaning after all - naive. And we cannot afford that.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/23/energy\">Greenwash: Fred Pearce on the con of green electricity</a></p> <h2>How to spot a fake</h2> <p>It's greenwash if it's ...</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Ludicrously general</strong><br>All claims for products being environmentally friendly or pollution-free should have evidence that clearly supports them. </p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Overspecific</strong><br>Be on guard against numbers or other \"facts\" that can only be true in specific circumstances, such as Virgin Trains' claims to have 76% fewer emissions than planes or cars <strong>(see main feature)</strong>. Often these come with a discreet asterisk referencing an obscure study - look the study up, or ask the Guardian's new Greenwash column to do so on your behalf. </p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Reliant on nature pictures</strong><br>Most pernicious, perhaps, are attempts to green products by association, such as cars driving through verdant meadows. </p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Backed up by a tame boffin</strong><br>Companies like to spotlight their researchers working on renewable energy, even if it makes up less than 1% of their business. Anybody can keep a tame boffin: to mean something, such research must be a significiant part of the company's business. (Incidentally, has anyone met a researcher? We would like to hear.)</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Simply absurd</strong><br>If a claim sounds absurd, it probably is. Inside knowledge can help you blow the whistle, but a nose for the absurd is just as good. </p> <h2>How to spot the real thing</h2> <p>It might just be true if ...</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>What the company says matches what they do</strong><br>Rob Harrison of Ethical Consumer thinks the most important question is: \"Is their position consistent right across the group?\" Some car manufacturers advertise their green cars but continue to lobby for lower carbon-reduction targets. Look for companies who match what they say and do, such as Peugeot, one of the only car manufacturers likely to come in under the European emissions targets in 2010. </p> <p>\u2022 <strong>The company is in partnership with an independent ethical organisation</strong><br>Forming a partnership with an independent organisation is voluntary and doesn't have to mean much: groups such as the Ethical Trade Initiative or the Carbon Disclosure Project have little power. All the same, it's an indicator of willingness. Some NGOs are more picky: their validation is, therefore, worth more. </p> <p>\u2022 <strong>They take that extra, obsessive step</strong><br>Evangelistically green companies such as Lush, Co-operative Food or Sawdays can never resist the chance to talk about the environment, and they've all taken radical steps within their own organisations. Lush uses minimal amounts of packaging and gives money to anti-road groups, Co-operative Food has clad its entire HQ in solar panels, and Sawdays publishers operates from zero-carbon offices. </p> <p>\u2022 <strong>They are green innovators</strong><br>DIY Kyoto came up with the Wattson, a device for measuring how much electricity your house is using. BSkyB, headed by James Murdoch, has brought in the auto-standby device, which senses if the box hasn't been used in the two hours after 11pm, and automatically goes to standby.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>They set themselves targets</strong><br>Quantifiable targets set for some specific time in the future - \"we will reduce our water use by such and such by 2010\" - are an indicator of seriousness: they are handing you and the press a stick to beat them with if they miss the target. In January, Tesco, for example, pledged to reduce its carbon footprint by 50% by 2020. </p> <p>\u2022 <strong>They take action even if it may harm business</strong><br>Marks &amp; Spencer's decision to charge for plastic bags, British Gas's encouragement of reduced use: these are not immediately obvious comfort zones for money-making enterprises. You can be cynical, or you can clap. </p> <p>\u2022 <strong>They have been audited</strong><br>Some companies get a third party in to check they're doing it right: Eurostar called in Environmental Resources Management (ERM) to go over their plans with a toothcomb before they kicked off their big Tread Lightly initiative. Some companies - the Guardian, for example - are so obsessive they will even audit their social report. This could be seen as just showing off. </p> <p>\u2022 <strong>They make it easy for you to find all this out </strong><br>If you can't easily find the information, be suspicious and ring up the company.

  "<p>Go on, you can say it - recession. It doesn't sound anywhere near as bad as \"global financial meltdown\" or \"depression\" or \"the end of days\", does it? And now, after months of worry, we have something that all the wealth in the world couldn't buy: a sense of closure. From here on in all we need to do is adjust our outlook - a little less Gomorrah, a little more High School Musical 3.</p> <p>Still, there are tough times ahead, times when even the wealthiest among us will feel the pinch. But there is good news for any former millionaires now finding it difficult to walk the walk. In the wake of the pronounced economic slowdown - sorry, \"recession\" - many companies are now offering the trappings of super-wealth for hire. Priceless watches can be rented for the weekend, designer handbags by the month, luxury yachts by the day and labradors by the hour. You can hire a short-term butler or, if you're really pressed for cash, you can work as one. Either way it's encouraging to see that services that were once the preserve of fraudsters are now available to formerly wealthy people desperate to keep up appearances. But there are yet niches to fill: posh independent school uniform hire, DIY Damien Hirst installation kits, signed thank-you notes from Peter Mandelson. Get going, downturn opportunists! The <br>nouveaux pauvres need you.</p> <p><strong>Recession-busting tip: </strong>Libraries were once forbidding, silent places filled with people trying to read, but these days they have hardly any books in them, and talking is positively encouraged.

  "<p>A weak pound helped GlaxoSmithKline post growth in revenues and earnings per share that exceeded expectations despite falling sales in the US as a result of increased competition from generic equivalent drugs. </p> <p>The company said yesterday that its turnover grew 7% to \u00a35.88bn while earnings per share rose 6% to 25.2p in the third quarter. But on constant exchange rate terms, the company saw a decline of 3% in sales overall and 13% in US sales as many of its products reached the \"generic cliff\" - the point at which the patent runs out and other companies are free to manufacture similar products. The company expects to record a loss in sales for the full year in the mid-single digit range. </p> <p>The results came as another big pharmaceuticals firm, Merck, said it would slash 7,200 jobs - more than 12% of its workforce - in a restructuring programme. The New Jersey-based drugmaker's third-quarter profit dropped 28%, partly as a result of flat sales. Generic competition also played a part. </p> <p>Meanwhile Pfizer, the world's leading pharmaceuticals company, said this week that US consumption of Lipitor, its best-selling cholesterol drug, had fallen 13%. With research company IMS Health reporting that the number of prescriptions dispensed fell for the first time in a decade in the US, concern is rising that even stable sectors such as pharmaceuticals cannot escape the difficulties in the US retail market.</p> <p>\"We will need to monitor closely the impact that changes in the global economy will have on consumer demand for products,\" said Glaxo's chief executive officer, Andrew Witty. The company would look to build on its \"diversified business model\" to disburse the risk. He added: \"It's clearly more tricky in the United States than emerging markets, with Europe being somewhere in between.\"</p> <p>Glaxo's consumer healthcare business made sales of \u00a3994m, a 4% growth at a constant rate. Sales in Asia-Pacific/Japan grew 5%, and last week the company bought the Egyptian division of Bristol-Myers Squibb for \u00a3120m, making it the biggest drug seller in that country.</p> <p>A Glaxo spokeswoman said the company's core business had not been affected too badly by the financial crisis, adding that sales for the company's asthma drug Advair were up 7% overall and 5% in the US. She said: \"It's more the consumer healthcare segment that has seen a modest decline in sales, since it's more dynamic in nature.\"</p> <p>Glaxo said this month it was planning to cut 850 research and development jobs in Britain and the US in an attempt to improve efficiency and productivity. At the time, Witty told investors the industry faced a series of challenges as an increasing number of products lost patent protection, funders sought more cost-effective healthcare and patients demanded new and better medicines.</p> <p>Yesterday, the European Association for the Study of Diabetes and the American Diabetes Association stopped recommending the use of Glaxo's drug Avandia, in a revision of the international guidelines it had set down in 2006. There has been a sharp fall in sales for the drug, which is used to treat type 2 diabetes, after it was linked to risk of heart attack in a pooled analysis of clinical studies.</p>",
  "<p>The pound fell to its lowest level in five years against the dollar yesterday after Bank of England governor Mervyn King's warning that the economy was entering a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/recession\">recession</a> caused a flight from sterling.</p> <p>At one point the pound fell to just above $1.62, a 19% drop from the $2 a pound would buy as recently as July and the lowest level since late 2003. It had fallen 3% on the day and is now on course for its biggest weekly fall since being ejected from the European exchange rate mechanism in 1992.</p> <p>The pound is 25% lower against the dollar than a year ago and 16% lower against the euro at around 79p.</p> <p>The pound's fall will mean dearer holidays for Britons travelling abroad but will make British firms' exports cheaper in foreign markets. It will also blunt some of the impact of falling oil prices, which are denominated in dollars, on the price of petrol at the pump.</p> <p>King acknowledged in a speech late on Tuesday that the economy was facing the risk of a \"sharp and prolonged slowdown in domestic demand\" and was probably already in recession. He became the first senior official to admit what many economists have been saying for a while.</p> <p>\"King didn't really say anything we didn't already know, but if people were looking to sell sterling then it was as good an excuse as any,\" said Neil Mellor, strategist at Bank of New York Mellon in London. </p> <p>The prime minister followed King's lead yesterday: \"Having taken action on the banking system, we must now take action on the global financial recession which is likely to cause recession in America, France, Italy, Germany, Japan and - because no country can insulate itself from it - Britain too,\" Gordon Brown told the Commons.</p> <p>Economists at the Swiss investment bank UBS forecast yesterday that Britain would suffer the deepest recession of any major economy, with its economy contracting by 1.4% next year, as the effects of the financial crisis are compounded by a \"collapsing\" housing market. They also predicted recession in the eurozone and the United States. </p> <p>The gloomy tone of King's words was continued in minutes released yesterday of the monetary policy committee meeting on October 8 which showed members voted unanimously in favour of the unprecedented, emergency half-point interest rate cut as the financial system teetered on the brink of collapse.</p> <p>King and the other eight committee members all agreed that half a percentage point should be lopped off rates as part of a coordinated cut by central banks around the world, including the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. The cut took UK rates down to 4.5%.</p> <p>The MPC minutes said: \"Given the global nature of the financial market turbulence, there was a strong argument for participating in the proposed coordinated international action.\" </p> <p>Analysts believe that more cuts will be made next month, with some predicting that rates will be slashed to 2% by next year.</p> <p>Philip Shaw at Investec said: \"It's not at all surprising that the vote to cut rates by 50 basis points was unanimous. The committee is talking about the evidence being clearly sufficient to justify a half point which hints that another fall in rates seems likely in November - particularly given the continued run of bad economic news.\"</p> <p>Britain was not the only country facing a sharp decline in its currency. The Hungarian authorities jacked up interest rates by three percentage points yesterday, taking them to 11.5%, as it tried to prevent a big slide in the value of the forint, which has tumbled 16% against the euro since the summer. \"The financial crisis is now moving from the west to the east,\" said Andrew Milligan, economist at Standard Life Investments.</p> <h2>At a glance</h2> <p><strong>Pros</strong></p> <p>Rebalancing of economy: exports will be cheaper and imports pricier - helping narrow Britain's huge trade gap </p> <p>Companies: earn more abroad</p> <p><strong>Cons</strong></p> <p>Holidays abroad: shopping trips to the US more pricey; travel firms may levy a surcharge</p> <p>Fuel: oil priced in dollars so people and businesses in the UK will not feel the full benefit of its recent fall</p> <p>Shopping: imports pricier - bad for Christmas shoppers and retail sector</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown bowed to the inevitable and admitted yesterday that Britain was about to go into recession for the first time in 16 years. He did so as he highlighted new plans to persuade <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/mortgages\">mortgage</a> lenders not seek to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/repossessions\">repossess</a> the homes of borrowers unable to pay their arrears. </p> <p>In the Commons Brown followed the example of the chairman of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, and said the country had to prepare for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/recession\">recession</a>. </p> <p>Brown told MPs: \"Having taken action on the banking system, we must now take action on the global financial recession.\"</p> <p>He said this was likely to cause \"recession in America, France, Italy, Germany, Japan and - because no country can insulate itself from it - Britain too\".</p> <p>The Conservative party leader, David Cameron, tried to make Brown shoulder some of the blame for Britain's economic malaise, and pointed out that half of the OECD countries were going into the downturn with budget surpluses, making it possible for them to cut taxes for families. </p> <p>\"He claimed the credit in the boom, why won't he take responsibility in the bust?\" Cameron said.</p> <p>Britain will not formally go into recession when the latest growth figures are published tomorrow because there was zero growth as opposed to negative growth in the previous quarter. A recession is technically defined as two successive quarters of negative growth. </p> <p>Brown announced that in the wake of the downturn fresh guidance was being issued to judges to try to reduce the 40,000 repossessions forecast for this year. The Treasury announced new court protocols from the Civil Justice Council designed to make repossessions a last resort.</p> <p>Lenders will now be expected to demonstrate to courts that they have tried to discuss and agree alternatives to repossession when borrowers get into trouble with their mortgage repayments. If a case reaches court, lenders will be required to tell the court precisely what they have done to comply with the protocol. </p> <p>Lenders, under the new guidance, coming into force on November 19, must explore options to help people stay in their home, such as extending their mortgage term, changing the type of mortgage they have, such as switching people to an interest only one, deferring the payment of interest and adding arrears to the overall loan. One of the toughest lenders in terms of repossession has been Northern Rock, owned by the government. </p> <p>In addition the government is proposing that companies engaged in sale and rent back schemes, which may target vulnerable homeowners, should be brought under FSA regulation for the first time. The government is following a recommendation from the Office of Fair Trading.</p> <p>Buoyed by two new opinion polls showing his personal standing is rising, Brown was also complimented by the French president, Nicholas Sarkozy, who proposed that the prime minister be asked to regularly attend meetings of the euro-group of countries over the next year. </p> <p>Brown will also attend a meeting of world leaders on the economy announced yesterday by President Bush for Washington on November 15, 11 days after the US presidential election.</p> <p>A fresh poll by Ipsos MORI shows Labour up six points to 30 points and the Conservatives down seven points to 45 points, with the Liberal Democrats on 14 points up two.

Pre-tax profits rose by 30% to more than $14bn but the company, which has a monopoly on exports from Russia, admitted that the global liquidity squeeze would make life harder.</p> <p>\"Such circumstances could affect the ability of the group to obtain new borrowings and refinance its existing borrowings at terms and conditions similar to those applied to earlier transactions,\" Gazprom said in a statement. </p> <p>\"Deteriorating operating conditions for borrowers may also have an impact on management's cashflow forecasts and assessment of the impairment of financial and non-financial assets.\" </p> <p>Gazprom's chief executive, Alexei Miller, said this month that he saw no short-term risks from the global financial crisis as his company was enjoying record gas prices and had no urgent need to borrow. Analysts also said the company's debts of $40bn were still relatively small, given the profits generated and the scale of its business.</p> <p>But Artyom Konchin, an analyst at Aton Capital in Moscow, said Gazprom's share price had slumped 70%, valuing the group at $100bn, in part because it had failed to convince investors that the scale of investments it wanted to make could be justified at a time when demand could be hit by the global economic slowdown. \"Minority investors in particular want to know where the value is coming from,\" he added.</p> <p>Gazprom, which supplies a quarter of Europe's gas, announced on Monday that it was establishing a \"big gas troika\" with Iran and Qatar. It was described by the Iranian oil minister Gholamhossein Nozari as a \"gas Opec\".</p> <p>David Clark, a former special adviser to the Foreign Office and a chairman of the UK-based Russia Foundation, said he was alarmed by the move. \"It is a clear attempt by Russia and other countries to increase their leverage and use energy as a geopolitical weapon. It is time the European Union ensured that Russia was bound by a rules-based relationship that it had signed up to with the energy charter treaty.\" </p> <p>Clark said it was ominous that the three countries involved in the potential cartel specifically talked about liquefied natural gas (LNG). \"They clearly realise that LNG offers gas-importing countries different supply options and is an area they want to control,\" he added.</p> <p>The European commission said it would expect to be notified of any move to create such an arrangement, which could prompt the EU to revise its energy policy. </p> <p>\"In principle, the commission is against cartels for the sale and marketing of products, and hydrocarbons are no exception to that,\" the commission's energy spokesman, Ferr\u00e1n Tarradellas Espuny, said. \"We believe the best conditions for the sale of a product such as gas are a free and transparent market.\" </p> <p>Two of Europe's biggest gas distributors, GDF Suez and E.ON, said the troika could be useful. </p> <p>G\u00e9rard Mestrallet, chief executive of GDF Suez, France's biggest gas utility, said: \"We have the feeling that the forum project is not necessarily a cartel - if it was we would condemn it - but that it is a place for dialogue and we would be prepared to regard it favourably.\"</p> <p>Bernhard Reutersberg, E.ON Ruhr gas chairman, said he was not \"really\" concerned as his company was shielded by long-term supply contracts.</p>",
  "<h2>Donors pledge $4.5bn to rebuild war-torn Georgia</h2> <p>The EU, the United States and other international donors have pledged more than $4.5bn (\u00a32.8bn) for rebuilding parts of Georgia that were damaged in its war with Russia in August, officials said yesterday. The $3.7bn for public expenditure and $850m for the private sector \"exceeded expectations\", EU external relations commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner said, following a donor conference in Brussels. According to early estimates, the total cost of war damage was $1bn - but that was estimated before the current financial crisis and threat of global recession.<br><strong>Associated Press in Brussels</strong></p> <h2>University forced to scrap speech by Iranian activist</h2> <p>A Kuala Lumpur university scrapped an invitation for Iranian Nobel laureate Shirin Ebadi to give a speech about Islam after Iranian diplomats warned the event could hurt bilateral ties, an official said yesterday. Ebadi, who won the peace prize in 2003 for working for greater rights for women and children in Iran, has often been at odds with Tehran and her Centre for Protecting Human Rights has been banned. Ebadi was to speak at the University of Malaya but the Malaysian foreign ministry wrote to organisers \"strongly advising\" them not to host her, an organising official said. <br><strong>AP in Kuala Lumpur</strong></p> <h2>Nine die in 'mistaken' US strike on army checkpoint</h2> <p>A US-led coalition air strike hit an Afghan army checkpoint in Khost province yesterday, killing nine soldiers and wounding three, Afghan officials said. The US said its forces \"may have mistakenly killed and injured\" Afghan soldiers in a possible case of mistaken identity \"on both sides\". The US said a convoy was involved in \"multiple engagements\" as it returned from an operation. \"As a result of the engagements, ANA [Afghan army] soldiers were killed and injured.\" In a similar incident in June 2007 seven Afghan police were killed in a US air strike after the police mistakenly opened fire on US troops. <br><strong>Associated Press in Kabul</strong></p>",
  "<p>Home Retail Group, which controls Homebase and Argos, has crashed into the red.</p> <p>The retailer slumped to a first-half loss of \u00a3437m after writing down more than half a billion pounds from the value of Homebase. The write-down, which had been flagged, is an admission that HRG paid too much for the retailer. It bought the business from the private-equity group Permira for \u00a3900m in 2002.</p> <p>Even without the write-down, profits for the six months to the end of August were well down, falling 22% to \u00a3106m, with a 14% decline at Argos and a 37% slump at Homebase.</p> <p>Terry Duddy, chief executive, warned that trading conditions had \"worsened in recent weeks\". Like-for-like sales at Argos and Homebase are down about 9% on 2007 levels. If there is no pick-up in trade, he said, profits would be at the bottom of City expectations, at some \u00a3327m, compared with \u00a3426m last year. The dividend payout, however, has been maintained.</p> <p>\"We have had like-for-like sales at negative levels in Argos that we have never seen before,\" he said. \"The worst week was in mid-September, when the Lloyds TSB-HBOS merger deal went through.\"</p> <p>The outlook for retailers, he said, was \"depressing\". Planning, he added, was particularly difficult because \"we have never had a period where there has been so much lack of clarity\".</p> <p>The retailer is clamping down on costs. New stores have been put on hold to reduce capital expenditure and the hours worked by staff in stores have been cut by 20%. \"Will I say there won't be any job losses going forward?\" Duddy said. \"That's not possible.\" </p> <p>Duddy said the figures proved that all income groups were being hit by the downturn because all income groups shopped at Argos. \"About 70% of UK households have shopped with us in the last 12 months and are they being hit hard? Yes, they are,\" he said.</p> <p>\"People have been saying 'what has happened to my savings?' and 'what has happened to my pension?' The next thing is going to be 'what is going to happen to my job?' So it is not surprising there's a certain lack of confidence.\"</p> <p>HRG also said it would be harder to keep prices down on general merchandise - goods that are neither food nor clothing. Half of all general merchandise sold in Britain is made in China and the far east. \"We are not going to be able to buy currency cheaper; we are not going to get freight costs cheaper or source the product any cheaper,\" Duddy said. </p> <p>The HRG boss's gloomy outlook came as the market research group Verdict said that retailers were facing \"the toughest trading environment ever\".</p> <p>Verdict is predicting consumer spending growth of 2% in the last three months of this year - compared with 3.1% last year - a rise that will be almost entirely due to inflation in food prices. Neil Saunders, Verdict director, said sales and margins would take a hit and warned retailers that they would have to \"work an awful lot harder than they have done\".</p> <p>HRG shares closed up 2.75p at 196.75p. A year ago they were at 436p.</p> <p>David Jeary, an Investec analyst, still rates the shares a buy. \"As the latest trading update shows, the group is not immune from pressures of consumer demand, but we believe its relative performance will be superior to other bigger-ticket retailers.\"</p> <p>However, Sam Hart at the broker Charles Stanley is urging investors to reduce their holdings. \"The risk remains on the downside. The risk of a dividend cut also appears to be increasing.\"</p>",
  "<p>The satellite broadcaster <strong>BSkyB</strong> fell sharply yesterday on concern that hard-hit consumers might cancel their pay-TV contracts. The impetus for this seems to be a survey of 1,022 people by Continental Research, which found 10% planned to end their subscriptions. </p> <p>Analysts at Kaupthing said: \"Clearly this is ugly stuff if this turns out to be the case, and surely sentiment will worsen as consumers come under pressure on income.\" But Daniel Kerven at UBS was less concerned: \"Without being able to compare [the survey] against a previous study, it is difficult to draw any conclusion from this.

  "<p>As the dust of the credit crash clears and the real world recession kicks in, the ideologues of capitalism are scaring themselves with spectres. \"He's back,\" the Times warned its readers on Tuesday over a portrait of Karl Marx. Not only are sales of his masterwork Das Kapital booming, but the virus of the newly fashionable revolutionary has, it seems, spread to the heart of the capitalist camp: the French president Nicolas Sarkozy has had himself photographed leafing through its pages while Marx's analysis of capitalism has been hailed by everyone from the German finance minister to the Pope.</p> <p>In the US, John McCain has been lashing out at Barack Obama for his supposed \"socialism\", the High Tory writer Simon Heffer excitedly dubbed the state bail-out of the banks \"neo-sovietisation\", and the BBC broadcast a prime-time debate last week on whether the crisis signalled the \"death of capitalism\". Meanwhile the Economist, the Pravda of the neoliberal ascendancy, has been trying to mobilise true believers for a fightback: \"Economic liberty is under attack\", its current issue thunders. \"Capitalism is at bay, but those who believe in it must fight for it.\"</p> <p>Of course, they are running ahead of themselves in a panic. If Marx's central ideas about class and exploitation were really taking hold across the western world, you can be sure the mainstream media wouldn't be running quirky, cartoonish pieces and debates about them, but something much more ferocious and alarming. </p> <p>It's certainly true that the events of the past few weeks have exposed deregulated capitalism as bankrupt and its ruling elites as greedy and inept. But it is the free-market model, not capitalism, that is dying. That is reflected in public opinion: a Financial Times-Harris poll conducted across the advanced capitalist world this month found large majorities believe the financial crisis has been caused by \"abuses of capitalism\", rather than the \"failure of capitalism itself\" - only in Germany did the proportion blaming capitalism as a system rise to 30%. </p> <p>As Sarkozy has pronounced: \"Laissez-faire is finished.\" It is not Marx who has really been rehabilitated in short order, but John Maynard Keynes, out of dire necessity. In the wake of the largest-scale acts of state economic intervention in capitalist history, politicians are now having to make a virtue of it. \"Much of what Keynes wrote still makes sense,\" the chancellor Alistair Darling declared at the weekend, as he announced plans to bring forward large capital projects and the prime minister defended higher borrowing to counter falling demand. </p> <p>The symbolic significance of this official return to Keynesianism shouldn't be underestimated. It's 32 years since the then Labour prime minister Jim Callaghan bowed the knee to monetarism, nearly three years before Margaret Thatcher came to power, and announced to his party conference: \"We used to believe that we could spend our way out of a crisis, but I tell you ... it is no longer possible.\" Faced with financial collapse and the threat of a full-scale economic depression, such fancies have now had to be consigned to the dustbin of history.</p> <p>But claims that the current crisis signals the end of capitalism or the birth of a new socialism simply set up a straw man and divert attention from what is in fact at stake. If we're talking about socialism as a systemic alternative, that is clearly not currently on the agenda in the heartlands of capitalism - or elsewhere, with the arguable exception of Latin America. And both its post-communist collapse of confidence and the weakening of the working class as a social and political force make it difficult for the left to take full advantage of capitalism's stark failures.</p> <p>That has led some, such as the historian Eric Hobsbawm, to conclude that the main beneficiaries of the crisis will be the right, as in the 1930s. There's certainly a danger of growing support for rightwing populism on the back of mass unemployment; but if the new enthusiasm for Keynesian intervention and public ownership can be channelled to protect those most vulnerable to the crash - rather than make them pay the price for it, as now seems more likely - that need not be the case.</p> <p>What the crisis is bound to do is increase the demand for alternatives both within capitalism and beyond it. It has already discredited the economic model that has dominated the world for a generation at a cost of endemic instability, rampant inequality and environmental devastation. In its defence of free-market capitalism this week, the Economist argued that, in the past 25 years of market liberalisation, hundreds of millions of people have been lifted out of absolute poverty and speculated that this decade may see the fastest growth of income per head in history.</p> <p>But most of that growth and poverty reduction has been in China's state-directed and still heavily publicly-owned economy, while India's lesser capitalist success story is so grotesquely unequally distributed that the proportion of its children who are malnourished - at 47% a global leader - has remained almost unchanged for a decade. For the rest of the world, growth was faster and far more equally shared in the postwar decades of Keynesianism and socialism. </p> <p>An opportunity has now opened up for those political leaders prepared to use this meltdown to reshape the economic system, from Obama to Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. It's often said that the left has no alternative model after the implosion of communism and traditional social democracy. But in reality no economic and social model, left or right, has ever come pre-cooked: all of them - from Soviet power to the Keynesian welfare state and Thatcherite-Reaganite neoliberalism - have grown out of ideologically driven improvisation in particular historical circumstances. Marx himself famously offered no blueprint.</p> <p>Instead, the pressure to respond to economic need - as in the New Deal or postwar Europe - will shape the way the new economic order develops. Already, the forms of intervention have been sharply different from past crises, with bank nationalisations offering a potentially powerful new economic lever. We are no doubt heading into a new kind of capitalism as well as a period of growing support for more far-reaching social alternatives. But what form it takes will be decided by pressure, from above and below.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:s.milne@theguardian.com\">s.milne@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Once it was the Kremlin that came begging to people like George Osborne for cash. In the old cold war, it secretly sold off the Soviet Union's gold reserves to pay for desperately needed grain imports. Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin sought bail-out after bail-out from the west, strongly backed by Margaret Thatcher and John Major. Now it is the other way round: Russia sits on a vast pile of cash, and we are selling principles and self-respect.</p> <p>Even before the financial crisis, London was the global leader in the respectability business: offering rich Russians the chance to turn their ill-gotten billions into prestige. Whether you wanted an entree to high society or to popular culture, British go-betweens and highly paid PR barons were willing to provide it. Buy a football team, sponsor a charity, or make a hefty donation to a posh boarding school - and you suddenly gain the right upmarket cachet. In exchange for what are to them trivial amounts of cash, the numerous oligarchs bought priceless respectability and safety. As fugitives from Russia found, Britain is a safe place - police and bodyguards work smoothly together; Russian extradition warrants count for little.</p> <p>In retrospect, that respectability was sold rather cheaply. With the war in Chechnya and imposition of state control on Russia's once pluralist media still in full swing, the British establishment decided that Russia under Vladimir Putin was a place to do business. The Russian tycoons - some of them ex-gangsters or ex-KGB - were seen as at worst a bit roguish. Tony Blair went for nights at the opera with his \"friend\" Mr Putin, the undertaker of Russia's political freedom. Britain's elite - the Rothschilds and Murdochs, even minor members of the House of Windsor - hobnobbed lavishly and sometimes lucratively with the \"new Russians\". </p> <p>Those who found their eyebrows rising or their stomachs heaving were told not to be so fuddy-duddy. Surely we should be glad that Russia was now roughly on the right track: rough capitalist diamonds are better than communist coals. Those who refused to play along soon got discreet warnings about the litigiousness of London's new elite.</p> <p>The banks, accountants and law firms joined the rush to the trough. Instead of upholding the principles - however shaky - on which our financial system is based, they have entered into the fray of Russian business, and connived in its attempts to subvert and evade those principles. Companies that are little more than criminal conspiracies, stealing billions of dollars from the Russian people for the benefit of unnamed shareholders, have their accounts signed off by our finest auditors. Top lawyers help them to conceal their identities and bombproof their business models. Bankers handle the cash and manage the dense web of offshore companies that conceal a trail pointing tantalisingly back to the Kremlin.</p> <p>In the shadows of Whitehall, officials are aghast at the way in which Russian money is buying friends and influence in our politics, public administration, independent regulatory bodies and businesses - particularly energy. All three parties have parliamentarians who are loyal members of the Kremlin chorus. British Tories, for instance, supported an attempt to make the former KGB man Mikhail Margelov president of the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe. </p> <p>But the Lib Dems, and particularly Labour, have little to be proud of either, as the fracas over Oleg Deripaska shows. It is not just the unsolicited non-donation to the Conservative party that is so shocking. It is that anybody claiming respectability in British public life thought it appropriate to have even social dealings with oligarchs like Mr Deripaska - who rose to power and riches first in the aluminium business in the 1990s, which witnessed some terrifying violence, and then at the court of Mr Putin.</p> <p>But even so, it cannot have escaped the notice of Peter Mandelson or George Osborne that Mr Deripaska is a man unable to enter the United States. A private briefing from the FBI - easily arranged in London - would have revealed that American officials are unhappy with some of Mr Deripaska's business associates.</p> <p>Mr Deripaska's defenders point out that he has never faced any criminal charges and blame his visa difficulties on unsubstantiated allegations from rivals. Moreover, Mr Deripaska has himself denied any wrongdoing in this and other controversies. </p> <p>A brief chat to informed British officials should have made it abundantly clear to Messrs Osborne and Rothschild, as well as Lord Mandelson, that dealings with Mr Deripaska should be limited, formal and cautious.</p> <p>The British governing class has not just mislaid its moral antenna. It has also forgotten that Russia is a national security threat: a point underlined repeatedly and publicly by MI5. Nato is now making contingency plans to defend its members from Russian attack for the first time since the end of the old cold war. Yet on the home front, we seem to have surrendered without a fight.</p> <p>\u2022 Edward Lucas is the author of The New Cold War: How the Kremlin Menaces Russia and the West <br><a href=\"http://edwardlucas.blogspot.com\">edwardlucas.blogspot.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The stricken US bank Wachovia reported yesterday the biggest quarterly loss of any bank since the onset of the credit crunch.</p> <p>The $24bn (\u00a314.7bn) of losses amount to more than the total price being paid for the North Carolina lender by its rival Wells Fargo, which was last night playing down the impact of the figures on the combined business.</p> <p>The losses for the three months to the end of September - which compare with earnings of $1.62bn in the same quarter last year - were caused by an $18.8bn write-down on the value of loans and securities and a further $4.8bn to cover losses expected in the future.</p> <p>The loss is even greater than the $12bn reported by the Swiss bank UBS in the first quarter, one of the biggest losses recorded since the US sub-prime mortgage crisis started to reverberate around financial markets a year ago.</p> <p>Robert Steel, Wachovia's president and chief executive, said: \"Although this has been a challenging quarter, Wachovia's underlying businesses remain solid and our franchise exceptionally attractive. We look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead as we join forces with Wells Fargo.\" He added: \"The market environment changed more precipitously than anyone had expected.\" </p> <p>Steel was forced to seek a saviour for Wachovia earlier this month, just weeks after insisting the bank was strong enough to remain independent. </p> <p>The losses at Wachovia helped knock sentiment in the wider stockmarket yesterday, which was unnerved by concerns over the US economy. The Dow Jones industrial average was off as much as 400 points by mid-afternoon in New York. Shares in Wells Fargo were knocked following the news from Wachovia.</p> <p>Wachovia was running into trouble even before the collapse of investment bank Lehman Brothers last month. Many of its woes stem from its decision to buy the Californian mortgage lender Golden West Financial two years ago at the height of the housing boom and now causing the write-downs that have driven it deep into the red. Wachovia has written off $6.6bn in credit losses arising from the acquisition of Golden West Financial - and the housing woes are far from over. It has also forecast $26.1bn in mortgage-related losses next year.</p> <p>Giving an insight into the US housing market, Wachovia said that in an area of California south-east of San Francisco, borrowers owe an average of 66% more on their loans than their homes are worth.</p> <p>After the collapse of Lehman Brothers caused mayhem in the financial markets, the US government stepped in to help Wachovia by agreeing to limit its losses to allow a rescue takeover of its retail banking operations by Citigroup.</p> <p>But just four days later Wells Fargo jumped in with a bid for the whole bank, winning the support of the Wachovia board. After threatening legal action at having its plans thwarted, Citigroup decided to walk away.</p> <p>John Stumpf, president and chief executive of Wells Fargo, stood by the deal yesterday despite the grim figures. \"Wachovia's third-quarter results were very much in line with our expectations,\" he said. \"We're more encouraged than ever by what we've seen in their franchise and we're pleased that Wachovia's team continues to focus on serving customers,\" he added.</p> <p>Wells Fargo, which structured the deal without the need for the guarantees offered to Citigroup, initially agreed to pay $15bn for Wachovia. But the offer is decreasing in value in line with the fall in the Wells Fargo share price and is now worth closer to $14bn.</p> <p>Wells Fargo is planning to raise $20bn of new capital once the deal is completed and insisted yesterday that these plans would not be affected by Wachovia's woes.</p> <p>But the precarious conditions in the financial markets and the weakening condition of Wachovia has encouraged the Fed to hasten the approval of the deal.</p> <p>Profits in Wachovia's retail banking division fell 48% to $857m, while its corporate and investment bank lost $703m, compared with a $212m profit in the same quarter last year. The capital-management arm lost $499m.</p>",
  "<p>Earlier this week I spent a long and, in every sense of the word, sober lunch in a trattoria in Turin with fellow jury members at the world's longest running environmental film festival, Cinemambiente, now in its 11th year. Each of us had dutifully watched the 10 shortlisted films, but how do you even begin to choose between films about, say, the societal and environmental influence of the new market economy in Mongolia, the imperialistic excesses of western gold miners in Guinea or the men who break up ships by hand on the oil-stained beaches of Bangladesh for a dollar a day?</p> <p>After three hours of hearty, if sometimes circular, debate we finally settled on a winner. The Nuclear Comeback is a documentary by New Zealand filmmaker Justin Pemberton, weighing up the pros and cons of nuclear energy in a world that urgently needs to decarbonise its economy. On paper, this sounds quite a worthy film - dull, even - but Pemberton achieves a rare feat. God only knows how he persuaded them, but the authorities at Chernobyl allowed him to film inside the now abandoned, highly radioactive control room and inner core. It is thought to be the first time a western film crew has ever been allowed so far inside. In one angst-ridden scene, Pemberton turns to his guide and asks him whether it's still safe to proceed when the radiation detector pinned to his jacket begins to bleep furiously. He is casually told to walk on.</p> <p>Pemberton also manages to get nuclear officials in Britain to admit on film that no one really knows what to do with the spent nuclear fuel that will remain radioactive \"for at least 100,000 years\". Yet equal time is given to those who argue that we don't really have much choice now other than to go nuclear. Like the best documentaries, it is engaging, nuanced and avoids preaching its cause.</p> <p>\"Balance is everything,\" says my fellow juror Ray McCormack, the Irish director of award-winning documentary A Crude Awakening: the Oil Crash. \"It was far more effective getting someone from the industry spelling out the dangers of nuclear energy than someone from Greenpeace,\" he says. </p> <p>Other environmental films that have impressed McCormack include Workingman's Death, The Future of Food and The Animals Film, which showed on Channel 4's first night. \"I've been a vegetarian ever since.\" </p> <p>Every film-maker wants the viewer to care passionately about their issue by the time the credits roll. But, sadly, good environmental films rarely make the light of day. At best, they are destined for a late-night slot on BBC4 - and that's the successful ones. </p> <p>\"Every year I watch about 1,000 environmental shorts, animations and features from around the world before choosing the shortlist for my festival,\" says Hey-Rim Hwang, programmer for the Green film festival in Seoul and another fellow juror. \"I've seen them all - good, bad and ugly. Lots of western documentaries about the exploitation of natural resources in Africa, for example, are very one-dimensional. They don't address the colonialistic attitudes of the exploiters.\" Among the best she's seen are When Clouds Clear, about a community in Ecuador battling copper miners, and Encounters at the End of the World by Werner Herzog. \"Sadly, neither are that well-known to a wider public.\"</p> <p>Ask any cinema-goer to name their favourite environmental film, and you are unlikely to get much further than An Inconvenient Truth, Al Gore's Oscar-winning, yet deeply dividing film about global warming. It did a wonderful job in popularising the topic - hence the Nobel prize - but it hasn't exactly led to a wave of environmental documentaries being signed up for distribution.</p> <p>Some of the films with the most effective green messages, however, have been big-budget movies. Children and adults have lapped up Hollywood animations such as Happy Feet, Finding Nemo and Wall-E, without necessarily noticing that they are watching a powerful condemnation of, say, the damage industrial-scale trawlers are doing to global fish stocks.</p> <p>Science fiction has also provided some strong environmental statements about where humanity might be headed if we don't address some of today's problems. I was transfixed by Logan's Run as a child, and the bleak vision it painted of a world nearly destroyed by overpopulation and pollution. (A more influential film from the same era is Soylent Green.) The Day After Tomorrow might have been an often laughable Hollywood take on the perils of global warming, but it brought the issue to a wider audience than any political speech. </p> <p>Hollywood has also successfully dramatised the real-life stories of those who have fought for environmental causes with films such as Erin Brockovich, The Emerald Forest, Born Free, Gorillas in the Mist and Silkwood.</p> <p>But for me, the most powerful environmental film ever is an often-forgotten 1982 release with a near-unpronouncable title. Koyaanisqatsi, directed by Godfrey Reggio, shot by Ron Fricke and scored by Philip Glass, is a haunting meditation on the fraught relationship between humanity, technology and the natural environment. It combines striking imagery with a mind-changing message. </p> <p>Any good environmental film, as we discussed in Turin, must boast such qualities if it is to truly influence its audience.</p>",

Then they rub our noses in it by selling what \"green electricity\" they do produce over and over again. <br>This is all within the law, of course. But that is because the government's green laws are a mess. In many cases, buying green electricity is not so much greenwash as a full-scale green con.  Certainly, that's the view of Virginia Graham, who six years ago drew up the first set of guidelines on green tariffs, for the industry regulator Ofgem. She is now wiser and more cynical. \"It suits the companies for people to think they are getting green electricity if they sign up to green tariffs,\" she says. \"But in most cases they are not, and people are being misled.\"</p> <p>Let me explain how the system works. Under government rules, electricity suppliers have to make sure that a certain percentage of their electricity is generated from renewable sources, like wind turbines, solar panels and burning wood or plants. This is called the renewables obligation.</p> <p>The percentage rises each year. For the year ending March 2007, the most recent for which there are published stats on how the companies performed, the obligation was 6.7%. But the companies collectively only managed to generate 4.7% of their electricity from renewables. </p> <p>Most of the big companies missed the target by a country mile. EDF managed 5%, E.On 3.6% and British Gas 4%.<br> This may not all be the fault of the suppliers. It would take another article to explain what has gone wrong with rolling out British renewables. But the fact remains that the suppliers are selling green energy, often at premium prices, to green-minded customers as if this were on top of their existing commitments. </p> <p>Npower's juice tariff offers \"clean green energy at no extra cost to you or the planet\". The company says it gets sufficient power from offshore windfarms to supply its juice customers. Maybe so. But according to its fuel-mix declaration, only 3% of its overall supplies were renewable last year \u2013 less than half its obligation.</p> <p>To shed some light on this mess, Ofgem, the industry regulator, has been talking to suppliers for over a year now about setting up a mandatory system of labelling and an independent auditor for green tariffs. </p> <p>But insiders say the industry has been watering down the proposals, and no amount of fussing over the detail is going to get round the central point. Power companies that do not meet their legal renewables obligations are telling porkies if they suggest that when you sign up for their green tariff, they will deliver more green electricity. It just isn't so. </p> <p>To be fair, some tariffs do offer something a bit more certain. They promise to plant a tree for you, or put money into research into renewables. The EDF green tariff, which advertises that it \"lets you choose renewable energy for your home\", funds solar panels on school roofs and similar projects.</p> <p>But until they meet their existing renewable obligations, and demonstrate that people buying green tariffs will push them beyond the legal minimum, they won't get an extra penny out of me. </p> <p>The story doesn't end there, however. You see, green electricity is not just for greens. Not even mainly for greens. The biggest buyers are companies. When their electricity comes with a green label, they have taken to going around calling themselves \"carbon neutral\". Which is good PR. BT has made great play of having cut its carbon emissions by more than half by buying green electricity. </p> <p>So levy payers have been very willing to pay premium prices to buy \"green electricity\". So keen, in fact, that they buy more green electricity than is being generated in the first place. It is hard to believe that this is possible within the law, but I am told it is. An electricity supplier that has access to, say, two gigawatt (GW) hours of renewable electricity, can sell 4GW-hours labelled as renewable, says Graham. \"Renewable electricity is often being sold twice, perhaps more. Double counting is enormous.\"</p> <p>The government may be starting to get a handle on all this. In August, the environment secretary, Hilary Benn, announced plans for a crackdown on companies making dodgy claims about their carbon neutrality.</p> <p>At this point, you might shrug your shoulders and walk away from this green fantasy land. But not so fast. Because it turns out we have been paying for it all. All electricity customers, regardless of what tariff they are on, pay an average premium on their bills of \u00a310 a year specifically to help pay the electricity suppliers meet their renewable obligations. </p> <p>We know they don't fully meet those obligations. But surely every scrap of green energy that they do produce is ours, paid for with our \u00a310. But instead they are selling it to others, several times over. In the end, the biggest con seems have been perpetrated not on the buyers of green electricity, but on the rest of us.</p> <p>\u2022 How many more green scams, cons and generous slices of wishful thinking are out there?

  "<p>President George Bush and fellow world leaders will attempt to thrash out a united response to the global financial crisis next month when Washington hosts an emergency summit.</p> <p>The meeting on November 15 will discuss the underlying causes of the downturn, the global response and the principles that will underpin any reforms, the White House said. Leaders from the group of leading economies - including Brazil, China and India as well as the G7 nations will attend the meeting, which will also seek input from the winner of the US presidential election.</p> <p>However, the White House acknowledged that the first meeting was unlikely to produce concrete proposals for tackling the consequences of the credit crunch. Although the world's biggest economies have followed Gordon Brown's lead in recapitalising their major banks, leaders have expressed divergent views on what future shape global finance should take.</p> <p>Bush has warned that any coordinated international action should preserve free markets but his French counterpart, Nicolas Sarkozy, declared last month that the \"all-powerful market that always knows best is dead\".</p> <p>Dana Perino, a White House spokesman, said she did not expect the summit to present firm decisions on new policy or regulation. The task of putting \"meat on the bones\" after the meeting will be up to financial experts in the world leaders' respective countries, Perino added. \"A lot of work will have to be done at the taskforce level, the working group level,\" she said. Those working groups will then draft recommendations for consideration at further summits.</p> <p>Barack Obama, favourite to win the election that takes place 11 days before the summit, welcomed the announcement by a Bush administration that is making one last push to stabilise the global economy before the new president takes office on January 20.</p>",
  "<p>Prime minister's questions yesterday were ostensibly about the economy. In fact the session was about George Osborne. The shadow chancellor, shiny and glistening as always, arrived to a supportive cheer from his own side - plus some mockery from Labour. </p> <p>He sat down on the bench and did what all politicians in his position are hard-wired to do - he smiled, chuckled and chatted to the chap next to him. The message is: \"Anything you say about me is just a joke, and I can laugh it off! Ha, ha!\"</p> <p>Isn't it revealing that these people, folk such as Osborne and Lord Mandelson, are supposed to be deadly political rivals, but are really dear, dear friends? </p> <p>We wouldn't have heard anything about this if Osborne hadn't shopped Mandelson after their meal at a \u00a350 a head taverna on Corfu. (Where do you find a \u00a350 a head taverna in Greece? Most people expect to pay \u20ac20 tops for a lavish meal, including all the retsina your stomach can stand. It's like finding a fifty-quid Burger King.)</p> <p>Choosing between these people and their ludicrously wealthy friends is as pointless as picking your favourite Kray twin, or deciding if you prefer George Osborne to Ozzy Osbourne.</p> <p>Gordon Brown got off to a bad start. He declared that the global crisis was creating recession in the US, Europe and Japan. \"And - because no country can insulate itself from it - Britain too.\"</p> <p>The notion that we were unlucky to be sucked into this problem, which normally wouldn't have affected us, dear me no, had the Tories laughing maniacally. </p> <p>The prime minister resembled someone who, hearing a hurricane is on the way, prudently packs an umbrella and is baffled when he still gets wet.</p> <p>David Cameron persisted in blaming him, and our national debt, for the pickle we are in. He has of course offered to help the government to get out of the hole we are all in, but is desperately anxious that everyone should realise who dug the hole in the first place.</p> <p>Then the Tory leader made his own mistake. </p> <p>\"He cannot lecture the banks on borrowing because he's been borrowing so much, and he cannot lecture them on transparency because he has been hiding so much.\"</p> <p>Hiding? Labour members thought this was a perfect opportunity to remind everyone about Mr Osborne, to whom they pointed and waved their arms. \"He is the master of dodgy accounting!\" shouted Mr Cameron, which delighted them yet more.</p> <p>The Tory leader switched tactics. He asked the prime minister to admit that he had not, as billed so often and so long, ended boom and bust. He asked him many times. </p> <p>Did he imagine that Brown would break down and whimper, \"Yes, you're right, I have failed the nation. I shall go to a quiet room with a service revolver and a bottle of ouzo\"? The prime minister ignored the question.</p> <p>Then we heard from Dennis Skinner, the old sea-green incorruptible, the last of the leftwing samurai. Mr Skinner resembles a Japanese soldier who, discovered in the jungle years after hostilities have ceased, tells the rescue party that he knows the war is over, but he doesn't care and will go on fighting anyway. \"Will the prime minister give a rock-solid assurance that whatever he does to clear the nation's debts, he will never, ever meet a Russian billionaire and try to cadge the money? We will leave that to the sleazy Tory party!\" he declared. He waved an angry arm.</p> <p>Normally Mr Skinner is greeted by an indulgent smile which means \"dear old Dennis, what a character!\" </p> <p>But Gordon Brown just grunted and said: \"This is a very serious matter, and I hope it will be investigated by the authorities.\"</p> <p>Quite what there is to investigate isn't entirely clear. </p> <p>\"Tories try to tap rich man for moolah; fail\" is not quite Watergate yet, though plenty of people - some of them Tories - are hoping that it will be.</p>",
  "<p>It used to be Two Jags who growled around Westminster in his limos. Now our politicians compete for the nickname Two Priuses. Cabinet Office minister Tom Watson has roared ahead in the eco-conscious motoring race by squeezing his red boxes into the first ever ministerial Mini. But the new big cabinet split is whether to choose a Jag or a Prius as an official car. Young cabinet ministers, such as James Purnell, Douglas Alexander and Ed Miliband, happily admit they use the petrol-electric Toyota, as does Hilary Benn, the environment secretary, and Hazel Blears. Three other cabinet members, including John Denham, also drive Honda hybrids.</p> <p>However, the seven-strong Prius group is still outnumbered by the nine cabinet ministers who take up the other official ministerial car option - the Jaguar XJ.</p> <p>You can bet those cabinet members who refuse to identify what they drive \"for security reasons\" use a Jaguar. Gordon Brown recently promised to swap his armour-plated Jaguar XJ limousine for an electric car but Peter Mandelson is an unrepentant Jag man. \"I insisted on being driven around Brussels in a British-made Jaguar and I'm still being driven around in a British Jaguar now,\" the new lord told a Commons committee this week.</p> <p>The Jag option may not be the eco-nightmare it was in Prescott's day. The diesel XJ bought by the government has been named the greenest luxury car for two years running. It is claimed the 2.7 model can travel 1,000 miles on a single tank of fuel although the government's official figures clock its CO2 emissions at 209g/km (more than double the 104g/km for the Prius and Mini diesel).</p> <p>Despite politicians watching their emissions - the ministerial average is 140.71g/km - the number of cars in the ministerial fleet has actually risen from 82 in 2005 to 87 today, including several Mondeos and Vectras.</p> <p>But the humblest motoring ministers must be the three cabinet members - including culture secretary Andy Burnham - who have stuck with a relic of the days when British-owned companies built cars in Britain: a Rover 75.</p>",
  "<p>UK car production rose last month but the industry is braced for a fall as more manufacturers introduce short-time working.</p> <p>Output climbed 2.4% to 142,606 cars last month although new registrations fell by more than a fifth, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.</p> <p>Paul Everitt, SMMT chief executive, said: \"We already know production is being scaled back to reflect demand in global markets and we will see this more clearly in the months ahead.\" Only about a fifth of vehicles produced in the UK are sold in the domestic market.</p> <p>This week Japan's Nissan became the latest manufacturer to curb its UK output, closing one of its two production lines in Sunderland for two weeks. </p> <p>Most automotive manufacturers in Britain have brought in measures to crimp production as the global downturn gathers pace. </p> <p>Everitt said it was impossible to forecast the extent to which companies would cut production, but he urged the industry to maintain its skills base and investment in research and development. He added that experience suggested companies cut back on investment in training and R&amp;D during a slump, but cautioned: \"We can't afford to do that. It is essential we protect our manufacturing capability.</p> <p>\"We don't want to lose valuable people and 18 months later find we are scrabbling round to find people again.\"</p> <p>Business and union leaders from the UK Commission for Employment and Skills are publishing an open letter today, appealing to British firms to continue investing in training during the downturn.</p> <p>The appeal has the backing of the skills secretary, John Denham, who said: \"It sends out a very strong message to British companies about surviving the economic downturn and it is all the more powerful coming from some of our most respected business and union leaders. We know companies that carry on investing in training their staff do better when the economy starts to pick up again.\"</p>",
  "<p>The world's biggest publicly funded project to make transport fuels from algae will be launched today by a government agency which develops low-carbon technologies.</p> <p>The Carbon Trust will today announce a project to make algal <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/biofuels\">biofuels</a> a commercial reality by 2020. The plan could see up to \u00a326m spent on developing the technology and infrastructure to ensure that algal biofuels replace a signficant proportion of the fossil fuels used by UK drivers.</p> <p>Mark Williamson, innovations director at the Carbon Trust, said: \"We must find a cost-effective and sustainable alternative to oil for our cars and planes if we are to deliver the deep cuts in carbon emissions necessary to tackle climate change. Algae could provide a significant part of the answer and represents a multibillion-pound opportunity.\"</p> <p>Transport accounts for one-quarter of the UK's carbon emissions and is the fastest growing sector. Finding carbon-neutral fuels will be crucial to the government meeting its target to reduce overall emissions by 80% by 2050. </p> <p>A recent review by the chairman of the Renewable Fuels Agency, Ed Gallagher, identified algae as a potential way to generate sustainable biofuels. Biofuels made from food crops have been blamed for rising food prices.</p> <p>Algae produce a range of chemicals depending on their species and the environmental conditions in which they grow. View how the process works <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/interactive/2008/jun/26/algae\">here</a>. Scientists hope to find strains that can produce oils that could be used to make fuel for cars, as a replacement for petrol and diesel. Once identified, these algae could be grown in large amounts and processed to extract the useful oils.</p> <p>John Loughhead, executive director of the UK Energy Research Council, said: \"Algae are potentially attractive means to harvest solar energy: they reproduce themselves, so there's no manufacturing cost for the solar converter, they can live in areas not useful for food or similar productive use, they don't need clean or even fresh water so don't add to global water stress, and can give oils, biomass, or even hydrogen as a product. Perhaps they'll be the stem cells of the energy world.\"</p> <p>The Carbon Trust forecasts that algae-based biofuels could replace more than 70 billion litres of fossil fuels used every year around the world in road transport and aviation by 2030, equivalent to 12% of annual global jet fuel consumption or 6% of road transport diesel. In carbon terms, this equates to an annual saving of more than 160m tonnes of CO2 globally with a market value of more than \u00a315bn.</p> <p>For the first stage of the project, the Carbon Trust will spend up to \u00a36m in a range of British companies involved in promising algae research. \"You can make algae with a very high oil content and you can make algae that grows very quickly and, at the moment, no one can do both,\" said Robert Trezona, R&amp;D director at the Carbon Trust. Other problems include the best design of mass-culture systems.</p> <p>John Benneman, a consultant on algae who has worked with the US Department of Energy and the International Energy Agency, said that it would take a multitude of approaches to fully realise the potential of algae. \"There are many more different algae species than there are higher plant species so each algae will require specific effort. Each one will have its own peculiar requirements to figure out how to make them productive, how to get the right strains, how to harvest and process them. We cannot just depend on one or two companies.\"</p> <p>The second phase of the project will start in around a year and involves scaling up the algae-growing operation. The Carbon Trust will build multi-hectare open ponds to act as laboratories for the most promising algae technologies identified in the early stages of the challenge. Due to the UK's gloomy weather, these will most likely be built abroad. </p> <p>\"If you I've got 12 months a year of warmth and sunshine, your algae farm just produces much more biomass. In a world where costs will be important, UK algae farms would have a real problem,\" said Trezona. This phase of the project could see the Carbon Trust, and interested partners from industry, investing up to \u00a320m.</p> <p>Loughhead welcomed the Carbon Trust project. \"The critical aspect is that algae convert the energy of sunlight and the efficiency with which they do that determines the economic viability of the whole approach as sunlight is unhelpfully low in energy density. Hopefully this Carbon Trust scheme will help gather information on how well that can be done now, and start the scientific development to improve it for the future.\"</p> <p>There have been major efforts in the past to develop biofuels from algae. Multimillion-dollar programmes funded by the US government in the 1980s found that high biomass yields were possible but research ended when no one found a way to make it commercially competitive with the low oil prices of that era. Work in Japan also faltered when researchers were unable to scale up the growth of algae in photobioreactors, closed vessels that provide plenty of light and conditions that could intensively grow the microorganisms. To date, no one has designed a system that has made it to market.</p> <p>But the Carbon Trust believes that interest in algae has been renewed, thanks to the recent increases in oil prices and public awareness of climate change. </p> <p>Transport minister Andrew Adonis said: \"This project demonstrates our commitment to ensuring that second generation biofuels are truly sustainable \u2014 and will further our understanding of the potential for microalgae to be refined for use in renewable transport fuel development, to help reduce carbon dioxide emissions.\"</p> <p>Several companies around the world are already involved in making fuels from algae, with one of the most prominent the San Diego-based company Sapphire Energy. Sapphire plans to use genetically modified algae to produce a chemical mixture from which it is possible to extract what it calls \"green crude\". Their idea is to refine this mixture into fuel for cars and airplanes. Investors include the UK's Wellcome Trust and the company has so far raised $100m to develop its ideas. </p> <p>Loughhead added that another potential benefit of algae is its ability to remove CO2 from the air. \"Although here they will re-emit it when used as fuels, there is the possibility that they could ultimately be used as a means of cleaning the atmosphere \u2014 if we can find a way of converting the algae to a safely storable form after they've grown.\"</p>",
  "<p>A \"traumatised\" George Osborne has been told by senior Tory colleagues that he showed poor judgment in his dealings with Peter Mandelson and Nat Rothschild and that he must show greater political maturity if he is to prosper as David Cameron's main lieutenant in government.</p> <p>One senior figure close to the highest echelons of the party said the shadow chancellor had been \"ill advised\" to brief against Mandelson on his return from the Rothschild villa in Corfu.</p> <p>\"George Osborne has not done anything wrong,\" the frontbencher said. \"But he was ill advised to leak the comments from Peter Mandelson.\"</p> <p>As a chastened Osborne took his customary seat to the right of David Cameron at yesterday's prime minister's questions, Tory MPs at all levels of the party were assessing the damage to the shadow chancellor's career by the revelations about his Corfu holiday. </p> <p>MPs agreed that he made two mistakes: to involve himself too closely in a discussion about a donation from a Russian billionaire, Oleg Deripaska; and to brief the Sunday Times that Mandelson had \"dripped poison\" about Gordon Brown into his ear.</p> <p>\"This has been a traumatic experience for George,\" one frontbencher said. \"He will be thinking very hard about this.\"</p> <p>Conservative MPs have been showing particular interest in assessing the impact on Osborne because the Deripaska affair marks the first slip up in a gilded career that has advanced rapidly since he was appointed shadow chancellor at the age of 33 in 2005. Osborne, who is the Tories' general election campaign coordinator, is Cameron's closest political ally and would be a hugely powerful chancellor with a writ running across government.</p> <p>He is widely respected among Tories as one of their finest political brains and strategists who has played a pivotal role in repositioning the party under Cameron's leadership. The Oxford history graduate, who became Cameron's campaign manager in the 2005 leadership contest after rejecting advice from Michael Howard to put his own name forward, has a razor sharp intellect and is often \"miles ahead\" even of senior members of the Cameron circle in their daily morning meetings.</p> <p>But some wonder whether the Corfu affair shows that Osborne's greatest strength - his quick, calculating, political brain - can also become his greatest weakness. Some Tories fear that he often looks for a tactical political win without thinking through the consequences, a tendency illustrated by his decision to brief against Mandelson. \"There is sometimes something of the students' union about George,\" one MP says.</p> <p>Many Tory MPs were enjoying Osborne's discomfort because they have resented the way in which such a young figure, who has risen so rapidly, makes no secret of his disdain for lesser mortals. \"George does have a swagger,\" one frontbencher said.</p> <p>One Osborne tactic which has irritated colleagues is his tendency to send out text messages to junior frontbenchers, often late in the evening, with mildly critical remarks. When the hapless MPs reply they receive no response because Osborne has switched off his phone. The following day he will joke that he meant no harm and that he was sending group texts.</p> <p>One colleague said: \"There have been too many asides from George about colleagues not needing to wait by the phone for the call summoning them to be a minister after an election win.\"</p> <p>But other colleagues were more generous to Osborne, whose typical waspish humour was on display in meetings with colleagues yesterday as he laughed off some of the more ridiculous aspects of the affair. One MP said: \"It is very clear why George is in the frame: he is central to David Cameron and Labour would love to bring him down.\"</p> <p>Another senior figure thought Osborne would emerge stronger from the affair, assuming there were no more damaging allegations. \"This has been very good for George,\" the frontbencher said. \"He is very bright, very effective, though of course he's also a little cocky. </p> <p>\"He is repected, admired, even feared in the party. But he is not really liked. This business will show him that however good you are, when the shit hits the fan you need friends.\"</p> <p>Cameron has offered his unequivocal support for Osborne but is irritated that the shadow chancellor has allowed the headlines to be dominated by Tory funding stories. </p> <p>The leader's immediate support shows the depth of trust between the two men; they have a shared political outlook, though the London-educated Osborne says that he comes from a more urban environment than the landed and Eton-educated Cameron.</p> <p>Osborne spoke openly in the Guardian last month of how he and Cameron are cut from a different cloth. \"There are differences and we had different upbringings,\" he said.</p> <p>His status as the second most powerful man in the Tory party is shown by the generous financing of his office which has allowed him to hire treasury and Bank of England officials. His supporters include Lady (Serena) Rothschild, the mother of his former friend who provided \u00a3190,000, and millionaire hedge fund managers.</p> <h2>Unanswered questions</h2> <p>\u2022 Did <strong>Andrew Feldman </strong>go to <strong>Nat Rothschild's villa </strong>in Corfu on the basis of what the Tories call a social invitation or was he drawn by the prospect of a donation from <strong>Oleg Deripaska</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Did <strong>George Osborne </strong>and Feldman discuss the donation on the billionaire's yacht?</p> <p>\u2022 Who first suggested that Deripaska could meet British political <strong>funding rules </strong>by making a donation through his British company, <strong>Leyland DAF</strong>?

  "<p>The malaise which has held <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/tottenhamhotspur\">Spurs</a> in its damp grip all season was best articulated by their misfit winger David Bentley here last night. \"It's been shocking. It's been a bit shit. It has been a bad start to the season, especially for me,\" he said. \"We have not been together, we have not known where we are running or what we have been doing. I wasn't enjoying it.\" </p> <p>The only thing prepared about Tottenham this season has been their statements from the chairman, Daniel Levy, but Bentley's comments come closer than anyone's to identifying the shambles of their league campaign, which has now reached crisis point with no wins in eight matches. </p> <p>Ledley King, Spurs' outstanding but brittle defender and so key to his side's fortunes, trained in the Stadio Friuli here last night but there is a familiar question mark against his chances of playing in tonight's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/uefa\">Uefa Cup</a> tie against <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/udinese\">Udinese</a>, who are second in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/serieafootball\">Serie A</a>.</p> <p>The decision to play or not play King will reveal more than the condition of the player's knee. It will also indicate whether the manager, Juande Ramos, considers the Uefa Cup more important than their future in the Premier League, where they are bottom of the table with two points. Spurs play at home to Bolton on Sunday before fixtures against Arsenal and Liverpool that could be decisive.</p> <p>\"We will have to wait and see,\" Ramos said last night. We will make a decision in the morning.\" Spurs have lost four and drawn one of the five games King has missed this season and Ramos is ruefully aware of the truth of his predecessor Martin Jol's observation: \"It's simple - Tottenham are twice as good when he plays.\" </p> <p>He was expected to play in the game against Stoke on Sunday but the fact that he didn't suggested that Ramos was saving him for Udinese and the manager did say last night: \"This is the most important game. What happens if we lose this game?\" The atmosphere in the squad, he said, would be even worse. But after Sunday the league position is desperate.</p> <p>Roman Pavlyuchenko and Vedran Corluka are cup-tied tonight while the injured Tom Huddlestone did not make the trip. </p> <p>News of Spurs' plight is spreading. The Udinese forward Antonio Di Natale was asked last night how many Spurs players would get into the home side's line-up he couldn't think of anybody. \"I would want to keep playing with the players that we have got,\" he said.</p> <p>Little wonder. Ramos is under fire and his lack of consistent decision making has been a factor in Spurs' problems. But he can hardly be blamed for the clumsy sacking of Jol or the appointment of the sporting director, Damien Comolli, whose position gets more fragile by the hour. If it is any consolation for Tottenham Venice, which is just up the road, has been shipping water a lot longer than they have and the place is still afloat.</p> <p>Michael Dawson, meanwhile, has denied a charge of improper conduct and requested a personal FA hearing. The Tottenham defender was charged on Tuesday and could face an increased ban. Dawson was dismissed in stoppage-time of the defeat by Stoke on Sunday and the charge relates to how he reacted when referee Lee Mason showed the red card. An FA commission will hear the case today.</p> <p>Spurs hope to give their supporters some good news by confirming the move to a new 55,000-seat stadium on the trading estate that is adjacent to White Hart Lane. Levy and his directors have identified the Wingate estate, immediately to the north of the current site, as the preferred option but progress has been held up by the global financial downturn.</p> <p>TV: Five, 6pm</p>",
  "<p>Of all the feats of misdirection that have characterised the financial crisis the stealthy but sure attempt to make footballers its poster boys seems the most pathetic. Have you noticed it? You would call it a whispering campaign, were it not for culture secretary Andy Burnham quacking loudly about football having to \"reassess its relationship with money\". </p> <p>You would call it a whispering campaign, were it not for the Daily Mail running endless paparazzi pictures of Steven Gerrard's wife in a new BMW. \"What credit crunch?\" the headline demanded tartly, while the copy was full of mawkish asides about the rest of Britain \"counting the pennies\" while Alex Curran \"indulged in a spot of retail therapy\".</p> <p>You would call it a whispering campaign, were it not for the apparent consensus that Ashley Cole was deafeningly booed less for his howler which presented Kazakhstan with a goal at Wembley the other week and more because he is seen as typifying the venal culture that now sits at odds with the straitened circumstances in which we find ourselves. </p> <p>Wondering why, on the day Alistair Darling had spent \u00a3500bn of taxpayers' money bailing out the banks, the Sun had splashed on that Afghan woman living in a big house on benefits, my colleague Peter Wilby noted that the Marxist answer would be that \"the corporate-owned press and its lick-spittle journalists are trying to direct the workers' anger away from the bourgeoisie towards members of their own class.\" \"The depressing truth,\" he countered, \"is that newspapers are giving readers what they want.\" </p> <p>With very little trouble we can extend this assessment to people's apparent desire to see high-salaried footballers taken down a peg, instead of focusing their anger on the real culprits. You hear a lot about things being \"put into perspective\" these days. One of the things that ought to have been put into perspective by the economic fiasco is just how responsible footballers really are for all the problems in society. Is it OK to place them way, way behind bankers right now?</p> <p>Footballers are the most minor villains, if they have to be villains at all. Obviously none of us could warm to Cole's emetic little memoir My Defence, whose most memorable passage involved him nearly swerving off the road in some flounce about \u00a35,000 extra a week. But conflating this with the financial meltdown is witless. Similarly does the Liverpool captain buying a new car count as rewarding failure in any serious way?</p> <p>As for Andy Burnham, it is worth reminding ourselves that Andy comes to the DCMS brief after a spell as chief secretary to the treasury, a position to which he was appointed despite having no meaningful background in finance or economics. One particularly clueless interview during the run on Northern Rock saw him labelled as completely out of his depth. He is clearly more comfortable in the relative shallows of scoring cheap points about football's relationship with money. \"The game is becoming increasingly polarised,\" Andy observed last week. \"The top clubs who build on global success are in danger of becoming detached from the communities that build them\" - much as the bankers were. Has that all changed, now we plebs own them? Not so much, it seems. </p> <p>And yet, this crisis feels slightly bigger than giving a toss about what Alex Curran is driving. Cannot the Mail stick a load of snappers outside the Lloyds chief executive's house(s)? You know the guy: he announced this week that staff would be getting bonuses whatever the government said. Let us see pictures of Lloyds board members out in their new BMWs. No doubt they would protest they are not public figures - and I would agree. They are a step beyond that - they are nationalised figures and, until they find a Sepp Blatter to gibber about their being treated like slaves, they should be required to pony up the entertainment we all need in these gloomy times. </p> <p>I propose the following, which would serve the joint purpose of administering some stick, after all those carrots, and addressing the black hole in Wembley's finances. Once a month, until they have paid back what they owe, XI bank directors should play XI bank directors at Wembley. Then instead of having to wait for Ashley Cole to make some mistake, the crowd would feel licensed from the get-go to come up with all manner of imaginative insults to rain down upon the players. It would be a shame that only one side could lose, of course, but it might remind us all that footballers are not public enemy No1.</p>",
  "<h2>Pier 'could have been saved but for alarm delay'</h2> <p>The Grand Pier at Weston-super-Mare, which was destroyed by fire in July could have been saved had the owners not cancelled a contract with an alarm company to provide a manned response to a fire alert, a fire service report said yesterday. An alarm signal was transmitted to System 2 Security at 1.35am, but Avon and Somerset fire service was not called until 6.45am. The report says a vital five hours were lost. An investigation by the pier's owners, Kerry and Michelle Michael, and their insurance company is continuing into why a 999 call was not made following the initial alarm.<br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Tributes paid to family killed in motorway crash</h2> <p>Colleagues and neighbours of a family of six who died in a crash on the M6 in Cheshire paid tribute to them yesterday. David Statham, 38, his wife, Michelle, 33, and their children, Reece, 13, Jay, nine, Mason, one, and 10-week-old Elouise, were returning home to Llandudno, north Wales, when the accident happened on Monday. Neighbour Lyn Claricas, 70, described the family as \"lovely people.\" Judith Leslie, bursar at St David's College, where Statham worked as a chef, said he \"always had a friendly smile\". A 46-year-old Portuguese HGV driver has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving.<br><strong>Helen Carter</strong></p> <h2>'No warning' before police shot De Menezes</h2> <p>A detective who held Jean Charles de Menezes down as he was shot by police yesterday told how his colleagues almost killed him. The surveillance officer, known as Ivor, told the inquest into the Brazilian's death that he feared De Menezes was about to explode a bomb. De Menezes was killed on the London underground on July 22, 2005, a day after suicide bombers struck. Giving evidence from behind a screen, Ivor said at one stage a gun appeared to be levelled at him. He did not hear any police officer shout a direct verbal warning or challenge at De Menezes before he was shot. The inquest continues.<br><strong>Vikram Dodd</strong></p> <h2>Teenager held over death of 16-year-old cadet</h2> <p>Merseyside police investigating the murder of the 16-year-old army cadet Joseph Lappin arrested a boy of the same age, from the Kirkdale area of Liverpool, yesterday on suspicion of the killing. Detectives had been looking for two boys thought to have been the ringleaders in the gang attack, which happened in Everton on Monday evening outside the Shrewsbury House youth club, which Lappin had just attended. Lappin suffered a single stab wound to the left side of his chest which pierced his heart. A second victim, aged 17, was stabbed and another suffered minor injuries in the attack.<br><strong>Helen Carter</strong></p> <h2>Witness protection urged in fighting 'honour' crime</h2> <p>Witness protection schemes should be extended to victims of \"honour\" crimes and their relatives, according to senior police officers. The first strategy for dealing with \"honour\"-based violence in England and Wales was published yesterday by the Association of Chief Police Officers following high-profile cases in which forces have failed to take allegations of violence seriously. Up to 12 people a year, mostly women, are murdered in the name of honour, according to Acpo. The strategy is intended to help rationalise different forces' approaches to such offences.<br><strong>Sandra Laville</strong></p> <h2>Tobago tourists sexually assaulted and robbed</h2> <p>Two British women were sexually assaulted and robbed on the Caribbean island of Tobago, officials said. A masked intruder carrying a knife broke into the Black Rock Dreams guesthouse, where the women were staying, an employee of the hotel told a local newspaper. He added that the incident had lasted up to an hour. A Foreign Office spokesman, urging caution for travellers, said: \"We are aware that an assault took place in Tobago and are offering consular assistance.\" The attack followed the deaths less than two weeks ago of a Swedish couple during a suspected robbery on the island.<br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Private companies to run new 'sin bins' for pupils</h2> <p>Ministers have given the go-ahead for private companies to run small schools for excluded children in ventures in which they will be allowed to make a profit. The schools secretary, Ed Balls, will today announce 12 pilot projects of replacements for pupil referral units after an admission that the so-called \"sin bins\" are failing thousands of children. They will be replaced by new dedicated units, some run by charities and others controlled by private providers. Christine Blower, acting general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: \"This is the creeping privatisation of education.\"<br><strong>Polly Curtis</strong></p> <h2>A first for Swindon as speed cameras scrapped</h2> <p>Swindon council last night became the first town in the UK to scrap speed cameras over concerns that the government is using them to raise money. The nine-strong cabinet of the Tory-run council voted unanimously in favour of withdrawing from the partnership that operates local safety cameras; councillors objected to the government receiving proceeds from fines while the council paid for the upkeep of the cameras. Peter Greenhalgh, councillor for highways, said other speed-reducing measures were being considered, including education for motorists and reduced speed limits in problem areas.<br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>MPs demand rethink on aviation emissions</h2> <p>Fifty-four Labour MPs have signed a parliamentary amendment demanding the inclusion of emissions from international aviation and shipping in Britain's greenhouse gas targets. The number of signatories is enough to overturn Gordon Brown's majority when the climate change bill comes before the Commons next Tuesday and reflects backbench concern that the government's plans do not reflect the true scale of the UK's contribution to global warming.

  "<p>Growing inequality in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/america\">US</a> cities could lead to widespread social unrest and increased mortality, says a new <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/unitednations\">United Nations</a> report on the urban environment. </p> <p>In a survey of 120 major cities, New York was found to be the ninth most unequal in the world and Atlanta, New Orleans, Washington, and Miami had similar inequality levels to those of Nairobi, Kenya Abidjan and Ivory Coast. Many were above an internationally recognised acceptable \"alert\" line used to warn governments. </p> <p>\"High levels of inequality can lead to negative social, economic and political consequences that have a destabilising effect on societies,\" said the report. \"[They] create social and political fractures that can develop into social unrest and insecurity.\"</p> <p>According to the annual State of the World's cities report from UN-Habitat, race is one of the most important factors determining levels of inequality in the US and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/canada\">Canada</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338897074\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2008/10/22/MEGACITIES_2310.gif\" alt=\"megacities\" width=\"461\" height=\"502\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>&#xa0;</p> <p>\"In western New York state nearly 40% of the black, Hispanic and mixed-race households earned less than $15,000 compared with 15% of white households. The life expectancy of African-Americans in the US is about the same as that of people living in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/china\">China</a> and some states of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/india\">India</a>, despite the fact that the US is far richer than the other two countries,\" it said.</p> <p>Disparities of wealth were measured on the \"Gini co-efficient\", an internationally recognised measure usually only applied to the wealth of countries. The higher the level, the more wealth is concentrated in the hands of fewer people. </p> <p>\"It is clear that social tension comes from inequality. The trickle down theory [that wealth starts with the rich] has not delivered. Inequality is not good for anybody,\" said Anna Tibaijuka, head of UN-Habitat, in London yesterday. </p> <p>The report found that India was becoming more unequal as a direct result of economic liberalisation and globalisation, and that the most unequal cities were in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/southafrica\">South Africa</a> and Namibia and Latin America. \"The cumulative effect of unequal distribution [of wealth] has been a deep and lasting division between rich and poor. Trade liberalisation did not bring about the expected benefits.\"</p> <p>The report suggested that Beijing was now the most egalitarian city in the world, just ahead of cities such as Jakarta in Indonesia and Dire Dawa in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/ethiopia\">Ethiopia</a>. </p> <p>In Europe, which was generally more egalitarian than other continents, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands and Slovenia were classed as the most equal countries with Greece, the UK and Spain among the least. \"Disparities are particularly significant in the cities of eastern Europe, larger Spanish cities and in the north of England,\" it said. </p> <p>It documents the seemingly unstoppable move of people away from rural to urban areas. This year it is believed that the number of people living in urban areas exceeded those in the countryside for the first time ever, but the report says there is no sign of the trend slowing. </p> <p>\"The dramatic transition between rural and urban communities is not over. Urbanisation levels will rise dramatically in the next 40 years to reach 70% by 2050,\" it predicts.</p> <p>The most dramatic urbanisation has been taking place in China, with many millions of people moving from the countryside to cities. The report says 49 new cities have been built in the past 18 years. The rapid transition to an urban society has brought great wealth but also many negative results. </p> <p>\"China has attained some of the deepest disparities in the world with urban incomes three times those in rural areas. Inequalities are growing, with disproportionate rewards for the most skilled workers ... and serious problems for the unemployed and informal workers.\"</p> <p>Urban growth rates are highest in the developing world, which absorbs an average 5 million new urban residents a month and is responsible for 95% of world urban growth. The report predicts that Asian cities will grow the most in the next 40 years and could have 63% of the world urban population by 2050.</p> <p>Tokyo is expected to remain the world's largest mega city, with 36.4m people by 2025. But Mexico City, New York, and Sao Paulo could give way in the league table to Mumbai, Delhi and Dhaka. Kinshasa and Lagos are the two African cities expected to grow the most, with each adding more than 6 million people by 2025.</p> <p>Rather than countryside to city movement, which has marked rapid population growth in the last 40 years, the UN expects more people to move from city to city. </p> <p>Capital cities in particular are attracting much more of countries' investments and are growing fast. Some are becoming home to nearly half a country's population. </p> <p>But the report also identified what it believes is the emergence of a new urban trend, with many cities now shrinking in size. The populations of 46 countries, including Germany, Italy, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/japan\">Japan</a> and most former soviet states, are expected to be smaller in 2050 than they are now, and in the past 30 years, says the report, more cities in the developed world have shrunk than grown.</p> <p>It found that 49 cities in the UK, including Liverpool and other old industrial centres in the north of England, and 100 in Russia reduced in size between 1990 and 2000, mainly because of unemployment. In the US 39 cities are smaller now than they were 10 years ago. </p> <p>The reasons for the decline of cities was mostly economic, but the report says that the environment is now an important factor. </p> <p>Air quality and pollution from mines, power plants and oil exploration have been responsible for population losses in India, Mexico and Africa, it says. \"Cities tend to struggle most with health-threatening environmental issues, such as the lack of safe water, sanitation and waste.\"</p>",
  "<p>How low could the pound go? The short answer is: quite a bit lower against the US dollar; maybe not much further against the euro.</p> <p>Sterling has been a screaming sell against the dollar since the summer, when it was defying gravity by trading close to $2.00. That was close to the top of a 25-year range, even though forecasts for growth in the UK were being slashed more aggressively than for any other G7 economy.</p> <p>It took Mervyn King's warnings about recession on Tuesday night to provoke yesterday's big sell-off, but there is no reason to believe that support will emerge at the new rate of $1.63 or so. First, sterling still stands a few cents above most economists' estimates of where purchasing power parity lies - somewhere between $1.50 and $1.60 is the usual rule of thumb.</p> <p>Second, buying dollars is once again a safe option for corporate treasurers and international investors. Troubles in eastern Europe are undermining the euro - cuts in interest rates in the eurozone could eventually be as deep as in the UK. Money managers increasingly feel they know what they're getting from the US Federal Reserve, which has already cut rates to 1.5%.</p> <p>Third, the idea is gaining ground that the US, being the first into the downturn, will be first out. Given the massive trade imbalances in the US and the level of personal debt, that script takes some believing. But in the foreign exchange game everything is relative - buying one currency implies selling another - and there's no denying that the US's relative position has improved as the rest of the world's, including Asia's, has deteriorated.</p> <p>Fourth, King sounds as if he wants sterling to fall. At the end of his speech, he highlighted how reliant British banks had become in recent years on flows of capital from overseas. If other forms of external finance don't fill the gap, adjustments in the trade deficit and exchange rate \"will need to be larger and faster than would otherwise have occurred\", he concluded.</p> <p>We certainly saw a fast adjustment yesterday. Is it large enough? Probably not, for the simple reason that we have yet to see many of the beneficial effects of a falling currency, such as a boost to exports. </p> <p>The manufacturing sector has been contracting for a couple of quarters. When that position starts to turn around, it will be time to start thinking about sterling stabilising against the dollar.</p> <p>The position against the euro, though, looks very different. The German finance minister, Peer Steinbr\u00fcck, was trying to maintain as recently as last month that the credit crunch was a US phenomenon. The same thinking infected the European Central Bank, which actually raised interest rates once this year to combat inflation. The reality of recession has dawned late in the eurozone. Now its bankers and finance ministers face the difficult job of fighting a downturn without fiscal union. They will soon be sounding as gloomy as King and Gordon Brown. </p> <p><strong>No puff from Duddy</strong></p> <p>A falling currency is not much help to importers, however, as Terry Duddy, chief executive of Home Retail Group, pointed out. General merchandisers, such as his Argos and Homebase chains, buy half their goods from the far east. A combination of rising costs and weakening demand at home is vicious. Duddy calls the outlook \"depressing\".</p> <p>The research group Verdict goes further, predicting the \"toughest trading environment ever\" this Christmas. It is surely guilty of hyperbole - there were some pretty bleak Christmases as recently as the 1980s - but we get the picture. </p> <p>Indeed, the most telling news is that retailers as diverse as Sainsbury's and Debenhams are already reporting that sales of Christmas-related goods - everything from Christmas puddings to perfume - are well above normal levels because shoppers are trying to spread out the cost of Christmas by buying early.</p> <p>Yet this factor is impossible to detect in current sales numbers. Like-for-like sales at Argos, which relies heavily on pre-Christmas trading, are running 9% below last year's levels. So underlying demand on the high street may be even worse than recent snapshots suggest.</p> <p>Has the stockmarket priced in all this pessimism? Frankly, you doubt it. There has been plenty of talk about buying bombed-out consumer stocks for their recovery potential. It looks premature. Duddy said that 2009 is \"likely to be at least as challenging as 2008\". The big increases in unemployment are yet to come. And lower interest rates take months to filter into shoppers' purses.</p> <p>Retailers need some old-fashioned wage inflation. As yet, there's no sign of it. The retail sector still looks to be a sell.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:nils.pratley@theguardian.com\">nils.pratley@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Ian McGeechan yesterday defended the decision to have the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/lionstour2009\">Lions</a> management team for South Africa next summer largely made up of past and present personnel of a club soundly beaten in this city in the Heineken Cup last weekend.</p> <p>Six of the seven major management figures for the tour played some part in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/londonwasps\">Wasps'</a> success before the current season. McGeechan, the head coach, is Wasps' director of rugby and it was announced here yesterday that he will be accompanied by five of the Wales management team - Warren Gatland (forwards), Shaun Edwards (defence), Rob Howley (attack), Craig White (conditioning) and Rhys Long (analysis) - who have worked with the Guinness Premiership champions. The team doctor, James Robson, is the exception. </p> <p>\"We will have minimum preparation time and it is vitally important that we come together quickly,\" said McGeechan. \"We know and trust each other. If someone says it is Club Wasps, I would ask if that was a bad thing. It will bring us uniformity of thinking, trust and honesty. There will be no hiding in corners or whispering. Everything will be out in the open.\"</p> <p>McGeechan, a former Scotland coach, said: \"I will be making sure that we have a really good look at players in Scotland and Ireland.\" Gatland, in charge of Ireland between 1998 and 2001, warned that any Wales players who thought their prospects of making the tour had increased would be in for a shock. \"I am conscious of what happened in 2001,\" he said, referring to the tour led by the then Wales coach, Graham Henry, who took more Welsh players than form merited to Australia and suffered a backlash when most missed out on the Tests. \"I was in charge of Ireland then and we were disappointed at the low number of our players who were chosen. We used it as motivation when we played Wales that October, and Welsh players are going to have to work a bit harder than everyone else to get selected. They will certainly not get in because of their nationality.\"</p> <p>Gatland, the second New Zealander, after Henry, to coach the Lions, had predicted a 3-0 defeat in his native country in 2005. \"The Lions were too unwieldy then,\" he said. \"We are taking a smaller management team and no more than 36 players. We have to look at what makes Munster so successful: it is not always about having the best players but being the best team.\"</p> <p>McGeechan is being paid by the Lions this season but is continuing to work with Wasps, where Edwards is head coach. \"We will shortly announce an addition to the Wasps coaching team,\" he said, adding that it would not be Jake White, the former South Africa coach who has been linked with a consultancy role with Wasps and the Lions, or the club's former captain, Lawrence Dallaglio. \"I hope to be meeting up with Jake next month, but he will not be involved with the Lions.</p> <p>\"The Lions are the only tourists in rugby now. It is a step up from anything players have faced in their careers: we face seven Six Nations matches and three World Cup finals in South Africa and we have little time in which to prepare. That is why chemistry counts for as much as talent in creating the right environment.\"</p> <p>An initial squad of between 60 and 65 players will be whittled down to 35 or 36 a month after the Six Nations. \"We will probably know 25 players fairly early on,\" said McGeechan, \"but it is the other 10 or 11 I believe will make the difference. It may be not all are starters for their countries.\"</p> <p>The tour manager, Gerald Davies, said talks would soon begin over the release of players, that extra security would be hired and that steps would be taken to avoid a repeat of England's trip to New Zealand last June, when players took a woman back to their hotel. \"We will look at various aspects but my hope is that players have an enjoyable time,\" said the former Wales and Lions wing. \"You do not have to be miserable and sullen to be winners.\"</p> <p>Chris Jack, Saracens' former All Black lock, is out until the end of the year after damaging knee ligaments last weekend.

  "<p>In uncertain times such as these, it ought to be reassuring to turn to British successes. The UK video games industry \u2013 or at least its development, as opposed to the publishing side \u2013 is a rare example of Britain punching above its weight. At least, that's the popular perception. Speak to any independent British games developer and you will find a considerably more apocalyptic prognosis. Recently, the situation has deteriorated so badly that a coalition of British development studios, backed by developers' trade body <a href=\"http://www.tiga.org/\">Tiga</a> and <a href=\"http://www.elspa.com/\">ELSPA</a>, the publishers' body, has embarked on a campaign to lobby the government, entitled \"Games Up?\".</p> <p>Games Up? seeks two things: tax breaks for UK developers in line with those enjoyed by the film industry, and institutional change in universities, designed to re-establish a flow of graduates with skills that are relevant to the game development process. But hang on: according to Games Up?, games made in the UK between 2006 and 2008 alone are on track to generate global revenues of \u00a34bn, and the global games market is worth \u00a318bn and growing at 9% per annum. The credit crunch isn't even an undue worry: consumers are known to turn to games in difficult times, as they offer protracted entertainment for a smallish outlay. So why are UK developers looking to the government for help?</p> <p><strong>Seductive benefits</strong></p> <p>The most pressing problem is that the UK development scene has slipped down the global pecking order since several other countries decided to seduce games companies with tax breaks. Ian Livingstone, creative director and head of acquisitions at Eidos, one of the few remaining British games publishers \u2013 and not a man ordinarily given to doom-mongering \u2013 explains: \"We've recently slipped from third to fourth in world development behind Canada. We're now the most expensive country in the world in which to develop. Other countries \u2013 not just Canada, but two states in the US, Scandinavian countries, France, Singapore, Korea and others \u2013 offer salary subsidies. Canada saw games as a clear opportunity to invest in the future, as traditional manufacturing was disappearing, and made a conscious decision to invest in games. They don't see it as a handout but as an investment. They have actually given out, in salary subsidies, 37.5% to every employee in games companies, and up to 40% R&amp;D tax-credit.</p> <p>\"Over 10 years, they have invested C$500m (\u00a3244m). But that has actually generated $1.5bn of inward investment from companies like EA, Ubisoft, and Eidos. It's paying off, because they have a great infrastructure there: they've got great universities providing skilled students, and they are generally pro-games. The difference between there and here is that our government clearly sees any state support as a handout, not an investment. It seems to me the UK government would rather see our great industry go into decline than help it maintain its prominent position in the world, and that is madness.\"</p> <p>Livingstone paints a bleak picture of the future of UK games development. \"In the past six years, half of the independent UK development studios have already closed or been bought by foreign publishers who see more value in our studios and intellectual property than we do ourselves. We'll end up being a work-for-hire nation. The inherent intellectual property that is created at those studios will be foreign-owned, and they can move that IP to be produced wherever they want in the world, if it suits them.\"</p> <p>Richard Wilson, chief executive of Tiga, is the spokesman for the Games Up? campaign. He has been meeting civil servants from the departments for Culture Media and Sport, Innovation, Universities and Skills, Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, Children, Schools and Families and the Treasury, among others. He doesn't, however, sound enormously optimistic that the government will heed his call for \"20% production tax credit, like that approved by the EU and already found in France\". Not to mention that enjoyed for many years by the British film industry.</p> <p>He adds that \"the government understands that UK games developers are not competing on a level playing field\" but is \"reluctant to introduce tax breaks for games production unless it can be shown that there is an issue of market failure or that there are strong cultural reasons for supporting UK games developers\".</p> <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly given the economic circumstances, the various government departments proved unreceptive to inquiries; the Department of Culture, Media and Sport was particularly dismissive. The Treasury did manage to produce a stultifyingly generic response although, promisingly, it says: \"Following approval of a cultural tax relief for games in France, the government is now working with the UK gaming industry to collect and review the evidence for introducing such a credit in the UK.\"</p> <p><strong>Battle for breaks</strong></p> <p>Don Foster, Liberal Democrat spokesman on culture and media, points out that the games industry is competing with others for tax breaks, notably fashion and tourism. He also believes the games industry suffers from an unjustifiably poor image: \"I hardly play any games \u2013 I'm not from that generation \u2013 but because of my job, I had to research the industry. The vast majority of my parliamentary colleagues are always wanting to ban the latest game, but they don't know the details of the industry. Few people in this country realise how important it is to the UK economy.\" Livingstone agrees: \"We're still seen as the red-headed stepchild of the creative industries, one notch up from pornography in the eyes of most of the establishment. They forget that half of the world and half of the UK's population play games. Games help define who we are as human beings \u2013 they are as important, culturally and socially, as music and films.\"</p> <p>There's another problem, though, which Foster highlights: a shortage of university graduates with the requisite skills. Which brings us to the second prong of the Games Up? campaign. There are 81 videogames courses on offer at UK universities, but only four are accredited by <a href=\"http://www.skillset.org/\">Skillset</a> and therefore taken seriously by the games industry. Livingstone says: \"These universities are churning out people who know a bit about games design and the history of games, but what we need are computer programmers, artists and animators: people with real skills who can start work tomorrow. It's better for us to go to somewhere like Imperial College and employ someone who has just done a computer science degree and knows how to program in C++.\"</p> <p>This problem ought to be easy to solve collectively, Livingstone says: \"The government, industry and education establishments have to come together to find a way to move forward.\" But Wilson says the government seems to have difficulty grasping the nature of the skills needed.</p> <p><strong>Bad law?</strong></p> <p>Jon Hare, director of development at Ukrainian developer Nikitova (and the co-founder of legendary UK developer Sensible Software) says that legislation of a decade ago which says developers must take contractors on as full-time staff after a year, or stop using them, has been economically damaging. Previously, such contractors would be paid a fixed amount for their work on the project, whether it overran or not, which allowed small developers to control their costs. Hare argues that tax breaks would merely offset extra costs which the government has introduced by that legislation.</p> <p>The Games Up? campaign may not be perfect, but, says Foster, it needs to make its case \"robustly\". But given how beleaguered the government is by the ongoing financial and banking crisis, Livingstone is pessimistic: \"The perception is 'why do we need it, as clearly we're doing well?' But do you put a new roof on your house when it's raining? Surely you should do it when it's sunny?\"</p>",
  "<p>Along the Fulham Broadway touts pitched for scraps and spares only to be met with shrugs and blank faces. The stench of vinegary ketchup hung in the air. The atmosphere cackled with chants that went back and forth and back again. In short we had something at Stamford Bridge tonight that you rarely get in Champions League matches in October: a properly feisty atmosphere. Sadly the game never lived up to it.</p> <p>For the most part Chelsea plodded and probed, while Roma stuck 10 behind the ball. Having haemorrhaged four goals against Inter at the weekend, it was perhaps unsurprising that they wanted to stop the bleeding. However, Chelsea made it too easy for them. They rarely pushed their full-backs on or forced Doni into anything other than pantomime saves. But 13 minutes from time John Terry \u2013 aided by Juliano Beletti's crafty block on Philippe Mexes \u2013 headed home Frank Lampard's corner to give Chelsea the goal their pressure probably deserved. Neutrals, however, were mostly left looking for vignettes; good performances from the leading actors in a humdrum film.</p> <p>For the first half, at least, Francesco Totti \u2013 perhaps football's ultimate Marmite test \u2013 caught this observer's eye. You might say that he cheats, he spits, he tumbles at the slightest opportunity and he can choke in the big games. And you might well have a point. But having watched him in the flesh nearly a dozen or so times, I'm a believer. His goals record, better than one every other game, is impressive enough. But what really catches the eye is his movement off the ball: how often he drops and drifts to find space, presents himself, and then \u2013 with one touch \u2013 finds a team-mate. With a moment of genius he created Roma's only real chance of the game, turning his marker, before nutmegging Mikel John Obi and rolling it to Matteo Brighi, whose shot was deflected wide.</p> <p>But while Roma sat back, Chelsea weren't in any hurry to force the issue. It was a mystery that Jose Bosingwa didn't charge down the flanks more often, or that Nicolas Anelka looked even more isolated and forlorn than usual. However, Mikel John Obi, who now gives the ball away far less than he used to certainly impressed, along with Frank Lampard, as always better in the blue of Chelsea than the red and white of England.</p> <p>But my abiding memory is of those forlorn-looking touts without a ticket to sell. The global economy has been given the kiss of life so many times in recent weeks, that it sometimes feels that we are all blind men on top of a rollercoaster: watching, waiting, expecting an almighty plunge into the abyss. There was no sense of that tonight at Stamford Bridge as the richest club in world football closed in on a place in the knockout stages.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/homeretailgroup\">Home Retail Group</a>, which controls DIY chain Homebase and the Argos catalogue shops, has crashed into the red and seen sales plunge in recent weeks.</p> <p>The retailer slumped to a first-half loss of \u00a3437m after writing down more than \u00a3500,000 from the value of its Homebase chain. The write-down, which had been flagged, is an admission that HRG paid too much for the underperforming retailer when it bought the business from private equity group Permira for \u00a3900m in 2002.</p> <p>Even without the write-down, profits for the six months to end of August were well down, falling 22% to \u00a3106m, with a 14% decline at Argos and a 37% profits slump at Homebase.</p> <p>The chief executive, Terry Duddy, warned trading conditions had \"worsened in recent weeks\". </p> <p>Like-for-like sales at Argos and Homebase were down about 9% on 2007 levels. Duddy said Christmas trading was crucial, warning that if there was no improvement, profits would be at the bottom of City expectations, at about \u00a3327m, compared with \u00a3426m last year.</p> <p>Duddy said: \"We have had like-for-like sales at negative levels in Argos that we have never seen before.\"</p> <p>The outlook for retailers, he said, was \"depressing\" and planning ahead was particularly difficult because \"we have never had a period where there has been so much lack of clarity\".</p> <p>The retailer is clamping down on costs. New stores have been put on hold to reduce capital expenditure and the hours worked by staff in stores has been cut by 20%. </p> <p>\"Will I say there won't be any job losses going forward? That's not possible,\" said Duddy.</p> <p>The dividend payout to shareholders, however, has been maintained.</p> <p>Duddy said the recent decline at Argos proved all income groups were being hit: \"About 70% of UK households have shopped with us in the last 12 months and are they being hit hard? Yes they are.</p> <p>\"People have been saying 'what has happened to my savings?' and 'what has happened to my pension?'. The next thing is going to be 'what is going to happen to my job?'. So it is not surprising there's a certain lack of confidence.\"</p> <p>HRG said it would be harder to keep prices down on general merchandise \u2013 goods that are neither food nor clothing. Half of all general merchandise sold in the UK is made in China and the Far East and Duddy said: \"We are not going to be able to buy currency cheaper, we are not going to get freight costs cheaper or source the product any cheaper\". </p> <p>His gloomy outlook came as market research group Verdict said retailers were facing \"the toughest trading environment ever\".</p> <p>Verdict is predicting consumer spending growth of just 2% in the last three months of this year \u2013 compared with growth of 3.1% last year. The expected 2% rise will be almost entirely due to inflation in food prices. </p> <p>Verdict director Neil Saunders said sales and margins would take a hit and warned retailers that to be successful they would have to \"work an awful lot harder than they have done\".</p> <p>On Tuesday, Debenhams slashed its dividend payout to save cash and said recent sales were down 4% on last year. </p> <p>Other new data showed a rapid slowdown in online spending, which had been continuing to grow rapidly despite the downturn. The IMRG Capgemini index showed internet spending up about 15% in September, compared with the 73% year-on-year growth recorded in September 2007.</p> <p>HRG shares closed up 2.75p at 196.75p. A year ago they were changing hands at 436p.</p> <p>Analyst David Jeary at Investec still rates the shares a buy. \"As the latest trading update shows, the group is not immune from pressures of consumer demand, but we believe its relative performance will be superior to other bigger ticket retailers,\" he said.</p> <p>Sam Hart at broker Charles Stanley is urging investors to reduce their holdings. \"The shares appear very cheap, but a further material decline in earnings is forecast for 2009/10 and risk remains on the downside,\" he said. \"The risk of a dividend cut also appears to be increasing.\"</p>",
  "<p>President Bush and fellow world leaders will attempt to thrash out a united response to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">the global financial crisis</a> next month when Washington hosts an emergency summit.</p> <p>The meeting on November 15 will discuss the underlying causes of the downturn, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/globaleconomy\">the global response</a> and the principles that will underpin any reforms, the White House said today. Leaders from the group of leading economies - including Brazil, China and India as well as the G7 nations such as the UK and Japan- will attend the meeting, which will also seek input from the winner of the US presidential election.</p> <p>However, the White House acknowledged that the first meeting was unlikely to produce a series of concrete proposals for tackling the consequences of the credit crunch. </p> <p>Although the world's biggest economies have followed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/banking\">Gordon Brown's lead in recapitalising their leading banks</a>, leaders have expressed divergent views on what future shape global finance should take. Bush has warned that any coordinated international action should preserve free markets but his French counterpart, Nicolas Sarkozy, declared last month that the \"all powerful market that always knows best is dead\".</p> <p>Dana Perino, a White House spokesman, said she did not expect the summit to present firm decisions on new policy or regulation. The task of putting \"meat on the bones\" after the meeting will be up to financial experts in the world leaders' respective countries, Perino added. \"A lot of work will have to be done at the task force level, the working group level,\" she said. Those working groups will then draft recommendations for consideration at further summits.</p> <p>Barack Obama, favourite to win the presidential election that takes place 11 days before the summit, welcomed the announcement by the Bush administration that it was making one last push to stabilise the global economy before the new White House incumbent takes office on January 20. </p> <p>\"I am happy today that the White House announced a summit that provides an opportunity to advance the kind of cooperation I called for last month. America must lead and other nations must be part of the solution too,\" said Obama.</p>",
  "<p>Gazprom has produced record quarterly figures on the back of a 72% increase in the value of exports to Europe, but the heavily indebted Russian group warned the credit crunch could hit its cashflow.</p> <p>The world's largest <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/gas\">gas</a> producer earned $18.5bn (\u00a311.4bn) from European sales in the first quarter, triggering more harsh criticism in the west about its decision to establish a gas cartel with Iran and Qatar that could drive up prices further.</p> <p>Domestic sales at Gazprom grew by only 2% and are now worth less than half its European business, while sales to former members of the Soviet Union slumped by 20%. </p> <p>Profits rose by 30% to more than $10bn but the company, which has a monopoly on exports from Russia and supplies a quarter of Europe's gas, admitted the global liquidity squeeze would make life harder.</p> <p>\"Such circumstances could affect the ability of the group to obtain new borrowings and refinance its existing borrowings at terms and conditions similar to those applied to earlier transactions,\" Gazprom said in a statement. </p> <p>\"Deteriorating operating conditions for borrowers may also have an impact on management's cashflow forecasts and assessment of the impairment of financial and non-financial assets.\" </p> <p>Gazprom's chief executive, Alexei Miller, said earlier this month he saw no short-term risks from the global financial crisis as his company was enjoying record gas prices and had no urgent need to borrow. Analysts said the company's debts of $40bn were still relatively small, given the profits generated and the scale of its business.</p> <p>But Artyom Konchin, an analyst at Aton Capital in Moscow, said Gazprom's share price had slumped 70% to give the group a value of $100bn, partly because it had failed to convince investors that the scale of investments it wanted to make could be justified at a time when demand may be hit by global economic slowdown. </p> <p>\"Minority investors in particular want to know where the value is coming from,\" Konchin said.</p> <p>Gazprom announced on Monday it was establishing a \"big gas troika\" with Iran and Qatar, described by the Iranian oil minister, Gholamhossein Nozari, as a \"gas Opec\".</p> <p>David Clark, a former special adviser to the Foreign Office and a chairman of the UK-based Russia Foundation, said he was alarmed by the move. \"It is a clear attempt by Russia and other countries to increase their leverage and use energy as a geopolitical weapon. It is time the European Union ensured that Russia was bound by a rules-based relationship that it had signed up to with the energy charter treaty.\" </p> <p>Clark said it was ominous that the three countries involved in the potential cartel specifically talked about liquefied natural gas (LNG). \"They clearly realise that LNG offers gas-importing countries different supply options and is an area they want to control,\" he said.</p> <p>The European commission said it would expect to be notified of any move to create such an arrangement, which could prompt the EU to revise its energy policy. </p> <p>\"In principle, the commission is against cartels for the sale and marketing of products, and hydrocarbons are no exception to that,\" said the commission's energy spokesman, Ferr\u00e1n Tarradellas Espuny. \"We believe the best conditions for the sale of a product such as gas are a free and transparent market.\" </p> <p>Two of Europe's biggest gas distributors, GDF Suez and E.ON, said the troika could be useful. </p> <p>\"We have the feeling that the forum project is not necessarily a cartel \u2014 if it was we would condemn it \u2014 but that it is a place for dialogue and we would be prepared to regard it favourably,\" said G\u00e9rard Mestrallet, the chief executive of GDF Suez, France's biggest gas utility. </p> <p>Bernhard Reutersberg, the chairman of E.ON Ruhr gas, said he was not \"really\" concerned as his company was shielded by long-term supply contracts.</p>",

At 6.30pm BST the Dow was down 412 points at 8621 - a decline of 4.5%.</p> <p>The pound began tumbling last night as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/22/mervyn-king-recession-economy\">Bank of England governor told business leaders in Leeds that the economy is shrinking</a> and hinted at fresh interest rate cuts. The prime minister compounded his comments this afternoon by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/22/gordonbrown-economy\">admitting that the global credit crisis will probably push Britain into a recession</a>.</p> <p>By 5pm BST sterling had fallen by more than seven cents to $1.6177, a drop of more than 4%, as traders reported frantic selling as investors rushed to cut their losses by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/currencies\">selling the UK currency</a>.</p> <p>Sterling also fell against the euro, slipping to \u20ac1.2761 this afternoon. The euro itself fell sharply against other currencies, hitting a four-and-a-half-year low against the yen, and its lowest value against the dollar since November 2006. </p> <p>In the City, the FTSE 100 shed more than 100 points in early trading and it closed down 188 points at 4040, a 4.5% decline. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2008/oct/22/mining-bhpbilliton\">Mining firms</a>, which will suffer badly from a global downturn, dominated the list of the top fallers.</p> <p>Traders said the bad news emanating from the US was also depressing stocks across the Atlantic. \"We have had a raft of poor earnings figures in the US and the fear continues to accelerate,\" said Howard Wheeldon, senior strategist at BGC Partners. Ewen Stewart, equity strategist at Investec, said: \"The truth is dawning that we are in a pretty long and difficult economic period and there's a realisation that earnings forecasts ... remain too high, and that is driving equity valuations low.\" Blake Jorgensen, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/22/apple-yahoo-technology-profit\">Yahoo's chief financial officer</a>, said on Tuesday that the US economy was entering \"what is very clearly a recession mode.\"</p> <p>The pound had already been hit yesterday by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/22/manufacturing-creditcrunch\">unexpectedly gloomy manufacturing data showing that confidence has collapsed,</a> and King's comments appear to have added to concern over quite how weak the British economy now is.</p> <p>Describing the banking system turmoil of recent weeks as \"extraordinary, almost unimaginable,\" he said the financial system had come closer to collapse two weeks ago than at any time in the past 90 years.</p> <p>\"The combination of a squeeze on real take-home pay and a decline in the availability of credit poses the risk of a sharp and prolonged slowdown in domestic demand. Indeed, it now seems likely that the UK economy is entering a recession,\" King said.</p> <p>\"It is surely probable that the drama of the banking crisis, which is unprecedented in the lifetime of almost all of us, will damage business and consumer confidence more generally.\"</p> <p>His fears were confirmed yesterday as the CBI reported that confidence among British manufacturers had tumbled to its lowest since July 1980, with output and orders also collapsing.</p> <p>The prime minister also conceded for the first time that a recession is likely in the UK. Brown told MPs: \"Having taken action on the banking system, we must now take action on the global financial recession.\" He said this would probably result in \"recession in America, France, Italy, Germany, Japan and - because no country can insulate itself from it - Britain too\".</p> <p>The thinktank the National Institute for Economic and Social Research said today that Britain entered a recession in the third quarter of the year and warns the slump will probably last for a year or more, making it every bit as painful as the recessions of the early 1990s or early 1980s.</p> <p>City commentator David Buik said that <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/speeches/2008/index.htm\">King's speech</a> has \"put sterling to the sword for the time being\".</p> <p>The Bank of England cut the cost of borrowing by half a point to 4.5% earlier this month, as part of coordinated global action, and King hinted that rates may come down again soon.</p> <p>\"During the past month, the balance of risks to inflation in the medium-term shifted decisively to the downside,\" he said.</p> <p>CMC Markets analyst James Hughes said that the possibility of interest rate cuts across Europe have made the greenback more attractive - after months in which traders bet against the dollar.</p> <p>\"Investors continue to flock to the dollar as speculation mounts that central banks elsewhere will continue with aggressive rate cuts in an attempt to stimulate growth in the near term,\" said Hughes.</p> <p>Official data out on Friday will almost certainly show that the economy contracted in the July to September period, having not grown at all in the second quarter. A \"technical\" recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction, which experts say is the least Britain can expect this time round.</p>",
  "<p>Satellite broadcaster <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/britishskybroadcastinggroup\">BSkyB</a></strong> has fallen sharply on concerns that hard-hit consumers might start cancelling their pay-TV contracts. The impetus for this seems to be a survey of 1,022 people conducted by market research group Continental Research, which found 10% planned to end their subscriptions.</p> <p>Analysts at Kaupthing said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"[The survey showed] 15% of the group had indicated they had chosen Freeview due to cash concerns, 13% indicated they were planning to get Freeview for the same reason and 6% said they had ditched plans to get pay-TV. Clearly this is ugly stuff if this turns out to be the case and surely sentiment will worsen as consumers come under pressure on income. It is worth noting that this will be the first recession that Sky will have experienced operating with the level of population penetration they have secured in recent years.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The news sent BSkyB shares 45.5p lower to 356.5p. But Daniel Kerven at UBS was less concerned:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Without being able to compare [the Continental survey] against a previous study, it is difficult to draw any conclusion from this. Sky already has churn of around 10% and, in previous market research surveys undertaken by UBS in 2005 and 2007, we also found that around 10% of pay customers were very likely to cancel with a further 15% somewhat likely to cancel.</p> <p>\"While the consumer space is likely to remain difficult near-term, we believe Sky will continue to outperform its consumer peers.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The Sky fall was typical of the overall mood of the market, however. The pronouncement by the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/bankofenglandgovernor\">Bank of England governor</a>, Mervyn King, that the UK was entering a recession set the tone, and poor results from banking group Wachovia and Boeing showed the signs of the downturn in the US. </p> <p>Elsewhere, Hungary hiked up interest rates to protect its currency, while Argentina formulated plans to nationalise its private pension industry.</p> <p>The global gloom left the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> down 188.84 points at 4040.89, with Wall Street off about 320 points by the time London closed.</p> <p>Miners were among the main UK fallers, as <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/bankofenglandgovernor\">BHP Billiton</a></strong> followed comments from its bid target <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/riotinto\">Rio Tinto</a> </strong>by pointing to a Chinese slowdown. </p> <p>Fears of falling demand, alongside a rise in the dollar, left metal prices lower, with copper falling 7% to its lowest level since November 2005. So <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/kazakhmys\">Kazakhmys</a></strong> closed down 47.25p at 257.75p, <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/vedantaresources\">Vedanta Resources</a></strong> fell 93.5p to 619.5p, while <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/xstrata\">Xstrata</a></strong> lost 148p to 923p as Brazil's Vale denied suggestions it was considering taking a major stake in the business. </p> <p>As for Rio, it lost 171p to \u00a323.89 despite earlier suggestions BHP might sweeten its bid with a cash element and talk that the European Commission was close to ruling on the bid. BHP dropped 87p to 880p.</p> <p>Banks were also unwanted, with <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/royalbankofscotlandgroup\">Royal Bank of Scotland</a> </strong>down 11p to 68.3p after analysts at KBW slashed earnings forecasts by 65% for next year.</p> <p><strong>Wood Group</strong>, the oil services business, slid 18p to 218.5p as Deutsche Bank moved from hold to sell and halved its price target from 430p to 215p. The company was also hit by a continuing decline in the crude price, down 5% to below $66 a barrel as US stocks fell by more than expected and despite expectations that Opec will cut production this week.</p> <p>But <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/britishairways\">British Airways</a></strong> benefited from the fall in oil, and also from talk that Cathay Pacific was planning a bid for the UK airline. Some traders were sceptical, and BA came off its best levels to close 6.1p higher at 148p.</p> <p>Also on the way up was pharmaceuticals group <strong>GlaxoSmithkline</strong>, 15p higher at \u00a311.43 after better than expected results. <strong>AstraZeneca</strong> also benefited, up 35p at \u00a323.30.</p> <p>A sector minnow, <strong>Minster Pharmaceuticals</strong>, jumped 5p to 11.25p after a positive result from phase two trials of its migraine treatment.</p> <p>Gaming systems group <strong>Inspired Gaming</strong> slipped from 0.07p to 3.38p. The company's shares have fallen sharply in recent weeks caused by an overhang of stock owned by Stodir, the Icelandic investment company (formerly FL Group) which recently filed for administration.

  "<p>With the world economy in tatters, many of us will soon find ourselves unemployed \u2013 as many as two million in the UK by Christmas, we're told. As we all tighten our belts for the long, cold winter, there's never been a better time to embrace <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/opensource\">free and open source software</a> (FOSS). This is software that you're allowed to freely copy, modify and improve, so long as you share your improvements with others. </p> <p>Some of the world's best, most powerful software is built on this model, including the best server operating system (GNU/Linux), the best browser (Firefox), and a host of office, graphics, video, audio, and productivity software. Some of it is built by individual hobbyists or communities of hobbyists and some contributions are paid for by corporations.</p> <p>Using FOSS is great in the best of times \u2013 I'm typing this on my third GNU/Linux laptop, a tiny ThinkPad that does everything I need it to, and plenty that my old, proprietary Powerbook couldn't. But in a down economy, FOSS is an even smarter choice, for a variety of reasons:</p> <p>* Cost: It's free. Go to <a href=\"http://www.ubuntu.com/\">Ubuntu.com</a> and download a totally free CD that'll install GNU/Linux on practically any hardware you can find. Use the built-in \"Add/Remove Software\" service to choose from tens of thousands of programs, all free as well.</p> <p>* Longevity: That old computer that won't run the latest and greatest proprietary operating system <em>will</em> run GNU/Linux. The older your computer is, the longer the world's free software hackers have had to figure out how to make it dance to their tune. This also goes for iPods, which can be revitalised with free, powerful, alternative operating systems like RockBox, a package that does plenty that Apple left out, like high-quality digital recording. </p> <p>Likewise, your old wireless routers can be turned into super-powerful network appliances with the free, NU/Linux-based WRT operating system. Plenty of sealed-in, \"non-modifiable\" devices from PSPs to cable boxes have alternative FOSS<br>operating systems that can make them do amazing things.</p> <p>* Versatility: Any technology \"appliance\" that you can imagine can be cooked up from a used PC and a free copy of GNU/Linux, from a box under the telly that stores all your ripped DVDs and CDs, and plays every old video game ever conceived, to a sweet little network-aware photo-frame that keeps your less technical relatives up to date on your family photos. Your imagination is the limit.</p> <p>* Support: The global community of GNU/Linux users is engaged in a continuous, friendly, helpful discussion about how to get the most out of its tools. I've gotten fast, helpful, detailed tech support at every hour of the day or night, from users all over the world (and sometimes even from the original authors of the software). All free, of course.</p> <p>* User-centered: Proprietary software design often has more to do with some company's business model than your convenience \u2013 think of all the money Microsoft has spent to keep competitors from writing software that can read your own documents and spreadsheets, or all Apple's shenanigans in the name of controlling the way you use your music. Free software is<br>free from this sort of hassle: plug your iPod into a GNU/Linux machine and you can drag-and-drop music off and onto it, at will.</p> <p>FOSS data formats are fully documented and can be read or written by anyone who wants to make a competing product, so you never have to fear getting stuck with a bunch of critical documents stuck in an orphaned file format.</p> <p>* Privacy: FOSS computers are far less likely to leak your personal information to hackers. What's more, nothing can touch FOSS when it comes to privacy-enhancing tools, from whole-disk encryption to email scrambling, so even if your files leak, they're still unreadable. Take that, identity thieves!</p> <p>Economic downtimes have historically been hobbyist boomtimes, as families turn to their own resourcefulness to stay entertained and pinch pennies. Getting up to speed on FOSS will provide you and your kids with a bottomless pool of free, community-oriented, creative resources with which to stretch your IT budget, learn practical skills and explore your creative side.</p>",

Even as the global financial crisis melts our pension funds and employment prospects like a blowtorch, it's not the end of the world. Spare a thought though for timid trainspotter Tim, hero of this delightful, deadpan Aussie sci-fi comedy, who stumbles into the apocalyptic cult-next-door during a powercut. To escape the imminent cataclysm they need a live sacrifice, and if they can't find a willing virgin, an unwilling infidel in pyjamas will do. Will Tim be their ticket off this doomed world to the Threbelian Galaxy?

In this crisp and catchy second instalment of his bird blitzkrieg, the worldwide Legions team up to battle an alien invasion of owls, wielding their secret weapon: the unstoppably infectious \"Abap-Boo\u2013Pudup \u2013 Boop-Poo\" chorus from Cloud Cuckoo Land by The Real Tuesday Weld. Enjoy how restlessly inventive Budovsky's retro woodcut graphics are, sending your gaze scuttling across the screen. Then pair this with a look at animator Stephen Irwin's accomplished and darkly disturbing The Black Dog's Progress, another monochrome oddity that makes your eyes work overtime. Black Dog's pen-scratched story is told ingeniously in looped scenes on simultaneous flipbook animations that track the horrors of his life on the streets, until the scribbled screen is humming with menace. Visually and emotionally unsettling, it's a highly original piece (with a nod to Hogarth) that is strictly adult fare.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.ifc.com/video/Web-Series/Young-American-Bodies/1529447711\">Young American Bodies: Episode One</a></h2> <p>Despite being the brainchild of Joe \"Hannah Takes The Stairs\" Swanberg, this hugely popular angst-and-sex indie soap opera is as much soft-core as mumblecore, with plenty of full-frontal frolics on show. Yet its thoughtful cinema-verite style, faithfully tracking the awkward real-time conversations and knotty romances of a flat full of Chicago twentysomethings, elevates it way above the web's current rush of \"naked co-ed\" drama series. Keeping the performances as real as the characters' dilemmas, Swanberg directs, writes and stars as geeky, lovelorn Ben, crankily in love with the neurotically promiscuous Maggie in this opening series.

So we were happy to fall over this tucked-away test site for a series of uniformly sleek and witty playlets spoofing speed dating, created by Pirates of the Caribbean scribe Terry Rossio with Jocelyn Stamat.

Brazilian directing duo 300ml make very canny use of clips (and City of God star Seu Jorge) to create a unified field of conspiracy theory for Tarantino's movies, as a pair of fanboys engage in heated debate in a Rio diner as to whether his movies are actually one giant epic, divided into several episodes. Reflect on whether The Bride and Mia Wallace are actually the same person, if that famous Pulp Fiction twinkling briefcase contains the Reservoir Dog diamonds, why Roger Federer and Tarantino are never seen together, and make your own mind up.

  "<p>The 350m under-16s in China represent a big market and a huge opportunity to develop youth-orientated digital content, Wang Lifeng, the president of Chinese animation firm Xing Xing, told MediaGuardian's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/createinchina\">Create in China conference</a> today.</p> <p>As a result the animation industry in China was growing rapidly, with double-digit growth in consumption and production. But with state broadcaster CCTV spending little over \u00a31,000 per minute for its scheduled 7,000 hours of TV time for animation, it bred a poorer quality product on TV, Lifeng said.</p> <p>Yet the vast amount of domestic animation was low quality, Lifeng added, and most of China's 5,000 animation studios were small operations of fewer than 30 employees serving mainly local markets.</p> <p>Television remained the primary and most important outlet, but fledgling web and mobile services were emerging.</p> <p>Going global created the best opportunity for Chinese animation companies to create a viable businesses, Lifeng said. It could then look at serving the domestic market more fully.</p> <p><em>So how do animation companies grow and develop content?</em></p> <p>Xing Xing has two businesses, Lifeng said: outsourcing for the international market; and developing original content, again for an international audience. </p> <p>Co-production was a very important trend for Chinese media businesses, he said, not only just for capital and marketing but to bring some of the key talent to China to improve standards and attract outside interest.</p> <p><em>But isn't it just western-style animation?</em></p> <p>Yes, Lifeng said, but he saw a converging culture of taste for young Chinese: devouring western animation and then more domestic product as its quality improved - which, he said, would come through partnerships with foreign businesses.</p> <p><em>But isn't piracy putting people off investing in Chinese media?</em></p> <p>\"I'm not that worried about piracy. Even if 90% of the population use pirated material then, China is such a big country, the rest will be enough for a viable business,\" Lifeng said.</p>",
  "<p>One thing is missing from the blame game over who caused the global financial crisis. </p> <p>To recap, the finger has been pointed at greedy bankers, incompetent regulators, as well as conniving and inept government. But what about the City's vociferous and influential investors, the men and women who manage billions on behalf of our pensions funds and insurance companies? </p> <p>Were they just innocent bystanders who lost us shedloads of lolly when shares in housebuilders, banks and so on, began tanking 18 months ago?</p> <p>No. They were as much responsible for the credit bubble and credit bust as anyone else. An obsession with an extreme version of shareholder value meant they pressurised companies to extract bigger and bigger returns and argued the best way to achieve this goal was to take on extra debt in order to \"make balance sheets more efficient\". </p> <p>The shareholders who dominate the capital's skyline didn't want firms to sit on money in the bank because to do so was evidence of overcautious and, potentially, incompetent management. If HSBC had followed the City's advice, it would have been in hoc to the government in much the same way as RBS or HBOS.</p> <p>Groups \"hoarding\" cash were ordered to hand it back to investors in the form of higher dividends or via share buybacks. Companies which refused to leverage themselves to the hilt, such as Lloyds TSB, were pilloried as staid and boring; yet it was Lloyds which emerged as a safe haven when the crisis turned nasty. </p> <p>Banks, in general, and their credit card subsidiaries in particular, fuelled the consumer borrowing binge. But the City's finest (hedge fund investors were among the worst culprits) should take their fair share of the blame for the debt time bomb that was waiting to explode in our faces.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a>'s selection of Alaska governor <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin</a> to be his vice presidential running mate has thrust her state onto the world stage to an unprecedented degree. So far this situation has done little but tarnish Alaska's image. Palin's far-right politics, oppressive religious views, and dubious history have led many people to view Alaska as a corrupt, reactionary backwater. This is unfortunate - for in reality the state is a fascinating mix of European and Native American traditions, which exist in one of the most amazing environmental contexts imaginable. Fortunately there are many counterpoints that can be offered to Palin's Alaska. A particularly effective one is the state's former <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/poetry\">poet</a> laureate John Haines.</p> <p>Born in Norfolk, Virginia, the now octogenarian Haines, who currently resides in Montana, made Alaska his home for decades. Though he would later become a teacher, during his early years in the state Haines lived in classic frontiersman fashion, working as fur trapper in the region's remote interior. It was an experience that has deeply informed his work, which, as befitting a poet of such a vast, cold, and thinly populated land, is darkly introspective and often demanding. Haines's vision of Alaska is perhaps best exemplified in his early poems, such as The Hermitage, which chronicles the intense aloneness a person can feel in such an environment:</p> <p>I own a crevice stuffed with moss<br>and a couch of lemming fur;<br>I sit and listen to the music<br>of water dripping on a distant stone.<br>Or I sing to myself <br>of stealth and loneliness</p> <p>No one comes to see me<br>but I hear outside<br>the scratching of claws,<br>the warm, inquisitive breath \u2026</p> <p>Another excellent example along these lines is this excerpt from the visceral hunting piece Divided, the Man Dreaming:</p> <p>One half<br>lives in sunlight; he is<br>the hunter and calls<br>the beasts of the field<br>about him.<br>Bathed in sweat and tumult<br>he slakes and kills<br>eats meat<br>and knows blood</p> <p>As important as Haines's Alaska-based work is, he is far from a 'regional' poet. Though deeply based in these northern latitudes, he has traveled extensively (including a teaching stint in the UK) and studied widely - and his poetry often reflects this, with many locales coming into play and the subject matter of moose and snowdrifts often giving way to discussions of contemporary art and more free-floating metaphysics. In addition to his work as a poet, Haines is also an essayist of considerable worth, who often uses this medium to express a more overtly environmentalist philosophy.</p> <p>Haines has never been prolific as a writer and most of his poetry books are out of print and hard to come by. However, an excellent volume called <a href=\"http://www.graywolfpress.org/Related_Content/Book_Excerpts/Excerpt_from_The_Owl_in_the_Mask_of_the_Dreamer/\">The Owl in the Mask of the Dreamer</a>, which collects his works up to 1996, is widely available and highly recommended. A number of his essay collections are more readily found, though, with perhaps the best, or at least most representational in regards to his time in Alaska, being <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Stars-Snow-Fire-John-Haines/dp/155597306X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1224685721&amp;sr=8-1\">The Stars, the Snow, the Fire</a>, which collects works from the late 1970s up to the year 2000.</p> <p>Though a very readable writer, Haines's vision is often a tough one based on solitude and the difficult realities of life in a harsh, though beautiful landscape. However, for those disgusted with or just confused about Alaska because of the sudden rise of Sarah Palin, it might just be the perfect antidote for such feelings. In my opinion, the politics of the current Alaska governor represent the worst instincts of my home country. The poetry and essays of John Haines, on the other hand, embodies some of our most worthwhile traits. It also gives a deeper, and I would argue, more truthful portrait of America's 49th state.</p>",
  "<p>In setting out his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/21/globaleconomy-g8\">agenda for Bretton Woods II</a>, Professor Jeffrey Sachs has gone far. He proposes <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobin_tax\">a Tobin tax</a> \u2013 a tax that has been a bete noire of the international financial industry and hence the rich country's, especially US, governments. His rejection of emission trading in favour of a straightforward carbon tax is also bold \u2013 and in my view correct. </p> <p>There are many things, however, that he could have added in relation to the reform of the international financial system. For example, he could have proposed the introduction of a country bankruptcy code that will enable orderly sovereign debt restructuring. He could have talked not only of expanding the capital adequacy requirement, but also making it counter-cyclical, rather than pro-cyclical as it currently is. More strict regulations of tax havens and private equity funds, which have greatly contributed to increasing opacity in the financial market, should also have been mentioned. He could also have talked about the credit rating agencies. In light of the critical role they play in today's financial system and the damages they have inflicted by blessing all those toxic assets, these agencies need to be much more heavily regulated or even replaced by an international public body. All of these would have been compatible with his overall approach, so the differences between us in this regard are a matter of emphasis rather than of principles. </p> <p>However, I have some disagreements with Sachs's vision of how to reform the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/imf\">IMF, the World Bank</a>, and the world trading system. </p> <p>As for Sachs's proposal to turn the IMF into a proper lender-of-last-resort, I fear that a vastly strengthened IMF without a serious reform of its missions and its governance structure is likely to make things even worse. The IMF has caused great damage to developing (and former socialist) economies that have come under its tutelage by insisting on deflationary macroeconomic policies and premature financial de-regulation and opening up. Without abandoning these policies, an expanded IMF will be even more capable of inflicting damages on its client countries. </p> <p>Of course, the IMF has been able to continue with these problematic policies because the suffering countries do not have much say in the running of the organisation. Therefore, the voting shares in the IMF (and in the World Bank) need to be re-distributed in favour of developing countries. This is partly to reflect the dramatic changes in international economic power balances since its foundation, but more importantly to increase the voice of the \"customers\" (mostly developing countries), when there is no competitor to whom dissatisfied customers can turn.</p> <p>I am also not persuaded by Sachs's development strategy. I am all in favour of achieving the millennium development goals as soon as possible, but, unlike what its middle name suggests, the MDG is mainly about providing basic needs (health, education, and poverty reduction) and little about development in the true sense of the world \u2013 expansion and upgrading a country's productive capabilities. True, making individuals more productive through better health and education will increase a country's productive capabilities, but there is only so much that can be achieved through individual improvements. A lot of productive capabilities in modern economies need to be accumulated in the form of organisational routines and institutional memories in (public, private, and cooperative) productive enterprises through actual production experiences. To put it graphically, what really distinguish the US or Germany, on the one hand, and the Philippines or Nigeria, on the other hand, are their Boeings and Volkswagens, and not their economists or medical doctors. The achievement of the MDGs is a noble goal in itself, but it is not the same as development.</p> <p>Even more problematic is Sachs's support for \"aid for trade\" deal. In this deal, developing countries are asked to liberalise their trade in order to get the additional foreign aid that will enable them to make extra investment in skills and infrastructure. However, trade liberalisation will destroy, and make it very difficult to newly set up in the future, the very locales of accumulation of productive capabilities, namely, productive enterprises in high-productivity industries. This is why all of today's rich countries \u2013 starting from 18th century Britain and 19th century US and Germany, down to late 20th century South Korea and Taiwan \u2013 did not first invest in education and skills in general and then developed new industries. They first set up new enterprises with the help of (intelligently used, of course) protectionism and subsidies and then went on to invest in skills and technologies that those industries needed, as I document in my book, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/chap1/badsamaritans.htm\">Bad Samaritans</a>. Asking the developing countries to give up those policy tools is telling them to give up development.</p> <p>We need a more wide-ranging and more productivity-oriented approach than Sachs's, if we want to make the global system more productive, durable, and equitable.</p>",

To brush off those who wonder why India \u2013 the country with the world's greatest number of poor people \u2013 is spending $86m on repeating what the Americans, the Russians, the Chinese and the Japanese have already done, Indian space officials have talked of the holy grail of nuclear energy: <a href=\"http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/India-Moon-Mission-Chandrayaan-1-Launches-Into-Space-To-Investigate-Helium-3-Future-Fuel/Article/200810315125699?lpos=World_News_First_Home_Article_Teaser_Region_6&amp;lid=ARTICLE_15125699_India_Moon_Mission%3A_Chandrayaan-1_Launches_Into_Space_To_Investigate_Helium-3_Future_Fuel\">fusion</a>. </p> <p>You see, the moon has 5m tonnes of Helium 3 \u2013 which is the ideal fuel for nuclear fusion power. Fusion's the next new, new nuclear thing. Indian officials will tell anyone who asks that fusion creates four times as much energy as boring old nuclear fission. Although nuclear fusion can be best described as experimental, the technologists say it does not produce environmental problems like radioactive nuclear waste. The message is it is clean and green. To create the right amount of anxiety at home, the space officials will point out that Indians must act before the Chinese do. </p> <p>The Chinese have already worked out that <a href=\"http://www.dailygalaxy.com/my_weblog/2007/10/chinas-new-moon.html\">three space shuttle missions</a> a year could bring enough Helium 3 for the whole planet. These are not outright lies \u2013 just calculations not grounded in reality. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/10/22/fusion_greenpeace_no/\">Nuclear fusion</a> is the stuff that stars are made of. Basically, it's the energy released when two light atomic nuclei are smashed together to make a heavier one. All you need to do is heat gas up to the temperature of the centre of the sun and then design a material that can contain this superheated plasma and collect loads of neutrons. Although the science was worked out in the 1940s, fusion has led to the thermonuclear explosion and little else but a series of hugely expensive white elephants. The latest of which is the <a href=\"http://www.iter.org/\">International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER)</a> \u2013 a $12bn project backed by the US, the European Union, Japan, Russia, China, India and South Korea. </p> <p>No surprise, then, that they all have eyes on the moon. To sell a problem that has eluded science's best brains for more than half a century as a solution smacks of desperation. India is a nation with a proliferating development needs \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.financialexpress.com/news/India-ranks-66th-on-global-hunger-index/373336/\">global hunger index</a> ranks it below Laos and Burkina Faso. Hundreds of millions of Indians still openly defecate in fields, at roadsides and beside train tracks. Common tropical diseases easily overwhelm the country's poorly-funded public health system. Its roads, railways and airports all need money and managerial overhauls. </p> <p>It's not that India should not have a space programme. It should. To those who ask why bother to reach the moon, the answer is why did we bother to reach America. Human expansion is about expanding our capabilities. In that respect, India is precocious - doing many things well ahead of what countries usually do at similar stages of development. </p> <p>But with precocity can come a hubris that is hard to shake off in later life. Perhaps the country would do well to direct some of its remarkable talents to the more obvious, acute problems it faces on earth, rather than inventing reasons to reach for the stars.</p>",
  "<p>The safety of Chinese products was under the spotlight again today as the UN called for \"urgent revision\" of the country's food supervision system and Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, pledged to crack down on unscrupulous suppliers.</p> <p>China has seen a spate of safety scares over goods ranging from dumplings to toys, and is already battling to shore up its exports in the face of an appreciating currency and the global downturn.</p> <p>In the most recent scandal, milk products contaminated with the chemical melamine killed four babies and left tens of thousands ill. There were product recalls and export bans around the world.</p> <p>In a report released today, the United Nations warns that China's food exports could plummet without changes including an overarching watchdog and a single food safety law covering the \"farm-to-fork\" journey.</p> <p>\"The national system needs urgent review and revision,\" said Khalid Malik, the UN's resident coordinator for China.</p> <p>The report warns that at present the onus is on officials to prove there is a problem, rather than on businesses to ensure their products are safe. It highlights weaknesses in monitoring and says poor coordination means different government departments sometimes give the public different advice.</p> <p>Jorgen Schlundt, the World Health Organisation's food safety chief, said the melamine case showed \"that a disjointed system with dispersed authority resulted in poor communication and maybe prolonged [the] outbreak with a late response\".</p> <p>Today it emerged that three more children in the Chinese territory of Macau have developed kidney stones after drinking milk from the companies involved; Hong Kong officials have found cake containing \"excessive\" amounts of melamine; and South Korea has destroyed 23 tonnes of tainted Chinese-processed egg products.</p> <p>Yesterday the Associated Press reported that 1,500 dogs in China had died after eating melamine-tainted feed.</p> <p>The chemical, often used in plastic and fertilisers, should not be added to food. Suppliers use it to hide the fact that they have illicitly watered down milk, which when tested will seem like it contains normal levels of protein. The UN report warns that safety concerns could threaten China's food exports, which reached $27bn (\u00a316.5bn) in 2006. It acknowledges that China's level of substandard exports is relatively low compared to those of other countries, and that China is overhauling its food safety regime.</p> <p>Wal-Mart, which buys around $9bn of goods from China annually, has announced rigorous new standards for suppliers covering issues from product quality to working conditions and environmental sustainability.</p> <p>Among the measures are a pledge to drive returns on defective merchandise \"virtually out of existence\" by 2012 and a promise to slash energy use in stores. Suppliers will have to tell the company the name and location of every factory they use.</p> <p>\"I firmly believe that a company that cheats on overtime and on the age of its labour, that dumps its scraps and chemicals in our rivers, that does not pay its taxes or honour its contracts, will ultimately cheat on the quality of its products,\" said Lee Scott, the company's chief executive, speaking in Beijing at a specially convened conference for suppliers.</p> <p>The company was built on rock-bottom prices, but Scott acknowledged it was \"very likely\" some of the changes would result in higher prices in stores, lower profits for the company and smaller margins for suppliers.</p> <p>\"When we have bought overseas, we have purchased historically in a very transactional manner. We need deeper, longer-term relationships with suppliers so they are not based upon the last penny but provide a quality product at a very good price.</p> <p>\"Will there be people today, who subcontract to factories we should never have brought from, who go bust? Yes.\"</p> <p>Wal-Mart is regularly accused of squeezing suppliers on cost, resulting in contractors pushing down wages. Unions are not allowed in Wal-Mart's US stores.

  "<p>Peter Mandelson and Nat Rothschild are not the only people in search of revenge. After Gordon Brown gave David Cameron an unexpected duffing at the dispatch box the other day, the Conservative leader got his own back at noon. </p> <p>Cameron had to deliver a strong performance that steered well clear of the luxury yacht market because his mate, George Osborne, was in trouble in Corfu. He did so by again mocking Brown about the recession, dubbing him \"the master of dodgy accountancy\" and asking him if he was yet willing to admit he hadn't abolished boom and bust - as he so often boasted as chancellor.<br><br>Yes or no? Naturally he didn't get a straight answer. The PM endorsed Mervyn King's overnight talk of coming recession - at last. But he preferred to dwell on the global context, the disastrous role of the private sector in \"irresponsible lending\" and, of course, his own sterling work in putting things to right. </p> <p>In his five or six questions Cameron had not come up with a single constructive suggestion, he noted. At a time when judgment is needed the Tory leader had been wrong on major judgment calls such as the nationalisation of Northern Rock, recapitalising the banks and banning short selling for three months, Brown told MPs.</p> <p>But by that stage it was too late. Tory MPs were as determined as Cameron to cheer their way out of trouble over yachtgate. Labour MPs seemed subdued. Cameron's best line was not that Brown had claimed credit for the boom, but ducked blame for the bust. It was that Brown, the man who had overborrowed and hidden his own liabilities off the Treasury books - PFI, Northern Rock, not to mention pension obligation to public sector workers - is in no position to lecture bankers. Hence the \"master of dodgy accountancy\" jibe.</p> <p>Brown soldiered on well enough until Dennis Skinner threw him a lifeline - or rather hit him with a lifebelt. Whatever Brown had to do to save the economy, he must promise \"never ever\" to solicit money from Russian billionaires. It was the session's first mention of the Corfu controversy - extraordinary in itself. Labour MPs cheered and Brown solemnly replied that it was \"a very serious matter indeed and I hope it is being investigated by the authorities\".</p> <p>What did he mean by that? And investigated by whom? No 10 officials were later unable to explain.

  "<p>Taxes on draught beer in pubs should be cut to help save \"the local\" from extinction in many rural and suburban areas, MPs said today.</p> <p>They called on the government to consider different levies on beer served from a pump to those on bottled or canned beer to protect such \"national icons\".</p> <p>They hope this can combat what they see as an unfair advantage enjoyed by supermarkets, which could absorb tax rises in a way publicans on slender margins could not. Legally enforceable minimum prices for beer might be a long-term alternative, they said.</p> <p>A panel of the 400-member all-party parliamentary beer group claimed that the ability of big stores to offer beer or lager for as little as 90p for four cans - while a pint in a pub often costs drinkers seven times as much - would lead to a decline of the pub as a social centre where drinking could be controlled. </p> <p>Taxes on beer at present accounted for a third of the price. MPs said these were often absorbed by supermarkets. </p> <p>The tax changes were part of a package that included higher stake and prize-money limits for pub gambling machines, reduced business rates in return for their social role, simpler planning rules for pubs wanting to diversify, and easier licensing laws.</p> <p>The group receives office funding from 60 companies in the industry. Its panel's report, which follows a two-year inquiry, accused ministers of not paying sufficient attention to the role the local played in the social fabric. </p> <p>With pubs closing down at the \"astonishing rate\" of 36 a week, the report said communities risked losing a hub that provided local employment and sports sponsorship, bought local food, raised an average of \u00a33,300 a year for good causes and hosted services ranging from post offices, lunch clubs and shops to MPs' surgeries.</p> <p>\"This side of the pub trade has been largely overlooked in media coverage of licensing hours, law and order and binge drinking, and other problems more typically associated with large town centre pubs and bars... action taken in response to problems with perhaps 5 or 10% of the trade have caused further problems for the other 90 or 95%.\" </p> <p>Ministers should consider whether changes in tax regimes could \"reverse the trend away from drinking in public places or getting 'tanked up' at home before a night out, and back into the regulated environment of the pub.\"</p> <p>Nigel Evans, the Conservative MP for Ribble Valley and co-chair of the inquiry, said: \"We cannot sit back and let these gems disappear. They are the heart of the community. It is where all community life in some rural areas takes place.\"</p> <p>Janet Dean, the Labour MP for Burton and Uttoxeter, his fellow co-chair, said: \"There are some extraordinarily committed licensees out there, delivering a remarkable array of activities, but they are labouring against the twin evils of cheap supermarket beer and a regulatory backlash from government seeking to curb alcohol disorder problems not of their making.\"</p>",
  "<p>The United Nations today called for a refocusing of the world's economy towards investments in clean technologies and natural infrastructures such as forests in a Green New Deal that could revive the stumbling global economy, combat climate change, and cut poverty.</p> <p>The UN's Environment Programme (UNEP) said the financial, fuel and food crises of 2008 highlighted the need for an innovative approach similar to the state-funded scheme used by US president Franklin D Roosevelt, in response to the Great Depression. </p> <p>The organisation, supported by governments and top economists, is calling for - and believes it will achieve - decisive government action when finance ministers meet for the Financing for Development-Doha Review conference next month in New York.</p> <p>\"Transformative ideas need to be discussed and transformative decisions taken,\" said Achim Steiner, the US undersecretary general and UNEP executive director. </p> <p>\"The alternative is more boom and bust cycles; a climate-stressed world and a collapse of fish stocks and fertile soils up to forest ecosystems,\" he added. </p> <p>It was only a matter of time before investments would begin pouring back into the global economy but they should no longer be aimed at the \"old, extractive, short-term economy of tomorrow,\" but a new green economy that could provide opportunities for the poor and well-off alike, said Pavan Sukdhev. </p> <p>Sukdhev, a head of global markets for Deutsche Bank, has been seconded to work on <a href=\"http://www.unep.org/\">UNEP's Green Economy Initiative</a>, which is funded with \u00a32m of cash from the European commission, Germany and Norway and which draws strong links between ecosystem losses and the persistence of poverty in the developing world.</p> <p>\"The economic models of the 20th century are now hitting the limits of what is possible - possible in terms of delivering better livelihoods for the 2.6 billion people still living on less than $2 a day and possible in terms of our ecological footprint,\" explained Sukdhev. </p> <p>The initiative highlights five sectors which are likely to offer the best payback in terms of economic returns, environmental sustainability and job creation. </p> <p>These are clean energy and new technologies including recycling; rural energy including renewables and biomass; sustainable agriculture including organic cultivation; ecosystem infrastructure and reduced emissions from deforestation, and sustainable cities including green building and transport.</p> <p>The UN points out that \u00a3150bn is spent annually on agricultural subsidies with very little going into reforestation. It says that roughly the same amount of public investment currently goes into energy - much to fossil fuels - yet 2 billion people globally do not have electricity, oil or gas to cook food and provide heat and light.</p> <p>Sukhdev added: \"Here you have some of the choices in a nutshell. If we are to lift 2.6 billion people living on less than $2 a day out of poverty, do we put them into making more and more motor cars, TVs and PCs, or do we invest in the protected area network and develop its potential for green and decent new jobs?\"</p> <p>An additional investment of \u00a325bn a year in some 100,000 conservation areas worldwide would secure the \u00a32.5tr worth of services provided by these natural assets \"while generating millions of new jobs and securing livelihoods for rural and indigenous peoples,\" he said.</p> <p>Andrew Simms, the policy director at the New Economics Foundation in London, which called this summer for its own <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/19/creditcrunch.marketturmoil\">Green New Deal</a>, said the UNEP initiative was highly important. </p> <p>\"The UN report has seen what several governments, including our own have failed to. It's 'now or never,' with the clock ticking on the global oil economy and the countdown to a new, more perilous phase of climate upheaval. Instead of scrabbling to return the economy to business-as-usual, this could be our last chance save the economy and prevent environmental bankruptcy.\"</p> <p>Last month, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/25/climate.jobs\">UN published another major report</a>, which claimed that far from destroying jobs, tackling climate change would boost employment.</p> <p>The Green Jobs study was hailed as being crucial to overcoming global resistance from the labour movement, which for many years opposed the Kyoto agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions amid fears that members would lose their jobs.</p>",
  "<p>I received an intriguing email a couple of weeks ago. The <a href=\"http://www.scriptologist.com/Magazine/Tips/Logline/logline.html\">logline</a> for my first short film, Maconie's List is registered on <a href=\"http://www.inktip.com/index.php\">InkTip.com</a>. To recap, it's the story of a lonely, depressed woman who hires <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2007/jun/21/ladiary19lookingforaknac\">a hitman</a> to kill her on her 40th birthday, only to change her mind at the last minute when she gets asked out on date. It's not autobiographical, honest guv.</p> <p>InkTip is one of those wonderful sites that you only get to hear about through people \"in the know\"; essentially it's where producers, directors and others go to find original material. It can be lucrative too; a friend of mine here made $4,000 out of a script deal via the site.<br> So out of nowhere a girl called Grace emailed to say that she was looking for a play to perform at her college finals and wanted to know if I would let her adapt my short. <br></p> <p>Having written a couple of plays that were critiqued at the Soho Theatre, I jumped at the chance. I love that form of writing and <a href=\"http://www.crackle.com/c/Drama_Short_Films/Maconie_s_List/2098681#ml=o%3d7%26fcx%3d170%26fk%3dmaconie's%2520list%26fx%3d\">Maconie's List</a> lends itself very nicely to theatre. It's linear, the sets are simple and it's dialogue/character heavy. I have a few ideas for the adaptation which involve cherry picking the best bits of my original script with the best bits of the shooting script but ultimately, it'll be up to Grace to bring it to life. Why's that? Well, I'm in LA and she's studying performing arts at a college in Cumbria.</p> <p>I'll keep you posted on how the project develops. Meanwhile, I could have sworn I was at Barfly in Camden on Saturday for <a href=\"http://www.ardenkaywin.com/\">Arden Kaywin</a>'s album launch. She was the girl I met on the plane to New York last month and along with an enthusiastic crowd of friends, family and fans I watched her perform a short set at <a href=\"http://www.themintla.com/\">The Mint</a> on Pico. </p> <p>Strutting around the stage in her little green mini-dress, she totally rocked. I love her stuff, it's intelligent and quirky, and I'm not just saying that because she's going to read this; me and my housemate have been playing her record around the house. One of her songs from the album, The Elephant in the Room, was used in the film <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0852713/\">The House Bunny</a>, only you won't hear it because the scene was cut. And as Arden told me with a sad face, \"that means I don't get paid\". Oh well, them's the breaks but <a href=\"http://www.seventeen.com/fun-stuff/17-buzz/arden-kaywin-new-album\">she's getting good press</a> and I can see her becoming a big star. </p> <p>The Mint is one of those long established LA venues, like the Formosa, that I make a point of rooting out. Owners past and present have been careful to preserve the essence of what made it special in the first place and even though some years back one set of owners bought the premises next door, it's still small enough to have that cosy rock vibe. The guy on the door was the size of a Hummer and there were vinyl records stuck to the ceiling. It was great. </p> <p>Best of all, it was very un-LA, and by that I mean that the clientele were made up of the kind of crowd you'd see at a gig anywhere. Typically at a party in LA the room will be botox deep in models, actors and other-worldly creatures so beautiful/thin/flawless that your eyes start running. I'm still in awe of the up-close effects of cosmetic surgery. It's bloody awful and I know I'll never succumb. Having said that watching someone's forehead not move during a conversation is a singular form of entertainment.</p> <p>Fortunately, I'm having a few days off from the young and the beautiful. I'm in <a href=\"http://www.filmsantabarbara.com/\">Santa Barbara</a> for a couple of days with my writer/producer friend Tanya, who is on the verge of being either very famous, or very rich, or both. I can't quite work out which but I've told her that I'll be her <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kato_Kaelin\">Kato Kaelin</a> and live in her guesthouse when she buys her fortress in the Hollywood Hills. Her dog Lily died last week, which was very sad, and I don't even like dogs. This place changes you. Pass the botox.</p>",
  "<p>Two things have always marked out <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/banking\">the financial masters</a> of the universe from the rest of us. First, their souped-up salaries, and then their souped-up working hours. We mortals understood that these were connected. The rewards were so high because the hours were so long. No question of flexible or part-time working for them. If they weren't in the office, they were entertaining clients or building team spirit, and were regularly expected to work into the small hours. Perhaps they could snatch a moment in the gym, but this was only to help them maintain their awesome stamina \u2013 the stamina to remain effective while working round the clock, and make crucial decisions after only a few hours' sleep.</p> <p>Now that their decision-making powers have been called into question, together with the notion that paying someone spectacularly big bucks guarantees an excellent job done, perhaps it is time to question their working culture too.</p> <p>Instead, by suggesting that plans to extend flexible working rights <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/20/workandcareers-worklifebalance\">should be delayed</a> in order to help <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/21/mandelson-worklifebalance\">business survive</a> the economic downturn, the government appears to have fallen back on the old-fashioned idea that long-hours culture brings net benefits. </p> <p>My maths may not be up to running a hedge fund, but there is something that doesn't add up here. Why does the threat of thousands of people working less than they would like mean employers want to force hundreds of other people to work more than they would like? </p> <p>Shouldn't this be the ideal opportunity for us to share the work around, and achieve what must be the aim of a healthy modern society \u2013 lots of people working, but a bit less? Indeed, last night the government's equality <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/22/mandleson-equality-maternity-recession\">watchdog condemned</a> the proposal to scrap improvements in parents' rights to flexible working, and released research showing a demand from both mothers and fathers for it. </p> <p>One problem is the people making strategic decisions about our working lives \u2013 be they politicians or business leaders \u2013 are themselves the products of a culture that rewards long hours. Those at the top tend to be workaholics.</p> <p>As a result, they rarely take into consideration the benefits of time spent not working \u2013 the time free from the dazzle of the strip lighting and the air-conditioning, when you notice that not everyone thinks the way you do, earns what you earn, wants what you want. These kinds of observations can come in useful.</p> <p>As technology takes over more and more of the mundane aspects of working life, business success increasingly rests on the ability to think laterally, innovate, and manage human relationships \u2013 the so-called knowledge economy. How do you come up with new ideas, or learn to relate to other people, if you spend all your daylight hours in a conference room, with occasional forays to the water cooler? Wouldn't businesses, and other institutions, so long as they are well managed, only benefit from having staff who can regularly bring with them experiences from outside the office environment \u2013 not to mention a happier workforce.</p> <p>Had bankers been more involved in the weekly supermarket shop they may have pondered the fact that not everyone can afford a home of their own. Had they been hanging out in the odd playground, it may have struck them that there are people who might sign up for a mortgage without really reading the small print, because someone else eager to pay their own mortgage suggests it's a good idea. In fact, didn't the whole sub-prime debacle derive from a failure to relate a bunch of figures to the realities of day-to-day life?</p> <p>I'm sure there is some kind of multi-coloured chart or flow diagram that can explain why in the real business world, these questions are naive. But, if nothing else, the past few months have shown that we should have been asking a few more naive questions, and should have ignored the big banking bosses when they told us not to worry our pretty little heads about what they were doing in all those hours they spent in the office.</p>",

The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority says tens of thousands of seabirds are failing to breed because warmer water from more frequent and intense El Ni\u00f1o events means there is insufficient food to raise their young.

  "<p>I've had this <a href=\"http://www.upsettherhythm.co.uk\">Upset! The Rhythm</a> CD-R lying around the house for a while now. I've been meaning to write about it, but you know how it is - meetings on bush fires to attend, wasp nests to knock down, mesh screen doors to mend. I've got days to while away, sunscreen to apply. Also, it seemed far too obvious for me to talk about LA duo <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/thesoftboiledeggies\">Softboiled Eggies</a> \u2013 the CD-R was forwarded several weeks ago by <a href=\"http://www.planbmag.com\">Plan B</a> publisher Frances Morgan with a small post-it note shaped like a speech bubble saying, \"You might like this, you might not. This sounds like Everett True music to me, but that means it could go either way!\"</p> <p>The reason I haven't written about this CD-R yet, is that, well, I really don't have a problem with this gorgeous, intimate, enveloping, dub-flecked, heart-warming, playful music \u2013 and I wonder if I should. Is my life so cyclical that am I fated to rediscover music that I never fell out of love with in the first place?</p> <p>Perhaps it's a side effect of parenthood. The energy that would otherwise go towards nurturing new music is diverted into raising your kids \u2013 and that it's far simpler to take a less challenging route when your son is competing for your ears with the stereo and the building works outside at 6am. So it's best to put on <a href=\"http://www.fridahyvonen.com\">gentler sounds</a>. Having a three-year-old tends to obviate the need for death metal.</p> <p>I mean, Softboiled Eggies don't just play \"[horrible] Everett True music\" \u2013 a description that was coined by Manic Street Preachers' bassist Nicky Wire back in the early 90s to describe a far more abrasive sound, somewhere between early Guided By Voices and the <a href=\"http://thebumpideereader.blogspot.com\">early Riot Grrrls</a>. Softboiled Eggies play absolute heartland Everett True music.</p> <p>And to do that, they have to be entirely in tune \u2013 melodically, spatially, mentally, rhythmically \u2013 with a certain (female-led) post-punk, Rough Trade Records-championed sound that happened between 1979 and 1983. (We'll allow for a certain movement on either side.) Music that understood the importance and magnitude of Lee \"Scratch\" Perry, Al Green, Can and Here and Now, and other artists bypassed by mainstream music magazines.</p> <p>It's been pointed out by an (Australian) Plan B writer that Softboiled Eggies are clearly in love with the rainy Sunday afternoons in the early 80s \u2013 we're specifically talking New Age Steppes, the Leopards, the gentler side of Au Pairs, and <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/theraincoats\">the Raincoats</a>. (Softboiled Eggies even cover Only Loved at Night from the Raincoats' second album Odyshape so lovingly I can't find it in my heart to dislike it: and it doesn't even make me want to race back to play the Raincoats' first two albums \u2026 well, no more than usual.) And any American influences that result, happen only because of shared influence, a commonality. (The glorious Phil Spector-via-Trixie's <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/trixiesbigredmotorbike\">Big Red Motorbike</a> thrills of Softboiled Eggies' Glassy Eyes reminds me of the first Beat Happening song I ever heard, Foggy Eyes \u2026 but that's another story.)</p> <p>Am I wrong to love Softboiled Eggies when they remind me so indelibly of my past?

His first PMQs of the autumn was a bit of a failure; almost all commentators said it was a (rare) straight sets win for <strong>Gordon Brown</strong>.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>11.52am:</strong> He and Brown did not appear last week and today, with the Tories on the back foot over yachtgate (sorry - I just couldn't think of another shorthand for it), Cameron must feel under pressure to deliver a knock-out performance.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>11:57am:</strong> Luckily, there's a good issue for him to hand. Does Brown agree with Mervyn King that Britain is \"entering a recession\"? Brown ought to be able to deal with this by simply saying yes, but he's never admitted that we're heading into a recession before (which would amount to an admission that the era of boom and bust has returned, contrary to what we were told ad nauseam while he was at the Treasury) and he's not very good at facing up to this sort of thing. Sometimes in the past he's preferred to squirm rather than acknowledge an unpalatable truth. It'll be interesting to see what he does this afternoon.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>12:03pm:</strong> Brown starts with condolences to the family of a soldier killed in Afghanistan, Trooper James Munday.</p> <p>He also sends his condolences to the family of Gayle Williams, the charity worker killed by the Taliban. It was a \"barbaric act\".</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>12:05pm: Jim Sheridan</strong> (Lab, Paisley and Renfrewshire North) asks Brown to assure him that measures will be taken to stop people losing their homes.</p> <p>Brown says he's announcing new guidance to the judiciary today that should make it easier for people to stay in their homes.</p> <p>He raises the King speech. He says that he agrees with King about the banking system coming close to collapse. He does not use the R word.</p> <p>A summit of global leaders will be announced this afternoon. Brown will attend.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>12:06pm:</strong> </p> <p><strong>David Cameron</strong></p> <p>The Tory leader also pays tribute to the dead soldier and aid worker.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>12:06pm:</strong> In the first six months of the year the government borrowed \u00a337bn. At the end of a long boom, and just as the downturn is beginning, borrowing is going up. Is that a mistake?</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>12:07pm:</strong> Brown quotes Cameron on the radio earlier this week saying that borrowing does go up in a downturn. This gets a good response from the Labour side. Which side is Cameron on?</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>12:09pm:</strong> Cameron says of course borrowing goes up in a downturn. The problem is Brown \"racked it up to record levels\" before the downturn began. Look at the items the government's borrowing figures do not include, he says, referring to PFI etc. </p> <p>Brown could not lecture the banks on borrowing because he borrowed so much himself, and he could not lecture them on transparency either, the Tory leader says. Brown is a \"master of dodgy accounting\". There's lots of heckling. Half of the OECD had budget surpluses when they went into downturn. Did Brown have no regrets?</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>12:11pm:</strong> Brown says he cut the levels of debt. Does Cameron want him to close schools and hospitals? Net debt is lower than it is in countries like the US and Japan. Brown quotes Cameron again, saying \"People will want cross-party support.\" Cameron says \"one thing one week, one thing the next week\".</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>12:11pm:</strong> Cameron says he has support on the banking deal, but not on borrowing. For years Brown was telling the public about \"prudence with a purpose\". Now he's going on about borrowing with a purpose. Cameron mentions King's comments and recessions and asks Brown if he will accept that the boom is being followed by a bust.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>12:13pm:</strong> Brown says: \"I've already said I agree with the governor of the Bank of England.\" A coded admission that we are going into recession, I think. How very Brownish. He goes on to quote Cameron saying that opposition politicians should not talk down the economy.</p> <p>Cameron says Brown is the cause of the problem. Will Brown finally admit that he did not abolish boom and bust?</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>12:14pm:</strong> Again, Brown says he's already answered the point about the Bank of England governor (which is not what Cameron asked this time). Everyone knows that this is a problem that originated in America, he says. </p> <p>If the Tories are really interested in supporting small businesses, they should be supporting what the government is doing. If the Tories cannot understand the problem, they won't have a solution, the prime minister says.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>12:15pm:</strong> Cameron says everyone knows that Brown took credit for the boom, and so they expect him to acknowledge the bust. He puts the question again: has Brown abolished boom and bust?</p> <p>Brown says there is no return to the days of 15% interest rates. Politicians will be judged on their decisions. He criticises Tory policy in various areas, like Northern Rock.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>12:16pm:</strong> Cameron tries again: \"Why not admit, for once in your life, you have not ended boom and bust?\"</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>12:17pm:</strong> Brown accuses Cameron of not mentioning any policies and not living up to what he said about supporting the government. The Tories have no \"constructive policies\".</p> <p><strong>Energy prices</strong></p> <p>Brown says the government will monitor energy prices, to see whether customers are benefiting from the fall in oil prices.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>12:18pm:</strong> </p> <p><strong>Nick Clegg</strong></p> <p>The Lib Dem leader also offers his condolences to the dead soldier and aid worker.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>12:18pm:</strong> The public have seen the government offer a bail-out to the banks. When will there be a bail-out for pensioners facing poverty this winter, Clegg asks.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>12:19pm:</strong> Brown says he has been putting liquidity into the banking system for months (implying that he did not just decide to help them at the last moment). On pensioners Brown says Clegg knows that the pension is more than \u00a330 a week - a clever reference to Clegg's conference gaffe, when he said the state pension was worth \u00a330 a week, instead of about \u00a390 a week. Brown also mentions policies that will help pensioners.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>12:21pm:</strong> Clegg says Brown is \"all at sea\", but unlike other MPs not on a luxury yacht (the only reference to yachtgate so far). </p> <p>Will Brown agree to change the way energy tariffs are priced, so that people have an incentive to use less? (This is Lib Dem policy - they don't like the way standing charges meant that people in effect pay most for the first chunk of energy they use, then less for the extra energy they use on top of that.)</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>12:23pm:</strong> Brown says the Lib Dems would have more credibility if they had not promised \u00a320bn of spending cuts.</p> <p><strong>Energy</strong></p> <p>Brown says he will not take the advice of the Tories on this. Their fuel duty stabiliser plan would mean fuel duty would now be going up.</p> <p><strong>Business rates</strong></p> <p><strong>John Whittingdale</strong> (Con, Maldon and East Chelmsford) asks Brown to reinstate business rates relief for empty property.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>12:25pm:</strong> Brown says he will look at this.</p> <p><strong>Women</strong></p> <p><strong>Lynda Waltho</strong> (Lab, Stourbridge) asks Brown to promise not to hire a PR firm to get into women's \"pretty little heads\". It's a reference to the PR company advising the Tories on how to make themselves more popular with women.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>12:26pm:</strong> Brown says he doesn't need to do this.</p> <p><strong>Public services</strong></p> <p>Brown says St Helen's hospital is being opened today - the 100th new hospital being built under the government's hospital renovation programme.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>12:26pm:</strong><br> <strong>Ex-servicemen in prison</strong></p> <p><strong>Elfyn Llwyd</strong>, Plaid Cymru's leader in Westminster, asks Brown to help support ex-servicemen in prison, who he says account for 10% of the prison population.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>12:27pm:</strong> Brown says the government is working on this issue to get accurate data about the number of people involved, and to see what can be done to help.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>12:29pm:</strong> </p> <p><strong>Manchester congestion charge</strong></p> <p><strong>Graham Stringer</strong> (Lab, Manchester Blackley) asks about the referendum in Manchester on its proposed congestion charge. He's opposed to the charge and he claims the question is biased.</p> <p>Brown says the question had to be approved legally.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>12:30pm:</strong><br> <strong>Gun and knife crime</strong></p> <p><strong>Karen Buck</strong> (Lab, Regent's Park and Kensington North) says there is evidence showing that some people are carrying guns or knives because media reports about the prevalence of gun and knife crime have frightened them into thinking its necessary.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>12:31pm:</strong> Brown mentions some of the initiatives the government has taken on this. The important thing is to \"change the whole culture\" relating to carrying knives.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>12:32pm:</strong> </p> <p><strong>Water charges</strong></p> <p>In response to a question from <strong>Adrian Sanders</strong> (Lib Dem, Torbay) about water charges in south-west England, Brown says the region has benefited from Labour.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>12:32pm:</strong> </p> <p><strong>Yachtgate</strong></p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-338878875\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1872537374_gdn-nat-20081022-jd-pmq-economy-4x3.flv\"/> </video>   <p>Dennis Skinner (Lab, Bolsover) asks for an assurance that, however desperate the nation's finances get, Brown will never meet a Russian billionaire to try to get some money. It's a very fun, but pointed question - classic Skinner.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>12:35pm:</strong> There's lots of laughter, but Brown says it's a serious issue. He says he hopes that the matter is investigated \"by the authorities\". It's not clear what authorities he's referring to - the parliamentary commissioner for standards? - but it certainly takes the story on. No doubt we'll find out later what Brown is expecting.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>Instant summary</strong></p> <p><strong>David Cameron:</strong> Good, but not his best performance. His questions about borrowing did not work well, but he challenged Brown effectively over the end of boom and bust four times in a row in a way that should play well on the news bulletins.</p> <p><strong>Gordon Brown:</strong> Is he being better briefed? He used Cameron quotes against the Tory leader quite powerfully. It undermined Cameron in the chamber, but also depicted Cameron to a wider audience as inconsistent, which is an important political message.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>Brown on the recession:</strong> A non-admission admission. He never acknowledged that Britain is heading into recession in direct language, but by saying that he agreed with King he was implicitly accepting this. He made a point of saying this twice, just to make sure that we got the message. The media can now report Brown as accepting that we're going into recession. That means that when he does utter the word directly, he'll no doubt turn round and say: \"What's the big deal? I've admitted this before.\"</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>A yachtgate probe?</strong> Dennis Skinner's question was brilliant. And, by calling for an investigation, Brown is doing his best to keep this story in the news. \"Tory sleaze\" was a fantastic vote winner for Labour in the 1990s and Brown is clearly keen for a rerun.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>Nick Clegg:</strong> Clegg made a good point about pensioners and the bankers. But Brown cut his legs off with the joke about the \u00a330 pension.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>Update:</strong> I was wrong about Brown on the recession. Having checked the quotes, I see that he did utter the word directly, in relation to Britain, but it was convoluted (which is probably why I missed it). </p> <p>This is what he said: \"The governor of the Bank of England said last night that not since the first world war has the international banking system been so close to collapse, and I agree with him. Having taken action on the banking system, we must now take action on the global financial recession which is likely to cause recession in America, France, Italy, Germany, Japan and - because no country can insulate itself from it - Britain too.\"</p>",
  "<p>In the aftermath of the tragic <a href=\"http://www.dignitas.ch/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=117&amp;Itemid=166\">suicide at Dignitas</a> in Switzerland of Daniel James, the 23-year-old British man paralysed in a rugby accident, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/19/euthanasia-daniel-james-health-law\">Mary Warnock</a> made an elegantly reasoned argument for legalising assisted suicide. But I disagree with her conclusion. <br> Impassioned arguments for legalisation by other commentators often fail to consider the implications of taking such a radical step. US Supreme Court chief justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote that \"hard cases make bad law\". The cases of <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1682546.stm\">Diane Pretty</a>, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7644094.stm\">Debbie Purdy</a> and Daniel James are indeed hard, involving as they do a fully functioning mind trapped in a body that is \u2013 or soon will be \u2013 an unresponsive shell. It's no coincidence that the assisted suicide cases that have been the subject of high court rulings in the UK, the US and Canada have involved patients suffering from motor neurone disease (called ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease in the US). <br> In several <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/yasmin-alibhai-brown/yasmin-alibhaibrown-it-must-be-right-to-let-people-decide-if-they-want-to-die-966944.html\">commentaries</a> I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/13/death-assistedsuicide\">have read</a>, logic has vanished into a terminological fog as disparate terms \u2013 assisted dying, assisted suicide, physician-assisted suicide and mercy killing are confused and conflated. Those who disagree are labeled as religious zealots. While it's true that many opponents are motivated by religious convictions, others \u2013 such as myself \u2013 are not. <br> The rush to legalisation neglects a fundamental difference between legal and moral judgements. While what is legal and what is ethical often overlap, in compelling cases, there's a strong temptation to set a precedent that can become problematic when enshrined in laws applying to everyone and every case. I oppose legalisation, because of the unavoidable risk of abuse, a risk that is particularly clear in the American context in which I've spent most of my life. Our radical individualism undermines solidarity. Our medical culture is rife with self-interest and distrust, engendered by extreme litigiousness and insurance companies that stand between patients and their physicians.  In 1997, when the constitutionality of physician assisted suicide came before the US Supreme Court, solicitor general Walter Dellinger, representing the Clinton administration, made an argument with which I agree: terminally ill patients have a liberty interest in not having the state prevent their relief from severe pain and suffering through physician-<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9407EEDE1F39F93AA35752C0A961958260&amp;sec=health&amp;spon=&amp;&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=dellinger%20assisted%20suicide&amp;st=cse\">assisted suicide</a>. However, this interest is trumped by the need to protect vulnerable patients. The systemic dangers are \"dramatic\" in a society that allows doctor-assisted suicide, Dellinger said. \"The least costly treatment for any illness is lethal medication.\" Although the court found no constitutionally protected right to physician-assisted suicide, individual states could choose to permit it. Eleven years on, only Oregon has made that choice. <br> Britain has been my second home long enough for me to see the solidarity of NHS fraying in the face of financial pressures. <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4848646.stm\">Medical care for the elderly</a> can fall below the standard of adequacy and even common decency. Financial considerations are pervasive. <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/oxfordshire/7678843.stm\">GPs are receiving incentives</a> not to refer patients to hospital. Rationing decisions for cancer drugs are often in the news. Rationing will come to resemble battlefield triage as the population ages and more expensive technologies and drugs become available. In this environment, legalised assisted suicide would allow or even invite coercion. Those who are in pain or receiving sub-standard care are in no position to make a voluntary choice. Going gently into that good night is certainly the least costly alternative. <br> The law requires bright lines. Could the line hold if Lord Joffe's bill becomes law and physician-assisted suicide is permitted for the terminally ill? One could argue that terminal illness isn't a morally relevant criterion; others who are ill \u2013 like Debbie Purdy \u2013 suffer grievously. The most acute suffering can be psychological. What about a paralysed young person who has lost the will to live \u2013 like Daniel James or <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/14/international/europe/14france.html\">Vincent Humbert</a> in France? An elderly person with nothing to look forward to can also suffer \u2013 like the healthy 79-year-old <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/03/world/europe/03germany.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=assisted%20suicide%20german%20woman&amp;st=cse&amp;oref=slogin\">German woman</a> who was helped to die? Some years ago, a Dutch jurist named <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/328/7449/1204\">Huib Drion</a> suggested that a suicide pill be made available to all 75 year olds who lived alone. Don't we find ourselves at the bottom of a slippery slope after a slide that was as incremental as it was inevitable? <br> How should British courts deal with someone who has taken a loved one to Switzerland to die and then returns to the UK? In my view, assisting a suicide requires more than accompanying someone on an airplane. The way forward is not to change the law in Britain to make it consistent with Swiss law, which allows for the actions of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/05/health.law\">Dignitas</a>. Neither the Dutch nor the state of Oregon offers end-of-life services for non-residents. They require the existence of an established doctor-patient relationship through which mental state and the durability of the request can be assessed. The Swiss have sunk to the lowest common moral denominator. The British people deserve better.</p>",

  "<h2>David Kern, economic adviser to the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC)</h2> <p>\"The new MPC minutes, and the alarming messages conveyed by governor Mervyn King in his speech to Leeds Chamber of Commerce, highlight the big risks facing the UK economy. The minutes acknowledge that the threat to growth has worsened sharply, while inflation is set to fall after its current peak. </p> <p>\"We strongly believe that a further cut in interest rates to 4% in November would be an important step aimed at alleviating the severity of the recession and to help restore business and consumer confidence.\"</p> <h2>Vicky Redwood at Capital Economics</h2> <p>She believes that October's MPC minutes echo the \"gloomy tone\" of Mervyn King's speech last night and suggest that the committee will continue to act aggressively in cutting rates. </p> <p>\"Not only did all members vote for the 50bps cut, but the discussion was unambiguously dovish. The case for leaving rates on hold (or indeed cutting by 25bps) wasn't even discussed, with the balance of risks to inflation judged to have shifted decisively to the downside,\" she said. </p> <p>\"The committee noted the substantial deterioration in the outlook for economic activity. And it even sounded fairly cautious about how much good the government's bank recapitalisation would do the economy in the near-term. Lastly, there was talk in both the minutes and King's speech about the growing risk of an undershoot of the inflation target. A November rate cut is looking pretty certain, with a good chance that it's another 50bps. And we see rates getting to 2.5% or lower next year.\"</p> <h2>Howard Archer at Global Insight</h2> <p>\"The tone of the minutes are very gloomy, noting that the outlook for UK economic activity had deteriorated substantially, the prospects for main export markets had worsened and credit conditions were extremely tight. As a result, the MPC were clearly concerned that an extended, deep economic downturn and faster rising unemployment could lead to inflation undershooting its 2.0% target over the medium term.</p> <p>\"A plethora of recent very weak data and survey evidence leaves little, if any, doubt that the UK is now well on its way into recession, thereby intensifying pressure on the Bank of England to cut interest rates aggressively further.\"</p> <h2>George Buckley at Deutsche Bank</h2> <p>Buckley said that the tone of the conclusion and summing up in these minutes is \"overwhelmingly bearish\" about economic growth and clearly less concerned about implications of high current levels of inflation.<br> \"They are a lot more concerned about inflation undershooting its target in two years' time. When we come to see the inflation report at the start of next month, it will show inflation falling quite rapidly,\" he said. </p> <p>\"They'll be more confident that inflation will fall rapidly and that we won't see these second round effects which have been one of the risks they have been identifying.\"<br> </p> <h2>James Knightley at ING</h2> <p>\"They acknowledged that it is difficult to gauge how far rates would eventually need to fall, but there was clearly sufficient information to justify a 50 basis point move. </p> <p>\"We continue to look for further aggressive moves in coming months as the activity numbers weaken and inflation starts to fall sharply (the petrol price war is a clear help here). </p> <p>\"Our base case is currently that the policy rate will be cut to 2.75% in the first half of 2009, but the risks are skewed to the downside given we look for four consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth.\" </p>",
  "<p>If the Nairobi Stock Exchange index was to plunge by the margins witnessed in major capitals across the world, you would be more likely to see celebrations in the streets than the recriminations witnessed from New York to London.</p> <p>That's simply down to the gross inequalities in Kenya where players in the stockmarket are viewed as beneficiaries of recent economic growth \u2013 to the exclusion of the vast poor majority.</p> <p>People in those parts of the country that enjoy political patronage live 16 years longer <a href=\"http://www.inequalitykenya.or.ke/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=5\">than others</a> and the 10% richest households control more than 42% of incomes while the poorest 10% make do with 0.76% \u2013 so the resentment is not surprising.</p> <p>Indeed, the opposition <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Democratic_Movement\">Orange Democratic Movement</a> (ODM) partly campaigned on a platform of ensuring greater equity at the last election and its leaders explicitly attacked players in the stockmarket as the poster boys of an economic model that fosters inequality.</p> <p>Yet despite the generally ambivalent attitude to the global economic slowdown (and occasional smug, tongue-in-cheek letter to the editor suggesting that Kenyans chip in some aid to buffeted western states) the crisis poses a significant threat to millions across sub-Saharan Africa.</p> <p>The danger is that remittances from Africans in the diaspora could decline as their incomes are affected in the west, with a potentially devastating effect for households in the continent and beyond.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTDECPROSPECTS/0,,contentMDK:21352016~isCURL:Y~menuPK:3145470~pagePK:64165401~piPK:64165026~theSitePK:476883,00.html\">Migration and Remittances Factbook 2008</a> indicates that Kenya, for example, receives more cash in remittances ($1.3 billion or \u00a3748m in 2007) than it does net foreign direct investment (about $50.4m per year) or overseas development aid (roughly $200m a year).</p> <p>These inflows have a major impact on the economy. They have contributed to a real estate boom, boosted the investment of households on health and education and significantly increased household incomes.</p> <p><a href=\"http://econ.worldbank.org/external/default/main?theSitePK=1572893&amp;contentMDK=20693491&amp;pagePK=64168182&amp;piPK=6416806\">According</a> to the World Bank, money from the diaspora improved household income in Uganda by 11%, in Bangladesh by six per cent and in Ghana by five per cent. These are significant sums by any measure, and although much has been made of the fact that the troubles in the world economy may lead to a decline in commodity prices which have fuelled record growth rates in the developing world, a slowdown in the rate of remittances could have just as telling an impact.</p> <p>It could also throw up challenges to the tenuous peace in countries like Zimbabwe and Somalia where the collapse of the state means that remittances are the sole source of survival for millions and the motor for the last remaining vestiges of private sector.</p> <p>Yet this crisis could also offer an opportunity for African governments to make better use of the millions of their best-educated citizens who have emigrated to the west.</p> <p>Legislation to allow dual citizenship \u2013 lacking in many sub-Saharan countries \u2013 would mean those in the diaspora who often take up the citizenship of their host states could invest with far greater confidence in their homeland. Specific banking packages to reduce the cost of sending money back home would also be a help. Expanding the mobile phone money transfer service pioneered by the Kenyan company Safaricom would greatly expand the capacity of the millions of unbanked citizens to receive remittances.</p> <p>Perhaps the most important opportunity this crisis offers is a chance for African nations to acknowledge the existence of the vast, untapped potential in the remittances industry. Despite its contribution to economic growth, few governments actually acknowledge, much less court, the diaspora dollars as an important source of economic growth. But as aid slows down as an inevitable consequence of troubles in richer states, governments on the continent will have to change their predominant view of their citizens abroad as potential troublemakers at home because of their superior exposure, to the powerful agents of economic development that they are.</p>",
  "<p>The Bank of England's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/interactive/2008/jul/22/monetarypolicy\">monetary policy committee</a> voted unanimously in favour of the unprecedented, emergency half-point <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/interestrates\">interest rate</a> cut earlier this month as the financial system teetered on the brink of collapse.</p> <p>Minutes of the October 8 meeting showed that the Bank's governor, Mervyn King, and the other eight committee members all agreed that 50 basis points should be lopped off rates as part of a coordinated cut by central banks around the world, including the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. The cut took UK rates down to 4.5%.</p> <p>The MPC said that the financial market turmoil and gloomy economic data over the month pointed to a severe downturn in the British economy and had shifted the risks to the inflation outlook to the downside.</p> <p>The minutes said: \"Given the global nature of the financial market turbulence, there was a strong argument for participating in the proposed coordinated international action.\" </p> <p>Analysts believe that more cuts will be made next month with some predicting that rates will be slashed to 2% by next year.</p> <p>Philip Shaw at Investec said: \"It's not at all surprising that the vote to cut rates by 50 basis points was unanimous. The committee is talking about the evidence being clearly sufficient to justify a half point which hints that another fall in rates seems likely in November - particularly given the continued run of bad economic news.\"</p> <p>In a speech last night, King admitted for the first time that the UK was entering its first recession since the early 1990s.</p> <p>\"The combination of a squeeze on real take-home pay and a decline in the availability of credit poses the risk of a sharp and prolonged slowdown in domestic demand. Indeed, it now seems likely that the UK economy is entering a recession,\" he said.</p> <p>\"It is surely probable that the drama of the banking crisis, which is unprecedented in the lifetime of almost all of us, will damage business and consumer confidence more generally.\"</p> <p>Howard Archer at consultants Global Insight said: \"Last night's speech by Mervyn King's indicated that further interest rate cuts are on the way.</p> <p>\"We expect the Bank of England to cut interest rates from 4.50% to 4.00% in November and to bring them down to 2.50% or even lower in 2009. We expect the economy to contract for four successive quarters through to mid-2009 before stabilizing. Subsequent recovery is then likely to be only very gradual. As a result, we see GDP contracting by 1.1% in 2009 and then growing by just 1.0% in 2010.\"</p>",
  "<p>Mervyn King's talk of recession last night, news today that the Bank of England voted 9-0 in favour of a 50 basis point interest rate cut as part of co-ordinated global action - all this points to one thing, as far as investors are concerned. And that is another rate reduction when the Bank next meets early in November - if not before.</p> <p>James Knightley of ING Bank summed it up:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We continue to look for further aggressive moves in coming months as the activity numbers weaken and inflation starts to fall sharply (the petrol price war is a clear help here). Our base case is currently that the policy rate will be cut to 2.75% in the first half of 2009, but the risks are skewed to the downside given we look for four consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Housebuilders have been lifted by the hope that cheaper money will get the moribund housing market going again. It may be a forlorn hope, but it was enough to push <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/barrattdevelopments\">Barratt Developments</a></strong> 5.5p higher to 67.75p and <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/redrow\">Redrow</a></strong> up 10.75p to 165.75p.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/taylorwimpey\">Taylor Wimpey</a></strong> is 1p higher at 13.25p after analyst Robin Hardy at KBC Peel Hunt moved from hold to sell. In a note today, he effectively argued that the company was in such bad shape that - ironically - it could not be allowed to fail.</p> <p>He said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"There is fear that Taylor Wimpey is pushed into administration \u2013 effectively it's already there. It is being run for the benefit of and in the interests of creditors and not shareholders. So if we are already there, is there nothing left to fear? Sadly not and there is still the risk that the business may be pushed for repayment of bonds and be unable to draw down the money and thus wound up.</p> <p>\"But what happens in a winding up? The big concern is the pension fund. We know the shortfall on the defined benefit scheme is \u00a3377m under IAS 19 but if the business ceases to be a going concern the pension scheme may have to be bought out by an insurance policy to transfer benefits to a money purchase basis. On the last balance sheet estimate this would cost \u00a31.2bn, and today perhaps this is closer to \u00a31.4bn. It could be that the pension scheme payment in the event of winding up assumes a position as senior creditor causing debt holders and all others to line up behind it to share the spoils. If this sum does rise to the surface, will there be enough resources left to pay all other creditors back? </p> <p>\"The creditor queue might look like this:</p> <p>Working capital @ 50% discount sold off in distress = \u00a32,700m<br>Less<br>Pension fund = \u00a31,400m<br>Secured land creditors = \u00a3500m<br>Leaving<br>Spoils = \u00a3800m</p> <p>\"The spoils need to be shared between the lenders at \u00a31,700m and other creditors at \u00a31,300m. There is clearly not enough to go around. If the group remains a going concern there should be an extra \u00a31,000m to be shared out due to a smaller call from the pension and the working capital could be traded out for at least \u00a31,000m more. Therefore, \u00a32,800m a figure much closer to the \u00a33,000m creditors are owed. </p> <p>\"So, it may be the very toxic effect of pushing too hard that brings to lenders to a point of throwing a lifeline to the company as a managed trade out gets them a better chance of recouping. In either scenario equity value is still at risk and the shares may be worthless but in managed trade out there may be value left for shareholders. This close to a price of 10p the shares are simply option money or a like a wager on a horse but pragmatically probably a 5 to 1 bet on a favourable result.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/dsginternational\">DSG International</a></strong>, the electrical retailer formerly known as Dixons, is down 2.5p to 23.25p ahead of a trading update due tomorrow.</p> <p>Morgan Stanley has cut its price target on the company from 90p to 60p but kept its overweight rating. The bank said: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"We maintain our out-of-consensus overweight rating as we see very little downside from the current price unless the company is forced to seek bankruptcy protection \u2014 a possibility that the CDS suggests is relatively unlikely.</p> <p>\"The upside, however, could be very substantial indeed. We still believe that DSG could be worth as much as 180p in a bull case scenario (but as macro-economic conditions deteriorate we think the probability of this outcome is falling). We think investors in DSG (long or short) are likely to need nerves of steel \u2014 in the last five months the shares have halved, doubled and then halved again \u2014 we expect the stock to remain the most volatile in our coverage universe for now.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Nick Bubb at Pali International is less positive, with a sell rating an 22p price target. In the wake of the poor trading update today from Argos owner <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/homeretailgroup\">Home Retail Group</a>, he said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The weak sales at Argos do not augur well for tomorrow's DSG trading update. Argos still claims to be improving its market share in electricals, despite the TV price-cutting by Currys and indeed it has started to sell PCs and laptops this autumn. We have pencilled in a 7% like for like sales fall at DSG in the last 8 weeks, but we now fear that it will be even worse than that, leading to even more forecast cuts.\"</p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>Ever since you first saw her, you've had a little crush on Sarah Silverman, the Jewish-American comedian known for her taboo-busting gags, whom Rolling Stone called \"the funniest woman alive\".

And if your style of reportage runs more to the poetic, you could borrow from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/oct/21/comedy-sarah-silverman\">Brian Logan of the Guardian</a>, who opined that \"the best jokes are as elegant as haikus, and spring-loaded with subversion\". </p> <p>But Silverman's appeal isn't limited to susceptible male critics. <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre/reviews/sarah-silverman-hammersmith-apollo-london-967006.html\">Susie Rushton of the Independent</a> found herself giggling at Silverman's way of saying the word \"pussy\", which she helpfully describes in such detail as to enable you to do a faithful imitation. She goes on to say: \"It's the kind of puerile humour last heard at the back of double chemistry, but it reduced this former schoolgirl to uncontrollable sniggers.\" (Caution is advised when parroting this quote; it may seem gender-neutral, but there's a sting in the tail.) </p> <p>If, however, these pro-Silverman remarks strike you as mere arse-covering by critics who don't want to diss the girl everyone fancies, you have plenty of opportunities to put the borrowed boot in. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/oct/21/sarah-silverman-uk-debut\">The Guardian's Ed Stafford</a> calls the gig an \"exercise in larceny\", having worked out that - you might pull out a pocket calculator here - her time at the Hammersmith Apollo clocked in at more than \u00a31 a minute. (Many readers who had gone to the gig took Stafford's blog as an opportunity to vent their rage, making it a rich source of invective.

Numerous other musicals, from Elegies for Angels, Punks and Raging Queens (a song cycle inspired by the Aids Memorial Quilt, premiered in 1989 in New York and later seen briefly in the West End in 1993) and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2007/oct/16/theatre4\">Rent</a> (first produced in 1996, and whose Broadway run only finally ended in September after 12 years) to Boy George's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2002/may/23/theatre.artsfeatures\">Taboo</a> (premiered in London in 2002), have put HIV characters, both straight and gay, centre stage.</p> <p>So Elton isn't quite as hip as he thinks. Far more radical is the idea of bringing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/jan/13/theatre1\">La Cage Aux Folles</a> back to the West End, as it is being right now. This musical - whose 1986 London premiere was widely thought to have been derailed by public fears of the then-emerging Aids crisis \u2013 offered, long before the current era of civil partnerships, a simultaneously affirmative and defiant portrait of a gay marriage as valid as a straight one, especially when it comes to the responsibilities of child-raising.</p> <p>But if espousing conventionality is still a radical step, there are no taboos left in musicals anymore. You might think that the most radical thing about Elton writing an original screen musical may be the writing of one at all. But the imminent arrival of the latest in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/126069/high.school.musical.3\">High School Musical</a> franchise reminds us that he's not even breaking new ground in that respect.</p>",

  "<p>Let's put Yachtgate and tiffs within the Bullingdon Club aside for now and talk about something trivial for a spot of light relief: global recession and the recasting of the world's economic and political hierarchy.</p> <p>Overnight Mervyn King, ultra-cautious governor of the Bank of England, conceded that it \"now seems likely\" Britain is entering a recession. Or to put it in under-nuanced John Humphrys-speak: \"It's official; we are in recession now. You can't argue with the governor of the Bank of England,\" declared the country's most argumentative man.</p> <p>That's not all. We also learned this morning that India has launched a satellite on a moon mission, another chastening reminder in the year of the Beijing Olympics that the world order is changing. </p> <p>Yes, I know that the west overestimated the significance of the Soviet Union's launch of its pioneering Sputnik satellite. Most oldies can remember hearing that distinctive signal\u2026 \"bleep, bleep, bleep\" and wondering what it meant. </p> <p>All sorts of leftwingers who should have known better by 1957 joined in smug triumph-of-central-economic-planning rejoicing: even clever Denis Healey was reluctant to drop this one. Some things are best done by the state, space rockets, being one, bank rescues another. Most things aren't.</p> <p>A confident America, soon to be personified by JFK, took up the challenge and put a man on the moon by 1969: quite what for, we are still deciding. But Nikita Khruschev's \"we will bury you\" boast proved wide of the mark. </p> <p>Instead, the old USSR, exhausted by its Hitler war (so were we), was actually edging towards collapse, though it took 30 years (we are taking longer). China and India learned the right lessons and are developing more managed forms of capitalism than our own over-exuberant model of recent years, currently in receivership.</p> <p>If we want to be really miserable about the decline of the west \u2013 a recurring theme for 150 years - we could note in passing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/22/uselections2008 \">Ewen MacAskill's report in today's Guardian</a> that the respected Pew research centre in the US is saying that America can no longer run an election for which 130 million voters turn up, hoping to exercise that most basic civic right. </p> <p>Inadequate and partisan electoral rolls, voter challenges, electronic but unreliable ballot boxes (remember those hanging Florida chads), all seem likely to contribute to potential mayhem on November 4-5. Just to complicate what should be a simple on-the-day act Americans are already being allowed to vote - have been for weeks regardless of the fast-changing political picture, which may change their decision.</p> <p>Dumb or what? Soon we will be asking ourselves: \"Did these people really send men to the moon once?\"</p> <p>Never mind, we have more urgent worries. Governor King's concern for inflationary pressures and for \"moral hazard\" (let the errant banks go bust) made him slow to acknowledge the enormity of the crisis. During a speech in Leeds last night he conceded that the system was closer to collapse than at any time since \u2013 wait for it \u2013 not 1929-31, but 1918.</p> <p>The Brown/Darling recapitalisation of the banks may have turned that particular corner. But the crisis is feeding through the system. Bankruptcies, corporate and personal (the two guinea word is \"deleveraging\"), will hit jobs in the wider economy. The virtuous cycle of the last 15 years is going into reverse. </p> <p>Oh yes, and global savings are leaving Britain, putting pressure on sterling. Off 6% overnight, it now trades around $1.63, compared with almost $2 when I was in the US in July. </p> <p>That will feed into inflation and hurt our over-lax trade imbalance, though \u2013 in theory \u2013 exports will also be cheaper. What exports?</p> <p>There will also be less credit around in our credit-dependent economy, where we have been busy borrowing Asian savings. </p> <p>What can King do? Lower interest rates, which he will belatedly agree to do. What can the government do? Speed up job-boosting public spending, as ministers promise to do, hastily polishing their busts of John Maynard Keynes. Actually, it's harder to do that than it looks: ministries are always underspending their budgets.</p> <p>As I type, expensive economists are disagreeing on the radio about the nature of the coming recession, its depth and length. </p> <p>It will hit the middle class south hardest, but skilled people are easier to re-employ, so it will be shallow, says jolly LSE brain, Lord Desai, a touch airily. One of his ex-pupils politely disagrees: it will be deep and nasty.</p> <p>There's always an upside to the downside, so we would do best to wish the Indians luck with their satellite and the Americans with their election, fasten our seat belts and hope for the best. In recession we may be kinder to each other, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/22/recession-credit-crunch-morrisons-waitrose\">nice John Harris suggests</a> in today's paper: the Morrison spirit!</p> <p>Did someone say that oil prices, now around $70 a barrel, have already fallen by half from their spot price peak a few months ago? Break open that last bottle of Asti Spumante? Not yet. Today's City pages report that Russia, Iran and Qatar, who control 60% of the world's gas deposits, are setting up a cartel. </p> <p>Welcome back Opec.</p>",

I asked Timo Soinen, CEO of development company Sulake, how Habbo became the virtual world's leading social destination for 13-16 year olds, and why gamers should be interested.<br></p> <p><strong>How do you think Habbo managed to become the leading virtual world for teenagers and so successful for so long? </strong><br>Habbo has been operating for eight years, and the user numbers around the world keep growing all the time \u2013 we still have lots of potential audience out there, we have just scratched the surface. </p> <p>Even in the early days of Habbo, one of the main advantages was that it is easy to access and play: you don't need to download any software; you just need an internet browser to log into the virtual world. Habbo is also a constantly evolving product as we bring new features to the service every month, keeping it fresh to our users. In doing this we listen and react to user feedback and do continuous research to understand our users' needs. Still, the most important factor is that Habbo is all about user generated content. It has so many active users who devote time and energy to create compelling content for their friends and other Habbos. After all, Habbo is a place for its users, and they are the ones who make Habbo what it is. </p> <p><strong>64% of British kids who use Habbo report that they have friends they've never met offline according to your Global Youth Survey. This freaks a lot of people out. What do you think has allowed this phenomenon to become possible? </strong><br>The whole concept of friendship has new meanings in the online world - in many social online services, having a lot of friends on your friendlist can be considered to be a cool thing. This can also be witnessed in how adults use Facebook and other social networks. When asked about \"real friends\", teens' answers are usually between 4 and 10. But for online services, the answer can be over a 100, and in these, there most certainly are friends that they have never met in real life. Our mission is to teach our users to safeguard their personal information and learn to be extremely careful when meeting friends from the online world.</p> <p>In general Habbo is about your virtual persona and anonymity. We don't allow our users to share their true identity in the service and encourage them not to do so in other services as well. </p> <p><strong>Why should gamers be interested in Habbo Hotel? </strong><br>This depends on what type of gamers we are talking about. As a virtual world, Habbo is a social open-ended game in itself and as such is suitable for everyone. In the Habbo world there are hundreds or even thousands of activities and quests going on all the time arranged by the users themselves. For people who like to play more traditional games, Habbo offers also a few free multiplayer games created by Sulake: SnowStorm (a virtual snow ball fight) and BattleBall, an easy to use yet in-depth strategy game where groups play against each other. There are also some casual games inside world, such as the one-on-one game WobbleSquabble, and you can also do some tricks jumping from the 100-foot high diving board. </p> <p><strong>What kinds of features are you putting into place that ensures that the content of Habbo grows with the age of the consumers? </strong><br>Habbo is typically a teen oriented virtual world; our core user age group being 13 to 16 year-olds. However, we have older users as well. Most of the content in Habbo is created by the users themselves - our role is to ensure that this content is not inappropriate and that the users follow the Habbo Way, our rules and code of conduct for the service. Our aim is not to appeal to adult users. To put it simply, Sulake offers tools for creativity and content creation and ensures that the environment to use these are as safe as possible. </p> <p><strong>You hold a lot of high-profile pop stars and branded events in Habbo (like Gorillaz' personal appearance a few years ago, etc). What do you say to parents who are concerned with the extended exposure their kids have to these messages? </strong><br>Celebrity visits have always been a really cool way for us to provide interesting content for our users. These are events that usually take place in a certain space inside the virtual world, and no one is ever forced to take part. Of course Habbo offers artists, athletes and other celebs a new and exciting way to meet their fans regardless of location. </p> <p>The way in which different brands and advertisers are part of the Habbo virtual world has always been important to us. First of all, we carefully select which brands are allowed to come to Habbo, ensuring they are a good fit. We don't belive in in-your-face advertising - we want the brands to take part in the community and not just push their commercial messages. </p> <p>Another type of brand/event exposure which is important to us is our cooperation with goodwill and youth organisations - we are working currently with over 30 different partners all over the world including Unicef, Red Cross, United Nations, NSPCC to name just a few. </p> <p><strong>Which other online community applications are you impressed with at the moment? </strong><br>Some industry experts predicted last year that 2008 would be the year of virtual worlds. Looking at the amount of applications that are currently in development you can definitely say that the experts had a point. There are lots of interesting projects on the rise, but it is hard to name any specific ones. Virtual worlds are mostly based on imaginary places, but there is one interesting project called Twinity.com, which is based on realistic 3D replicas of the world's most vibrant metropolises. It is interesting to see how it grows. Another interesting area is going to be user generated virtual spaces and mobile virtual worlds. </p> <p><strong>What are your future plans? </strong><br>Our primary focus for the future is to develop the Habbo virtual world continuously, and to listen to our users' demands in the process. We are also currently working on a few other virtual world projects, but it is too early to disclose any information on those.</p> <p>Check out the other interviews from the <a href=\"http://www.virtualworldsforum.com/\">Virtual Worlds Forum</a> interview series: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/gamesblog/2008/oct/08/games.events\">Gaia Online</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/gamesblog/2008/oct/09/games.events\">Dizzywood</a>.</p>",

  "<p>Our new immigration minister, Phil Woolas, has passed his time in parliament as an unremarkable New Labour apparatchik. Like many former presidents of the National Union of Students his career path doesn't seem to have been unduly held back by principle. But one thing has singled him out and that is a visceral line of rhetoric on race and immigration. The BNP have a big presence in his Oldham constituency and he apparently decided years ago that, while he would contest the BNP electorally, politically it was safer to pander to their views. On one occasion Woolas rushed to <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/minister-calls-for-veilwearing-teaching-assistant-to-be-sacked-420313.html\">condemn a Muslim teacher</a> for wearing a veil (without waiting for the industrial tribunal finding).</p> <p>Now as immigration minister he has adopted a keynote rightwing policy of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/18/immigrationpolicy-immigration\">setting a limit on immigration</a>. This is pernicious. People do not distinguish between asylum seekers, economic migrants, the dependents of people lawfully settled here and even bona fide British citizens (like the writer) who happen to be non-white. And, as Phil Woolas knows perfectly well, he has no power to stop people seeking asylum, which would be in breach of our obligations under the European convention on human rights. There is freedom of movement within the European Union so he cannot stem that flow of economic migrants. And British residents have the right to bring their wives and children in, whatever their colour. So for Woolas to raise expectations that he can somehow cap, or even reverse, the number of immigrants in the country is futile. </p> <p>Worse is the way that Woolas is peddling every rightwing half-truth about immigration. He claims that the government has \"to face up to voters' concerns about the level of immigration\". But the truth is that the government has done little else but pander to white fears on the subject. Since 1997 the government has passed seven separate pieces of legislation on immigration and nationality, all designed to make the system tougher. Woolas claims that it is \"too easy to get into this country\". Tell that to my constituents who wait years to be joined by their partners or dependents. Or explain this to the young children detained for months in detention centres for no other crime than being the offspring of asylum seekers. The truth is that the legislation has never been more draconian, and asylum seekers and would-be migrants have never had fewer rights. If the numbers of migrants continue to rise it is because of the \"pull factor\" of an (up until now) booming but deregulated economy sucking in cheap labour. And there has been a global rise in the millions seeking asylum from war, pestilence and famine. </p> <p>We all know that a recession <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/20/immigration-immigrationpolicy\">leads inexorably</a> to a rise in racism and xenophobia, but a cap on immigration is not the answer.</p>",
  "<p>Miners are in the spotlight as recession fears continue to grip the market, and metal prices continue to fall.</p> <p>Overnight <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/bhpbilliton\">BHP Billiton</a> </strong>echoed recent comments from rival and bid target <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/riotinto\">Rio Tinto</a></strong>, which warned of a slowdown in Chinese growth. BHP said it had maintained copper output despite a dramatic drop in the metal's price. But it unnerved investors by suggesting demand from China - which has been the powerhouse behind much of the previous global economic growth - was set to weaken.</p> <p>This sent BHP shares down 69.5p to 897.5p. Rio meanwhile lost 107p to \u00a324.53 despite an earlier rise on hopes that BHP would sweeten its all share bid by adding some cash to the offer. There was even talk of a Chinese counter-bid - the country's aluminium producer joined forces with Alcoa in February to buy 12% of Rio.</p> <p>With copper down 5% to a three year low and other metals also in decline, the miners are among the main losers in the FTSE 100. <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/vedantaresources\">Vedanta Resources</a></strong> has lost 60p to 653p, <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/kazakhmys\">Kazakhmys</a></strong> is 24.25p lower at 280.75p and <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/xstrata\">Xstrata</a></strong> has fallen 82p to 989p.</p> <p>All this has pushed the leading index 63.66 points lower at 4166.07. Of course, Bank of England governor Mervyn King saying last night that the country is in recession has not helped matters.</p> <p>Chris Hossain at spread better ODL Securities said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Whilst [King's assessment] isn't surprising news, such strong sentiment has clearly spooked investors. Following a couple of strong sessions, we are once again facing up to the prospect of the recent rally possibly being a false dawn. One gets the feeling that every time we see a light at the end of tunnel, such as libor [the rate at which banks lend to each other] dropping, we are faced with another issue. It's possibly na\u00efve to think we are out of the woods just yet, but it will be interesting to see if investors use today's falls to buy in to weakness, or exacerbate the problem by further selling.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>More signs that the downturn is well underway came from <strong>Home Retail Group</strong>, down 4.75p to 189.25p after the Argos and Homebase owner warned full year profits were likely to be at the lower end of expectation unless trading conditions improved. Underlying half year profits were down from \u00a3149.8m a year ago to \u00a3121m, and it wrote down the value of Homebase by \u00a3542m. Rival <strong>Kingfisher</strong>, the group behind the B&amp;Q business, fell 2.9p to 110p.</p> <p>Banks are again turning in a mixed performance, with the unwinding of the Lehman Brothers credit default swaps contracts - a form of insurance on companies defaulting on their debt - hitting sentiment. The trouble is no one knows how big this problem is, with some worried that banks and insurers might have to pay out around $350bn, but others suggesting most of the losses had already been absorbed. The full picture may not be clear until banks start reporting their next set of results.</p> <p>So <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/barclay\">Barclays</a></strong> is down 3.5p at 239p and <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/royalbankofscotlandgroup\">Royal Bank of Scotland</a></strong> has lost 5.4p to 73.9p.</p> <p>But <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/hsbcholdings\">HSBC</a></strong> is 17p higher at 827p and <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/standardchartered\">Standard Chartered</a></strong> is 7p better at \u00a310.44 after Collins Stewart pointed out the benefits to the two banks of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/oct/22/pound-recession-interest-rates\">continuing strength of the dollar against sterling.</a></p> <p>Analyst Alex Potter said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"HSBC generates around 70% of its earnings in US dollars or currencies linked thereto. We feel this may be 5-10% higher at Standard Chartered. So both of these banks are obviously benefited but we prefer HSBC on greater capital strength, less gearing to South Korea and less gearings to Hong Kong and its extended property market. Both of these banks are also very useful methods for onshore UK mandated funds to defray the economic risks associated with Sterling in current markets.\"</p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>Female adults may have a problem breaking through the glass ceiling to achieve their full potential. (Let's hope that if she becomes vice-president of the United States, Sarah Palin will provide an encouraging role model for them.)</p> <p>But when it comes to children, the genders are reversed. Girls are outperforming boys by such a consistent and significant margin that educationalists are starting to take the problem seriously. For British as well as American boys, Bart Simpson's catchphrase \"Underachiever and proud of it\" is uncomfortably close.</p> <p>Two Labour-run councils, Newham and Tower Hamlets, have gone so far as to introduce a policy of positive discrimination in a <a href=\" http://www.24dash.com/news/Communities/2008-10-13-Free-primary-teaching-seminar-to-recruit-male-graduates \">joint initiative</a> to try and persuade more men to become primary school teachers. <br>They are:</p> <blockquote> <p> Offering a free, three-day taster course starting on Tuesday, November 18.<br>The course is designed to provide information and advice about a career in education and will include a range of topics from the national curriculum to behaviour management, as well as routes into teaching and practical considerations such as training, pay, loans and finances.</p> <p>This course is specially designed for male graduates who live in Newham or Tower Hamlets and are considering a career in teaching.</p> </blockquote> <p>Women need not apply. But there has not been a squeak out of the radical feminists \u2013 for all their talk in the past about how the cure for macho behaviour was for boys to be taught by women.</p> <p>Diane Abbott, the Labour MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, initiated a <a href=\"http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.com/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080625/halltext/80625h0006.htm\">parliamentary debate</a> on the subject in June, where she was forthright that securing more male teachers was key:</p> <blockquote> <p>I wish specifically to address black male under-achievement, many of the issues that I shall raise are relevant to white working-class boys of any ethnicity. What image of the world will they have if they live on an estate and in an environment where they never see working males fulfilling their responsibilities? In school, the only people they see exercising their authority and fulfilling their responsibilities are women. One can meet too many little boys in school who, in a confused way, think that books and education are for girls. What are they to think if 9 out of 10 teachers are women?</p> </blockquote> <p>Aside from \"working class\" being a euphemism for those not working but on welfare, her analysis makes sense. She had been well aware of the state system letting down black boys and in 2003 announced she was sending her son to a \u00a310,000-a-year private school. At fee-paying schools, black boys tend to do just as well as white girls. That is because fee-paying schools are not plagued by \"the soft bigotry of low expectations\".</p> <p>Nothing will have happened in the last five years to persuade Abbott that she made the wrong choice. Any advance for equality has been of leveling down, as the white boys fall behind too.</p> <p>So, as dear old Lenin used to ask: What is to be done? More male teachers would help but I'm not sure it is key. When I was a pupil at Pimlico School (a comprehensive now called Pimlico Academy) I don't remember any correlation between the gender of the teacher and order in the classroom. The science teachers tended to be men and the boys would wave Bunsen burners around setting fire to bits of paper while the girls got on with their work. <br> More single sex schools might help. So might more sports competitions between schools to engender greater school pride and particularly encourage boys to be more engaged. Boys have probably particularly lost out by changes to the curriculum such as scaling back of British history and the switch to nice, neat feminine coursework rather than testosterone-charged exams. Bland, sanitised PC storybooks add to the perception that reading is for sissies. However, shadow schools minister Nick Gibb focuses on the teaching method for reading. He says:</p> <blockquote> <p>Synthetic phonics closes the gap between boys and girls, between socio-economic groups, and between ethnic minorities and the rest of the population. It works, and it works particularly well for all those groups.</p> </blockquote> <p>But I think that most important of all would be restructuring of the school system to allow a massive expansion of affordable private schools. So that the choice available to Abbott can be for the many and not just the few.</p>",
  "<p>Thirty-five years after it shocked the world by hiking the oil price, has Opec now lost its grip? </p> <p>The cartel is widely expected to cut production at its emergency meeting in Vienna on Friday, in an attempt to prevent the cost of a barrel of oil dropping any further. Yesterday, Iran's oil minister even declared that the era of cheap oil was over.</p> <p>The result? US crude fell over $4 overnight, pushing it below the $70 a barrel mark that <a href=\"http://in.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idINIndia-36033820081018?rpc=401&amp;\">the Opec president has declared as the floor in the current conditions</a>.</p> <p>That $147.27 all-time high set in July feels a long time ago.</p> <p>In more normal times, the threat of Opec throttling energy supplies would send oil futures bounding upwards. But normal times these ain't, and it's becoming clear that the global economy is contracting quicker than the likes of Saudi Arabia can rein in production.</p> <p>Oil experts say that the market has already priced in a one million barrel a day cut, so Opec has to at least match that to avoid sparking another round of selling. Edward Meir, an energy analyst at MF Global, believes that even a 2 million barrel cut would not combat the \" demand vaporization\" as recession looms. Apart from Saudi, who were the only country to bow to political pressure and increase production this summer, it's not clear which other countries will feel able to take the financial hit of cutting supplies. </p> <p>The oil industry is also suffering directly from the financial crisis.</p> <p>Cash-hungry banks are so reluctant to lend that <a href=\"http://www.theoildrum.com/node/4660\">the credit lines that normally lubricate the oil industry have dried up</a>. The result, analysts say, is that the most powerful retailers are able to haggle prices down, as oil producers are wary of selling to someone else who might go bust before paying up.</p> <p>All this explains why UK drivers are seeing some relief at the pumps. With Morrisons announcing a 2p cut in petrol last week, other supermarkets are probably in a good position to follow.</p>",
  "<p>The Chinese love affair with the internet will see digital ad spend increase 40% to $5.2bn (\u00a33.07bn) next year, making the booming Asian online economy roughly the same size as the current UK market, according to a report.</p> <p>The study by KPMG, to be unveiled today at the MediaGuardian Create in China conference in central London, estimates that the total ad spend on all media in the Chinese market will grow by 22% this year and 19.5% next year.</p> <p>By the end of next year, the Chinese ad market will be worth $37.85bn, a year-on-year increase of more than $6bn on 2007.</p> <p>The report, called Destination Digital: Opportunities in China's Media and Advertising Market, argues that UK media companies need to tap into the Asian tiger economy, particularly the digital sector.</p> <p>KPMG estimates that the Chinese digital sector - including ad spend on internet, email ads, in-store LCD screens and mobile - will grow by about 73% this year and 43% next year to be worth $5.2bn (\u00a33.1bn).</p> <p>According to the Internet Advertising Bureau, the UK digital advertising market was worth \u00a32.8bn at the end of last year and will be worth close to \u00a33.5bn for 2008 based on current estimates.</p> <p>However, the scope for growth in China is huge with core internet ad spend - primarily the paid search, online display and classified markets - accounting for 8.5% of total media spend in the country.</p> <p>In the UK, internet ad spend accounts for around 20% of the total media market.</p> <p>\"China has truly emerged as a leading market for digital media including web 2.0 technologies such as social networking, blogging, online gaming and cross-platform services,\" said Honson To, a partner at KPMG China. </p> <p>\"Chinese internet user numbers are higher than anywhere else in the world and so far only 19% of Chinese people are online,\" Honson added.</p> <p>KPMG estimates that there are 100 million bloggers, 601 million mobile phone users, more than 250 million web users - an extra 91 million going online in the last year alone - and 120 million online gamers.</p> <p>Between 2003 and 2007, online ad sales in China grew by more than 60% annually, compared with around 10% growth for newspaper and TV advertising.</p> <p>The report also estimates that Chinese internet users spend 14 times longer online per week than US users.</p> <p>KPMG also forecasts that China's huge TV market - 1.19 billion TV viewers over the age of four and one-third of the global cable TV market, which accounts for more than 60% of the country's media spend - also presents opportunities for western companies.</p> <p>\"Content generation represents a big opportunity. Chinese TV producers are increasingly likely to need to look outside China to secure appropriate content and programme formats for different channels,\" Honson said.</p> <p>KPMG also said that radio in China had staged a comeback in the past 10 years, as more city dwellers buy cars and will grow from zero share of the country's media market in 2004 to 3.5% by the end of next year. </p> <p>The Chinese newspaper sector is growing but, like in foreign markets, China's 2,000 papers are seeing weaker revenue growth. </p> <p>By the end of next year, the sector will account for 9.6% of the Chinese media market, down from a 19.4% share in 2001, according to KMPG.</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.
