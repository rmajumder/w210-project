  "<p>Artificial clouds to reflect away sunlight, creating colossal blooms of oceanic algae, and the global use of synthetic carbon-neutral transport fuels - just three of the climate-transforming technologies in need of urgent investigation, according to leading scientists. The group argues that, with governments failing to grasp the urgent need for measures to combat dangerous climate change, radical - and possibly dangerous - solutions must now be seriously considered.</p> <h2>Air</h2> <p>Some of the most extreme ideas for climate engineering involve reducing the sunlight falling on the Earth's surface. Ken Caldeira of the Carnegie Institution in Stanford calculates that reflecting just 2% of the sun's light from the right places on Earth (mainly the Arctic) would be enough to counteract the warming effect from a doubling of CO2 in the atmosphere.</p> <p>One approach is to insert \"scatterers\" into the stratosphere by deploying jumbo jets to deposit clouds of particles, such as sulphur dioxide. About 1m tonnes of sulphur dioxide a year across 10m sq km (3.8m sq miles) of the atmosphere would be enough to reflect away sufficient amounts of sunlight.</p> <p>Another study proposes building ships that could spray micrometre-sized drops of seawater into the air under stratocumulus clouds to make them whiter. </p> <h2>Ocean</h2> <p>The growth of marine algae and other phytoplankton captures vast quantities of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, but growth is often limited by a lack of essential nutrients. Adding such nutrients, such as iron or nitrates, to stimulate growth was studied by a team led by Richard Lampitt of the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton. The organisms incorporate atmospheric CO2 as they grow and, when they die, sink to the bottom of the ocean, taking the carbon with them. However, there is a moratorium around the world on iron-seeding experiments.</p> <h2>Wild cards</h2> <p>Other ideas considered by scientists, though not in the papers published today, include scrubbing carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere. Klaus Lackner of Columbia University has designed a machine that could, if built to full scale, take up the CO2 emissions of 15,000 cars. With about 250,000 such machines, as much CO2 could be removed from the atmosphere as the world is currently pumping into it. The gas could then be stored underground or used in manufacturing. An idea further into the realms of the fantastic involves using shiny spacecraft to block sunlight. Scientists have suggested a constellation of free-flying craft that would sit between the sun and Earth. The only problem: it would cost around $100bn (\u00a354.9bn) a year.</p>",
  "<p>Tony Elliott is livid. The man who founded London listings magazine Time Out four decades ago is a long-time supporter of the BBC - but he now finds himself at war with a corporation he believes has stepped well beyond its boundaries with the \u00a375m acquisition of the rival travel guide publisher Lonely Planet. It's a fight that broke out spectacularly at last week's Edinburgh TV festival, where Elliott called publicly for the broadcaster's commercial arm BBC Worldwide to be broken up and sold, and he now intends to take his argument direct to parliament, as a committee of MPs prepares to scrutinise a deal that has infuriated the publishing industry.</p> <p>\"The Lonely Planet thing has clearly triggered a lot of people thinking 'What the fuck is going on at BBC Worldwide?' and they have started asking questions,\" says the 61-year-old publisher, seated in his office at the heart of Time Out's headquarters on Tottenham Court Road.</p> <p>Elliott, who has something of the ageing hipster about him, not least because of the flowery shirt he is wearing, is at the centre of a growing band of lobbyists who think BBC Worldwide is out of control - threatening to use the massive marketing and brand muscle the BBC has built up with licence fee money to pulverise commercial companies that operate in sectors far removed from the corporation's core business of TV and radio.</p> <p>\"I think the BBC is fantastic,\" he says. \"But I think that BBC Worldwide should be broken up. I think that things that they do which are a logical extension of the broadcasting side - selling the programmes or formats - should continue to exist and be part of the BBC, but all the other stuff should be sold off. My gut feeling is that may well end up having to happen.\"</p> <p>The catalyst, he hopes, will be the upcoming investigation into the BBC's commercial operations by the culture, media and sport select committee. Elliott, a compulsive hoarder who within seconds can put his hands on Time Out's forerunner, an arts magazine he edited at Keele University in the 1960s, is already preparing his extensive submission to put before MPs. \"I cannot believe that these people are going to say to the BBC 'just carry on',\" he says. Alongside Time Out will be Penguin, owner of the Rough Guide franchise, which has already tried - in vain - to get the BBC Trust to explain why it approved the deal last October as fitting with the BBC's public purpose.</p> <p>Some within the BBC privately believe Elliott's anger is due to the fact that he had been in on-off talks for several years about making Time Out's listings available to the corporation. Elliott admits that he always felt the BBC would be a \"perfect partner\" for the magazine he famously started on a kitchen table in his mother's house in Gloucester Road with \u00a370 from his aunt, but \"BBC Worldwide were not really prepared to entertain, let's call it a joint venture, of any description\".</p> <p>\"Really what they wanted, in the two or three times we talked about it seriously, was to own the business and I was not interested in selling the business. We just never got anywhere and then they went off and bought Lonely Planet, which pissed us off to say the least.\"</p> <p>After 40 years in the publishing business, during which Time Out has expanded from a London-based listings magazine to a global empire with 23 magazines in 16 countries and more than 40 regularly updated city guides, parallels with current events come easily to mind for Elliott: \"Elements of this feel very similar to the TV listings thing, there are clearly aspects of this that do not feel right. Somebody, ie the government, needs to take a view on this.\"</p> <p>That \"TV listings thing\" was a near decade-long battle against the duopoly over programme information held by the Radio Times and TV Times, which was eventually ended by the then Tory government in 1991. Time Out set the ball rolling when it published full TV listings to coincide with the launch of Channel 4 in 1982. The magazine ended up being taken to court.</p> <p>That fight came just a year after Elliott faced his own internal dispute as staff mutinied over pay, leading to a vicious strike that halted publication and eventually saw about four-fifths of his staffers, including the Guardian's cartoonist Steve Bell, quit to set up a rival publication, City Limits, with backing from Ken Livingstone and the GLC. The strike still rankles with Elliott: \"It was a tribal split and the reality is that a big group within that group should have left the company two or three years earlier, and fucked off and done their own magazine instead of staying in place and constantly warring about editorial control and direction. It was a bit of a misery.\" </p> <p>This battling Elliott is a far cry from the man described by his ex-wife Janet Street-Porter, who was with him in the mid-1970s. In her book Fall Out she portrays him as rather self-effacing and shy. \"I was a lot shyer then,\" he remembers. \"I have got much better. As you get older you get more confident.\"</p> <p>\"Fights are easy because they are black and white, but having casual conversations with complete strangers about nothing in particular is extremely hard work and I am not very good at that at all. I think that comes from what kind of background you come from.\"</p> <p>Elliott grew up in what he describes as \"one of those very silent non-speaking families\". His relationship with a father who walked out when he was 18 was \"terrible\" and it was the move from being a boarder at Stowe school in Buckinghamshire to Westminster college, where he fell in with a group of older students who were regularly visiting art galleries and clubs, that helped draw him out of himself.</p> <p>\"I went immediately from Stowe which was a very rigid, conventional, traditional in a way, public school, into an environment that was like being at university, and hooked up with a bunch of people from London who were sophisticated and it completely changed my life.\"</p> <p>He went to Keele University to study French and history, and worked on the student magazine Unit. On becoming editor in 1967 he decided to break it out of its parochial roots, print more copies and start selling in London's underground hangouts. The magazine included interviews with Jimi Hendrix, Yoko Ono and film director Joseph Losey as well as artist Keith Albarn, father of Blur frontman Damon Albarn.</p> <p>Rather than complete his degree, Elliott returned to London in 1968 with plans to produce a magazine. Before the first issue hit newsstands on August 12 1968, he had toyed with the idea of making it free. Forty years on that idea is back. As the internet draws more traffic, Time Out is looking at slimming down as a magazine and putting its listings info on the web. With nearly 2 million unique users per month for its UK site and twice that across all its properties, it already has a sizeable readership.</p> <p>\"We are in quite an intensive period of thinking and researching to re-plan for the future. The issue is, if you have got a situation in two to three years where the comprehensive role that we play is online, the question is what shape does the print magazine take? Do we have a smaller magazine that is cheaper? Also we have to look at the free route. I am not sure, but there are people in the building who say 'maybe we should look at free'. There is an audience out there, younger people, who because of online do not expect to pay for things. The downside is that advertisers in general do not like free.\"</p> <p>Transformation in any form is going to cost money - and in the current advertising downturn Time Out is already cutting costs. So Elliott is looking for some funding, not least because he would like to buy out the investors in Time Out New York who have been there since 1995. The trouble is, everyone who has approached him over the past few years - such as private equity players - have wanted control, with a firm timetable to a full exit, probably through a flotation. Elliott has radically different ideas.</p> <p>\"It is absolutely true that every aspect of the business would benefit from having more working capital and it would make sense to widen the ownership of the business,\" he admits. \"But in a perfect world I would like this business to remain independent long, long, long term.\"</p> <p>Achieving that ambition may prove to be his hardest battle yet.</p> <p><strong>Curriculum vitae </strong><br><strong>Age</strong> 61<br><strong>Education</strong> Stowe School, Buckinghamshire; Westminster college, London; Keele University (French and history)<br><strong>Career</strong><br><strong>1968 </strong>Started Time Out from his mother's kitchen in Gloucester Road, London.

  "<p>Some of London's largest hospital trusts are drawing up claims for compensation relating to the disastrous performance of computer systems installed by BT under the government's controversial \u00a312.7bn overhaul of NHS IT systems in England.</p> <p>Board minutes from the Royal Free Hampstead NHS Trust show members discussing who is to blame for shortcomings in a patient administration system, additional spending required to cope with the crisis, and the possibility of legal action.</p> <p>Minutes dated August 28, seen by the Guardian and Computer Weekly, describe trust chief executive Andrew Way outlining his view of who is to blame. \"With regard to compensation, Mr Way reminded members that the contract was with the Secretary of State and that currently it was considered the NHS as a whole was failing to deliver more substantially than BT.\"</p> <p>The papers show the board also noted one other trust - not named - was known to be seeking compensation. The Royal Free board has instructed staff to log \"all problems ... encountered to be used in the event that a claim proves possible\".</p> <p>In 2003 BT Global Services won a \u00a3993m 10-year contract to build a care records service throughout the NHS in London. BT has given no indication its London NHS contract is under pressure. But two out of its three fellow NHS IT contractors in other regions in England - Fujitsu and Accenture - have withdrawn from similar contracts. </p> <p>Work on the BT London contract has been mired in difficulties, particularly around administration systems produced by US software sub-contractor Cerner.</p> <p>Cerner's system has been installed by BT in four London acute trusts. In each case, trust board minutes detail a litany of glitches, bugs and system failures. The latest minutes from Barts record: \"Clinics were reduced in some areas and issues with bookings meant that some clinics and operating theatres were not operating at their usual capacity.\" </p> <p>Hospitals earn income from primary care trusts for the patients they treat, so reduced activity is expected to hit Barts' income. As a result of \"data quality issues\" from BT's implementation of Cerner systems, Barts is forecasting \"an under-performance of \u00a33m for the year\".</p> <p>At Barnet 14,000 patients contacted the trust with concerns about their treatment compared with 5,500 in 2006.</p> <p>A spokesman for NHS London said: \"As you would expect with such a major system being implemented in large and complex organisations, there have been some difficulties in the early stages. However, these have eased as staff have got used to the new system . Patients and staff are now seeing the benefit of a more efficient IT system and we expect the improvements to continue as the system rolls out.\"</p> <p>BT said: \"There are no trusts which are making claims against BT. The issues that have been reported are bedding-down issues.\"</p>",
  "<p>Fabio Capello handed a delighted Jimmy Bullard an unexpected first call-up to the England squad last night but the national coach waived the opportunity to recall Michael Owen, recovered from injury at Newcastle United, for the first competitive games of his reign against Andorra and Croatia.</p> <p>The Italian watched Owen play in Saturday's 3-0 defeat at Arsenal and was clearly unimpressed with the 28-year-old's fitness. The country's most experienced and prolific forward of recent times was starved of service as his team were overrun at the Emirates. Instead, Capello has opted for only three recognised strikers in his squad: Jermain Defoe, Emile Heskey and Wayne Rooney, with the trio boasting only 24 international goals from 119 caps between them.</p> <p>Yet Owen's omission was overshadowed by the surprise selection of Bullard, a player whose future at Fulham has been cast into doubt in recent weeks, with Bolton Wanderers apparently keen to lure him to the Reebok. </p> <p>\"I'm absolutely over the moon,\" Bullard said last night, \"just delighted. I'm so excited, but I just want to go and meet up with the guys now and do whatever the manager asks of me.\"</p> <p>Bullard suffered a dislocated knee and ruptured cruciate ligaments in September 2006 and was sidelined for 15 months but recovered form and fitness to play a key role in Fulham's successful fight against relegation from the Premier League last season. He currently has two years to run on his contract. Although talks over a new deal are not considered to be at an impasse, the Fulham manager, Roy Hodgson, has effectively put renegotiations with existing players on hold. </p> <p>The 29-year-old midfielder, who started his career at Gravesend and Northfleet and once went on a free transfer from West Ham to Peterborough United, has been included after Steven Gerrard, Owen Hargreaves and Michael Carrick were all forced out of contention through injury. </p> <p>The West Ham goalkeeper Robert Green, who saved Jason Robert's penalty against Blackburn on Saturday, is recalled along with the Everton defender Joleon Lescott, with the latter preferred to Jonathan Woodgate.</p> <p>But there are concerns over the strikeforce selected. Owen boasts 40 goals in 89 England appearances but has played only 45 minutes under Capello. Despite scoring on his two previous substitute appearances this season, he joined Portsmouth's Peter Crouch and Dean Ashton of West Ham in being ignored. The Italian appears to consider Theo Walcott as his fourth striker, though the Arsenal player usually features on the flank at club level.</p>",
  "<p>Alistair Darling's interview on the economic slowdown is a major political crisis ... but only because a beleaguered government, bizarrely, has decided that it should be. He said nothing that wasn't, frankly, bleeding obvious, including that voters are \"pissed off\" with Labour. Almost all the commentators and rival politicians who now profess themselves appalled at his \"gaffe\" have been saying just the same for weeks, if not months.</p> <p>The economic outlook is terrible. For ministers to pretend it isn't drives voters mad. We can see what's happening to house prices and to unemployment. Most people reading this column, I would guess, know others whose businesses are struggling, or who've lost their jobs, or are desperately overborrowed, even if they themselves are not in those dire straits yet. As to the blame game - was it Gordon Brown's stewardship of the economy, or world conditions? Darling was completely on message in saying that it's the world economy that is in trouble.</p> <p>Nobody can deny that oil and gas prices, food inflation and the unravelling of parts of the financial system, starting in the US, have had a huge impact on the global economy. It's true that the waves have arrived here at a time when the government has borrowed heavily; it's also true that the Tories did not oppose any of that spending and investment when it was announced. They are backwards prophets. They are poets of hindsight.</p> <p>Yet this morning the predictable Tory and Liberal Democrat reaction to Darling is not the problem. The trouble is No 10's reaction. Now one thing is true: the chancellor is abnormally plain-speaking and because of that dislikes wide-ranging interviews. After I did one with him years ago, in which he talked about how he loathed not getting back to Edinburgh to see his children and wondered aloud how long he could stand being in politics, he gave up interviews for years.</p> <p>This time, he was simply being honest again. But for No 10 to order the chancellor to eat his words on TV (though, in fact, he declined to do that - he just pushed them around his plate) is to turn a private disagreement about tactics into a public political crisis. When that's followed up with briefings by Brownite MPs about the need to put someone else into the Treasury in Darling's place, it starts to look as if the government is cracking up.</p> <p>And at just the wrong moment. There are indeed \"robust discussions\" going on between Brown and Darling over this autumn's economic recovery plan. The complicated and somewhat dodgy-sounding nationalised mortgage scheme is not as central as has been suggested. Changes to stamp duty - though that is difficult too - and further housing measures (which may come this week), plus help on fuel bills, are all in play. </p> <p>One can understand Brown's irritation at the timing of Darling's comments but they don't fundamentally differ. They both think the crisis is severe, that it is mostly imported, and that the government must act quickly to help those worst affected. Nor can the prime minister afford to be distracted, because the next month will be decisive for him personally. The plotting against him was subdued over the summer, but it is now springing up as vigorously as before.</p> <p>Ministers tell me there are broadly three groups. First there's the Blairite \"Taliban\" , whose members want to decapitate Brown now. They are the usual suspects and in a minority. David Miliband is being well advised to treat them cautiously. At least one other minister thinks key trade union leaders will tell Brown he has to go within weeks. At the other end are those who admit things are hellish, but who also think toppling the prime minister would be so bloody that Labour would plummet even further in the polls. </p> <p>In the middle, there's the \"one last chance\" group who think Brown deserves a chance to launch his economic recovery plan and make the speech of his life at the conference, before any moves are made. (Tony Blair, I'm told, takes that view.) Right now, these are the people who will probably prevail. So for the next few weeks we will hear much along the lines of what Jack Straw was saying yesterday: there will be no challenge to Gordon ... there is no crisis - all of which should be taken with a pinch or two of the salty stuff.</p> <p>Brown, who has been talking a lot to former Blair advisers, is said to be drafting a speech that will go further than he has ever done before to admit personal failings and explain why he wants to stay in office, even pushing ahead with reforms he used to oppose. We'll see. He is said to be deeply frustrated by his own performance, and ready to listen to people he used to dismiss out of hand.</p> <p>But he needs to be very careful. To humiliate and then sack his chancellor - someone who regards him as a close friend and who has been very loyal to him - would be to invite ministerial meltdown. Darling is very stubborn and at least as proud as Brown. I would be surprised if he agreed to help launch the recovery package without some agreement that he would not then be axed soon after. If he can be treated badly, anyone can be. This is not the way to rally a cabinet.</p> <p>What, meanwhile, of David Miliband, who was making so much of the running at the start of the summer? His moves to challenge Brown were carefully planned and entirely deliberate - the result of buzzing phones among a large group of people in July. His friends are urging him to keep talking frankly about what Labour needs to do to reinvigorate itself, to stay steely and not to blink, while not openly attacking. But he also badly needs to widen his circle of colleagues. He can seem arrogant and doesn't suffer fools gladly. Ministers and MPs ask why they should back someone \"who's never given me the time of day\".</p> <p>September promises to be a turbulent month, at the end of which Brown could have surprised us all by steadying the ship, or he could be on his way out of Downing Street. There is all to play for. But one thing is certain: unless Brown and his ministers are able to act together to articulate an optimistic vision of what comes next, and defend the better Britain that has been created over a decade of growth, they have no chance of recovery at all. Why would anyone vote to spend more time with the undertakers? Brown needs to remember that. And Miliband. And Darling. Who smiles, wins.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:j.ashley@theguardian.com\">j.ashley@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The credit crunch has claimed three more victims: the members of REM, whose just-completed British tour attracted smaller crowds than the American pillars of college rock were used to. In Cardiff, they downsized from a stadium to an arena; at Old Trafford, a large section of unsold seats was cordoned off; and when they hit the stage at Twickenham at sunset on Saturday, they were confronted by a completely empty top tier.</p> <p>But it wasn't only the economy that was to blame. Musically, they've been trading on past glories for much of this decade, and only with the recent release of their lustily rocking 14th album, Accelerate, have they returned to form. So they've been left with what Spinal Tap would term a \"more selective\" fanbase, but here's where their 28 years as a touring outfit is standing them in good stead - empty seats or not, this show was a roaring confluence of sterling songs and recharged batteries. </p> <p>\"I'm not one to sit and spin, because living well is the best revenge,\" warbled Michael Stipe during the opening song, which translated as: I have recovered my mojo - in spades. Jumpy, jerky performances are his trademark, but here he hit new heights of twitchiness, clawing the air and stamping tattoos with sneaker-shod feet. Coupled with his smart-casual blazer and tie, it gave the impression of a hip teacher fighting off fleas. Cowboy-hatted Mike Mills shadowed him around the stage like a pesky younger brother, swinging his bass until Stipe had to sidestep, a routine watched impassively by guitarist Peter Buck. </p> <p>Apart from playing the straight man, Buck's job was to invest the 30-song set with the rockiest sound REM have used in years. He did it so abrasively that even the older tunes - Drive, Orange Crush, the inevitable Losing My Religion - were divested of decades of barnacles. Half a dozen already punkish songs from Accelerate were twice as raw live, with the exception of Man-Sized Wreath, a piece of traipsing mid-tempo generica Stipe dedicated to Martin Luther King. </p> <p>A rock star who believes that with fame should come political engagement, Stipe made clear for whom he'll be voting in November. \"I feel that this year will see a change - getting the Bush administration the fuck out of office and the Obama administration the fuck into office,\" he said, paving the way for a fierce version of Ignoreland. The word \"Bush\" was greeted by the audience with predictable biliousness, but the moment that best stitched together music and social consciousness was 1987's Exhuming McCarthy, which wove quotes from the 1954 McCarthy hearings into the music with an understatement that isn't REM's usual strong point.</p> <p>Ninety minutes in, there was the cockle-warming spectacle of the three musicians gathered round a piano to sing Let Me In, and then a long goodbye with a half-hour encore. If REM had anything to prove, they proved it, and can proceed with their European tour secure in the knowledge they're still the dons of American rock.</p>",
  "<p>Political inaction on global warming has become so dire that nations must now consider extreme technical solutions - such as blocking out the sun - to address catastrophic temperature rises, scientists from around the world warn today.</p> <p>The experts say a reluctance \"at virtually all levels\" to address soaring greenhouse gas emissions means carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are on track to pass 650 parts-per-million (ppm), which could bring an average global temperature rise of 4C. They call for more research on geo-engineering options to cool the Earth, such as dumping massive quantities of iron into oceans to boost plankton growth, and seeding artificial clouds over oceans to reflect sunlight back into space.</p> <p>Writing the introduction to a special collection of scientific papers on the subject, published today by the Royal Society, Brian Launder of the University of Manchester and Michael Thompson of the University of Cambridge say: \"While such geoscale interventions may be risky, the time may well come when they are accepted as less risky than doing nothing.\"</p> <p>They add: \"There is increasingly the sense that governments are failing to come to grips with the urgency of setting in place measures that will assuredly lead to our planet reaching a safe equilibrium.\"</p> <p>Professor Launder, a mechanical engineer, told the Guardian: \"The carbon numbers just don't add up and we need to be looking at other options, namely geo-engineering, to give us time to let the world come to its senses.\" He said it was important to research and develop the technologies so that they could be deployed if necessary. \"At the moment it's almost like talking about how we could stop world war two with an atomic bomb, but we haven't done the research to develop nuclear fission.\"</p> <p>Such geo-engineering options have been talked about for years as a possible last-ditch attempt to control global temperatures, if efforts to constrain emissions fail. Critics argue they are a dangerous distraction from attempts to limit carbon pollution, and that they could have disastrous side-effects. They would also do nothing to prevent ecological damage caused by the growing acidification of the oceans, caused when carbon dioxide dissolves in seawater. Last year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change dismissed geo-engineering as \"largely speculative and unproven and with the risk of unknown side-effects\".</p> <p>Dr Alice Bows of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at the University of Manchester said: \"I'm not a huge fan of messing with the atmosphere in an geo-engineering sense because there could be unpredictable consequences. But there are also a lot of unpredictable consequences of temperature increase. It does appear that we're failing to act [on emissions]. And if we are failing to act, then we have to consider some of the other options.\"</p> <p>In a strongly worded paper with colleague Kevin Anderson in today's special edition of the society's Philosophical Transactions journal, Bows says politicians have significantly underestimated the scale of the climate challenge. They say this year's G8 pledge to cut global emissions 50% by 2050, in an effort to limit global warming to 2C, has no scientific basis and could lead to \"dangerously misguided\" policies.</p> <p>The scientists say global carbon emissions are rising so fast that they would need to peak by 2015 and then decrease by up to 6.5% each year for atmospheric CO2 levels to stabilise at 450ppm, which might limit temperature rise to 2C. Even a goal of 650ppm - way above most government projections - would need world emissions to peak in 2020 and then reduce 3% each year.</p> <p>Globally, a 4C temperature rise would have a catastrophic impact. According to the government's Stern review on the economics of climate change in 2006, between 7 million and 300 million more people would be affected by coastal flooding each year, there would be a 30-50% reduction in water availability in southern Africa and the Mediterranean, agricultural yields would decline 15-35% in Africa and 20-50% of animal and plant species would face extinction.</p> <p>Martin Rees, president of the Royal Society, said: \"It's not clear which of these geo-engineering technologies might work, still less what environmental and social impacts they might have, or whether it could ever be prudent or politically acceptable to adopt any of them. But it is worth devoting effort to clarifying both the feasibility and any potential downsides of the various options. None of these technologies will provide a 'get out of jail free card' and they must not divert attention away from efforts to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.\"</p> <p>Mike Childs of Friends of the Earth said: \"We can't afford to wait for magical geo-engineering solutions to get us out of the hole we have dug ourselves into. The solutions that exist now, such as a large-scale energy efficiency programme and investment in wind, wave and solar power, can do the job if we deploy them at the scale and urgency that is needed.\"</p>",
  "<p>Britain's manufacturing sector is beginning to feel the economic chill from the slowing economy and is turning to the government for help.</p> <p>The sector has enjoyed three years of unbroken growth but though output rose in the past three months, new orders are at a three-year low, margins are being squeezed even harder and more firms are expecting to cut jobs and investment.</p> <p>A joint survey by the EEF and Grant Thornton shows that though output is still holding up, the stagnant British economy and a sharply deteriorating performance from the eurozone is now hitting all sectors of manufacturing industry.</p> <p>The EFF said that given the Bank of England's interest rate dilemma as it faced a combination of a slowing economy and rising prices it was up to the government to take the lead to minimise cuts to jobs and investment.</p> <p>\"Manufacturing has shown considerable resilience in the face of a credit crunch, a global economic slowdown and a massive increase in costs,\" said the EEF's chief economist, Steve Radley. \"But there are now clear signs that these pressures are starting to take their toll on companies.</p> <p>\"The government must avoid adding any further costs to business and put in place policies which will provide the building blocks for an upturn.\"</p> <p>The survey showed that five of the seven main industrial sectors reported weaker activity compared with the previous three months, with basic metals and electrical equipment hardest hit. Electronics and transport were the most positive. </p> <p>Only three regions - the north-west, south-west and Yorkshire and Humberside - reported positive order balances.Bob Hale, head of manufacturing at Grant Thornton, warned that the UK was likely to face hard times over the coming winter.</p> <p>\"UK manufacturing has looked to its export markets for buoyancy this year, but it seems many of the key markets we export to, particularly in Europe, are now coming down with the same malaise afflicting the US and the UK,\" he said.</p> <p>\"However, exporting to emerging markets is still seen as an insulating factor and those UK manufacturers that are able should now be exploring these markets with renewed vigour.</p> <p>\"The majority of manufacturers will now be part of the chorus calling for new government initiatives to support the sector, as any respite will now be welcome in what is likely to be a winter of economic discontent.\"</p>",
  "<p>Meteorologists are predicting a more active hurricane season than usual this year, but there is no way to know whether global warming has caused an individual event such as a hurricane, or whether it has made such storms worse.</p> <p>On the other hand, some scientists argue that severe storms such as Gustav are more likely in a warming world, because warmer seas make more powerful storms. The issue was hotly debated after Hurricane Katrina struck in 2005 and was subsequently featured in former US vice-president Al Gore's film documentary, An Inconvenient Truth. Publicity material for the film showed a hurricane emerging from the chimney of a power station.</p> <p>If anything, the science has become fuzzier in the years after Katrina, with studies suggesting that future storm strength could increase in places but decrease in others - studies seized on by both sides of the debate.</p> <p>Last year's report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said it was \"likely\" that global warming would make future cyclones more intense. Studies of hurricane records suggest that this trend can already be seen. A high-profile paper in 2005 from Kerry Emanuel, professor of meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, showed that tropical cyclones in the west Pacific and Atlantic have become more powerful in the past 50 years. Another study concluded that the frequency of the strongest tropical cyclones has almost doubled globally since the early 1970s.</p> <p>Some scientists have also linked an increasing number of hurricanes in the north Atlantic to global warming. Although, globally the number of tropical storms each year has hovered around 90 over the past century, in the north Atlantic there has been a clear increase. From 1850-1990, the overall average number of tropical storms in the north Atlantic was about 10, including about five hurricanes. Since 1995, the 10-year average has risen, with the 1997-2006 average at about 14, including about eight hurricanes. The IPCC report said this was \"more likely than not\" down to global warming. </p> <p>A number of factors prevent more definitive conclusions. It is difficult to use climate models to simulate the conditions that allow a hurricane to form. Although sea surface temperature is important, so are other variables, including the difference between the temperature of the sea and air, as well as the formation of high level winds that stop storms developing.</p> <p>It is also unclear how reliably historical records of hurricane strength can be compared, while storm activity in some regions seems to rise and fall in natural cycles over several decades. In December 2006, an expert group from the World Meteorological Organisation concluded: \"This variability makes detecting any long-term trends in tropical cyclone activity difficult.\" On the issue of whether climate change is influencing tropical cyclones, the group said: \"No firm conclusion can be made at this point\".</p> <p>The number of people killed and injured by hurricanes has risen significantly in recent decades. This is a result of more people living and building in regions prone to extreme weather.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Thursday September 4 2008. We mistakenly said publicity material for An Inconvenient Truth showed a tornado emerging from the chimney of a power station. It didn't; it showed a hurricane and we have corrected this.</p>",
  "<p>Concerns over the destruction of the Brazilian rainforest resurfaced at the weekend after it emerged that deforestation jumped by 64% over the last 12 months, according to official government data.</p> <p>Brazil's National Institute for Space Research this week said that around 3,145 square miles - an area half the size of Wales - were razed between August 2007 and August 2008.</p> <p>With commodity prices hitting recent highs and loggers and soy farmers pushing ever further into the Amazon jungle, satellite images captured by a real-time monitoring system, known in Brazil as Deter, showed that deforestation was once again on the rise after three years on the wane. </p> <p>The figures launched the controversy over how best to preserve the Amazon rainforest onto the front pages of Brazilian newspapers, and triggered a war of words between environmental campaigners and members of the government who claim that their struggle to protect the rainforest is not being given sufficient recognition.</p> <p>\"This is not about luck, it is about work, work, work,\" Brazil's environment minister, Carlos Minc, told reporters. News that total deforestation rose over the entire year came quickly after the announcement of monthly figures showing that month-on-month deforestation had in fact fallen. Government figures show that between May and June this year deforestation fell by 25%. </p> <p>Despite the good news in recent months about the deforestation of the world's largest tropical forest slowing, Minc admitted his country still faced huge challenges in order to stamp out illegal logging and described the levels of destruction as \"alarming\".</p> <p>\"We can't celebrate [the monthly drops] because deforestation is [still] very large. We have to invest everything into sustainable development,\" Minc told the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper.</p> <p>Critics claimed that the annual statistics gave a more accurate picture of the destruction been wrought on the Brazilian jungle. </p> <p>Environmental campaigners fear that Brazil's push to expand its economy and develop the Amazon region is posing increasing threats to Brazil's natural resources. They accuse the government of retreating from its promises to defend the Amazon rainforest, which has been decimated since the 1970s by a mixture of logging, cattle ranching and soy farming. </p> <p>\"The president [Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva] said there would be no steps backwards,\" the former environment minister Marina Silva said in an interview published yesterday in the O Globo newspaper. \"But suddenly there is a conjuncture of things that go against everything that was being done.\"</p>",
  "<p>Thrusting their arms skywards and chanting Orphic hymns, Greek pagans yesterday made a comeback at the Acropolis as they added their voices to protests against the imminent inauguration of the New Acropolis Museum. </p> <p>Ignoring a sudden rainstorm and irate officials, white-clad worshippers gathered before Greece's most sacred site and invoked Athena, the goddess of wisdom, to protect sculptures taken from the temples to the new museum. It was the first time in nearly 2,000 years that pagans had held a religious ceremony on the site. </p> <p>\"Neither the Romans nor the Ottomans or any other occupational force ever took anything from this holy site,\" said Yannis Kontopidis, one of the high priests who officiated over the affair. </p> <p>\"It's scandalous that antiquities of such value, carved in honour of Athena, should be wrested from their natural environment and moved to a new locale.\"</p> <p>Not since Pericles oversaw the construction of the Parthenon had any of its classical artworks been officially removed - until last year, when thousands of items were transferred by crane to the New Acropolis Museum beneath the citadel.</p> <p>The \u00a394m glass and concrete edifice, designed by the Swiss-American architect Bernard Tschumi in collaboration with Greece's Michalis Photiadis, has divided Greeks. </p> <p>Supporters praise its cavernous space and have claimed the building will offer better protection of the antiquities and a superior viewing space for spectators, who previously had to negotiate the confines of a tiny museum atop the hill. </p> <p>Government officials said its opening later this year should end the British Museum's argument that Athens has no place decent enough to house its classical artworks, including the Parthenon sculptures on display in London since Lord Elgin seized them from the temples more than 200 years ago. </p> <p>An Ipsos-Mori poll, conducted before the new museum's inauguration, recently showed that 69% of Britons believed the marbles should be returned to Greece.</p> <p>However, opponents, including architectural purists, have argued that the new museum insults Greece's cultural heritage, it being in the wrong location and far too big in grandeur and scale.</p> <p>Yesterday's ceremony represented a major coup for Greek polytheists whose faith, which is described by the powerful Orthodox church as a \"miserable resuscitation of a degenerate dead religion\", has long been banned in the country that gave birth to the gods of Mount Olympus.</p>",
  "<p>If BBC Worldwide were to be made into a film, its working title would be How to Lose Friends and Alienate People. For no matter where you look in media land, the sense of grievance at Auntie's ambitious commercial arm is almost universal. Independent production companies? Spitting. Publishers? Cross. Newspapers? Big ones are using their political muscle to bad-mouth the BBC's internet ambitions, while small ones fear they may go bust because they can't compete with the might of the corporation.</p> <p>BBC executives argue that it was ever thus - and they do have a point. Yet their talk of conspiracies is a bit like the least popular member of a reality TV show blaming the petty jealousies of his rival for his own failings. Maybe there really is some wisdom in the crowd?</p> <p>This is not to suggest that all the corporate lapdogs howling about the juicy bones being thrown to a BBC division by its parent are right. Worldwide is a success that saves each licence fee payer some \u00a39 a year, according to the Beeb. And, with the licence fee settlement under pressure and the media industry fragmenting, the corporation is wise to exploit its own material to make more money. </p> <p>Yet questions about Worldwide's transparency and scope are surely justified, given that it aims to double profits to at least \u00a3200m by 2012. </p> <p>Most of us don't find it too difficult to understand why the BBC should make money selling Top Gear to America or even Gardeners' World magazines to horticultural fans - but why exactly is it publishing Grazia in India? Or taking a stake in Australian production companies and start-ups over here? Doesn't such a large and powerful publicly-funded competitor distort fledgling markets? There is a case for the BBC to exploit its fantastic brand name abroad, but it cannot do that and at the same time claim that it does not use licence fee money. The brand itself was built from decades of public funding. </p> <p>There are some who will argue that the Guardian - largely because of its position online and with audio content - speaks as a competitor. But that argument could wipe out all debate in the British media. Surely that's not what the corporate arm of a publicly-funded broadcaster would want. </p> <p>BBC executives seemed somewhat taken aback at the level of passion expressed in last week's debate in Edinburgh. Alex Graham accused them of behaving like latterday colonialists and Time Out publisher Tony Elliott, who expands on his position on the facing page, wants the competition authorities to review the BBC's market intervention.</p> <p>David Moody, Worldwide's well-liked strategy director, blamed \"misunderstandings\" over its remit and criticism that was \"long on rhetoric and self-interest and short on fact\".</p> <p>Yet the facts are that last year's \u00a375m purchase of a stake in the travel guide company Lonely Planet - a \"global branding\" business - has raised all sorts of questions about Worldwide's remit, as have the subsequent tiny investments in production companies and publishing joint ventures, which were not answered when the BBC Trust agreed with the purchase last October.</p> <p>Moody says the latter operations are \"de minimis\" but that hardly helps in a discussion about limits in an increasingly converged media landscape.</p> <p>This particular show is being avidly watched by the BBC Trust, which quietly launched its own review of Worldwide's operations in July and is expected to report, perhaps not publicly, by the end of this year, as well as the culture, media and sport select committee. The BBC has many friends in the industry. Let's have a debate before it loses any more.</p>",
  "<p>An autumn offensive by Gordon Brown to revive his premiership with a package of economic measures risks being overshadowed by the leak of a Home Office document which spells out how the downturn will lead to an increase in crime and greater support for extremist political parties.</p> <p>Days after Alistair Darling <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/30/economy.alistairdarling\">warned in Saturday's Guardian</a> that the economic conditions are \"arguably the worst\" in 60 years, the Home Office paper gives an insight into the government's detailed preparations for the downturn.</p> <p>The document, a draft of a letter from Jacqui Smith, the home secretary, to Downing Street, warns that a downturn may lead to:</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> An increase in support for \"far right extremism and racism\";</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> a possible increase in the support for radical Islamist groups from people who experience racism and possible unemployment;</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> an \"upward pressure on acquisitive crime\", property crime, which increases during a downturn;</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> an increase in public hostility to migrants as the job market tightens;</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> a fall in the use of cocaine and less drunken disorder in town centres unless drinks companies respond to the downturn by aggressive price cutting.</p> <p>The leak of the document, which shows the government acknowledges there will be serious social consequences from a downturn, will irritate Downing Street after a difficult weekend. </p> <p>Darling was forced to record an unscheduled television interview on Saturday to calm the atmosphere after his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/30/alistairdarling.economy\">Guardian interview</a> prompted speculation of a rift between the two most senior members of the cabinet. His frank remarks about the state of the economy, contrasting with the prime minister's mild language, prompted Tory claims that the government was \"dysfunctional\".</p> <p>Downing Street and the Treasury insisted there was no tension between Brown and Darling, claiming they were focused on measures to help people struggling with the downturn.</p> <p>The first initiative will be announced tomorrow when the government unveils plans to help millions of less well-off people gain - or at least not lose - a place on the housing ladder. This is likely to include a \"shared equity\" plan in which local authorities and housing associations help borrowers in return for a stake in their homes. Next week ministers will unveil plans to help people with rising fuel bills when the first cabinet of the new season will be held in Birmingham. This is expected to include measures to improve energy efficiency.</p> <p>In a speech to the CBI on Thursday Brown will underline the depth of the global economic problems which demand a global response. \"The credit crunch has shown that while we now have a global economy that is more integrated than ever before, from which no national economy is insulated, we do not have adequate means of managing it other than as nations or regional entities,\" he will say.</p> <p>But Brown will say that Britain is well-placed to weather the downturn: \"In the next 20 years the world economy will double in its size and wealth and we have a great opportunity to win new business, new jobs and prosperity for Britain.\"</p> <p>The Tories are likely to maintain the pressure on the government after the leak of the Home Office document which shows there could be a twin threat from the far right and radical Islamists. It says: \"There is a risk of a downturn increasing the appeal of far right extremism and racism which presents a threat as there is evidence that grievance based on experiencing racism is one of the factors that can lead to people becoming terrorists ... The relationship to radicalisation is complex ... but there is a possibility that [a downturn] will increase the pool of those susceptible to radicalisation.\" But many Labour MPs are saying that Brown will have a clear run until parliament returns in October.</p>",
  "<p>Downing Street and the Treasury were forced to dismiss speculation of a rift between Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling after a Guardian interview by the chancellor prompted claims that the government had become dysfunctional.</p> <p>\"Relations between Gordon and Alistair are absolutely fine,\" said one No 10 source, while Treasury sources were also at pains to make clear there were no tensions.</p> <p>But the upbeat remarks glossed over a tense weekend in which Downing Street reacted with irritation to Darling's claim in his Guardian interview that the world economy is facing \"arguably the worst\" conditions in 60 years. Brown felt Darling had broken the first rule of law for chancellors: never speak in graphic terms. </p> <p>The chancellor's intervention could not have come at a worse time for Brown as he attempts to steady the ship following a rocky summer for the government. The contrast in tone between Darling and Brown, who always speaks cautiously about the economy, was seized on by the Tories even before the Guardian hit the news stands.</p> <p>George Osborne, the shadow chancellor, released a statement at 11.30pm on Friday accusing him of having \"let the cat out of the bag\" about the serious state of the economy. Osborne intensified his attack the following morning when he said that the contrasting language from Brown and Darling showed that the government was \"dysfunctional\".</p> <p>Darling's remarks were also greeted with incredulity by some in the Labour party, with one senior figure telling the Guardian: \"Alistair must be insane. There is no rhyme nor reason why he would want to talk like that. This really does show that we have a cabinet without leadership and which has given up the ghost.\"</p> <p>Brown spoke to Darling on Saturday morning and within hours a clearly chastened looking chancellor was wheeled out before the television cameras to deliver a prepared statement emphasising the government's two key messages: that Britain is suffering from a global economic downturn and that the government will be proposing measures to help people out.</p> <p>The two most senior members of the government were forced into action because they have been around long enough to understand one of the iron rules of British politics: if relations between Nos 10 and 11 deteriorate then the government as a whole has a limited shelf life. </p> <p>That was the lesson from Margaret Thatcher's downfall in 1990, which was triggered by the resignation of her chancellor Nigel Lawson in 1989. Osborne's use of the word dysfunctional was designed to draw a comparison with 1989 and 1990.</p> <p>It may be overblown to draw comparisons between Thatcher's relations with her chancellors and the current occupants of Nos 10 and 11 - Thatcher disagreed fundamentally with Lawson over key government policy on Europe and the poll tax.</p> <p>But while Brown and Darling share a virtually identical political outlook it is an open secret at Westminster that there have been tensions between the two men over the past year, though these have not become terminal. Darling believes he identified serious problems soon after entering the Treasury last year but was unable to win Brown's support for action before it was too late. The strongest example was the abolition of the 10p starting tax rate of tax, introduced by Brown in his last budget as chancellor last year.</p> <p>Darling pressed for early action on the grounds that it would hit the less well off. Brown said there was not a problem, a position he held to until Darling eventually borrowed \u00a32.7bn to solve the problem in May. It was against this background that Darling changed his operation earlier this year. He sharpened up his press team by hiring his old friend Catherine MacLeod, the respected former political editor of the Herald, to be his special adviser.</p> <p>The chancellor made clear that he was not attempting to brief against the prime minister. His aim was simply to carve out his own - loyal - identity which would strengthen his, and therefore the government's, position. The new approach explains why Darling agreed to break the rule of a lifetime and conduct an in-depth personal interview with the Guardian. Under the influence of his vivacious and razor sharp wife Maggie - a former Sunday Times investigative journalist who is also an old friend of MacLeod - Darling spent two days at his croft on the Isle of Lewis talking about life and politics to the Guardian's Decca Aitkenhead.</p> <p>Opinions were divided in the Labour party about the wisdom of such an interview. One former minister said: \"I thought Alistair talked very honestly. He is a very straightforward highly regarded member of the cabinet. But he must be feeling under pressure from the economy.\"</p> <p>MPs and ministers who believe that Brown has to stand down if Labour is to have a chance of winning the next election will use the Darling interview to claim that the centre is beginning to crumble. But they will keep their powder dry until after the party conference season. \"Gordon has a clear run until parliament returns in October,\" one senior MP said.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Television</strong><br><strong>Go west, young exec</strong><br>The law of America states a successful British executive will eventually try their luck across the Atlantic. And so it is that BBC fiction controller Jane Tranter is considering a job running BBC Worldwide's productions in Los Angeles.</p> <p>But, to paraphrase Mrs Merton, just what is it that attracts the Brits to the glamorous, sun-soaked lifestyle and big pay packets of the US TV industry?</p> <p>Stories are rife of showrunners and executive producers on big shows such as American Idol earning north of $500,000 (\u00a3274,000) an episode. And with rewards that make Jonathan Ross's wages look like peanuts, it's no wonder British producers are tempted to cross the pond. Management earn less than those behind the camera, but still, US companies pay around double UK salaries. One British executive who worked for a major network was earning more than $1m a year before family commitments forced him back to these shores. </p> <p>US networks pay more because they have a bigger market - they invest around $250m on pilots they expect to shelve. As Tom Gutteridge, the founder of LA and London-based Vine Media, says: \"They also commission faster. And have more resources. When I worked on Paradise Hotel in America, we had 24 edit suites, compared with the two you usually get in the UK.\"</p> <p>Plenty of Brits have made it in the US, such as ex-The Last Resort producer, now HBO Films chief, Colin Callender. And Nigel Lythgoe, former Big Brother producer Conrad Green, ex-Gladiators producer Ken Warwick and former Ant and Dec producer Georgie Hurford-Jones have, between them, overseen American Idol, America's Got Talent, and Dancing with the Stars. </p> <p>But if you make the move, don't brag too much. In the ruthless US market your show can be axed instantly - leaving you shamefaced on the next plane home.</p> <p>Writer Steven Moffat only found out NBC was cancelling the US version of Coupling \"when I read it on the internet\". Michael Grade flopped as an independent TV producer in LA in the early 80s. He admitted: \"I thought I was tough, and by British standards I was, but in LA I was out of my depth.\"</p> <p>But Tranter is renowned for her resilience. Plus she will have the backing of BBC Worldwide. It seems unlikely she will end up agreeing with Moffat's description of working in LA: \"We thought it was not much fun. Frankly, we should get off our knees about America.\"<br><strong>Tara Conlan</strong></p> <p><strong>China</strong><br><strong>Cool commission</strong><br>As the dust settles after the Beijing Olympics and reporters move on, media executives are left looking for business opportunities in the People's Republic of China. ITN On - the multimedia wing of ITN - has signed a deal with the Shanghai Media Group to produce 50% of the content for a new show, Cool Edition, on the country's largest English-language channel. </p> <p>The 10-minute-long, magazine-style show will air at 6.30pm Monday to Friday on ICS, which has a daily reach of 18 million. It is aimed at a young, professional, English-speaking Shanghai elite, and will carry details of - you guessed it - all things \"cool\", from west to east. </p> <p>The International Programme Content Network (IPCN), the 14-month-old independently owned company that brokered the deal, believe this is the largest commission from China for any UK company. </p> <p>ITN On's contribution to Cool Edition will feature fashion, music, sport, celebrities, and \"the five coolest facts of the day\" from the UK, according to Mick Desmond, the chairman of IPCN. A Chinese producer will mix the British broadcast with local content. </p> <p>\"If there is something fantastically cool that has happened in the world that day, that will be reported as well. But there is so much going on both in the UK and China that there will be enough fantastic facts and cool stories each day. It's easy to put together,\" says Desmond.</p> <p>An advert on the IPCN website calls for a presenter for the show who can demonstrate \"trendy, funky, cool, attractive presenting styles\".</p> <p>Doing business in China is not a simple process, and there are plenty of regulatory flashpoints for media hopefuls. A magazine-style show about east/west coolness is safe enough to get past the censors, but, Desmond admits, \"hard news would be a very different proposition\".</p> <p>Nicholas Wheeler, managing director of ITN On, is confident that Shanghai-dwellers are just itching to watch what's going on in Cool Britannia. He believes that the success of the Olympics is evidence that the Chinese are learning English on a large scale and are \"interested in the rest of the world and how it works and what we do\". </p> <p>He also points out that \"Shanghai is a very westernised, urban, groovy sort of place\".</p> <p>So, as long as what's \"cool\" in the UK continues to revolve around celebrities, sport and fashion rather than, say, democratic freedoms, Cool Edition looks set to be a success.<br><strong>Heidi Blake</strong></p> <p><strong>Student press</strong><br><strong>What Bullingdon pic?</strong><br>Politicians are no strangers to old stories from their student days resurfacing - from Bill Clinton not inhaling to Tony Blair's Ugly Rumours - but today's students are acting to expunge any potentially damaging skeletons in their digital closets even before they are famous.</p> <p>As editor of the Oxford Student newspaper last year, I received a call at least once a week from students past and present asking to remove their names from online articles. The calls increased after the photograph of David Cameron and Boris Johnson trussed up in \u00a31,200 tailcoats for the 1987 portrait of the Bullingdon Club turned up. </p> <p>It's unlikely that the young Cameron had considered the fact that membership of this highly elitist club might damage an attempt to rebrand the Conservative party several decades later, but current members of a university that has provided 25 prime ministers obviously are. Last March, news organisations were banned from republishing the 1987 photos.</p> <p>When, during his leadership bid, journalists unearthed an article the Liberal Democrat MP Chris Huhne wrote for Isis magazine condoning the use of hard drugs, Huhne said he didn't remember writing it, although it bears his byline. </p> <p>Last year, one former history student took issue with a gossip page from 2003 that claimed she slept with someone because of her involvement in student politics. Now hoping to progress in a political career, she said: \"I hope to be pretty high profile and this won't look good if I succeed.\"</p> <p>Student misdemeanours can attract a lot of attention, as Ben Tansey, PPE student and ex-president of the Oxford Union knows. Last year, a penchant for drunken naked wrestling landed him in the student papers - and the Daily Mail. \"Last summer I had an internship at a major bank and was reprimanded for my appearance in the press,\" he said.</p> <p>Oxford Gossip, an online forum where people could anonymously post gossip about their peers, was recently forced to delete all content, and shut down last year amid threats of legal action.</p> <p>Perhaps Oxford students are sensible to limit the fallout before it happens. On the other hand, Boris Johnson freely admitted that after the Bullingdon Club photo was taken, \"the party ended up with a number of us crawling on all fours through the hedges of the botanical gardens trying to escape police dogs\". Last time I checked, he was doing fine.<br><strong>Samira Shackle</strong></p>",
  "<h2>Poland</h2> <p>The Polish film poster has a unique place in the world. The circumstances of modern Polish history have conspired to create an environment where the advertising of cultural events was able to dominate the popular visual culture of the post-war period.</p> <p>The annexation of Poland by the Soviet Union, in the aftermath of the second world war and after the brutal period of German occupation, condemned the country to a further period of totalitarian dictatorship. The command economy imposed by the Soviets was unable, or unwilling, to deliver the material surpluses which might have raised living standards and supported the beginnings of consumer culture and advertising. In the event, Polish graphic designers were faced with little option but to work for the state.</p> <h2>Film in Poland</h2> <p>The Polish film industry was able to prosper in spite of these difficult conditions. In addition to its own productions, producers were able to establish collaborations with the industry in Western Europe, especially in France and Italy. At the same time, the country remained open to mainstream films from the west.</p> <p>The nationalised, or state owned, distribution of films allowed Polish film posters to develop in a unique way. The usual considerations of star-billing and genre, imposed by the legalistic classification of assets within the commercial film industry in the west, could be largely ignored.</p> <h2>Posters</h2> <p>The Polish film poster is generally distinguished by an integration of image and text that is unusual within the normal arrangements of film advertising.</p> <p>This integration is characteristic of the modern poster and was facilitated by the development of lithography at the end of the 19th century. The French posters of Toulouse-Lautrec, for example, exemplify the beginnings of this tradition where hand-drawn lettering and image making combine into a single, seamless, semiotic presentation.</p> <p>By the 30s, the increasing mechanisation of the lithographic printing process enabled the development of symbolic typo-photographic elements in poster advertising. The relatively austere formal simplifications implicit within this development were continued, after second world war, in the post-Bauhaus international typographic style of the Swiss modernists. These developments in graphic design transformed the activity into one of technocratic specification and moved poster design away from the artistic production of expressive design.</p> <p>In Poland, the political and economic circumstances of the 40s and 50s encouraged artists to continue working in the beaux-arts tradition of pictorial and artistic lithography. Photographic image making and mechanical reproduction remained little used.</p> <p>It was fortunate that, from the 30s onwards, a generation of Polish artist-designers had been formed within the beaux-arts tradition of poster design. The French school of poster design, that had been dominant before the second world war, influenced these artists.</p> <p>In Poland, the legacies of the war and the political circumstances of the 50s allowed for an expression of a psychologically darker and more complex sensibility. By the 60s, these themes of a subjectivity informed by sexual identity and violence had become mirrored in the narratives of new-wave and independent film making around the world.</p> <h2>Cul de Sac</h2> <p>The poster for Cul de Sac, directed by Roman Polanski in 1966, is by Jan Lenica. Lenica was an important member of the Polish school of graphic design and worked as a cartoonist, animator and poster designer. The cut-out lettering and loose brush-work of his poster perfectly express the claustrophobic intensity of the protagonists' developing relationship. The triangulation between the woman, played by Francoise Dorleac, the intellectual and the man-of-action is expressed through the semiotics of heart, gun and spectacles.</p> <p>Dorleac was the sister of Catherine Deneuve and part of the Anglo-French 60s scene. In contrast to the hedonistic appetites and consumption of the swinging sixties in London, the Polish scene expressed itself though a connection to nihilistic scepticism.</p> <p>Some commentators have understood Polish film posters to be an expression of cultural resistance to Soviet oppression. In fact the posters are much more profound; they represent the mass-entertainment of the cinema as something altogether more complex and tragic.</p>",
  "<p>Two goals from the former Celtic striker Kenny Miller, and one each from Daniel Cousin and Pedro Mendes, eased Rangers past their city rivals in the first Old Firm derby of the season. Rangers ran out 4-2 winners at Parkhead in a characteristically fiery match that also featured two red cards. </p> <p>The Celtic manager Gordon Strachan gave his new signing Shaun Maloney his second Celtic debut, alongside another former English Premier League striker Georgios Samaras. </p> <p>Meanwhile Daniel Cousin was a surprise inclusion up front for Rangers, and it soon proved to be an inspired selection from Walter Smith as Cousin tormented the Celtic back-line early in the first half, particularly when cutting in from the right. The Celtic captain Stephen McManus earned a yellow card for hauling down the Gabon forward in the 15th minute, and Cousin's shirt was still torn from the incident when he beat Mark Wilson for pace on the far right, darted along the byeline and drilled a low shot that beat Artur Boruc at his near post.</p> <p>Rangers' lead lasted only two minutes, however, before the Bosnian centre-back Sa\u0161a Papac failed to deal with a whipped Aiden McGready cross from the left, only succeeding in teeing up Samaras to stab home from six yards. </p> <p>Celtic could have gone ahead early in the second half when Maloney found space in the Rangers box but curled his shot around the outside of Allan McGregor's far post. That set the stage for Miller, who also returned to Glasgow after an unsuccessful spell in England, to score the first goal of his second term at Rangers. Kevin Thomson picked out Miller at the angle of the six-yard box and he showed excellent technique to fire a volley into the ground and across Boruc into the far corner.</p> <p>With Celtic now chasing the game, Rangers began to find more space in midfield and were 3-1 up after 61 minutes when Mendes endeared himself to Rangers fans in his first Old Firm match by thumping an unstoppable drive inches inside Boruc's left post from fully 25 yards. </p> <p>The action was not quite done for the afternoon, however, and there was time enough in the final 15 minutes for two red cards and another couple of goals. Cousin earned a second yellow card for leading with his elbow when jumping for a high ball with McManus, then Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink lashed out at Kirk Broadfoot off the ball to earn a straight red. The Dutchman had been on the pitch for less than four minutes.</p> <p>At 10 against 10, Rangers continued to dominate possession and when Boruc spilled Broadfoot's cross from the right, Miller was on hand to tap the ball into the empty net and wrap up a comfortable victory. Nakamura found a hole in the Rangers wall to slot a free-kick past McGregor in the second minute of injury time, but by then the thousands of empty green seats at Parkhead told the story and sent Rangers to the top of the league.</p>",

Or so it seems to some of us some of the time, and a few of us all the time. </p> <p>Because in these godless times, the frustrated and marginalised seek order in a world of chaos and dare to hope that random acts of violence or intolerable, yet sustained wickedness might be part of some over-arching plan \u2013 so the plan could yet be stopped and the perpetrators brought to justice.<br> Conspiracy theories have never been so popular, reborn in the US with the assassination of John F Kennedy and the following investigation, in which every agency and vestige of the US government cooperated to produce a report more riddled with holes than the dead president's body. Their youthful idol slain, so too would the kids' sparkling optimism be eviscerated when told to go off and die in a south-east Asian war, started on a lie. A traumatised generation of American youth retreated into a paranoid, pot-powered counterculture, fighting all those in authority while obsessively re-examining the past. </p> <p>Nowadays the internet propagates conspiracy theories worldwide instantly \u2013 the monopoly of newspapers and TV has been replaced by a score of different takes on the day's events, with hundreds of images and soundbites and thousands of links to supporting sites and a million disparate voices all declaring their wide-eyed agreement. With so many \"alternative\" explanations to consider, how could there really be any singular \"truths\" that authority could confidently expect us believe? 24/7 news means newspapers and TV are at risk of dumping painstaking objectivity for recycling the latest hysteria-powered suspicion, and conspiracies are now, best of all, profitable \u2013 see the once venerable Daily Express front-paging yet another spin on the death of Princess Di.<br> Has not the encroachment of profit as the over-riding consideration into every facet of our lives has also made for more paranoid people, to suspect ulterior motives at every everyday juncture? We know speed cameras are way better at making money for the police than saving lives. We know it does not cost banks \u00a325 to send an automated letter to tell us we're overdrawn. We know our addiction to oil is now truly killing us, economically and environmentally. And we know corporate executives are clever types \u2013 it is no great leap of faith to assume they may be more pro-active in plotting to stiff people. It is only a small step then to argue that as business types, from private security forces to real estate speculators, made a mint out of the <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/27/hurricanekatrina.usa\">Hurricane Katrina</a> disaster in New Orleans, why not suspect that they wanted, indeed willed, the levees to collapse? Did they actively engineer the wild weather, too? </p> <p>Some theories are truly \"out there\", but then it is useful to tar any criticism of the powers that be or the way things are with that same brush. Calling critical comments or unsavoury revelations \"conspiracy theories\" automatically turns them into the fetid conclusions of the paranoid.</p> <p>Or so some might hope. The first allegations of British complicity in the CIA's extraordinary rendition program, by letting their white kidnap airplanes <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/21/ciarendition.sa&quot;\">land and fuel up</a> at our airports, was simply shrugged off as a \"conspiracy theory\" by the British government. That the charges were borne out by investigations by organisations from Liberty to the European Parliament has led not one official to be rendered culpable.</p> <p>The logic behind many a conspiracy theory runs: the suspect has \"previous\", and as they cannot or will not disprove the allegations, it is safer to assume their guilt. So in 2003, the idea that the forthcoming Iraq war was all about oil \u2013 George W Bush being a ex-oil executive, heading a cabinet of ex-oil executives, running the world's biggest gas-guzzling country and seeking to invade an oil-rich country as global demand soared and supplies peaked \u2013 was just a \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/jan/15/foreignpolicy.k&quot;\">conspiracy theory</a>\", or so said Tony Blair. </p> <p>Unfortunately, the case for invading Iraq was itself quite the boldest conspiracy theory, concerning the threat from Saddam's stockpiles of WMD. Saddam had \"previous\" for mass murder, a history of megalomaniacal duplicity, and his protestations of having destroyed any WMD couldn't be believed \u2013 or better, proved, as you can't prove a negative. We all know the rest. We're still there. </p> <p>Are our leaders then simply conspiracy theorists, trying to seek order out of a chaotic world they can't control, frustrated and fearful of being marginalised by their own incompetence and the murderous, meaningless chaos that surrounds them? Are \"they\" not really just like \"us\"?<br> Robin Tudge is co-author of The Rough Guide to Conspiracy Theories</p>",
  "<p>In these days of near-continuous diagnosis, one hears the term \"autophile\" bandied about a fair bit. The OED, thankfully, has neglected to admit the word to its swelling ranks, but there was \u2013 and perhaps still is \u2013 an \"autophile\" column in the Argus of Brighton, and the Bluetones' third album was called \"Autophile\" after the opening track. The <a href=\"http://www.lyricstime.com/bluetones-autophilia-lyrics.html\">lyrics</a> (\"I love your slinky spoilers / They really speak to me\") inhabit a realm in which subtlety seldom trespasses.</p> <p>As a natural pedant, I am disposed to despair at such profound etymological abuse. But in the case of autophilia, which in theory at least refers to a passion directed not at the motor car but at oneself (sexualised narcissism, in short), things are different. For the car has parked itself so firmly in the multi-storey parking lot that is our sense of identity, that the conditions of loving oneself, and loving one's wheels, amount pretty much to the same thing. Cars, it seems, 'r' us.</p> <p>This commonly enough observed phenomenon is given an unusually thorough treatment in the shape of the publication this week of Traffic, a new book by <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/books/feature/2008/08/27/traffic/index.html\">Tom Vanderbilt</a> subtitled \"Why we drive the way we do (and what it says about us)\". The premise relates to the notion that because driving depersonalises the space around us \u2013 as the narrator of Paul Haggis's Oscar-winning <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375679/\">Crash</a> has it, \"We're always behind this metal and glass. I think we miss that touch so much that we crash into each other, just so we can feel something\" \u2013 the study of our behaviour behind the wheel provides fruitful access to a modified social psychology that is in many ways in danger of becoming the norm. For Vanderbilt, in other words, the motorway is as telling a sociological library as you're likely to find.</p> <p>But Traffic, which is Vanderbilt's third book, is not the kind you'd find in the sociology section of your university library. For one thing, it's well written. For another, it's amusing; at times very much so. So it's not going to start any revolutions \u2013 on the tarmac or in the lecture theatre \u2013 but is more than likely to start some healthy chatter with its anecdotal style and uncommon degree of thoughtful insight into such things as early and late mergers, the 20mph limit on eye contact, why everyone but us is a terrible driver, and the surprising effect on road safety of Sweden's 1967 switch to right hand traffic. This latter history, in fact, is developed into one of the book's main strands, which is the observation that the more hazardous we perceive our driving environment to be, the safer we are to drive in it. The perception that we are driving in safety, in other words, is the greatest hazard of the road.</p> <p>One disappointment, though, is that Vanderbilt didn't raise his eyes above the tarmac horizon long enough to examine the well-established link between cars and freedom. A staple of the teenage imagination and its representation in film and fiction, we accord the passing of our driving test with the kind of rite-of-passage status our ancestors might have credited a young warrior's victory in battle. The keys to the car equate to the freedom not only to roam far beyond the nest \u2013 or to kill ourselves in the process of trying \u2013 but to look in the rear view mirror and know that we're not in the same place as before.</p> <p>I was free last weekend, so I hired a car and drove my wife and two friends to the North Yorkshire moors. Unaccountably, the hire firm gave me a Mercedes, a big one. Like most of us, my self-image wavers between sex-god genius and potbellied pub-bore, but with three attractive women on board, eyeing the approaching traffic through Mr Daimler's cleverly adapted cross-hairs (apparently the three segments represent the domination of land, sea and air), I felt every bit the big man: rich, powerful and with the acceleration and champagne paint-job to prove it. </p> <p>And then we hit the M1, where the average speed come bank holiday weekend hangs everyone off the same peg. But the longish stretch during which our average speed wavered between one and five mph at least gave me liberty to explore the further phallic reaches of the dashboard, leading eventually to the discovery of something called \"automatic cruise control\". For those not in the know, having indicated a desired speed, lasers on the front of the car get to work calculating your speed in relation to that of the car in front, and adjust it accordingly, completely ignoring your earlier, ridiculously optimistic command to drive at 80mph. Some models even read the white lines to the left and right, steer you safely down the middle. </p> <p>At first all this felt rather dangerous. Once accustomed, though, the details of my true predicament dawned on me. With the traffic pursuing its own progress, seemingly independently of the actions and judgements of the car drivers, I realised that I was sitting in the cramped, if luxuriously so, equivalent of a train compartment \u2013 one, moreover, whose virtual couplings were the only thing of which I was left in control. And even then, \"control\" is to be understood in the strictly limited sense in which I was free to break them, free in a sense to collide with either of the adjacent carriages.</p> <p>As the illusion of power over my own destiny flew out with the exhaust fumes, the sobering thought dawned on me that just as our concept of liberty atrophy in our over-administered society, one of the main metaphors for human freedom \u2013 the car - has kept apace with telling faith. One day, for sure, we will certainly look back with disbelief at the way individual drivers were free to steer and accelerate at will, at the possible expense of their own lives, not to mention those of others. In much the same way, just as we will most likely eventually discredit the backwards society of our fumbling ancestors who extended to parents the right to influence the destiny of the young proto-citizenry that sprang from their loins. </p> <p>Freedom, if the word still exists at such a time, may then equate to the residual degree of discretion when it comes to deciding whether to go off the rails or not, a reduced meaning it is already acquiring in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/mar/01/highereducation.news1\">various reaches</a> of the academy. And the speed with which this metaphor is approaching literality in the sphere of our near gridlocked traffic systems augurs ill. </p> <p>In the meantime, there's always a good walk on the moors. But you know what they say, or at least said on American Werewolf in London: \"Stay on the road. Keep clear of the moors.\"</p>"
