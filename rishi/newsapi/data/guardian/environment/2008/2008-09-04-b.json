Photograph: Katherine Rose</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katherine Rose/Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Here's what generally happens. I book into the chosen restaurant under a pseudonym - usually the name of my companion - go there, eat food and come home again. </p> <p>If I haven't been rumbled - which, to be honest, happens most of the time these days - the first the restaurant will know about it is when the Observer's picture desk calls to arrange to take photographs of both the room and the food. </p> <p>The photographer turns up and is pumped remorselessly for information on what kind of review we're running. For this reason, the picture editor asked me a while back not to tell her what I thought of the restaurant being reviewed. </p> <p>That way, the photographer has no answer to the question and can, in short, be ignorant rather than feign it (I believe the secret intelligence service used the same tactic in the second world war).</p> <p>The point here is that all restaurants are keen to be featured and keen to do everything they can to help our photographer. All restaurants, that is, except the one I reviewed this week. </p> <p>It's called Gourmet San, and it's a very simple, very cheap Szechuan restaurant on Bethnal Green Road in London's East End. Think \u00a345 for two for more fabulous food than you could possibly eat, all of it with a defiant fiery kick.</p> <p>So, I go. I eat. Leave, 100% certain I haven't been rumbled. Picture desk makes the call, and the restaurant people say: \"No thanks. We don't need any extra custom. Almost all our clientele are Chinese, and they don't read the Observer.\" </p> <p>We tried again. You do realise this is a national newspaper that wants to feature your restaurant? \"We don't care. Go away. Scram. Leave us in peace.\" </p> <p>We tried about four times in all, always with the same response.</p> <p>As a result, when the review is published in the magazine on Sunday (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2008/sep/07/restaurants.foodanddrink\">sneak preview here</a> for those of you who want to read it now), what you will see is a photograph of the outside of Gourmet San and a small shot of food in a takeaway container. It seemed the only solution.</p> <p>I have to be honest - I find this hugely refreshing. In an age of fawning chefs and restaurateurs, a restaurant that really doesn't give a toss - no, that actively doesn't want us anywhere near them - is fantastic. </p> <p>This has happened only twice before in the last nine years, and on both occasions the establishments concerned were destined for a bad review and doubtless knew it. </p> <p>One was the caf\u00e9 of the Nation of Islam. As I have said before, this is the best way to deal with an anti-Semitic organisation. Don't engage with their politics. Diss their cooking. The other was a Welcome Break Services. Go figure.</p> <p>This is the first refusal from a place getting a positive review. I have to say that though we were, for a while, literally the only non-Chinese in the place, they were very friendly and welcoming. </p> <p>But, truth be told, I can't guarantee they will continue to be so if people turn up in any number. Certainly I suspect anybody who tries to reference this week's review will get a shrug of boredom that starts from the knees. </p> <p>But, for all that, I urge you to go. What matters here is not whether they want you, but that you should want them. It's some of the best value, best quality Szechuan food available in London at the moment, and it deserves to be tried, picture or no.</p>",
  "<p>Mainly, right now, it's just a forest of figures: 12% wiped off property prices in a year; new mortgage approvals down by 71%; house sales at a 30-year-low; bank lending to homebuyers down by \u00a312.1bn; one in seven homeowners in negative equity within two years; repossession orders up 24%; 45,000 families set to lose their homes.</p> <p>We are transfixed by these numbers. They are writ large on our front pages and lead the news bulletins. Property is our great, our overriding national obsession. To an extent that is unique almost in the world - and certainly in Europe - we follow every twitch of the market with fixated fascination. When it's in trouble, it's like the very soul of the nation is at stake. </p> <p>But there is another story behind the impenetrable array of numbers that our so-called property crisis generates every day (and to which the government was proud to add this week: \u00a3600m emergency rescue package; 1% stamp duty threshold hiked to \u00a3175,000; 340,000 buyers aided; 16,000 reposessions prevented).</p> <p>It's a story about how on earth we came to be in this state. How did we get to a point where grotesque nouveau kitsch mansions in The Bishops Avenue, aka Billionaire's Row in Hampstead, north London, can sell for \u00a340m, small converted mews houses - homes, in other words, for horses - fetch \u00a36m, and 1.6 million people are currently stuck on council waiting lists? </p> <p>How can it be that Notting Hill, a part of London that 50 years ago was a sewage-sodden, low-rent slum, can now contain a top-floor flat bought 40 years ago for \u00a312,000 and now on the market for \u00a3800,000? \"It really wasn't an investment,\" protests its owner, Joy, a recently retired primary-school teacher who understandably does not want her surname widely known. \"I was just buying a place to live. In a pretty daggy part of London, too.\" </p> <p>How, also, has a motormouth Mancunian former joke writer called Mike Shirley been able to parlay his \u00a36,000 purchase of a two-up, two-down terraced house in 1997 into a buy-to-let portfolio worth \u00a37m? And what, at the other end of the scale, has happened in this country that first-time buyers, to obtain a competitively priced mortgage, need a deposit equivalent to two years' take-home, while locals in Cornish fishing villages must confront an average house price of roughly 11 times their earnings?</p> <p>The change has been so massive, so far-reaching, and so rapid that it is easy to forget what things were once like. Less than a century ago, only 10% of Britons owned their own homes. Even 30 years ago, half of us were still renting. Now more than 70% of us are homeowners. And most of that 70% have become an awful lot richer, at least on paper: in October 2007, the average house price in Britain was \u00a3218,000, more than three times the 1995 level, four times the 1988 level, and roughly 50 times the 1970 level. </p> <p>If house prices fall even 20%, most of us will still be very much quids in.</p> <p>According to the housing charity Shelter, in just three decades, from 1971 to 2002, combined housing wealth in Britain spiralled from \u00a344bn to a barely imaginable \u00a32.5tn - that's double the level of pension and life-assurance savings put together. So much money have we made from this unprecedented boom that we've started buying homes not just for ourselves, but for others, too: hundreds of thousands of us are now landlords, holding a total of 1.1m buy-to-let mortgages and ploughing \u00a3126bn into investment property since 1997.</p> <p>So what has driven our insane, headlong pursuit of property ownership? Objective external factors - an influx of foreign money, huge City bonuses - have played a role, particularly in parts of London. Low interest rates have been critical. But there's something even more fundamental than that: simply, we no longer see our homes just as places to live. In the past 30 years, our attitude to them has changed, completely. In fact, we no longer even think \"home\", we think \"property\". We think investment. Capital gain. Sure-fire winner. Gotta do it; get in there; be crazy not to. Right-to-buy, loan-to-value, buy-to-let, remortgage, equity release, rental yield, profit. Lots of it. (Or, just at the moment, not.)</p> <p>With a little help from successive governments only too happy for us all to feel rich, contented and readily inclined to vote for them, and an array of profit-hungry financial institutions embarked on a wildly irresponsible feeding frenzy, we have succeeded in commoditising what should be a fundamental human right: to have a roof over our heads. And once that happens, logically, every profit-seeker and speculator out there moves in, and - equally importantly - all of us who have bought suddenly have a deeply entrenched interest in ensuring that those prices continue to spiral upwards. </p> <p>\"Essentially, what has happened in this country is that we've confused home ownership with the acquisition of wealth,\" says Adam Sampson, Shelter's chief executive. \"Those two concepts, which should be distinct, have become irrevocably yoked together. It shows plainly in the reasons people give for wanting to buy: 30 or 40 years ago, you bought a home for security, stability, status, to gain control over your life. Now you do it to acquire wealth. And that has been encouraged as an article of faith across the political spectrum. It really has been the equivalent of the South Sea Bubble, or the Dutch tulip bulb hysteria.\"</p> <p>Our fixation with ownership has changed the way the country looks, in some places quite radically: go to the centres of cities such as Manchester or Leeds today and the skyline is filled with tower after tower of identical two-bedroom \"luxury\" buy-to-let apartments, 40% of them empty. </p> <p>Built by developers eager to profit from the vast piles of equity Britain's homeowners had accumulated, they have been bought largely by amateur investors who, in many cases, didn't bother to visit the site or even the city beforehand, so convinced were they that they were guaranteed a killing. These were homes for money, not people.</p> <p>In London, the populations and appearance of districts such as Notting Hill have altered beyond all recognition. Home even 30 years ago largely to art students, Irish labourers and new West Indian immigrants, they are now the natural habitat of the hedge-fund trader happy to pay \u00a34m for a house, then another million to rip out and replace last year's comprehensive remodelling. Across the country, 2.3m houses that were publicly owned in 1980 are now private homes (and have not been replaced). In the south-west, equity-rich second-home owners have left some villages half shut-up for 80% of the year; some 241,000 Britons now own second homes in England, and more than 250,000 of us have bought a holiday place abroad. </p> <p>But perhaps even more fundamentally, our ever-ballooning property bubble has changed us. Most of our grandparents' generation did not even dream of owning their homes. For many of our parents, a secure council-house tenancy was the limit of their property ambition. In Harlow new town, Essex, Les and Irene Coben have lived in the same former council house for 51 years. They moved there from two rooms in Whitechapel, East London, and were, Rene recalls, overjoyed at the prospect of an indoor toilet. \"This was a dream house to me,\" says Rene. \"What more could I want?\" (Although even Les, morally opposed to home ownership and loth to saddle himself with a big debt, bowed to the inevitable in the early 1990s and used his retirement money to exercise his right to buy.)</p> <p>Now the vast majority of us feel we have an inalienable right not only to own our home, but to make money out of it. Renting, on the other hand, unless you're doing it short-term with a view to saving up for a deposit or are in between moves, is strictly for losers.</p> <p>Our obsession with ownership has had enormous social consequences. Shelter argues, with good reason, that in today's Britain whether or not a family owns its own home shapes children's lives, affecting their educational opportunities, employment options, life choices and with that, the entire nation's social mobility. </p> <p>(Except it's not quite enough to be born into a home-owning family. Better be born into a family that owns a home in a well-off area, where house values have increased far more than those in less fortunate neighbourhoods. And that's a very recent phenomenon: for the price of an average house in Kensington, the country's wealthiest housing area, 10 years ago, you could have bought two houses in Leven, Fife, the country's poorest. Today, you could buy 24.) </p> <p>Being born into a home-owning family in early 21st-century Britain is not so very different from being born into the aristocracy of old. Meanwhile, in addition to the 149,900 families officially recognised as newly homeless in England, Scotland and Wales in 2007, up to 400,000 mainly single people are classified as the \"hidden homeless\" - those who satisfy the legal definition of homelessness, but have not been provided with long-term accommodation. </p> <p>Our homes now are our pensions, our guarantees of future wealth and happiness, our ever-generous flexible friends. \"Take a bit of equity out\" or \"Stick it on the mortgage\" have become the keys to unlocking a seemingly limitless source of cash: why not use all that dosh locked up in bricks and mortar to pay for a nice new kitchen or loft extension, offer a private education to our children, pay for better holidays or a new car, to help - in time - our offspring onto the property ladder themselves? </p> <p>That is why banks and building societies offered 110% mortgages to borrowers without even demanding proper proof of earnings. That's why some of us borrowed up to seven times our salaries. That's why developers persuaded the nation it needed tens of thousands of luxury two-bed city-centre apartments, and estate agents convinced us tiny flats in dodgy parts of London could be worth \u00a3300,000 (and they were worth that, actually, because that's what some people were happy to pay for them). And that's why we've seen the huge popularity of a whole raft of spin-off products: the property TV show (even I've just made one), the home-improvement mag. We have become, in a way very few other nations have, a people who define ourselves by the places we live in. </p> <p>I have, I confess, a personal interest in all this, because I cannot afford to buy a house for my family in London. Back in 1985, I bought the first and only home I've ever owned here: a small one-bed flat on a busy bus route in Acton. It cost \u00a332,000, which was well under twice what my then wife and I earned in a year (and we had to endure a half-hour grilling with the bank manager to get the loan.)</p> <p>A couple of years later I moved abroad, and in 1989 the flat was sold, for about \u00a370,000. We won't do better than that, I thought. And I stayed abroad, in a range of European cities where most people are just as happy to rent as they are to buy, for nearly 20 years. Last year I came back, and discovered that the same first-time buyer's, one-bed flat was worth, near as dammit, a quarter of a million pounds.</p> <p>That meant, I calculated, that many young couples would probably need to borrow six or seven times their joint income to buy it. Which, it seems to me, is an insane state of affairs. (In fact, even earning what I consider a pretty fair salary, in my late 40s, and taking into account a 10% fall in property prices, I still could barely afford that flat - let alone the three-bed place I now need.)</p> <p>So is there a way out of it? The market itself may do some of the work. Badly burned banks, one hopes, may have learned their lessons about responsible lending; once the present turbulence is over, mortgages will perhaps return to the traditional maximum of two and a half or three times properly verified earnings. That would calm things down. And even if house prices do end up falling 20% or 30%, no one is predicting that will be followed by a repeat of the vertiginous, unsustainable inflation of the past couple of decades. If we all get used to small, steady price increases of maybe 4% or 5%, perhaps we'll stop dreaming our property dreams. Long term, certainly, house prices cannot continue to outstrip the ability of people to pay for them (although there will always be an international market, in London, for excess). </p> <p>But it may take a generation or two before we erase a culture that hammers home, wherever you look, the enticing message that home ownership is the best route to personal wealth. Shelter's Sampson suggests a number of strategies that could, perhaps, speed up the process: first up, a thorough review of the link between housing and taxation. </p> <p>\"There's nothing intrinsically wrong with home ownership,\" he says, \"particularly if the alternative is expensive private renting with a maximum of six months' security of tenure, or increasingly residual social housing. Home ownership encourages stability and social stakeholding. But in recent years my house has earned far more than I have. I work and am taxed; it doesn't and is not. Is that justifiable?\" (It may not be, but there are problems with this option. If you tax the profit made on selling a primary residence, what do you do about a loss?)</p> <p>Less controversially, perhaps, it would help if private renting was a genuine alternative to ownership, as it is in much of mainland Europe, where most tenants benefit from long-term security and relatively low rents. \"We also need to rethink our relationship to the homes we live in,\" says Sampson, who believes the kind of sale-and-leaseback scheme proposed by the government this week to help homeowners threatened with repossession could and should be more common. Just as buyers take years to acquire a house by repaying a mortgage, owners should be able to step out gradually, too. \"We need to reach a point where just because you're no longer the owner, it doesn't mean you have to abandon your house. What you have is a home: you may rent it, you may buy it.\" Or it may be a bit of both.</p> <p>Building enough new houses - which we have not been doing since the 1970s - might help restore us to sanity, too. But the impact would, experts reckon, be marginal: Ireland has practically doubled its house numbers over the past decade, and watched its property prices also double. Gordon Brown has promised to build 3m new homes in Britain between now and 2020, including a deeply controversial clutch of so-called ecotowns but, even assuming the construction business recovers from its current catastrophic slowdown, this is going to be an almost impossible target to meet. </p> <p>Planning constraints, and the often concerted opposition of local homeowners convinced that any major new developments in their back yards will inevitably knock thousands more off the value of their houses, make major new building projects in this country a fraught affair. In the idyllic countryside around Stratford-upon-Avon, for example, the cunningly named Bard campaign (for Better Accessible Responsible Development) is fighting a fierce rearguard action against a 6,000-home ecotown planned for a former MoD site at nearby Long Marston. </p> <p>Some 15,000 people have so far signed Bard's petition against the development, which, it says, meets no discernible local housing or employment needs and will result in thousands of new car commuters - there being little or no public transport - swamping historic Stratford with traffic on their way to the big urban conurbations to the north.</p> <p>Ecotowns have run into some trouble since the prime minister first floated the plan this time last year. Six of the 16 projects, each containing between 5,000 and 20,000 supposedly eco-friendly new homes, 30% them affordable housing, have already fallen by the wayside, and a seventh has been radically scaled back. In the face of mounting local opposition and the very real prospect of court action, the housing minister, Caroline Flint, recently let it be known - albeit discreetly - that the final list of approved projects, now likely to total considerably fewer than the original target of 10, will not be announced until next spring, several months later than scheduled.</p> <p>Bard has some big-name backers, including Dame Judi Dench, John Nettles, Julian Lloyd Webber, publisher Felix Dennis and - rather ironically, given the group's traffic concerns - ex-formula one driver Johnny Herbert. But no matter how valid the arguments, it's hard to believe that Bard's opposition is not also reinforced by nimbyism. Protesters here do fear for their house prices, and several sales have fallen through since the ecotown plan was announced. \"Fundamentally, it's about preserving our existing environment,\" confesses Clive Moy, a retired chartered surveyor. \"Most of us chose to live here, in this wonderful countryside, and the last thing we want is a new town in the middle of it.\" </p> <p>Sampson is not entirely downcast. \"It could be, it just could be, that looked at through the long lens of history, Britain's mad rush towards property ownership over the past 20 or 30 years will be seen as an aberration,\" he says. But in order for that to happen, there will have to be a fundamental shift in our attitudes. Somehow, we are going to have to start thinking of houses simply as homes again. And how many of us are ready to do that? </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The Price of Property, Jon Henley's four-part look at the way the stampede for home ownership has changed Britain, begins at 9pm on Monday on Channel 4.</p>",
  "<p>During his cycle trips around the world, he was shot at by bandits, almost eaten alive by tropical ants and survived close encounters with elephants and lions. But, with sad inevitability, Ian Hibell met his end after being knocked off his bicycle in a collision with a car near Athens. </p> <p>Friends and admirers yesterday paid tribute to Hibell, who died aged 74 after cycling some 250,000 miles in journeys that took him to the most remote and hostile regions of the globe. Over four decades, he would turn up on his touring cycle at far-flung outposts and be welcomed in by the local people. He was given shelter by everyone from Inuit communities in the polar regions to tribesmen in the jungles of Borneo. He survived malaria, the frequent attention of rabid dogs and occasional detention by border guards, and got through more than 800 puncture repair kits. He continued to embark on gruelling journeys in his 70s, taking only a small tent, paraffin stove, waterproof cape, woolly hat and socks when he cycled from Zeebrugge in Belgium to Vladivostok on the Pacific coast of Russia. </p> <p>Hibell, from Brixham, Devon, estimated that he cycled 6,000 miles a year but claimed the most dangerous stretch of road in the world was close to his home. </p> <p>He died while cycling on the Athens to Salonika highway on August 23 after being involved in a collision with a car. The car that was allegedly involved drove away but a man was later arrested. </p> <p>Hibell's friend Nicola Henderson said: \"He had been touring the world more or less continuously for over 40 years. He pushed, dragged or carried his bike from the fringes of Antarctica to the jungles of the Amazon, from the Arctic to the remoter islands of Indonesia.\" Explaining why he was setting off on a hazardous trip to Peru in the late 1970s, he once wrote: \"I like visiting unworldly places; I wanted to test prototype front and rear luggage racks I'd designed ... and I wanted another chance to photograph Peru with less shyness, I hoped, when approaching those multi-skirted, bowler-hatted women I'd been so terrified of before.\"</p> <p>He mainly travelled alone, eking out his modest funds and finding food and shelter wherever he could. Writing about Mongolia he said: \"Approach any yurt, and one is bound to be offered food and often a bed for the night.\" </p> <p>Tributes were yesterday paid on cycling websites.</p> <p>One person who knew him said: \"I always looked forward to seeing him so I could hear his latest adventures, from escaping from armies of soldier ants as they ate his tent, to encounters with exotic tribes that had never seen a white man before, much less one on a bicycle.\"</p>",
  "<p>Your leader (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/04/afghanistan\">Power projection</a>, September 4) was wrong to suggest that the Kajaki hydroelectric project is merely a symbol. If it were only that, we would never have sent our people on such a risky mission. The truth is that this plant has the potential to have enormous practical benefit for the local Afghans.</p> <p>Not only will it, in your own words, once installed, \"provide power and perhaps some prosperity to southern Afghanistan\". It also has the potential to double the area that can be irrigated - and hence, in effect, the area of arable land - south of the dam. </p> <p>You are right to acknowledge that \"as a feat of logistics, this was incredible. As a symbol of western commitment to Afghanistan, it was indisputable.\" Despite that, you argue that it would be preferable for us to be pursuing smaller projects, like solar power. But this is a false choice. There is no reason why we cannot do both. That is why alongside a major endeavour like the Kajaki scheme, the UK-led provincial reconstruction team is already implementing small-scale stabilisation projects. These include improving electrical distribution in Gereshk, installing water towers and a distribution system in Musa Qala and rebuilding the Bazaar in Garmsir. </p> <p>I have been to Kajaki, and I am fully aware of how much remains to be done, both to get the turbine up and running, and then to build and secure the power lines, before the people of Helmand and Kandahar start seeing the benefits. As your news report on the same issue (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/04/afghanistan.waveandtidalpower\">British forces thwart Taliban to deliver turbine. But will it be worth the effort?</a>, September 4) said, \"it will be at least two years before the electricity it generates reaches the 1.8 million intended beneficiaries\". But in my view that only strengthens the case for starting now, building on the achievements of our forces in establishing a degree of security in the area. Indeed this is what the British government has been doing for over two years, military and civilians working together to provide the secure environment necessary for stabilisation, reconstruction and development to take place.</p> <p>We cannot afford to wait for complete security to be established before development begins. The need to combine the two is one of the challenges of Afghanistan, which both we and NGOs are grappling with to support the Afghan government. If any of your readers are in Manchester for the Labour party conference, I invite them to come along to the event where I, representatives from Oxfam and others will be discussing this, and join the debate.</p> <p>Finally, you are too cynical about American motives. USAid is currently pouring hundreds of millions of pounds of aid into southern Afghanistan each year, on a wide range of projects including not just the Kajaki dam but also, for example, the agricultural park in Lashkar Gah, which could help restart Afghanistan's agricultural export industry. Helping this desperately poor country recover from decades of war and conflict will demand a great deal of money and effort from the whole international community, and the generosity of the American people, Congress and government should not be so lightly dismissed.</p> <p>Des Browne MP is the defence secretary <a href=\"mailto:defencesecretary@mod.uk\">defencesecretary@mod.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>A British Airways plane that crashed at Heathrow airport in January was probably brought down by a freak build-up of ice that blocked the fuel supply to its engines, air accident investigators said yesterday.</p> <p>The British Air Accidents Investigation Branch said authorities in Europe and the US should immediately impose interim safety measures on some Boeing 777 aircraft. The crash of flight BA038 was probably caused by a sudden restriction in the aircraft's fuel supply, the AAIB said, following an \"unusual\" combination of factors during the flight from Beijing to Heathrow. The AAIB made three recommendations: </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> That Boeing and engine maker Rolls-Royce impose interim measures to reduce the risk of ice forming in aviation fuel in some Boeing 777s;</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> That aviation watchdogs in the US and European Union investigate the threat to other makes of aircraft and engines;</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> That US and EU authorities review safety requirements for aircraft engines.</p> <p>One expert said aircraft on long-haul journeys may have to fly at lower altitudes until the definitive cause of the crash is discovered. Kieran Daly, group editor of Air Transport Intelligence, said the Boeing 777 would not be the only aircraft affected: \"The AAIB is saying that, for all we know there could be a problem with essentially any long-haul aircraft.\" The AAIB interim report also suggested that the problem could be solved by an anti-icing device used by the military.</p> <p>However, the report stressed the unusual circumstances behind the crash: \"This is the first known occurrence of this nature in any large modern transport aircraft.\" The AAIB said a number of factors probably conspired to bring down BA038 several hundred metres short of Heathrow's south runway at 12.43pm on January 17. Yesterday's interim report said thrust in both the aircraft's engines probably failed because water in the fuel had frozen at altitude, possibly during unusually cold conditions over Siberia, and formed small ice crystals that were released as the plane landed, blocking the fuel supply.</p> <p>The AAIB said: \"This ice is likely to have formed from water that occurred naturally in the fuel whilst the aircraft operated for a long period, with low fuel flows, in an unusually cold environment.\" </p> <p>Investigators said three unique factors came together in flight BA038 that had not been found in 13,000 other flights: the length of time that fuel temperatures stayed below 0C; low fuel flow demands in cruising flight, and high fuel flow demands during landing. They added that the amount of water in the fuel supply - around five litres - was not abnormal.</p> <p>Boeing said last night that it had devised \"a number of operational changes\" to prevent ice building up in 777 fuel systems that used the type of Rolls Royce engine involved in the crash. The National Transportation Safety Board in Washington said it supported the AAIB recommendations.</p> <p>Flight BA038 struck the grassy approach to Heathrow's south runway, crushing its undercarriage - which became detached - and skidding on its belly for several hundred metres. The engines, wings and tail fin of the aircraft were badly damaged by the impact.</p> <p>The 136 passengers and 16 crew were evacuated on emergency slides. </p> <p>One passenger suffered a broken leg in the crashlanding and eight others had minor injuries.

  "<p>Britain's car industry expects sales to fall by about 10% in the rest of the year and that the drop will continue into next year as the country feels the impact of an economic slowdown and rising fuel costs.</p> <p>New car sales have fallen by more than 10% over the past three months and will fall by the same figure - about 85,000 vehicles - for the next four months, according to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. </p> <p>It has duly cut its forecast for sales in 2008 from 2.31m to 2.26m, and from 2.23m to 2.16m for 2009.</p> <p>Sales of new cars in the UK slumped by almost a fifth last month to produce the worst August for the industry since 1966. </p> <p>Top marques were among those hardest hit, with sales of BMWs down almost 40% compared with the same month in 2007, Jaguar down 41%, Land Rover almost 58% lower and Mercedes-Benz recording a drop of 35%, according to the SMMT.</p> <p>Sales of small cars held up better with models such as the Vauxhall Corsa (the month's top seller), the Ford Fiesta and the Mini increasing that segment's share of the market from just under 30% to almost 34%.</p> <p>Sales in the mini segment - usually cars with two doors and engines of less than one litre, such as the Chevrolet Matiz and Hyundai i10 - increased, doubling the sector's market share.</p> <p>The switch towards smaller, more fuel-efficient cars suggests buyers are becoming meaner and greener in the face of the slowdown. Though the number of diesel-powered cars fell for the second month in succession (and diesel's penetration in the UK still lags behind a number of other European markets), they still increased their share of the overall market from 41.4% to 44.3%.</p> <p>Commenting on the 18.6% year-on-year fall in new car registrations, Paul Everitt, the chief executive of the SMMT, said: \"August is one of the quietest months for the new car market, but this year was the lowest since 1966 with only 63,225 registrations. The slowdown mirrors the difficult conditions being experienced across the main European markets.</p> <p>\"Industry is encouraged by the growing interest in lower-carbon cars, but is concerned by the reluctance of consumers to commit to major purchases. There is a clear need for sustained action by government to boost the economy and restore confidence.\"</p> <p>The slump will hit foreign carmakers as well as British ones - about 80% of new cars sold in Britain are imported. Most UK-made cars - just over three quarters - are exported, with British manufacturers enjoying an advantage in a number of key markets because of the weakness of the pound.</p> <p>Jaguar and Land Rover, both now owned by the Indian group Tata, should also benefit from the recent surge in the value of the US dollar against the pound, which will help them compete in what is a key market for the two marques.</p> <p>Nevertheless the UK is an important market for manufacturers based here and their concerns will have been heightened by the SMMT's decision yesterday to cut its forecasts for UK sales for both this year and 2009.</p> <p>Howard Archer, the chief UK and European economist at Global Insight, said: \"Sharply deteriorating car sales are a further clear sign that consumers are increasingly cutting back on their spending.</p> <p>\"Many consumers are doing this out of necessity, due to squeezed purchasing power, but it is also likely that many are retrenching out of choice, reflecting serious concerns about the economic situation and outlook.\"</p>",
  "<p>I was thinking of getting my hair cut next week, but in light of recent events of St James' Park I think I'll just let it grow for a while. When left to its own devices my hair twines itself into a feathery silver bouffant, giving me the look of someone who ought to be hosting a daytime TV quiz show. Still, the occasional witty cry of \"I'll have an E please, Bob\" as I pass the smokers standing outside the local pubs will likely be better than the alternative. </p> <p>You see, my barber is a Newcastle season ticket-holder. Like all Geordies he is keen on talking (I used to think I talked a lot, then I moved to Northumberland. Now I consider myself laconic). The minute I sit down, he whisks the nylon cape around me, pumps the chair lever, fires up his clippers and starts in telling me what - in the prevailing view of his social club - has been going on at the Toon of late. And he doesn't stop snipping and shaving until he's finished. At times of high drama - and they come thick and fast in Newcastle, let's be honest - you need a buffer zone of extra hair to fill the time. Otherwise, you're going to go in and ask for a number three at the back and sides and a tidy-up on top and come out looking like Duncan Goodhew after an accident with the Immac. </p> <p>I discovered this the hard way, the week after the Hall-and-Shepherd-Fake-Sheikh fiasco. There were times during those two-and-a-half hours when I seriously wondered if I was going to keep my ears.</p> <p>There is another barber in the town, but I abandoned him after a previous incident. The other barber is a Newcastle season ticket-holder too, but he is altogether more febrile and less focused. I was sitting in his chair the day Kevin Keegan signed Alan Shearer. When a passing market trader yelled the news through the door, the barber leaped in the air, flung down his comb and rushed out into the street singing that ancient Geordie hymn of praise and deliverance: \"Whack Your Lass With A Christmas Tree, Ay-oh, Ay-oh.\" </p> <p>In his euphoria the barber had apparently forgotten that for the past five years he had ridiculed the Blackburn and England striker as \"Billy Bigpockets\". \"You think he's avaricious, then?\" I asked him. \"I wouldn't know about that,\" he replied as he squirted water on my head. \"But he's a greedy bugger for definite.\"</p> <p>I waited for the barber to return from his celebrations, but he never did. The next time I saw him was later that evening on the local news, chanting outside St James'. I went away with my hair half-cut, hanging asymmetrically across my brow. When I got on the bus to go home the man behind me started whistling \"Don't you want me baby\". I have not been back to that barber since. </p> <p>The peculiar antics of Mike Ashley have kept my hair in squaddie-like shape ever since his arrival in the north-east. The rotund retail maverick has moved from being a seldom-seen recluse to somebody who appears on TV downing a pint and watching the football, wearing the sort of blank yet benign expression adopted by the Queen when attending a break-dancing display by disadvantaged youngsters. In the meanwhile he has edged away from being widely celebrated as a black-and-white saviour, to the current position in which he seems to have achieved the impossible - making Newcastle fans speak with wistful chuckles of the glorious, happy stewardships of Gordon McKeag and Lord Westwood. </p> <p>I exaggerate, of course, though I couldn't help noticing that a few weeks ago my taxi driver - a wild-haired Yeti from the West Durham boondocks - referred to McKeag, the former chairman known locally as Mr McGreed, as \"a total shitehawk\". I feel the dropping of the words \"utter bloody\" from that description points to a growing rehabilitation of the fellow. </p> <p>I doubt, however, that Lord Westwood (also known as The Pirate) will ever again stride past The Strawberry without people yelling: \"Where's your parrot, you thieving bastard.\" And since he has been dead for some considerable time, that's probably just as well.</p> <p>On my last visit to the barber's, at the end of July, I was unkempt and in need of a severe trimming, so I asked him what he made of Newcastle's lack of activity in the transfer market. \"Ashley's supposed to have all this money,\" I said, \"but he hasn't spent any.\" </p> <p>\"Aye, well, we've weighed it up from all angles, haven't we,\" the barber said, his scissors clicking demonically. \"I mean, from what you hear the bloke's been hit by the fall of share values on Wall Street, there's been the Northern Rock business ...\" He continued in this vein until the floor around me was ankle-deep in hair \"... and the general global economic downturn, which is all mitigating circumstances, obviously. </p> <p>\"Credit to the fella for making his fortune off his own bat, and maybe we don't see the bigger picture and everything, but at the end of the day the conclusion we've come to is that...\" he paused for a moment to stare over my head and look me in the eye, via the mirror \"...he's a bit of a useless get. Is that short enough, for you?\"</p>",
  "<p>Wall Street stocks suffered their sharpest fall for two months yesterday as dismal US employment figures and rumours of hedge fund failures cast a cloud of gloom over trading floors.</p> <p>In a downcast day on both sides of the Atlantic, shares slid amid increased alarm about the perilous condition of the global economy. The FTSE 100 index ended 137.6 points lower at 5362.1 as banking shares were affected by a decision by the European Central Bank to make it harder for institutions to tap its funds for greater liquidity.</p> <p>In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fared worse, plunging by 344 points to 11,188, putting it firmly in \"bear market\" territory with a drop of more than 20% from its peak.</p> <p>The mood was darkened by an unexpected jump of 15,000 in the weekly number of new applications for unemployment benefit in the US, plus a report from consultants ADP Employer Services that revealed a cut of 33,000 jobs by private employers during August.</p> <p>\"We're seeing nothing but sellers,\" said Ted Oberhaus, director of equity trading at the investment firm Lord, Abbett &amp; Co. \"In a bear market you don't really need an excuse to sell.\"</p> <p>In London, British banks suffering a sell-off included HBOS, which fell nearly 7% to 282.5p, while Barclays was down 6% at 329.25p. Other sectors were also hit by wider economic woes as Marks &amp; Spencer shares fell more than 5% over worries about its trading prospects.</p> <p>The ECB's decision to restrict use of its system to unfreeze the credit market followed concerns that it had been open to misuse. The bank is increasing the price it is charging for banks to swap toxic mortgage-backed securities for more liquid funds from next February. Instead of receiving 98 for 100 of assets, banks will receive 83.60 in some instances under the new rules.</p> <p>The ECB's liquidity package, brought in a year ago when the credit crunch started to bite, was being widely used by banks in Europe and is said to have allowed some banks to adjust to the harsher economic realities. Jean-Claude Trichet, the bank's president, said the changes aimed to improve risk control. \"We don't think it will impair the way the system is functioning and the capacity of the banks to go to our operations,\" Trichet said. </p> <p>American stocks were pressed downwards late in the day by speculation that volatility could claim more hedge fund victims in the wake of this week's closure of a commodities fund run by Ospraie Management.</p> <p>One of New York's best-known hedge funds, Atticus Management which looks after $14bn, was forced to deny that it was selling off its assets. Tim Barakett, its founder, said: \"We've heard these rumours as well and they're not true.\"</p> <p>The technology dominated Nasdaq index fell 74 to 2,259 while the broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 basket slipped 38 to 1,236 - its fourth straight decline, making it the longest period of losses since January.</p> <p>A steady drip feed of gloomy news has harmed hopes of a swift recovery from the global credit crunch, and a glut of trading statements from retailers in the US gave little cause for optimism. Leading chains such as Target, CostCo, Gap and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch all revealed falls in like-for-like sales in August, although the world's biggest retailer, Wal-Mart, bucked the trend with a 3% increase excluding fuel.</p> <p>\"If you look at the data we have on the US and global economy, things are only getting worse, \" Diane Garnick, a strategist at Invesco in New York, told Bloomberg News.</p> <p>\"That leads me to believe that demand is going to slow down and slow down pretty quickly.\"</p> <p>The market turmoil also came along with a warning that a fully fledged global recession appeared \"unavoidable\" without strong and internationally coordinated action on macroeconomic policy.</p> <p>In its annual trade and development report, the UN Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) said the global economy was teetering on the brink of recession because of the fallout from the financial crisis in the US, the bursting of the housing bubbles in large economies, soaring commodity prices, increasingly restrictive monetary policies and stockmarket volatility.</p> <p>Unctad expects the pace of world output to fall to about 3% in 2008 - almost one percentage point less than in the past two years.</p> <p>The report also said that there was mounting evidence that developing countries, which up until now have remained resilient in the midst of the credit crunch, \"cannot escape the global slowdown\".</p>",
  "<p>Proposition: everything comic in American film was pioneered long ago by Preston Sturges. For example, why was Governor Sarah Palin's teenage daughter holding her newborn brother as their mother was introduced as vice-presidential candidate? To demonstrate family togetherness? Or to conceal the fact that the teenager is five months pregnant? Put it another way, why did David Gordon Green make Pineapple Express for producer Judd Apatow? Because he's a connoisseur of weed? Or because whether he's buying weed or Weetabix, he needs a bit of money?</p> <p>At the age of 25, Green burst upon the movie world with George Washington, one of the most personal and searching independent films made in America. Critics raved at the visual style, the feeling for drabness on the edge of industrial cities in the south, and the easy embrace of blacks and whites, adults and children. In nearly every respect, George Washington was made in defiance of Hollywood attitudes and methods. Green was unashamed of his originality or what some saw as his \"difficulty\". </p> <p>George Washington won the New York Film Critics Circle award for best first film. On a budget of just over $40,000, it grossed $240,000 in the US - a healthy six-to-one ratio. Green then moved up in scale. For Jean Doumanian Productions and Sony Classics, he made All the Real Girls, with Zooey Deschanel. This time the picture cost $2.5m, and it grossed just over $500,000. Two other films followed - Undertow and Snow Angels - and if observers noted a modest rise in humour, they detected no change in the attitude towards entertainment. And these two films did badly again.</p> <p>Green was working at the level where he contributes his own soul and experience and sometimes his own money. This cannot go on forever, at least where the money is concerned. Green has not really discussed his problem in public, beyond admitting that a film-maker needs to live and asserting that he had always been intrigued by more crowd-pleasing genres. At any event, he accepted the invitation from Apatow to make Pineapple Express, a farcical adventure in the weed trade and a movie just like other Apatow ventures - crude, juvenile, passingly funny, cheerfully aimed at cleaning up. Pineapple Express was written by Seth Rogen, a writer used to Apatow's needs. Green only directed. But now he had a budget of $23m, with gross returns so far of about $80m. It is a hit, which proves only that David Gordon Green can make a Seth Rogen film.</p> <p>Green is in a pickle. He will have been paid better than ever before. He will have been praised to the skies by Apatow and others. He may attempt to make a new deal for one of \"his\" pictures, but the habit of new money is hard to shake. And he will have to decide exactly what a film has to be to be \"his\". It is a very old question and one that undermined Sturges in his time. But truly the room to manoeuvre was greater in the 1940s than it is now. An authentically independent voice has to determine whether to be himself or talk like idiots. Or does he dream that he may make the first grown-up film about weed? For his fans it's hard to give up on the candid but delicate portrait of young black kids in George Washington. What about a comedy about a girl in the White House who is a little bit pregnant?</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The web version of this article was amended on Thursday September 4 2008. The print version of the article above incorrectly said that Sarah Palin's newborn baby was a girl. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown signalled last night that there would be no one-off payment to soften the impact of rising fuel bills in a package of measures expected to be released next week. But in a speech to the Scottish CBI, he sought to lift the gloom surrounding the wider economy, saying he was cautiously optimistic that underlying strengths would help Britain weather the global crisis.</p> <p>Ministers had considered a direct payment to ease the impact of rising fuel costs. But the package will instead centre on extra financial help from electricity producers to pay for home efficiency measures, targeted at low-income households. The prime minister still hopes to tout the programme as worth \u00a31bn, but Downing Street is concerned that the package will disappoint Labour MPs eager to see a big windfall tax on the electricity firms.</p> <p>Brown said he was working up proposals with the utility companies. He told the Scottish CBI: \"Not short-term gimmicks, or giveaways, but firm steps towards making every home in Britain more energy efficient, thus reducing bills not just temporarily, but permanently. You cannot address a long-term problem - the supply and demand for oil - with a short-term gimmick.\"</p> <p>Government sources said all the additional direct government help to soften the impact of fuel bills had already been set out in the March budget when increases in the winter fuel allowance had been announced.</p> <p>Ministers are focusing on extracting extra funding from the energy companies for the carbon emissions reduction target programme, a \u00a32.75bn, three-year obligation on energy suppliers to install home-based energy efficiency measures for people on low incomes, those with disabilities, and those aged over 70. But talks with the energy firms are incomplete.</p> <p>Richard Lambert, the CBI's director general, warned against a windfall tax, saying the worst way to assist the fuel-poor \"would be to impose an arbitrary and unfair tax on the energy industry, just at a moment when we want those same companies to be preparing for vastly increased investment in our energy infrastructure\". But the Local Government Association said the big six electricity producers had boosted dividend payments to shareholders by \u00a3257m over the last year, suggesting they were not putting profits into investment.</p> <p>Neal Lawson, chairman of the Compass group which had pushed for a windfall tax, said: \"It is not a short-term gimmick to heat the homes of the poor and vulnerable. What people want is the warm glow of knowing the government is on their side; they are not getting it.\"</p> <p>Brown said he was \"cautiously optimistic about the long-term resilience ... of the British economy\". He said: \"At root our economy is better placed to weather any global economic storm than it was [in] the 70s, 80s or early 90s.\"</p> <p>After Alistair Darling's more gloomy forecasts in his recent Guardian interview, Brown said he rested his optimism on historically low interest rates, subdued wage pressures, fast-growing productivity, continued low levels of public debt as a proportion of national income, and the \"most robust independent competition regime anywhere in the world\".</p> <p>The government would not let down hard-working families on modest and middle income families: \"We will ensure that no one who is prepared to work hard and adapt to change will lose out as a result of global forces.\" But Britain could not be immunised against the first great financial crisis of the global age, a crisis allied to a \"global credit crunch\".</p> <p>George Osborne, shadow chancellor, said: \"The prime minister is in denial about both the crisis of confidence in his leadership and the economic crisis facing the country. His speech is totally at odds with the bleak assessment given by his chancellor just five days ago.\"</p>",
  "<p>To some, Asif Ali Khan Zardari is a corrupt, bullying chancer who was a political liability for his late wife, Benazir Bhutto. To others, the 53-year-old politician is a likeable, experienced and sharp-witted middle-aged man who finally has his chance. For a few, he is all these things at once. One thing is sure: Zardari, who is expected to be elected Pakistan's new president tomorrow, is a highly controversial figure and seems unlikely to be the man who can unite 175 million fractious Pakistanis. </p> <p>\"His first approach is always to make friends - but you wonder when the fist might come out,\" said Najam Sethi, editor of several newspapers. \"He has a kind of natural intelligence and is very charming,\" said one neutral observer who has known Zardari since childhood. \"But it is difficult to know whether his charm is a highly effective act or quite how bright he actually is. He could just be doing a good impression of both.\"</p> <p>Such contradictions seem an integral part of the man. Zardari grew up in Karachi, Pakistan's southern port city, son of a landlord and unsuccessful cinema owner. As a teenager, he was known primarily for his skill at polo and driving fast, though his disregard for risk sometimes had a positive side. When riding one evening in the mid-1980s with an elite equestrian club on the outskirts of Karachi, a foreign diplomat's daughter rode into a dangerous swamp. \"About 50 people stood around watching as she sank into quicksand,\" a witness told the Guardian. \"Zardari waded in and hauled her out. He's brave.\"</p> <p>His arranged marriage in 1987 to Benazir Bhutto, the daughter of former Pakistani prime minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, surprised many and brought him into the central current of his nation's turbulent political life. A year later Bhutto led the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) to victory in elections after the military dictator Zia ul-Haq died in a mysterious plane crash. She promised \"food, shelter and clothes\" for the masses. Two years later, her administration was dismissed amid allegations of corruption and incompetence. Zardari was imprisoned on charges of blackmail.</p> <p>Over the next 14 years, Zardari alternated periods of liberty and incarceration. When the PPP regained power in 1993, Bhutto made her husband minister of investment, a controversial decision given the reputation for graft Zardari had acquired during the party's first stint in office. Through the early 1990s he collected a breathtaking range of allegations of corruption, implication in murder, attempted embezzlement and even drug trafficking.</p> <p>After a second, lengthier stint in prison following Bhutto's second fall from power, Zardari was released after lengthy negotiations between the PPP and General Pervez Musharraf, then in power, in 2004. Zardari dismisses the various charges as political smears and, now that Swiss magistrates who seized millions in accounts linked to Bhutto and her husband have dropped their investigations, there is not a single outstanding case against him. \"All through his time in prison he showed an incredible resilience,\" said one journalist who interviewed him repeatedly. \"He always seemed sure the tide would turn.\"</p> <p>No one doubts that Zardari is a survivor. Released in 2004, he kept a low profile, undergoing medical treatment in America and only getting involved in active politics shortly before his wife's return to Pakistan in October last year. His reappearance at strategy planning sessions in London dismayed many PPP stalwarts. Power has earned him more supporters, however. \"He's an older and wiser man. He's got health problems, he watches his diet, he doesn't drink any longer,\" said a Pakistani political activist. \"He and Benazir were both very young when they came to power. They made mistakes.\"</p> <p>A former close associate from the early 1990s spoke, with no obvious irony given the frequent charges of egregious nepotism levelled at Zardari, of how Bhutto's widower \"always goes out of his way to help out his friends and even those who somehow reach him for help for jobs, financial help etcetera\". But others describe an arrogant, uncultivated and often impatient man ruthless with his enemies. Some accuse Zardari of frequent personal abuse of subordinates. An ally who preferred to remain anonymous said: \"He is not a man you want to be on the wrong side of.\"</p> <p>Twenty years' experience has taught Zardari much about the brutal game of Pakistani politics. When his wife died, he moved swiftly to secure control of the PPP, sidelining his son and skilfully assuming the Bhutto mantle. However, Zardari is far from an intellectual and does not share his late wife's profound interest in geopolitics or economics, nor her education, eloquence or charisma.</p> <p>\"He doesn't read much, it's true,\" said an ally. \"But you don't necessarily need to be a bookworm type to be president of Pakistan.\" In the Zardari camp there is quiet jubilation. Few predicted this victory. Zardari will savour it.</p> <h2>CV</h2> <p><strong>Born</strong> July 26 1955 in Nawabshah, Pakistan</p> <p><strong>Family</strong> Married Benazir Bhutto in 1987 (she was assassinated in 2007), three children, Bilawal, Bakhtwar and Aseefa</p> <p><strong>Political career</strong> Member national assembly 1990-93 and 1993-96; federal minister of the environment 1993-1996; federal minister of investment 1995-96; transformed the power sector by encouraging investment opportunities.

  "<p>The infant science of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/01/climatechange.scienceofclimatechange2\">geo-engineering</a> \u2013 one that so many would gladly see strangled in its cradle \u2013 could grow into the best job creation scheme for universities ever invented. Every one of the contributors to the Royal Society's Philosophical Transactions special on how to confront global warming with <a href=\"http://publishing.royalsociety.org/index.cfm?page=1570\">gee-whizz technology</a> warns that the engineering is difficult, the outcome unpredictable, the side-effects possibly perilous and the expense prodigious. And that before any of it gets attempted, more research will be necessary.</p> <p>For those who have been asleep in the back of the class: a tiny rehearsal. Geo-engineering is one of the get-out-of-jail-free cards routinely played by the climate change sceptics when it begins to look, even to them, as though global warming might after all be a reality and that profligacy with human resources might \u2013 just might \u2013 have played some marginal role. Well, they say: why give up our cars, our technology, our cheap air travel and our patio heaters? Human ingenuity will surely find a way out of the situation. What's wrong with uncontrolled growth? Surely more wealth means more technological potential, higher population levels mean an even bigger crop of really clever people to find future solutions. And, they point out, so many doomsayers have been wrong in the past, who says the current bunch will be right now?</p> <p>So according to this argument, geo-engineering could be the perfect technological response to a problem fuelled in the first place by profligate technological invention. Why not place a tier of sunshades a million miles from Earth, at a strategic point between the planet and the sun to deflect or absorb a proportion of the solar radiation? Why not erect thousands of vast structures to absorb surplus carbon dioxide and bury it, the way trees soak up the stuff and turn it into wood? Why not darken the clouds with sulphur particles, and recreate the murk of acid rain, but at least stop the poles from melting?</p> <p>Why not cruise across the oceans in robot wind-powered sailing vessels spraying fine particles of brine toward the clouds, to seed condensation and make them whiter and more reflective? Why not dust the oceans with iron filings and trigger carbon-consuming plankton blooms, or achieve the same effect by mixing deep and surface ocean waters, with an array of vast floating funnels? Some or all these things would bring the planetary thermometer tumbling to comfortable levels, and then we could go on as before.</p> <p>And this is the point at which the scientists published by the Royal Society become embarrassed cheerleaders for the technological fix. It would be so much better, they all agree, if the world changed its ways, reduced its dependence on fossil fuels, and tried to live sustainably.</p> <p>But since almost nobody shows any real signs of wishing to adopt the sustainable answer \u2013 and that includes most of the nations that have signed up to the Kyoto protocol, never mind the ones that have no intention of doing so \u2013 then we had better think about some other options now, they argue, because a decade down the line it will be too late. It may seem daft to mitigate the challenge of energy profligacy by expending even more energy, of responding to uncontrolled economic growth by spending even more money on even more ambitious projects, but \u2013 they argue \u2013 tough. What else should we do? Let us at least look at the technological challenges.</p> <p>So in each paper, in the preface and in the critiques, the ideas come with explicit or implied intellectual health warnings. The stratagems may not work at all, or they may work too well and threaten to tip the world into an ice age, or they may seem to work for a while but just trigger some other, unforeseen chain reaction in the great climate machine, and so make things worse, or they may alleviate global warming in one of the few areas of the planet where people would welcome it but make things even worse for rival or partner nations across the sea or on the other side of the mountain range. The ideas might be sound, but the proposed technologies might not be up to the challenge, and require rethinking. The energy costs might be too high (although hardly as high as the cost of doing nothing and letting global warming run away) or the scientific understanding behind the logic of temperature manipulation on a planetary scale might turn out to be incomplete.</p> <p>That's where the academic job creation programme begins. Climate modellers think they understand the climate machine well enough to make a set of predictions about the future. But it is one thing to make detailed predictions about temperatures and sea levels in 2100, after not just you but your grandchildren are dead; quite another to devise a set of actions that could take charge of global thermometer in the next decade, and on your watch. To do that, researchers would have to understand the behaviour of the planet in the finest detail: the role of sea-spray in the condensation of clouds, the intricate pattern of the winds all the way up to the stratosphere and beyond, the chemistry of clouds, the significance of dust storms in the Sahara and central Asia, the enigmatic interplay between ocean temperatures and continental weather systems, the importance of forests and grasslands and the knock-on effects of precise human behaviour. A series of geo-engineering studies would make researchers ask themselves questions, and test hypotheses, and begin to understand the planet in an entirely new way.</p> <p>It would be money well spent. This is the only home we have: the more we appreciate it, the better. It would be money even better spent if \u2013 while university departments were working on space mirrors, chemical sunshades and the greening of the oceans \u2013 governments and peoples took the hint and found effective ways to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, restore the rainforests and protect the oceans. That way, we'd all win: we'd save the planet and at the same time understand more about the planet we had just saved; we'd save money on fuel and we wouldn't even have to build the expensive planet-saving machinery the research was designed to test.</p> <p>The only flaw is that the British may not have the maths, physics, geochemistry or geophysics or engineering graduates to even begin the job, let alone finish it, but that's a different problem.</p>",
  "<p>A pub food price war has broken out among Britain's biggest budget pub restaurant operators as consumers are increasingly reining in their discretionary spending.</p> <p>Yesterday Whitbread, which operates the Beefeater and Brewers Fayre chains, showed a surprising surge in sales - up 6% for the 24 weeks to August 14 - after revamping about a quarter of its pubs last year and keeping prices tight on its menus. The pubs, many of which are located next door to Whitbread's Premier Inns where the food and drink offer is very limited, increased comparable sales by 2.4%. </p> <p>Analysts suggested that Whitbread was one of a band of large pub restaurant operators using value-meal promotions to grab market share. At Brewers Fayre a daytime two-meal offer of a 10oz gammon steak and chicken tikka masala for \u00a39 has been very popular, as has Cornish pastie, chips and baked beans for \u00a34.99.</p> <p>Chief executive Alan Parker said visitors to pub restaurants were up 9.3%. Paul Hickman, an analyst at the brokerage KBC Peel Hunt, said this strong growth suggested \"energetic promotion activity, which will have a margin effect\".</p> <p>Similar promotional pushes are being seen at several rival budget pub restaurants, including Mitchells &amp; Butler's \"pub and carvery\" format, where the average cost of a meal is \u00a33.96, Greene King's Hungry Horse chain and Wetherspoon's.</p> <p>JD Wetherspoon, which publishes its full-year results this morning, is expected to report a decline in profit margin, blaming higher costs of promotional deals, many of them centred around food. Wetherspoon's promotions include meal and drink promotions for \u00a35.99 at some pubs and price freezes on a range of drinks until March 2009.</p> <p>Meanwhile, at Whitbread's Premier Inn budget hotel chain, cost-conscious business travellers and holidaymakers have boosted sales. The leisure group, which also runs Costa coffee shops, has emerged as a beneficiary of the credit crunch as Britons find ways to economise on travel and eating out.</p> <p>Premier Inn, which accounts for the bulk of Whitbread's profits, has outperformed the wider hotel market, with like-for-like sales up 10.2% for the 24 weeks to August 14. The 570-strong hotel chain is on track to open more than 4,000 new rooms this year. Despite Premier Inn adding 1,157 new rooms, overall occupancy rates were down only 2% while revenue per available room - a key measure for the hotel industry - was up 5.8%. </p> <p>Alan Parker, the chief executive, said Premier Inn was increasingly attracting business customers as companies cut their travel budgets amid fears that the economy is sliding into recession. \"Large companies realise they have to save money,\" he said. \"Why pay more than \u00a3100 to stay in a four-star hotel when you can pay \u00a350?\"</p> <p>Business travellers make up 60% of Premier Inn sales in cash terms, with leisure travellers accounting for the remaining 40%. Business customers tend to stay two nights and spend more while leisure travellers usually stay one night. Leisure bookings slowed in June and July, though August was strong.</p> <p>Paul Hickman at KBC Peel Hunt said Premier Inn was \"currently enjoying an Aldi effect through corporate buyers' cost-cutting, though we feel this may be overtaken by headwinds in 2009 as unemployment rises\".</p> <p>Like-for-like sales across the group climbed by 7%, with growth also seen in Whitbread's two other divisions: pub restaurants and Costa coffee.</p> <p>The group reiterated it remained \"vigilant in these challenging economic times and alert to whatever further action is required\".</p> <p>Faced with soaring food and energy inflation, Whitbread has implemented a \u00a325m cost-saving programme, which involved bringing the hotel and restaurant management teams together. It has also made changes to staff scheduling.</p> <p>Like-for-like sales at the 1,100-outlet Costa chain - where the average spend is just over \u00a32 - rose by 3.7%, having been up by more than the 6% growth experienced in the first quarter. Total sales surged 23.6%, driven by Costa's rapid expansion - it now has 331 cafes overseas. It opened in Beijing before the Olympics and has 30 outlets in China plus a handful in Russia.</p> <p>\"There are no obvious signs to date that the business is being affected by the weakening economic environment,\" said Sam Hart at Charles Stanley stockbrokers.</p>",
  "<p>The equivalent of a fortnight's average rainfall is expected to deluge parts of the UK today as a miserable summer is followed by the first big storm of the autumn. Heavy rain and gusty winds are expected to sweep in from the Atlantic, with forecasters warning that some areas will suffer localised flooding. </p> <p>South-west England and Wales will bear the brunt of today's storms, with 50mm of rain and 50mph winds expected. The north-west, which had both sun and showers yesterday afternoon, is not likely to escape the downpour either as the poor weather moves to affect northern areas.</p> <p>The latest instalment of foul weather follows one of the wettest Augusts on record. The Met Office has issued a weather warning because of the heavy rain.</p> <p>\"We have yet another area of low pressure swinging into south-west England during the morning. A band of heavy rain will move north and north-east across the whole of Britain,\" a spokeswoman said. \"Ultimately it will have started raining in the early hours in southern England, and this will spread northwards towards lunchtime. Humberside and north Wales will see the heaviest of the rain.\"</p> <p>She said more than 50mm was expected to fall in places, particularly on higher ground, equivalent to half the monthly rainfall in southern England and south Wales (106mm a month). </p> <p>\"At the moment it is just a continuation of the August weather,\" the spokeswoman added. \"We were looking for little ridges of high pressure that we would traditionally find at the beginning of September which bring fine spells, but unfortunately they are not on the charts at the moment.\"</p> <p>Last night, a driver whose 4x4 vehicle became stuck in a swollen river in mid Wales was winched to safety by an RAF Sea King helicopter. The car was swamped while trying to drive across a ford, four miles from Welshpool, and rescue services feared it could be swept away. </p> <p>The helicopter, based nearly 100 miles away at Valley in Anglesey, landed the driver unharmed in a nearby field.</p> <p>A road in Gloucester beneath a railway bridge that was flooded last year was under water again yesterday. The Severn Area Rescue Association, whose lifeboat has been used on the river, has been placed on standby. </p> <p>Homes in Lydney, Gloucestershire, were under water after a drain failed to cope with the rain. Fire crews and council workers were at the scene yesterday afternoon helping stricken families to pump the water out and delivering sandbags. </p> <p>A resident said: \"This happened in February and this time it's even worse. The problem is that the drainage is inadequate in times of heavy rain. It's been unable to cope since new houses went up in the area.\" Some families affected by yesterday's flooding had only just finished repairing damage from the last flood. </p> <p>Gloucestershire fire and rescue said it was very busy, and asked people to contact it only in an emergency.</p> <p>The Environment Agency has three flood warnings in place, all in Wales. They are at Ewenny village, Pencoed and the river Ely at Peterston-super-Ely, near Cardiff. Eleven areas were on flood watch in the south-west, Midlands, Thames and Welsh regions.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, the number of people suffering from seasonal affective disorder, which affects 4 million across the UK, has reached a record high because of the poor summer. Amanda Cross, of the charity Sada, said: \"Many people already find autumn a difficult time of the year, with summer - and this one wasn't particularly great - seemingly a distant memory.\"</p> <p>However, there is some good weather news on the distant horizon. The Met Office says its long-term forecast for September to November suggests there will be less rainfall than average.</p>",
  "<p>The Archbishop of Canterbury has pandered to conservatives in the Anglican communion by scapegoating and marginalising homosexual Christians, a senior cleric claimed yesterday.</p> <p>The Right Rev John Bryson Chane, Bishop of Washington and one of the most influential figures in the liberal-majority wing of the US Episcopal church, made the remarks about the Lambeth conference, the 10-yearly gathering of the world's Anglican bishops that took place in Canterbury in July and August this year. </p> <p>The three-week summit saw Rowan Williams attempting to avoid schism by reinforcing a ban on gay bishops and same-sex blessings, moratoriums aimed at appeasing conservative evangelicals who were infuriated at the inclusive nature of some US and Canadian churches.</p> <p>Chane said: \"There was far too much recognition of those who chose not to participate in this Lambeth conference and far too little recognition of those bishops who chose to come.\"</p> <p>His comments, in an article called Stop the Scapegoating, published on a US website, are the most scathing yet about Williams, and he is the first US liberal to break ranks with his church and condemn Lambeth. Bishops from the Episcopal church maintained a united front at Canterbury, despite internal divisions over central issues, and remained on-message by stressing the positives. His assessment is more critical than the one issued by primates from the breakaway conservative movement the Global Anglican Future Conference (Gafcon).</p> <p>Chane took Williams to task over several matters, notably his overtures towards the Gafcon bishops who boycotted the religious summit.</p> <p>\"In order to placate those primates and bishops who chose to absent themselves and to quell the growing dissension within the Church of England over the decision to ordain women bishops, and the issues of human sexuality in holy orders, </p> <p>Williams sought what he believed was a middle way that unfortunately continues to marginalise the Canadian and American churches.\"</p> <p>He observed that Lambeth could have been a positive turning point for the Anglican communion, but instead \"the powers that be\" chose to seek a middle way that was neither \"the middle\" nor \"the way\".</p> <p>He concluded that he could not comply with the archbishop's request to uphold the moratoriums.</p>",
  "<p>The Bank of England left interest rates on hold at 5% for the fifth month running yesterday in the face of growing evidence that the economy is rapidly heading into recession.</p> <p>The Bank's announcement followed figures from the Halifax that showed house prices were falling at the fastest pace it had ever recorded, while car sales in August fell nearly 20%.</p> <p>There are growing expectations in the City that the monetary policy committee will soon cut interest rates in response to a rapid slowdown in the economy but few were surprised by yesterday's decision.</p> <p>\"A rate cut is only a matter of time,\" said Peter Dixon, analyst at Commerzbank in London. \"[We] assess the MPC's inactivity today as part of a waiting game to see how the balance between growth and inflation pans out. While inflation is currently at the top of the MPC's agenda, it will not be long before the weakness of growth assumes a priority.\"</p> <p>Despite signs of an economic slowdown and warnings of a recession in the UK, the MPC has been reluctant to cut interest rates because inflation is at 4.4% - more than double the MPC's government-set target of 2%. It is likely to rise further in the next month or two as higher gas and electricity prices feed into the figures. But thereafter the MPC and the City expect inflation to fall very rapidly, a view reinforced by the recent sharp falls in energy prices, with oil down by nearly 30% from its July peak.</p> <p>Unions, though, expressed dismay at the Bank's lack of action. The TUC's head of economics and social affairs, Adam Lent, said: \"A cut would have offered hope to all those who fear for their jobs and homes, and helped cut through the economic pessimism that is now doing as much damage as the credit crunch and energy prices.\"</p> <p>The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development forecast this week that Britain, alone among its G7 peers, would head into recession in the second half of this year, dragged down by a combination of credit crunch, housing market collapse and the negative effect of a strong pound on exports.</p> <p>The full extent of the housing market's collapse was revealed yesterday by the Halifax, which said average house prices tumbled by 1.8% last month from July, the fifth month in a row they have fallen by at least 1.5%. They were down 12.7% from a year earlier, the biggest fall since the Halifax records began in 1983. \"The pressure on householders' income, together with the reduction in the availability of mortgage finance due to the global financial markets crisis, is resulting in both lower property prices and activity levels,\" Halifax chief economist Martin Ellis said. \"Market conditions will remain challenging.\"</p> <p>The European Central Bank also left interest rates steady yesterday, at 4.25%, in spite of a similarly sharp drop in economic activity in the eurozone. However, the OECD forecast stagnation, rather than recession, for the 15-member bloc.</p>",
  "<p>There was no shortage of excited reaction when Alistair Darling told Saturday's Guardian that economic conditions were \"arguably the most difficult in 60 years\". But the one audience he surely hoped would listen was the rate-setting committee of the Bank of England, whose passivity during the current slowdown is causing the first real rift with Whitehall since Bank independence. Yesterday, the committee again kept rates on hold. The chancellor's message, if that is what it was, had failed to get through.</p> <p>The decision came on the day the Halifax reported the biggest fall in house prices ever, and as we learned that the number of new cars sold this August was lower than it had been since 1966 - a time before the world had heard of Lovely Rita, when motoring was still a minority pursuit. If the announcement had come another day, some other indicator would have provided the grim backdrop instead. Whether it is business services, pub profits or computer store sales, as the autumn takes hold the bad figures in the morning news keep cropping up like mushrooms. </p> <p>The Bank is well aware that all economic compasses are now pointing south: one committee member, David Blanchflower, has been arguing for some time that the cost of borrowing must be cut aggressively to ameliorate the slump. But, until now at least, fears of stoking resurgent inflation - which is 4.4% and rising - have paralysed the majority of his colleagues. One of them, Charles Bean, has compared current dilemmas to those of the 1970s, and the Confederation of British Industry's surprisingly positive reaction to Bank inaction yesterday is another reflection of how the wage-price spiral of the glam rock years continues to haunt the economic establishment. This fear would be perfectly justified if wages were racing ahead, but when average pay rises are lagging behind living costs it borders on superstition. With oil prices in freefall the question is not if but when inflation will begin to decline.</p> <p>Central bankers, however, are a cautious bunch, and their narrow duty to target inflation makes them even less likely to take any risks. The 2% inflation target was supposed to encourage a balanced approach, as undershooting in a slump is treated as seriously as overshooting in a boom. Until recently, it worked well, but what has pushed prices up lately are global commodity markets over which the Bank has no control - all it can do, as it is doing, is offset their effect on prices by punishing the wider economy. </p> <p>The Bank's remit worked well until recently, but it is not doing so now. It was not discovered on tablets of stone, but written by Gordon Brown. It is time to revisit the remit again, and - if need be - to refine it.</p>",
  "<p>On August 22, the American Corn Growers Association endorsed Barack Obama for the presidency. It was only the second time in the group's 21-year history that it has endorsed a candidate for the White House. The corn growers <a href=\"http://www.acga.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=102&amp;Itemid=42\">said</a> they like Obama because he supports agriculture and \"the expansion of renewable energy such as advanced ethanol\" and other renewable sources.</p> <p>But don't expect to see any prominent mentions of that endorsement on BarackObama.com. Nor should you expect to hear Obama use the word \"ethanol\" between now and election day. Indeed, over the past few months, as the reports on corn ethanol's environmental and food price impacts have gone from bad to awful, Obama has been scurrying away from his record as one of the Senate's most reliable corn ethanol boosters. </p> <p>Over the past few weeks, the Obama campaign has refused to answer questions about Obama's support for the federal ethanol mandates, and the candidate's website has been purged of his old energy platform, which included several lines about his plans to increase ethanol production in the US. </p> <p>But try as they might, neither Obama nor his running mate, Joe Biden, can shake the smell of corn alcohol. And that may provide an opening for Obama's opponent, John McCain, who has long been one of the Senate's loudest ethanol critics. McCain briefly switched sides on ethanol in the months prior to the Iowa caucuses. But he is now one of a dozen Republican senators who are pushing <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/~hutchison/pr051908a.html\">a bill would freeze the volume of corn ethanol</a> to be blended into gasoline at no more than 9 billion gallons per year.</p> <p>In 2006, Obama, along with four other farm-state senators, sent a letter to President Bush urging him to ignore calls to reduce the $0.54 per-gallon tariff on imports of Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol. During his first year in office, Obama twice used corporate jets belonging to the Illinois-based agribusiness giant, Archer Daniels Midland Co, one of America's biggest ethanol producers. In January 2007, Obama along with two other farm-state senators, Tom Harkin, an Iowa Democrat, and Indiana Republican Richard Lugar, introduced a bill called the American Fuels Act of 2007, which was aimed at promoting ethanol consumption. Touting the bill, <a href=\"http://obama.senate.gov/press/070105-legislation_to_1/\">Obama said</a>: \"To become truly energy independent, we need not only to increase domestic production of renewable fuels like ethanol.\"</p> <p>Like Obama, Biden has long been a staunch ethanol booster. He has supported legislation aimed at requiring oil companies to retrofit their service stations with pumps capable of dispensing E85, a blend of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline, and legislation aimed at forcing automakers to produce cars capable of burning E85. Biden has <a href=\"http://biden.senate.gov/issues/issue/?id=0cc59be1-a50d-4e0f-952e-57931f6e4d62\">declared</a> that the US \"should increase the amount of ethanol and biodiesel included in the nation's fuel supply by extending and increasing\" the federal mandates that require American refiners to add ethanol to their gasoline. (Under current federal rules, US oil refiners must be using at least 15bn gallons of ethanol per year in their gasoline by 2015. Nearly all of that will be made from corn.) </p> <p>The huge increases in corn ethanol production are affecting food prices. At least 10 studies have found that US corn ethanol production is affecting prices at the supermarket. An April 8 i<a href=\"http://image.theguardian.com/sys-files/Environment/documents/2008/07/10/Biofuels.PDF\">nternal report from the World Bank </a>said that the price surge \"was caused by a confluence of factors but the most important was the large increase in biofuels production in the US and EU.\" In mid-July, Consumer Price Index data showed that over the previous three months, US food prices increased at an annualized rate if 8% - one of the biggest increases in recent history. </p> <p>Clean air advocates contend that the increasing use of ethanol in gasoline is increasing the amount of smog in America's cities. A spate of studies has shown that the production of corn ethanol likely creates more greenhouse gases than conventional gasoline.</p> <p>For Obama, fighting corn ethanol would mean cutting subsidies to corn farmers in his home state. In 2006 alone, according to data from the <a href=\"http://farm.ewg.org/farm/progdetail.php?fips=00000&amp;yr=2006&amp;progcode=corn&amp;page=states\">Environmental Working Group</a>, Illinois farmers received corn subsidies totalling $752.4m, making Illinois second only to Iowa in total federal corn handouts. And <a href=\"http://www.neo.ne.gov/statshtml/121.htm\">Illinois ranks third</a> among the states in ethanol production capacity, behind only Iowa and Nebraska.</p> <p>Taking \"change\" to Washington - the Obama campaign's mantra - will require fighting agriculture subsidies. But Obama voted for this year's farm bill, a $307bn package stuffed with yet more subsidies. Between 1995 and 2006, federal corn subsidies, which are provided through a myriad of programmes, totalled $56.1bn. That's <a href=\"http://farm.ewg.org/farm/region.php?fips=00000#topprogs\">more than twice the amount</a> given to any other agricultural commodity, including American mainstays like wheat and cotton, and 105 times more than was paid to tobacco farmers.</p> <p>Over the past few months, Obama has repeatedly worked to paint McCain, who favours more domestic drilling for oil and gas, as a handmaiden of Big Oil. That's an interesting charge given that Obama has spent much of his tenure in the Senate carrying water for Big Corn.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown signalled tonight that there would be no one-off payment to soften the impact of rising fuel bills in a package of measures expected to be released next week. But in a speech to the Scottish CBI, he sought to lift the gloom surrounding the wider economy, saying he was cautiously optimistic that underlying strengths would help Britain weather the global crisis. </p> <p>Ministers had considered a direct payment to ease the impact of the rising fuel costs. But the package will instead centre on extra financial help from electricity producers to pay for home efficiency measures, targeted at low-income households. Brown is still hoping to tout the programme as worth \u00a31bn, But Downing Street is concerned that the package will disappoint Labour backbenchers eager to see a big windfall tax on the electricity firms.</p> <p>Brown said he was working up proposals with the utility companies. He told the Scottish CBI: \"Not short-term gimmicks, or giveaways, but firm steps towards making every home in Britain more energy efficient, thus reducing bills not just temporarily, but permanently. You cannot address a long-term problem \u2014 the supply and demand for oil \u2014 with a short-term gimmick.\"</p> <p>Government sources said all the additional direct government help to soften the impact of fuel bills had already been set out in the March budget when increases in the winter fuel allowance had been announced.</p> <p>Ministers are instead focusing on extracting extra funding from the energy companies for the carbon emissions reduction target programme, a \u00a31.5bn, three-year obligation on energy suppliers to install home-based energy efficiency measures for people on low incomes, those with disabilities and those aged over 70. But talks with the energy firms are incomplete. </p> <p>Richard Lambert, the CBI director general, warned against a windfall tax, saying the worst way to assist the fuel-poor \"would be to impose an arbitrary and unfair tax on the energy industry, just at a moment when we want those same companies to be preparing for vastly increased investment in our energy infrastructure\". But the Local Government Association claimed the big six electricity producers had boosted dividend payments to shareholders by \u00a3257m over the last year, suggesting they were not ploughing their profits into investment. </p> <p>Brown said he was \"cautiously optimistic about the long-term resilience and underlying strengths of the British economy.\" He said: \"At root our economy is better placed to weather any global economic storm than it was the 70s, 80s or early 90s\". </p> <p>After chancellor Alistair Darling's more gloomy forecasts in his recent Guardian interview, Brown said he rested his cautious optimism on continued historically low interest rates, subdued wage pressures, fast-growing productivity, continued low levels of public debt as a proportion of national income, and the \"most robust independent competition regime anywhere in the world\". The government would not let down hard-working families on modest and middle income families: \"We will ensure that no one who is prepared to work hard and adapt to change will lose out as a result of global forces.\"</p> <p>But Britain could not pull up the drawbridge, or be immunised against the first great financial crisis of the global age, a crisis allied to a \"global credit crunch and global rises in commodity prices\". </p> <p>The shadow chancellor, George Osborne, said: \"The prime minister is in denial about both the crisis of confidence in his leadership and the economic crisis facing the country. His speech is totally at odds with the bleak assessment given by his chancellor just five days ago. </p> <p>\"At a time when Britain needs strong and united leadership with a clear sense of direction, we have a Labour government descending into civil war and a chancellor and a prime minister who publicly disagree on the severity of the problems we face.\"</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordonbrown\">Gordon Brown</a> launched <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">Labour</a>'s campaign to retain its crucial seat in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/glenrothes\">Glenrothes</a> with a bitter attack on Scottish nationalism and a warning that Fife could lose thousands of jobs if Scotland became independent.</p> <p>Speaking to Scottish business leaders, the prime minister accused the Scottish National party of \"self indulgent posturing\" by ignoring the fact the modern world was increasingly interdependent and Scotland heavily reliant on the UK economy.</p> <p>In a clear bid to wrong-foot the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/snp\">SNP</a>, which is clear favourite to win the Glenrothes byelection, he signalled he would back growing calls for the Scottish parliament to have greater financial freedom and accountability.</p> <p>In a riposte to complaints about Holyrood's restricted financial powers by the SNP leader, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/alexsalmond\">Alex Salmond</a>, Brown implied they would be increased</p> <p>\"The Scottish parliament is wholly accountable for the budget it spends but not for the size of its budget. And that budget it not linked to the success of the Scottish economy.\" </p> <p>Brown admitted this was a \"critical\" part of the remit for Sir Kenneth Calman's commission into enhanced powers for Holyrood. This is a significant concession to Labour, Liberal Democrat and Tory MSPs who are pressing for greater fiscal powers for Holyrood to neutralise demands for full independence. </p> <p>Implying that he expected even greater devolution of powers to Holyrood, Brown said there was now a \"modern case\" for devolution, based on partnership. He cited remarks by Olympic triple medal winner Chris Hoy that \"Scotland is part of Britain \u2013 they are not mutually exclusive. I wouldn't have three medals hanging round my neck if I wasn't part of the British team.\"</p> <p>He added: \"Be under no illusion about my purpose. Devolution is intended to preserve the unity of the United Kingdom \u2013 and developing devolution is intended to strengthen Scotland's place within it.\"<br> The prime minister devoted nearly a third of his CBI Scotland speech tonight to a detailed defence of the UK, outlining several of the key arguments Labour will use when the Glenrothes byelection campaign officially begins.</p> <p>Brown said the UK's significance to the area was underlined by the thousands of defence jobs being safeguarded at Rosyth dockyard from new Royal Navy aircraft carrier and frigate contracts from the Ministry of Defence.</p> <p>At the same time, Scotland's employment levels were now the best in the UK and among the best in Europe, while 10 years ago there were 200,000 fewer Scots in work. </p> <p>This was another example of the union dividend, through the UK government's employment programmes, he said.</p> <p>\"I believe there is a real risk of waking up one day to find that the many benefits of the union had been too long taken for granted and thoughtlessly thrown away,\" he warned.</p> <p>The collective strength of the UK through shared markets, economic power and wealth-creation would be replaced by a new border, increased business costs and bureaucracy, and legal and regulatory fragmentation. The SNP, he said, would make England a \"foreign country\".</p> <p>He went on: \"Set against the global challenges facing us today, the bleak separatist obsession of the nationalists to split Scotland from the rest of the UK looks at best like self-indulgent posturing. At worst like a wilful denial of the realities of the world we live in.\"</p> <p>Brown's attacks on Salmond's party reflect growing anxiety among SNP officials that the Glenrothes byelection is likely to be far tougher and bloodier for them than July's contest for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/glasgoweast\">Glasgow East</a>. </p> <p>While they require an achievable 14.5% swing in Glenrothes, against the 22% they achieved to win Glasgow East, they fear its proximity to Brown's neighbouring seat and its critical significance for his political survival means Labour will fight fiercely to retain it.</p> <p>Salmond's chief spokesman said Brown's new concessions were proof that the prime minister was desperately trying to stem the SNP's rise in popularity and influence in Scotland because he feared losing Glenrothes.<br> \"Only last year, Gordon Brown was rejecting all calls for any increase in the powers and responsibilities of the Scottish parliament,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Since then, we have had SNP success in the Scottish parliament election and in Glasgow East, and now Gordon Brown is singing a very different tune. <br> \"With the Glenrothes byelection around the corner, Gordon Brown is caving into pressure from the SNP and the people of Scotland.\"</p>",
  "<p>Today, several hundred nuclear industry executives will gather in London for the British-based World Nuclear Association's <a href=\"http://www.wna-symposium.org/prog08.html\">annual symposium</a>.</p> <p>A major session \u2013 The nuclear renaissance: redefining the global framework \u2013 chaired by Keith Parker, chief executive of the UK Nuclear Industry Association (NIA), will be devoted to the new opportunities expected as new nuclear build is back on the energy agenda, \"with a vengeance\", in the words of former prime minister Tony Blair.</p> <p>The session will explore how changes in the law affecting nuclear development has made it much more attractive for private financiers to commit their investment capital.</p> <p>Parker's NIA colleague, Tristram Denton (in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2008/aug/19/4\">a letter</a> to the Guardian on August 19), was right in stating that \"government has made it clear that the private sector will have to pay the full costs of any new nuclear power generation in the UK,\" but the government is not telling the full story. In two key nuclear expenditure areas, official, if obscure, statements have indicated that subsidies will continue.</p> <p>On the final day of the parliamentary session before recess this year, energy minister Malcolm Wicks told Labour backbencher Paul Flynn MP in <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080722/text/80722w0035.htm#08072397000068\">a written answer</a> that:</p> <blockquote> <p>Whilst the impact of any call on the proposed nuclear indemnity could be very high, there is only an extremely small possibility of the indemnity ever being used, and it is therefore not possible to put a meaningful financial value to the indemnity. The impossibility of quantifying the monetary value of the indemnity is the main reason that there is no commercially available insurance, and the reason an indemnity is needed.</p> </blockquote> <p>Flynn had asked what was the financial value of the insurance indemnity against claims deemed to be \"uninsurable\" to be granted to the successful bidder to manage Sellafield. In an earlier answer, Flynn <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080714/text/80714w0016.htm#column_76W\">was told</a> that ministers had:</p> <blockquote> <p>Been informed by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) that it expects to have to grant an indemnity against uninsurable claims arising from a nuclear incident that fall outside the protections offered by the Nuclear Installations Act and the Paris/Brussels convention.</p> </blockquote> <p>The issue is complex, but the only conclusion that can be drawn is that a significant taxpayer-funded insurance subsidy is being offered to the nuclear industry.</p> <p>Moreover, in the <a href=\"http://www.hse.gov.uk/nuclear/ocns/ocns0708.pdf\">latest annual report (pdf)</a> of the Office for Civil Nuclear Security (OCNS), quietly released on August 15, it records:</p> <blockquote> <p>The OCNS budget for this reporting period was \u00a32,481k. This total, and a charge for overhead and corporate costs of \u00a3665k, was recovered from the civil nuclear industry and from the DBERR as a charge for OCNS regulatory services.</p> </blockquote> <p>DBERR is the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. This means an unquantified taxpayer subsidy, through DBERR, also went to pay for part of the necessary security arrangements applied to commercial nuclear power.</p> <p>What about elsewhere? Much has been made by the nuclear industry of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/28/nuclear.energy?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=politics\">new reactor, Olkiluoto 3</a>, being built by French construction giant, Bouygues Travaux Publics, some 155 miles north west of Helsinki in Finland (next to two other reactors built in 1978 and 1980) as a model for the nuclear energy renaissance they would like to see develop globally. But the reactor has had serious problems in construction, with concrete and welding problems, as well as a serious fire, with the result that it is already two years behind schedule. This is bad news for the showcase 1,600 MW EPR (European pressurised prototype reactor), which is based on a design concept developed by nuclear giant Areva, a Franco-German consortium formed by Framatome ANP and Siemens. Olkiuoto 3's original budget of \u00a32.5bn has already overrun by an extra \u00a31bn.</p> <p>But who is paying this ever-growing bill? Details released so far suggest that the reactor is being supported by a unique financing package. In January 2006, energy investment analyst Hugo Peek (head of power and utilities at ABN Amro) described its components thus:</p> <blockquote> <p>Syndicated loan of \u20ac1.95bn signed December 2003:<br>\u0095 Bayerische Landesbank (BLB), BNP Paribas, Handelsbanken, JP Morgan and Nordea<br>\u0095 Euribor + 52.5-57.5bps<br>\u0095 Banks received 30bps for \u20ac150m <br>\u0095 In addition to the syndicated loan, bilateral loans worth \u20ac550m were negotiated, \u20ac1.6bn of the original facility refinanced in June 2005<br>\u0095 The deal was said to be oversubscribed, with an increase from the original target amount of \u20ac1.5bn<br>\u0095 MLAs were BayernLB, BTM, BNP Paribas (books), Nordea (books, docs) and SEB (books, facility agent)<br>Tenor is seven years, with pricing currently undisclosed.</p> </blockquote> <p>The BLB is a majority Bavarian state-owned bank, owned by the so-called free state (Freistaat Bayern). This is publicly backed investment, albeit from abroad.</p> <p>But just as in the UK, the Finish government insists the new reactor will be privately financed. \"The government neither builds nor funds the construction of nuclear power. The projects are implemented solely on <a href=\"http://www.finland.si/Public/default.aspx?contentid=130663&amp;nodeid=35025&amp;culture=en-US\">a commercial basis</a>,\" says Riku Huttunen, deputy director general at Finland's ministry of employment and the economy. </p> <p>And at a <a href=\"http://www.paavolipponen.org/cgi-bin/puheet.php?key=343\">global financing summit</a> for new nuclear plants, in Paris in June 2006, Paavo Lipponen, former speaker of the Finnish parliament, who, as prime minister, laid the foundation stone for Olkiluoto 3, said: </p> <blockquote> <p>To finance for the new unit being built in Olkiluoto the owners pay 20% equity capital and grant a loan on equity terms covering another 5%. The remaining 75% has been obtained from international finance markets through a tendering process. TVO received several offers from financial institutions and, thanks to stiff competition, the loan terms are favourable. The Olkiluoto 3 project has not received public aid from the Finnish state, either in the form of guarantees or grants.</p> </blockquote> <p> <br>But what some digging around establishes is that the French export credit agency <a href=\"http://www.coface.com/\">Coface</a>, has provided loans of \u20ac610m in \"export\" credit guarantees for Olkiluoto 3 to TVO, loans which also assist Areva. Additionally, Svensk Exportkredit, the Swedish export credit organisation, has provided 110m Swedish crowns (\u20ac1m). So two foreign states are providing effective publicly financed support. Lauri Myllyvirta of <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org/finland/\">Greenpeace Finland</a> has confirmed this week that both Greenpeace and the <a href=\"http://www.eref-europe.org\">European Renewable Energies Federation</a> are appealing to the European court of justice on the European commission ruling that these export credits do not count as state aids. </p> <p>Other investors include power company TVO, whose investors include Fortum and Pohjolan Voima Oy (PVO), Finland's second-biggest energy company, plus forestry and paper giants <a href=\"http://w3.upm-kymmene.com/\">UPM Kymmene</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.storaenso.com/Pages/default.aspx\">Stora Enso</a>. In addition, a host of publicly owned municipal energy companies have invested. </p> <p>The French finance magazine Capital claimed in May that Areva could be obliged to pay \u20ac2.2bn in penalties to Olkiluoto 3's owners, Finnish power generator Teollisuuden Voima Oyj (TVO) for delays in the construction of the plant, an assertion swiftly denied by Areva. </p> <p>Back in Britain, in the September edition of <a href=\"http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=10336\">Prospect</a>, Tom Burke, formerly executive director at Friends of the Earth, pens a excoriating critique of the optimism of the nuclear sector that an atomic renaissance is within their grasp. He wrote:</p> <blockquote> <p>The government has pledged that there will be no subsidies for new nuclear construction. But this was never credible, and it is already possible to detect signs of retreat. In 2006 the government bravely promised to 'make sure that the full costs of new nuclear waste are paid by the market'. By 2008 this had mutated into the more nuanced: 'The government will [set] a fixed unit price [for] waste disposal at the time when approvals for the station are given.' This effectively caps the costs of nuclear waste disposal to the operator and transfers the risk of cost overruns on to the taxpayer.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Burke concludes: \"It is hard to argue that this is not a subsidy.\"</p> <p>It is hard to disagree. So nuclear critics, such as CND's Kate Hudson, are correct to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/aug/16/letters\">assert that</a> nuclear subsidies do indeed exist.</p>",
  "<p>If Obama's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/29/barackobama.democrats20081\">convention speech</a>, with the white columns in the huge stadium was grand opera, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/04/uselections2008.sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin's was soap opera</a>. The message was not that we should overlook her inexperience, but rejoice in it. We should vote for her because she was a hockey mom. The content of her speech was dumbed down in a way that was exquisitely handcrafted.</p> <p>In the hall, the audience was festooned with folksy placards handcrafted by the same sophisticated but ultimately stupid whiz-kids who put the <a href=\"http://bastardlogic.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/mission-accomplished.jpg\">Mission Accomplished banner</a> on the USS Lincoln five long years ago. The crowd is different, however. At a Republican convention there is always an undercurrent of bitterness and anger, a readiness to boo at the mention of, for example, community organising, or Senate democratic majority leader Harry Reid, or chant \"<a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2008/09/03/steele-gives-gop-delegates-new-cheer-drill-baby-drill/?mod=googlenews_wsj\">Drill baby, drill</a>\", as the crowd offers to drive their gas-guzzlers over all obstacles.</p> <p>Of course, the crowd had been primed for bitterness by none other than New York's own Napoleon, the bitter and vicious Rudy Giuliani who always gives the impression of payback time for perennial bullying in his schoolboy days. However, any crowd that cheers Giuliani for celebrating McCain's response to Putin's Cossack raid into Georgia, \"We are all Georgians,\" is not up for cerebration. Whose big talking got the Georgians into that predicament? And is McCain in a refugee camp with Russian tanks stopping him from moving about his own country?</p> <p>Technically, Palin's speech was not a patch on Obama's. I ran it past the reading level test on the spell checker. His had come in at a reading level of fourth grade, with no passives. Hers was a reading level of over ninth grade with six per cent of passives. Strangely, although she was clearly intended to evoke the solidarity votes of small town America, her speech writers, Bush's hand-me-downs, were worried about her pronunciation, and spelt out some difficult words for her on the teleprompter: \"habber-dasher\" for haberdasher, \"new-clear\" for nuclear to avert the Bushian \"noocoolear.\"</p> <p>However, even if the style was higher than Obama's, the content was not. It was aimed at people of faith, who could believe in three impossible things before breakfast. Her speechwriter <a href=\"http://www.matthewscully.com/\">Matthew Scully</a> wrote a book about the ethical treatment of animals, which is perhaps why his residual ethics eschewed any mention of shooting wolves from aircraft that may have sullied the hockey mum image. Nor indeed did he mention that her enthusiasm for hockey led her to <a href=\"http://current.com/items/89268486_as_mayor_hard_core_fiscal_conservative_sarah_palin_left_wasilla_20_million_in_debt\">increase the local sales tax</a> \u2013 including on food \u2013 to build an ice-hockey stadium so that her son could indulge his passion closer to home.</p> <p>The speech was almost certainly inspired by <a href=\"http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/H._L._Mencken\">HL Mencken</a>'s thought: \"On some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their heart's desire at last, and the White House will be adorned by a downright moron\". But that is unfair. Both she and her speechwriters are very clever, and unscrupulous, and they want to make her fit that role. They are basing their campaign on the premise that the American electorate wants a president on the edge of Alzheimer's and a vice-president who is auditioning for a part in a schmaltzy soap opera.</p> <p>She mentioned, to cheers that her husband was a proud member of the United Steelworkers Union, she glided over pathological Republican attempts to crush unions, and inhibit their organising efforts. But then, nor did she mention her <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1837918,00.html\">run-in with the town librarian</a> (surely along with the little red school house, an American icon) over censorship, her attempts to promote creationism, her belief that God wants federal funding for Alaskan pipelines, her doubts about global warming, or her pursuit of personal family feuds against public employees. This is a serious omission, and almost perplexing since it could prove that she may indeed be a worthy successor to Dick Cheney as a vice-president, and indeed a better shot, hitting wolves rather than colleagues. But then, Cheney wasn't mentioned either.</p> <p>Her balancing budgets may have been helped by a $1,000 per head per annum pork-barrelling operation from federal funds for her small town, helped by <a href=\"http://www.adn.com/news/politics/fbi/stevens/story/499537.html\">Senator Ted Stevens</a>, one of the \"good ol' boys\" she was supposed to have cleaned out, but who is currently campaigning for re-election even as he faces Federal corruption charges.</p> <p>She complained that Obama did not mention victory. But if pressed, she might have to explain why diverting troops from the search for Bin Laden in Afghanistan to Iraq and bogging down in both places occasioned mention for victory. Almost as eloquent in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/04/uselections2008.georgebush\">deafening sound of silence was any reference to President Bush,</a> which is surely churlish. The USA has had eight years of the policies she was prescribing \u2013 and is teetering on the edge of an economic catastrophe, but she just ignored it.</p> <p>Polls suggest that the American public oppose almost every one of Palin's concealed policies. This speech casts the forthcoming telection as an IQ test for the American electorate. If it fails, I foresee long lines outside Canadian and European consulates as the elite (anyone with an IQ over a 100) tries to get out.</p>",
  "<p>A British Airways plane that crashed at Heathrow airport in January was probably brought down by a freak build-up of ice that blocked the fuel supply to its engines, air accident investigators said today.</p> <p>The British Air Accidents Investigation Branch said authorities in Europe and the US should act immediately and impose interim safety measures on all Boeing 777 aircraft.</p> <p>The dramatic crash of flight BA038 was probably caused by a sudden restriction in the aircraft's fuel supply, the AAIB said today, following an \"unusual\" combination of factors during the flight from Beijing to Heathrow.</p> <p>Today's AAIB interim report makes three recommendations: </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> That Boeing and engine maker Rolls-Royce impose interim measures to reduce the risk of ice forming in aviation fuel in some Boeing 777s.<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> That aviation watchdogs in the US and European Union investigate the threat to other makes of aircraft and engines.<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> And that US and EU authorities review safety requirements for aircraft engines.</p> <p>One expert said aircraft on long-haul journeys may have to fly at lower altitudes until the definitive cause of the crash is discovered. </p> <p>Kieran Daly, group editor of Air Transport Intelligence, said: \"This report indicates that the conventional wisdom in the industry regarding the potential for ice to form in fuel systems on long-haul flights may well be incorrect. There could be circumstances where the aircraft has to fly at a lower altitude.\"</p> <p>He added that the Boeing 777 would not be the only aircraft affected: \"The AAIB is saying that, for all we know there could be a problem with essentially any long-haul aircraft.\" </p> <p>The report also suggested that the problem could be solved by introducing an anti-icing device used by the military which could prevent a similar incident happening again.</p> <p>However, the report stressed the unusual circumstances behind the crash: \"This is the first known occurrence of this nature in any large modern transport aircraft.\" </p> <p>The AAIB said a number of factors probably conspired to bring down BA038 several hundred metres short of Heathrow's south runway at 12.43pm on January 17. </p> <p>In the report, investigators said thrust in both the aircraft's engines probably failed because water in the fuel had frozen at altitude, possibly during unusually cold conditions over Siberia, and formed small ice crystals that were released as the plane landed - blocking fuel supply to the engines.</p> <p>The AAIB said: \"The investigation has shown that the fuel flow to both engines was restricted - most probably due to ice within the fuel feed system. This ice is likely to have formed from water that occurred naturally in the fuel whilst the aircraft operated for a long period, with low fuel flows, in an unusually cold environment.\" </p> <p>Investigators said three unique factors came together in flight BA038 that had not been found in 13,000 other flights: the length of time that fuel temperatures stayed below 0\u00b0C; low fuel flow demands in cruising flight; and high fuel flow demands during landing. They added that the amount of water in the fuel supply - around five litres - was not abnormal.</p> <p>Boeing said it had devised \"a number of operational changes\" to prevent ice building up in 777 fuel systems that used the type of Rolls-Royce engine involved in the crash. The National Transportation Safety Board in Washington said it supported the AAIB recommendations.</p> <p>Flight BA038 struck the grassy approach to Heathrow's south runway, crushing its undercarriage - which became detached - and skidding on its belly for several hundred metres. The engines, wings and tail fin of the aircraft were badly damaged by the impact.</p> <p>The 136 passengers and 16 crew on board were evacuated from the plane on emergency slides. One passenger suffered a broken leg in the crash-landing and eight others had minor injuries.</p> <p>The senior first officer of the flight, John Coward, 41, was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/04/britishairways.theairlineindustry\">hailed as a hero</a> for steering the jet over the airport fence and on to the ground just short of the runway.</p>",
  "<p>It will take some time for the implications of the conflict between Georgia and Russia to be truly understood. Between the unfolding facts on the ground and the flurry of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/27/russia.georgia\">diplomatic activity</a> in <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/09/03/europe/EU-EU-Parliament-Georgia.php\">the EU</a> and by <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7597336.stm\">the US</a>, there is an impression of developments and change \u2013 but these can only be seen as short term, since the issues at the heart of this situation are far broader than a specific border or state. Indeed, they encompass the very meaning of the international system, and especially the interpretation of international law. Neither an emergency <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKL236403420080902\">EU summit</a> nor a visit by US vice-president <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2008/sep/04/georgia.russia\">Dick Cheney</a> to the region will address these, nor will bellicose declarations by Russia. And since the UN is effectively neutralised, due to Russia's refusal to allow a debate on the Georgian conflict, it is unclear when a proper consideration of these core issues can even begin to take place.</p> <p>While any attempt to reduce this debate to simple propositions will do none justice, for the purposes of clarity it is possible to suggest that the western approach holds international law as an absolute arbiter on all issues, both between states and within them. In other words, it is there for state, peoples and individuals alike \u2013 and it tends to attempt to uphold the rights of all three, though in reality it usually comes down firmly on behalf of the state, and so by default sanctifying the integrity of states and international borders, while accepting alterations, such as in the case of Kosovo. Russia, China and other non-democratic regimes see the issue entirely differently. For them international law is solely about the interaction of states: its viability and jurisdiction stops at a state border and national law reigns supreme within any state. The individual, and a people, are therefore beyond the scope of international law within this approach, while territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders are enshrined \u2013 with no exceptions. Within this reading, Kosovo is an unacceptable heresy, to be ruthlessly stamped out.</p> <p>Kosovo keeps coming up because it has become the nub of the Georgian conflict \u2013 which only underlines the need for a far more fundamental debate. And while the west adamantly refutes any comparison between the two, Russia is equally adamant it has served as a precedent for its own actions. Neither side is correct.</p> <p>Within the western perspective, the liberation of Kosovo from Serbia \u2013 starting from a lengthy bombing campaign in 1999, followed by a UN administration of a de facto separate Kosovo, and ending with its self-declared independence \u2013 was a necessity driven by Serbia's systematic abuse of the Albanian majority in Kosovo. As such, it has been defined as a \"unique case\" rather than a precedent in international law, since the circumstances were deemed to be sui generic, not least because the Kosovo issue could be seen as the last unresolved part of the long wars of Yugoslav secession. In truth, this perspective is at best flawed \u2013 there was unfortunately remarkably little that was unique about the circumstances of Kosovo, in which Milosevic let his forces loose upon unprotected civilians: another unchecked despot, whose crimes and misdemeanours were awful but never plumbed the depths of a Mugabe or the Burmese junta, to mention just two of the current cast. What was unique was the guilt of the west over the Yugoslav wars, and especially the Srebrenica massacre \u2013 and the need to assuage it with a large gesture. Moreover, the fact that the west has adamantly refused to act over other despots who decimate their own populations has definitely underlined its belief that Kosovo was unique, and its lack of intention in repeating the move.</p> <p>From the Russian perspective, the 1999 Nato bombing of Kosovo \u2013 and ultimately Serbia \u2013 was unacceptable on two counts: first, it was illegal, since all the action was undertaken without a UN security council resolution. Second, it was a violation of the two issues of international law Russia considers most crucial: absolute acceptance of international borders and territorial integrity; and the inapplicability of international law within a nation state. Within this reading Kosovo was recognised as part of Serbia, and there it had to stay \u2013 while the international community was not at liberty to intervene in the affairs of another state, even if it was persecuting its citizens. To make matters worse, little recognition was given to Russia's crucial role in delivering a halt to the bombing in 1999: working through the OSCE, it was Russia that brought Serbia to the table rather than <a href=\"http://www.kommersant.com/p741721/r_1/US_Kosovo_Frank_Wisner/\">Maarti Ahtisaari</a>, though the west has always given all credit to the latter. And while Russia was party to security council resolution 1244, which gave Kosovo de facto independence under a UN administration, Russia always maintained that it was unacceptable for it to become independent de jure, since this would be a violation of international law. It has therefore refused to recognise an independent Kosovo, and <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/67abec7c-6cba-11dd-96dc-0000779fd18c.html\">blocked any attempt</a> to address the matter in the security council over the past <a href=\"http://africa.reuters.com/wire/news/usnN28360832.html\">six months</a>.</p> <p>The Russian invasion of Georgia, and its decision to keep a presence within that state in violation of its signature upon the ceasefire agreement brokered by France, undermines its own argument about respecting territorial integrity and international law. If it had stuck with South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which are recognised internationally as part of Georgia, it would have been on sticky ground \u2013 but it could still have claimed to have done no more nor less than the west did in Kosovo, including its unilateral recognition of the two regions' independence. It would have been a tenuous proposition, but nonetheless one far more difficult to counter in the west than the one currently maintained by Russia. For by entering Georgia proper, destroying its military infrastructure, and now declaring its democratically elected ruler a \"<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/03/world/europe/03russia.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;oref=slogin\">political corpse</a>\" as in one who cannot be dealt with, Russia has basically shown its intentions have little bearing on asserting international law. </p> <p>The west, on the other hand, must stop pretending Kosovo was anything but a dangerous precedent in international law and the viability of the international system. It is. And if it becomes possible to twist out of the current situation due to Russia's excesses \u2013 it will no doubt happen again, somewhere else. Maybe the Kurds, or the Transnistrians, or the Chechens \u2013 the world is full of peoples who want to shake off unacceptable rule and become independent states. Ironically, Georgia, much like many other former Soviet states, was deeply worried about the precedent of Kosovo before it took place, fearing the South Ossetians and the Abkhazians would use it to break away and declare independence \u2013 a move that would have been difficult to counter in the international community. In the event, by Russia taking the step \u2013 or rather several steps too far \u2013 the two regions have lost the opportunity.</p>",
  "<p>Tory candidate and millionaire environmentalist Zac Goldsmith today accused the government of a \"staggering mismatch\" between what it says and what it does about climate change. He was appearing for the defence in the trial of six activists who scaled a 200m coal-fired power station and daubed the word \"Gordon\" on its chimney in October 2007.</p> <p>Greenpeace does not deny causing \u00a330,000 of damage to the smokestack of Kingsnorth power station in Kent, but argues that its members were trying to prevent a greater crime taking place. The prosecution has claimed that the group went well beyond acceptable protest.</p> <p>Goldsmith, the former editor of The Ecologist magazine who resigned last year to advise the Tory party and become prospective parliamentary candidate for Richmond west, told the jury at Maidstone crown court that direct action could be justified. \"Legalities aside, I suppose if a crime is intended to prevent much larger crimes, I think then a lot of people would consider that as justified,\" he said.</p> <p>\"My view is that by building a coal-power plant in this country, it makes it very much harder in exerting pressure on countries like China and India. I think that's something that is felt in government circles.\"</p> <p>Goldsmith said that while the government had publicly acknowledged the environment as a \"pressing issue\" it has consistently proposed policies that made environmental problems worse, such as trebling airport capacity and planning a new power station for Kingsnorth. \"I think there has been a staggering mismatch from what we have seen from government in terms of policy and action.\" </p> <p>Goldsmith said he did not think the government was \"knowingly embarking on a crime,\" but accused it of lacking imagination in exploring alternatives. </p> <p>On Wednesday, leading US climate change scientist Professor James Hansen gave evidence at Maidstone and called for a moratorium on the building of new coal-fired power stations in order to prevent runaway climate change. He estimated that Kingsnorth, which emits 20,000 tonnes of C02 a day, would be responsible for the extinction of 400 species. </p> <p>Inuit leader Aqqaluk Lynge will give evidence for Greenpeace via videolink from Greenland tomorrow. </p> <p>The defendants who scaled the chimney include Huw Williams, 41, from Nottingham; Ben Stewart, 34, from Lyminge, Kent; Kevin Drake, 44, from Westbury, Wiltshire; Will Rose, 29, from London; and Emily Hall, 34, from New Zealand. They are all charged with criminal damage. </p> <p>Tim Hewke, 48, from Ulcombe, Kent, who the prosecution says helped organise the protest from the ground, is also charged with criminal damage. </p> <p>The defendants maintain that they were lawfully right to damage Kingsnorth power station, as they believed doing so would prevent further damage to properties around the world by global warming. </p> <p>The case continues.</p>",
  "<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337306573\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2008/09/04/UKTides.jpg\" alt=\"Tide map of UK\" width=\"220\" height=\"322\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">UK tides ... stronger tides are yellow and red. Image: DTI</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Harnessing the vast energy of the UK's coastal tides could become much simpler and cheaper with a new design for the next generation of underwater turbines. The device, unveiled by a team of engineers from Oxford University, re-thinks the way power is generated underwater and the inventors believe it will be more robust, more efficient and cheaper to build and maintain than anything in operation today.</p> <p>There is an immense potential resource of clean energy from the tidal flows around the UK: conservative estimates suggest there is at least five gigawatts of power, but there could be as much as 15GW, equivalent to 15 million average family homes. Tidal generators can harvest the energy of these moving streams, with the added advantage that the resource is, unlike wind, predictable. </p> <p>There are only a few underwater turbines in operation today and they all operate like underwater windmills, with their blades turning at right angles to the flow of the water. In contrast, the Oxford team's device is built around a cylindrical rotor, which rolls around its long axis as the tide ebbs and flows. As a result, it can use more of the incoming water than a standard underwater windmill. </p> <p>At full size, a Transverse Horizontal Axis Water Turbine (Thawt) rotor would be 10m in diameter and 60m long. Connecting two of these together with a generator in the middle could produce around 12MW of power, enough for 12,000 average family homes. </p> <p>\"To do that, you only need three foundations and one generator,\" said Martin Oldfield, senior research fellow of engineering science at Oxford University. \"To do that with a [windmill] would require five foundations and 10 generators.\"</p> <p>The Thawt device is mechanically far less complicated than anything available today, meaning it would cost less to build and maintain. \"The manufacturing costs are about 60% lower, the maintenance costs are about 40% lower,\" said Malcolm McCulloch, head of the electrical power group at Oxford's engineering department. </p> <p>So far, the researchers have successfully tested a version of Thawt that is 1m in diameter and 6m long. They are now planning to build a 5m-diameter test device that could generate electricity for the grid. By 2009 the team wants to carry out sea trials to test the device's durability in open water. </p> <p>Scaling up the power at a coastal site would involve connecting together a series of Thawt rotors across the sea floor. The engineers said that, if all went well, farms of Thawt devices could be built starting around 2013. \"If you have a tidal site of 20km, you could build 20km of these turbines going across [the sea floor] and then you would be into the gigawatt class,\" said Oldfield. This would make the farm equivalent to a small coal-fired power station.</p> <p>McCulloch said that their economic analysis of the Thawt device showed that, at farm scale, the Thawt devices could be installed at around \u00a31.7m per MW. That compares with around \u00a33m per MW for modern marine turbine technology and just over \u00a32m per MW for wind power. </p> <p>Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace said the UK is a potential global leader in wave power. But he noted: \"Many good ideas for wave power generation suffer from a lack of finance, lack of assured market and lack of access to business expertise. </p> <p>\"Some of these bottlenecks need to be addressed by the industry - others need government to play a boosting role rather than hoping that the rules and organisations that got us into the climate problem are going to be the ones that get us out.\" </p> <p>In July, Bristol-based company Marine Current Turbines installed the SeaGen device, an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/jul/17/waveandtidalpower.renewableenergy\">underwater windmill device</a>, at Strangford Lough in Northern Ireland. It is the first commercial-scale tidal device to generate power for the grid. When it is eventually running at full power, MCT said it will have an output of 1,200 kW, enough for about 1,000 homes.</p> <p>\"There are presently tidal devices undergoing testing \u2013 we regard those as first generation device and we regard ours as a second generation,\" said Oldfield. \"To some extent we admire them for being pioneers of the technology but we think what we've got will end up being better.\"</p> <p>Steph Merry, head of marine renewable energy at the Renewable Energy Association welcomed the Oxford team's work but said that, in terms of backing a technology to harness tide power, nothing can be ruled in or out. \"We've got this 15% renewables target for 2020 to achieve, which equates to 40% electricity, so you have to look at all possible options of generating it.\"</p> <p>Merry added that, technology aside, there were other stumbling blocks in building tidal projects around the UK, including what she sees as an excessive need to monitor the environmental impact of turbines. \"We have to get it in proportion, you can't have an unlimited budget for environmental monitoring when every engineering company has to work to a budget for any project. At the moment, there is no limit to the monitoring that can be imposed.\" </p> <p>She said that the industry had to sit down with environmental groups and government to find a balance between the need to tackle climate change and the requirements to safeguard the ecology of tidal areas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337317807\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2008/09/04/Tidal_0509_02.jpg\" alt=\"Tidal_0509\" width=\"460\" height=\"503\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tidal_0509</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>&#xa0;</p>",
  "<p>This morning, the full scale of Boris Johnson's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/04/london.boris\">above-inflation transport fare rises</a> was revealed. The figures show some very painful price increases for large numbers of Londoners, most notably an 11% increase in the price of a single bus journey on Oyster \u2013 up from 90p to \u00a31. David Cameron's attempts to portray his party as kinder and gentler won't be helped by that, or by the 10% increase in tube fares for children aged 11 to 15. </p> <p>The Tories do not seem to have learned that fares policy can be as defining and sensitive for London government as taxation is for central government. Londoners in their millions feel the consequences. </p> <p>The new mayor blames the steep rise in fares on his predecessor, claiming a black hole in Transport for London's finances. Like a broken record, the Tories always claim a black hole in the TfL finances. It has always has been drivel. The truth is that Ken Livingstone's budgets were balanced and had to be; not least because he could not risk any negative impact on his administration's credit rating. </p> <p>When Livingstone was elected as London's mayor in 2000 the capital was struggling with the legacy of years of under-investment in the city's infrastructure. The Conservatives had imposed an ideologically driven policy of leaving London's problems to the market to sort out. Unfortunately for London, the market did not oblige. In transport, as in each area of policy where London's interests had been neglected, the Livingstone administration invested in order to end the era of Tory neglect.</p> <p>Alongside this investment the introduction of radical concessionary fares schemes \u2013 such as the abolition of bus and tram fares for all under-18s in full-time education, and half-price bus and tram journeys for people on income support \u2013 reduced the pressure on those most in need. The aim was to pass the benefits on to Londoners directly. He did this both through the concessions for the youngest and poorest but also, when it was possible to do so, and because of competent financial management of Transport for London, by cutting fares. A single bus fare was cut to 90p from \u00a31 and the price of a weekly bus pass was <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/view_press_release.jsp?releaseid=12395\">reduced</a>, and then fares were <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/view_press_release.jsp?releaseid=14274\">frozen</a>. </p> <p>Much-needed investment combined with a fairer policy for fares stood in contrast with years of painful fare increases in the late 1980s and 1990s when Londoners saw no benefit at all for their rising transport costs.</p> <p>Whatever the <a href=\"http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-mayor/article-23550946-details/Comment%3A+Ken's+toxic+fares+legacy/article.do\">protestations</a>, the buck for the mayor's new fares policy stops fairly and squarely with the mayor. The wasteful decisions taken this summer have led to today's announcement. London has lost between \u00a330m and \u00a350m a year by abandoning the \u00a325-a-day charge on gas guzzlers in the congestion charge zone; the mutually beneficial cheap oil deal with Venezuela has been terminated, costing London \u00a316m a year; and yet more may be thrown down the plughole with the expensive consultation on ending or watering down the western extension of the congestion charge. </p> <p>These costs exclude the potential damage to TfL's finances of the plan to introduce a new 'Routemaster' bus, which <a href=\"http://taspublications.co.uk/blog/?p=17\">independent analysis</a> during the mayoral election showed would cost more than \u00a3100m a year. During that election, Labour argued that the choice between Ken Livingstone and Boris Johnson included a <a href=\"http://ken.3cdn.net/24af84f711f525a526_k4m6bksjs.pdf\">choice on fares (pdf)</a> \u2013 that the Tories' costly plan to introduce a new 'Routemaster' bus alone would equal an <a href=\"http://ken.bluestatedigital.com/media/johnson_minimum_15_bus_fares_increase\">increase</a> in the cost of a single bus journey from 90p to \u00a31.05.</p> <p>Yet even close observers of that election may find themselves taken aback that with today's announcement bus fares will hit the \u00a31 mark as early as January, before the work has even begun in earnest on the new \"Routemaster\". </p> <p>It says a lot about the modern Conservative party's priorities for both transport and the environment that the first fares package in London imposed under Tory rule for 12 years wallops the ordinary passenger, while leaving owners of gas-guzzlers safe from paying a \u00a325 CO2 congestion charge.</p>",
  "<p>Sales of new cars in the UK slumped by almost a fifth last month to produce the worst August for the industry since 1966.</p> <p>Top marques were among those hardest hit, with sales of BMWs down almost 40% compared with the same month in 2007, Jaguar down 41%, Land Rover almost 58% lower and Mercedes-Benz recording a drop of 35%, according to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.</p> <p>Sales of small cars held up better, with cars such as the Vauxhall Corsa (the month's top seller), the Ford Fiesta and the Mini increasing that segment's share of the market from just under 30% to almost 34%. </p> <p>Sales in the mini segment - usually cars with two doors and engines of less than one litre - increased, doubling the sector's market share.<br> The move towards smaller, more fuel-efficient cars suggests that buyers are becoming meaner and greener in the face of the economic slowdown.</p> <p>New car sales so far this year are down 3.8% overall but have fallen by more than 10% over the past three months.</p> <p>Commenting on the 18.6% fall in new car registrations in August, Paul Everitt, the chief executive of the SMMT, said: \"August is one of the quietest months for the new car market but this year was the lowest since 1966 with only 63,225 registrations. The slowdown mirrors the difficult conditions being experienced across the main European markets.</p> <p>\"The industry is encouraged by the growing interest in lower carbon cars but is concerned by the reluctance of consumers to commit to major purchases. There is a clear need for sustained action by government to boost the economy and restore confidence.\"</p> <p>The SMMT said it expected sales to fall by around 10% - some 85,000 vehicles - over the final four months of the year. It has cut its forecast for sales in 2008 from 2.31 million to 2.26 million and from 2.23 million to 2.16 million for 2009.</p> <p>Demand from private buyers continued to fall sharply - down by almost a quarter last month - as the impact of economic uncertainty continues to bite.</p> <p>Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at Global Insight, said: \"Sharply deteriorating car sales is a further clear sign that consumers are increasingly cutting back on their spending. </p> <p>\"Many consumers are doing this out of necessity due to squeezed purchasing power but it is also likely that many are retrenching out of choice, reflecting serious concerns about the economic situation and outlook.\"</p>",
  "<p>A British Airways plane that crashed on the runway at Heathrow airport in January was probably brought down by ice restricting the flow of fuel to the engines, the Air Accidents Investigations Branch has found.</p> <p>It has recommended that airlines introduce interim measures for all Boeing 777 aircraft to reduce the risk of another such accident. The AAIB found that the crash was \"the first known occurrence of this nature in any large modern transport aircraft\".</p> <p>Flight BA038 from Beijing struck the grassy approach to Heathrow's south runway at 12.43pm on January 17, crushing its undercarriage - which became detached - and skidding on its belly for several hundred metres. The engines, wings and tail fin of the aircraft were badly damaged by the impact.</p> <p>The 136 passengers and 16 crew on board were evacuated from the plane on emergency slides. One passenger suffered a broken leg in the crash-landing and eight others had minor injuries.</p> <p>The senior first officer of the flight, John Coward, 41, was hailed as a hero for steering the jet over the airport fence and on to the ground 300 metres short of the runway.</p> <p>Releasing its fifth report on the incident, the AAIB focused on the aircraft's fuel system. It concluded: \"The investigation has shown that the fuel flow to both engines was restricted - most probably due to ice within the fuel feed system. </p> <p>\"This ice is likely to have formed from water that occurred naturally in the fuel whilst the aircraft operated for a long period, with low fuel flows, in an unusually cold environment.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>The Economist</strong> is following <strong>The Sun</strong> by using street vendors to sell copies on London's streets. In a trial beginning tomorrow, the weekly-magazine-that-calls-itself-a-newspaper will be sold at various key points, notably in the City, at its normal cover price, \u00a33.90.</p> <p>The magazine wants to reach out to a new audience, but it's doing this from a position of strength because it has been enjoying sales increases in recent years. ABC figures released last month showed global year-on-year growth of 6% and a total worldwide circulation of 1,337,184, with UK sales also up 6% (to 182,539).</p> <p><strong>Yvonne Ossman</strong>, the magazine's UK publisher, says: \"The Economist is no longer a niche brand of the establishment and hasn't been for some time. Our readers are incredibly diverse and the characteristics that connect them are their curiosity, drive, optimism and energy.</p> <p>\"They are fascinated by the world around them and that makes The Economist more relevant now - for them and people like them - than ever. We hope that by putting people on the streets we will help unite our paper with more of the people it has been written for.\"</p> <p>OK, a lot of corporate speak there. But it will be interesting to see if the readership can be broadened by this initiative. Clearly, with a 6% year-on-year increase in British circulation, the magazine hasn't achieved its full sales potential yet.</p>",
  "<p>A series of Labour loyalists and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordonbrown\">Gordon Brown</a> supporters took to the airwaves today to criticise Charles Clarke for his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/04/labourleadership.labour\">comments about the prime minister</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/edballs\">Ed Balls</a>, the children's secretary, said Clarke's comments were unoriginal and irrelevant to the debate about the party's future.</p> <p>\"It's not the first time Charles has made those kind of comments. I think it's Charles being Charles,\" said Balls, one of Brown's closest allies.</p> <p>Speaking on GMTV, following the publication of <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/uk-politics/2008/09/labour-blair-british-current\">Clarke's New Statesman article</a> but before his Today programme interview, Balls went on: \"I don't think that's where the debate will be when we get to the next general election.</p> <p>\"If you go back to 1986 when the economy was in difficulty, there were people saying the same things about Margaret Thatcher but she went on to win the next election.</p> <p>\"What we've got to do is focus on the big issues and the real divides, and the real divide is going to be between Labour and Conservative on the big issues facing the future of our country.\"</p> <p>Nigel Griffiths, another ally of Brown's and a former minister, accused Clarke of diverting attention away from \"all the positive things\" the Labour government was doing\".</p> <p>Griffiths told the Today programme: \"It is not as if Charles has any alternative policies. Charles's problem is this is not the first time that he has gone for the old Dad's Army 'We are all doomed' without coming up with any real alternative.</p> <p>\"He sort of lobs a grenade into the party and then backs away and he did have his chance ... in 2007 to come up with alternative policies, and he hasn't come up with them.\"</p> <p>Phil Hope, a Cabinet Office minister, said he did not accept Clarke's claim that many Labour MPs and party members were concerned about Brown's leadership.</p> <p>Commenting on the views of members, he said: \"They want us to get on with the job. They want Gordon Brown to carry on providing competent, strong leadership, taking us through difficult economic times.\"</p> <p>Hope told the BBC's News 24: \"We definitely can win the next election. I have been out on the streets in my constituency and people out there are pleased to see us recognise their concerns. Families and small businesses are seeing us respond directly to the problems we face.</p> <p> \"I say to people like Charles Clarke we are going to win, not by having a row inside the Labour party, but by holding our nerve and making clear the difference between ourselves and the Conservative party.\"</p> <p>Ben Bradshaw, the health minister, told the World at One that Clarke's comments amounted to \"Westminster tittle-tattle\".</p> <p>He said that governments around the world were \"facing a battering at the moment because of the global economic downturn\". </p> <p>John Grogan, Labour MP for Selby, said Clarke needed to decide whether he wanted to act like a practicing politician or a political commentator.</p> <p> \"Give the prime minister time to deal with the economic problems. I think he is finding the language and policies to do that,\" Grogan told the BBC.</p> <p> \"I think we have got 20 months, near enough, before elections have to be called. It is not helpful to have running commentary every time the New Statesman wants to publish a magazine article.\"</p> <p>Helen Jones, Labour MP for Warrington North, also criticised Clarke. Referring to the line in Clarke's article in which he complained about the Just William approach to politics, she said: \"You do not get out of Just William politics if you sound like Violet Elizabeth Bott.</p> <p>Bott was the lisping spoilt girl character in the Just William stories famous for threatening to \"thcream and thcream\" until she was sick.</p> <p>Brown dodged reporters' questions about his leadership when he arrived in Liverpool to address the North West Economics Conference before heading to Scotland to talk to the Scottish CBI tonight.</p> <p>A reporter was repeatedly manhandled away from Brown by undercover police officers.</p>",
  "<p><br>Great to be British? ... spectators at the Olympic handover celebrations in London in August. Photograph: Daniel Deme/EPA</p> <p>I am seriously fed up of hearing about \"the depth of talent and creativity that the UK has to offer\" every time London 2012 is mentioned. The organisers of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/sep/04/cultural.olympiad.coe\">2012 Olympics have today announced details</a> of London's <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/get-involved/cultural-olympiad/index.php\">\"Cultural Olympiad\"</a>, the orbiting artistic events that Olympic cities feel they must offer to maximise tourist profits, sorry, celebrate talent and creativity. And it strikes me as positively offensive that it so blatantly sets out to engulf culture within the nationalism that disfigures modern sport.</p> <p>I was lucky enough to miss most of this summer's Olympics by being on holiday. We caught some of it on Italian TV but it tended to focus on strong Italian sports, like shooting. Yet even in a remote corner of western Sicily it was impossible to avoid a sighting of the Daily Mail's front page: \"GREAT TO BE BRITISH!\" it said. Some swimmers won medals, right? Who cares?</p> <p>Sport is boring so I suppose you need a bit of nationalism to inoculate yourselves to the tedium of watching it. But culture is real. It's about life, death, sex and God/no God. And here is London 2012 roping it into the patriotic bonanza, coarsening, travestying and betraying things that really matter. Things like Shakespeare. The Olympiad's World Shakespeare Festival will celebrate Shakespeare as \"an international property\" - nice of them to acknowledge that - but also, obviously, draw attention to our greatest single object of legitimate cultural pride.</p> <p>The Olympiad will also go heavy on illegitimate cultural pride. There will be \"12 cutting-edge artists' commissions across the UK\". The Olympiad so wants to identify with British art that Sebastian Coe is to run shortly in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/jul/01/art.tatebritain1\">Martin Creed relay at Tate Britain</a>. Yeah, we're the artists of the world. What did America or France ever produce to rival our artists now?</p> <p>Of course, the Cultural Olympiad events claim to be internationalist and global in spirit. But that's the ultimate British complacency. Oh, we're so post-colonial... it's like we want credit as a nation for not being racists. Which we flatter ourselves we're not.</p> <p>I like Britain, actually. Its coastlines, its castles, its language. But all this endless celebration of what's great about the place, and about London especially, is so desperate it's as if no one really believes it. I wonder if such arrogance will withstand the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">economic apocalypse</a> that it seems stands between contemporary London and the year 2012.</p>",
  "<p>Hopes that Britain might experience an Indian summer will be washed away tomorrow amid heavy rains and fears of flooding, forecasters said today.</p> <p>Almost a month's rainfall of 1.9in (50mm) is predicted to fall on Wales and the south-west as autumn storms arrive early, with winds of up to 50mph also expected.</p> <p>The Met Office has issued a severe weather warning for both regions tomorrow and for tomorrow and Saturday for the north-east of England.</p> <p>The Environment Agency issued a flood warning for the river Ely in Cardiff and areas to the north-east of the city.

  "<p>The Bank of England today kept interest rates unchanged in its battle to control inflation, despite growing expectations that the economy is sliding into recession.</p> <p>For the fifth month running, the Bank's monetary policy committee voted to leave rates at 5%, disappointing already struggling homeowners who had hoped for cheaper mortgages. The City had widely expected no change, with the likelihood of a cut put at 45%.</p> <p>The European Central Bank also left interest rates unchanged today, at 4.25%</p> <p>Despite the slowdown, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/13/inflation.creditcrunch1\">inflation has soared </a>because of higher food prices and energy costs. Last month the consumer prices index hit 4.4%, the highest in 16 years and more than twice the Bank's target of 2%. </p> <p>\"Despite the very real danger of recession, it was always likely to prove premature for the Bank to cut interest rates, given well above-target and rising inflation, still significant medium-term inflation risks and the weakness of the pound,\" said Howard Archer at Global Insight. The pound has slid to a 12-year low against a trade-weighted basket of major currencies. He said the minutes of the MPC meeting should make interesting reading when they are released in two weeks' time and will be scoured for signs of whether the committee has shifted further towards cutting interest rates. <br> The Bank is caught in a dilemma as it risks either prolonging the economic downturn or letting inflation spiral out of control. Most economists in the City believe high inflation will force the Bank to keep rates unchanged until the end of the year but many expect at least one rate cut next year when inflation is expected to ease. Oil prices have come off their recent record highs of $148 (\u00a381.2) a barrel and now trade below $110 but gas and electricity prices are still going up.</p> <p>However, as the economic outlook has deteriorated, the chances of a rate cut later this year have increased, with November or December seen as the most likely month.</p> <p>\"The MPC has a delicate balancing act to perform,\" said Andrew Goodwin at the Ernst &amp; Young Item Club. \"With recent data suggesting that the UK economy is heading towards recession, there is a risk that inflation could undershoot the target over the two-year horizon. With oil prices having fallen sharply in recent months and no sign of any second-round effects on wages, we expect the Bank to reduce interest rates once there are clear signs that inflation has peaked. This could be as early as the end of this year.\" </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/sep/04/houseprices.property\">House prices are tumbling</a>, posting the biggest annual fall in August - of 12.7% - since records began in the early 80s, Britain's largest lender Halifax said today. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/03/unemploymentdata.economics1\">Unemployment </a>has risen by 70,000 so far this year and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/03/unemploymentdata.economics\">consumer confidence </a>is at an all-time low.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/02/economicgrowth.creditcrunch\">Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development this week predicted a recession </a>for Britain. In its gloomiest forecast so far, the OECD estimated the UK will shrink 0.3% in the third quarter and 0.4% in the fourth. The prediction came hot on the heels of stark comments by the chancellor, Alistair Darling, who warned the slump would be deeper and longer than expected.</p> <p>The Bank's policy makers are also becoming more concerned about the downturn. Its deputy governor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/26/bankofenglandgovernor.economicgrowth\">Charles Bean</a>, warned last week that the economy was facing a period \"at least as challenging\" as the 70s, when Britain sank into a deep recession. David Blanchflower has voted for a rate cut in recent months as he is worried about the possibility of a prolonged and deep recession.</p> <p>The Bank's dilemma should ease next year. \"While truly dire economic data could prompt another 2008 cut, we remain of the view that it is more likely that the committee will wait until early next year to ease again, especially in view of the recent slide in sterling,\" said Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec.</p> <p>The difficulty of the Bank's task was apparent last month when its rate-setting committee split three ways over the direction of interest rates. Seven MPC members voted to leave borrowing costs on hold, rejecting calls from Tim Besley for a quarter-point increase and from Blanchflower for a cut.</p> <p>James Knightley at ING thinks there was a three-way split again this month, with Besley voting for a hike, Blanchflower for a cut and the rest for no change owing to the dilemma of weaker growth and soaring price pressures. \"Given our view that the UK has entered recession and is unlikely to exit until next summer, we believe that price pressures will moderate and this will open the door for aggressive interest rate cuts,\" he said. He sees rates falling to 3.5% next year. </p> <p>There are some tentative encouraging signs: Britain's service industries shrank for a fourth month running in August but activity picked up and inflationary pressures receded. The improvement suggests the slump in the sector, which ranges from cafes to telecoms and makes up three-quarters of the economy, may have bottomed out.</p>",

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/houseprices\">House prices</a> fell by 1.8% in August, bringing the average price of a property in the UK below the government's new <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/stampduty\">stamp duty</a> threshold, figures showed today.</p> <p>The UK's largest lender, Halifax, said the average price of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/property\">property</a> had fallen by 12.7% since last August - the biggest fall since it began publishing a monthly survey in the early 1980s.</p> <p>Prices have dropped by more than \u00a325,000 since August 2007 when the average cost of a home was \u00a3199,612, and by more than \u00a33,000 since July.</p> <p>The average house price now stands at \u00a3174,178.</p> <p>This is below the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/03/economy.alistairdarling\">new \u00a3175,000 stamp duty threshold</a> introduced by the government on Tuesday as a temporary measure designed to stimulate the housing market.</p> <p>The annual price fall quoted by Halifax is 10.9% - lower than the fall shown by comparing the average prices in August this year and the same month last year.</p> <p>This is because the lender calculates the annual change on the basis of three months' figures, which it says gives a fairer representation of what is happening in the market.</p> <p>This is the first time that figure has been in double-digits since the survey began in 1983.</p> <p>Last week, rival lender Nationwide also reported a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/aug/28/houseprices.property\">first double-digit fall in prices</a>, saying values were down 10.5% year-on-year. </p> <p>The 1.8% fall in August reported by Halifax followed a 1.7% drop in July and was the sixth consecutive monthly fall of more than 1.5%.</p> <p>Martin Ellis, Halifax's chief economist, said market conditions looked set to remain \"challenging\".</p> <p>He said: \"The pressure on householders' income, together with the reduction in the availability of mortgage finance due to the global financial markets crisis, is resulting in both lower property prices and activity levels.\"</p> <p>But he said the market continued to be supported by high employment levels, low interest rates and a shortage of new houses.<br> He added: \"This week's announcement on stamp duty is a welcome development and will benefit a significant number of homebuyers, particularly outside the south-east.\"</p> <h2>Decline as a deterrent</h2> <p>House prices have been falling since last autumn when the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">credit crunch</a> started to reduce the availability of mortgages, making it harder for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/firsttimebuyers\">first-time buyers</a> to raise funds to buy a property.</p> <p>The sharp downturn in prices - and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/aug/07/house.prices.housing.market\">predictions of further falls to come</a> - has also deterred would-be buyers. </p> <p>Figures published by the Bank of England on Monday showed the number of mortgage approvals for house purchases <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/sep/01/mortgages.property\">fell to a record low in July</a>, and surveyors and estate agents have reported low levels of buyer interest over the summer.</p> <p>Although the stamp duty change has been welcomed by lenders and buyers, many experts say the continued lack of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/mortgages\">mortgages</a> will continue to dampen demand.</p> <p>\"Major downward pressure on house prices continues to come from extremely weak market activity, stretched buyer affordability, and tight lending conditions,\" said Howard Archer, chief UK economist at Global Insight. </p> <p>Archer added that rising unemployment could also lead to an increase in the number of homeowners putting their properties on the market for \"distressed\" reasons, which would further depress prices.</p> <p>\"Given these very poor fundamentals for the housing market, it is unlikely that the recently announced government measures to support the housing market will have a significant impact in stabilising activity or prices,\" he said.</p> <h2>Mortgage cuts</h2> <p>Although an interest rate cut might encourage buyers into the market, Archer said the high level of inflation in the UK meant the Bank of England was likely to hold rates when it made its decision today.</p> <p>There has been some good news for borrowers in recent weeks, however, as mortgage rates have started to edge down.</p> <p>According to Moneyfacts, the average cost of a two-year mortgage has returned to its pre-credit crunch level - dropping to 6.39% from a peak of 7.08% in early July.</p> <p>And today, Abbey announced it was cutting rates on its two-, three- and five-year fixed-rate loans by up to 0.3%.</p> <p>First-time buyers have also been given a glimmer of hope, with Skipton building society announcing it would be renewing offering 95% mortgages from September 15.</p> <p>However, the deal is only available to borrowers who save with the society or who have family members who do.</p>",
  "<p>Cost-conscious companies and consumers have boosted sales at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/whitbread\">Whitbread's </a>Premier Inn budget hotels and Beefeater and Brewers Fayre pub restaurants. </p> <p>The leisure group, which also runs Costa coffee shops, has emerged as a beneficiary of the credit crunch as Britons find ways to economise on travel and eating out. The shares jumped 6% to \u00a311.88 in early trading and later traded up 37p at \u00a311.57, a rise of 3.3%. </p> <p>The Premier Inn budget hotel chain, which accounts for the bulk of Whitbread's profits, has outperformed the wider hotel market, with like-for-like sales up 10.2%. The 570-strong hotel chain is on track to open more than 4,000 new rooms this year.</p> <p>Alan Parker, the chief executive, said Premier Inn is increasingly attracting business customers as companies cut their travel budgets amid fears that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/02/economicgrowth.creditcrunch\">economy is sliding into recession</a>. \"Large companies realise they have to save money,\" he said. \"Why pay more than \u00a3100 to stay in a four-star hotel when you can pay \u00a350?\"</p> <p>Business travellers now make up 60% of Premier Inn sales in cash terms, with leisure travellers accounting for the remaining 40%. Business customers tend to stay two nights and spend more while leisure travellers usually stay one night. Leisure bookings slowed in June and July, though August was strong.</p> <p>Paul Hickman at KBC Peel Hunt said Premier Inn is \"currently enjoying an 'Aldi effect' through corporate buyers' cost-cutting, though we feel this may be overtaken by headwinds in 2009 as unemployment rises\".</p> <p>Like-for-like sales across the group climbed by 7% in the 24 weeks to August 14.</p> <p>The pub restaurants increased their sales by 4.4% after the company introduced new menus - including more cheap deals - and revamped its restaurants. Brewers Fayre has a special offer of two meals for \u00a39 during the day, which has been very popular. Covers at the pub restaurants are up 9.3%. KBC's Hickman said this strong growth suggests \"energetic promotion activity, which will have a margin effect\".</p> <p>The group reiterated it remained \"vigilant in these challenging economic times and alert to whatever further action is required\".</p> <p>Faced with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/04/fooddrinks.retail\">soaring food </a>and energy inflation, Whitbread has implemented a \u00a325m cost-saving programme, which involved bringing the hotel and restaurant management teams together. It has also made changes to staff scheduling. </p> <p>Like-for-like sales at the 1,100-outlet Costa chain rose by 3.7%, slower than the 6% growth experienced in the first quarter. Total sales surged 23.6%, driven by Costa's rapid expansion - it now has 331 cafes overseas. It opened in Beijing ahead of the Olympics and now has 30 outlets in China plus a handful in Russia.</p> <p>\"There are no obvious signs to date that the business is being affected by the weakening economic environment,\" said Sam Hart at Charles Stanley stockbrokers.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337286269\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>Mr Chairman, delegates and fellow citizens: I am honoured to be considered for the nomination for vice-president of the United States ...</p> <p>I accept the call to help our nominee for president to serve and defend America. </p> <p>I accept the challenge of a tough fight in this election ... against confident opponents ... at a crucial hour for our country. </p> <p>And I accept the privilege of serving with a man who has come through much harder missions ... and met far graver challenges ... and knows how tough fights are won - the next president of the United States, John S McCain. </p> <p>It was just a year ago when all the experts in Washington counted out our nominee because he refused to hedge his commitment to the security of the country he loves.</p> <p>With their usual certitude, they told us that all was lost - there was no hope for this candidate who said that he would rather lose an election than see his country lose a war. </p> <p>But the pollsters and pundits overlooked just one thing when they wrote him off.</p> <p>They overlooked the caliber of the man himself - the determination, resolve and sheer guts of Senator John McCain. The voters knew better. </p> <p>And maybe that's because they realise there is a time for politics and a time for leadership ... a time to campaign and a time to put our country first. </p> <p>Our nominee for president is a true profile in courage, and people like that are hard to come by.</p> <p>He's a man who wore the uniform of this country for 22 years, and refused to break faith with those troops in Iraq who have now brought victory within sight. </p> <p>And as the mother of one of those troops, that is exactly the kind of man I want as commander in chief. I'm just one of many moms who'll say an extra prayer each night for our sons and daughters going into harm's way. </p> <p>Our son Track is 19. </p> <p>And one week from tomorrow - September 11th - he'll deploy to Iraq with the Army infantry in the service of his country. </p> <p>My nephew Kasey also enlisted, and serves on a carrier in the Persian Gulf.</p> <p>My family is proud of both of them and of all the fine men and women serving the country in uniform. Track is the eldest of our five children. </p> <p>In our family, it's two boys and three girls in between - my strong and kind-hearted daughters Bristol, Willow and Piper. </p> <p>And in April, my husband Todd and I welcomed our littlest one into the world, a perfectly beautiful baby boy named Trig. From the inside, no family ever seems typical.</p> <p>That's how it is with us. </p> <p>Our family has the same ups and downs as any other ... the same challenges and the same joys. </p> <p>Sometimes even the greatest joys bring challenge.</p> <p>And children with special needs inspire a special love. </p> <p>To the families of special-needs children all across this country, I have a message: For years, you sought to make America a more welcoming place for your sons and daughters.</p> <p>I pledge to you that if we are elected, you will have a friend and advocate in the White House. Todd is a story all by himself. </p> <p>He's a lifelong commercial fisherman ... a production operator in the oil fields of Alaska's north slope ... a proud member of the United Steel Workers' Union ... and world champion snow machine racer. </p> <p>Throw in his Yup'ik Eskimo ancestry, and it all makes for quite a package. </p> <p>We met in high school, and two decades and five children later he's still my guy. My mom and dad both worked at the elementary school in our small town. </p> <p>And among the many things I owe them is one simple lesson: that this is America, and every woman can walk through every door of opportunity. </p> <p>My parents are here tonight, and I am so proud to be the daughter of Chuck and Sally Heath. Long ago, a young farmer and haberdasher from Missouri followed an unlikely path to the vice-presidency. </p> <p>A writer observed: \"We grow good people in our small towns, with honesty, sincerity and dignity.\" I know just the kind of people that writer had in mind when he praised Harry Truman.</p> <p>I grew up with those people. </p> <p>They are the ones who do some of the hardest work in America ... who grow our food, run our factories and fight our wars.</p> <p>They love their country, in good times and bad, and they're always proud of America. I had the privilege of living most of my life in a small town. </p> <p>I was just your average hockey mom, and signed up for the PTA because I wanted to make my kids' public education better. </p> <p>When I ran for city council, I didn't need focus groups and voter profiles because I knew those voters, and knew their families, too.</p> <p>Before I became governor of the great state of Alaska, I was mayor of my hometown.</p> <p>And since our opponents in this presidential election seem to look down on that experience, let me explain to them what the job involves. </p> <p>I guess a small-town mayor is sort of like a \"community organizer,\" except that you have actual responsibilities. I might add that in small towns, we don't quite know what to make of a candidate who lavishes praise on working people when they are listening, and then talks about how bitterly they cling to their religion and guns when those people aren't listening.</p> <p>We tend to prefer candidates who don't talk about us one way in Scranton and another way in San Francisco. </p> <p>As for my running mate, you can be certain that wherever he goes, and whoever is listening, John McCain is the same man. I'm not a member of the permanent political establishment.</p> <p>And I've learned quickly, these past few days, that if you're not a member in good standing of the Washington elite, then some in the media consider a candidate unqualified for that reason alone. </p> <p>But here's a little news flash for all those reporters and commentators: I'm not going to Washington to seek their good opinion - I'm going to Washington to serve the people of this country. Americans expect us to go to Washington for the right reasons, and not just to mingle with the right people.</p> <p>Politics isn't just a game of clashing parties and competing interests. </p> <p>The right reason is to challenge the status quo, to serve the common good, and to leave this nation better than we found it.</p> <p>No one expects us to agree on everything.</p> <p>But we are expected to govern with integrity, good will, clear convictions and ... a servant's heart. </p> <p>I pledge to all Americans that I will carry myself in this spirit as vice president of the United States. This was the spirit that brought me to the governor's office, when I took on the old politics as usual in Juneau ... when I stood up to the special interests, the lobbyists, big oil companies, and the good-ol' boys network.</p> <p>Sudden and relentless reform never sits well with entrenched interests and power brokers. That's why true reform is so hard to achieve. </p> <p>But with the support of the citizens of Alaska, we shook things up.</p> <p>And in short order we put the government of our state back on the side of the people.</p> <p>I came to office promising major ethics reform, to end the culture of self-dealing. And today, that ethics reform is the law. </p> <p>While I was at it, I got rid of a few things in the governor's office that I didn't believe our citizens should have to pay for.</p> <p>That luxury jet was over the top. I put it on eBay. </p> <p>I also drive myself to work.</p> <p>And I thought we could muddle through without the governor's personal chef - although I've got to admit that sometimes my kids sure miss her. I came to office promising to control spending - by request if possible and by veto if necessary. </p> <p>Senator McCain also promises to use the power of veto in defense of the public interest - and as a chief executive, I can assure you it works.</p> <p>Our state budget is under control.</p> <p>We have a surplus.</p> <p>And I have protected the taxpayers by vetoing wasteful spending: nearly half a billion dollars in vetoes. </p> <p>I suspended the state fuel tax, and championed reform to end the abuses of earmark spending by Congress.</p> <p>I told the Congress \"thanks, but no thanks,\" for that bridge to nowhere.</p> <p>If our state wanted a bridge, we'd build it ourselves. When oil and gas prices went up dramatically, and filled up the state treasury, I sent a large share of that revenue back where it belonged - directly to the people of Alaska. </p> <p>And despite fierce opposition from oil company lobbyists, who kind of liked things the way they were, we broke their monopoly on power and resources.</p> <p>As governor, I insisted on competition and basic fairness to end their control of our state and return it to the people.</p> <p>I fought to bring about the largest private-sector infrastructure project in North American history. </p> <p>And when that deal was struck, we began a nearly $40bn natural gas pipeline to help lead America to energy independence.</p> <p>That pipeline, when the last section is laid and its valves are opened, will lead America one step farther away from dependence on dangerous foreign powers that do not have our interests at heart. </p> <p>The stakes for our nation could not be higher.</p> <p>When a hurricane strikes in the Gulf of Mexico, this country should not be so dependent on imported oil that we are forced to draw from our strategic petroleum reserve.</p> <p>And families cannot throw away more and more of their paychecks on gas and heating oil. </p> <p>With Russia wanting to control a vital pipeline in the Caucasus, and to divide and intimidate our European allies by using energy as a weapon, we cannot leave ourselves at the mercy of foreign suppliers.</p> <p>To confront the threat that Iran might seek to cut off nearly a fifth of world energy supplies ... or that terrorists might strike again at the Abqaiq facility in Saudi Arabia ... or that Venezuela might shut off its oil deliveries ... we Americans need to produce more of our own oil and gas. </p> <p>And take it from a gal who knows the north slope of Alaska: we've got lots of both.</p> <p>Our opponents say, again and again, that drilling will not solve all of America's energy problems - as if we all didn't know that already.</p> <p>But the fact that drilling won't solve every problem is no excuse to do nothing at all. </p> <p>Starting in January, in a McCain-Palin administration, we're going to lay more pipelines build more nuclear plants create jobs with clean coal ... and move forward on solar, wind, geothermal and other alternative sources.</p> <p>We need American energy resources, brought to you by American ingenuity and produced by American workers. I've noticed a pattern with our opponent.</p> <p>Maybe you have, too.</p> <p>We've all heard his dramatic speeches before devoted followers. </p> <p>And there is much to like and admire about our opponent.</p> <p>But listening to him speak, it's easy to forget that this is a man who has authored two memoirs but not a single major law or reform - not even in the state senate. </p> <p>This is a man who can give an entire speech about the wars America is fighting, and never use the word \"victory\" except when he's talking about his own campaign. But when the cloud of rhetoric has passed ... when the roar of the crowd fades away ... when the stadium lights go out, and those Styrofoam Greek columns are hauled back to some studio lot - what exactly is our opponent's plan? What does he actually seek to accomplish, after he's done turning back the waters and healing the planet? The answer is to make government bigger ... take more of your money ... give you more orders from Washington ... and to reduce the strength of America in a dangerous world. America needs more energy ... our opponent is against producing it. </p> <p>Victory in Iraq is finally in sight ... he wants to forfeit.</p> <p>Terrorist states are seeking nuclear weapons without delay ... he wants to meet them without preconditions.</p> <p>Al Qaeda terrorists still plot to inflict catastrophic harm on America ... he's worried that someone won't read them their rights? Government is too big ... he wants to grow it.</p> <p>Congress spends too much ... he promises more. </p> <p>Taxes are too high ... he wants to raise them. His tax increases are the fine print in his economic plan, and let me be specific.</p> <p>The Democratic nominee for president supports plans to raise income taxes ... raise payroll taxes ... raise investment income taxes ... raise the death tax ... raise business taxes ... and increase the tax burden on the American people by hundreds of billions of dollars. My sister Heather and her husband have just built a service station that's now opened for business - like millions of others who run small businesses. </p> <p>How are they going to be any better off if taxes go up? Or maybe you're trying to keep your job at a plant in Michigan or Ohio ... or create jobs with clean coal from Pennsylvania or West Virginia ... or keep a small farm in the family right here in Minnesota.</p> <p>How are you going to be better off if our opponent adds a massive tax burden to the American economy? Here's how I look at the choice Americans face in this election.</p> <p>In politics, there are some candidates who use change to promote their careers. </p> <p>And then there are those, like John McCain, who use their careers to promote change.</p> <p>They're the ones whose names appear on laws and landmark reforms, not just on buttons and banners, or on self-designed presidential seals. </p> <p>Among politicians, there is the idealism of high-flown speechmaking, in which crowds are stirringly summoned to support great things. </p> <p>And then there is the idealism of those leaders, like John McCain, who actually do great things. They're the ones who are good for more than talk ... the ones we have always been able to count on to serve and defend America. Senator McCain's record of actual achievement and reform helps explain why so many special interests, lobbyists and comfortable committee chairmen in Congress have fought the prospect of a McCain presidency - from the primary election of 2000 to this very day. </p> <p>Our nominee doesn't run with the Washington herd.</p> <p>He's a man who's there to serve his country, and not just his party. </p> <p>A leader who's not looking for a fight, but is not afraid of one either. Harry Reid, the majority leader of the current do-nothing Senate, not long ago summed up his feelings about our nominee. </p> <p>He said, quote, \"I can't stand John McCain\". Ladies and gentlemen, perhaps no accolade we hear this week is better proof that we've chosen the right man. Clearly what the majority leader was driving at is that he can't stand up to John McCain. That is only one more reason to take the maverick of the Senate and put him in the White House. My fellow citizens, the American presidency is not supposed to be a journey of \"personal discovery.\" This world of threats and dangers is not just a community, and it doesn't just need an organizer. </p> <p>And though both Senator Obama and Senator Biden have been going on lately about how they are always, quote, \"fighting for you,\" let us face the matter squarely. </p> <p>There is only one man in this election who has ever really fought for you ... in places where winning means survival and defeat means death ... and that man is John McCain. In our day, politicians have readily shared much lesser tales of adversity than the nightmare world in which this man, and others equally brave, served and suffered for their country. </p> <p>It's a long way from the fear and pain and squalor of a six-by-four cell in Hanoi to the Oval Office.</p> <p>But if Senator McCain is elected president, that is the journey he will have made. </p> <p>It's the journey of an upright and honourable man - the kind of fellow whose name you will find on war memorials in small towns across this country, only he was among those who came home. </p> <p>To the most powerful office on earth, he would bring the compassion that comes from having once been powerless ... the wisdom that comes even to the captives, by the grace of God ... the special confidence of those who have seen evil, and seen how evil is overcome. A fellow prisoner of war, a man named Tom Moe of Lancaster, Ohio, recalls looking through a pin-hole in his cell door as lieutenant commander John McCain was led down the hallway, by the guards, day after day.</p> <p>As the story is told, \"When McCain shuffled back from torturous interrogations, he would turn toward Moe's door and flash a grin and thumbs up\" - as if to say, \"We're going to pull through this\". My fellow Americans, that is the kind of man America needs to see us through these next four years. </p> <p>For a season, a gifted speaker can inspire with his words.</p> <p>For a lifetime, John McCain has inspired with his deeds.</p> <p>If character is the measure in this election ... and hope the theme ... and change the goal we share, then I ask you to join our cause. Join our cause and help America elect a great man as the next president of the United States.</p> <p>Thank you all, and may God bless America.</p>"
