  "<p>Where does a junkie's time go? Mostly in 15-minute increments, like a bug-eyed Tarzan, swinging from hit to hit. For months on end in 1988, I sat inside a house in north Minneapolis, doing coke and listening to Tracy Chapman's 'Fast Car' and finding my own pathetic resonance in the lyrics. 'Any place is better,' she sang. 'Starting from zero, got nothing to lose.' <br>After shooting or smoking a large dose, there would be the tweaking and a vigil at the front window, pulling up the corner of the blinds to look for the squads I was always convinced were on their way. All day. All night. A frantic kind of boring. End-stage addiction is mostly about waiting for the police, or someone, to come and bury you in your shame.</p> <p>After a while I noticed the blinds on the upper duplex diagonal from the house were doing the same thing. The light would leak through a corner and disappear. I began to think of the rise and fall of their blinds and mine as a kind of Morse code, sent back and forth across the street in winking increments that said the same thing over and over.</p> <p>W-e a-r-e g-e-t-t-i-n-g h-i-g-h t-o-o.</p> <p>They rarely came out, and neither did I, so we never discussed our shared hobby. </p> <p>I was lonely, but not alone. The house belonged to Anna, my girlfriend and dope dealer, who had two kids of her own and newborn twins by me. One night, Anna was out somewhere, and I was there with the kids. I had a new pipe, clean screens, a fresh blowtorch and the kids were asleep. It was just me and Barley, a Corgi mix I'd had since college. When I was alone and tweaking with Barley, I'd ask her random questions. Barley didn't talk back per se, but I heard answers staring into her large brown eyes.</p> <p>Am I a lunatic? Yes. When am I going to cut this stuff out? Apparently never. Does God see me right now? Yes. God sees everything, including the blind. </p> <p>Trapped in drug-induced paranoia, I began to think of the police as God's emissaries, arriving not to seek vengeance but a ceasefire, a truce that would put me up against a wall of well-deserved consequences, and the non-combatants, the children, out of harm's way.</p> <p>On this night \u2013 it was near the end \u2013 every hit sent out an alarm along my vibrating synapses. If the cops were coming, I should be sitting out in front of the house. That way I could tell them that yes, there were drugs and paraphernalia in the house, but no guns. And there were four blameless children. They could put the bracelets on me and, head bowed, I'd solemnly lead them to the drugs, to the needles, to the pipes, to what was left of the money. And then some sweet-faced matrons would magically appear and scoop up those babies and take them to that safe, happy place. I had it all planned out.</p> <p>I took another hit, and Barley and I walked out and sat on the steps. My eyes, my heart, the veins in my forehead, pulsed against the stillness of the night. And then they came. Six unmarked cars riding in formation with lights off, no cherries, just like I pictured. It's on.</p> <p>A mix of uniforms and plainclothes got out, and in the weak light of the street, I could see long guns held at 45-degree angles. I was oddly proud that I was on the steps, that I now stood between my children and the dark fruits of the life I had chosen. I had made the right move after endless wrong ones. And then they turned and went to the house across the street.</p> <p>Much yelling. 'Facedown! Hug the carpet! No sudden movements!' A guy dropped out of the second-floor window wearing only gym shorts, but they were waiting. More yelling and then quiet. I went back inside the house and watched the rest of it play out through the corner of the blind. Their work done, the cops loaded several cuffed people into a van. I let go of the blind and got back down to business. It wasn't my turn.</p> <p>Twenty years later, now sober and back for a look at my past, I sat outside that house on Oliver Avenue on a hot summer day in a rental car, staring long and hard to make sense of what had and had not happened there. The neighbourhood had turned over from white to black, but it was pretty much the same. Nice lawns, lots of kids, no evidence of the mayhem that had gone on inside. Sitting there in a suit with a nice job in a city far away and those twins on their way to college, I almost would have thought I'd made it up. But I don't think I did. While I sat there giving my past the once over, someone lifted up the corner of the blind in the living-room window. It was time to go.</p> <p>On the face of it, I am no more qualified to take my own inventory than the addict with the fetid dreads who spare-changes people on the subway while singing 'Stand by Me'. Ask him how he ended up sweating people for quarters, and he may have an answer, but he doesn't really know and probably couldn't bear it if he did.</p> <p>To be an addict is to be something of a cognitive acrobat. You spread versions of yourself around, giving each person the truth he or she needs \u2013 you need, actually \u2013 to keep them at a remove. Let's stipulate that I do not have a good memory, having recklessly saut\u00e9ed my brain in fistfuls of pharmaceutical spices. Beyond impairment, there may be no more unreliable narrator than an addict. Recovered or not, I am someone who used my mouth to constantly create one more opportunity to get high. </p> <p>Here is what I deserved: hepatitis C, federal prison time, HIV, a cold park bench, an early, addled death.</p> <p>Here is what I got: the smart, pretty wife, the three lovely children, the job that impresses.</p> <p>Here is what I remember about how That Guy became This Guy: not much. But my version of events is worth knowing, if for no other reason than I was there. </p> <p>I was born a middle kid in a family of seven children into a John Cheever novel set on the border of Hopkins and Minnetonka, suburbs on the western edge of Minneapolis. It was a suburban idyll where any mayhem was hidden in the rear rooms of large split-level houses. My home was a good one; my parents were kind; no one slipped me a Mickey, and if they had, I would have grabbed it with both hands and asked for another. It is baked into my nature. </p> <p>Let's skip high school. I graduated and travelled out west, hopping on a bus with the so-called Rainbow Family, and on the ensuing ride, they gifted me peyote, a profound sense of life's psychedelic possibilities and a tenacious case of the crabs. I came back to Minneapolis and took crummy jobs, including working at a hydraulic-tube assembly plant, where my boss took Dolly Parton's breasts as his central religious icons. I eventually enrolled in two land-grant universities where I had many friends, very little money and what Pavlov called 'the blind force of the subcortex'. I subsisted on Pop-Tarts and Mountain Dew, along with LSD, peyote, pot, mushrooms, mescaline, amphetamines, Quaaludes, valium, opium, hash and alcohol of all kinds. Total garbage head.</p> <p>On my 21st birthday, a dealer who dropped his money on Dom P\u00e9rignon at the fancy restaurant where I worked palmed me a cigarette tin and told me to open it in the bathroom. I did the powder inside and it was a Helen Keller hand-under-the-water moment. Lordy, I can finally see! My endorphins made a Proustian leap at this new opportunity, hugging it and feeling all its splendid corners.</p> <p>Every addict is formed in the crucible of the memory of that first hit. Even as the available endorphins attenuate, the memory is right there. By 1985, I tried freebasing coke and its more prosaic sibling, crack.</p> <p>'Crackhead' is an embarrassing line to have on a CV. If meth tweakers had not come along and made a grab for the crown \u2013 meth makes you crazy and toothless \u2013 crackheads would be at the bottom of the junkie org chart. In the beginning, smokable cocaine fills you with childlike wonder, a feeling that the carnival had come to town and chosen your cranium as the venue for its next show. Most people who sample it get a sense of its lurid ambush and walk away.</p> <p>Many years later, my pal Donald sat in a cabin in Newport, Minnesota, staring into a video camera I had brought and recalling the crackhead version of me: 'As good friends as we were, as much as I loved you, you weren't you. I wasn't talking to my friend; I was talking to a wild man. You were a creature. I was afraid.'</p> <p>If the subject of careers or majors came up, I told people I was a journalist, with only that uttered noun as evidence. But then I caught a real, actual story for the local weekly and the fever to go with it. I was a dog on a meat bone when it came to stories; I could type \u2013 and sometimes write \u2013 as fast as the next guy, and I had an insatiable need to know more. My work got noticed, and some of the more unfortunate aspects of the guy who produced it were overlooked. I got jobs, nailed investigative targets and won a few awards.</p> <p>During the day, I took the slipperiness of public officials personally \u2013 my moral dudgeon is freighted with irony in retrospect \u2013 and displayed significant promise as a reporter. But as time wore on, I combined a life of early promise as a writer with dark nights full of half-baked gangsters and full-blown addiction. I became a dealer for the creative community in Minneapolis, selling coke to colleagues, comedians and club kids. I was a frantic fan of the amazing Minneapolis music scene at the time \u2013 Soul Asylum, the Replacements, Prince \u2013 but the only thing I played with any regularity was drug-addled fool. I moved grams, eight balls, ounces, quarter pounds \u2013 no one trusted me with a kilo for more than a few minutes. Every day I would wake up to a catalogue of my misbegotten life \u2013 jobs, money, girlfriends and family were all subject to the ineluctable entropy of the junkie lifestyle. </p> <p>There were signs early on that the centre would not hold. In the mid-Eighties, I was working on a running story about a suspect who had been accidentally shot dead while he was being taken into custody by the police department's decoy unit. In the middle of the reporting, my phone rang, and one of the cops from the decoy unit was on the line. 'You know, I've been asking around, and your life is not without blemish,' I remember him saying. 'You better watch your step.' For weeks afterward, I would drive somewhere and see the van from the decoy unit in my rear-view. </p> <p>Some of my running buddies went to prison, but I was more of a misdemeanant, spending hours \u2013 and every once in a while, days \u2013 in various county jails. </p> <p>My duplicity around women was towering and chronic. I conned and manipulated myself into their beds and then treated them like human jewellery, something to be worn for effect. And when I was called to account, <br>I sometimes responded with violence.</p> <p>One night in 1986, I was at a party for Phil, my longtime coke connection who was going away to prison. I met Anna, who had better coke than Phil and soon developed a fondness for me. She was selling serious amounts of coke and allowed me to pretend I was her partner. We were an appalling mix, metastasized by her unlimited supply. In less than a year, I lost my job, and she lost her business.</p> <p>It would have ended there, but on 15 April 1988 Anna had twin girls. My daughters. Our remaining friends had begged us, quite reasonably, to abort them. Pals began to boycott our house because it had become such a grim, near-scientific tableau of addiction's progression.</p> <p>Eventually we both went to treatment, and our kids went into foster care. I sobered up; Anna did, too, until she didn't; and I obtained physical custody of the twins, Erin and Meagan. As a power trio, we worked our way off welfare. I married somebody grand, we had a baby, and professionally one thing led to another, and I ended up working at the New York Times. I have lived most of the last two decades showered by those promises that recovery delivers, with luck, industry and fate guiding me to a life beyond all expectation.</p> <p>But was it really all thus? When memory is called to answer, it often answers back with deception. How is it that almost every warm bar stool contains a hero, a star of his own epic, who is the sum of his amazing stories? </p> <p>If I said I was a fat thug who beat up women and sold bad coke, would you like my story? What if instead I wrote that I was a recovered addict who obtained sole custody of my twin girls, got us off welfare and raised them by myself, even though I had a little touch of cancer? Now we're talking. They are equally true, but as a member of a self-interpreting species, one that fights to keep disharmony at a remove, I'm inclined to mention my tenderhearted attentions as a single parent before I get around to the fact I hit their mother when we were together. We tell ourselves that we lie to protect others, but the self usually comes out looking damn good in the process. </p> <p>The arc of the addict, warm and familiar as a Hallmark movie with only the details pivoting, is especially tidy in the recollection:</p> <p>I had a beer with friends.<br>I shot dope into my neck.<br>I got in trouble.<br>I saw the error of my ways.<br>I found Jesus or 12 steps or bhakti yoga.<br>Now everything is new again.</p> <p>In the convention of the recovery narrative, readers will want to scan past the tick-tock, looking for the yucky part so that they can feel better about themselves. (Here's a taste: when I got to detox for what I thought was the last time, they took one look at my arms and brought me a tub filled with lukewarm water and Dreft detergent to soak my scabrous, pus-filled track marks. They dropped pills into my mouth from several inches away as if feeding a baby bird, and even the wet-brain drunks wouldn't come near me. See how that works?)</p> <p>Today I am a genuine, often pleasant person, I do solid work for a reputable organisation and have, over the breadth of time, proved to be an attentive father and husband. But drugs, it seems to me, do not conjure demons; they reveal them. So how to reconcile my past with my current circumstances? Which, you might ask, of my two selves did I make up?</p> <p>As a veteran journalist, I decided to report the story. For two years on and off, I pulled medical and legal documents and engaged in a series of interviews with people I used to run with. By turns, it became a kind of journalistic ghost dancing, trying to conjure spirits past, including mine. </p> <p>Some people I interviewed wanted me to say I was sorry \u2013 I am, and I did. Some people wanted me to say I remembered \u2013 I did, and I did not. And some people wanted me to say it was all a mistake \u2013 it was, and it was not. It felt less like journalism than archaeology, a job that required shovels and axes, hacking my way into dark, little-used passages. It would prove to be an enlightening and sickening enterprise, a new frontier in the annals of self-involvement. I would show up at the doorsteps of people I had not seen in two decades and ask them to explain myself to me.</p> <p>In drug-gangster movies, the kingpin is always some guy with a pock-marked face who has goombahs at his flanks on the way into the restaurant, sits with his back against the wall and always gets the big piece of chicken. But the most successful person I did business with was just a touch over 5ft, cute, with a full head of dyed blonde hair, a little mouth and a fondness for maniacs in matters of the heart, if not business.</p> <p>When I met Anna, I was more or less living with Doolie, a woman I adored. I began stepping out on her because Anna was in high effect, moving what she said was a kilo a month from straight-up Colombian sources through a series of reliable associates who were also her pals. She worked dead letter boxes in storage spots, safe-deposit boxes and mules to keep her at a distance from the nuts and bolts of the drug enterprise. When the piles of money were too big to hand count, she used a digital scale to weigh piles of twenties. She had two kids in a nice house in north Minneapolis; the serious dope business was done elsewhere. </p> <p>On our first date, we mowed through my eight ball \u2013 an eighth of an ounce \u2013 of indifferent coke. She sent me to a safe under the carpet of her steps, and I beheld a pressed kilo of pure cocaine. Decades later, we were talking outside a hotel in Tucson. She still had no trouble recalling the dimensions of a kilo of coke.</p> <p>'It was about as big as a book, about this big,' she said, framing the air with her hands. 'It still had the snake seals; I mean, it was right from the Medell\u00edn cartel.'</p> <p>It had been 10 years since we had even seen each other. Of all the trips I had taken in pursuit of the past, this was one in which a common truth was unlikely to emerge. We each need to find a place to put our time together that does not leave either of us immobilised with shame. I ended up with our kids, but the moral ground curiously rests with her. I hit her, for one thing. And whatever she did, she did out of a kind of love. My instincts were far more mercenary.</p> <p>In her version, everything was going swimmingly until I came along, and then I seduced her into smoking cocaine. In my version, I lumbered into her life, succumbed to abundant blandishments and descended into a violent, destructive mania. </p> <p>For a time, we were both riding high. I had a budding reputation as a reporter, and she was one of the most respectable sources of serious weight in the city. Anna introduced me to her pals as her trusted associate, but they all knew precisely what I represented: the guy who would ruin a good thing. Certainly she got a primer from me, observing that the difference between snorting and smoking coke was vast.</p> <p>'We fought for about six months about it, and then I joined you,' she remembered. She tipped over almost immediately. By the spring of 1988, six months after we had got together, her business was in disarray, I had lost my job and then, oh, yeah, she was pregnant. Together, Anna and I drew many lines in the sand and then stepped across them, usually with me leading the way.</p> <p>When Anna's waters broke in her living room on Oliver Avenue, I had just handed her a crack pipe. (Anna, by the way, swears such a thing never took place. I have my memories, and she has hers.) She had just entered her third trimester. Were we in the midst of giving birth or participating in a kind of neonatal homicide? The water beneath her became a puddle of implication. Now look what we did.</p> <p>'Man, them are little babies, where'd you get 'em?' The kid, about eight, saw me coming out of the hospital with a twin in each arm in May 1988. I was speechless. How could a child this small, this unknowing, tell at a glance that these children had landed on me from a very great distance?</p> <p>They had been patients in the neonatal intensive care unit for a month. Born at 2.5lb and 2.9lb, and each just over 15in, Meagan and Erin arrived two and a half months premature. According to medical records, which I requested almost 20 years after the fact, Erin 'cried spontaneously, but each time her crying stopped, her heart rate decreased and her respiratory effort became poor. She was intubated in the delivery room ...' Meagan 'had umbilical, artery and venous catheters placed on 16/4/88 for blood pressure and arterial blood-gas monitoring and for delivery of emergency medications.' Once the jaundice of their early birth wore off, they were small pink spots surrounded by an array of tubes and machines, the organic part of the apparatus.</p> <p>As I stared at them in my addled state on visits to the hospital, my mind wandered to bath time, something I had heard that you did with babies. What would we use, a teacup? </p> <p>Once we got the girls home, the heart and respiration monitors seemed designed specifically to terrorise us. One of them would shift positions or spit up a bit, and the alarms would go off. Recently, I went to see a pal, Chris, now a professor of creative writing in New Orleans, who watched the unfurling disaster back then.</p> <p>'One winter night, you called me late and said: \"We're out of diapers, we don't have diapers,\" and you thought somebody was watching the house,' he recalled. 'You guys were paranoid and getting high, and you said, \"I think the cops are watching the house; I can't leave,\" and so I went to the convenience store, got some diapers, drove over, with diapers and milk or something.'</p> <p>Chris did what he could, but other friends thought of calling the authorities. A document I found in the twins' medical files suggested they were already on the case: 'The parents have appeared to be open about their drug use. They have stated their intention to attend AA meetings and provide a chemically free environment for their children. This may be difficult without intervention, considering the long reported history of drug use,' said a letter dated 22 April 1988, from the medical team to Child Protective Services of Hennepin County.</p> <p>I remember driving to a dark spot between the streetlights at the rounded-off corner of West 32nd and Garfield. Right here, I thought. This would be fine.<br>The Nova, a wreck with a bad paint job my brother bought me out of pity, shuddered to a stop, and I saw two sleeping children in the rear-view, the fringe of their hoods emerging in outline against the back seat as my eyes adjusted to the light. Teeny, tiny, itty-bitty, the girls were swallowed by the snowsuits. We should not have been there. But I was fresh out. I had nothing. I called Kenny.</p> <p>Anna was out, and I could not bear to leave them at home, but I was equally unable to stay put. So here we were, one big, happy family, parked outside the dope house. Then came the junkie maths. If I went inside the house, I could get what I needed in five minutes, 10 minutes tops. The twins would sleep, dreaming their little baby dreams where their dad is a nice man, where the car rides end at a playground.</p> <p>The people inside would be busy, working mostly in pairs. Serious coke shooting is something best done together. The objective is to walk right up to the edge of an overdose without actually dying. The technique was to push the plunger in slow but large. One would be pushing, watching as the other listened to the interior sound of blood and nerves brought to a boil. Are you good? Yes. No ... Just, um ... ah ... that's perfect.</p> <p>Kenny's lip-licking coke rap was more ornate, somehow more satisfying, than that of most of the dealers I worked with. His worldview was all black helicopters and white noise \u2013 the whispering, unseen others who would one day come for us. It kept me on my toes.</p> <p>But tonight I had company. I certainly couldn't bring the twins in. Even in the gang I ran with, coming through the doors of the dope house swinging two occupied baby buckets was not done. Sitting there in the gloom of the front seat, the car making settling noises against the chill, I decided that my teeny twin girls would be safe, that God would look after them while I did not.<br>I got out, locked the door and walked away. Inside, a transformation \u2013 almost a kidnapping \u2013 got under way. The guilty father was replaced by a junkie, no different from the others sitting there. Time passed, one thing begot another and eventually I was thrown clear.</p> <p>Leaving, I remember that. Out the metal door and then out the front door with its three bolts onto the porch and the hollow sound of my boots on the wood floor. A pause. How long had it been, really? Hours, not minutes. I walked toward the darkened car with drugs in my pocket and a cold dread in all corners of my being.</p> <p>I cracked the front door, reached around, unlocked the back and leaned in.<br>I could see their breath.</p> <p>God had looked after the twins, and by proxy me, but I realised at that moment that I was in the midst of a transgression He could not easily forgive. I made a decision never to be that man again.</p> <p>In Minneapolis 19 years later, I stood on the spot outside Kenny's where I parked that night. The car was, according to my brother Jim, a Chevy Nova. He sent me the title: '79 Chevy Nova with 89,950 miles on it, plate number NHS091. Thinking back through all those years, I remember standing by the car, I remember looking back in. I remember the maths. And I remember the snowsuits.</p> <p>But that's where the plot thickens and the facts collide. Erin and Meagan were born on 15 April 1988. Whenever I felt compelled to explain myself and the cold facts of our history, that night outside Kenny's was the necessary moment. In the story as I recited it, that horrible night occurred very soon after they were born. I thought I quickly entered treatment because even though I had been an unreliable employee, a conniving friend and a duplicitous husband, nothing in my upbringing allowed me to proceed as a bad father. The twins were then whisked into temporary foster care soon after their birth. After that, it's a Joseph Campbell myth in which our hero embraces his road of trials, begins to attain a new self and hotfoots it back to the normal world.</p> <p>Nice story if you can live it. If the girls were born in April, and I went into treatment a few months afterwards, as I have always said, where did the snowsuits come from? Minnesota is cold, but not that cold.</p> <p>When I was talking to my brother about the make of the car and mentioned the snowsuits, he said: 'That's easy. You didn't go to treatment until sometime in December, like, eight months after they were born.'</p> <p>He's almost right. I did not enter Eden House, a six-month inpatient treatment programme in Minneapolis, until 25 November 1988. So the presence of snowsuits on a cold November night were undoubtedly real. That part about me straightening out right after they were born? A myth, but not the kind Joseph Campbell had in mind.</p> <p>Sometime soon after that night at Kenny's \u2013 the week before Thanksgiving 1988, as I would later find out \u2013 I became convinced that something brutal and unspeakable was about to land on all of us, including the kids. At our house, it was all needles, blood, babies and piles of dirty clothes. High or not, it was hellish to behold. </p> <p>I called my parents and said that if they took the kids, I would go to detox and Anna would go to treatment. 'You told us that there were no adults in the house, that it was a dangerous place for children to be,' my dad recalled, as I talked to him on his deck overlooking Lake Minnetonka in the summer of 2006.</p> <p>Detoxes are really human aquariums, a place where large, Librium-infused humans bob here and there, watched by the staff through thick plate glass in case one of them freaks out or starts flopping around. My job, as it turned out, was to settle my arms up to my biceps in a large tub of Dreft detergent, a nice low-tech way of disinfecting my track marks without involving a lot of hands-on work by the staff. </p> <p>I had become a white-trash untouchable.</p> <p>A few days later, my parents had Thanks-giving dinner, and I came straight from detox. My babies were there. After dinner, my parents spoke to me quietly, off to the side. They had spoken to my older brother, John, who worked in leadership for the Catholic Church, and he had wired up temporary foster care through Catholic Charities. Erin and Meagan would be placed with a family while I went 'to deal with things'. It was decided that I would follow my detox with an intensive six-month rehab programme at Eden House, a last-chance facility in downtown Minneapolis. Eden House was a long-term therapeutic community, the kind of place that brimmed with slogans. This was the main one: 'The answer to life is learning to live.' </p> <p>This is the point where the knowing author laughs along with his readers about his time among the aphorisms, how he was once so gullible and needy that he drank deeply of such weak and fruity Kool-Aid. That's some other story. Slogans saved my life. All of them \u2013 the dumb ones, the imperatives, the shameless, witless ones.</p> <p>I lustily chanted some of those slogans and lived by others. There is nothing romantic about being a crackhead and a drunk \u2013 low-bottom addiction is its own burlesque that needs no scornful annotation. Unless a person is willing to be terminally, frantically earnest, all hope is lost.</p> <p>All the assets I had \u2013 an ability to verbalise, intellectualise and filibuster \u2013 got no play at Eden House. In at least a few other treatment centres, I was often seen as baby Jesus, a counsellor's pet who knew all the jargon and right buttons to push. At Eden House, I was seen as a fool, and a pretty soft one at that. It wasn't Abu Ghraib, but it wasn't the treatment place with the elliptical machine and a staff nutritionist, either.</p> <p>The chronicity of addiction is really a kind of fatalism writ large. If an addict knows in his heart he is going to use someday, why not today? But if a thin reed of hope appears \u2013 the possibility that it will not always be so \u2013 things change. You live another day and then get up and do it again. Hope is oxygen to someone who is suffocating on despair.</p> <p>The implications of a misstep arrived every weekend. My parents would come by with the twins after having picked them up from the foster-care family and set them down to crawl around in the visiting room. I can remember one of the female counsellors \u2013 Beth, maybe \u2013 coming in and marvelling at Erin and Meagan and asking no one in particular whom they belonged to. It took me just a second to realise the answer.</p> <p>'That would be me.'</p> <p>When I got out of Eden House after six months, I moved into a sober house and began taking care of the kids here and there. Anna and I were no longer together, but she had sobered up as well, so the children had been returned to her. But while I was going to recovery meetings and doing my little freelance writing assignments, Anna began struggling. </p> <p>One day in the summer of 1989, I showed up at her house and the twins were wet, hungry and wailing. We went to the nearby 7-Eleven on Penn and Dowling Avenues in north Minneapolis. I waited until the spot right in front of the door opened up, and I went and quickly bought diapers, milk, new bottles and some bananas. While I changed them, they ate the bananas and drank the milk with an animal intensity. I decided not to take them back, not knowing what it meant other than the fact that I would need my own place, more clothes and more money.</p> <p>If I am a good person now and an able father, I must have been the easy choice as custodial parent back in the day. In this formulation, when I started pursuing custody, I was just a beefier version of Mother Teresa, all selflessness and calm, and Anna was a nasty basket case. </p> <p>Eighteen years after the case was decided, I went to see Barbara, the attorney who helped me obtain custody of my daughters. These many years later, Barbara hesitated when I ran that story, and then told a different one. </p> <p>'You looked unwell,' she said. 'You weighed close to 300lb. It was in the winter, and you had on a very heavy coat, but it obviously didn't fit you; it was raggedy. If I had seen you on the street, I would have thought you were homeless, because you were very rough. Your hygiene was bad; your eyes were rheumy.'</p> <p>But I was a man about my business, right?</p> <p>'I wasn't used to having clients look like you. I didn't do criminal; I represented banks and mortgage companies, and so to have you come in and want custody of two little babies, um, I struggled with whether or not that was even a realistic goal that we should consider ... I couldn't tell if you were following along well enough to understand the impact of what this would mean to your life.'</p> <p>So other than being addled from an unspeakable habit, a little smelly and a touch on the amazingly obese scale, I was good to go. Ready to star in one of those car adverts where the kids crack wise in the back seat while the dad says something sage and knowing into the rear-view. Except I didn't have a car. And the kids did not legally belong to me. I had never married their mother or established my paternity. I had no insurance, and I had not paid taxes in several years.</p> <p>Although Anna has always given me abundant credit for doing a good job with our twins, she is quick to remind me that I stole them in the first place. A part of me was convinced she was right. Revisiting the issue with Barbara, I talked about how we managed to persuade Anna to take a drug test when she moved back from Texas, where she had been staying with her mum. We made visits conditional on a clean result, and she came up positive for cocaine and pot. I remembered this as a clever linchpin in our legal strategy, but Barbara reminded me that Anna had failed that test over and over and that she moved in with a dope dealer when she got to town. How she missed appointments to see the kids, missed court dates, switched lawyers and eventually agreed to a settlement that gave me physical custody of the girls. </p> <p>History suggests that things turned out as they should have, but Anna's suggestion that I was not the obvious choice as the twins' custodial parent found significant traction when I went back and looked at the record. I had won a tallest-midget contest with Anna, nothing more. Each of us had a history of relapse, and mine was far more extensive. The lie that I told myself \u2013 that I was made entirely new by my decision to lay off drugs \u2013 kept doubt at bay. If I really examined my fitness in all of its dimensions, I would have been paralysed. It was a fairy tale that kept me alive and allowed me to make it come true. Everything good and true about my life started on the day the twins became mine.</p> <p>When a woman, any woman, has issues with substances, has kids out of wedlock and ends up struggling as a single parent, she is identified by many names: slut, loser, welfare mum, burden on society. Take those same circumstances and array them over a man, and he becomes a crown prince. See him doing that dad thing and, with a flick of the wrist, the mum thing, too! Why is it that the same series of overt acts committed by a male becomes somehow ennobled?</p> <p>I'm not saying that raising children, especially by yourself, is a trip to Turks and Caicos, but single parenting is as old as reproduction. Families declare themselves in all sorts of versions, and ours happened to be two adorable toddlers stapled to 250lb of large, white male. Still, people who knew our circumstances marvelled at the idiosyncrasy. And people who knew me before the twins wondered all the more.</p> <p>I had no idea what I was doing, but children teach you how to care for them. Leave the house without an extra diaper, and they will have some brutal, smelly event at a McDonald's. Let them wheedle their way into your bed so you can get some rest, and you will be fighting them off every single night of their young lives. Gradually, slowly, the three of us developed a routine at bedtime, with baths, prayers and stories \u2013 stuff I had been brought up on or seen on TV. </p> <p>As we spent more time together, they began to know me, and I came to adore them \u2013 madly, deeply, truly. We developed other rituals. When it came time to actually turn out the light, I would sing a song of my own making.<br>To the tune of nothing in particular, but very up-tempo:</p> <p>'Oh, I've got the nicest girls in town,<br>I've got the nicest girls in town.<br>They are so nice, they are so sweet,<br>I love them twice, they can't be beat.'<br>And then, a real strong Broadway finish, with every note held and punished (apologies to Ethel Merman).<br>'Oh. I've. Got. The. Nicest. Girrrrrrrls.<br>Innnnnnn.<br>Townnnnnnn.'</p> <p>It was a huge hit in our crummy little upper duplex, but if that all sounds like some after-school special, with the fat ex-junkie dad singing to his misbegotten daughters, well, it is what it is.</p> <p>I always thought that people who spent endless amounts of time drilling into their personal histories are fundamentally unhappy in their lives, and I'm not. I'm ecstatic in my own dark, morbid way and subscribe to a theory of the past that allows the future to unfold: we all did the best we could.</p> <p>Even with the trope of reporting, my addiction narrative arrives at some very common lessons. Too much of a bad thing is bad. If you don't sleep and eat but drink and drug instead, you will lose jobs, spouses and dignity. And while the lessons of the recovery story are important, they are even more prosaic. Once I stopped doing narcotics and alcohol, I landed good jobs, remarried, had a baby and, of course, learned to love myself.</p> <p>Junkies and drunks frequently end up putting a megaphone to their own pratfalls in the form of a memoir because they need to believe that all of the time they spent with their lips wrapped around glass, whether it was a bottle of vodka or a crack pipe, actually meant something. That impulse suggests that I don't regret the past \u2013 it brought me here to this nice, happy place \u2013 but I'd also like to squeeze something more from it. And so I have.</p> <p>Two years of reporting and a lot of awkward conversations later, I realised that in reductive psychoanalytic terms, I had achieved a measure of integration, not just between That Guy and This Guy but between my past and my present. Carl Jung suggested that until we embrace both our masculine and feminine sides, we can't be made whole. For all the testosterone I have deployed in my affairs, I experienced salvation in expressing common maternal behaviour. You are always told to recover for yourself, but reproduction has an enormously simplifying effect on life: are you willing to destroy others, including little babies, in order to feed the monster within?</p> <p>Not in my case, but it was a much closer call than I would like to admit. I now inhabit a life I don't deserve, but we all walk this earth feeling we are frauds. The trick is to be grateful and hope the caper doesn't end any time soon.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>David Carr is a culture reporter and the media columnist for The New York Times.

  "<p>In Thailand last month an 18-year-old high-school student stabbed a taxi driver to death. When asked why, he replied that it was to see if it was as easy to rob a taxi in real life as it was in his favourite video game, Grand Theft Auto. The Thai government banned the game amid talk of a 'ticking time bomb'. Just the latest in a long-running argument about the damaging effects of violent video games.</p> <p>To objections from the gaming industry, the UK government has just introduced plans for a strict film-style classification system, which may allay parents' fears about violence but seems unlikely to address their concerns about video games in general: that they stifle creativity, hinder social skills and reduce their children to gawping couch potatoes. Video games are back in the firing line.</p> <p>Last Friday saw the release of Spore, one of the industry's most eagerly awaited games. But parents can breathe a sigh of relief, because this isn't some ultra-violent gun-toting gore fest. It's the brainchild of designer Will Wright, which means, in all likelihood, that it will totally rewrite the rules on what we can expect from a video game and prove as popular with parents as it is with kids. Through his games Wright has revolutionised the industry and more than once salvaged its reputation. With his latest he may well do so again. </p> <p>Wright, now 48, is regarded with awe by his peers (even his company Maxis, I'm told, is seen as 'mysterious', squirrelled away in Orinda, California for so long when everyone else was in Silicon Valley), because he has developed an entirely new type of video game. And out of the most unlikely material. </p> <p>SimCity, his breakthrough, is about nothing more elaborate than building a city and following the principles of good town planning. This in a market dominated by fantasy and sci-fi role-play games, sports simulations and first-person shooters. Released in 1989, SimCity (and its spin-offs) have gone on to sell a staggering 17m copies worldwide. But this is nothing compared with his follow-up, The Sims. Probably best described as an interactive doll's house, in which you look after the inhabitants, The Sims boasts sales of more than 100m copies, making it the bestselling PC game of all time. </p> <p>His latest game, Spore, is as ambitious in scope as its predecessors ('How do we deconstruct the universe?' Wright asked by way of introduction at a recent conference). Spore is based loosely on the theory of evolution. Each player starts off as a microbial cell which gradually evolves, through feeding on other organisms and picking up 'DNA points', until it wriggles out of water on to dry land. This creature then hunts and reproduces, eventually banding together to make a tribe, which in turn grows in size and then either by conquering or allying with surrounding settlements turns into a civilisation. </p> <p>Finally you advance far enough to be able to send a rocket up into space for the final stage, in which you jet about the universe in search of planets to colonise and aliens to pester. From single-cell organism to intergalactic empire in one game.</p> <p>With his slightly nerdy haircut and glasses, Wright certainly looks the part. Sitting in his office overlooking San Francisco Bay, he has one leg draped jauntily over the armrest of his chair. Glancing round, there are pointers to Spore everywhere. Pinned to his walls are images from the Hubble Space Telescope (used to recreate star clusters in the game); over his bookshelf a poster of his favourite film, 2001 (by way of homage, when players reach the final space stage, they can drop a black monolith down to the surface of other planets to freak out aliens); on his desk an entomology microscope. 'I've got one at home, too. They're much more interesting than a telescope.' What does he look at? 'Anything. You could put your hand under there and spend an hour looking at it. Fascinating.' In the corridor outside sits a battered doll's house, presumably a leftover from The Sims. </p> <p>Wright is telling me at great speed (he talks with considerable velocity) about the inspirations behind Spore. What follows is typically recondite. 'It's actually an idea you see repeated over and over,' he says. 'The idea of Powers of Ten.' This is a short film by Charles and Ray Eames from 1977 that looks at the universe on various scales, gradually zooming in from the galactic (a view of the entire Milky Way) to the microscopic (quark particles in the nucleus of a carbon atom). 'In fact, Powers of Ten wasn't the first one I discovered. The original idea came from a Dutch schoolteacher named Kees Boeke. He wrote a book in 1957 called Cosmic View: The Universe in 40 Jumps. Boeke's version was amazingly accurate for the time ...' On which he leaps up and snatches down a copy of Boeke's book from the shelf. </p> <p>Wright goes on: 'I remember explaining Spore to the execs at Electronic Arts [EA, the software company that finances and publishes the game] before we had anything to show. I was trying to explain the content, Powers of Ten and all this. It was pretty clear they had no idea what I was talking about. But they were like: \"Sure, do it.\"'</p> <p>Whether they understood or not, Electronic Arts has invested a considerable amount in the game (reportedly $20m). This is not insignificant at a time when the industry, though still thriving, is beginning to question the value of spending millions on one game (a new title, too, not a sequel), particularly given the growing popularity of cheaper, so-called 'casual games'. </p> <p>Casual games include the lucrative field of internet and mobile-phone games as well as PC and console games typified by Guitar Hero (a karaoke-style game) and Dr Kawashima's Brain Training (in which you solve various puzzles to help sharpen your mind). They are simpler in design, shorter in duration, and aimed at a more mainstream audience. The Nintendo Wii console (with its motion-sensitive remote) has been a particular hit, attracting a broad new fanbase with its range of family-friendly titles. I ask Wright how important it is to court this new type of player. 'It's probably the most important thing happening in the gaming industry. We're seeing that with the Nintendo Wii. That pressure to start serving the whole market rather than this little section.' </p> <p>Does he mean appealing to more women? 'That's a big part, but also the intergenerational market. Families. With Wii, you see kids, parents and even grandparents playing together.' Wright already has a good record on this. According to EA, 20 per cent of Sims players are over 35 and 50 per cent are female. </p> <p>For EA, there's a lot riding on Spore (particularly since the company reported losses of $95m earlier this year). At the same time, EA clearly has faith in Wright and has granted him considerable leeway. A great position to be in, I say. 'Yeah. Kind of,' Wright shrugs. 'For The Sims it was very different. I was always having to convince people it would be fun. That was almost more satisfying \u2013 as opposed to whatever stupid thing you say, everybody says: \"Great idea, go do it.\"' It has been six years in development; the big question now is whether Spore can meet those expectations. </p> <p>At this year's Comic-Con in San Diego, a conference for comic-book nerds, video gamers and hardcore Trekkies, Wright gave a speech in which he said he believed video games had a role in helping people understand sciences. Spore, he said, would make science 'accessible and not academic'. It's a recurring theme in the way he talks about his work: games as semi-educational. </p> <p>How important is it that his games teach as well as entertain? 'I'm not sure teach is the right word,' he says. 'Computer games and simulations are much more powerful [as an aid] to motivate than to teach. I'd rather have a game that got a person interested in the subject than tried to put a lot of facts into their head. It's not a matter of sugarcoating education. Education when done right is inherently fun. There shouldn't be a difference between the two. Our culture has disconnected the ideas of education and fun \u2013 and if anything, I'm trying to reconnect those two things.' </p> <p>It goes back to the way Wright himself was taught. Raised in Atlanta, Georgia, the son of a plastics engineer and an actress, Wright attended a Montessori school up to the age of nine (his 'high point of education'). 'The basis was that you wanted kids to discover principles on their own. Montessori designed toys so kids could discover aspects of maths or geometry just from playing. The kid made the discovery, and it was much more effective than the teacher coming over and saying, \"Here's Pythagorean theory,\" or whatever.' Wright has likened his own games to 'modern Montessori toys'. </p> <p>As a child, he'd immerse himself in pet subjects for months, reading everything he could. Space exploration was a passion. Another was Harry Houdini (a rub-off from his mother, who was an amateur magician. 'I learned how to pick locks,' he says). The Second World War was an obsession, too. 'I had a friend down the street \u2013 we were both into World War Two history and used to play these elaborate historical video games recreating the Battle of Kursk or whatever.' He also built a lot of models: 'ships, cars, planes, mostly from kits'.</p> <p>When Wright was nine his father died of leukaemia and he moved with his mother and younger sister to Baton Rouge, Louisiana. There he enrolled in the Episcopal High School and duly became an atheist. After graduating he took off to Louisiana State University to study architecture, transferred a few years later to Louisiana Tech for mechanical engineering, dropped out, drove a bulldozer for a summer and in 1980 landed up at New School, New York, studying robotics. Robots then led to computers: 'I got fascinated, totally dived in and learned how to programme.' Video games were taking off at the time. 'I thought: people are actually making money from these games. I'll try it. More as an intellectual challenge; I didn't expect to make money.' Wright's first game, programmed on his Commodore 64, was Raid on Bungeling Bay ('this stupid helicopter shoot 'em up') which Broderbund, a small software company, brought out in 1984. It was a fair success, earning Wright enough to live on for a couple of years. That same year, Wright married Joell Jones, the older sister of one of his friends, and two years later they had a daughter, Cassidy. (The couple have recently separated.)</p> <p>While developing Bungeling Bay, Wright became fascinated by a tangential aspect to the game. 'Underneath was a fairly elaborate simulation of factories and towns, a whole infrastructure that wasn't apparent to the player. I was having a lot more fun building that world than bombing it.' How about a game based on that, he thought, where you build your own urban environment. He threw himself into background reading. 'I uncovered the work of Jay Forrester, who wrote a book called Urban Dynamics in 1969,' Wright tells me, before citing other sources, including John Conway's 1970 Game of Life and the 'cell automata' work of a little-known scientist named Liman Wang. </p> <p>The prototype game Wright came up with was a radical departure in gaming terms. In it the player would oversee the development of an entire city, laying roads, building schools and hospitals, installing infrastructure, all the time balancing a long list of interdependent variables (crime rates, population levels, popularity ratings, taxes). Persuading software company Broderbund to back it was no breeze. 'When I first showed them SimCity they were a little confused. I got to this stage where I thought it was done, but they kept expecting it to have this win/lose element. I kept saying: \"No. This is the way it is.\"' Broderbund ended up not publishing, and it sat on Wright's shelf for a few years. </p> <p>Enter Jeff Braun, Wright's future business partner. They met in 1987 at a friend's pizza party in Alameda, California. When Wright showed him his demo, Braun got very excited. Having previously developed fonts for the computer firm Atari, Braun was keen to get into games. Here was the perfect vehicle. 'He's a very bubbly guy,' Wright says of Braun. 'He said: \"I want to play this \u2013 this is great\" and persuaded me to start this company with him to develop it.' Which they did. Two years later Maxis published SimCity. Though not an instant hit, it went on to earn $230m worldwide. </p> <p>The idea for Wright's next game came when his house burned down in an Oakland Hills fire in 1991. Forced to replace all his possessions \u2013 everything from kitchen utensils to furniture, which he hated doing \u2013 Wright got thinking about the value of all this stuff. Which sparked an idea: a game about running a household. But how to make it work? Wright read extensively on human behaviour and systems design: books like A Pattern Language by Christopher Alexander, A Theory of Human Motivation by Abraham Maslow and Maps of the Mind by Charles Hampden-Turner, which provided guiding principles for scoring the happiness of players in the game he came up with. </p> <p>The Sims, based in a suburban home, required that players tend to the various needs \u2013 from dietary to social \u2013 of its family of inhabitants. That meant everything from taking them to the bathroom and getting them to clean, to cooking them dinner. Arguably Wright's greatest achievement was making housework fun. Launched in 2000, The Sims was an instant hit. <br>Three years earlier, Maxis had been bought out by Electronic Arts for $125m. Wright walked away from the deal with a reported $17m in EA stock. The Sims and its spin-offs have since gone on to earn EA in the region of $4bn. </p> <p>A month now before Spore ships, the pressure on the team at Spore HQ is easing up. The main office \u2013 airy, wood-beamed and half empty today \u2013 is covered with Spore flowcharts, storyboards and brainstorming sessions. For Wright, there's time to pause, too, though not for long \u2013 an exhaustive promotional world tour kicks off in a few weeks. 'I prefer to be making the game than talking about it,' he says.</p> <p>Does it bother him that video games are looked down on by so many? 'There are two ways of looking at that. Yeah, this bias against this form of media causes tension. But at the same time, there's some value in being a renegade. Like rock'n'roll. Something that parents don't like, kids are much more into it.' But if video games are rock'n'roll, I say, his games are more like the Beatles than, say ... 'Metallica?' he chimes in. 'Probably. My games tend to be more cross-generational. More accessible. I think parents would rather see their kids play The Sims than Counter-Strike.' No wonder. The first is about family life, the second a violent terrorist-based first-person shooter. </p> <p>But Wright is quick to defend games like Counter-Strike. 'It's funny,' he says. 'If [parents] are just observing the game and not playing it themselves, they're just seeing a surface representation: the pixels on the screen, the explosions, the gunshots. But if you look at kids playing Counter-Strike or [another first-person shooter] Quake, it's really more of a sport. They're very social experiences; they're not antisocial at all. It's all about working together as a team, getting their friends together \u2013 sometimes it's more like playing a game of basketball. If parents could see what the kids were seeing on the screen in a social sense, they would have a totally different perspective on it.' </p> <p>Agree or not, it's Wright in a nutshell. The Montessori defence, you might say: nothing beats playing the game yourself \u2013 and every game, violent or not, has something to teach us. Providing we have a go.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Spore is on sale now</p>",
  "<p>Inside Denver's sold-out, packed-to-the-girders, cacophonously loud Invesco stadium, it's a few minutes to showtime. The crowd are shouting and singing and chanting and doing the Mexican wave. 'YES WE CAN!' they roar, unprompted, repeatedly. You can't buy beer today (although bags of Original Presidential Roast coffee are available from the merchandise stalls, $10 a pop) but everyone's drunk on excitement. Or wired on the nachos' neon-orange cheese sauce. </p> <p>The support acts have done their turns: the soul icon (Stevie Wonder), the Starbucks folkie (Sheryl Crow), the conscious R&amp;B brainbox (John Legend), the celebrity hip hopper (Black Eyed Peas' will.i.am), the baby-boomer comfort-crooner (Michael McDonald).</p> <p>Up on the roofs, the Swat spotters scan the vast arena with binoculars. Down on the floor, there's a minor kerfuffle as the Rev Al Sharpton arrives. Agents in suits and sunglasses touch their earpieces. There's George Lucas. Spike Lee's in the house, declaring the night is 'bigger than the Super Bowl!' There's Jin from Lost, Jessica Alba from Hollywood, Shawn Johnson from the Olympics (the gold medal-winning gymnast recites the Pledge of Allegiance). Al Gore, a bunch of generals, President Eisenhower's granddaughter and various Washington big-hitters file on and off stage. </p> <p>But it's the musicians who have kept the six hour show on the road until the headline act arrives. There has been no sign of Joss Stone, who will be singing on an election song, but Fergie has been spotted, so it's not all good news. American Idol runner-up turned Oscar-winner Jennifer Hudson sang'The Star-Spangled Banner'. It was the second Denver gig for five-time-Grammy-winner Legend, who earlier in the week had unveiled a new song, 'If You're Out There', which had been billed as 'an anthemic call to action and evocation of human potential'. It went: 'We're the generation/ We can't afford to wait/ The future started yesterday/ And we're already late.'<br> Me and California indie-blues band Cold War Kids, we're already late too. Mainly because we've spent the afternoon standing in the longest queue I've ever experienced. In 89C heat we shuffled round parking lots, along back alleys, down grassy knolls, into narrowed pens. We were harangued en route by all manner of pedlars (everything from souvenir water to souvenir hand-towels) and protesters waving banners: Bring The Troops Home; Don't Invade Iran; Impeach Bush; Forget John McCain, Love Hillary Clinton; Forget Hillary Clinton, Love Jesus; No, Love Communism. And we were shepherded all the way by an army of cops.</p> <p>We did this, the shuffle-queuing, for three hours. That's what happens when 84,000 people turn up to hear a senator speak, and when the Secret Service are checking everyone's bags. That's what happens when Barack Obama comes to town, to the home of the Denver Broncos American football team, to deliver the most important speech of his career. Welcome to stadium politics. It's like stadium rock, only the sound is better.</p> <p>This is, as one of the most popular T-shirts has it, Barack And Roll. And this is Denver, Colorado during the Democratic National Convention 2008, the four-day razzmatazz event at which the party officially selects Obama as its candidate to fight November's presidential election against the Republicans' Vietnam war hero John McCain. The legacy of two epochal events hangs in the ether: Obama is speaking on the 45th anniversary of Martin Luther King's 'I Have a Dream' speech, and it's 40 years since Chicago '68, the infamous Democratic Convention that followed the assassination of another People's Politician, Robert F Kennedy , and which descended into brutally suppressed riots.</p> <p>All over town there are rallies, meetings, parties, protests, law enforcement of every stripe and gun calibre, and 15,000 representatives of the global media. The celebrity contingent ranges from Ben Affleck and Charlize Theron to Muhammad Alivia the hot-ticket Vanity Fair bash. The accredited bloggers, all 500 of them, have their own tent. That's a lot of hot air and electromagnetic radiation zooming up into the Rocky Mountains. No wonder everyone in the Mile High City this week is a little, well, crazed. And there are bands. Rage Against the Machine do a free gig then lead 5,000 anti-war protesters on a demo. NERD play a Rock the Vote show. Kanye West performs a keynote concert, as is increasingly usual for him, way past everyone's bedtime. And it's not just the hip hop community who are turning out for the politico with Jay-Z on his iPod and on speed dial. The indie kids are here in force, too, with Cold War Kids joining Jenny Lewis, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah! and Death Cab For Cutie at a hipster art event called Manifest Hope. Beat that, Cool Britannia.</p> <p>Manifest Hope encompasses an exhibition and two gigs: an open-air early evening freebie and a late night 'VIP invite-only' show with Zooey Deschanel, the Hollywood actress who, as She &amp; Him, made the recent (and very good) album Volume One with singer-songwriter M Ward. Support comes from super-hot comedian Sarah Silverman, and from the mayor of Seattle (who mentions his city's proud grunge heritage).</p> <p>The DNC '08 is a rock'n'roll event for a rock'n'roll candidate, who has been feted on the cover of Rolling Stone and Spin. The singalong slogans are all over the place, on T-shirts, posters and banners. Barack The Vote. The New American Dream. A Legacy Of Hope. Change We Can Believe In. It's Time! The Real Deal. Obama In The House. Rock'n'roll candidate: that sounds fatuous, but it's still true. Obama \u2013 young, gifted and black \u2013 is treated like a rock star by the cool kids. Boy, do they think he's a rock star.</p> <p>'Portraiture is something I've always done of my music heroes \u2013 Joe Strummer, Bob Marley, Joey Ramone, Henry Rollins,' says Shepard Fairey, 38. He's the Los Angeles-based graphic artist whose stature in the US is akin to Banksy's here. Inspired by the presidential hopeful's message, Fairey designed two posters, titled Hope and Change. He's wearing a badge that says 'Obama' in the font used by AC/DC. 'My Obama poster is in the tradition of my work, to put people I think are trailblazers on a pedestal.'</p> <p>The posters were an instant pop-culture and blogosphere sensation in the US, and Fairey received a personally signed thank you note from Obama. They catalysed this week's Manifest Hope exhibition: a collection of Obama art submitted by creative figures from the graffiti, hip hop and urban scenes. It fills 10,000sq ft of gallery space in a grungily cool Denver neighbourhood. 'Just look around the exhibition at all these images of him,' says David Choe, 32, from New York, who contributed a spraycan work titled Hussein (Obama's middle name). 'He's not even human any more, he's like Jesus. He's become a symbol.'</p> <p>Why are Cold War Kids \u2013 whose Robbers &amp; Cowards debut was one of the critical hits of 2006 , and who share management with the White Stripes and Vampire Weekend \u2013 here? </p> <p>'We have always thought that the size of your band is directly in proportion to the size of your influence,' says singer Nathan Willett . It's an obvious point but stick with him; Cold War Kids are viscerally exciting on record (imagine Tom Waits fronting a de-techno'd Radiohead) but they're sober and methodical in speech. 'To be a political band without having any influence is really kinda silly and dogmatic,' he continues. 'But if you have influence and you can use it productively, that's great.' With their imminent second album, Loyalty to Loyalty, attracting advance raves, the savvy band are aware of their burgeoning heft \u2013 and of the promotional/fun possibilities. 'We're newly in a place where we have a little spotlight. And,' Willett adds, 'it's nice to play a little party.' Especially a party taking place during an event at which history is being made.</p> <p>The day before Barack Obama's Invesco Field speech, the Manifest Hope street bash is teeming. Will.i.am tours the exhibition; earlier this year he created the Obama mash-up 'Yes We Can ' featuring extracts from the senator's speeches and vocals from, among others, Scarlett Johansson. Spike Lee has already swung by, reportedly buying myriad prints of the exhibited art.</p> <p>At the entrance to the gallery is a poster declaring Obama a 'champion of the arts', and setting out his platform in this area. This includes: creating an arts corps that will work in low-income schools and communities; supporting increased funding for the National Endowment For the Arts (whose budget has been cut from $175m per annum in 1992 to $125m pa today); and providing healthcare and ensuring tax fairness for artists. No wonder the arts community are firmly onside. </p> <p>'Before Obama kids were not rocking politicians on their T-shirts and buying posters,' says artist Sam Flores, 32, from San Francisco, who has contributed New America, an acrylic and aerosol artwork to the show. 'But art and music and urban culture is helping bring them in \u2013 now everyone is making an effort to be part of politics. It's not just because he's the first black candidate \u2013 he represents ideas and openness.'</p> <p>The political thinking behind the exhibition, says excited gallery co-owner Tom Horne, is to say to young people: 'If these awesome, world famous, rad artists are getting together for this cause, YOU CAN TOO!'</p> <p>New York artist Ron English's Abraham Obama is one of the most striking pieces (his point, he says, is that the allegedly 'inexperienced' senator of four years standing has just as much experience of office as did America's favourite President). At 49, English is less prone to being swept up in the giddy Obamania. 'Most smart politicians in history, even the most evil ones like Hitler, used music and art,' he says. ''Cause art and music is how you get to people's hearts and souls.'</p> <p>Cold War Kids are also wary of being reduced to Obama cheerleaders. Formerly students at a Christian college, they're more about ideas than political partisanship \u2013 they wouldn't necessarily be turning up for congratulatory drinkies at the White House. Their second album's title, Loyalty to Loyalty, was inspired by the writings of Josiah Royce , a late 19th-century philosopher and proto-socialist from California. They're big fans of author David Foster Wallace , quoting on their website his thoughts on how the most effective new rebels might be the ones with old fashioned values.<br> 'The biggest objective Wallace wants to get across is to turn away from a style of writing that is ironical and sarcastic,' says Willett, 'and point towards a much more genuine and sincere style of communication. A lot of people have talked about that with Obama \u2013 from his mannerisms to his speech, he's a very sincere guy, a genuine character.</p> <p>Like U2 in a suit, Obama's sincerity and abstract but powerful quasi-spiritual messages \u2013 Change We Can Believe In; Yes We Can \u2013 are certainly inspiring near-fanatical enthusiasm among youth voters previously untouched, in every sense, by politics.</p> <p>Annie, 20, and Sam Woods, 24, have put their hearts, souls and lives into Obama. Sam spent two days covering her 1990 Volvo 240 DL in 520 Obama stickers. The sisters then drove the 1,200 miles to Denver from their home in Santa Cruz, California, blogging and selling stencilled Obama T-shirts along the way. Out in the street, as the bands soundcheck in the late afternoon heat, there is a huge buzz of interest in the sisters' car. They hand out cards for their Drive the Movement website (<a href=\"http://www.obamamobileusa.com\">obamamobileusa.com</a>). Why have they done all this? </p> <p>'Because change happens from the bottom up,' says Annie, 'and we want to be part of that. Obama is historic. What's happening now is monumental.'<br> 'Before Obama politics was this exclusive, I-have-money-and-we're-gonna-rule type government,' says Sam. 'Whereas now it's flipped \u2013 young people are involved, and all these artists and musicians are coming from the ground up and being inspired.' </p> <p>I hear similar zeal from the eager fans watching Cold War Kids that evening. Their short outdoor set \u2013 introduced by the mayor of Long Beach (like a proper politico, he's riding the slipstream of his up'n'coming hometown boys) and watched by the mayor of San Francisco (who looks like a catalogue model, or Eighties TV character Max Headroom) \u2013 is brilliant. Willett, bass player Matt Maust , guitarist Jonnie Russell and drummer Matt Aveiro throw themselves into the turbulent likes of the last album's 'Hang Me Up to Dry ' and the new one's 'Welcome to the Occupation '. </p> <p>'It's really important to see bands like Cold War Kids playing \u2013 we respect them and so we respect the things they stand up for,' says Sam Britten, 23, from Denver as they troop off stage. She's wearing a T-shirt made by a local artist. 'It's Time For A Democratic Party', it says, over a picture of Obama. While in college she helped register voters, focusing on 18- to 24-year-olds. 'And we could do nothing to get them to the polls or care about the issues. But here there are entire galleries in Denver filled with art devoted to Obama.' White-haired, 72-year-old millionaire John McCain, 'he can't do that!'</p> <p>'I'm here 'cause I love music, and I love Obama,' says Nasir Malik, a 20-year-old local with an Obama badge pinned to his baseball cap. 'He incites change. I've never felt that before, not in the right way. Good change, not a negative change.' </p> <p>Julia Rosen, 27, from Sacramento, is wearing a T-shirt that says 'I Blogged Your Girlfriend'. She's covering the convention for political website Calitics. 'As bloggers, the Obama campaign have empowered us to be their spokespeople. And they've very much decentralised the campaign. Young people are not watching the nightly news or reading newspapers much, so they get their news from alternative sources, whether that's The Daily Show or musicians or other trusted sources. They'll be like, \"Oh yeah, Cold War Kids were talking up Obama last night and the concert was awesome.\" Them telling five friends that, who then tell five other friends, that's what's going to get the youth out to vote and win him the election.' </p> <p>But what if all this is just ammo for the Republican charge that Barack Obama is just a celebrity? A smiley fella who likes the limelight and the famous supporters more than he likes the nitty-gritty of reforming tax policy, weaning America off its oil addiction and sorting out the mess in Iraq and Afghanistan?</p> <p>Ron English, artist: 'The only reason he's a \"celebrity\" is because people love him.'</p> <p>Jonnie Russell, Cold War Kid: 'It's definitely a danger, a slippery slope. But it happens on both sides \u2013 you've got Ted Nugent supporting the Republicans.'</p> <p>Shepard Fairey, artist: 'The concept of \"celebrity\" is that they're elite and untouchable. That's not Obama.'</p> <p>Sam Wood, activist: 'Is Obama a celebrity or a rock star? Hey, aren't we all rock stars? I don't think it should hurt him. It should empower people, the fact that he has that image. For years our presidents have been old white guys. He's in touch with our generation.'</p> <p>The following night's event at Invesco Stadium is a thrilling thing to behold. It is more rock'n'roll than any actual stadium concert I've ever been to. Once the deafening cheers greeting his arrival on stage have eventually subsided, Barack Obama rises to the occasion, showing his teeth at last and laying into McCain with a series of trenchant critiques and funny one-liners. No more Mr Nice Guy. And he off ers up impressive detail on a range of policy changes. No more Mr Celebrity. Well, as non-celebrity as the star of one of the biggest speeches by a politician in recent American history can be. At home, 38.4 million Americans are watching on TV. </p> <p>Inside this huge arena, the 84,000 excited fans lap up Obama's 45-minute set. If he could have done an encore (one short, catchy paragraph, say), they'd have gone even crazier. Then, a family hug, fireworks, confetti cannon and a vast, fluttering ocean of American flags. And there's one final musical trick: as Obama leaves the stage, Bruce Springsteen's 'Born in the USA' blares out across the stadium. Finally, a more fitting political context after the Reagan Republicans' mid-Eighties' misappropriation of The Boss's blue collar anthem.</p> <p>As we file out, a teenage girl approaches Cold War Kid Matt Maust and asks for an autograph. Alyson King, 16, is from Long Beach too. She came all this way for the Convention; seeing a show last night by a band from her hometown was an awesome bonus.</p> <p>Does she think an indie band can help the Democrats win the presidency after eight years of Bush?</p> <p>'Cold War Kids playing totally helps the cause. It gets the word out. As an artist, a public figure, you have to carry some responsibility and stand up to the challenges that face society.'</p> <p>And how was the Obama show?</p> <p>'Oh,' she beams, 'he rocked.'</p> <p>We filed out into the balmy, barmy Denver night. It's all over \u2013 bar the voting.</p> <h2>Obama V McCain: The music battle</h2> <p>Both presidential candidates recently revealed their 10 favourite songs and one - Barack Obama - is clearly more the rocker.

  "<p>Scientists have developed a scanner that can pinpoint explosives and weapons hidden in the shoes, clothing and luggage of terrorists as they walk around airport terminals.</p> <p>The system - created by researchers led by Professor Wuqiang Yang of Manchester University - can detect devices instantly. Moreover, it does not require travellers to take off their shoes or place luggage on conveyor-belt detectors. Instead, security staff will be able to spot terrorists with knives in their jackets or explosives in their backpacks as they move around the departure lounges.</p> <p>News of the scanner's development comes after last week's convictions of three British men for conspiracy to murder in a case in which defendants were accused of trying to smuggle bomb-making materials onto aircraft inside cabin luggage. The alleged plot, in August 2006, led to a global security clampdown at airports that has resulted in severe restrictions - still in place - on carrying liquids in hand luggage.</p> <p>As a result, the scanner has triggered considerable interest among US defence chiefs, who are investing billions of dollars on research into detectors that might improve airport safety. At the request of UK security officials, a prototype has been sent to be tested at Dallas airport.</p> <p>'I will be going out soon to run demonstration tests,' said Yang. 'Once it has been properly developed, our device would cost only a few thousand pounds and could be installed under carpets, tiles or flooring in airports to detect shoe bombs without the use of radar or cameras. It is also capable of learning the characteristics of new threat substances - including explosives and non-metallic weapons - when developed by terrorists.'</p> <p>Yang said his team was also working on hand-held versions of the detector that could be used to screen abandoned luggage or to scan envelopes and parcels delivered to companies.</p>",
  "<p>Everyone on the longlist for the Man Booker Prize knew that some time on Wednesday afternoon or Thursday morning the week before the official announcement of the shortlist there would be a call. Or there would be no call. You knew you would be sitting there in diminishing optimism that your publisher would ring to say you'd made it and that when the phone did ring, and you're silly with hope, it's American Express touting unemployment protection insurance which you don't need because you're not employed in any sense the policy can find in its own definitions. </p> <p>I do not do well with delayed expectation. I had spent the previous weekend successfully arguing myself off the shortlist by assigning in my own mind all the available six places to the novels I was sure the judges would choose. My methodology was the erratically successful scheme of trying to psychoanalyse people I'd never met to determine what kind of fiction would move them. It's just an extension of the futile pastime of sitting on the tube driving yourself mad trying to work out what the person opposite you is thinking; but that's the problem with being a writer, you spend far too much time inside your own head.</p> <p>My capacity for doing more or less nothing is infinitely elastic. I used to lie around on the sofa staring into space, smoking and daydreaming, and now I just lie around daydreaming. There will come a point when, like Stephen Tennant, I will live in bed. But with daydreams come nightmares, and at midday on that Wednesday the Guardian rang to ask if I could fill in at short notice for another columnist. I said yes because although I have few opinions I thought it would anaesthetise the waiting. And what would I write about? American friends, one a Manhattan Democrat, the other a small-town Republican, had been trying to explain to me how the two Americas saw each other, in mutual incomprehension. Sneering at rural hicks didn't seem to me the best strategy for winning their hearts and minds, but the values of the conservative right are surely too insular to cope with the challenging future of a warming, warring planet. </p> <p>An hour or so later, when I was about halfway through, the phone rang. 'It's good,' said my publisher, enigmatically and it took a couple of clarifying questions to establish that I had made the shortlist. My interest in rural versus urban America lay on the floor and died, leaving a few specks of dust and a cobweb. My agent rang, my publicist rang, my publisher rang again, I rang the tiny number of family and friends I was allowed to tell, and each call alternated with writing half a sentence of the final paragraph. I had forgotten that it would appear online. The next day someone signing himself 'hilter' had gone crazy with a virtual shotgun in the comments: FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK THE JEW BITCH UP THE ASS. Then he fell silent. Perhaps he'd shot himself in the head with a real rifle. Hope so. </p> <p>The weekend felt muted, fogbound. The papers were full of certainty about who would make the shortlist and there you are, with reality locked up inside you, sworn to secrecy. The announcement when it finally came at noon on Tuesday was like opening a door into a brilliantly lit room, blinking. Generous messages arrived from other writers who might themselves have hoped to be on the list, but I was sorry not to see Michelle De Kretser's name there. We had been paired to do a session together at the Hay festival last June and found we were uniquely simpatico in our themes and preoccupations, showing that our very different stories bear the same ideas, of the outsider, the immigrant, the need to survive at all costs. </p> <p>It was Salman Rushdie who took the full brunt of the media's assault, the pundits astonished yet gleeful that he'd been left off. The shortlist was attacked for being too populist, a pleasant change from the years when it had been attacked for being obscure, dry and unreadable. The bookies scrambled to recalculate the odds. I'm 3-1 at Ladbrokes. Last time I was on the longlist, in 2002, I put a bet on Yann Martell with William Hill and won \u00a3200. 'Not putting a bet on yourself?' said the bookie. I didn't think so. If you win the prize you won't need the money, whereas if you lose you've had the consolation of having made a few bob. A few months later he sent me a very nice letter saying he'd read my book and liked it and was a bit of a writer himself and would I take a look at the opening chapter of his work-in-progress?</p> <p>The morning of the shortlist announcement I was sitting in the very chair which is customarily occupied by Trinny and Susannah, both clients of my hairdresser who does the makeovers for What Not to Wear. Party hair, I told him. 'What's the occasion?' he asked, and then of course wanted to know what my novel was about. I tend to use the Peter Rachman shorthand; it's loosely based not so much on his life but the contradictions of his story, the notorious slum landlord who was a Holocaust survivor. (People are continuously asking if the book is autobiographical. Yes, I reply, it's based on my experience as a pre-war Budapest pimp and Notting Hill slum landlord.) My hairdresser recognises the name. 'Wasn't he involved in the Profumo affair?' he asks. Rachman was the lover of both Mandy Rice-Davies and Christine Keeler. Mandy was the last person to see him alive, the night before his death in 1962. </p> <p>'I've done Mandy and Christine's hair for years,' he says. Me, Trinny, Susannah and the other pair, whose 15 minutes of fame has left a lifelong afterglow, lighting but not really illuminating. These days, of course, they'd have gone on Celebrity Big Brother and Mandy Rice-Davies would have won. </p> <p>Candace Bushnell's new novel, One Fifth Avenue, has a famous-overnight writer self-googling after a rave review in the New York Times comparing him to Melville. She likens this secret, solitary and addictive pastime to self-harm, teenage girls slashing their arms: you do it in order to feel a strong sensation, and that sensation is almost never pleasure but pain, rage, horror. Inevitably, I self-google to find out the response to the Booker and discover instead that the piece I had totally forgotten about writing for the Guardian last week has set alight the US blogosphere. There are some angry people out there, besides the ones who just think I should mind my own business. I'm an ugly Commie bitch, one of the snooty European elites. </p> <p>My Republican friend emails and tells me to ignore the nutters, and then makes a prediction: 'Remember, since Kennedy, only three Democrats have been elected President: LBJ = Small town, folksy Texas blowhard; Jimmy Carter = Small town, folksy Georgia blowhard; Billy Jeff Clinton = Small town, folksy Arkansas blowhard.' Sarah Palin will be next but one President of the United States.</p> <h2>The Grant CV</h2> <p><strong>The Life</strong> Born in Liverpool, to Russian and Polish Jewish immigrants.

  "<p><strong>Barclays in transfer market</strong></p> <p>The fact that Barclays' name was once again being touted as one of the possible saviours for Lehman Brothers owes more to the City's fears that it is still determined to do a deal, having lost ABN Amro, than to any appetite from Barclays Capital boss Bob Diamond or chief executive John Varley to get embroiled in US mortgages and bond distribution. The bank has already proved a safe haven for disaffected dealing teams from ABN Amro and Bear Stearns, and is doubtless already ringing up disaffected Lehman staff and salivating over the business which may now come its way.</p> <p><strong>Bargain basement</strong></p> <p>Lehman Brothers' market value on Friday was around $2.5bn (\u00a31.4bn, yet it has cash of $60bn (\u00a333.5bn) and its offices in London and New York alone are worth more than that. That puts the \u00a371bn which the British banking sector has lost in the year since Northern Rock collapsed, according to Digital Look, into context. Bradford &amp; Bingley and Alliance &amp; Leicester, not surprisingly, have been the biggest losers, while HSBC stock has actually risen by 2.5 per cent. And with a secure 5.3 per cent yield, it still looks a safe bet. </p> <p><strong>Wired for success</strong></p> <p>Internet successes come in unlikely places. Premier Farnell, a rather dull distributor of electronic components, is doing rather well from pushing its web-based offering.

  "<p>You could call it the curse of the league tables. Mark Lyttleton's Blackrock Absolute Alpha fund was the best-selling retail fund in last year's Isa season, given that it appeared to be able to defy the plunging market. From its launch in April 2005 until the end of March this year, it rose by almost 40 per cent, comfortably outstripping the 14 per cent rise in the FTSE 100 index over the same period. Even more impressive was Lyttleton's ability to shrug off market falls: between March 2007 and March 2008, the stock market fell by around 10 per cent, but the fund was up almost 12 per cent. That has helped it to rake in \u00a31.5bn in short order.</p> <p>During the summer, however, Lyttleton has had what he describes as the 'worst three months' of his career, coming hard on the heels of his best-ever 12 months. According to Morningstar statistics, the fund has fallen by 2.61 per cent over that period. That may not sound bad compared with the 7 per cent or so fall in the stock market over the same period. Other funds have lost much more: Neil Woodford's Invesco Perpetual Income, one of the most reliable performers, is down more than 4 per cent over the same period. And investors who have held the fund for six months or more should still be happy. But while Blackrock Absolute Alpha would never have promised investors that it would always be in positive territory, its very name suggests to investors that that is what they should expect. And Lyttleton admits they will be disappointed.</p> <p>The problem lies mainly with his conviction that global companies would do better than domestically focused ones. While that was the right bet for much of the last two years, the hints that interest rates and inflation may be nearing their peak - combined with the US bail-out of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae - have sent domestic consumer-related stocks rising again, while commodity and oil stocks, which are among Lyttleton's favourites, have been tumbling. Market volatility has also been high: Lyttleton says that many shares have fallen by 15 or even 30 per cent in just a few days and that while he may have been shorting some of these - and benefiting from the falls - he was also long, and therefore took the hit. </p> <p>So should investors be worried? Not at all, say advisers. First, no one should buy an investment fund, no matter whether it is absolute return or not, on a three-month time horizon. Market conditions have been among the worst ever this year, so the fact that the fund has fallen so little should be seen as a positive. Indeed, if it makes investors and advisers realise that even absolute return funds can lose money on occasion, Lyttleton's recent stumbles will be no bad thing.</p> <p>Tim Cockerill, head of research at Rowan, says he is not at all worried about the losses. 'Absolute Alpha is always going to underperform if the market takes off. We have seen that happening. Indeed, if it had been performing in line, we should be asking questions. There is no magic formula.' </p> <p>Mark Dampier of financial advisers Hargreaves Lansdown thinks investors should have a range of absolute return funds in their portfolios, as they do for other funds. The problem is, there is not that much choice. Dampier points to Cazenove's UK Absolute fund, run by Tim Russell, who takes the opposite view on oil and mining stocks to Lyttleton. But it only launched in July, so has no established track record.</p> <p>Standard Life was last week promoting its Global Absolute Returns Strategies fund, which has been available to institutional investors since 2006 - and has grown from \u00a320m to \u00a3720m in that period. Now being opened to the retail market, it differs from the other two in using asset allocation strategies - like the dollar against the euro, or the FTSE 100 compared with the FTSE 250 - rather than shorting individual stocks or markets. But the aim, like the others, is to produce a positive return, over the medium to long term, in all market conditions.</p> <p>Cockerill prefers funds to have a bit of a track record before he will consider them, so is keen to see how Standard's fund will fare in different market conditions. Those considering buying them should be aware that, as Lyttleton's experience shows, they cannot always buck the markets. Losses are inevitable at some point - and they will never shoot the lights out as a conventional equity fund can. But they certainly have a place in a diversified portfolio.</p> <p>Plunging stock markets have also sent investors running to the kind of structured products which guarantee that you will not lose money, but promise to let you share in the profits should they start to rise again. These are particularly popular with banks, which regularly promote new issues to their customers.</p> <p>Dick Saunders, chief executive of the Investment Management Association, thinks they should not be taken in. He points out that these products are very opaque: the costs are never made clear to those who buy them and, because there is no requirement to publish performance figures, it is not clear what kind of returns investors are actually getting. </p> <p>One of the few to produce statistics is National Savings &amp; Investments and an analysis of its returns by the association shows that, after taking account of charges, their returns are much more similar to those expected from a cash deposit account than from a stock market product. </p> <p>'While the products offer a guarantee against the index falling over a five-year period, that is a relatively unusual event,' said Saunders. 'The index has, of course, seen significant falls since 2000, though it is currently over 30 per cent higher than its level of five years ago. But before 2002, the last time it was down over five years was in 1978. Investors may not realise just how much return they are giving up in order to be protected against what is a rare event.' </p> <p>Of course Saunders's organisation exists to promote investment funds and even the most cautiously managed of these can end up losing money when stock markets, or the managers' skills, are poor. But he is surely right to complain about the lack of regulations and guidelines for their sale when so many other parts of the investment market are enmeshed in red tape. The simple fact is that, if you are scared enough of the stock market to be tempted by these products, your money is best left in a building society.</p>",
  "<p>'A lot of property people thought they were geniuses,' observed one of the industry's best-known tycoons. 'Perhaps they're reassessing that view right now.'</p> <p>For the last 15 years, you did not have to be a genius to make money from property. It was a pursuit at which almost anyone on the IQ spectrum could succeed. In fact making money from property was as easy as securing the debt from banks to fund purchases.</p> <p>And in the commercial market, banks were doing their utmost to make it extremely easy to get the requisite finance. British and Irish institutions gleefully chucked money at the sector, seemingly forgetting that it was over-exposure to property in the early Nineties that destroyed their balance sheets. Indeed, they seemed to be in fierce competition to see who could fund the most property-backed deals.</p> <p>The pace of bank lending was frenetic. In the past six years UK bank exposure to real estate has more than tripled - to \u00a3232bn by June this year, according to Bank of England statistics. The true figure is a great deal higher, however. That \u00a3232bn just covers banks with a UK presence. Add in international institutions and there is a total of at least \u00a3300bn worth of outstanding bank loans on commercial property. </p> <p>That's fine during a debt-fuelled boom. But since July last year, when it became clear the global financial system was at risk, capital values have fallen 20 per cent according to Savills, the property consultant, and by even more in sub-sectors like retail property.</p> <p>As prices collapse, the banks have a major headache because most commercial purchases, like house mortgages, are funded with a relatively small amount of equity. So a 20 per cent fall in value means that in most cases bank debt exceeds the worth of the building. </p> <p>Given the precarious nature of their balance sheets this is a bad situation for banks, but not disastrous so long as the interest on loans continues being paid by tenants. But when tenants default - in other words, go bust - a deeper commercial property downturn will begin.</p> <p>We are just approaching that point now: stand by for the next leg of the credit crunch. It will see the nightmare scenario of banks forcing fire sales of offices, shopping centres and industrial units to recoup cash. In all likelihood they will have no other option. What happened to Lehman Brothers last week may well be a sign of things to come for UK institutions.</p> <p>The alternative, waiting for the storm to pass, will result in further writedowns on already collapsed balance sheets. One senior banker said that the Bank of England was discreetly advising banks to pursue forced property sales.</p> <p>According to various property insiders the fire sales are already beginning. One property banker suggested that the need to get cash in was now so urgent that one of the Scottish banks was forcing the liquidation of a vast industrial property portfolio - and at a knockdown price.</p> <p>Loans to fund the most expensive building in the UK, Plantation Place off Fenchurch Street in the City of London, bought in 2006 for \u00a3527m by Invista Foundation Property Trust and Tishman International, are in default and banks are demanding more equity or - more likely - a sale.</p> <p>'At last the banks are facing up to it,' said one seasoned property banker working for a major US institution. 'It's just a question of what price they're prepared to take.'</p> <p>A chief executive of a major UK-quoted property firm said: 'I'm aware there have been a few more instances of banks forcing property companies to sell. I do believe there will be more distressed sales. We do expect there to be more tenant defaults.'</p> <p>Those most affected are the Scottish and Irish banks. HBOS has a \u00a3109bn loan book, lending \u00a340bn to construction and real estate companies, of which \u00a33bn has gone to house builders. It has also amassed a \u00a34bn unlisted equity portfolio, with many of the stakes in housebuilders and other property-related companies. It has written down the value of its loans to the house-building sector by \u00a3100m. That figure, though, is likely to increase significantly. </p> <p>Royal Bank of Scotland is in a similar position, having lent money to a huge number of property-backed businesses.</p> <p>A senior property banker said: 'The two Scottish banks were competing against each other in terms of scale. They are the most affected by all this despite their recapitalisations.'</p> <p>Anglo Irish, with a \u20ac69bn (\u00a355bn) property loan book, is considered by many to be exposed. In the past, it has driven the bonanza in the Irish housing sector and its loan book extends to the UK, where it has been among the most prolific lenders.</p> <p>Last week JP Morgan downgraded the entire Irish banking sector, where shares have fallen 45 per cent so far this year on top of a 35 per cent crash in 2007. But the cost of insuring Anglo Irish debt is much higher than its peers, reflecting concern over its potential vulnerability.</p> <p>So far, there have been no corporate casualties in the property sector. Traditionally in a downturn the first to go under are the developers, followed by leveraged buyers. One of the most exposed quoted developers in the UK is Quintain, which is building 10,000 homes on the Greenwich Peninsula around the Millennium Dome, now known as the O2, and thousands of houses around Wembley Stadium. </p> <p>Another is Minerva, a City property developer which has already shelved a major skyscraper project, the Minerva Tower.</p> <p>There has been next to no buying or selling of property for the past six months, but this stasis could end imminently as banks decide to cut their losses and replace the binge with a vicious detox.</p>",
  "<p>Let's be honest: there is still (credit crunch notwithstanding) some trolley-shopping sneering at cans and frozen food. From an eco point of view, some of this is appropriate. Overall, the electricity consumption of our domestic fridges and freezers creates 62m tonnes of CO2-equivalent emissions per year (that's 2 per cent of total greenhouse gas emissions for the EU). In common with fridges, freezers need a coolant to work, and the coolant of choice is hydrofluorocarbon (HFC), a gas with a global-warming potential 3,200 times greater than CO2. </p> <p>Otherwise the opprobrium is quite inappropriate. Take peas, for example. We eat 100,000 tonnes of frozen peas a year, predominantly from British farms, blast-frozen in a tunnel at -25C two and half hours after harvesting. OK, this is an energy-intensive practice, and granted, this is not exactly a cottage industry - Birds Eye (recently sold by Unilever to private equity giant Permira) dominates. But compare it to the other popular alternative of flying mangetout from Africa in winter (some 6,000 miles), and add in the issue of whether the land used to grow this food for export should be used for local food production - and frozen looks virtuous. </p> <p>Besides, frozen needn't mean reconstituted veg and arctic rolls, as anybody who has a good allotment will tell you. Its core use should be to freeze local or homegrown surpluses to tide you through the winter.</p> <p>Canned produce suffers from a similar image problem. Admittedly, a lot of energy is expended in the canning process, turning gas into steam; the Heinz canning site at Kitt Green, near Wigan which processes some 1.34bn cans a year needs around 140 tonnes of steam per hour - and that's a hugely efficient factory.</p> <p>But the big ecological get-out-of-jail-free card is that canned food allows us, the consumer, to pre-cycle. Unlike with plastic, with its woeful array of indecipherable triangle symbols and different polymers, we largely know we can recycled tins into an established system. Most tins now contain around 25 per cent recycled material. </p> <p>But which is better, frozen or canned? While tins of food will sit there happily until the apocalypse arrives, frozen foods require constant energy to stay frozen. But you can mitigate this energy consumption with better freezer management. Put your freezer near a direct heat source - it is often near the cooker - and you raise operating costs by around 50 per cent. Store it in the garage and keep it fully packed (it will work more efficiently) and it becomes relatively inexpensive. </p> <p>In either case, I'd rather have canned or frozen than the 'chilled' goods that increasingly stock our fridges, which are chilled throughout the supply chain and sold in open chiller cabinets competing to stay cool in heated shops. These are the products that should be given the cold shoulder.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:lucy.siegle@observer.co.uk\"><br>lucy.siegle@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>If belief is the big issue at Arsenal these days then a result like this nourishes the faithful. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger often likes to remind us that Arsenal get the wrong kind of kicks up north; victories are far harder to come by. The FA Cup, European Cup and 14 precious league points all went astray upland of Birmingham last season, but there was no northern exposure here.</p> <p>With Theo Walcott once more to the fore, Arsenal caressed their way through a defence as welcoming as the Blackburn weather, scoring twice before the break to convert the game's remainder to a training exercise. It culminated with Emmanuel Adebayor completing his hat-trick off the telling reverse pass of another young tyro, Aaron Ramsey. 'Very pleasing,' said Wenger. 'We started very late with our training because we had many players at the European Championship, but we are growing now.'</p> <p>Losing four goals for the second straight League match was down to 'suicidal defending', according to Paul Ince. 'I was tempted to bring myself on. Conceding eight goals in two games is not good - even though we are creating chances, we need to tighten up a bit.'</p> <p>With Samir Nasri injured on international duty and word swirling around that Tomas Rosicky's recovery from hamstring surgery had developed into a knee problem, Arsenal's team selection had been forced. The rest that Wenger had pondered granting Walcott evaporated as England's Croat killer was posted to the left wing.</p> <p>'Watch all our games now and see the first tackle on Theo,' warned Wenger after last Wednesday's heroics - if the intention was to intimidate the teenager's marker, it worked. Jay Simpson stood off his challenge the first two occasions Walcott came close; by the third, the right back and two team-mates were clutching air as Walcott created the opener.</p> <p>Breaking from that knot of markers, Walcott ran parallel with the 18-yard area, drew one more opponent towards him, then picked out Robin van Persie's run into the area. The Dutchman's first touch dragged Paul Robinson from his line and his second dragged the ball across him.</p> <p>Too much time prevented Arsenal from adding a second before the quarter-hour mark. A Blackburn corner degenerated into a three-on-one counterattack, with Walcott free on the left as Adebayor lolloped onwards. A simple pass set him up on his preferred right foot. The body shape was that of Thierry Henry bending the ball into the far corner. The end product was high, wide and ugly.</p> <p>Still more unsightly were the tackles Keith Andrews felt fit to inflict upon opponents in his first Premier League start. Straight from his former environment of League One, only Mike Dean's tolerance allowed the birthday boy to escape crude challenges on Van Persie and Cesc F\u00e1bregas without the yellow card each deserved.</p> <p>Consistently creative, Arsenal should again have extended their lead before a carousel of passes culminated with Adebayor's back-post header from a Denilson centre to make it 2-0.</p> <p>Until this point, there had been more to Blackburn than their scrappy defending, with enough chances created to have been on level terms. Roque Santa Cruz headed one Brett Emerton centre on to William Gallas's scalp, another wide and a third over. Emerton just failed to convert an Andrews cross; and the latter soon returned the favour. Santa Cruz miscued in front of Manuel Almunia, and when the goalkeeper was finally tested he proved equal to Brett Emerton's strike.</p> <p>Returned to the right to start the second half, Walcott soon skipped past Ryan Nelsen and into familiar penalty-area position. That Zagreb daisycutter, though, escaped him, allowing a man with less pleasant memories of Croatia to save.</p> <p>Arsenal were now in complete control, Wenger finally able to withdraw Walcott as his team comfortably shuffled possession between them. With 10 minutes remaining, Emmanuel Ebou\u00e9 won a penalty as Stephen Warnock left two legs to be tripped over at the cost of an injury that might keep Ebou\u00e9 out of Wednesday's Champions League tie. Adebayor converted emphatically, then took on Ramsey's fine pass to make it four. By then Wenger had added Jack Wilshere - at 16 years and 256 days, their youngest ever League footballer. 'I bring them out slowly, these English players,' smiled Wenger. 'He's another one who will soon play for you.'</p> <p><strong>THE FANS' PLAYER RATINGS AND VERDICT</strong></p> <p><strong>Paul McGarry, Observer reader</strong></p> <p>The game turned on their second goal. The first half had been fairly even - we had four or five excellent chances that we didn't take, they had two that they did. After that the second half was a non-event and like the previous game we let in two goals late on from poor defending. The result didn't really reflect the game, but it's exposed broader issues about how Ince has got us set up - we play a lot more openly than under Hughes, which can pay dividends, but the flipside is we look more vulnerable when we haven't got the ball. There are some positives, though - despite conceding four Robinson is doing OK, Reid is looking good in central midfield and Santa Cruz and Roberts caused Arsenal problems in the first half.<br><strong><br>The fan's player ratings</strong> Robinson 6; Simpson 6 (Derbyshire 5), Samba 5, Nelsen 6, Warnock 4; Emerton 6, Andrews 5, Reid 6, Pedersen 6 (Treacy 5); Santa Cruz 6, Roberts 6 (McCarthy 4)</p> <p><strong>Jeff Cronkshaw, Observer reader</strong></p> <p>An easy day, really. The first 20 minutes were fairly calm and we just got better and better. Adebayor's hat-trick was overdue and well deserved. His third in particular was fantastic. We weren't pressured at all and the penalty was just waiting to happen. Walcott oozed confidence - he's a different player now from the start of the season. His passing is much more fluent, more confident. I'm surprised he played here, to be honest, but I hope he gets a regular starting place now - we shall see in Kiev. We had some enjoyable banter at Paul Robinson's expense, too, calling him Tottenham's No 2.<br><strong><br>The fan's player ratings</strong> Almunia 7; Sagna 7, Tour\u00e9 8, Gallas 6, Clichy 8; Ebou\u00e9 6 (Ramsey n/a), F\u00e1bregas 8, Denilson 7, Walcott 9 (Song 8); Van Persie 7 (Wilshere n/a); Adebayor 9</p> <p><em><strong>To take part in the fans' verdict, email<br>fans@observer.co.uk</strong></em></p>",
  "<p>This is my last column, which is a shame: it means I won't have time to tell you anything about:</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The day I decided to take up swaggering. I've always wanted to swagger like young people and Liam Gallagher. The ability to waddle from left to right while simultaneously walking forward is a special mark of confidence I could make use of. Luckily, I found a leaflet advertising night classes in swaggering at my local community college. I went along. It was full of people my age. They were all very nice. I didn't reach the end of the course but I heard that one of the nice people who did went on to stab someone.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> My plans to do a TV version of The Archers. I thought I'd cracked it when I came up with the idea of making it more like Life On Mars. The storyline would be that one of the Archers would be hurt in a tractor accident, fall into a coma and wake up as a cow in the 70s.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The time I got worried about the sudden absence of filth at our local recycling centre. Usually, it was full to bursting; so much so that people began to complain about rubbish spilling out from the overfull bins and across into the children's playground. Then one day all the rubbish had gone. The area by the playground was spotless. The usual bins had disappeared. In its place was one small one. It looked empty. I peered into it. Near the bottom was a Black Hole. It was two centimetres thick and floating in mid-air. A sign outside the bin said: 'Empty your rubbish towards the Black Hole. Do not get too close.' I dropped in four empty milk containers. They quickly thinned out into a string of atoms and disappeared into the Black Hole. I jumped back, startled. A park caretaker nearby said: 'Don't worry. It'll be fine.' I looked down at my rubbish and most of it had gone. I looked up and the park caretaker was gone too. As was a bit of the park. I ran home. I found I was running a lot slower than I normally do.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The time I opened a restaurant and spent \u00a310,000 getting a branding consultancy to help me decide the name. They wanted something beguiling, like THE MAN WHO MISTOOK HIS WIFE FOR A STARTER, which I rejected, or THE WEDDING CURSE, which I nearly went with, but then rejected. I decided to call it THE BOY AND MACHETE. No one came. I sacked the branding firm, (whose name was BIG BRASS BRAND) and got in another one (called MARLYN BRAND-O). I gave them \u00a320,000 and they told me that my restaurant's name had to suggest exotic food with a feminine touch. They made me call the restaurant THE SIZZLED MAMMARY. Only one person came. He was a food inspector. He gave me a clean bill of health.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The day everyone panicked because the newspapers were reporting that bureaucrats in Brussels were planning to abolish floors.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The time crying became infectious. No one knows how it happened, but the sound of crying had mutated aurally so that it stimulated similar responses from the brains and vocal chords of people within five miles. At one point, 20 per cent of the population were constantly crying. Huw Edwards cried nightly on the News, even when just handing over to Robert Peston. The sound coming from Peterborough was unbearable. Steeplechasing was cancelled because it was too dangerous for jockeys to ride with tears in their eyes. Horses cried too, which didn't help. Bouncers outside night clubs suddenly found themselves looking ineffectual, and there was a collapse in the bouncing industry. Meantime, genuinely depressed people got quite annoyed.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The day I went to Ikea and saw a sign above an item of furniture saying: 'This would make a great deathbed.' I bought it, but never sleep in it.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The day the security services announced they would be combating terrorism by stopping it from being terrifying. Using intense electronic surveillance techniques, they pick up a signal of a terrorist in the act of recording his suicide video. Combat teams then burst in and cover him in custard pies. The video is put up on YouTube.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The day I came up with the idea that global warming could be stopped by getting every government in the world to invest in an enormous air conditioning unit that would float in space. The unit would suck all the warm air out of the atmosphere and blow it at Jupiter.</p> <p>It would require an enormous amount of electricity, which would contribute to global warming, but that would be negated by the fact the air conditioner would cool everyone down.</p> <p>The only problem would be that, if it ever broke, we'd discover that the Earth's natural temperature had gone up by 30C. However, I was assured by all the manufacturers that their air conditioning units were reliable, so this was bound not to happen.</p> <p>I did foresee one problem, which was that in about 300 years' time we would have to address the question of increased solar system warming.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The time the government announced it was bringing back the medieval code of chivalry.</p> <p>All young people had to promise to show largesse to everyone and destroy evil in all its monstrous forms. Young male school leavers had to pledge allegiance to a maiden.</p> <p>Not to be out-flanked the Opposition announced that, if elected, it would bring back duelling.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> And the day it rained Pepsi.</p>",
  "<p>Kate Rothko Prizel is a strong-looking woman with a disarming smile that she switches on and off like a flashlight. You sit opposite her, trying not to be distracted by the subliminal hum of the canvases on the walls - three early Rothkos to the right of me, and one to the left - and you wonder: how did she do it? How did she survive? Not that she even seems to know herself. 'I always tell people that 19 was the worst year of my life,' she says, with steady understatement. 'And everything has gone uphill from there.' </p> <p>The smile is duly turned on, and we gaze at one another for a moment. I can't make up my mind whether she is warning me off, or welcoming me in. Kate Rothko turned 19 almost four decades ago, in 1970; in some ways, the events we are about to discuss must feel as though they happened to another person, the facts both gilded and blurred by the weight of years. Then again, they are so starkly awful, it feels almost murderous to bring them up. What defences might I end up knocking down? It's hardly surprising that when she was younger and at medical school, Rothko would find herself categorically denying her relationship to that Rothko, or that later, when she married, she cloaked herself in her married name, Prizel, the better to be invisible.</p> <p>In 1970, on the cold morning of 25 February, the body of her father, the painter, Mark Rothko, was found in his cavernous Manhattan studio. He had overdosed on barbiturates, and cut an artery in his right arm with a razor blade. He was found in a pool of blood six by eight feet wide, wearing long johns and thick black socks. He left no note. He was 66. </p> <p>Six months later, on 26 August, Kate suffered another bereavement, less public, but just as bitter: at the age of 48, her mother, Mell, a book illustrator and Rothko's second wife, had dropped down dead as Kate's brother, Christopher, watched cartoons in the next room. The cause of death listed on her death certificate was 'hypertension due to cardiovascular disease'; however, like her estranged husband, she was a heavy drinker. </p> <p>Kate and Christopher, who was then just six years old, were now orphans (or The Orphans, as the art critic Robert Hughes referred to them some years later). But however terrible their grief, it seemed as if they would surely survive. It wasn't only that they would be OK financially; by 1970, Rothko's work was already achieving tremendous prices. It was more that Kate had always thought that 'the New York art world was the most idyllic place in which any child could grow up'; though their Rothko relatives were mostly out west and, to a degree, an unknown quantity, her father had been, in spite of his final catastrophic depression, a gregarious man, and a revered one. The family was nothing if not blessed with a multitude of friends.</p> <p>Or was it? It was the difference between the two funerals of her parents that revealed to Kate, even in the depths of her grief, that this might not, after all, be so. Perhaps the art world was not the bohemian extended family of her imagination. The two services took place in the same Manhattan funeral parlour, but they could not have been more different. After Mark's funeral, one art world viper is reputed to have remarked that it was 'the best vernissage of the season', and it is certainly true that it was well attended by the great and the good. Among the mourners were Willem de Kooning, Robert Motherwell, Philip Guston and Lee Krasner Pollock, not to mention the rows of critics, curators, and collectors. 'At my father's funeral, people were pouring out of the woodwork,' says Kate. 'But I would have to question why they were there, because only about 10 people came to my mother's. She'd known these people for 25 years, and now it was like she was... ' A footnote? 'Yes. It was disillusioning for me to see the superficiality of the art world, and that has never gone away, I must admit. It will never be that idyllic place for me again.' </p> <p>Unfortunately, there was worse to come. Within two years, Kate and her brother were fighting a legal battle of Bleak House proportions that few thought they could win - and her parents' 'friends', by now, were even thinner on the ground. 'They were waiting to see which way it was going to go. People were hesitant to talk to me. Only a few were willing to stick their necks out. Lee Krasner, for one, gave multiple interviews in which she said how unwise I was to be fighting the case.'</p> <p>Kate and Christopher sued the executors of their father's estate - his accountant, Bernard Reis, the painter Theodoros Stamos, and a professor of anthropology called Morton Levine (Levine was also, until Kate took steps to remedy the situation, Christopher's guardian) - and his gallery, the Marlborough, claiming that the former had conspired with the latter to 'waste the assets' of Rothko's estate and defraud them of their proper share. The assets were 798 paintings (then estimated to be worth at least $32m). They contended that the three trustees had conspired to sell these Rothkos to the Marlborough at less than their true market value; the gallery had, for instance, got its delighted hands on one group of 100 paintings for just $1.8m, a sum it would pay over 12 years and with no interest, with a down-payment of only $200,000. </p> <p>The case was to rumble on for more than four years, during which Kate was mostly living in a $90-a-week apartment in Brooklyn, watching what little money she had drain out of her bank account. It was to be seven long years before she had a Rothko of her own; if she wanted to see work by her father, her only option was to visit a gallery. How did she keep going? 'I don't know whether it was that I didn't allow myself to think of the possibility of losing, or whether it simply didn't cross my mind. I only know that I was convinced from a moral standpoint, and that I had a conviction that this was what I had to do, because I knew how upset my father would have been by what was going on.'</p> <p>To everyone's amazement, Kate and Christopher Rothko won, and the court issued a crushing verdict. The executors were thrown out for 'improvidence and waste verging on gross negligence'. Reis and Stamos, long-time friends of Mark Rothko, were found to have been in conflict of interest; as executors, they could not negotiate with the Marlborough because the company had both of them on its payroll. All contracts between the Marlborough and the Rothko estate were declared void, and the judge awarded damages of more than $9m against Frank Lloyd, the founder of Marlborough Fine Art, who had laundered art through myriad Liechtenstein holding companies, and the executors. </p> <p>Lee Krasner, swiftly eating her words, removed the estate of her husband, Jackson Pollock, from Marlborough's grasp, and others followed (though Marlborough Fine Art survives, even today). It was, Kate concedes, a magnificent victory - though Reis and Lloyd were, in spite of her best efforts, never punished in a criminal court for their actions. 'No, that's true. One had to make do with the satisfaction of seeing the paintings come back. The judge sat down with me several times [during the litigation] and asked me if I would make a settlement for money. But I always said no, because it wasn't about money.' Nor was it about ownership, or not in the private sense. Kate simply wanted to make sure that her father's wishes became a reality. </p> <p>Rothko may have been depressed at the end of his life, he may not have been as clear as he should have been when it came to writing a will; but with regard to his work, and where it might end up, he had long held strong views. While selling to private individuals from his studio, he would scrutinise their reactions to paintings; they had to pass a test they did not know they were taking. If they failed, they went home empty-handed, irrespective of the size of their wallets. Lighting, on which wall of a gallery a painting might hang; these things obsessed him. </p> <p>It was Marlborough's job to sell his work outside America, but so far as his legacy went, it was his wish that it should be seen by the public, and that groups of his paintings should stay together, like siblings. This was why, in the months before he died, he fell upon the idea of a Mark Rothko Foundation; this body, led by Reis, Stamos and Levine, would distribute his work to public galleries. The idea that individual works would disappear into the homes of millionaires was anathema to him.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the court did not rule on paintings that the Marlborough Gallery had already sold. 'We won, but so many didn't come back,' says Kate. 'We were too busy defending the judgment on appeal to go back and appeal for a better judgment. What I've found hardest over the years is looking at what didn't come back. It has been very... distressing. The most painful example I can give you is Homage to Matisse from 1954. It's the one painting I would really like to have; I grew up with it. I gather that it went into a vault somewhere for a number of years and then it came up for auction.' </p> <p>In 2005, the painting was sold by Christie's New York for $22.4m, a sum that was then a record for a postwar work. 'If something was offered to us in a non-auction situation, I suppose we might make a trade. But at auction, at these prices... no. It's impossible. I finally found out who owns it, and it's another collector, one who will probably never let it out of his private home.' </p> <p>Do collectors ever invite her to come and see the paintings in their homes? 'Rarely.' Nor are they inclined to make loans. 'I have written for loans on behalf of institutions, to give an extra nudge, but they are invariably refused. Ostensibly, it's because they love the painting so much. But one has to wonder: does price come into it? They are scared of damage, which is always a possibility. I can only say that when the first major retrospective took place in 1978, it was no problem to get loans; now it is increasingly difficult. I find it horrible that art is just another investment.' She laughs. 'No, I don't get invited into too many homes, and perhaps it's just as well because I would probably be very unhappy with the vase on the table in front of the painting.'</p> <p>Kate Rothko Prizel M D (she is a research pathologist) lives with her husband, an academic, and her youngest daughter in a big (but not vast) Colonial-style house in Washington. I'm sure, given what hangs on her walls, she has a good security system, but if so, it is unobtrusive; I've seen tiny terraces more fortified, and most of those probably contain only the odd David Hockney poster. What you notice immediately are not just the paintings, but the gaps: work, she tells me half-apologetically, is often on loan and, sometimes, when it comes back, the business of rehanging such large and fragile canvases gets put off - and off. </p> <p>I ask her how many paintings are still in the family. 'It's hard to put a number on things,' she says. 'We had to sell some things to pay legal fees. I can't say what we will have for ever. Christopher and I each have three children. It's clear to me that they care about the paintings, and would rather have them than cash. But there will be estate taxes one day, and here, giving to a museum does not credit towards your estate tax.'</p> <p>In the 1970s, it was Kate who was 'the point person' when galleries were putting together shows of her father's work, but these days that task falls mostly to Christopher, a psychologist who now works almost exclusively in the interests of the Rothko estate. Even so, Kate will be coming to London for the opening of Tate Modern's Rothko show, the first significant exhibition of his work to be held in Britain for more than 20 years. She is thrilled by the idea of this exhibition in particular because it is not a retrospective, but a unique gathering of Rothko's late work, including the Seagram Murals, originally commissioned to hang in the dining room of the Four Seasons Restaurant in New York, and several other series, including the very last he ever painted, known as Black on Grey. </p> <p>'Seeing these paintings standing alone may have a very different effect on the audience,' she says. 'This time, there will be no side-by-side comparisons with the bright works of the 1950s, and [thus] the audience will not have a tendency to see the darkening colours as representing a change in his mood. With retrospectives, there is often a feeling [as you approach the monochromatic late works] that this was the ultimate walk towards his suicide. But look at them in isolation, and instead you simply feel something opening up before him. I do not connect any feeling of frustration in him at this time with a frustration over where his work was going. I see these paintings as a new beginning for him rather than a reflection of his mood. </p> <p>'No one would deny that my father was very depressed towards the end of his life. I used to be very engrossed with that idea, too. There was a terrible tendency for me to see the paintings darkening, becoming less accessible emotionally, more hard-edged. I had a hard time separating them from his depression. But then I saw an exhibition at the Menil Collection in Houston, work that followed his completion of the paintings for the Rothko Chapel [commissioned by Dominique and Jean de Menil in the mid-1960s]. I hadn't been familiar with those works. It was a period when I wasn't in the studio a lot, and my father didn't have any at home. It was fascinating to see how those works had grown out of the chapel, and then how they led to the black and greys. That was the beginning of a whole new way of seeing for me.'</p> <p>When Rothko committed suicide, many of his friends thought it out of character. As the painter Hedda Sterne put it: 'Who was this man, Rothko, who killed my friend?' Was Kate surprised? 'I guess it was a shock. In one sense, it fit. I knew how depressed he was. But it still seemed so out of character - and then, he did not leave a note, which seemed even more out of character. He was a communicator, on paper and verbally. That seemed extremely strange. He'd been very ill [in 1968, Rothko had suffered an aneurysm, a result of his chronic high blood pressure]. When my mother told me what had happened on the phone, she did not tell me he had killed himself, and I presumed his death was due to one of the illnesses. So I was shocked.' </p> <p>What was her father like? 'Oh, this is always a difficult one! He was a very social person, very outgoing.' In biographies, Rothko, who was born in Dvinsk, in what is now Latvia, and who arrived on Ellis Island, New York, in 1913, is always portrayed as a determined socialist. That is why he disapproved of the Four Seasons restaurant, and why he eventually decided to keep the paintings he made for its walls and later to give them to the Tate. </p> <p>He also liked to make jokes about his peasant background. 'Well, part of that was just his humour. He liked to tell stories about his past. He was anything but a peasant. Education in the family went back three generations. He did remain close to his background. His family was never particularly supportive of his career, and didn't understand it, but there was always a weekly phonecall. He was pretty representative of immigrants of the time, in that he didn't retain his own language - I didn't even learn how to say yes or no in either Yiddish or Russian - but he would always go to the atlas and show me Latvia. He was a great storyteller. He used to tell me that he ice-skated to school. Knowing his athletic abilities, I suspect that was one thing he did not do.'</p> <p>Kate was interested in his work from early on. Her parents had received membership of the Museum of Modern Art as a baby-shower gift and, on Sundays - after Mell insisted that Rothko leave his studio for the day - the family would go there. Later, Kate remembers visiting Peggy Guggenheim, the great patron and collector, in Venice. 'She took us to Torcello in her motorboat. But the story I always tell is about how, when I was 16, I went cross-country with my father by train. His family lived on the West Coast, and my mother would fly with my brother because he was so young. What is so frustrating, looking back, is that I had three days with my father and, had I been three years older, I would have taken the opportunity to talk to him about his philosophy. But, of course, we both sat there, and for three days, neither one of us really knew what to say to the other. It was an awkward age for me, and I think he felt that awkwardness. I look back and I think: what wasted time!'</p> <p>Rothko's philosophy was, of course, complicated. He belonged to a generation of artists - his contemporaries included Pollock, Barnett Newman and Clyfford Still - who spent long periods in obscurity and poverty before they were discovered by the critics, at which point their prices rose - and rose. Perhaps this was why, post-1960, he found it so hard to accept his wealth. He paid cash for everything and, according to Robert Motherwell, if he had to go to the bank for any reason, he would slip into 'a depression as intense and prolonged as Kafka writing The Castle'. </p> <p>But it was also that he worried that money would distract from the work itself; he distrusted material success. He was, as Robert Hughes has written, 'one of the last artists in America to believe, with his entire being, that painting could carry the load of major meanings and possess the same comprehensive seriousness as the art of fresco in the 16th century or the novel in 19th-century Russia... his painting accumulated resonance by appealing to myth; but myths were in decline....' </p> <p>He was determined to think of himself as an outsider even as the riches and the praise - contemporary critics adored Rothko to the point of daffiness - heaped up at his studio door. Did these tensions - the sense you get from his work of a man waiting too long for an epiphany - contribute to his final depression, or was it also, as Lee Seldes suggests in her gripping book about the Rothko trial, that the artist knew that he had signed over too much to the Marlborough? His suicide took place on the same day that a representative from the gallery was due to visit Rothko's warehouse, to choose from the artist's hoard of paintings, something no one had ever done before (he liked to choose paintings for sale himself, and saw this visit, which he felt powerless to resist, as an invasion of privacy). </p> <p>Kate is in two minds. 'I felt it had never quite sunk in how famous he had become,' she says. 'But then, when Pop art and Op art came so hard on their heels [of the Abstract Expressionists], he felt that he had had only a tiny window of fame, and then what? I think he would have been shocked by what happened after he died because he was absolutely convinced the executors were his friends, and that they'd act in the best interests of the estate. Whether he knew what was going on with the gallery is less clear. He knew he was not... free. I suspect things were planned for a while before he died. It seemed like everything was in place. I can't say if those pressures contributed to his mood, but they would certainly seem to have helped.'</p> <p>Whatever lay behind her father's final destructive act, Kate hopes that Tate Modern's show will go some way to separating the work from the man, the paint from the biography. She would like people to see the late work as just that - late work - and to relish it for its own sake, the way we might the distinctive late bloom of any other artist, rather than regard it as a symptom of the dark clouds overhead. 'Even I have to step back from the biography at times,' she says. 'From my father as I knew him. Because, sometimes, that leads to misinterpretation.' </p> <p>For me, the late paintings stand, as much as anything, as a corrective to the earlier work, with its warming yellows and pinks. They remind you that what Rothko most feared and disdained - the idea that his work was regarded as decorative - is too narrow, or at least too easy, a way of seeing him. They are the apotheosis of the existential struggle that lies at the heart of all his work. </p> <p>And does his daughter still miss the man who gave us the paintings it has been her privilege to fight for, and to protect? I guess, thanks to his work, that her father lives on in a way that most people's parents do not. 'Yes. He does live on in that way. But the paintings are only one part of my father, and not the purely dad part. At family events, I still find myself thinking: I wish he could be here - though not, 38 years on, with the same tearfulness that I felt for... well, the first 20 years.'</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Rothko is at Tate Modern 26 Sep-1 Feb 2009. <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/tickets\">tate.org.uk/tickets</a></p> <h2>Rothko's life in brief</h2> <p><strong>1903 </strong>Marcus Rothkowitz is born in Latvia.

  "<p>In 2003, the same year that he unveiled 'The Weather Project', his now legendary giant artificial sun that lit up the Turbine Hall at Tate Modern, Olafur Eliasson also created a much more intimately dramatic work of art. In a makeshift gallery at the Venice Biennale, he installed a white plastic drum that protruded from a wall with a red button on it that said 'PRESS'. Anyone who was brave or curious enough to press the button was startled seconds later by an intense flash of light from within the drum. For several minutes afterwards, each time the viewer blinked, the word 'UTOPIA' was imprinted on their retina. It was a work of art that literally made you see the world differently, and, as such, was both an illustration of and a metaphor for the Icelandic-born artist's methodology. Perhaps more than any other artist working today, Eliasson involves the viewer directly in the artworks he creates. 'My work is not about me,' he once said, 'it's about you.' </p> <p>'The Weather Project' was the most successful single work of contemporary art exhibited in Britain in recent years, attracting an astonishing two million viewers to Tate Modern. More interesting still was the way in which the audience interacted with the piece. Many visitors wandered slowly through the Turbine Hall as if determined to take it all in, while others lounged on the floor for hours like sunbathers. Some days the atmosphere turned celebratory as crowds of strangers interacted by arranging their bodies to spell out giant words that were reflected on the mirrored ceiling. When Tim Neuger, Eliasson's gallerist in Berlin, visited Tate Modern, a group of young people had spelt out the words 'Fuck Bush' on the ceiling. He rang Eliasson in Berlin and let him listen to the cheers of the crowd echoing though the Turbine Hall. </p> <p>You could say that Eliasson has reinvented the way in which conceptual art is received by the public, replacing the usual hushed reverence - or sighs of exasperation - with a mood of playful and anarchic mischief. 'I do not see my work as any kind of statement or a manifesto,' he says. 'It's a dialogue. Always.'</p> <p>Right now, that dialogue is continuing apace, and with equally dramatic results, in New York, where Eliasson has created a series of giant self-propelling waterfalls on the East River. Situated at four different points between Manhattan and Brooklyn, the '<a href=\"http://www.nycwaterfalls.org/#/about_the_waterfalls/Waterfall_Images\">New York City Waterfalls</a>' range in height from 90ft to 120ft, each pumping up to 35,000 gallons of water a minute up and over their giant frames. At night, they are illuminated, adding another level of surrealism to an otherwise drab stretch of the river. Eliasson's art attempts to make us see the everyday in a different light. 'In a way,' says Eliasson, 'I like to think that I have given New Yorkers back their river.'</p> <p>And they, in their turn, have responded in kind. On the online photograph site, Flickr, visitors have posted more than 5,000 snapshots of the waterfalls, a mass response that pleases Eliasson much more than the chorus of excited approval that greeted the project's unveiling in the American media. 'On Flickr, the photographs have been taken mainly on mobile phones, and often there are people in the photographs with the waterfalls,' he says. 'It's a highly subjective way of documenting the work. I see the waterfalls as a co-producer of the time and place in which they take place. I suppose, in that way, the work filters into questions about society and democracy.'</p> <p>This may indeed be the case, but it strikes me later, while perusing the images on Flickr, that the 'New York City Waterfalls' may also function as a kind of temporary tourist attraction that visitors pose in front of in much the same way that they pose in front of the iconic skyline or the Statue of Liberty further out in the harbour. In this way, Eliasson's artwork may well have slipped, like artworks have a tendency to do, out of the artist's control. </p> <p>And for Olafur Eliasson, art does seem in a very real way to be about control. He frets a lot about how his work is interpreted to the point where he often tries to undercut the media's tendency to report what he does as mere spectacle. Or, as he puts it, 'I have a team that includes lawyers, copyright specialists, press officers, all making sure that the values I think the work represents are navigated into the communication of the project throughout the process. In my practice, I try my best to avoid the experience of my work being formalised, standardised, generalised and rationalised. My work is about the opposite.'</p> <p>For someone who makes epic works of such sublime beauty - in itself quite a feat in an age when notions of the sublime in art sometimes seem as pass\u00e9 as pastels and watercolours - Eliasson is a doggedly serious, even earnest, young man. Talking to him about his art can be oddly exhausting. His mind, as his ambitious projects suggest, is in constant motion, one thought spiralling into another in ever-evolving circles of conceptual complexity. Like many installation artists, he has a tendency to theorise and his speech is littered with terms like 'duality' and 'collectivity', not to mention 'experiential'. He is the contemporary artist-as-boffin as well as architect, designer, philosopher and scientist. </p> <p>'If one were to look for precedents as to the way Olafur works,' says Hans Ulrich Obrist of the Serpentine Gallery in London, where the artist created a pavilion last summer, 'it would have to be Buckminster Fuller, the artist-as-inventor. He has that kind of enquiring approach where the art emerges out of collective studio operation that is essentially a laboratory of ideas.'</p> <p>To this end, Eliasson currently employs around 40 people in his Berlin studio, including architects and scientists as well as craftsmen and designers. It's all very Scandinavian, the notion of the unified aesthetic taken to conceptual extremes in the pursuit of art that is so ambitious in both its form and content that it engages the audience almost as much as it has engaged the minds of its creators. Before he installed his giant sun in Tate Modern, Eliasson's team constructed a small-scale version of the Turbine Hall, about 40ft long, in his studio so that they could wander through it and observe the effects.</p> <p>'It's certainly unusual the way that he embraces all these various backgrounds to his art,' continues Julia Peyton-Jones, director of the Serpentine Gallery. 'Olafur's work addresses architecture, design, science and philosophy, and he operates at a very serious level. Of course, he has quite a big support team, but essentially it's his mind and his ideas that drive all these artistic investigations and makes his art what it is.'</p> <p>I meet Eliasson in Copenhagen, where he has a big, bright, airy harbour-side office near the docks. He lives in the Danish capital with his wife and two adopted children when he is not working in Berlin, or flying around the world to oversee the various high-concept art projects he seems to be juggling at any given time. (In 1998, he had more than 60 artworks on show across the world.) Both his adopted son and daughter are Ethiopian, and he and his wife, the art historian Marianne Krogh Jensen, run a charity for Ethiopian orphans called <a href=\"http://www.121Ethiopia.org\">121Ethiopia.org</a>. Recently, he designed a kind of mini art installation in the form of a light projection that will greet visitors to every Louis Vuitton shop on the planet - there are over 300. All the money earned from the commission went directly to his charity fund. </p> <p>Currently, Eliasson is involved in an ambitious urban renewal project in Manhattan called the High Line and, earlier this summer he had a big retrospective of his work at MoMA. Alongside the architects Diller Scofidio+Renfro, he will help transform a mile-and-a-half stretch of disused elevated railway track into an elongated shopping mall with a park. Or, as the DS+R website puts it, 'a post-industrial instrument of leisure reflection'. You can see why Olafur gets along with them. </p> <p>For the past two-and-a-half years, he has also been working on what he calls his 'academy'. The vast new office-cum-studio space he has just purchased in Berlin was formerly a school and, when it is converted, will house up to 20 student-apprentices who, Bauhaus-style, will learn how to be artists by being on-site and contributing to the Eliasson laboratory of ideas. </p> <p>'Though all this is not related directly to making art, it is exciting and therapeutic,' he says, sounding genuinely enthused by the challenge. 'When you move studio, you can also optimise the values of the workplace. I can now give more space to the things that have turned out to be important and shed the less interesting things. A studio is not just a workspace but a little psychographic universe of the brain.'</p> <p>At 40, Eliasson still has the air of the brainiest boy at school about him, and his chic wardrobe and designer spectacles somehow accentuate his palpable sense of studiousness. He was born in Denmark though both his parents are from Iceland, where his father worked as a cook on a fishing boat and a part-time artist, and his mother as a dressmaker. Interestingly, both his grandparents were bohemians: his grandfather published avant-garde writing, while his grandmother was a photographer of some local repute, and hosted a salon where Reykjavik's scattered artistic community gathered to argue and swap ideas. 'I am not avant-garde at all,' says Eliasson. 'I do not want to be a spokesman or lead a movement. I am essentially a traditionalist.' </p> <p>Eliasson was four when his parents split up. A few years later, after his father moved back to Iceland, he began spending his summer holidays there with him. You sense that the country's elemental landscapes, strange sunlight and long shadows have had some deep and lasting effect on his creative psyche. As a teenager, he was a prolific drawer, specialising in anatomical sketches. By 14, he had also discovered breakdancing, which he seems to have embraced with the same fervour as he later pursued conceptual art. With his teenage posse, 'The Harlem Gun Crew', he toured Scandinavia, and even won the national break-dancing championship. Today, he is resolutely tight-lipped regarding his personal life, but recently he told the New Yorker that break-dancing 'really gave me a quite particular idea of space, and an obsession with how the body moves within that space'. </p> <p>The same article had also revealed that, in 1987, his grandfather had committed suicide and that, as part of his university application, Eliasson had submitted a piece of sculpture in the form of a black gravestone. </p> <p>He looks genuinely perturbed when I mention the New Yorker piece in passing. 'That was impossible for me. I mean, what was it about? And why on earth would anyone want to write a piece like that? The media do not know exactly how to verbalise something that does not anchor in the personal life of an artist. The music and fashion industry have promoted that idea for so long that it has become a model for how the media wants to address art.' He shrugs his shoulders and sighs. 'Also, I'm just not interesting enough to do that kind of profile on.'</p> <p>This is a refrain that echoes throughout our conversation, and suggests that the incredible success of 'The Weather Project' and the 'New York City Waterfalls' has brought in its wake a level of exposure that Eliasson is utterly uncomfortable with. Earlier, when the subject of the YBAs, and Tracey Emin in particular, had come up, he had said, 'Emin is the opposite of me. Merging her life and her artwork completely is her greatest success, but I do not have those social skills. I am much more mainstream and boring. I am an uninteresting person really. I try to let the work go out there and not to require me to be in front of it.'</p> <p>When I ask him who his formative influences were, he thinks for a moment, as if weighing up whether he should reveal them or not. Finally, he says, 'I started out being interested in the American west coast movement - Sol LeWitt, Donald Judd, Dan Flavin. Then, I came across the so-called land artists - Richard Long, Hamish Fulton.' </p> <p>Eliasson's willingness to make epic artworks in the open air, though, recalls the work of Christo, who, back in the Seventies and Eighties, famously wrapped huge public buildings in fabric. Initially, though, after graduating from the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, Eliasson expressed himself though photography: big Icelandic landscapes whose horizons and dimensions seemed askew. Soon, though, he moved into more ephemeral territory, using water, ice, steam and light in installations. In Venice, he also created the 'Yellow Room', which was lit by the kind of high-definition sodium lights that are used in Swiss motorway tunnels. He described, in his inimitable way, the experience of walking through it as 'hyper-seeing'. </p> <p>More dramatic still was his now legendary act of interventionist or guerrilla art, the 'Green River' project, which consisted of dyeing rivers in various cities bright green. Using industrial amounts of the same vegetable dye that Irish-American bars use to colour the beer on St Patrick's Day, Eliasson managed to change the colour - at least for a brief moment - of rivers in Tokyo, Los Angeles and Stockholm. The impulse, he says, was the same one that drove the Waterfalls project. 'It makes the water explicit. You see the river differently. It shows that the river is a bloody river and not a postcard.'</p> <p>Eliasson is quick to point out that, while the 'Green River' was 'an activist project', the 'New York City Waterfalls' is not. Does his work have an ecological agenda, as some have suggested? He sighs, but then concedes that this is an interesting question. </p> <p>'With \"The Weather Project\", I ask myself that question all the time. I did not anticipate the global warming issue as it is today, it was more an attempt to set up ideas that would constitute a platform for collectivity. But the weather has become politicised. So, interestingly, the world has changed and the reading of my work has changed with it, but the work itself hasn't changed.' </p> <p>He stares at my tape recorder for a long moment, as if lost in thought, then he says, 'One should be careful about only amplifying the ecological aspects of the waterfalls. I certainly don't consider myself an eco-warrior. Not at all. Talking about green power, that is for the brain. I'm not an intellectual artist, as you can see from my art. I make my work and then I talk about it. My work does not illustrate my ideas; my ideas try and support my work.' </p> <p>Nevertheless, this is a man who initially wanted the Turbine Hall in Tate Modern to accommodate a tropical rainstorm as well as a giant sun. For once, though, the mechanics could not support the idea. The 'New York City Waterfalls', it strikes me, may well be that idea transformed. Indeed, one could view Eliasson's entire output as one unified work-in-progress. </p> <p>'Olafur's process has to do with producing reality,' says Hans Ulrich Oberst, 'and that has taken him way beyond the exhibition space. He has an incredible sense of determination and a commitment to pursuing his ideas to see where they lead. With him, it's not so much about the destination but the journey itself.' </p> <p>Towards the end of our meeting, I ask Eliassson, who has grown visibly restless, if he ever finds the time to daydream or be bored? He looks momentarily startled. 'When I am bored, I start doubting whether I exist,' he replies, without irony. 'When I don't do anything, I feel I might disappear.' </p> <p>I ask him, in conclusion, if there might come a point when the bigness starts getting in the way of the art. 'Generally speaking, you are surely right,' he says, frowning and looking even more fretful, 'but one needs to challenge oneself and look deeper and ask oneself what role art has in society. To answer that question, one must take certain risks in order to reinvent what art can do. For me, the question is not how big or how small, but does the work succeed.'</p>",
  "<p>Annie Proulx has proved herself - with the unwieldy architecture of her novels Postcards and Accordion Crimes - to be something of a sucker for an over-ambitious structure. She's at it again here. She prefaces her third volume of Wyoming stories with a quote from John Clay's My Life on the Range: 'On the surface,' Clay observed of the American west, 'everything was lovely, but when you got into the inside circle you soon found out that the lines of demarcation were plainly marked.' This innocuous observation resonates for Proulx, you are led to understand as this book unfolds, because of that phrase 'inside circle'. There are nine stories here, each of them hellish in different ways; the dust bowl, having been so many things to Proulx already, is here made to stand for her inferno.</p> <p>She makes this more explicit than she needs to by interspersing her usual, surprising saddle-sore realism with two tales told by Satan - Stygian satires in which the Prince of Darkness, cast as an interior designer, dreams up new looks for eternal damnation. Leafing through the Guardian, and assisted by his secretary Duane Fork, the devil cooks up all kinds of torment: tsunamis, global warming and email havoc, in which he is happy to see the world upstairs conspires. Down below, this being Proulx, he has particular fun with old cowboys, Butch Cassidy and the rest, 'bowlegged men lollygagging near a boiling water hole' in Dis. He gets the Four Horsemen to ride them down, brand, rope and castrate them.</p> <p>These two stories are unnecessary for a couple of reasons: the silly ironies scupper the tone of what is otherwise another gutsy, exact collection of tales and, moreover, the cartoon torments of hell are nothing compared to the daily lives Proulx depicts elsewhere with such a clear eye. Leaving aside those embarrassing intruders, though, and concentrating on what Proulx does as well as anyone - simple human misery, with highly local understanding, and singular description, there are plenty of vintage stories here.</p> <p>She starts out, in 'Family Man', in that very real purgatory on earth, a western-themed retirement home, 'furniture upholstered in fabrics with geometric \"Indian\" designs, lampshades sporting buckskin fringe'. Ray Forkenbrock is a former horse-catcher and ranch-hand now spending his days looking at the high sierra in the distance. He has a family history to tell to his eager grand-daughter with her tape recorder, but the history is not the mythology of western frontiersmen she hopes to be able to pass on to her children; it is a much nastier story of a father with four families in different corners of the state, and of half-forgotten sex crimes. In his eighties Ray still can't handle it all, and neither can his granddaughter 'You'd think there would have been closure by now,' she observes.</p> <p>But this is Wyoming, and there never is: 'Everything you ever did or said kept pace with you right to the end.' This sense of a regional family, inbred and in denial, mostly silent about its past and its desires, is what makes Proulx's state such an uncomfortable place to be. It's what gave the authentic charge of transgression and pathos to Brokeback Mountain. The opening of 'Them Old Cowboy Songs' makes all that plain: 'There is a belief that pioneers came into the country, homesteaded, lived tough, raised a shoeless brood and founded ranch dynasties. Some did. But many more had short runs and were quickly forgotten.'</p> <p>Archie and Rose are two of the latter, making a home in 1885 on an unlikely parcel of land in the Sierra Madre. 'There is no happiness,' Proulx writes, 'like that of a young couple in a little house they have built themselves in a place of beauty and solitude.' Few American writers are as good as evoking that idea as she is, and hardly any can watch it all unspool with quite her sense of timing. Proulx is like Hawthorne in that respect: innocence never persists more than a paragraph, hope never makes it through a story. Not long after Rose discovers she is expecting their baby, Archie takes a job as a cowboy upstate, for a year. But the job goes bad, and so does the baby, and so does Rose, and soon enough the little home is broken up by a couple of winters and returned to scrub.</p> <p>That fate is seen to persist to the present, and there's not much escape. The last story here is also the best, not least for its title, which might describe the collection as a whole: 'Tits-up in a Ditch'. Dakotah believes she can get away from the life she's been given by joining up, going to Iraq; she finds love there for a while with fellow female recruit, Marnie - a self-conscious counterpoint to Brokeback Mountain. But she has to come back of course, and home is every bit as much a war zone as where she has been; returning to familiar roads 'she realised that every ranch she passed had lost a boy, lost them early and late, boys smiling, sure in their risks, healthy, tipped out of the current of life by liquor and acceleration, rodeo smashups, bad horses, deep irrigation ditches, tractor rollovers and \"unloaded\" guns ... ' This is the territory Proulx stakes out for herself. Who needs hell when you have Wyoming?</p>",
  "<p><strong>The dilemma</strong> I broke up with a girlfriend of four years a few months back because she was without doubt the most jealous woman I have ever met, and it was getting worse. (Although I never told her this, to spare her feelings - she is quite sensitive underneath the tough exterior.) She seems to have not let go and continues to tell everyone we are still together and are only taking time out. Things took on a darker note a week ago when I went for lunch with a colleague of mine and afterwards she told me that she had received several threatening phone calls from a woman. I'm fairly sure it was my ex. Tell me what to do: am I being paranoid or overreacting, because I'm afraid of this escalating</p> <p><strong>Mariella</strong> You clearly need to have a full and frank discussion with your ex, but humour me a little first. Let's talk about one of the most corrosive emotions to afflict any relationship, as you discovered - jealousy. Whether it's justified or imagined, the green-eyed monster is a very scary beast indeed. I've seen it cow perfect relationships into submission and destroy a few of my own along the way. </p> <p>Like acne, jealousy is most frequently found and certainly only acceptable in youth, though it's all but guaranteed to exist at terrifying levels not only in adolescent but early adult relationships, too. There can be few of us who emerged from our twenties without at some time or other succumbing to the insidious, debilitating and incredibly destructive effects of imagined, potential or, worst of all, proven infidelities. Happily, the latter tends to be the least likely scenario of the three. </p> <p>When you're caught in its steely grip, jealousy seems the perfectly rational side-effect of true passion. You're in love, which is a risky business, and therefore you must protect your territory as though it were the last oil field on earth. There are many things wrong with that theory - not least the notion that love is something you can claim possession of and then keep hold of by ring fencing it from any other potential takers. Nobody ever stuck around solely because you managed to eradicate all temptation. The most accomplished control freak in the universe couldn't protect a relationship for an entire lifetime. If anything, the partnerships who enjoy long-term success tend to be those where the connecting fibres are surprisingly lax. I'm not talking about that flawed utopian ideal of the open relationship, rather that when two adults allow expectations of decency and respect to dictate their behaviour (rather than their psychotic subconscious), things tend to go more smoothly. </p> <p>If you're unfortunate enough to end up with a strayer, there is no security system on earth that will keep them faithful - and only heartbreak ahead for the partner who makes it their life mission to cling on. With that in mind there is nothing less dignified than an adult man or woman displaying the symptoms of irrational jealousy. If you're so afraid your partner is going to stray that you need to scare off any adult who appeals, then there is either something very wrong with you or with your relationship. Maturity leads most rational adults to the conclusion that jealousy is not an indication of the depth of feeling involved or an emotion to be coveted. Rather it's as clear an indication that things are awry as incessant arguing or a complete absence of physical contact. </p> <p>For the sake of one's pride alone, jealousy is worth eradicating from the equation. To spend the little time you have consumed by the terrible dread that you are about to lose everything you love in ghastly circumstances is no way to lead a fulfilling life. </p> <p>The jealousy sufferer is always on the wrong foot, too. Either they are imagining infidelities where none exists - which makes them the weaker partner, vulnerable and ultimately en route to destroying their relationship - or their fear is based on real betrayal, and equally unhelpful. Jealousy doesn't make you strong, angry or better able to deal with a cheating partner; it makes you insecure, bitter and stressed. </p> <p>So to you and your potential bunny-boiling ex. I'm unclear why you spared her feelings when you broke up: most people would far rather be given a tangible cause for being chucked than the banal 'It's not working'. You need to tell her, in no uncertain terms, that her jealousy poisoned your relationship and will ruin her life until she gets a grip. Clearly you also need to make plain that you have moved on and that you hope she has, too. You may never know if she was the deranged caller, but you can make sure you're not to blame for sending her confusing messages. If she's brandishing a zealot's confidence that you are hers to lay claim to, you need to make very plain <br>that you are an independent state and will not be walled off like some unfortunate human manifestation of the West Bank.</p> <p><strong>If you, too, have a dilemma, send a brief email to mariella.frostrup@observer.co.uk</strong></p>",
  "<p>The survival of Lehman Brothers, Wall Street's fourth largest investment bank, hangs in the balance this weekend as the US Treasury and Federal Reserve Bank frantically try to organise a rescue bid from a consortium, spearheaded by Bank of America.</p> <p>The consortium is also being backed by the China Investment Company and financial turnaround specialist JC Flowers. Barclays could also become involved in the consortium's plan for a break-up bid. Alternatively, the US authorities may persuade the consortium to provide a temporary shelter for Lehman, prior to a fire sale of its assets and mass layoffs.</p> <p>Either way, a huge proportion of the bank's 26,000-strong global workforce are expected to lose their jobs, including several thousand in London.</p> <p>The situation is complicated because US Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson has indicated that the authorities are not prepared to bail out Lehman with taxpayers' money in the way it did with mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac last week. Nor are they prepared to furnish financial guarantees of the kind that helped to facilitate the sale of Bear Stearns to JP Morgan earlier this year.</p> <p>Banking sources say it is not impossible that Lehman will go under, or be put into a form of temporary bankruptcy. </p> <p>Without a rescue deal that can be unveiled to the market tomorrow, Lehman's share price could fall further. It has lost three-quarters of its value in four days and has fallen 97 per cent in the past year.

  "<p>Covent Garden's opulent Royal Opera House was an unusual place for Charles Allen, then head of ITV, to meet another working-class son of Lanarkshire. The glitzy party held three years ago was to celebrate the 50th anniversary of ITV. Celebrities, journalists and actors swigged champagne as they mingled inside the opera house's spectacular glass-panelled Floral Hall. Veteran newsreader Jon Snow struggled to be heard above the hubbub as he attempted to host a live spoof news quiz between two teams of ITN journalists past and present. </p> <p>So when Allen, a former accountant and son of a barber and waitress, shook hands with the Labour politician and his contemporary John Reid, it must have been reassuring to find a kindred spirit. One former adviser to Allen recalls: 'Charles was always a bit of an outsider in media circles. He tried quite hard to fit in but was sneered at. It was a source of frustration that he was seen as a bean counter. He was the slightly portly Scotsman who was never quite part of mainstream luvviedom.' Indeed, British actor John Cleese once famously dismissed Allen, who started out in the catering business, as an 'upstart caterer'. A year after the Royal Opera House party, the luvvies - and disgruntled ITV shareholders - got their wish and Allen was replaced with the flamboyant, cigar-chomping former BBC director-general Michael Grade.</p> <p>So Allen could afford himself a wry smile last week. He has been appointed non-executive director of rival Virgin Media, which tried to buy ITV until it was thwarted by Sky. It also emerged that he has become an adviser to the private equity arm of investment bank Goldman Sachs, another failed bidder for ITV. The investment bank also owns television production company Endemol, maker of Big Brother, where Allen also becomes non-executive director. </p> <p>This TV comeback, two years after being unceremoniously dumped, has set media tongues wagging: could he be plotting a revenge raid on ITV?</p> <p>Allen is known for being extremely thick-skinned, a born survivor. The youngest of three children, he says he was a 'mistake', born when his mother was 40 and his siblings were teenagers. When he was just 14, his father, a hairdresser, died of a heart attack, which the fiercely private Allen calls a 'very significant' moment in his life. His mother went to work in the dining rooms of British Steel, which is where she saw an ad for a trainee accountant. Allen took the job, turning down the offer of a place at Strathclyde University. Allen says he has always been conscious of not completing his studies. 'I felt inferior about not going to university,' he once said in an interview. 'For many years when asked I would say that I was educated in Scotland. I'd duck the question as I felt so uncomfortable.'</p> <p>Not that his humble origins held him back. He left British Steel to work for drinks business Grand Met, which is where he met the man he calls his mentor, former Rentokil boss Sir Gerry Robinson. The pair took over Granada, then a media and catering conglomerate, with Allen taking charge of Granada Television, which went on to merge with Carlton to form ITV (as a plc) in 2004. </p> <p>But it was by no means plain sailing. Allen and his counterpart at Carlton, Michael Green, managed to waste more than \u00a31bn on ITV Digital, their doomed attempt to take on BSkyB. Shareholders led by Fidelity fund manager Anthony Bolton (nicknamed the 'quiet assassin') demanded blood, and Green was ousted. Although Allen survived the coup, he remained tainted with his involvement in the expensive digital failure. </p> <p>The long-awaited merger in many ways should have been the defining moment in Allen's career in television. But he took the helm of the new company still smarting from shareholder criticism and trying to stem the inexorable downward tide in ITV's ratings in the new multi-channel world. ITV, which for so long had enjoyed a monopoly position with advertisers, now faced the twin threat of a resurgent Sky and the runaway success of Freeview. Allen launched the new digital channels, ITV2, ITV3 and ITV4, to try to claim a bigger share of the digital pie, but he was fighting a losing battle. Sir Gerry Robinson tells The Observer: 'Charles was always a first-class operator. But if you pick up running a TV operation at the point where advertising is going off a cliff, it's unlikely you can arrest this. And advertising did fall off a cliff.'</p> <p>Possibly Allen's biggest mistake was buying networking website Friends Reunited for \u00a3120m in 2005. The idea was to share content between the website and ITV's channels, and to build up a database of online subscribers. But bankers and analysts were left flummoxed by the deal. Even ITV's attempts to explain it seemed confused. </p> <p>One former senior Granada executive recalls that Allen was not an early advocate of the internet. While the BBC - admittedly with a much larger budget - established its website as one of the world's best, Allen underestimated the impact it would have in the media world, the executive says. Even by the mid-Nineties, Allen, who is dyslexic, did not have a computer on his desk, refusing to use email. He also objected to the introduction of email across the group. 'He thought it was a waste of money.' Buying Friends Reunited for such a large sum might have been Allen's misguided way of catching up. </p> <p>Like others from the industry, the executive says he clashed with Allen's 'obsession' with cutting costs, rather than investing in programming. While Allen was a fine tactician, he adds, he did not fully grasp technical issues, like the patchy coverage for ITV Digital, and how this would hamper its attempt to compete with Sky. </p> <p>Yet, for all the fanfare that greeted the arrival of Grade to replace Allen in 2006, the broadcaster continues to struggle. Its share price has more than halved and the ratings decline continues, so maybe no magic bullet exists for ITV. And while much-vaunted programmes, such as reality TV show Survivor, flopped under Allen, he scored some notable successes: he successfully negotiated with the regulator to show fewer costly and minority-interest public service programmes, and made millions of pounds of savings out of the merger. A former adviser says: 'He was a great deal more successful than people realise.'</p> <p>Certainly his talents for restructuring departments, and his administrative flair, did not escape John Reid, the then Home Secretary. After he left ITV, Allen was brought in on a year-long secondment to shake up the Home Office, which Reid had labelled as 'not fit for purpose'. </p> <p>Sources close to Allen, who decline to be quoted, dismiss talk that last week's appointments are a prelude to a Virgin Media- or Goldman Sachs-led break-up bid for ITV. However, one former Virgin Media executive suspects that Allen would find the prospect tantalising. 'If he could take ITV private and stick his fingers up to the shareholders who got rid of him, he would only be human to enjoy it,' he says.</p> <p>But who would want to take on the enormous challenges faced by ITV, a legacy broadcaster in a multi-channel world with no platform of its own? There is also the small matter of BSkyB's 17 per cent blocking stake in the broadcaster. The government has ruled that most of this must be sold for competition reasons, but it is not clear when this will happen. </p> <p>Sir Gerry Robinson denies that his old friend is desperate for another tilt at ITV: 'He has moved on,' he says. Asked if Allen feels he has unfinished business with the broadcaster, he adds: 'I would have no sense of Charles having that feeling hanging over him.'</p> <h2>The CV</h2> <p><strong>Name</strong> Charles Allen<br><strong>Age</strong> 51<br><strong>Education</strong> Bellshill Academy, Lanarkshire; also a qualified accountant<br><strong>Career</strong> Joined British Steel as a trainee aged 17.

  "<p>Consider what ordinary, hard-working people do in recession - or, at least, what the media tell us they do. They cut back on waste. They eat all the food they buy (and get it from Lidl rather than Marks). They save heat by the pennyworth, turn out the lights, say farewell to fripperies. Pain, pain, pain. But look now and see what those same media prophets of doom are doing.</p> <p>Up in a rush goes the price of newspapers: the Times to 80p, the Telegraph to 90p - and, from tomorrow, the Independent to \u00a31. You may remember, from a couple of years ago, how Simon Kelner, then editor but now chief executive at the Independent, said that he thought daily papers ought to cost a pound - and Sundays \u00a32. Well, the Sunday Times took his advice, and famously came a cropper; but now his own baby is taking the Kelner test.</p> <p>Inside mediaworld, of course, such decisions run on familiar grooves. If advertising is falling off a cliff, then the only other source of revenue - cover price - has to be tapped. And if there is no cover price - because you're a free newspaper - then that may be very hard cheese. Trinity Mirror closed seven frees last week. But, at least, where there's a price, there's a way out.</p> <p>Except that it's not a particularly appetising way. Much of the gloom this autumn has wafted over from America like some remnant of Hurricane Hanna. The New York Times has put up its price twice in a year and sampled the bitter consequences. This week it's cutting out some of its sections and producing something thinner and smaller from Monday to Saturday. The size and range of what's offered to the reader is shrinking as well - and crudely geared to staff cuts.</p> <p>Some of those cuts can be very crude indeed. Richard Desmond of the Daily Express, a proprietor who might have played centre-back for Croatia in another life, has begun dumping another 80 journalists, many of them sub-editors. Yet the one thing you might expect from our founts of superior wisdom - a pause for thought, a careful selection of strategic aims - doesn't appear to be happening.</p> <p>It's difficult and confusing, to be sure. The same companies pushing up prices on news shelves or trying to raise more cash from more TV commercials are also deeply involved with providing their basic product without charge: free news on a free internet, or seemingly free news every time you turn on a radio set or 24-hour TV news channel. What's supposedly precious is also ubiquitous - which in turn gives the stock markets the shakes, and saw ITV drop out of the FTSE 100.</p> <p>Take that vital step back for a moment, though. Sir Martin Sorrell, the supreme ad guru, told 100 assembled ITV managers last week that his clients 'are looking for mass audiences, high market shares and interesting content ... You've got to remember that you're not going to cut your way to growth.' Quality counts. But so does producing something that people can and will buy.</p> <p>One problem with newspaper sales was apparent long before anyone mentioned the internet. Because home delivery systems were so frail, circulation depended on news stands, which didn't suit regular buying habits in a hard-working, constantly rushing life. So, day by day, customers switched between titles - or simply gave the lot of them a miss. Where once a family might have bought five papers a week, now they bought four, three, two, one ... Price mattered - and so did sheer size. </p> <p>Editors piled in extra coverage and extra sections. Marketing teams piled in more free gifts, wall charts, DVDs. Publishers piled on bulk giveaway copies and foreign 'sales' to keep their figures looking respectable (witness the Telegraph giving away 99,000 copies a day or the Indie sending 55,000 abroad). But now the music has stopped.</p> <p>Perhaps the New York Times might find that a terser, but cheaper, paper will sell better through the week. Perhaps bulk in whatever form doesn't hit the spot any longer. Perhaps real sales figures without giveaway illusions would release money to invest in quality. Perhaps ploughing investment into internet sites to persuade readers to shift, then giving them free Hitchcock movies to tempt them to stay, is confusion compounded. Perhaps the moment for a decisive shift in expectations - defining anew what media analysts expect from company earnings - has finally arrived. </p> <p> The aim in recession, we were told 16 years ago when the last one happened, was to come out stronger as it ended. And many newspapers and broadcasters did. That's where profit expectations were set. The aim this time ought to be just the same in a new, tough landscape where Lidl things mean a lot.</p> <h2>Now you can read about it on screen</h2> <p>Here's a personal question. How do you read your newspaper; and how do you read your news on the net?</p> <p>Probable answer: you flip through the paper, turning the pages, absorbing pictures and headlines, stopping when something catches your interest - but you go to the net with specific intent, Googling, digging deeper.</p> <p>In sum, a newspaper tells you many unexpected things which you didn't know in the process of telling you what you wanted to know, while a website deals in expected things that you already know you need to know. So format matters.</p> <p>The current chorus of industry pundits prophesying newspaper doom thinks it knows that the net will one day be king. Look at sales and hope sliding away! But it never pauses, amid such gloom, to inquire what the conventional desk-bound net itself will amount to at that future point.</p> <p>Not as rich as it might be, perhaps. The monarch of Google himself was recently caught saying that ads on mobile phones would rule the global revenue roost one day, a triumph of individual targeting.</p> <p>Plastic Logic (from Cambridge University via San Diego) launched its new electronic reader last week: thinner than a pad of notepaper, lighter than a magazine, with a big, big screen (8.5in by 11) and the look, if not feel, of reading paper. Just right for a briefcase - and just right, too, for reading digitalised newspapers via broadband on the morning train to Euston.</p> <p>You can turn from page to page, as though you were holding a newsprint bundle. You can pause, perfectly normally, over tales that surprise you, news that you didn't know.</p> <p>This new net tool, in sum, seems on the cusp of fulfilling a newspaper's basic function. But when that comes to pass, it isn't life or death: just doing the basics without the need for presses, lorries, defunct forests and 60 per cent of your existing costs.</p> <p>Don't sign up for the temple of doom too soon, then. All of its pillars are moving parts.</p> <h2>James and the giant speech</h2> <p>Hear him in front of an audience, and James Murdoch, pictured, the rising son, is both technocratic and charismatic: he can talk the talk. Watch him in managerial action, too, at News International or BSkyB, and you know he can walk the walk.</p> <p>But somehow, corporate pen in hand, the impact isn't quite the same: somewhere between sub-Shakespearean and oleaginous.</p> <p>A few days ago, for instance, he bade farewell to Camilla Rhodes, formerly MD of the Times and the Sun. 'She epitomises the can-do spirit of this company,' declared young James. 'Her skill and dedication have been an inspiration and she has made an enormous contribution to our success for almost three decades. She will be sorely missed.' So why is she going, then? Don't ask. </p> <p>And as for the final decision, after many years of looking in estate agents' windows, not to move the whole London caboodle after all: 'Wapping is important not only as a physical site but also as a symbol of how bold individuals, working together, can advance the world of media and thereby contribute to life in Britain.'. Cry God for Harry, England and my dad ...</p> <h2>Would you Adam and Eve it?</h2> <p>Consider proportionality and its responses. Channel Four is screening The Sex Education Show at 8pm on Tuesdays. It necessarily features certain basic genitalia; 2.6 million viewers watch it; 39 of them complain to Ofcom. Is that, as the omniscient regulator trundles into action, a cause for shock and horror? Must television do sex education early, without sex - or after the 9pm watershed when most sensible people have gone to bed anyway?</p> <h2>Dodgy journalism</h2> <p>Leading on a poll is often dodgy journalism. Leading on a US presidential poll is simply flimsy. As this column is written, the nine major American polls are split four to Obama, three to McCain and two all square. Widest variant on one side: Obama with 48 per cent, McCain with 39 per cent; and on the other, McCain 54 per cent, Obama 44 per cent. Big country plus small samples equals prudently small headlines.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Las Vegas, 23 July 2008</strong></p> <p>Late morning in Henderson, the nice suburban neighbourhood Brandon Flowers calls home, and the Killers frontman is in his kitchen. He is, as is his wont, fretting. He has to leave soon for another day's work at the band's new recording studio. This is in an anonymous Las Vegas industrial space, about a 15-minute drive from where each of the four members of the band live: Flowers, Dave Keuning (the guitarist), Mark Stoermer (bass), Ronnie Vannucci (drums). Battle Born they have called it, following the motto on their state flag, a reference to Nevada joining the Union side during the American Civil War. </p> <p>'It's exciting to branch out. We were talking about the studio maybe being a business venture, hiring it out,' says Flowers. 'It's been great to go in and not have to worry about who's listening.' As the Killers work on their third album, a record that has to top everything they've done before - otherwise the super-zealous Flowers might as well just give up - privacy is paramount. They recorded its predecessor, 2006's Sam's Town, in a studio inside the Palms Casino Resort, one of Vegas's ritziest joints. 'And it's great not to worry about who's going to pop in because they're gambling and they're a high-roller and they want to see the fucking studio.' As befits a man of religious faith, Flowers doesn't swear much. So when he does you get a real measure of his exasperation. 'Playboy bunnies too!' Family man Flowers didn't like that either. 'There was all craziness at the Palms. So now, definitely we're more productive.'</p> <p>The Killers are America's oddest successful act: four members who look like they should be in four different groups; working-class kids from heartland America - rather than the cosmopolitan coasts - with a love of flamboyance. Committed lovers of Eighties British pop (as evidenced on their first album, Hot Fuss) turned stadium-rock rabble-rousers who dug Bruce Springsteen and the Wild West on the follow-up, Sam's Town</p> <p>Alongside their joyous disco and rock anthems sit dark songs about trauma, salvation and death: 'Uncle Jonny' dealt with Flowers's cocaine-crazed relative's conviction that aliens were after his sperm (so he tried to shoot his testicles off); 'Bling (Confession of a King)' told how Flowers's father recanted alcoholism and Catholicism to become a Mormon.</p> <p>The singer's love of the Morrissey B-side 'Sister I'm a Poet' led to the writing of the band's 'Murder Trilogy' - 'Jenny Was a Friend of Mine', 'Midnight Show' and 'Leave the Bourbon on the Shelf'. Flowers ploughed this macabre route more deeply with 'Where is She?', inspired by the murder of a 14-year-old Scottish girl, Jodi Jones, by her goth boyfriend in 2003. Flowers wrote the song from the viewpoint of the victim's mother, not stopping to think of the upset this might cause.</p> <p>Oh yes. At 27, Flowers is five years younger than his bandmates and the oddest of them all. Lovely, but odd. Phobic about flying, and about the number 621 (his birthday is 21 June). Like his parents and siblings, a Mormon. A young husband and the father to a 13-month-old son, Ammon. Thoughtful and considerate, but also a control freak. An arch-patriot who doesn't seem sure of his politics. He was once quoted as saying he was 'sympathetic to George Bush' and when I'm with him, he mentions approvingly a recent copy of Newsweek which bore the headline 'What Bush Did Right'. But he recently retracted that earlier quote, saying 'I'm in the middle with my beliefs, like everyone else' and to me he talks enthusiastically about Barack Obama.</p> <p>And he's ambitious. Flowers wants the Killers' name in big lights, for ever and ever, amen. And he'll put in the micro-managing effort to achieve what it takes.</p> <p>'Brandon will turn in 14-hour days, day after day after day,' Stuart Price says admiringly. The Reading-born musician and producer (previous bands: Les Rhythmes Digitales, Zoot Woman; previous clients: Madonna, Seal) has become, in some ways, the fifth member of the Killers. He did the 'Thin White Duke' remix of 'Mr Brightside' that the band loved so much. Then, as exploratory recordings, he produced 'Leave the Bourbon on the Shelf' and 'Sweet Talk', which appeared on last November's B-sides-and-more compilation Sawdust. The band had tried and failed to record 'Sweet Talk' for Sam's Town.</p> <p>Price and the Killers clicked. On his first visit to Price's home studio in London, lifelong Anglophile Flowers noted the pictures of David Bowie and Brian Eno on the wall. 'I knew we'd found our man,' recalls Flowers. Now Price is working with them on the follow-up to Sam's Town and Sawdust, and to Hot Fuss before them. Together those albums have sold 12m copies worldwide, helping make the Killers - as one US magazine had it - America's Best British Band. Quick-paced computer whizz Price, the son of two classical pianists, has proved a great foil for Flowers. 'It's in him like it's in us,' says the singer. 'Brandon's meticulous over things and really works at it,' says the producer. 'He's one of those people where it's in his blood. It's a real admirable quality.'</p> <p>But in Las Vegas, even 14-hour days aren't enough right now. Flowers, with whom most of the band's songs begin, is agonising over a couple of unfinished numbers.</p> <p>Actually, right now he's happier talking about clothes. He's the perfect age to be a Nirvana kid but Flowers hated grunge, in part because it was so dowdy, partly 'because it sucked the fun out of things'. His teenage love of British music was heard through a prism of style: Echo &amp; the Bunnymen's trenchcoats, Morrissey's flowers, Bowie's chameleonism, Pet Shop Boys' sartorial wit, Oasis's post-football casual swagger. 'I almost follow the music through fashion.' </p> <p>Thus the Killers were dandies from day one. They blazed out of Sin City wearing pastel jackets and make-up and eye-watering shirts. As the laconic, slightly spacey Keuning will recall of their first show as a foursome, in a Las Vegas club called the Junkyard in August 2002, 'even then, people were like, \"Who do these guys think they are?\" Well, anybody can wear a T-shirt and jeans. But this is a show and we want to look good and we want to have fun. I think I had a pink shirt on.' Pause. 'I got rid of that shirt.' </p> <p>After the British Eighties disco look (and sound) of Hot Fuss, the Killers went native for Sam's Town. It was a record that sounded like widescreen America and it had the boots, bootlace ties and waistcoats to prove it.</p> <p>'With Sam's Town,' says wisecracking life-and-soul Vannucci, 'I think we had just been on tour [promoting Hot Fuss], visiting all these new places, being detached from our desert home.' Indeed: before the release of Hot Fuss, Brandon Flowers had never had a passport. 'Being away from family, remembering where you come from, was probably heavy on Brandon's mind,' the drummer continues. 'And one thing just flowed into the next. It was never, \"OK guys, let's dress up like fucking cowboys!\"' Vannucci thinks that look might have started with the Anton Corbijnshoot for the album sleeve with the photographer 'playing dressing up...' But, he insists, this was not post-Joshua Tree-style affectation. 'Vegas is not about the Palms Hotel casino and black shiny shirts. If you're local, it's more about horseshit and gunsmoke! So that's what we brought to the stage.' And, in the drummer's case, an extravagant My Name is Wyatt Earp moustache.</p> <p>Anyway, Flowers wants to underscore this: that look, and that sound, they're all in the past. The Killers as extras from Deadwood? It's so 2007. For album proper number three, the band are going wilder still. 'Sam's Town was very specific. It was a return home album,' says the quiet Stoermer, a former medical student with whom still waters run very deep. 'This new album is perhaps more progressive and... I don't want to say global, but it's more universal.' </p> <p>On the Killers' new album, to be called Day and Age, there are synths involved. There are big rousing tunes, for sure. But there are also harpsichords, moonscapes, saxophones, brass, strings, feathers and fur and steel drums. Steel drums? </p> <p>'Seriously, the last time I heard steel drums was in The Little Mermaid!' Flowers exclaims. 'I don't know if that's a good reason or not to use them.'</p> <p>Right then. Studio time. Brandon Flowers leaves his kitchen, still fretting. </p> <p><strong>Dublin, 20-21 August </strong></p> <p>Fifteen minutes after they come offstage at the Academy in the Irish capital, the Killers' small and busy dressing room under the stairs is sweltering. </p> <p>Ronnie Vannucci is forced to stand in the corridor outside to talk to Jack Black. The actor-cum-comedy-rocker's band Tenacious D are in town to support Metallica at Marlay Park. Vannucci and Black are guffawing about the perennial rock star problem of overly sweaty gussets. Brandon Flowers, still wired and still perspiring from the performance, sits on a chair, both knees doing the St Vitus Dance. He's digging into a full size box of bran flakes, shovelling the dry cereal into his mouth but taking care to avoid the raisins. Mark Stoermer idly fingers a leather case containing champagne and Guinness. It's a gift from Dublin's favourite sons, and the band the Killers most want to emulate. A card inside reads: 'Welcome to Dublin from The U2'ers'. Their manager, Paul McGuinness, stands by the doorway, chatting. 'He owns the space around him,' Flowers will later chuckle. 'Makes our manager nervous!' </p> <p>Flowers, too, is a little nervous. Tonight's 850-capacity club show, a warm-up for tomorrow night's show at Marlay Park, which is itself a warm-up for headline slots at the Reading and Leeds festivals, was great. The band played a quasi-acoustic version of 'Smile Like You Mean It', with Flowers at the piano. Their decidedly strange collaboration with Lou Reed, last year's 'Tranquilize' single, worked well. Two new songs, 'Neon Tiger' and 'Spaceman', were greeted enthusiastically by the crowd. But Flowers's racing brain is already on to the next hurdle. Chatting to McGuinness, he discovers that U2's new album is scheduled for release a week before theirs. How do they follow that? 'So there's U2, Oasis, Snow Patrol, Keane, Kaiser Chiefs...' He ticks off the autumn's big albums on his fingers (the U2 record later shifts to next year). Shit. Lot of competition. Flowers chomps at his cereal with agitated gusto.</p> <p>You might say they haven't made things easy for themselves. The Killers interrupted recording on Day and Age to embark on a month-long tour: a handful of small North American shows followed by this run of European festival dates. Then they are heading to London to hook up with Stuart Price again and finish the album. Everything is running impossibly close to deadline.</p> <p>After midnight the Killers leave the club and drive the few hundred yards back to their hotel. Flowers's wife Tana and infant son are upstairs but he lingers in the lobby with a laptop, poring over new band photographs till 1am. Some feature the four-piece seemingly standing on the moon. In others, Flowers is wearing a Dolce &amp; Gabbana jacket with elaborate fur and feather epaulettes designed by British fashionista Fee Doran. She was introduced to Flowers by Stuart Price, for whom she once made a black leather catsuit. She's most famous for making the white hooded jumpsuit Kylie Minogue wore in the 'Can't Get You Out of My Head' video. </p> <p>'Sci-fi jungle!' says Vannucci, jokingly, of the new look that the band - well, the more outr\u00e9 Flowers and Keuning - will be rocking. 'It's the new emo! No longer neo-synth fetishists, we're sci-fi jungle! No more Wyatt Earp moustache, although I could grow it back in a few hours...'</p> <p>The next day Flowers and I sit down with tea and cookies in the deserted hotel restaurant. Last night, once he got over his collywobbles about the U2 album, he seemed friendly and relaxed but today, talking about the new album properly for the first time, there are nerves.</p> <p>I say to Flowers: you said that Sam's Town was about embracing more of your own culture. Did you achieve that?</p> <p>'Well, what's goofy is, America didn't care! Over here in the UK they did. It's sitting alongside Hot Fuss [in sales]. But in America it did half of what Hot Fuss did - 1.5m rather than 3m. So it just shows you how cynical people can be. We were trying to do something heartfelt - and it was heartfelt.'</p> <p>How did an avowedly American record fail to sell well in America?</p> <p>'It was kind of cursed from the start. The press were really rough on it.' The Killers were particularly aggrieved with a two-out-of-five review in Rolling Stone. 'I mean, just for having 'When You Were Young' on it, it deserves better than what it got. That song will be around for ever.'</p> <p>Did Americans think you were trying too hard to be Americans?</p> <p>'Maybe. We came out with Hot Fuss and were wearing suits and there's make-up and there's glitz. Definitely they saw [the Sam's Town look] as being contrived. I absolutely understand that now when I look at it. It's a never-ending battle for me. We were these poor kids and the whole idea of being a band was to put ourselves out there as this glamorous thing. Almost the opposite of the Strokes - these wealthy kids who are these dirty rock'n'rollers. Instead of dirtying it up, it was about excess and overindulgence and names and Gucci. It's almost a hip hop thing. Bling, that's kinda what it was like.'</p> <p>Improbable as it may seem, the none-more-vanilla Flowers is hip hop in other ways - shooting his mouth off, proclaiming his own greatness while panning others. It's not the Killers' fault that Sam's Town didn't sell as well as Hot Fuss at home - it was 'cynical' America which didn't 'get' the album. He's open in his desire for the Killers to be a stadium-sized act, to catch up with Coldplay and join up with U2 on the top 'pedestal... They're getting old. You know there's going to be a coupla songs on [U2's new] record you're just going to love. They're unbelievable. But there's gotta be... I dunno, it feels like it's time.'</p> <p>Last time we spoke he accused Thom Yorke of wasting his talent by not writing such catchy tunes any more. He laid into Green Day for un-American activity: recording a concert DVD in Milton Keynes ('I just thought it was really cheap. To go to a place like England and sing American Idiot...'). Now, he admits ruefully, 'that didn't help us out either [in America]. People love Green Day. Anyone that maybe would have been on the fence with us, that was a real decider that they didn't like us.' Flowers regrets the diss, then, but mainly because it hit his own band's sales.</p> <p>According to the man who made it, meanwhile, Sam's Town was directly influenced by Springsteen and was one of the best albums of the past 20 years. These vainglorious quotes are still following the Killers round now.</p> <p>'Yeah, he shouldn't have said any of that crap!' says Keuning with a snort. 'I hadn't thought about Springsteen once... Now he's probably a little bit more careful. I didn't agree with the things he said. Those things don't necessarily represent the band. He was just excited about Sam's Town when he said that 20 years thing, but I had no idea how bad it was going to bite us in the ass.'</p> <p>'The thing I love about Brandon is that he says whatever the fuck he thinks,' says Price. 'And he doesn't care if he's blowing six litres of smoke up his own arse or in someone else's face. That is so refreshing, to have someone that just goes: \"Fuck it, I want to be the best and this is what I think.\" And he backs that up with hard work.'</p> <p>He's a funny bloke, Brandon. He has a heart of gold, is thoroughly likable and is staggeringly charismatic on stage. He can write pop hits and stadium anthems seemingly at will. But he's also supremely jittery, occasionally paranoid and easily rattled. It's like he always has something to prove - a legacy, perhaps, of being the baby of his family. He's the youngest of six; his nearest sibling, Shane, is 12 years older than him. It's handsome, born-on-the-4th-of-July Shane (as mentioned in the lyrics to 'Sam's Town') whom young Brandon was always trying to catch up with.</p> <p>All this can make him come over as aloof and distant. His interview posture is bolt upright like a schoolboy, or arms firmly folded like a shield. It all helps lead to statements of intent that read terribly baldly in print. </p> <p>Why do you think many people have a problem with your ambition? </p> <p>'I don't know. I guess they like it better if you just keep your head down and all that. I'm not sure what bothers them so much about it.'</p> <p>Because they see you as a craven careerist?</p> <p>'I've seen that before. The singer of Idlewild said I was like Pete Sampras. He could see it in my eyes - dead, cold, a drive, ready to step on whoever I need to. And I'm not like that at all.'</p> <p>Anyway, golf is your game.</p> <p>[Grinning] 'Yeah. Tiger Woods, please. But it's just about the songs.'</p> <p>It's excitement rather than a rampant ego that propels you to talk up your records?</p> <p>'Yes. That's it. I've never been able to explain it easily. I don't wake up and say, \"I'm the greatest.\"'</p> <p><strong>That night the Killers play Marlay Park to a sold-out </strong>crowd of 32,000, the biggest audience they've ever drawn on their own (that is, other than when they've played at festivals). There is satisfaction within the Killers camp that Metallica didn't sell out the previous night. The 16-song set is blisteringly good. The by-now-traditional set-closing encore is the glorious 'All These Things That I've Done', Flowers's song about struggling to reconcile his Mormon faith with the temptations facing a man and a rock star. As Killers crowds always do, the entire park begins singing the chorus while the band are offstage, readying for the encore: 'I've got soul but I'm not a soldier...' It's spine-tingling to hear.</p> <p>Throughout the show a member of the Killers' entourage takes pictures from the side of the stage. These days he is the only photographer allowed to shoot the band live. After gigs, the media are invited to pick shots that the band have selected to put up on a special website. Later I ask Flowers why such an edict is necessary.</p> <p>'Ah-ha-ha,' he laughs nervously. He begins by saying that the ban on outside photographers was in response to publications tending to use the same kind of image repeatedly: him with his mouth wide open, singing. Or, as he puts it, 'the screaming moment... It just to got to be - well, for me, I didn't like it.'</p> <p>And is it correct that you'll only be filmed head-on, not from underneath?</p> <p>'Yeah. Why? It's a very unflattering place to have your picture taken. You can't avoid looking like you have a double chin, especially if you're singing and opening your mouth and screaming. It's a misrepresentation.'</p> <p>But you're lean and in good shape.</p> <p>'I'm lean. But I'm not as lean as the dreams of.... Iggy Pop and the good old days.'</p> <p>Would you say you were vain, Brandon?</p> <p>[Laughing] 'I don't know if it means I'm vain. I'm cautious!'</p> <p>And you like being in control?</p> <p>'Well, you know, it's our destiny that we're playing with here.'</p> <p>Presumably you appreciate that your banning photographers from your shows will be construed as controlling and egomaniacal?</p> <p>'Yeah, I don't understand that. I don't mind it. People can think what they want to think.'</p> <p><strong>London, 3 September</strong></p> <p>Last night the Killers partied. Brandon Flowers collected the award for Most Stylish Man at GQ's Men of the Year event at the Royal Opera House. He smoked cigarettes and drank champagne and ended the night at celeb hang-out Bungalow 8. He's a practising Mormon but not 100 per cent observant, although his son is named after a prophet in the Book of Mormon. How has having a child affected his faith?</p> <p>'It's kind of solidified it.' He pauses, wary of discussing religion - he's enough of a student of music history to know that the holy rock'n'roller is a precarious route to go down. 'I feel like it's an arrogant thought to think we're an accident, or that we're this smart without a little bit of a help. I just think it's a miracle.'</p> <p>For some people, childbirth reaffirms their faith in creationism; a higher power had a hand...</p> <p>'Yeah, definitely. It's definitely made me... And it's made me a lot less selfish too, so it's good. I love music, but I look at it more as my job now than I did. Now I'm going off to work. Now I almost think I'm doing this for him and for his future. Everything's changed. There's all kinds of shit brewing in my brain. I wonder if it's weird that I get manicures! Ha ha ha! My dad didn't get manicures, I don't know if I should... Why do I? I dunno! Because they give you a massage at the end of it. It feels nice.'</p> <p>We're talking in Olympic Studios in Barnes, south-west London. The Killers have two-and-a-half days to finish Day and Age. The tight schedule has meant they had to nix yesterday's planned recording session with Elton John: he and Flowers have written a Christmas song (the Killers' third), called 'Joseph, Better You Than Me'.</p> <p>The band play me a handful of new songs. 'Human', the first single, is a Pet Shop Boys-style synth-pop zoomer that should please fans of 'Mr Brightside'. 'Losing Touch' is driven by blasts of dirty saxophone. 'I Can't Stay' is brilliantly wonky: steel drums, harpsichords and a shuffling rhythm which Keuning describes as 'stranded on an island', and which Flowers admits was taken from Unit 4+2's 1965 British No 1 'Concrete and Clay' (he heard it on the soundtrack to Rushmore). And on the 'Club Tropicana'-esque 'Joyride', the Killers got the funk. </p> <p>On one listen it's thrilling, the sound of America's most adventurous big-hitters spinning off in umpteen new directions. As Stuart Price says: 'I think the wrongness is part of the thing that appeals to Europeans about the Killers.'</p> <p>'A Dustland Fairytale' is more reminiscent of the grand rock of Sam's Town. Studded with punchy piano, it sounds like a Jim Steinman production. It features lines like 'slick chrome American prince', 'long brown hair and foolish eyes', and 'white trash county'. It's the story of how Flowers's mum and dad met - they were both aged 15 and lived on the same trailer park.</p> <p>The song that's causing Flowers most trouble is 'Goodnight, Travel Well'. Set to be the album's closer and running to almost seven minutes, it's a tribute to Dave Keuning's recently deceased mother, and to Brandon Flowers's mum, who has a brain tumour (he says she's responding 'really well to the chemo and the radiation so far'). He needs to get the lyrics right: tender but not mawkish. I hear the unfinished version. It's a gothic symphony, bursting with brass and strings.</p> <p>As Flowers describes it: 'It goes from being the darkest thing we've ever done before shooting up to the clouds at the end. Oh, it's a heartbreaker. It just rips your guts out.'</p> <p>If Flowers can face singing it night after night, it should be a great main set closer.</p> <p>'We use the analogy of too much chocolate. That's maybe how Killers shows have been in the past, sometimes it's too much - we don't have our ups and downs. It's been a real breath of fresh air doing the songs from Sawdust and the stripped down 'Smile Like You Mean it'. It's not just in your face the whole time. It really felt like a real band. A more mature...' Flowers stops and smiles. 'Men were up there playing.'</p> <p>Right then. Studio time. The Killers have a little over 48 hours to nail the finale to the album that, if all goes to plan, will keep them on the road until the end of 2010. The only way is up. In terms of sound and in terms of stature, their ambition knows no bounds. If Brandon Flowers, baby of the family and baby of the band, has anything to do with it, the world's record-buying, concert-going masses will be moved.</p> <p>'I have an unexplainable drive,' he cheerfully admits. 'I don't know exactly where it comes from, but it borders on obsession. There's something special about bringing that many people together and celebrating that way. I want that! I am greedy and selfish but I want that every night.'</p> <h2>Bigmouth strikes again: Brandon Flowers bitches</h2> <p>'I can see the Strokes play or Franz Ferdinand play and it's real, and I haven't gotten that from the Bravery. I think people will see through them.'<br><strong>March 2005</strong></p> <p>'We have a song called \"Midnight Show\" and in America they love it. In England they don't move at all. What's wrong with them?' <br><strong>April 2005</strong></p> <p>'What song do I hate? I think 'Daughters' by John Mayer would be a good candidate.' <br><strong>2005</strong></p> <p>On Fall Out Boy: 'Emo is dangerous. There's a creature inside me that wants to beat all those bands to death.' <br><strong>June 2006</strong></p> <p>On Thom Yorke: 'He should feel grateful that he's [been] given the gift to write pop songs - which he needs to write again.' <br><strong>September 2006</strong></p> <p>On Green Day filming their American Idiot DVD in the UK: 'I saw it as a very negative thing towards Americans. It really lit a fire in me.' <br><strong>October 2006</strong></p> <p>'I think people are lazy, and that goes for making music too.' <br><strong>November 2006</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Day and Age (Mercury) will be released on 24 November</p>",
  "<p>If the leader's speech at a party conference can be likened to a general rallying his troops, Nick Clegg has an unusually difficult task this week. Before firing up his soldiers, he has first to identify the enemy. </p> <p>This is an old problem for a party that is used to fighting on two fronts, three counting the Scottish Nationalists. But the task was made easy at the last election when the Tories looked bitter and reactionary and Labour support was divided over Iraq. That made the Lib Dems the natural repository for liberal protest, and they duly won their highest ever tally of seats.</p> <p>But now David Cameron has recast the Conservative party as both 'liberal' and 'progressive', concerned about the environment, activist on social justice, prepared to devolve power away from a bureaucratic, centralised state. That transformation has been rewarded with a commanding poll lead.</p> <p>Many Lib Dems are outraged by the Tory raid on their beliefs, which they feel must be a con. Surely, they posit, if pulled hard enough, Mr Cameron's mask will come away and a familiar foe will be revealed underneath.</p> <p>The Lib Dems have seemed reluctant to focus their fire on the Conservatives because they risk looking like junior campaign partners to an unpopular government. </p> <p>Additionally, Nick Clegg has made clear his strategic priority at the next election - taking seats from Labour in areas, mostly in the North of England, where the Tory revival is weakest. For these reasons, the Lib Dems have been preoccupied with Labour, while failing to engage with a resurgent Conservative party.</p> <p>The danger is that, by continuing to concentrate on a beleaguered Labour party, they risk being left out of the central narrative of the next election - what does David Cameron stand for? </p> <p>The polls suggest that the Tory leader is Prime Minister in waiting. The next election will be about David Cameron. If the Lib Dems continue to aim at Labour, they may find themselves pointing at the wrong target. </p> <p>If Clegg and the Lib Dems believe that the Cameron project is vulnerable to proper scrutiny, then they will have to find the language and policies to marshal these arguments. But they need to do more. Alongside tackling their opponents, they need to spell out their vision of liberal democracy. We know of their credentials on civil liberties, the environment and their opposition to the Iraq war. But amid rising fuel and food prices, a depressed housing market, rising unemployment and global shifts of power to the East, voters will want to know how they are going to address the nation's growing anxiety over our financial security. The Lib Dems need to tell the country what their plans are for education, hospitals and taxation.</p> <p>They can credibly claim to have foreseen the current problems ahead of their rivals and to be more agile in their response. Vince Cable warned that loose credit was stoking a housing bubble and saddling people with unmanageable debt long before the economy went crunch. He also argued consistently that nationalisation of Northern Rock was inevitable, while Gordon Brown dithered and the Tories raved about the ills of statism.</p> <p>As for measures to mitigate hardship, the Liberal Democrats are alone in proposing straightforward redistribution, increasing taxes for the wealthiest and cutting them for the poorest. Through the boom years New Labour held fast to the orthodox Thatcherite view that taxes on wealth penalise success, discourage entrepreneurship, stymie growth and hinder job creation. But the nation's first recession in 16 years, and possibly the most severe one for a generation, should be occasion for questioning received economic wisdom. The voters know it. Some Labour MPs say it. But only the Lib Dems seem willing to express it as policy.</p> <p>The problem, as ever, is that voters also know that Lib Dem policies are unlikely to be enacted, at least not by a Lib Dem government, not any time soon. The party has a problem turning passing appreciation of their principled stands - on the environment, civil liberties, Iraq - into enduring loyalty at the ballot box. As disaffection with the government turns to contempt, voters are not just protesting against Labour, they are looking for the surest way to evict them. That has traditionally meant voting Conservative. </p> <p>Nick Clegg hopes that sufficient exposure to policy arguments will convince people that his party offers a more consistent and authentically liberal, progressive agenda than the Tories. That is the scale of his challenge in Bournemouth this week.</p>",
  "<p>Time for some poetry!' yells the diminutive figure on stage. He has finally got the crowd in this Amsterdam club bubbling ... and then he opts to kill the atmosphere stone-dead by cutting the music and mentioning poetry? But then, this is Lil Wayne, the Louisiana MC routinely referred to - often by himself - as 'the best rapper alive'. A man credited with inventing the term 'bling bling', way back in 1998, when he was just 15. A man recently namechecked by Barack Obama. So this poem is bound to be some deep shit, perhaps involving the ongoing struggles of his native New Orleans, or black-on-black violence in America's inner cities, or even Obama's bid to become the first President of colour. An anticipatory hush descends. And, having got our full attention, Lil Wayne begins his recitation.</p> <p>'Roses are red! Violets are blue! I love my Euros! But bitch... I don't love you!' Lil Wayne holds out his arms and waits for the Amsterdam massive to show him their love. The crowd, at least 40 per cent female, withhold their affection in favour of bemused silence. Dead poets spin in their graves, like records on turntables.</p> <p>Dwayne Michael Carter Jr is a bona fide phenomenon. At a time when the music industry can't give away CDs, his sixth solo album, Tha Carter III, has sold two million copies in two months in America alone. The lead single, a winsome R&amp;B-ish sex ditty called 'Lollipop', was No.1 in America for five weeks. Even the radio-unfriendly 'official street single', a stunningly innovative meld of braggadocious metaphor and minimalist electro called 'A Milli', reached No.6. And unlike many a superstar rapper, the 25-year-old Carter has climbed gradually to this level of success, serving his apprenticeship as part of teen rap group the Hot Boys in 1997 before launching his solo career with 1999's Tha Block is Hot. It was street and internet support, rather than radio and TV, that broke Wayne, as each subsequent record has been more successful than the last. </p> <p>But Tha Carter III isn't just a commercial leap for Lil Wayne, aka Weezy Baby. On previous records he was little more than a standard, money-gunz-bitchez MC. On this one he mixes the usual ghetto superstar lyrics with surreal flights of fancy, great jokes, different voices, different flows. His unmistakable southern croak takes as much from Howlin' Wolf as from Busta Rhymes, and the likes of 'A Milli', 'Dr Carter' and 'Mrs Officer' are hip hop classics. Add the baby face, muscular, tattooed bod, Marley-esque dreads, perpetually stoned demeanour and cash-obsessed work ethic, and you have a perfect rap icon for the times. </p> <p>The perception that Lil Wayne is hip hop's anointed one is heightened by 'Mr Carter', one of the best tracks from the album, on which Jay-Z (real name Shawn Carter, lest we forget) guests and refers to Wayne as 'my heir'. But to match Jay Z's achievements, Wayne has to move from popular roughneck rapper to suave transcendent icon, preferably marrying the (preferably much shorter) equivalent of Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles along the way. It took Jay-Z 12 years of platinum-shifting success before he became a household name on this side of the Atlantic, courtesy of Glastonbury and Jonathan Ross. So the first steps to going global for Wayne involve selling records in Europe and seducing hip cities like Amsterdam. </p> <p>So: is Lil Wayne hip hop's next superstar? Or a spliff-addled shortarse who only makes sense to 'da hood'? Ask Bryan 'Baby' Williams and he'll tell you, without hesitation, that Wayne can achieve 'more than anybody ever did, more than any hip hop artist ever did'. He might be a little biased, though. Williams who, along with his brother Ronald, runs Cash Money records, the label that Lil Wayne has recorded for since day one. It was Baby who discovered Carter in 1993, when he was just 11 years old. And the two have a bond so strong that Williams simply refers to him as 'my son'. Despite being part of the gifted child programme at his primary school, Wayne, who had an absent father, was tempted into a life of dealing drugs on his local streets. Williams's mentoring skills, along with his business sense, gave Wayne the opportunity to use that big brain for something altogether more constructive.</p> <p>So, when Lil Wayne travels to Amsterdam, Williams is right there with him ... along with the usual entourage of homeys and hangers-on. He turns out to be pretty mellow for a rap mogul. He's a late Eighties hip hop throwback, in his dodgy tracksuit and ludicrously large gold chain, wearing shades inside one of the city's coffee shops, switching between enormous joint and enormous cigar.</p> <p>'I met him in about '93, '94,' Williams recalls in a deep, gentle drawl. 'In front of a record store in New Orleans. When he rapped for me I gave him my card. He knew of me because New Orleans is so small. And he called me. Called me about a hundred times. So I told him to come down the studio. And he ain't never left me since.'</p> <p>Was Wayne in need of a father figure?</p> <p>'Where I come from, the block become your daddy. There's a lot of people get killed in New Orleans and a lot of us be raised without a daddy and end up in penitentiary or some shit. The block became my daddy. I didn't want that for anyone else. I wanted to try to help us get off the block. That was my goal because I watched my brothers and our pops go to penitentiary and get killed. You're introduced to the streets of New Orleans at a young age. Nine or ten years old. I didn't want them to take that path.'</p> <p>Is it true that your Cash Money crew invented the term 'bling'?</p> <p>'No ... Wayne did. We went into the studio and he had a song called \"Bling Bling\". We put it on the [fellow New Orleans rapper] BG album, but it was really Wayne created that.' </p> <p>So you were in the room when a globally recognised word was invented. How does that feel?</p> <p>'It still hasn't hit us. But we know it's in the dictionary. I wish I'd had my business together then. I woulda made a fortune off it.'</p> <p>A couple of hours later, Lil Wayne is talking about the Rev Al Sharpton, the New York civil rights activist. 'The boy said something about me and the future and the kids and I'm not leading 'em in the right direction an' all that.'</p> <p>Lil Wayne has just called Sharpton 'the boy'. And 'boy' is one hell of a loaded term to apply to a black man, particularly when applied to a controversial 53-year-old Baptist minister, politician - and former tour manager for James Brown. I have just asked about 'DontGetIt', aka 'Misunderstood', the 10-minute epic that closes his latest album. What begins as a 2Pac-ish hip-hop ballad mutates gradually into a non-rhyming, state-of-the-American-nation address, which mutates into a gratuitous diss of Sharpton: 'You see, you are no MLK. You are no Jesse Jackson. You are nobody ... to me. You're just another Don King. With a perm.' </p> <p>Wayne was goaded into this by Sharpton's work with an organisation called Soap - Stop Offensive and Abusive Language In Hip Hop Through Personal Responsibility. One suspects that Soap will be having little effect on the morals of rappers unless they collectively suffer from a debilitating fear of bad acronyms. Nevertheless, Big Al has got Wayne's goat. 'I was just upset because, before you judge someone, why don't you talk to 'em? Don't make an opinion on me if you don't know nothin' about me.'</p> <p>The Lil Wayne I meet is polite, quietly spoken, a little stoned... the no-smoking rule in the hotel doesn't prevent the waft of dope nearly knocking you out when you walk in the room. He looks effortlessly cool: dapper checked baseball cap over his tumbling dreadlocks, shades covering somewhat bloodshot eyes. But the interview is a struggle: he's bored, distracted by the entourage, unwilling to be drawn into anything genuinely personal. I ask how important Baby Williams was to him as a young kid.</p> <p>'How important was he? He is very important to my life and my career. But how? Just too much. Because without him I wouldn't be here. I may still be rappin' but I don't know what I'd be rappin' about. I don't know if I'd have a direction. And this work ethic that I've got - I have to owe that only to Baby and Slim because they instilled it in me. Saying, \"If you want that lifestyle, where you pay out whatever you want and you do whatever you want... for that lifestyle you have to work.\" Extra hard. So I do.'</p> <p>Baby told me that, for young black kids in New Orleans, 'the block becomes your daddy' ...</p> <p>'Exactly. And it was already happening to me when I met Baby. But I think I was too smart ... and my mom would never let it happen. That's one good thing about my mom right there, 'cause she wouldn't have let it go down like that. You could go hang on the corner and kick it an' shit. But as for always being like dem niggas? Naw. No no no. She wouldn't let that happen.'</p> <p>Are you going to vote in the presidential elections?</p> <p>'No, I'm not registered ... I don't think I'm registered. I wish I could. I don't wanna use it as an excuse or nothin'.'</p> <p>So if you were ...</p> <p>'Barack. Yeah. I think he's a peacemaker. Which is great. Plus he's got a crazy [basketball] jumpshot, so...'</p> <p>Were you surprised when he mentioned you on his campaign trail?</p> <p>'Hell yeah, I was surprised. I was like, Wow! And the way he used it was, like, really cool.'</p> <p>So you agreed with what he said about too many black kids dropping out of school because they want to be rappers and sportsmen: 'Maybe you are the next Lil Wayne. But probably not, in which case you need to stay in school.'</p> <p>'Exactly. And I know it's true.'</p> <p>When Wayne hits the stage at Melkweg a few hours later to a rapturous reception, you can't help remembering that this is a kid who dropped out of school at the age of 14. It's a weird show, though. We watch from the side of the stage and would feel privileged if there weren't 60 other people crowding the space behind Wayne right along with us. If only some of the assorted lackeys, groupies and wannabes were musicians; the backing band comprises Wayne's manager putting on his client's CDs. On the plus side, the show lasts for almost 90 minutes. On the minus, every time a decent performance of a well-loved Weezy tune builds up the momentum, the music abruptly stops and Wayne starts faffing about. The pointlessly misogynist poem is followed by Wayne attempting to sing a cappella and proving only that he's virtually tone-deaf. And this is trumped by a bizarre interlude when he picks up an electric guitar and proceeds to play along so badly to one of his weaker tunes that it sounds like your five-year-old's first school concert. Admittedly, a brilliant performance of 'A Milli' and a rousing guest spot from his mentor Williams pick things up. But bemusement reigns again at the show's close when Carter leaves the stage in a woolly bathrobe while miming to Whitney Houston's version of 'I Will Always Love You'. The evening is a reminder of the bad old days when every hip hop show could be relied upon to disappoint.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Tha Carter III is a rarity... a genuinely great hip hop album that effortlessly melds hardcore with pop, aggression with humour, materialism with surrealism. Maybe great live shows will come with time. Earlier, I'd asked Carter how he responds to all those who feel that his obvious verbal skills are outweighed by all the usual misanthropic hip hop imagery, and that Lil Wayne is just another bad role model, leading kids astray. His response is surprisingly measured, but all the more convincing for its quiet determination. 'I know there are gonna be people like that for ever. But I want them to know that I'm gonna be doing this for as long as I can.'</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Lil' Wayne's double A-side single 'Mrs Officer'/ 'Mr Carter' (Universal) is released 6 October.</p>",
  "<p>Alitalia has become the latest victim of the global credit crunch, after it announced that its planes were unlikely to fly from tomorrow because it cannot afford to buy fuel.</p> <p>The dramatic announcement from the Italian airline came on the same day that thousands of customers of collapsed tour operator XL began arriving in the UK.

He had earlier vetoed a takeover by Air France-KLM, so the failure of the current bailout would represent a huge political embarrassment.</p> <p>Yesterday, he appeared to be attempting to pin the blame on the left and on the unions. He said 'political motivations that have nothing to do with the workers' demands' lay behind the union's refusal to accept the rescue plan. His statement came after a consortium, put together by the government and its advisers, walked out of talks with unions, saying there was no longer any room for negotiation.</p> <p>Fantozzi said he would begin arranging social security assistance for the crews of grounded aircraft tomorrow.</p> <p>Alitalia would be the first European flag-carrier to go bust since Sabena, of Belgium, and Swissair in 2001.</p> <p>At Fiumicino airport, in Rome, yesterday around 20 Alitalia workers staged a demonstration in the terminal, wearing sandwich boards as they paraded among the passengers. One of the slogans read: \"Berlusconi: 'I'll take care of it'\".</p> <p>As the crisis unfolded, Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson called for a review of the rules governing failed airlines. </p> <p>Branson, the president of Virgin Atlantic, said a new set of procedures should be brought in allowing a collapsed company's fleet to continue to fly under the watch of the aviation regulator. The Civil Aviation Authority has been forced to charter planes or fill spare seats on already scheduled flights as a result of XL's fleet being grounded.</p> <p>However, according to a Virgin spokesman, if the rules were changed so that special dispensation is given to failed airlines, allowing them to continue to fly, it would make for less disruption across the industry. </p> <p>'It does seem that there should be an urgent review, if there are going to be more airlines and tour operators becoming casualties of the credit crunch, of the way in which the rescue operation is conducted,' said Branson. 'It does not make sense for aircraft to be lying idle at airports in the UK when they should be used to bring back stranded passengers'</p> <p>He added: 'There is enormous pressure at the moment, within the aviation industry, to help with the rescue mission. We are happy to do, but it should not be like this in the future.'</p> <p>Hundreds more XL passengers were due to arrive back in the UK today, after being put on repatriation flights. </p> <p>The first of the stranded passengers arrived yesterday, but 10,000 others are at the back of the queue for replacement flights and could face lengthy delays and hefty airfares when they do fly. </p> <p>These are people who booked direct flights with the airline, or through the tour operator's website, XL.com, and are not covered by Atol, the scheme that protects package holiday bookings.</p> <p>'We are faced with a huge task to find replacement planes,' said a spokesman for Atol. 'People who booked flights only will have to arrange their own flights, or wait for spare tickets on the replacement flights at cost price.'</p> <p>Passengers waiting for replacement flights at Dalaman airport in Turkey yesterday found themselves split between those holding Freedom Flight tickets, issued as part of a package holiday with XL, and those with identical tickets for the same flights, but issued by the flight company direct.</p> <p>The Freedom Flight ticket-holders were ushered to an upstairs lounge in the airport, where they waited for transfers to free overnight hotel accommodation, before being given seats on a replacement flight home. Those who had booked directly with XL were left to fend for themselves.</p> <p>A spokesman for Monarch, which is running many of the replacement flights, said that any flight-only XL passengers would have to pay the normal last-minute ticket price to get on the planes. 'We are a low-fare airline, and our pricing model is that as tickets sell out, prices increase,' he said.</p> <p>Virgin Atlantic, which is offering spare seats on its scheduled flights at a discounted price to XL passengers, said most of the flights from Orlando, where many of the XL passengers are stranded, were full. 'XL passengers, especially those who are not at the top of the list, must face the fact that they are looking at a wait of at least a week before they can get a flight,' said Paul Charles, director of corporate communications at Virgin Atlantic.</p> <p>Skyscanner, a flight search engine website, reported a 269 per cent increase on flight searches for XL routes, since the news of the collapse broke.</p> <p>Many of the holidaymakers affected will have to travel to alternative American cities to get flights home and face hotel, transport and phone costs that could run into thousands of pounds. </p> <p>Meanwhile, passengers who made it back to the UK yesterday told of how they learnt of the airline's collapse via text messages from home, or saw the news on television. Some turned up at airports unaware that anything untoward had happened. </p> <p>Friends Kirsty Grant and Kelly Thompson, who arrived in Gatwick yesterday on a replacement Monarch flight from Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt, said that they spent the last day of their holiday in a 'mad panic'. </p> <p>Grant, aged 20, said: 'My mum sent me a text yesterday morning telling me I might have trouble getting home. We immediately went to find our rep, but she couldn't tell us anything; no one could tell us anything.' In a strange twist to proceedings, it later emerged that Iron Maiden singer Bruce Dickinson piloted the Sharm el-Sheikh flight. Marc Cryer, a passenger on board the plane, said he knew the musician was also a trained pilot but was still surprised to see him. 'I think I was the only person on the plane that recognised him,' he said. </p> <p>Passengers who have made it home, and those who will land today and tomorrow, make up only 'a small proportion' of the XL passengers affected, said the Atol spokesman. </p> <p>Holidaymakers are not the only ones to have been hit by the collapse of XL, which was a major corporate sponsor of children's medical research company Sparks. The charity said yesterday it was set to lose \u00a3150,000 a year as a result of the operator's demise.</p>",
  "<p>One of Britain's biggest investors will launch a campaign this week to persuade Shell and BP to drop their plans for heavy investment in oil sands and shale projects in North America.</p> <p>Co-operative Asset Management is concerned that the huge environmental costs of producing crude from oil sands or shale could change the economics of these so-called 'unconventional' fuel sources, putting the oil companies and their investors at risk of a huge wasted investment.</p> <p>Paul Monaghan, head of sustainability and social goals at the Co-op, points to research showing that extracting oil from shale creates eight times as many emissions as conventional oil production, while oil sands produce three times as much. While these sources are economic at current oil prices, a fall in crude or a rise in the price of carbon under the trading system could make them much more expensive. </p> <p>'The worry is that, within five years, it will be unstoppable,' said Monaghan. 'I think it is stoppable now.'</p> <p>The Co-op will enlist the support of other large institutional investors at a seminar outlining the issues this week. Niall O'Shea, a responsible shareholding analyst, said: 'We believe that companies investing heavily in unconventionals are too focused on short-term profit and their strategy is too defensive. They are becoming increasingly expensive to produce.'</p> <p>Shell is already committed to a $16bn (\u00a38.9bn) project aimed at generating 15 per cent of its production from unconventionals, while BP's investment is around $6bn. The amount of oil available is huge - the Canadian sands alone, situated largely in the province of Alberta, have around twice the total reserves of Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>The companies say that the higher emissions will be mitigated by carbon capture and storage schemes, but O'Shea says these will not be in operation until 2020. 'Oil sands [production] will be out long before that.' </p> <p>The exploitation of the oil sands is controversial even within North America. According to polls, some two thirds of Albertans support a moratorium on new projects until new environmental standards are in place. But the state government in Alberta is keen to attract investment from oil companies, leaving them to largely determine how to regulate their activities. As a result, critics say, the environmental rules are lax and loosely enforced.</p> <p>In the US, legislators have proposed a law which could restrict imports of the most polluting types of fossil fuels, such as that from oil sands. But Greg Stringham of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers dismissed this move as 'rhetoric': 'I do not think the US is in a position to choose what kind of oil it gets. The US has spoken a lot about energy security, so it will not want to jeopardise supplies from Canada - a safe, close, and growing source.'</p>",
  "<p>The final straw came when McDonald's moved to open a restaurant close to Rome's Spanish Steps in 1986. A horrified group of campaigners picketed the fast-food giant - and while they didn't prevent McDonald's from opening, they did spawn a global movement celebrating all things unhurried. Over the years, somewhat ironically, the Slow Movement gathered pace, and sympathetic splinter campaigns have emerged. Slow travel, slow shopping and even slow sex have all been campaigned for - and now there is a drive for slow building. </p> <p>Architects Proctor &amp; Matthews are leading the way by launching Slo Homes, which stands for Simple Living Opportunities. 'A Slo home looks for the antidote to the fast pace of 21st-century living - a place to relax and take time to appreciate the simple things of home life,' says Stephen Proctor. 'Slo homes refocus and celebrate domestic life around the heart of the home.'</p> <p>'It's all about families getting back to cooking more, relaxing more and celebrating what is important in life,' adds Andrew Matthews, Proctor's partner in the firm. 'Kitchens are the centre of the house in a Slo home. We wanted to create houses that had more character and more light than the usual developer-led terraced boxes, which have no light and where the kitchen is buried.'</p> <p>Slo homes have recently come up for sale in the South Chase phase of the Newhall development at Harlow, Essex, a 30-minute train journey from London. It is a development that is pushing the envelope in terms of building sustainable communities and eco-awareness - and clearly in tune with the beliefs of the Slo pioneers.</p> <p>A total of 30 two-, three- and four-bedroom Slo homes are being built, with prices starting at \u00a3269,000 for two-beds and \u00a3355,000 for three-beds, with four-beds from \u00a3399,000. The first thing you see on entering is a large wooden staircase in the centre of the ground floor. A large triangular space beneath is used as a breakfast bar, with shelving and appliances below. There is a lot of light - courtesy of double-height ceilings and floor-to-ceiling windows in the bedrooms and hallways. Covered courtyards encourage the use of outside space. </p> <p>This is not the sort of derivative new-build you normally find at the more affordable end of the market - and the way the houses are built is new too, using a technique inspired by Japanese car-production methods. The houses are built off-site, complete with fitted kitchens and bathrooms, and then transported to the development and lowered into position. This keeps water and building waste to a minimum (just 10 per cent of the waste produced by normal construction methods), energy use is low and the sound insulation is good. The construction time is 40 per cent shorter than traditional methods - and it's cheaper too. The new Slo homes get three stars (out of six) under the new Code for Sustainable Homes, a government initiative to achieve zero-carbon homes by 2016. </p> <p>'This project is very architect-led,' says Matthews. 'You wouldn't get your Taylor Wimpeys or your other large developers doing this. Over the past 30 years architects have been pushed to the margins - in this development architects have been put back in the driving seat. It takes a special developer to take this on because it's raising the game. A lot of developers just want to develop for the lowest common denominator. Here we've got thatched roofs, lots of green areas and trees in the middle of the road to slow traffic.'</p> <p>The Moen brothers, Jon and William, who are developing the land, having inherited it in the Eighties, have a clear admiration for architects - they have employed seven firms at different stages of the project, demonstrating a determination to create a development with soul. 'We treat property development responsibly and with a respect for the locale,' says Jon Moen. 'We've taken a long-term view, looking at how we can protect the environment and the wellbeing of our buyers. Every property will have a view of greenery and will be no more than 60 metres from a green space. We want generations of buyers to enjoy living here.'</p> <p>Selling in the current market is a challenge, but the sales manager at Newhall confirms that while inquiries are down, buyers seem to be serious. A case of slowly but surely, they hope.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>For further information on Slo homes, call 01279 416660 or visit the website at <a href=\"http://www.sloliving.co.uk\">sloliving.co.uk</a>.

  "<p>Union leaders will meet Ford management tomorrow in an attempt to guarantee the jobs of 1,100 workers at the US car giant's Southampton Transit van plant.</p> <p>Fears are growing that the factory will be closed if Ford decides to build a new model of the van at its low-cost sites in Turkey or Romania. A decision on where to build the new model - with production slated to begin in 2010 - is due soon. The Southampton plant is Ford's last vehicle assembly plant left in the UK.</p> <p>Roger Madison, national automotive officer for the Unite union, representing workers at the Southampton meeting, said all UK car manufacturers were looking to cut production. Jaguar and Land-Rover - recently bought by Indian firm Tata from Ford - has recently cut the number of production shifts, as has Japanese car maker Toyota at its Derbyshire plant. 'All the companies are struggling - everyone is in the same boat,' Madison said. Global car sales have fallen on the back of the economic slowdown and rising fuel prices. </p> <p>Ford has been scaling back its overseas operations in a bid to stem its losses and save the US rump of the company. In July, the Detroit-based giant reported second-quarter losses of $8.7bn as SUV (sports utility vehicle) and pick-up truck sales slumped. It had forecast that it would start making a profit next year, but this target has been scrapped following the drop in demand.</p> <p>In addition to selling Jaguar and Land-Rover, Ford also ditched Aston Martin last year. Swedish subsidiary Volvo, which it had considered offloading, is Ford's last remaining 'foreign' brand.</p>",
  "<p>Limiting or reducing global livestock numbers may be sensible but cutting demand for meat is not ('<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/07/food.meat\">Is our taste for Sunday roast killing the planet?</a>' News, last week). It will turn cattle into cat food, result in abandoned hill farms and agricultural land being switched to non-food uses while rainforests will still vanish for other Western luxuries; land usage is about money. Such a change needs investment in farming, more conservation and a short-term increase in meat consumption from such animals, then a later fall.</p> <p>There are alternatives. Silvaculture (eg pigs in woodland, sheep in orchards) and game ranching can combine habitat conservation, food production and carbon sinks while feed changes can dramatically cut emissions and waste.</p> <p>Support and funding for habitat conservation and better food supplies are what matter; we all have our preferences, but 'Eat this, not that or less of the other' is the wrong way round.<br><strong>Iain Climie</strong><br>Whitchurch, Hampshire</p> <p>The argument that the UK's uplands will become 'barren' if not grazed is as flawed as the statement that 90 per cent of all species live in rainforests. Ungrazed heather does eventually become overgrown and 'senile', but this leads to the opening up of patches of ground that become colonised by other plant and then tree species, eventually leading to more natural communities, such as rowan, ash and acid oak woodlands.

But there is danger of over-simplifying this message.</p> <p>Grazing animals are converting something humans can't eat (grass) into something we can (meat and dairy products). Meat and dairy products from grass-fed animals contain more beneficial nutrients and contain healthier fat, and grazing animals help preserve some of the most beautiful and highly valued landscapes in Britain. Most important, grazing animals protect some of the most significant carbon stores: permanent grassland and heather moorland. We should view these areas, as we do rainforests, in terms of their ability to store carbon, and subsequently their potential to fight climate change.<br><strong>Emma Hockridge</strong><br>Policy Department, <br>Soil Association, <br>Bristol</p> <p>Distinctions must be made between intensive and extensive livestock production, with much of the latter carried out on land that is too cold, mountainous or dry for crops.

  "<p>It was your classic Patagonian road. Dead straight to the horizon, bounded on one side by a view of turquoise lakes and shimmering mountains and on the other by the infinite steppe, and with a huge dome-shaped blue sky dappled with lenticular clouds up above. This was the Ruta 40, the only link road between the airport and the village of El Chalt\u00e9n, but it was the sort of road you make movies about and a cut above the M56.</p> <p>'Shall we stop for a coffee?' asked Pablo, my local guide. 'Sure,' I said, as I also fancied an empanada (stuffed pastry) after the three-hour flight from Buenos Aires. Our driver pulled into the first place we had seen in an hour (and the last we would see for the next two hours, as it turned out). Pablo said it was the Hotel La Leona, and since it had opened way back in 1894 - when Patagonia was barely on the map - it had served as both a hotel and a wayfarers' inn. </p> <p>It was characterful as well as splendidly isolated. Two huge wooden cart-wheels lay against a flagpole in the car park and the main building, with its reddish corrugated roof, looked a bit like an estancia (ranch).</p> <p>On the wall of La Leona were dozens of old monochrome prints. They looked like your usual nostalgia-tinged decorative prints but when I got up closer I saw they were photographs of Butch Cassidy, the Sundance Kid and Butch's beautiful squeeze, Ethel Place. 'They stopped here after robbing a bank in R\u00edo Gallegos,' explained Pablo.</p> <p>We went around the walls looking at the other pictures. There was one of Francisco Moreno, the pioneering geographer who for many Argentinians is Darwin, Drake and Captain Scott rolled into one; the hotel was named after the leona, or puma, that had reportedly attacked Moreno on one of his map-making adventures in the 1870s. Beside him was a wiry mountaineer, Alberto Mar\u00eda d'Agostini, a Salesian missionary who had scaled some of Patagonia's most fearsome peaks. 'Everyone passed through here in the old days,' said Pablo. 'And it was not far from here that Robert FitzRoy sailed upriver in one of his expeditions from the Beagle.'</p> <p>It turned out La Leona was something of a crossroads in Patagonia's rich folk history. All well and good, but I had just spent three years writing a book about this very subject, so it was a bit of a blow - La Leona wasn't even on my radar. Had I missed some vital reference point on the cultural map?</p> <p>Not really, because, if you spend any time at all in the great triangle of wilderness, glaciers, cold rainforest and icy peaks at the bottom of the Americas, you are bound to stumble upon the memories of conquistadors, sailors, adventurers and travel writers. After all, before the Panama canal and aeroplanes, both southern Argentina and southern Chile were stopovers on global shipping lines and, with or without the traders, Patagonia has always attracted vagrants and miscreants. That evening, we were staying in the village of El Chalt\u00e9n, which takes its name from a nearby mountain; the word is native Tehuelche for 'smoking mountain' in reference to the clouds of snow that whirl around its summit, and which the Indians may have thought were volcanic plumes.</p> <p>The common room of our grand ranch-style hotel, Los Cerros, was full of dream-inducing books. There were history tomes, collections of indigenous myths, worthy ecology-focused essays, Darwin's Voyage of the Beagle and, of course, Bruce Chatwin's seminal travelogue In Patagonia</p> <p>Back in the 1970s, Chatwin and Paul Theroux had found common ground - and literary success - in a writerly notion of Patagonia. Speaking for both of them, Chatwin once remarked: 'A literary reference or connection is likely to excite us as much as a rare animal or plant.' He idealised Patagonia as a place where you could hide away in 'the final capes of exile' - an escape from modernity and a refuge from war (in the late 1970s many writers were obsessed with the idea of living in lands beyond the threat of nuclear conflict).</p> <p>There were also gorgeous coffee-table books full of sweeping landscapes and handsome, well-scrubbed gauchos, the iconic cowboys of Argentina. With a glass of Patagonian white in my hand and a fire crackling in the hearth, I could have stayed up all night turning the pages.</p> <p>You could get lazy, and fat, in Patagonia. Fortunately, the other side of the experience is anything but sedentary. The next day Pablo took me on a tough trek up through rugged foothills covered in beech forest to get to what he promised would be a photogenic view of the higher mountains. As well as El Chalt\u00e9n - at 3,405m indisputably the mother mountain - there are several other peaks and pinnacles clustered around the same granite massif. Some take the names of local heroes, including the Poincenot Needle, dedicated to an Alpinist who died in a fall from the mountain, and the Saint-Ex\u00fapery Needle, for the famed aviator who introduced a flying postal service to Patagonia in the late 1920s. Moreno actually re-baptised Chalt\u00e9n as Fitz Roy in 1877 but for many locals the name hasn't stuck - they prefer the Indian name; and, of course, Moreno has his own peak nearby.</p> <p>Sadly, as we went up the clouds came down and by the time we had reached a ridge high enough to get a photograph, a snowstorm blocked the view, whichever direction we looked in. We picnicked on venison sandwiches and apples, and began the trek down. A perfect close-up sighting of a magellanic woodpecker - with its vermilion head thrashing away on a tree-trunk - made up for the earlier white-out. </p> <p>In the evening we had oaky malbec wines from northern Patagonia and a rack of lamb - Patagonian lamb is like truffle on the bone - while looking out of the windows of Los Cerros at a full-scale blizzard. It seemed to have come from nowhere and I remembered the records of FitzRoy when sailing south and how williwaws - hurricanes that come blasting down mountainsides - would suddenly appear in the valleys of Tierra del Fuego and whip down the channels, blowing the surveying boats off course and even causing the Beagle, a 235-tonne brig-sloop, to teeter dangerously on the waves. </p> <p>The next day we travelled south, stopping again at La Leona for coffee and cake. The latter was filled with a local fruit, calafate (a sort of barberry), which tasted sharp and rather tart. Local guides in Patagonia can't resist repeating the myth about it and Pablo was no exception. </p> <p>'An ancient Tehuelche story explains that the calafate bush grew to feed a bird that had decided not to migrate one winter,' he said, between bites of cake and sips of hot tea. 'It was the bird's tasty reward for staying. They say all travellers that eat it will come back to Patagonia one day.' </p> <p>Then we were back on the Ruta 40, which connects El Chalt\u00e9n with our destination, El Calafate, and with the northern and southern extremes of Argentina.The Ruta 40 is the Route 66 of Argentina, loved for its potholes, meandering bends and its sheer length - 5,028km -from the high plains of northern Argentina to the Strait of Magellan. But what lies on each side of the black top - forget hard-shoulders - is what makes the Ruta 40 so special. </p> <p>It always surprises people when they are told that Patagonia is the world's third-biggest desert, after the Sahara and the Gobi. It doesn't look like traditional desert but the vast steppe is dry, barren and bare, in its way. Out of the car window, I could see the scrub of tough grasses, sturdy little bushes barely moving despite the incessant and forceful westerlies and not a single tree between me and the horizon. The Ruta 40 is a comfort zone in this bleak terrain, giving you a taste of the end of the world, but with the option of driving on to the next cosy town.</p> <p>Only a few animals are attuned to such an environment. We saw armadillos and skunks on the roadside, troops of lesser rhea - the South American ostrich - hurtling across the plain and, up above, condors wheeling and watching for roadkill. As we drew close to El Calafate I saw a guanaco standing proud on top of a small hill - another native, and far more beautiful than his northern cousins, the llama and vicu\u00f1a.</p> <p>I went trekking on the Perito Moreno glacier the following morning. It was as exhilarating as it sounds, but it was especially wonderful after days of rock and barren plain. My eyes soaked up the blue ice and turquoise lagoons that form in the shallow dips on top of the glacier, and, once I got used to the crampons, it felt safe and solid, notwithstanding the groans of ice shifting below.</p> <p>On our drive back to El Calafate, I asked Pablo to stop so I could photograph a handsome old gaucho gent riding through the fields, casually rounding up some merino sheep. It was an iconic view - a man in a beret on a horse with a dog, with the Moreno glacier and Andean peaks in the background - and made up for missing the mountainscape at El Chalt\u00e9n.</p> <p>Many of the estancias along the south side of Lago Roca have been given the boutique makeover and turned into comfortable hotels; Argentinians do rustic chic better than most people and I would opt for a country sojourn over an ordinary town hotel in El Calafate any day. But just behind us was a real working sheep ranch, La Anita. I knew something of the story about the ranch and asked Pablo to take me to the monument that commemorated the tragic events that had unfolded there.</p> <p>Obscured by high grass and generally unsignposted was a small plaque bearing the legend: 'If there is a history written by the winners, that means there is another history.' In 1921, the local government, acting on behalf of rich landowners (many of them British expats) had massacred between 1,500 and 3,000 ranch workers who had protested at the miserable quasi-feudal terms of their employment. Branded anarchists, they were rounded up and summarily executed by henchmen sent from Buenos Aires.</p> <p>Just west of La Anita is the ultra-posh Alta Vista hotel, owned by the same family that is alleged to have perpetrated the murderous campaign against the underpaid gauchos. In 1974, anti-establishment director H\u00e9ctor Olivera had made a movie about the rebellion, La Patagonia Rebelde, picking up the Silver Bear at the Berlin Film Festival the same year.</p> <p>Again, in the middle of the wilderness, history and art had intertwined. What a different kind of literary travel this is to the English version, which revolves around visiting writers' sterile houses or ruins where poems were penned. In Patagonia, as well as the extreme beauty of the landscape, there is still plenty of space to think, and reflect, and conjure up your own ideas. </p> <p>Perhaps Patagonia's intrinsic poetry touches everyone. I asked Pablo to give me his definition of the region, hinting that if it was any good I would use it as an epigraph. He thought for a moment and delivered his verdict: 'For visitors, Patagonia was first regarded as an obstacle, then it became a resource and it is now an escenario - a backdrop, scenery, a kind of theatre.'</p> <p>Not bad is it? Tour guides are often very bright, but this was an accurate as well as a clever resum\u00e9 of the Patagonia that I had travelled round and written about. Conquest, plundering and playing, that's what Pablo was referring to, and modern-day travellers do a bit of each, hopefully with the emphasis on the last - well, at least when they can drag themselves away from the library and the dining room.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Chris Moss is the author of Patagonia: A Cultural History, published by Signal Books (\u00a312.99).

See <a href=\"http://www.canninghouse.com/content/events\">www.canninghouse.com/content/events</a></p> <h2>Patagonia: How to get there and when to go</h2> <p>Mostly located in Argentina and partly in Chile, Patagonia is made up of plateaux and plains to the east and the Andes to the west and south. </p> <p>To visit Chilean Patagonia, the most common route to take is firstly to fly from Santiago to Punta Arenas (four hours) and then to travel on to Torres Del Paine National Park, via Puerto Natales by road, which is a further five-hour journey. </p> <p>From Torres Del Paine, there is a road that runs to El Calafate in Argentina. You can catch a bus to take you along this stretch and that takes about another six hours. </p> <p>If you are just visiting Argentinian Patagonia, the most common route is to fly to El Calafate from Buenos Aires (around three hours). The Perito Moreno Glacier, in the southern part of Los Glaciares National Park, is the main draw in the region, a short drive from El Calafate. </p> <p>From El Calafate, there is another seven-hour bus journey to get to the village of El Chalt\u00e9n, the base for exploring the Monte Fitz Roy Massif at the northern end of the park, another highlight. </p> <p>It's not difficult to travel independently, booking your flights and tours once you arrive there, but accommodation in the parks is limited and tends to get booked up quickly in the popular summer season, from October to March. </p> <p>Alternatively, specialist operators such as Journey Latin America (0208 747 8315; <a href=\"http://www.journeylatinamerica.co.uk\">journeylatinamerica.co.uk</a>) will tailor-make an itinerary with options, including walking on glaciers with crampons and trekking. </p> <p>Although most people visit in the summer when it's considered warmer, glacial winds can make it feel very cold.

  "<p>Webvan, Boo, Pets.com. Remember them? Long-dead dotcom companies that illustrate the rags-to-riches - and back to rags - tales of the first cyber-boom.</p> <p>But unlike hundreds of other first-wave internet companies, Lastminute.com is still here, and this year marks a decade in business. The anniversary comes at a time when the travel sector is braced for enforced consolidation after a series of high-profile airline and tour operator failures, including XL Leisure, Britain's third largest package tour operator. So how has Lastminute made it in this brutally competitive sector? </p> <p>'The difference between Lastminute.com and the dotcom firms that didn't make it is that it was actually a good idea and a sustainable business,' says Lastminute.com's chief executive, Ian McCaig. 'At the time, it was possible to raise money for the unlikeliest projects but when I look back at the original business plan, it is not fluff.'</p> <p>For many, Lastminute.com is forever associated with its founders, Brent Hoberman and Martha Lane Fox, who became pin-ups for the e-generation. The premise was simple: to use the then-new internet to sell 'distressed inventory' such as holidays and theatre tickets. The young, good-looking pair generated reams of free PR and a high profile, and the 'Brent and Martha show' was a key ingredient of Lastminute.com's wildly successful flotation in 2000, which saw the company achieve a market capitalisation of \u00a3400m.</p> <p>'We had a very singular birth - as dotcom was taking off - and two very charismatic and youthful founders,' says McCaig. 'Lastminute.com was born into a much hyped sector, topping it by doing its IPO the day before the dotcom crash.'</p> <p>However, the duo got a rougher ride from the press as disillusioned investors watched their investments plummet. Hoberman and Lane Fox carried on regardless, expanding into Europe and embarking on a series of acquisitions. Intelligently, they populated the board with individuals experienced in the travel, technology and retail sectors; McCaig, a former IT and telecoms executive, joined it as chief operating officer in 2003.</p> <p>Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and the number of websites trying to address the same market has proliferated. Lastminute.com can no longer differentiate itself on price from rivals such as Expedia and eBookers, and exclusive content is hard to come by. Without the cachet of Hoberman and Lane Fox, what makes Lastminute.com different? </p> <p>'I believe no one else offers what we offer,' says McCaig. 'In the UK, the brand has transcended its literal meaning with people regarding it as a leisure brand.'</p> <p>Didn't its squeaky-clean founders start to get on his nerves? That couldn't be further from the truth, says McCaig, as he lists his friends' many good qualities. He says Hoberman has an 'intellectual ego but is not arrogant', and they speak regularly, having forged a close working relationship in the two years leading up to the business's sale to Sabre Holdings, the owner of online travel shop Travelocity, in 2005.</p> <p>Some things had to change - such as the wallpaper in Lastminute.com's boardroom in London's Victoria. An interior design contact of Hoberman's wife Genevieve had decorated the meeting room in black paper with silver circles the size of 10p pieces. It became a DIY emergency when a colleague emailed McCaig asking to be excused board meetings as he feared the colour scheme was triggering his epilepsy.</p> <p>'We had to move on from that period as companies can become addicted to the past,' says McCaig. 'Brands need to change - at the beginning Lastminute.com was just a London thing.' </p> <p>Its customers still tend to be savvy urbanites but they are now as likely to be based in Paris or Rome. In the two years since he took charge, McCaig has aimed to improve the technology behind the website while overseeing its integration with Travelocity's European interests. </p> <p>McCaig is pleased the company is no longer beholden to the public markets. Sabre has since been bought out by private equity firms TPG and Silver Lake Partners. Lastminute.com has a turnover in the region of \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.6bn) but McCaig refuses to be specific.</p> <p>For a new generation of internet users, who didn't grow up with the Brent and Martha story, Lastminute.com is just another brand that pops up in a Google search. Recent market surveys have suggested that Lastminute has lost ground to rivals such as Expedia and Tripadvisor.com this year. McCaig, however, bristles when the subject is raised: 'We have got scale, so I am not obsessed with market share. I am obsessed with growing profits.'</p> <p>To take the business to the next stage, McCaig wants to widen the brand's appeal, making it a kind of social secretary for its customers rather than just a travel operator. Its lifestyle business is an increasingly important part of the mix, with the company expected to sell 1 million theatre tickets this year. The core demographic remains 28-to 42-year-old city-dwellers, but key to its success will be gaining recognition as a leisure brand - as opposed to travel website - in markets beyond the UK.</p> <p>The industry's favourite cliche is that customers will give up a lot before they give up their holiday, but McCaig says the credit crunch means the sector faces tough conditions. Tour operators cut capacity this year to preserve margin and he says demand is under pressure in a lot of markets. He predicts some big-name brands will fall as the travel market polarises between a handful of global operators, such as TUI, which owns First Choice Holidays, and niche operators. McCaig wants Lastminute.com to be in the former group. 'When Lastminute.com started, it was a bit adolescent - there were great moments and some terrible ones,' says McCaig. 'We then had a period where we had to study a bit and got interested in going to university.' </p> <p>If that is the case, though, it is applying for a course with only five or six places - and competing with 10 other applicants.</p> <h2>From hagiography to hate mail - and back again</h2> <p>Lastminute.com is the UK's most famous survivor of the dotcom era. The travel and leisure website, founded by Brent Hoberman and Martha Lane Fox, is an icon of a time when the siren call of the internet saw investors write blank cheques to hordes of twentysomething cyber-entrepreneurs.</p> <p>The 'Brent and Martha show' made Lastminute.com stand out from the crowd. Hoberman was just 29 when he started the company in the living room of his London flat, and Lane Fox was 25. The well-connected pair attracted hundreds of column inches, which served to open even more doors to them. Hoberman's father worked on Wall Street while Lane Fox is the daughter of an Oxford don. So, despite running a company with a turnover no bigger than a small pub's, at the height of the cyber-goldrush the couple appeared on the cover of Business Week and their image was hung in the National Portrait Gallery.</p> <p>With spectacular timing the company floated in 2000, valued at \u00a3400m: even as the champagne corks were popping, the technology bubble burst - a correction that saw billions of pounds wiped off technology stocks. Denied any honeymoon with its investors, it embarked on five turbulent years as a listed company. Hate mail replaced hagiographies as the company's share price collapsed.</p> <p>However, Hoberman and Lane Fox began a workmanlike global assault, launching sister websites in mainland Europe before expanding further afield and acquiring rivals such as Online Travel.</p> <p>Lane Fox stepped down as managing director in 2003 after the share price had recovered, remaining a non-executive until 2005 when the company was sold to Travelocity owner Sabre Holdings for \u00a3577m. Hoberman stayed for another year but now devotes himself to new interiors website Mydeco. However, the pair haven't let go entirely: Hoberman speaks regularly to chief executive Ian McCaig, who in turn asks Lane Fox to vet new executive appointments.</p>",
  "<p>The Labour party has traditionally been frightened of the financial markets, often with good reason. Gordon Brown has been obsessively wary of the Conservative party, often with less reason. It was through fear of the financial markets that Brown handed control of official interest rates to the Bank of England. Oddly enough, the Attlee government nationalised the Bank in 1946 out of fearful memories of what the financial markets had done to Labour in 1929-31. It's a funny old world.</p> <p>Putting monetary policy in the hands of non-political technicians was deemed necessary so that New Labour's baggage train of revisionist policies would not be derailed by the financial highwaymen of the City of London or by the broader financial world. Well, here we are on the verge of autumn 2008, and Gordon Brown's government finds itself in deep trouble not least because, by trying to outflank the Conservatives from the right (the 10p tax fiasco, identity cards, plans for 42 days' detention without trial), it has alienated its core vote while achieving the seemingly impossible in making the Conservatives claim to be the more caring party. </p> <p>Depressed Labour supporters in general, and Brown in particular, could take heart from two refreshing contributions to the debate by those great foot soldiers of the moderate left, the Fabians. In an article in Renewal, Sunder Katwala, general-secretary of the Fabian Society, argues: 'Labour's mission is greater equality. It must again be the fairness party, or it is nothing.' </p> <p>In a world where memories are often short, Katwala reminds his fellow Labour party members that New Labour was not just the work of Blair and Brown: the ground had been prepared by Neil Kinnock, John Smith and others. Indeed, way back in the Nuffield General Election Study of 1992, David Butler and Dennis Kavanagh identified some of New Labour's characteristics - its emphasis on 'skills training, new ways of working, improved public services, greater rights for women and families, and protection of the environment' some two years before the Granita Deal between Blair and Brown. </p> <p>Katwala acknowledges that renewing Labour's claim to fairness will be difficult after the 10p tax episode. 'Nobody will stand against fairness, least of all David Cameron's shiny new Conservatism.' He adds: 'The disagreement between the parties is primarily about the role and responsibility of government... Cameron's claim to be the true 'progressive' is founded on his claim that Conservatives know that it is not the state's job to act on the important progressive causes of social inequality, climate change or international development ... Labour's argument must be the opposite: \"fairness doesn't happen by chance\".' </p> <p>Tim Horton, the Fabian research director, takes up the baton with a searching analysis of the Conservatives' plans for public spending. Looking beneath the sheep's clothing in which George Osborne's recent statements have been draped, Horton notes that 'sharing the proceeds of growth' means cutting tax and public spending at a time - the next 10 to 20 years - when demographic factors (a growing and ageing population) will mean that public spending will need to be increased merely to maintain standards which many people regard as barely adequate at the present. New Labour is in danger of allowing the debate to centre on managerial competence but there is a profound division between the parties on desirable levels of public spending.</p> <p>As Katwala notes, 'the credit crunch has shown how citizens look to government to provide stability and insure them against the worst risks ... voters should decide whether more free childcare and safer streets would be better for them than tax cuts.'</p> <p>Which brings us back to the financial markets. Perhaps the appropriate question at present is not how to share the proceeds of growth, but how to share the proceeds of recession. A healthy debate has opened up about the ethics of a financial and banking culture in which the participants think they are entitled to vast salaries and huge bonuses whether they are making or losing money for their clients. </p> <p>New Labour had an exaggerated respect for the financial markets - a respect that these days is not even shared by the governor of the Bank of England. The fallout from the credit crunch may yet prove that the Chancellor of the Exchequer was right to be so pessimistic in public. The understandable interest in the US presidential election may have distracted people from the hugely significant US government bail-out of the US financial institutions Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. The bailers-out had to be bailed out!</p> <p>The collapse of the modern banking model, one of whose central fallacies was the belief that by spreading risk you could eliminate it, has indeed produced the biggest financial crisis for many decades. This does not yet merit being categorised as the biggest economic crisis for 60 years, and the very move towards recession is itself easing 'stagflationary' fears and raising the prospect of cuts in interest rates at some stage. But the idea that, after what it has produced, the financial sector does not need better regulation is for the birds. As Hannes Androsch, former finance minister and vice-chancellor of Austria, says in the summer issue of Europe's World: 'Like technological innovation, financial regulation is concerned with cost reduction; in this case the cost of transferring funds from savers to investors ... But where financial innovation is designed to circumvent regulation, either prudential or taxation, we need to be much more circumspect.'</p>",
  "<p>One in six mothers has a favourite child - but would never admit to it, according to a survey by Netmums, one of the most popular parenting websites in the UK.</p> <p>More than 1,000 mothers responded to the survey, with 16 per cent admitting that they love one child more than the others. One third said that they love their children in exactly the same way, while just over half said they love their children differently - but equally.</p> <p>'I do have a favourite child: my second youngest and my last daughter,' admitted Polly, a mother of four. 'It's almost like a secret love affair. When she walks into a room with my other children, she stands out to me more than the rest. I would die for all my kids, but I have to admit I would fight more strongly and fiercely for her.'</p> <p>Polly said: 'It feels like I'm betraying my other wonderful children and the impact on them could be potentially devastating. But I strongly believe that most parents do have a favourite child but are reluctant to admit it. Most parents recoil in horror at the thought of admitting this, and spend a lot of time and worry suppressing their feelings. I have come to private terms with the fact that I am going to have to continue - like most other parents - to live in denial.'</p> <p>Jodie Hill, also a mother of four who lives in Newcastle upon Tyne, favours her daughter. </p> <p>'My mother-in-law and I have argued about it, but my feelings are too overpowering to deny. I can't deny that my daughter is my favourite,' she said. 'There are reasons for it. I had always wanted a girl but had three sons. Then I got pregnant by mistake and almost had a termination. </p> <p>'I thought I was hiding my preference, but after my mother-in-law stepped in and challenged me, I've tried to control my behaviour,' she said. 'I no longer spoil my daughter and not my sons, and I try to spend extra time with the boys alone, to get closer to them.'</p> <p>There is very little research into favouritism. This, said Christine Duff, a member of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy and a Netmums online Parent Supporter, is a result of the level of taboo that the issue holds in society.</p> <p>'Sadly I hear this all the time,' she said. 'It is something which causes women intense shame and guilt. Mothers need to know that it is not uncommon to struggle to bond with one or more children and that it can be worked on.'</p> <p>Duff said that many women find it hardest to bond with their eldest child, a feeling which could stem from the difficulty of being a first-time mother.</p> <p>However, there are exceptions, she said, many of which have very little to do with the children themselves.</p> <p>'I have found that often those mothers who have told me that they love one child over another also very often report dissatisfaction with how their relationship with their partners has changed,' she said. 'It often seems to me to be about unrealistic expectations of life, love, motherhood and themselves, all combined with an overly harsh self-judgment.' </p> <p>Justine Roberts, the co-founder of Mumsnet, another parenting website, said that mothers feel so ashamed of having a favourite child that they are often unable to even address the issue in an anonymous online environment.</p> <p>'Parents are really concerned, and rightly so, of loving one child more than the other, but I'm sure it's really common,' she added. 'It's entirely natural, after all - some children are easier to love because they're more likeable, they cause less anxiety and they make your life easier. But feeling that way it doesn't have to mean you treat your children differently. </p> <p>'It's a shame there isn't more help and advice out there for parents in this situation, but it's understandable. People are very cautious for very good reasons. You can't exactly buy a book about this issue and leave it lying around the house.'</p> <p>However, according to Dr Martina Klett-Davies, who is a sociologist who specialises in families and sibling relationships, favouritism can have the counterintuitive impact of harming the preferred child while helping their siblings.</p> <p>'If there is a favourite child, they probably become too spoiled and find it difficult in later life,' she said. 'But the imbalance could prepare siblings for unfairness in later life when you leave the family circle by teaching them to be fighters.'</p> <h2>Please tell me it's not abnormal</h2> <p>It was the feeling that she was breaking the ultimate parenting taboo that caused Hazel Smith, of Liverpool, most distress when she realised she favoured the younger of her two sons. </p> <p>'I admit these feelings to my partner, but would feel too ashamed to talk about it with my friends. I tried speaking to the child health visitor, but she dismissed it as post-natal depression, which I know it is not.</p> <p>'Having a favourite is the worst emotion you can feel as a parent. There's no advice around for parents going through this. I have read child development books and watched television programmes about parenting, but they don't talk about it. That makes me feel even more abnormal.'</p>",
  "<p>Bear Sterns and Lehman - two down, who will be next to go? Dick Fuld, the pugnacious chief executive of Lehman Brothers, was not the only one who thought the investment bank would be able to weather the storm. The support package under which the Treasury is committed to providing liquidity to the market, introduced following the collapse of Bear Stearns, was supposed to stop a repeat of that. And the big banks dubbed 'friends of Lehman' - including Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and JP Morgan - were all keen to confirm they were happy dealing with the bank on Tuesday, despite the plunge in its share price as talks with potential saviour Korean Development Bank broke down.</p> <p>A day later, a swingeing third-quarter loss and a poorly received restructuring programme, involving partial sales and promised spin-offs, changed all that. Even rival bulge-bracket support was not enough to stop its shares falling virtually to penny share status, having lost 90 per cent of their value in a week as investors calculated that Fuld, a veteran of at least three previous crises, was not be going to be able to trade the bank out of this one.</p> <p>The smart money is betting that Bank of America, as the next strongest bank after Bear Stearns' saviour, JP Morgan, will be strong-armed by the US Federal Reserve into rescuing Lehman. It will be backed by Chinese money and financial specialist J C Flowers. That is not only likely to mean the departure of Fuld; it will also mean yet more bad news for its 26,200 employees, who between them own almost 40 per cent of the bank. Many of them will now find themselves out of a job, as well as holding virtually worthless stock. </p> <p>It will be an ignominious end for Fuld, until now one of the most respected bosses on Wall Street. While his reputation is still much higher than Bear Stearns boss Jimmy Cayne - who was playing bridge as the bank crumbled - like him, Fuld stands guilty of holding out against selling off the bank's assets and, when that became the only option, of holding out for prices more appropriate to the boom years than a financial crisis. </p> <p>Like giant mortgage lenders Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, which were bailed out by the government last weekend, Lehman is deemed to be too big, and too important, to fail. But how far can the Treasury's largesse extend? Will Washington Mutual, whose shares also plunged on liquidity fears last week, also be bailed out? And what if the next weakest investment bank, universally deemed to be Merrill Lynch, should also find itself in the firing line?</p> <p>The extent of Treasury support was one of the biggest uncertainties hanging over Lehman, according to banking analysts at brokerage Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods. 'Can and will Treasury Secretary [Hank] Paulson help?... or will he feel the need to make a statement that there are limits to what they will do? We don't think we have to be concerned with whether the government will need to get involved in the near term, but we do believe the question of whether they would in fact get involved down the road is up for debate,' asked KBW analyst Lauren Smith in a note. She was also sceptical about the chances of Fuld's restructuring package working.</p> <p>Dubbed 'good bank, bad bank', Lehman is trying to shift some of the more risky assets off its own balance sheet. Blackrock, the fund manager, has already agreed to buy $4bn of its $17.2bn portfolio of residential mortgages in a deal which should be completed within the next few weeks. It is also working on spinning off $25bn-$30bn of its property assets into a separate company, to be called REI Global, although this is unlikely to be completed until next year. </p> <p>It hoped to raise the cash needed to back this new company, and to bolster its shattered balance sheet, by selling 55 per cent of its much-prized investment management business, Neuberger Berman. Analysts estimate this could raise $3bn-$4bn - but the need for speed means that the most likely buyers are private equity firms, rather than rivals. It is believed that initial bids were due in last Friday, with KKR, Bain Capital and Hellman &amp; Friedman among those submitting offers, and that the sale should be agreed next month.</p> <p>But the real question is whether that would be enough to restore the bank's fortunes. Smith said in a note that, while the proposals were positive, there were 'a number of unanswered questions about whether these actions will be enough for Lehman to recover from this crisis'. Among the uncertainties are whether the property market will be robust enough to allow REI to be floated without any further write-downs on its assets, and whether 'recent events have ... impaired the core client franchise and ... counterparties will continue to do business with them'.</p> <p>Fuld was at his pugnacious best when he presented the proposals along with its third-quarter figures on Wednesday: 'We have been through adversity before and we always come out a lot stronger.' </p> <p>But the proposals always had the air of a company clearing the decks to attract a bidder. The problem is that any willing buyer would surely have shown itself already; and the credit crunch means that the list of banks able, never mind willing, to do that shrinks daily. HSBC, still one of the strongest, is keen to expand in investment banking; but its history suggests that will be done organically rather than buying an investment bank, and particularly one as troubled as Lehman. Royal Bank of Scotland may find Lehman's business attractive but has plenty of problems with its own, not to mention integrating ABN Amro. The Canadian banks, which are often touted as saviours, are also likely to find raising the funds rather too expensive.</p> <p>While the Korean Development Bank, which exacerbated the crisis after it withdrew from discussions about taking a stake, had the money and the willingness, Fuld stands accused by one analyst of scaring them off by playing hardball - asking too high a price and tying it up with onerous terms and conditions. </p> <p>And there was considerable disappointment among investors that, not only was the $3.9bn loss far worse that had been expected, the Lehman proposals were all promises of action, rather than actual deals. Any buyers of the asset management business would still have to find their own finance, and who can bet what the stock and property markets will be like when the REI flotation finally takes place? And the inevitable question is: was Blackrock taking the best of the residential mortgages, leaving the need for yet more writedowns on the remaining book? </p> <p>Fuld has plenty of experience of getting Lehman out of crises. When he took over as chief executive 15 years ago, the bank had just endured nine years of ownership by American Express, a period riven with power struggles and dissent within the investment banking ranks. Fuld steered it through a flotation only to be faced with a savage bear market in its core business of trading fixed-income products, and the collapse of Long Term Capital Management, before successfully rebuilding the firm. </p> <p>The results looked pretty impressive: in the five years to 2007, its net revenues doubled to $19.3bn and its net income jumped from $1.7bn to $4.2bn. But the financial crisis has wiped out much of those gains: in the past two quarters alone, it has lost more than $6.7bn and, with the boom days of the mid-Nineties now little more than a distant memory, the glory days of 2006 and 2007 are likely to acquire the same nostalgia value.</p> <p>The bank is putting a brave face on the sale of a stake in Neuberger, pointing out that it is retaining some of the more lucrative parts of fund management - including its institutional distribution business and its hedge funds (whose recent losses would have made them hard to sell in any case). It adds that the impact on its results would be small, but it is undoubtedly a blow to Fuld. Bought for $2.6bn just five years ago, the business is widely regarded as a jewel in Lehman's crown which, in anything other than a fire sale, would be expected to attract interest from a range of rival fund managers.</p> <p>One analyst, who declined to be named, said that the need to ditch it quickly to raise money was a symptom of Fuld's arrogant conviction that he could manage this crisis in the same way as he had previous crises in his career. He is said to have tried to impose restrictions on the fund management sale, such as an option to buy it back at some future date, while he is also accused of arrogance, and asking too high a price, in his dealings with the Koreans.</p> <p>'He has not realised how much the climate has changed,' the analyst said.</p> <p>Fuld claims that he is always open to offers: he told investors on Wednesday: 'If anyone comes up with an attractive proposition that made compelling shareholder value, I would put it to the board.'</p> <h2>Lehman's history</h2> <p><strong>1850</strong> Founded by Jewish immigrants Henry, Emanuel and Mayer Lehman</p> <p><strong>1984</strong> Acquired by American Express for $360m. Culture clashes mean the deal never works</p> <p><strong>1994</strong> Fuld leads initial public offering to take the group public again</p> <p><strong>1997 </strong>Long Term Capital Management collapse threatens Lehman's survival but Fuld steers it through </p> <p><strong>2008</strong> More than $15bn of writedown and credit losses threaten survival again</p> <h2>Bank of America: Ready to pounce</h2> <p>Ken Lewis, the larger-than-life head of Bank of America, is nothing if not opportunistic. Most chief executives would think that integrating one acquisition was enough, but Lewis is already integrating two and appears willing to contemplate taking on a third. It is less than two years ago that Bank of America snatched the LaSalle banking chain out of the ABN Amro empire, right from under the nose of Royal Bank of Scotland. </p> <p>That was quickly followed by the takeover of Countrywide Financial, the mortgage lender heavily embroiled in the US sub-prime mess. Yet BoA is still deemed robust enough by the Federal Reserve to be one of the prime candidates to take on the challenge of getting Lehman back on an even keel. That is despite Lewis insisting that he was not interested in investment banking because he could not work out how to make money there.</p> <p>Dick Bove, banking analyst with Ladenburg Thalmann, thinks it should be able to make plenty from the deal, by acquiring the best fixed-income desk in the country, an excellent fund management arm and capital-markets products to sell to its 68,000 customers. Keeping Lehman together - its employees can hardly be motivated by the plunge in the value of their shareholdings and the public auction for their firm - will be Lewis's biggest challenge, if he accepts it.</p>",
  "<p>As if the prospect of a global recession isn't enough, consider the latest threat to world economic stability: an alliance between Russia and Opec, the oil-producing cartel dominated by Saudi Arabia. </p> <p>That's a scary possibility, as Russia supplies one third of Europe's energy needs, while Opec accounts for nearly 40 per cent of global oil production. Together they produce half the world's oil, so any pact that paves the way for Russia to become a full member of the cartel would present a threat to countries such as Britain, which is becoming increasingly dependent on foreign imports as supplies of North Sea oil dry up.</p> <p>Don't be under any illusion that an Opec-Russia tie-up would act responsibly by striking a fair balance between the amount charged by producers and the price paid by consumer nations in Europe, America and Asia. </p> <p>Take Russia's behaviour, for example. Three months ago, Gazprom chairman Alexei Miller, in a display of naked self-interest, suggested that the price of oil could soar to $250 a barrel, at a time when the price had already leapt 39 per cent in 2008 to almost $140.</p> <p>But is such a merger really on the cards? The Russians would clearly like one: last week, it sent its energy minister Igor Sechin to attend Opec's meeting in Vienna and proposed 'extensive co-operation' with the cartel. A memorandum of understanding is being prepared for signature in the coming months.</p> <p>An alliance would be a boon for the Kremlin, which has already demonstrated in Ukraine and elsewhere that it is prepared to use oil as a political weapon in order to re-establish its influence over the former Soviet empire.</p> <p>Oil is Russia's biggest bargaining chip, as the soaraway price has done more than anything else to give it the confidence and clout to re-assert itself on the world stage. A pact with Opec would strengthen Moscow at a time when it has lost friends in the West following its invasion of Georgia and its harassment of foreign companies, such as BP, which have business interests in Russia.</p> <p>An extension of the oil cartel to include Russia, however, will be hard to pull off. Saudi Arabia, by far the most important Opec member, is a conservative state supposedly aligned with the United States, and may be reluctant to alienate such a powerful ally. But it is not impossible: Opec already comprises countries hostile to the US, notably Iran and Venezuela. So why not add Russia?</p> <p>Hidden from the debate, however, is the fact that Saudi Arabia is a cartel within a cartel. With 21 per cent of all Middle Eastern proven oil reserves, it is the only country with significant surplus capacity. That means it can cushion itself from price falls by bumping up volume in a way that other countries can't. No doubt that was one reason why Russia has been frantically lobbying behind the scenes for Opec to cut production to keep prices high, as it faces capacity restraints and stands to lose billions in foreign reserves.</p> <p>Even without the Russians, Opec, under the sway of the powerful Saudis, is hardly a benign force that is seeking to make things easy for the West as recession looms. </p> <p>Last week, the cartel said it would cut production by around 500,000 barrels, bringing a rebuke from the International Energy Agency, which claimed the move would undermine the price relief that consumers have enjoyed in the last month. </p> <p>But Opec may have overreached itself: by trying keep the price of oil at around $100 a barrel, it has stoked fears that a recession will be deeper than anticipated and will lead to a slump in demand. As a consequence, oil closed on Friday at just under $100 a barrel and could slide further.</p> <p>But it will take a long time before Opec's influence diminishes: despite all the talk in the US about green technologies that will help the world reduce its dependence on oil, it will be decades before that happens. Opec will remain a force to be reckoned with for the foreseeable future. The Russians know this, as their action last week demonstrated all too clearly.</p> <h2>Can the fed really let Lehman die?</h2> <p>The history of Lehman Brothers parallels the growth of the United States and its energetic drive toward prosperity and international prominence.' So says the Lehman website, which charts the rise of America's fourth largest bank from its beginnings in 1850, when its wealth was derived from the cotton trade.</p> <p>Some 160 years later, Lehman's decline aptly illustrates an erosion of US power and prestige as the world's largest economy grapples with the second year of the credit crunch.</p> <p>Many of the country's biggest financial institutions have been rescued by foreign investors and, as we are constantly reminded, the balance of economic power is shifting east.</p> <p>It would be foolish, of course, to write off America, the first economy to be hit by the credit crunch and, doubtless, the first to recover.</p> <p>But the fading fortunes of Lehman demonstrate the continuing fragility of financial markets and show just how quickly confidence can evaporate. Bear Stearns suffered a similar fate in April but, to be fair, Lehman is in a different league with valuable assets and a less risky business model. The reason that Lehman is done for is twofold: the collapse of a plan last week for a capital injection from the South Koreans, and its exposure to $50bn of commercial and residential property assets, which investors fear may have to be written down. Lehman's stock value has fallen 97 per cent in 12 months.</p> <p>Whether the US authorities will let Lehman fail or engineer a rescue takeover by Bank of America - or a consortium - remains to be seen. But it is unlikely they will provide the cash guarantees that JP Morgan enjoyed when it acquired Bear Stearns.</p> <p>Lehman is a major player, but not in the league of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, nationalised last week.</p> <p>But letting a big Wall Street bank fail is not a decision to be taken lightly. Yes, it would show that institutions can't always expect to be bailed out when they run into trouble. But the worry is that it would shake confidence in the ability of other big banks to survive and bring with it the risk of systemic financial failure.</p> <h2>Chrome may not be enough to keep Google shiny</h2> <p>Google is in the dock again: the US justice department has hired a top Washington lawyer to lead a possible anti-cartel probe into its proposed advertising tie-up with rival search engine Yahoo. </p> <p>A fortnight ago, Google released a web browser, Chrome, to challenge Microsoft's Internet Explorer, a move that could further boost its search-linked advertising operation and raise the hackles of competitors. Like all big corporations, Google has its critics who fear it will become a monopoly that will attract the attention of anti-trust regulators on both sides of the Atlantic. That day is probably further off than people think. </p> <p>More worrying, in my view, is the vast amount of personal information that Google collects about individuals that are of benefit to advertisers but potentially could be misused. </p> <p>Up to now, Google has been a benign force and has largely lived up to its motto: 'do no evil', despite a controversial move to bow to censorship in China. But for how long?</p>",
  "<p>To many Europeans, especially of a liberal bent, the emergence of Sarah Palin as one of the dominant forces in American politics is a cause for dismay.</p> <p>At first glance she seems to represent the triumph of the personal over the political. Her looks are remarked upon, her fashions critiqued. For supporters her status as a mother of five is touted as her greatest virtue. For others the Palin family is a source of sniping gossip. Her breezy, straight-talking style is hailed by admirers as a key to unlocking the vital support of the latest fad in polling demographics: Wal-Mart Moms. Others see it as a sign of a political ingenue possessing little in the way of sophistication beyond her background as a small town mayor.</p> <p>This is to overlook the substance of her beliefs. Palin represents an extreme form of conservatism. She is not just anti-abortion, she opposes abortion even in cases of rape or incest. And Palin supports the introduction of creationist ideas into the classroom, alongside evolution. She is sceptical of global warming, only recently accepting that human activities might play a role, flying in the face of vast bodies of scientific opinion - even the US government's own advisers. She is pro-drilling for oil in environmentally sensitive areas in a world that needs to wean itself away from fossil fuels. Her grasp of foreign policy is limited to a series of hawkish and naive soundbites on Russia, terrorism and Iran.</p> <p>America has had eight years of a government that has held similar views. The result has been to put ideological and emotional distance between it and large parts of Europe, Asia and Latin America. Apart from isolationist Republicans, this is bad news both for America and the rest of us. America needs a friendlier world to do economic and political business. The world needs an America more in tune with its natural friends and allies.</p> <p>The political beliefs exemplified by Palin and her fellow religious conservatives are not the answer, no matter how well presented by her considerable political skills.</p> <p>Change is the watchword of the American election. But McCain, in putting Palin on his ticket, is trying to pull off an audacious con trick. Palin does not represent change, but more of the same. And then some.</p>",

As the candidates enter this last leg of what has been a two year journey, a team from Guardian Films, investigative journalist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Ridgeway\">James Ridgeway</a> and I will begin another journey across the United States to talk to voters. We want to find out: Whither goest thou, America? And more importantly, why?</p> <p>We're still putting the finishing touches on our route, and I'll be talking about it more as it comes together. We hope to meet as many people along the way, and if you're interested in meeting us, <a href=\"mailto:kevin.anderson@guardian.co.uk\">drop me an e-mail</a>. I'll keep you posted on our plans and how you can take part. Even if we don't pass through your town or city - which is highly likely considering the size of the US - you can still join the conversation via the <a href=\"http://forum4editors.com/2008/09/us-odyssey-of-the-guardians-blogger/#more-644\">internet in ways that I'll be talking more about</a>. Until we leave, I'll be writing about the states we will visit and some of the issues.</p> <p>John <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/thefix/2008/09/mccain_manager_this_election_i.html\">McCain's campaign manager Rick Davis</a> said:</p> <blockquote> <p>This election is not about issues. This election is about a composite view of what people take away from these candidates.</p> </blockquote> <p>There is some truth in that statement. Presidential elections in the United States aren't just about the issues. How many times did the smartest kid at school become class president?</p> <p>Having said that, I'd like to find a way to talk about the issues. What are the most important issues where you live? What are your neighbours talking about? If you live outside of the United States, what issues are you paying attention to? How do you think the election will affect your country?</p> <p>Here are some of the issue that I'm watching:</p> <p><strong>1. Health Care.</strong> The issue isn't simply about making sure that the 46 million uninsured Americans have care. It's also about how the hell is the US going to pay for it? In 1960, 1 of every 20 dollars were spent on healthcare. Now, it's <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/09/AR2008090902520.html\">one in every 6</a>.<br><strong>2. National Debt.</strong> It was high enough. The Congressional Budget Office is predicting the national debt to double to more than <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0911/p01s05-usec.html\">$5 trillion in the next 10 years.</a> That's more than <a href=\"http://www.brillig.com/debt_clock/\">$31,700 for every US citizen</a>. Anyone want to add that to your credit card bill?<br><strong>3. It's the Economy stupid.</strong> Unemployment is rising and prices have risen. The US has been buoyed by exports, but as the the global economy slows, so will exports.</p> <p>The long and short of all of this is that the bills are going to come due just as the economy hits the skids around the world. Those are just some of the domestic issues that I'm watching.</p> <p>What answers do the candidates have? If you're listening to the mainstream media, all you've heard about the last week is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsOe87PcKMo\">lipstick and pigs</a>. \"The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimates that the Obama plan would cut taxes by $2.9 trillion over 2009-2018; the McCain plan would reduce taxes by nearly $4.2 trillion,\" writes <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0911/p01s05-usec.html\">Gail Russell Chaddock in the Christian Science Monitor</a>. OK, that's brilliant, but who is going to pay the bills?</p> <p>As I said, I'm interested in the issues that you're keeping an eye on whether you are a US voter (like me) or someone watching the election from abroad (also like me at the moment). It's going to be a fascinating trip, and I hope to see you on the road.</p> <p>Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/election2008,\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"techtag\">election2008,</a> <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/economy,\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"techtag\">economy,</a> <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/politics,\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"techtag\">politics,</a> <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/johnmccain,\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"techtag\">johnmccain,</a> <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/barackobama\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"techtag\">barackobama</a></p>",
  "<p>The doomsday theory says the Premier League will eat itself should the influx of overseas investors and the march of the global brand continue. The approach to Anfield this morning said we are already there.</p> <p>For at least 1,000 Liverpool supporters, and it appeared far more when they congregated next to the Kop before kick off, the biggest game in the league calendar meant another protest march and another demonstration against the unfulfilled promises and debt-ridden reality of the club's American owners. The presence of George Gillett - and to be fair to the co-owner accused of ruling in absentia, he rarely misses a home game against Manchester United - thus ensured more eyes were trained on the directors' box than Dimitar Berbatov when these hated rivals took to the field at Anfield. Whatever happened to just meeting in the pub? To the escapism and, perish the thought, the fun? It is, for many, long gone.</p> <p>Disillusionment and skewed priorities were not confined to events surrounding today's fixture, when Rafael Ben\u00edtez's side overcame an ominous start superbly through sheer force of will. At Newcastle, thousands more will stage their own protest at the reign of Mike Ashley and the presence of Denis Wise, doing a conga around St James' Park as they go, while no less an authority that Mark Hughes believes Manchester City versus Chelsea represents the grandest fixture on show on account of their respective bank-balances. Not their combined total of three league titles in the past 40 years against the 21 championships and eight European Cups that Liverpool and United can boast between them in the same period, of course, just their projected cash flows. The sad thing is so many buy into the chilling ideas of Garry Cook, City's executive chairman, and barely raise an eyebrow when Peter Kenyon, Chelsea's chief executive, leads the team up to collect their Champions League runners-up medals.</p> <p>Those who do recoil can be found on Liverpool's Breck Road and outside St James' Park today. And they will be drowned out if, or when, their club becomes awash with Arabian money and is able to talk seriously of fantasy transfers once again. Gillett at least cannot claim to be unawares of the depth of anger against himself and co-owner Tom Hicks following this weekend's protests, whether organised by the Spirit of Shankly group or otherwise.</p> <p>Gillett and his minders are believed to have had to leave a Liverpool city centre pub on Friday night amid concern for the American's safety. Either that or they left in disgust at the early drinking curfew in Ye Cracke's beer garden. We've all been there. Gillett was sat four rows back in the director's box instead of at the front and directly behind those supporters straining to catch a glimpse, and pass on their thoughts, to Liverpool's co-owner. Meanwhile, out on the pitch, an enthralling game took place.</p>",
  "<p>I've always been aware that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/feb/29/marryme\">my husband</a> works in a pretty dangerous environment, but to be honest there haven't been many occasions during his prison service career when I've had to think too hard about the scary side of his job. There was the time we walked into a pub and were confronted by an angry ex-con demanding to know why he couldn't even drink in his local without an \"effing screw\" turning up of course, and then there was the time he was called away from home to help deal with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/feb/20/ukcrime.prisonsandprobation\">riot at Strangeways</a> and wasn't able to contact me for days even to let me know he was okay; but apart from these and maybe a handful of other slightly less terrifying reminders of the risky nature of his work, I've never really had much cause to worry. Well, not until now.</p> <p>Last weekend we learned that EDS, the private computing firm that handles IT for the prison service, has managed to <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7602402.stm\">mislay</a> a computer hard drive containing personal data about some 5,000 Ministry of Justice personnel. Obviously no one can tell us yet exactly who or what was on the drive, so while some quarters of the media have been busily hypothesising that people's <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4695548.ece\">bank details</a> and National Insurance numbers have vanished into a black hole at the company's headquarters in Telford, others have been <a href=\"http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/news/article22581.ece\">gleefully speculating</a> that the drive held more personal information, like staff addresses for instance. The implications of the second scenario are clear, and in the absence of any <a href=\"http://uk.news.yahoo.com/pressass/20080907/tuk-lost-data-disc-not-in-wrong-hands-6323e80.html\">firm reassurance</a> from Jack Straw that that's not what's happened, all I can do is hope that the disc drive isn't now lying around somewhere waiting for a violent ex-offender with a grudge to stumble upon it.</p> <p>When <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/nov/20/economy.personalfinancenews\">Revenue and Customs</a> lost everyone's child benefit data last November I wasn't too concerned. Yes, my information would have been on one of the missing discs, and if the discs had fallen into the wrong hands someone could probably have cleaned out my bank account: but at the end of the day a financial loss can be reimbursed. It would have been inconvenient and annoying to have had to deal with something like that, but it wouldn't have been the end of the world: no one's life would have been in danger for example. This time around I don't know what to think. Well okay, yes I do: I'm just trying really really hard not to.</p> <p>The revelation that EDS lost the data as long ago as July 2007 and has only now fessed up to it at least provides me with some reassurance. After all, if the worst-case scenario is true I would have expected something to have happened by now. We haven't had any late-night visitors prowling around outside the house as far as I'm aware, and certainly no macabre warnings posted through the letterbox; but that doesn't stop my family, along with thousands of other <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/7602442.stm\">prison service families</a>, from worrying. As Colin Moses, the chair of the Prison Officer's Association <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/06/privacy.justice?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=networkfront\">has said</a>: \"It is a breach that ... could ultimately cost the taxpayer millions and millions of pounds, because, if the information lost is personal and sensitive, it may well mean staff having to move prisons, move homes and relocate their families.\" We weren't planning on moving house any time soon, but if it turns out that our address was on that disc drive then we won't hesitate to do so: and as Moses rightly pointed out, it will be the taxpayer footing the bill, not us.</p> <p>But whatever was on the missing disc, one thing's clear from this fiasco: no one's confidential details are safe in this government's inept hands. If they can't even look after their own employees' records, then how on earth are they going to manage once they're responsible for everyone's personal data? If they can't keep the addresses of prison service staff away from prying eyes, then what hope is there of anyone's confidential information being stored securely? ID cards anyone? How about a national DNA database? No, I didn't think so.</p> <p>This is just the latest in a <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article4546434.ece\">succession of IT cock-ups</a> that together put paid to the lie that keeping tabs on everyone through a national database is not only in all our interests but also necessary for our own protection: hundreds of official laptops have either been stolen or left on trains, discs have seemingly vanished as if by magic while in transit from one government department to another, and local councils have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/jun/05/freedomofinformation\">misused the information</a> they hold to spy on local people. What else needs to happen before the architects of this madness wake up and realise that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jun/06/labour.civilliberties\">surveillance state</a> they're dreaming about simply isn't going to work? That far from keeping us safe, all it does is <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7441693.stm\">expose us</a> to even more risks and open up yet more opportunities for fraudsters and others to take advantage of. This big brother folly has to stop. This time it's prison service staff that have been put in needless danger, but if Brown and his acolytes push through with their plans, there's no telling who could be next. </p>",
  "<p>Alaska's legislators shook up the presidential race yesterday with a vote to subpoena Todd Palin, the husband of Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, to question him about whether she sacked the state's police chief in order to settle a personal score.</p> <p>The demand to interview Todd Palin was the latest move in a state senate investigation into accusations that Sarah Palin dismissed state public safety commissioner Walter Monegan because he refused to sack a state trooper caught in a messy divorce with Palin's sister. Palin maintains she let Monegan go over a budget dispute.</p> <p>If the investigation finds that Palin used her influence as governor to further a family matter, it could threaten McCain's bid for the presidency. The Republican party has sought to portray Palin, Alaska's governor since December 2006, as a corruption fighter.</p> <p>Stephen Branchflower, the former prosecutor conducting the inquiry for the state senate, did not seek to subpoena the governor but has said he would like to interview her. Todd Palin was one of 13 people the panel voted to subpoena. The state senate panel rejected efforts by two of its Republican members to delay the matter until after the November 4 election. Their report is due next month. The investigation began in the weeks before McCain selected Palin as his running mate . The Republicans say the inquiry is politically motivated.</p> <p>Monegan says that Palin, her aides and her husband, a commercial fisherman and oilfield worker, approached him and complained that trooper Mike Wooten was still employed by the department. Palin fired Monegan in July, and Monegan has publicly said he believes the firing was connected with his refusal to remove Wooten.</p> <p>Sarah Palin's sister Molly married Wooten in 2001 in April 2005 filed for divorce. The Palin family has said Wooten threatened to kill Sarah Palin's father and has lodged more than two dozen official complaints about him with the public safety department. An investigation found that Wooten illegally killed a moose, drank beer in a patrol car and demonstrated a Taser on his 10-year-old stepson. He remains on the force.</p> <p>Earlier, Palin gave voters a further glimpse of her views in a series of three interviews with ABC television that exposed gaps on climate change.<br>\"I'm attributing some of man's activities to potentially causing some of the changes in the climate right now,\" she told ABC's Charlie Gibson.</p> <p>The statement contradicted her past assertions that she did not believe global warming was a result of human activity. She denied expressing such doubts in her ABC interview, but she told the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner last December: \"I'm not an Al Gore, doom-and-gloom environmentalist blaming the changes in our climate on human activity.\" She also told ABC that Washington should not intervene if Israel attacked Iran's nuclear facilities and adopted a more hawkish posture towards Russia than George Bush. </p> <p>At a military ceremony on Thursday, Palin linked the Iraq war to al-Qaida and 9/11. The Washington Post said she told troops deploying to Iraq, including her son, Track, that they would \"defend the innocent from the enemies who planned and carried out and rejoiced in the death of thousands of Americans\".</p>"
