  "<p>The global financial crisis has wiped $50bn (\u00a327bn) from the value of the top global brands in the first weeks of September, according to a report by Brand Finance for <a href=\"http://MediaGuardian.co.uk\">MediaGuardian.co.uk</a>.</p> <p>Last week, Brand Finance said it had taken eight months, until the end of August, for a total of $67bn to be stripped off values of the top 100 brands. Its latest findings are that $50bn has been wiped off values so far this month - with 80% of the drop among financial services groups.</p> <p>Battered brands included Citibank, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, UBS and AIG. Others hit were Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse. Bank of America, which bought Merrill Lynch, retained brand value, while HSBC was resilient.</p> <p>Oliver Schmitz of Brand Finance said retail was the only sector that had not seen a decline in the past few weeks while Coca-Cola was another example of a strong brand. Brands such as Gucci and Louis Vuitton remained strong because they were highly aspirational, but their value was likely to fall as revenue forecasts were hit.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown will today seek to end the corrosive speculation surrounding his premiership with a speech in which he will promise to extend the welfare state, close the digital divide, and steer Britain through the global fiscal turmoil.</p> <p>In what is seen as the most important speech of his career after months of criticism, the prime minister will not directly attack the rebels calling for his removal, but seek to show he has the grit, intellect and grasp of the future to take Labour to a fourth term. One aide said: \"The speech's subtext is to prove there is no other politician than Brown that has the knowledge and experience to take the country through last week's threats to the whole edifice of British banking.\"</p> <p>Rather than dwelling on the setbacks and mistakes of the past 12 months, Brown will unveil initiatives aimed at lifting families and pensioners most vulnerable to the steep economic downturn, including:</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Computers and free broadband access for children lacking internet usage.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Extended help for carers with sick or elderly relatives.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> A \u00a31bn extension of childcare for children as young as two.</p> <p>Brown's speech, described as highly personal by his aides, has been set as a vital test by some disillusioned MPs, who doubt he can ever communicate a vision of what Labour is offering the country.</p> <p>And in a sign of the ongoing tension between supporters of Brown and David Miliband, a row broke out last night when the BBC reported Miliband had been overheard saying he toned down his conference speech in order to avoid outshining Brown. The BBC reported that the foreign secretary was heard telling an aide: \"I couldn't have gone any further. It would have been a Heseltine moment\" - an apparent reference to the idea Margaret Thatcher's demise was hastened by brilliant performances by her rival, Michael Heseltine. Miliband supporters said the report was incorrect, and spread by Brown aides.</p> <p>In a touch intended to underline Brown's seriousness, as opposed to what he considers the showmanship of David Cameron, he will speak from a lectern, without notes. He will tell delegates that he will spend \u00a3300m over three years giving 1.4 million children access to the internet with free broadband and computers.</p> <p>Vouchers worth from \u00a3100 to \u00a3700 will be given out by schools to unconnected households for broadband, software, and, if necessary, computers, so children can use open-learning techniques or equip themselves with IT skills.</p> <p>The government also believes the scheme will help teachers raise contact with parents on homework, their child's progress, and discipline.</p> <p>Ministers want parents and teachers to have regular internet contact, not once-a-term meetings.</p> <p>The money has been found by the schools minister, Jim Knight, through savings elsewhere in the children department's budget. He said it showed that even in tough economic times the government could find resources to reduce inequality and improve the life chances of millions.</p> <p>Many at the conference hope to hear not just a strong condemnation of City bonuses in Brown's speech, but also some intimation of action, or even a hint that taxes on the very rich will rise.</p> <p>In his speech yesterday, the chancellor, Alistair Darling, warned that \"huge bonuses can distort the way decisions\" are made by banks, but later indicated he did not plan any early legislation or taxes. He stressed that any solution would probably need to be global. Darling is acutely aware that, with so many jobs depending on financial services, he cannot afford to allow the rhetorical attacks on the City to get out of hand.</p> <p>Richard Lambert, CBI director general, said he had been given assurances by the party leaders yesterday that the left were \"whistling in the dark\" if they thought an ideological sea change towards City regulation was taking place at the top.</p> <p>Darling did continue to pave the way for higher borrowing, claiming the government could afford to \"let borrowing rise to support the economy and the families when they need it most\".</p> <p>In contrast, Miliband tried to lift the mood by saying \"these Tories are beatable\", adding: \"Just as I hate defeatism about our country, I hate defeatism about our party.\" The Brown camp was lifted by the Miliband speech , saying it did not represent a threat to his grip on power.</p> <p>Meanwhile the leadership brushed aside defeats when delegates backed a windfall tax on utilities, and an end to the opt-out on the 48-hour working week in the working-time directive. Both will be sent for further consideration.</p>",
  "<p>Banks should put aside reserves in the good times that they can draw down in times of bust to prevent crises such as that now pulling down whole economies, Bank of England deputy governor Sir John Gieve said yesterday.</p> <p>Outlining practical regulatory measures that could prevent banks' behaviour getting out of hand and which put flesh on the bones of the promises by Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling to clamp down on City excesses, Gieve said these should be used alongside interest rate setting to provide the central bank with a better set of tools to control the economy. \"We need to create reserves based on macroeconomic factors, which can be drawn down as the cycle turns down and have to be replenished on the upswing when profits are high,\" said Gieve.</p> <p>He pointed to Spain's \"dynamic provisioning\" system as having worked well in the credit crunch.</p> <p>Although Darling thinks there are considerable practical problems with forcing banks to make provisions during good times to draw on in bad, Gieve is a key part of government efforts to rein in some of the City's more dubious activities and therefore carries considerable weight.</p> <p>Gieve also said he now thought the dampening effect of the credit crunch on the economy could be bigger than thought - a possible hint he could soon be leaning towards voting for an interest rate cut.</p> <p>Meanwhile, finance ministers and central bank governors of the G7 industrial nations welcomed the $700bn (\u00a3382bn) US bailout plan for the financial industry and vowed to take \"whatever actions may be necessary\" to ensure the stability of the global financial system. US Treasury secretary Henry Paulson said he was \"aggressively\" encouraging other countries to copy his scheme. But there was little sign other governments were ready to follow Washington's lead in setting up funds to buy bad debts from crisis-stricken banks.</p>",
  "<p>As the world's largest producer of plastics made from plants, we wish to clarify John Vidal's claims about bioplastics (Sustainable bioplastic can damage the environment, April 26). While bioplastics are still on a journey to full sustainability, we believe they are the greenest alternative to conventional oil-based plastics. </p> <p>The advantages of bioplastic start in the manufacturing process. Peer-reviewed studies have found that making Ingeo - known generically as polylactic acid or PLA - generates less than half the greenhouse emissions of making oil-based plastics. New innovations in the manufacturing process mean Ingeo production will soon produce 75% less greenhouse emissions than making petro-plastics.</p> <p>The environmental benefits continue through the life of the plastic. Unlike conventional plastics, PLA is infinitely recyclable: a PLA bottle can be made into another bottle again and again, whereas oil-based competitors are typically \"down-cycled\" into products of diminishing value and ultimately destined for landfill. Ingeo is also certified as fully compostable in specific conditions. The Association for Organics Recycling (formerly the UK Composting Association) supports the increased use of biodegradable material as a means of reducing the 4.6m tonnes of packaging disposed of annually in the UK. </p> <p>Rising food prices are a serious concern today. At full capacity, we would use less than 0.1% of 2007 US corn production (all grown within 50 miles of our Nebraska plant). By contrast, about 30% of that crop went to make ethanol - a 300-fold difference.</p> <p>Affordable food, reliable energy and a healthy environment are global problems that cannot be solved without fundamental changes in the way we treat limited natural resources. We believe that plants, rather than fossil fuels, are a good place to start.<br><strong>Marc Verbruggen</strong><br>CEO, NatureWorks LLC</p>",
  "<p>Hirst high school technology college in Ashington, Northumberland, is in one of the most deprived areas of the country. Only one third of pupils go on to university. Although it has teamed up with Newcastle and Sunderland universities to encourage more pupils to consider higher education, Lesley Craig, the school's headteacher, says collaboration could be improved. \"Universities could do a lot more, by coming into schools and seeing the environment some of the students come from,\" she says. \"They run fantastic summer and Easter courses, but it is very much one-way traffic.</p> <p>\"They need to give greater consideration to how youngsters will make the transition to university,\" she says. Craig is concerned about the levels of pastoral welfare provided to students who are the first generation of their family to attend university.</p> <p>\"Some of these students contribute significantly to the dropout rate because the infrastructure of support that is available in school is either not available, or not as accessible, at university. Schools and universities need to work more closely on sharing this expertise and setting up support networks.\"</p> <p>Craig is not alone in wishing for a more integrated approach to efforts to widen participation in higher education. The Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce) is calling for a much more systematic approach. Although most universities offer campus visits, and have student ambassadors and summer schools, widening participation needs to move beyond these separate activities and become a more integrated process. \"It's about getting higher education institutions into schools - making them part of the school,\" says Kevin Whitston, head of widening participation at Hefce. \"Widening participation at 18 isn't going to work while only a third of young people from the lowest socio economic groups get five good GCSEs at 16.\"</p> <p>Some universities already have integrated outreach programmes. \"We offer a clear programme of outreach to pupils from the age of 12,\" says Rory Daly, senior development officer in widening participation at Lancaster University.</p> <p>Sheffield Hallam University has formal partnerships with 101 schools and colleges within a 50-60 mile radius of the city. These partnerships range from initial teacher training, continuing professional development to implementing strategies to support schools in raising aspirations and attainment. It's a two-way process, says Jacqui Ashmore, head of pre-enrolment and relationship management at the university. Teachers are more exposed to higher education. \"They know who to go to, who to talk to and can access the activities we offer in a more meaningful way,\" she says. The university, for its part, builds a more lasting relationship with schools.</p> <p><strong>Take advantage of universities</strong></p> <p>Hefce wants institutions to work more closely with schools on curriculum development and delivery. \"Schools should think through what they have to do in terms of delivering the curriculum and also talk to higher education institutions about how they can take advantage of the resources universities could offer them,\" says Whitston.</p> <p>Lancaster University is already closely involved in the school curriculum. Schools in Lancashire and Cumbria can take their entire year 12 into the university for a full day of lectures and seminars on aspects of their A-level courses. In addition, it also runs a programme, called Passport to Higher Education, for students who are about to start university but struggling to make their grade offer or unsure whether university is for them. Students attend a month-long programme at Lancaster University, after which they receive a university-accredited certificate. This is often accepted as supplementary evidence of ability.</p> <p>Sheffield Hallam University's curriculum involvement is primarily around vocational courses, although it also provides teaching materials for personal social and health education. \"Every faculty has some involvement in the development of the curriculum for the 14-19 diplomas,\" says Ashmore. </p> <p><strong>Mentors act as role models</strong></p> <p>At Haywood engineering college in Stoke- on-Trent, Staffordshire University provides activities in subjects such as engineering, forensic science and drama, while Keele University sends student mentors to act as role models and support pupils with their studies. \"We are very keen for universities to link with different curriculum areas,\" says Karen Whitmore, deputy headteacher at the school. </p> <p>Craig thinks this level of support can only be beneficial. \"A lot more work could be done in streamlining courses so that students do not feel they are going into completely unknown territory and can make instant links with prior learning and learning experiences,\" she says. </p> <p>Hefce would like institutions to go further still. But its proposals that universities become involved in the governance of schools are controversial. This would see higher education institutions being closely involved in the development of school improvement plans. </p> <p>\"We will look to fund two or three institutions to build governance links with schools in a way that offers a model which the sector can learn from,\" says Whitston. </p> <p>Although growing numbers of universities are sponsoring academy and trust schools, and therefore will be part of the school or college's governance structures, others do not wish to tie themselves to a particular institution and so may resist Hefce's proposals. </p> <p>Paul Dickinson, head of education and humanities at Sheffield Hallam University says, \"We are working with a number of schools and are involved in a range of educational partnerships. This enables us to work closely with many schools and we would be concerned that sponsoring a particular institution may damage the wide range of productive relationships that we currently enjoy.\"</p>",
  "<p>Governments need to show the same boldness to intervene in the markets to kickstart a move to a low-carbon economy as they did when they helped the banks stave off financial crisis last week, a leading academic has demanded.</p> <p>\"Both require strong regulation for efficient economic outcomes,\" said Terry Barker, a climate change expert at Cambridge University, who fears the Lehman Brothers and HBOS problems foreshadow a global economic downturn.</p> <p>Barker's concerns were backed up by one of the government's scientific advisers, who fears that a downturn could lead to a lack of investment in vital new sectors such as developing carbon capture and storage plants.</p> <p>\"When you have a downturn of this kind, it does lead to a disinvestment in this kind of technology,\" said Robert Watson, a former World Bank adviser who is now at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.</p> <p>There were marked similarities between the lack of transparency and action on complex lending risks that had wreaked havoc in the banking community and the kinds of dangers being stored up by corporate and political inaction over global warming, said Barker, the director of the centre for climate change mitigation research at Cambridge.</p> <p>\"Both threaten the economy with catastrophic collapse,\" added the economist, who has worked with the UN's Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change, and was speaking with Watson at the Entrepreneurship for a Zero Carbon Society conference at Cambridge University.</p> <p>Barker believes the problems on Wall Street will take potential investment money out of the system. But he says a determined response by ministers could encourage the channelling of that cash into vital work on climate change.</p> <p>He fears that governments and business leaders have massively underestimated the risks posed by rising sea levels and changing weather patterns - any costs associated with moving to a low-carbon economy were, he said, \"negligible\" compared with the costs of doing nothing.</p> <p>The banking crisis meant the rules of engagement by governments had changed completely, said Barker. The same system of \"force majeure\" was needed to tackle climate change through new eco-taxes, and help to supplement carbon trading.</p> <p>In the past, cost-benefit analyses had been applied to justify inaction on global warming, but this was inappropriate given the enormous scale of the social, environmental and other threats being faced. \"The Amazon rainforest and coral reefs cannot be substituted by money. It's obvious, but it needs repeating,\" said Barker.</p> <p>The Cambridge academic said EU carbon reduction targets were far too low and would have to be raised if the world was to stand a chance of tackling the problem. There needed to be a 40% reduction in carbon output by 2020, not the 20% target that was currently in place.</p> <p>Watson said action was needed on all fronts if the world was to avert disaster - and Britain should be forging ahead with nuclear, carbon capture and storage (CCS), and renewables such as wind, to ensure energy supplies were retained while carbon emissions fell.</p> <p>With regard to CCS, he said the world needed an equivalent of the Apollo space programme of the 1960s and 70s aimed at putting a man on the Moon. There should be 20 CCS prototypes developed at the same time - the possible $1bn (\u00a3500m) cost for each facility was tiny compared with the $300bn worth of fossil fuel subsidies or the trillions of pounds' worth of economic activity that the Stern Review had indicated would be endangered every year by inaction on climate change.</p>",
  "<p>The deadly blast in Islamabad was a revenge attack for what has been going on over the past few weeks in the badlands of the North-West Frontier. It highlighted the crisis confronting the new government in the wake of intensified US strikes in the tribal areas on the Afghan border. </p> <p>Hellfire missiles, drones, special operation raids inside Pakistan and the resulting deaths of innocents have fuelled Pashtun nationalism. It is this spillage from the war in Afghanistan that is now destabilising Pakistan. </p> <p>The de facto prime minister of the country, an unelected crony of President Zardari and now his chief adviser, Rehman Malik, said, \"our enemies don't want to see democracy flourishing in the country\". This was rich coming from him, but in reality it has little to do with all that. It is the consequence of a supposedly \"good war\" in Afghanistan that has now gone badly wrong. The director of US National Intelligence, Michael McConnell, admits as much, saying the Afghan leadership must deal with the \"endemic corruption and pervasive poppy cultivation and drug trafficking\" that is to blame for the rise of the neo-Taliban.</p> <p>The majority of Pakistanis are opposed to the US presence in the region, viewing it as the most serious threat to peace. Why, then, has the US decided to destabilise a crucial ally? Within Pakistan, some analysts argue this is a carefully coordinated move to weaken the Pakistani state by creating a crisis that extends way beyond the frontier with Afghanistan. Its ultimate aim, they claim, would be the extraction of the Pakistani military's nuclear fangs. If this were the case, it would imply Washington was determined to break up Pakistan, since the country would not survive a disaster on that scale.</p> <p>In my view, however, the expansion of the war relates far more to the Bush administration's disastrous occupation in Afghanistan. It is hardly a secret that President Karzai's regime is becoming more isolated each passing day, as Taliban guerrillas move ever closer to Kabul.</p> <p>When in doubt, escalate the war, is an old imperial motto. The strikes against Pakistan represent - like the decisions of President Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger, to bomb and then invade Cambodia - a desperate bid to salvage a war that was never good, but has now gone badly wrong.</p> <p>It is true that those resisting the Nato occupation cross the Pakistan-Afghan border with ease. However, the US has often engaged in quiet negotiations with them. Several feelers have been put out to the Taliban in Pakistan, while US intelligence experts regularly check into the Serena hotel in Swat to meet Maulana Fazlullah, a local pro-Taliban leader. </p> <p>Pashtuns in Peshawar, hitherto regarded as secular liberals, told the BBC only last week that they had lost all faith in the west. The decision to violate the country's sovereignty at will had sent them in the direction of the insurgents. </p> <p>While there is much grieving for the Marriott hotel casualties, some ask why the lives of those killed by Predator drones or missile attacks are considered to be of less value. In recent weeks almost 100 innocent people have died in this fashion. No outrage and global media coverage for them.</p> <p>Why was the Marriot targeted? Two explanations have surfaced in the media. The first is that there was a planned dinner for the president and his cabinet there that night, which was cancelled at the last moment. </p> <p>The second, reported in the respected Pakistani English-language newspaper, Dawn, is that \"a top secret operation of the US Marines [was] going on inside the Marriott when it was attacked\". According to the paper: \"Well-equipped security officers from the US embassy were seen on the spot soon after the explosions. However, they left the scene shortly afterwards.\"</p> <p>The country's largest newspaper, the News, also reported on Sunday that witnesses had seen US embassy steel boxes being carried into the Marriott at night on September 17. According to the paper, the steel boxes were permitted to circumvent security scanners stationed at the hotel entrance.</p> <p>Mumtaz Alam, a member of parliament, witnessed this. He wanted to leave the hotel but, owing to the heavy security, he was not permitted to leave at the time and is threatening to raise the issue in parliament. </p> <p>These may be the motivations for this particular attack, but behind it all is the shadow of an expanding war.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Tariq Ali's latest book is The Duel: Pakistan On the Flight Path of American Power </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:tariqali3@btinternet.com\">tariqali3@btinternet.com</a></p>",

  "<p>Sir James Dyson leans back in his chair, bringing a brightly coloured display of vacuum cleaners into sharp focus behind him. At this point our interview takes a slightly strange turn - Dyson, it transpires, has some questions for the Guardian. What can we tell him about the pursuit of a Freedom of Information (FOI) request? What works; how much time does it take? It seems a fitting illustration of the working of the entrepreneur's mind - after a lifetime of thinking laterally, he has clearly learned to marshal all the available resources in pursuit of his goals.</p> <p>Woe betide anyone who tries to stop the inventor in mid-project, for he is clearly a man who enjoys a challenge. And right now he is preparing to do battle with the communities secretary, Hazel Blears, over his plans to build a school for young engineers and designers in Bath.</p> <p>Dyson wants to know why Blears, under pressure from the Environment Agency, which says his chosen site is on a flood plain, decided last month to call a planning inquiry into his application for the school. His request to see the relevant paperwork was refused; the project's trustees meet this month to discuss what to do next. Already \u00a32.5m of the \u00a312.5m being injected into the \u00a356m project by the James Dyson Foundation has been spent, and the inquiry could cost a further \u00a31m in fees, he says. Meanwhile, Blears's officials are considering how to respond to his FOI request.</p> <p><strong>Seeking information</strong></p> <p>\"We want to see the documentation that led her to make this decision before we decide what to do,\" Dyson explains emphatically. \"Legal action to force her to revoke the inquiry is a possibility. We've spent a lot of money on this and she has dismissed it in such a cavalier manner ... we're not taking part in an inquiry until we see what information she used to come to this decision.\"</p> <p>The plan to build a Dyson School of Design Innovation on the banks of the River Avon was meant to nurture the next generation of inventors, engineers and designers. Unusually, it would teach 14- to 16-year-olds on a part-time basis on day-release from school, but would also take 16- to 19-year-old students full time. Companies might also choose to send existing staff for further training. The lessons would largely be project-based, problem-solving exercises, and the most successful results could be marketed commercially.</p> <p>The need for such a facility is dire, Dyson argues. \"Fewer and fewer children are choosing to read engineering at university - we have 37,000 vacancies each year and 23,000 engineering graduates, and not all of them go into engineering. So we are under-producing what we need and British companies are establishing research bases overseas because they can't get the skills here.\"</p> <p>Britain's 23,000 engineering graduates, he points out, compares with 450,000 a year in China and 350,000 in India. As a result, the number of new patents granted here is dropping in relation to other major industrialised nations.</p> <p>The building, on the site of the old Stothert &amp; Pitt crane factory, would be a combination of an existing listed frontage and a modern, curving glass building with its own bridge across to the centre of Bath.</p> <p>The Confederation of British Industry has backed the plan, saying that without an injection of new British entrepreneurs and innovators the economy will continue to lose out to foreign competition. And some of Blears's ministerial colleagues have been enthusiastic, too.</p> <p>In his Innovation Nation white paper, published in March, the skills secretary, John Denham, gave the project an enthusiastic write-up: \"The new school will be a national centre of excellence for design engineering, offering new and exciting approaches to hands-on learning. Industry specialists from companies such as Airbus and Rolls-Royce, as well as Dyson, will have a real involvement in the curriculum, giving students an understanding of the leading role UK engineering plays in the world economy.\"</p> <p>The white paper went on to say the school was expected to open in 2010, though that date has now slipped to 2012 as a result of the decision to hold an inquiry and other planning delays. Dyson was quoted there, too, worrying about the low numbers of young people studying design, technology and engineering.</p> <p>When we meet at his research and design facility in Malmesbury, Wiltshire - he used to have a vacuum cleaner factory here but moved it to Malaysia after a previous planning spat - he claims statistics show that engineers are among Britain's happiest workers. So why, then, does he think the numbers choosing the profession are dwindling?</p> <p>\"I think what's fairly obvious is that schools and parents talk children out of doing design and technology. It may not be all their fault, because I don't think universities regard it as a serious enough A-level, and I don't entirely blame them, but I have no doubt it happens,\" he says.</p> <p>\"I think it's got worse, actually, because when I was brought up, even if there wasn't a great interest in engineering, there were a lot of British products. The Mini, the Morris Minor ... we bought British furniture and British lighting. But over the past 40 or 50 years it's just got worse and worse. The trend into service industries and professional life has just got stronger and stronger, to the point where being a retailer almost carries more status than being a manufacturer.\"</p> <p>That said, he adds that the local schools have been enthusiastic about the project. Its trustees include the vice-chancellor of Bath University, Glynis Breakwell, and the former Conservative cabinet minister Lord Waldegrave, and its brochure includes messages of support from the Learning and Skills Council and various industrialists as well as the local MP, Don Foster.</p> <p>Yet the plan has proved controversial locally. A recent article in the Bath Chronicle about the planning inquiry drew no fewer than 163 messages on the paper's talkboard, with opponents and supporters arguing fiercely. And there is a further cloud on the horizon - Unesco, the UN's agency for education, science and culture, has announced that it plans to visit Bath to look at the Dyson project, along with other planned developments. The agency has expressed concern that the riverside scheme might harm the city's status as a World Heritage site.</p> <p>The Department of Communities and Local Government did not want to comment on Dyson's complaints, other than to quote the formal letter in which it said it was calling an inquiry to consider both the flood risk and the effect of the plans on Bath as a heritage site.</p> <p><strong>Safety is paramount</strong></p> <p>The Environment Agency's south-west area manager, Nick Gupta, said it had little option but to object because the school was being built on a flood plain. The safety of the school's pupils was paramount.</p> <p>\"We are not against the development of a new academy in Bath,\" he said. \"The site that has been proposed ... is in the highest risk of all the flood zones. When it floods, the students would be marooned upstairs in the building. So given the choice, why would you put any development, let alone a school, in such a high-risk area?\"</p> <p>Meanwhile Dyson, who is already working with schools through his James Dyson Foundation charity, is unrepentant. He claims the Environment Agency has breached its own guidelines in refusing to speak to him for the past 18 months.</p> <p>He dismisses reports that he might decide to throw the whole thing up and start an academy in the US instead - \"we're very committed to this site\" - but he does suggest the trustees might decide instead to concentrate on web-based remote learning, into which they are already venturing. But Dyson does not seem like a man who gives up easily.</p> <p>\"We still want to do it on that site, and we want the inquiry revoked,\" he says. \"I never like to look at things negatively, and I expect Hazel Blears to revoke it. I hope she sees sense.\"</p>",
  "<p>Climate change sceptics such as Nigel Lawson who argue that global warming has stopped have their \"heads in the sand\", according to the Met Office.</p> <p>A recent dip in global temperatures is down to natural changes in weather systems, a new analysis shows, and does not alter the long-term warming trend.</p> <p>The office says average temperatures have continued to rise in the last decade, and that humans are to blame.</p> <p>In a statement published on its website, it says: \"Anyone who thinks global warming has stopped has their head in the sand. The evidence is clear, the long-term trend in global temperatures is rising, and humans are largely responsible for this rise. Global warming does not mean that each year will be warmer than the last.\"</p> <p>The new research confirms that the world has cooled slightly since 2005, but says this is down to a weather phenomena called La Ni\u00f1a, when cold water rises to the surface of the Pacific Ocean. Despite this effect, the office says, 11 of the last 13 years were the warmest ever recorded.</p> <p>Vicky Pope, of the Met Office, said the research was a response to claims made by Lawson, a former chancellor, and others that the recent cooling showed fears of climate change were overblown, and temperatures were unlikely to rise as high as predicted. She said: \"It has confused people. We got a lot of emails asking whether global warming had stopped and it prompted us to look at the data again.\"</p> <p>The apparent cooling trend was exaggerated by a record high in 1998 caused by a separate weather event, El Ni\u00f1o, she said. \"You could look at what happened in 1998 and say that global warming accelerated, and that's not true either.\"</p>",

At one point, the price was up by as much as $25 - about 10 times the typical daily variation.</p> <p>The jump in oil came as the US dollar slumped and Wall Street stocks suffered yet another tailspin on concern over the cost of the Bush administration's planned $700bn rescue package for teetering financial institutions. In London, the FTSE 100 index dropped 75 points to 5,236.</p> <p>The increase in the price of the industrialised world's key fuel was so large that the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission said it was examining whether anybody was taking advantage of the \"current stresses\" facing the financial system. \"Enforcement staff will scour today's trading activity to determine whether anyone engaged in illegal manipulative activity,\" said the commission's head of enforcement, Stephen Obie. \"No one should be trying to game our nation's commodity futures markets.\"</p> <p>The controversy revived allegations raised earlier this year that speculators have been driving global oil prices higher. Such was the concern about rocketing prices that the US authorities proposed fines of $1m a day for anybody caught manipulating prices - but the issue lost momentum over the summer as prices fell from a peak of $147 to $90 a barrel.</p> <p>Over the last few weeks, global oil prices have risen again as hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico damaged offshore rigs and disrupted supplies. Technical factors compounded the trend yesterday as it was the last opportunity to buy a key futures contract to take delivery of oil in October. Some market participants were scrambling to unwind \"short\" positions, which are bets that prices will fall. Stephen Schork, editor of a commodities newsletter, the Schork Report, said: \"Today was an absolute one-off. A group of traders were short in the market. This was a textbook squeeze.\"</p> <p>Experts said another reason for upward pressure was a slump in the dollar against all major currencies, caused by anxiety about the cost of the US government's $700bn bailout of struggling banks. The pound gained more than a cent to close at $1.84 and the euro jumped by 2.3 cents to $1.47. A weak dollar usually means higher oil as investors turn to commodities as a hedge.</p> <p>Congress has begun scrutinising the Bush administration's plan to rescue teetering banks by spending hundreds of billions of dollars buying up unwanted mortgage-related securities. The proposal prompted a sell-off in US investments across the board as economists digested the potential cost to the Federal Reserve.</p> <p>At the closing bell on Wall Street, the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen 372 points to 11,015 - a reversal of the stockmarket's enthusiasm on Friday when Treasury secretary Henry Paulson's proposals first emerged.</p> <p>With volatility at historic levels, investors have been fleeing to traditionally safe havens. The price of gold rose by 5%.</p>",
  "<p>One of Gordon Brown's pet energy projects - to build up to a dozen pilot plants to capture and store carbon dioxide as power stations burn coal to generate electricity - would require EU subsidies of as much as \u20ac10bn (\u00a37.9bn) over the next few years, it emerged yesterday.</p> <p>A study by the consultancy McKinsey into carbon capture and storage (CCS) showed that such plants could be economically viable by 2030 at the latest. But it would require substantial public subsidies to get 10-12 plants running by the EU target date of 2015.</p> <p>They cost twice or three times as much as conventional coal plants: about \u20ac2bn for the 300 megawatt plants planned by the industry, which is refusing to go ahead without public subsidies.</p> <p>CCS is highly controversial, with green campaigners split down the middle over the issue. It involves capturing and compressing the CO2, transporting it to sites such as disused oil and gas fields or deep saline aquifers, and permanently storing it there.</p> <p>But McKinsey said that, with coal still likely to make up 60% of EU power generation by 2030, CCS could be a vital solution to ensuring security of energy supply and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. </p> <p>It could reduce emissions by 400m tonnes a year by 2030, or a fifth of planned European savings. The consultants' report, published yesterday, showed that with an aggressive commercial push from the middle of the next decade, CCS costs could come down from as much as \u20ac90 for a tonne of CO2 initially, to about \u20ac30-45 in 2030 - or in line with expected carbon prices then.</p> <p>At the report's launch, Chris Davies, a Liberal Democrat MEP and the European parliament's rapporteur on CCS, said a deal could be struck soon to supply the public subsidies needed to kickstart the demonstration plants.</p> <p>His solution is to take the billions from a strategic reserve - worth up to \u20ac18bn - set aside under the EU's emissions trading scheme for the creation of new, \"green\" plants. He claimed a majority of MEPs on the environment committee would endorse his scheme early next month.</p> <p>Davies said: \"We need to put this financing mechanism in place very quickly, deliver it to developers, and do it at a European level. If we leave it to national capitals, I'm not confident the projects will go ahead, and time is already running out.\"</p> <p>But he said the subsidies would have to be monitored; through the European Investment Bank, for example, which would run tenders for the pilot plants and ensure that the public was not being \"fleeced\".</p> <p>Andris Piebalgs, EU energy commissioner, said he personally favoured the Davies scheme, but could not commit the entire European commission. \"The technology could compete with nuclear, solar, wind and gas, and help combat climate change not only in Europe but China, India and the US,\" he said.</p> <p>Senior French officials said the EU council of ministers, which so far has opposed Davies's scheme, was considering alternative funding, such as revenues from the auctioning of pollution permits under the emissions trading scheme or from national or EU budgets.</p> <p>Lars Josefsson, the chief executive of the Swedish power producer Vattenfall - which is promoting a small pilot plant with the German gases group Linde - said a swift financing solution was vital: \"The boards of companies are not allowed to use shareholders' money recklessly and rack up billions of losses. We will invest in CCS if the funding gap is bridged.\"</p>",
  "<p>When Anna Brassington returned to work after the birth of her daughter, she used a local childminder. But at 18 months, Emma's language and motor skills seemed to be going backwards. She was moved to a day nursery in the hope that a more stimulating environment might help her development. But by three, her behaviour was increasingly demanding and staff felt they could no longer cope. </p> <p>Medical investigations revealed Emma had Rett Syndrome, a neurological disorder that causes physical disability and learning difficulties. She was offered a place at a local authority nursery for children with special needs, but with the nursery hours operating around the typical school day, it was the beginning of an ongoing struggle for her parents. </p> <p>\"You feel as if the system is stacked against you,\" says Brassington. \"Suitable childcare for disabled children is difficult to find and expensive. The only alternative is to live on state benefits, which means living in poverty.\" Carers' allowance is just \u00a350.55 and there is no additional help towards childcare through the working families tax credits. </p> <p>As the main wage earner, being a full-time carer wasn't an option for Brassington. Her husband gave up his IT job and became a taxi driver so he could work flexible hours. With no family nearby, they had to rely on friends and neighbours. </p> <p>According to Contact A Family, a UK charity, their story isn't unusual. \"Lack of affordable, appropriate childcare remains the biggest barrier to paid work for families with disabled children,\" says its chief executive, Srabani Sen. </p> <p>Under the Disability Discrimination Act, private and voluntary nurseries are obliged to make \"reasonable adjustments\" to accommodate disabled children. But there are practical and financial barriers to overcome, says Purnima Tanuku, chief executive of the National Day Nurseries' Association. \"Day nurseries rely on parental fees, and many cannot offer the appropriate service without significant fee increases. For example, if a child requires one-to-one care, the parent cannot be expected to pay the carer's salary and the nursery is forced to subsidise this cost.\" </p> <p>The Childcare Act of 2006 makes local authorities responsible for providing high-quality, affordable childcare for all children. But while some have provision in place, others seem to have nothing. It can be difficult for nurseries to access the support they need. </p> <p>Helen Beckett (not her real name) fought a year-long battle to get help with childcare for her son James, who has epilepsy and cerebral palsy. Her local day nursery was happy to accommodate him one day a week from four months old, while she went out to work. Problems arose when he turned two and was due to move up to the toddler group. \"He wasn't walking or crawling by then and the room wasn't really suitable for children who weren't on their feet,\" she says. \"He was ready to move on, be with children more his own age, but without one-to-one support I knew he wouldn't manage.\" </p> <p>To help him make the transition, Beckett offered to pay for one hour of one-to-one support per week and a suitably qualified professional was found. Then social services paid the nursery a visit and put a stop to the arrangement, claiming it was illegal for a parent to pay for additional support. The local authority was not prepared to fund help (the cost was just \u00a37 a week) and three-year-old James was returned to the baby group. </p> <p>With support from Scope Response, a national helpline, Beckett has recently secured funding for a six-week trial period, but the experience has left her drained. \"The government say they want to get families out to work, but for parents of children with disabilities, there are so many hurdles.\" </p> <p>Linda Baston-Pitt, who runs the Old School House day nursery in Suffolk, has secured support for a number of children with disabilities. She believes help is available from local authorities, but only if you know your way around the system. \"It's all about networking,\" she says. \"As a former community nurse, I'm quite well connected. But relatively inexperienced nursery managers don't know where to start.\"</p> <p>For some families, a childminder can be the answer. The National Childminding Association has national networks catering for children with disabilities. The Bromley Mencap Children Come First Childminding (CCF) network in Kent works with the learning disabilities charity Mencap and the Bromley Council Early Years Team. Although her daughter is now at school, Brassington uses a childminder from the Bromley Mencap CCF network for after-school care. However, school holidays still pose difficulties. \"There are local authority summer holiday schemes, but you have to reapply every year and complete a mountain of paperwork. There's no guarantee of a place so it's very stressful,\" she says. </p> <p>Contact A Family is lobbying the government to offer parents better support. \"We would like to see an increase in the childcare element of working tax credit to give them a real choice about re-entering the workplace,\" says Sen.</p>",
  "<p>Britain needs to undergo a \"renaissance in nuclear power\", and coal will continue to be a \"critically important fuel\" for the country, the business secretary, John Hutton, said yesterday.</p> <p>In a speech which drew immediate criticism from environmental groups, Hutton said that the two controversial sources of energy were crucial to ensure that Britain retained a secure energy supply.</p> <p>The international battle for energy security poses a threat to Britain's competitiveness and its \"sovereignty as a nation\", he said. </p> <p>\"It means a renaissance in nuclear power. Low carbon, reliable, secure ... And because energy security is a first thought, not an afterthought, I will not turn my back on another critical source of energy security for the UK, coal.\"</p> <p>The business secretary took a swipe at David Cameron, who has said he would ensure that a new generation of \"unabated coal power plants\" could not be built by imposing a California-style emissions performance standard.</p> <p>Hutton said: \"I understand that people feel passionate about this issue. Others, like the Tories, see an opportunity for pandering. But coal is critically important for the UK. Flexible. Available. Reducing our reliance on imported gas.\"</p> <p>Hutton's remarks show that Labour believes Cameron could be vulnerable on energy as high oil prices and the wider global economic downturn make people wary of restrictions on fuel even if they are designed to help the environment.</p> <p>Cameron has since indicated that he would be prepared to allow a new generation of nuclear power stations, though he warns that he would not provide any \"blank cheques\".</p> <p>Hutton said Britain had to look beyond weathering the current economic storm to make changes - \"emerging stronger and fitter to seize the new manufacturing opportunities in the green economy and global markets of tomorrow\". </p> <p>Greenpeace criticised Hutton's support for coal-fired power stations, saying they would make a \"colossal contribution\" to climate change. </p> <p>Executive director, John Sauven, said: \"John Hutton somehow manages to sound like a cross between Arthur Scargill and Margaret Thatcher ... The Iron Lady said she would build as many new nuclear stations as Hutton is promising but she managed just one because the economics didn't stand up - and they still don't.\" </p> <p>Robin Webster of Friends of the Earth added: \"Peddling a new generation of coal-fired power stations before we even know if carbon capture and storage is going to work is dangerous and misleading. Hutton has failed to grasp the serious threat posed by climate change or the huge potential of renewable energy.\"</p>",
  "<p>Alisher Usmanov will step aside and allow Stan Kroenke to take over Arsenal without a fight once the current shareholder-directors decide to sell up.</p> <p>Both suspect that Danny Fiszman, the most powerful individual on the Arsenal board, is setting up an auction for the day when he cashes in on his 24.11% stake. But Usmanov would prefer to be a sleeping investor rather than fight Kroenke for the club. Kroenke's relationship with the Arsenal board is clearly better developed than Usmanov's, as evidenced by the American's co-option as a director last Friday. Yet Usmanov, with a \u00a3100m-plus investment in the club, is the largest single shareholder and he continues to pay \u00a38,700 for individual shares as they appear on the market.</p> <p>His motives for doing so, however, have switched from a desire for control to the belief that even at their current \u00a3870m debt-plus-equity value Arsenal are underpriced. The shift in emphasis may also explain the departure of David Dein as chairman of Usmanov's investment vehicle, Red &amp; White Holdings. The former vice-chairman has made no secret of his desire to return to the Emirates stadium but Usmanov will not deliver him that route.</p> <p>The well-connected Dein remains wedded to the belief that Arsenal can survive in the Premier League only with a billionaire investor. With Kroenke expected to fund any acquisition through loans loaded on the club, the prospect of Dein delivering an even wealthier third-party investor should not be ruled out.</p> <h2>Sky hit by Faldo's tactics</h2> <p>Sky Sports showed 14 fewer commercial breaks than the American host broadcaster, NBC, at the Ryder Cup over the weekend. But the satellite channel's decision to front-load its ad breaks during the final-day singles matches in order to show more golf at the climax of play backfired. With Europe's team captain, Nick Faldo, having made a hash of his picks, the match was all over before the box-office names of Ian Poulter, Lee Westwood and the back-to-back Open champion, Padraig Harrington, had reached the 18th green.</p> <h2>Davis Cup exit not so dear</h2> <p>Britain's Davis Cup defeat to Austria means the Lawn Tennis Association will miss out on a greater share of the tournament's $9m (\u00a34.8m) in prize money but in all likelihood the failure to progress will not cost British tennis anything in financial terms. The size of the crowd is unlikely to be affected whether Great Britain are in the elite world group or the lower zonal group. Although Austria's win was worth $28,000 more than the LTA's prize of $64,000, the cost of staging the tie means the LTA expects to have made a net loss. Early estimates from the sale of 9,200 pre-booked premium-price tickets for last Friday's action and a further 7,300 for Sunday suggest gate receipts of more than \u00a3500,000. But that does not cover the cost of hiring and stewarding Wimbledon's Court One. The financial services group Aegon may be less sanguine. It committed to a \u00a325m title sponsorship of the LTA last week and begins the five-year deal with Britain once again outside the Davis Cup world group.</p> <h2>Jobs for the boys?</h2> <p>The feeling that Seb Coe's hand is on the shoulder of UK Athletics will only be strengthened if Daley Thompson, below, joins the governing body in a coaching capacity. The double Olympic decathlon champion was once an athlete mentor for UKA but his relationship with the former performance director, Dave Collins, was summed up in a Radio 5 interview yesterday: \"I don't think Collins knew a lot about performance.\" It is only now that Charles van Commenee is about to replace Collins - he will be appointed today after the latter was sacked following British athletics' poor showing in Beijing - that Thompson is prepared to become involved again. Lord Coe was influential in Van Commenee's decision to join UKA and Thompson is Coe's best mate. Jobs for the (admittedly very well-qualified) boys perhaps?</p>",
  "<p>Two knife titles on one longlist might seem provocative in the current sensitive climate. But the young critics who reviewed the books in contention for the Guardian Children's Fiction Prize were certainly not put off by the titles or contents.</p> <p>\"I think that knife crime is a good topic, as he is able to make people think about the consequences,\" Aashik Chhibber wrote, in his thoughtful review of Anthony McGowan's The Knife That Killed Me. He praised McGowan for being \"really insightful into what it is like to be a teenager and the struggle many teens face, as well as some of the reasons they may carry knives\". Rajesh Jethwa thought it \"a brilliant book\". He liked the humour of the story and the way McGowan described the knife as if \"it were made inside a legend\". He also thought \"the end was a great feat of Mr McGowan's imagination\".</p> <p>Having synthesised the complex plot of Patrick Ness's The Knife of Never Letting Go in two pithy paragraphs, Danny Rattray writes: \"This is one of the best stories I've ever read, and I cannot wait for book two. Patrick really knows his stuff, keeping valuable information back from the reader to keep them guessing.\" Robert Brooks (from the winning school, Westbourne school in Sheffield) summed up the book as \"a heart-warming coming-of-age story with a twist of fantasy\". He adds: \"The book starts off funny - it says about how quickly you find out how little a dog has to say when it starts to talk - but then gets sadder as the deaths start occurring.\" Like Danny, he is eagerly waiting for the sequel, as is Jack Owen who, after saying \"readers will find themselves racing through the book desperate to find out what unexpected twists lie in the following pages and to unearth the secrets that remain hidden in Todd's world,\" ended with, \"and the best thing about it is, there is a sequel!\"</p> <p>Although books for eight and up are eligible for the prize, this year's titles were mostly pitched at older readers. Only Frank Cottrell Boyce's Cosmic, about a boy whose unnatural height causes him to be mistaken for an adult and so find himself on a trip to the moon, in a witty story that is also insightful about the relationship between fathers and their children, is for eight-year-olds. </p> <p>Nicholas Wiseman, aged eight, like many other entrants, summed it up as \"COSMIC!\". He enjoyed the adventure as as well as the insights into \"dadhood\". Sam Norris, nine, dissected his review into bullet points, including \"Naughty but nice: Getting to drive a Porsche Boxster\". </p> <p>Despite the apparently obvious hint of violence in the two titles with \"knife\" in them, it was Tanya Landman's The Goldsmith's Daughter, a historical novel set at the time of Montezuma, which involved the most gore. Suzanna Eames was \"captivated from the start\" as she was drawn into Aztec society and the story of Itacate and her terrible fate. \"The inspiring writing kept me eagerly reading, feeling and imagining every experience she describes.\" Beth Butler, one of the entrants from Westbourne school, identified how Landman achieved that sense of involvement, saying \"the book is written in the first person, which is good because it means that when she can't show her emotions you still know her secrets and how she is feeling in some detail\".</p> <p>Katie McCombes described Siobhan Dowd's Bog Child as \"stunningly realised and superbly written\". She was compelled by the complex, multi-layered drama of the story in which Fergus, living through The Troubles, is also involved in the find of the bog child of the title. \"Every detail creates a vivid and convincing portrayal of what it was like to live in the tense, violent atmosphere of 1980s Northern Ireland.\" Summing up, she adds, \"this is a shimmering pearl of a novel\".</p> <p>\"Bad Blood is a chilling read, not to be read after dark...\" warns Nancy Netherwood of Rhiannon Lassiter's dark family tale shot through with hints from the supernatural. Not that it deterred her. Nancy loved the clever plotting and strong characters, describing it as an \"incredible book, combining modern family troubles with a world of sinister magic\". Tommie Hassall, from Westbourne school, was also gripped. \"The book's pace is riveting. It holds the reader in the haunting world of the supernatural but does not shy away from the reality of the modern-day family, homosexuality and mental illness.\"</p> <p>When it came to Before I Die, Jenny Downham's story of 16-year-old Tessa, who is determined to fit in all the teen experiences she looks set to miss as she is dying of leukaemia, differences of gender in reading became obvious. While boys ignored it, girls adored it. Sophia Christmann called it \"a book I will definitely never forget,\" saying, \"the combination of the content, the structure and the way Tessa's final moments are laid out make the story heartbreakingly sad\". </p> <p>Olivia Scott-Berry praised Downham for \"pulling no punches\" and for \"weaving an inspiring, touching and ultimately life-affirming tale\". Izzy Mathie loved the fact that Tessa \"isn't perfect\", recognising that Downham makes her \"a real person, just a normal teenager in every way but one\". Izzy added: \"I was anticipating Tessa's death throughout the whole book, and was heavy-hearted when it finished, and yet I finished it oddly appreciating the tiniest things in life, and, of course, the fact that I have my whole life before me.\"</p> <h2>The Guardian list</h2> <p><strong>Cosmic*</strong> Frank Cottrell Boyce, Macmillan, \u00a39.99</p> <p><strong>The Knife of Never Letting Go</strong> Patrick Ness, Walker, \u00a312.99</p> <p><strong>Before I Die</strong>* Jenny Downham, David Fickling Books, \u00a36.99</p> <p><strong>Bog Child</strong>* Siobhan Dowd, David Fickling Books, \u00a310.99</p> <p><strong>The Knife</strong> <strong>That Killed Me </strong>Anthony McGowan, Definitions, \u00a35.99</p> <p><strong>The Goldsmith's Daughter </strong>Tanya Landman, Walker, \u00a36.99</p> <p><strong>Bad Blood </strong>Rhiannon Lassiter, Oxford, \u00a35.99</p> <p>* denotes books on the shortlist</p> <h2>Winning young critics</h2> <p>Aashik Chhibber (14); Sophia Christmann (14); Suzanne Eames (14); Rajesh Jethwa (13); Katie McCombes (15); Izzy Mathie (13); Nancy Netherwood (13); Sam Norris (9); Jack Owen (14); Danny Rattray (14); Olivia Scott-Berry (14); Nicholas Wiseman (8).

  "<p>Would you love to know what school is like for children in Africa? Do you have difficult questions to put to ministers about what they are doing to give all children primary education?</p> <p>Could you be the one to bridge the gap between pupils in schools here and in developing countries? Could you help people to understand the problems children in developing countries face to get an education? Or do you fancy yourself as a TV presenter, raising awareness about the campaign for global education?</p> <p>If so, and you're aged between 13 and 16, you could win the chance to see first-hand what education in a developing country is like and meet fellow pupils. On your return, you'll be expected to tell everyone about your experiences and to help present the issues on a DVD that will be sent to all schools.</p> <p><strong>Steve Sinnott award</strong></p> <p>The Steve Sinnott Award for Young Global Education Campaigners has been launched by a group of the major overseas aid agencies that believe education is the key to escaping poverty.</p> <p>The Global Campaign for Education (GCE) - a coalition between ActionAid, Comic Relief, Oxfam and Sightsavers - set up the award using donations to the memorial fund for Steve Sinnott, the former general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, who died in April. During his time as the head of the NUT, Sinnott was a very involved and passionate member of GCE and a committed advocate of education for all. The award is in recognition of that. Sinnott's widow, Mary, will be one of the judges, as will Claire Phipps, editor of Education Guardian.</p> <p>The award winners, accompanied by their teacher and a Guardian journalist, will travel to a developing country, meet pupils, teachers, union members and politicians and hear in person of the progress being made in, and the issues surrounding, education in that country.</p> <p>In 2000, world leaders signed up to a target to give all children a primary education by 2015. Though progress has been made, 72 million children are still missing out.</p> <p>The idea of the award, which will initially run for three years, is to get UK young campaigners to help \"spread the word\" by speaking to their peers, at union conferences and to the media. They will have a chance to get involved during the Global Action Week '09 and to initiate their own activities.</p> <p>To be considered, schools will need to demonstrate that they have already been involved in campaigning for global education. Teachers must write 300 words giving evidence of what their school has done so far to help global education.</p> <p>Schools should also nominate two pupils to present - in any way they like - ideas for future activities they would like to undertake as a result of this scheme. They could make a PowerPoint presentation, a podcast or a film, for instance.</p> <p>GCE will be looking for entries that give ideas of how to grab young people's attention, says Janet Convery, head of youth and schools at ActionAid, one of the charities behind the scheme. \"We'll be looking for young people who are powerful speakers themselves and who have lots of creative ideas about how to engage large numbers of young people.</p> <p>\"Children listen to other children, so they are much more effective communicators with their own peer group than we will ever be. They will get the opportunity to ask questions and start to understand big, complex issues and then to communicate them to their own peer group when they get back,\" she says.</p> <p><strong>Understanding the issues</strong></p> <p>The winners will also help to present a DVD produced by GCE and given to all schools on education development issues.</p> <p>According to Convery, several complicated development issues act as barriers to education. The award will allow the winners to grapple with the problems in greater depth and pass on their understanding.</p> <p>\"Education systems are very expensive to run so a lot of it comes down to an individual country's capacity to create the infrastructure to provide education for everyone,\" Convery says. \"They need to have the resources, the political will and a plan for education as a key to it all.\"</p> <p>The government leaders who signed up to the millennium development goals have also failed to put enough money into the pool of cash countries can draw from when they have an education plan in place, Convery says. \"Unfortunately, that pool of money has never been big enough to meet the demand.\"</p> <p> The closing date for the award is November 14. Shortlisted applicants will need to be available to do a presentation to the judging panel in central London at the end of November. Winners will need to travel during February or March 2009.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> For further details on how to apply please contact: <a href=\"mailto:karen.garvin@actionaid.org.uk\">karen.garvin@actionaid.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>The number of top 500 global firms reporting their carbon emissions reduction targets to the investment community has fallen, but climate change is still rising fast up the corporate agenda, a new report claims.</p> <p>The Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), a scheme developed by 385 of the world's biggest investors holding assets worth $57tn (\u00a331tn), says only 74% of leading companies have reported their strategy for reducing emissions this year, down from 76% a year earlier.</p> <p>And while more than 80% of firms in the Standard &amp; Poor's leading 500 listed US firms accept that climate change is a risk, only a third of them have plans to reduce pollution. The project's organisers believe the fall in the number of firms reporting on emissions cuts can be put down to a changing world economic order that has pitched more Asian companies into the top 500.</p> <p>Chinese, Indian and other businesses are traditionally less aware of greenhouse gas issues because many of these countries are not obliged to make reductions in carbon under the Kyoto Protocol as they are in Europe.</p> <p>Overall, more companies responded to the carbon disclosure project - 1,550 of the world's biggest corporations this time compared with the 1,217 that replied in 2007. </p> <p>Paul Dickinson, chief executive of the CDP - which was developed to help investors understand their financial exposure to global warming - said: \"With increased regulation on the horizon, investors are requiring this information to better understand the creditworthiness of companies in their portfolio and how climate change might affect their profitability.\" </p> <p>Global corporations view climate change as a clear risk as well as an opportunity. But they are anxious about the lack of clarity around government regulation, which they admit is holding back investment, Dickinson added.</p> <p>The only British companies in the top 12 rankings for a carbon disclosure index are Scottish and Southern, the gas and electricity utility, and the banking group Barclays. Others in the list include Japanese carmaker Nissan and the German chemicals group Bayer.</p>",
  "<p>Pakistan's political and military leadership, including the president and prime minister, had been due to dine at the Marriott hotel on the night of the devastating bombing, a minister claimed yesterday as a shadowy Islamist group claimed responsibility for the suicide blast in the capital.</p> <p>A group calling itself Fedayeen Islam (Partisans of Islam) last night said it carried out the bombing on Saturday which killed at least 53 people, and demanded that Pakistan end its alliance with the US. Earlier in the day the Pakistani Taliban had denied they were behind the blast.</p> <p>The claim was made to the Pakistan-based correspondent of the Arabiya television network. He received a text message which asked him to call a number. When he did, a recording in English, with a South Asian accent, took responsibility for the bombing in the name of Fedayeen Islam.</p> <p>Rehman Malik, the chief of Pakistan's interior ministry, said a dinner hosted by the speaker of the parliament for the government and military top brass had been planned at the Marriott on Saturday, but security fears led to a change. \"At the eleventh hour the dinner was shifted to the prime minster's house, which saved Pakistan's entire military and political leadership,\" Malik said. </p> <p>Malik's revelation was disputed by the management of the hotel, which said no such booking had been made. Whatever the truth, the bombing appeared to signal a new phase in the militants' war against the state, with the country feeling as if it is sliding towards chaos. \"Pakistan is teetering on the brink,\" said Farzana Shaikh, associate research fellow at Chatham House. \"There is a weak and deeply divided government and a disorientated army with no clear strategy.\"</p> <p>Many Pakistanis believe the sophistication and reach of extremist groups is the result of the army's past patronage of jihadists to fight proxy wars in Afghanistan and India. It is these groups, rather than the Pakistani Taliban in the north-west fringe, that may be most deeply linked to al-Qaida's agenda of global jihad. Groups such as Harkatul Jehadul Islami, led by Qari Saifullah, and Lashkar-e-Taiba appear to have gone rogue, having been nurtured by the ISI intelligence agency for years. There are fears that sympathisers in the ISI and army continue to help such groups, possibly providing the military explosives used in the Marriott blast.</p> <p>Benazir Bhutto accused Saifullah, once described by the former president Pervez Musharraf as al-Qaida's commander in Pakistan, of plotting to kill her just before she died, but he remains at liberty.</p> <p>\"Osama bin Laden's involvement with Pakistani militant organisations was very well established even before 9/11,\" said Muhammad Amir Rana, director of the Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies, a thinktank in Islamabad. \"Al-Qaida usually operates through them in this region.\"</p> <p>Pakistan's president, Asif Ali Zardari, arrived in the US yesterday for talks with George Bush. Analysts believe he will try to convince Washington to ease the pressure on his government. Recent US missile strikes in the tribal area have stoked anti-US feeling in the country.</p> <p>There was further evidence of the disorder gripping Pakistan yesterday. A suicide bombing at a checkpoint in the valley of Swat, in the north-west, killed five police officers. The Afghan consul-general in Peshawar was taken hostage after his car was sprayed with bullets, killing his driver. Meanwhile, there were reports from the tribal territory that Pakistani troops and tribesmen had fired on two US army helicopters, forcing them to retreat.</p>",

  "<p>The renationalisation of the electricity and gas industry was put back on the Labour agenda by a former minister and a union chief yesterday in the wake of rises of up to 35% on fuel bills and soaring profits by the companies.</p> <p>Michael Meacher, the former environment minister, and Tony Woodley, joint general secretary of the biggest union, Unite, received cheers from the conference floor when they demanded public ownership should return.</p> <p>Meacher asked: \"Is this government on the side of big business or is it on the side of the fuel poor? If privatisation of energy is going to lead to this massive exploitation and stuff the consumer, then yes we should be thinking again about having a public sector role in our energy sector.\"</p> <p>Woodley said: \"If they [the power companies] still don't get the message, this government should consider taking these essential industries - gas, electricity, water - back under public ownership.\"</p> <p>And he added, in reference to the nationalisation of Northern Rock: \"If it's good enough for the banks, it's good enough for our utilities.\"</p> <p>While delegates gave a standing ovation to the chancellor, Alistair Darling, much of the direction of the party's policy agenda was set immediately afterwards as the conference voted to approve motions put forward in a deal by the three biggest unions, Unite, Unison and the GMB.</p> <p>The motions mean the party's policy forum will have to examine a windfall tax on power companies, a price cap and new price controls by a tougher regulator for the industry, action on excessive bonuses for business directors and a leap in equal pay for women in the public sector. </p> <p>The GMB also succeeded in getting through a motion committing the party to ending Britain's opt-out of the working time directive, making it illegal to work more than 40 hours a week. But party officials said this was overruled by another motion which accepts that only abuses under the working time directive will be remedied by the government.</p> <p>However, the union victory was aimed not at ministers but at Labour and Socialist MEPs in Strasbourg who will have to vote on Britain's opt-out in December. They are hoping the European parliament will vote to block the opt-out.</p> <p>The union rhetoric on all these issues was strong. Derek Simpson, joint general secretary of Unite, told the conference on bonuses: \"Alistair, these people want ordinary people to share their pain but they won't share their gain. If you can't regulate the bonus culture, then tax it out of existence.\"</p> <p>Paul Kenny, general secretary of the GMB, said: \"Gordon, tackling speculators who damage our country for greed is popular. Standing up for our citizens against an unregulated dash-for-cash by energy companies is a vote-winner.\"</p> <p>Dave Prentis, general secretary of Unison, said: \"The right thing to do is to levy a windfall tax now on those energy companies that have made those huge profits to lift people out of debt.\"</p>",
  "<p>John Stewart was living in south London six years ago when two things happened that seriously affected his health. \"First the flight paths were changed so planes passed over my flat every 90 seconds. Then a nearby laundry centralised all its activities into one site, so the noise of the machines permeated the whole block. They were going all day and during the night,\" he says.</p> <p>\"I had to have the radio and TV on, even if I didn't want to, just so I didn't have to hear the outside noise. My sleep became interrupted and I ended up getting heart palpitations. My doctor said my blood pressure was too high, he was very worried about my heart, and I needed to take some serious action to reduce the stress before it killed me.\" After Stewart moved house, he slowly got better.</p> <p>There is growing evidence that noise-related stress is a significant public health hazard. According to a report from the World Health Organisation, unwanted noise is causing hearing impairment including tinnitus, disturbing our sleep and triggering stress hormones which could in turn affect the immune system and metabolism. </p> <p>It also makes us feel helpless and more aggressive and increases the chances of having a heart attack or stroke, accounting for an estimated 3% of ischeamic heart disease (the most common cause of death in the EU) in Europe. \"There is increasing evidence that air and road traffic noise might be related to high blood pressure,\" says Stephen Stansfeld, professor of psychiatry at Barts and the London School of Medicine. \"Exposure in school to aircraft noise is also linked to reading impairment in children.\"</p> <p>Another study, by Cornell University in New York, found that workers in an open-plan office with constant exposure to hubbub from machinery, telephones and office chatter had higher levels of adrenaline in their urine than workers in a quiet, self-contained work station. The open-plan group were also less effective at puzzle solving than the quiet group, who slept better, had better digestion, and were less irritable.</p> <p>\"When people get annoyed by noise they get stressed,\" says Stewart, who went on to set up the National Noise Association pressure group. \"Constant exposure to even moderate levels of noise can be harmful. One Austrian study showed that children living on a main road had shorter concentration spans than those who didn't.\"</p> <p>Small wonder then that noise is slowly inching up the political agenda. Last year, EU law required all European cities with populations of more than 250,000 to produce digitised noise maps. \"People think that we should 'live and let live' and only old people complain about noise,\" says Richard Tur, one of a growing number of anti-noise activists and founder of the US organisation NoiseOFF. \"But we need to change our perception of what noise actually is - unwanted sound which can be physically harmful.\"</p> <p>The big offenders, says Stewart, are loud music, aircraft and traffic, and the problem seems to be getting worse. One report from Sheffield Hallam University showed that some parts of Sheffield were up to 10 times noisier than 10 years previously while the UK Office of National Statistics suggests that noise complaints have increased fivefold in the past 20 years. </p> <p>Short of joining the half a million people who moved home in 2006 to escape a distressing din, here's our guide to surviving noisy Britain.</p> <h2>Take control </h2> <p>Not feeling in control of a situation significantly increases stress. Stansfeld says it is important to take action such as complaining about the noise.</p> <h2>Change your perception</h2> <p>A study funded by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs found that CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) and hypnotherapy helped reduce stress in those disturbed by low-frequency noise such as the low rumble of distant traffic, or the hum from an electric generator. \"CBT is partly about enabling people to control the thing that is bugging them, rather than it controlling them,\" says noise and vibration consultant Dr Geoff Leventhall, who conducted the study. \"Try the following exercise: Visualise the noise as a big black ball. Move it around, nearer, further away, or change its colour and size if you want, and explode it. The point is to take control of whatever is worrying you.\"</p> <p>Trying to change your perception of the situation is particularly helpful if the culprit is moderate noise which doesn't distress others (20-30% of the UK population are thought to be particularly noise-sensitive). \"The meaning of noise is very important,\" says Stansfeld. \"If you are lonely then hearing other people's parties can be upsetting. Airbases that emphasise their positive benefits to the local community are more warmly received than those that don't.\" To take part in the second stage of the study, go to <a href=\"http://www.copingwithnoise.org\">copingwithnoise.org</a>.</p> <h2>Focus on 'flow' activities</h2> <p>Doing things that are so enjoyable and absorbing that we lose sense of time may also distract from moderate noise. \"A difficult crossword, perhaps, a favourite hobby, or reading or watching something gripping,\" suggests Stewart.</p> <h2>Learn relaxation techniques</h2> <p>\"Anything that relaxes you will also help,\" says Leventhall, who recommends this meditative technique: \"Sit in a comfortable chair and repeat 'peace' or 'one', for example, with each exhalation, for 10 or 20 minutes every day. The body responds with a dramatic decrease in heart rate, breathing rate, blood pressure (if elevated to begin with), and metabolic rate - the exact opposite of the fight-or-flight response.\"</p> <h2>Block it out</h2> <p>\"For noisy streets, try thermal double glazing\", says John Hinton, president of the Institute of Acoustics, or try secondary glazing, adding an extra window pane four inches or so inside the existing double-glazed window. \"Reduce aircraft noise by increasing the sound insulation of the loft, and put up fencing to reduce traffic noise.\" </p> <p>And noisy neighbours? \"Increase the mass of the dividing wall or the floor by adding another layer of plasterboard,\" says Hinton. Push for \"low-noise road surfaces\" from local authorities and fit 'low-noise tyres\" to cars. Soft foam earplugs marginally reduce noise (the equivalent of standing in the next room) and office din can be neutralised with noise-maskers such as ChatterBlocker software (<a href=\"http://www.chatterblocker.com\">chatterblocker.com</a>).

Other noise-busting tips can be found at <a href=\"http://www.noiseoff.org\">noiseoff.org</a>.</p> <h2>Protect yourself</h2> <p>Not all noise-related health risks come from other people. DIY, concerts, clubs and listening to iPods are common causes of ear damage such as tinnitus, says David Baguley, director of audiology at Cambridge University Hospitals.</p> <p>Party animals should protect their ears by not mixing music with intoxication (\"smoking and drinking both affect the protective mechanism of the inner ear,\" says Baguley), wearing Etymotic earplugs at gigs (\"they reduce sound but keep music exciting\") and taking 10 minutes out of every hour exposed to loud music. \"Ditch the earphones that come with iPods,\" he adds, \"and invest in noise-cancelling headphones.\" These muffle unwanted noise so you can enjoy music at lower volumes. Finally, for noisy DIY, use ear-defenders (acoustic ear muffs).</p> <h2>Spend time in quiet places</h2> <p>Finally, buck the trend of the 22% of all Londoners who, according to one poll, had not experienced silence in over six months. \"There is evidence to show that finding peace and quiet can help people physically, emotionally and mentally,\" says Stewart.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The Noise Association's guide, <a href=\"http://www.thequietguide.co.uk\">thequietguide.co.uk</a>.

  "<p>A Ugandan government official who received bribes from a British company director yesterday became the first person to be convicted of overseas corruption since Britain tightened up its anti-bribery laws. Ananias Tumukunde, a 31-year-old adviser to Uganda's president, Yoweri Museveni, was jailed for a year at Southwark crown court. Niels Tobiasen, the 65-year-old managing director of a Wiltshire-based firm, has pleaded guilty to paying \u00a380,000 in bribes and is due to be sentenced on Friday. </p> <p>Tobiasen's firm had been given a contract to protect world leaders, including the Queen and Gordon Brown, at a Commonwealth heads of government meeting in Kampala last November. </p> <p>Judge James Wadsworth told Tumukunde, who was arrested when he came to Britain for medical treatment, that he had \"dishonestly pocketed\" the backhanders, adding: \"What you did is serious.\" </p> <p>The British government signed up to a global anti-bribery treaty in 1997, and in 2002 outlawed the payment of bribes by British companies to officials and politicians abroad to secure contracts. But the government has been criticised by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, which polices the treaty, for its poor record in prosecuting offenders. Anti-corruption campaigners who criticised the decision to terminate the Serious Fraud Office investigation into alleged bribery of Saudis by BAE, Britain's biggest arms company, gave yesterday's conviction a guarded welcome. Nick Hildyard, of Corner House, said: \"It's a good start, but there's still a long way to go. Other countries have not shied away from taking on the big companies.\"</p> <p>In May last year, Tobiasen's firm, CBRN, was given a \u00a3210,000 contract by the Ugandan government to supply training and equipment to guard the Commonwealth meeting, attended by 50 world leaders and 4,000 delegates. David Whittaker, prosecuting, told the court that a month later, Tumukunde went to CBRN's offices and demanded extra payments for what he called \"local tax\". He told Tobiasen that the payments were \"common\" in Uganda. The contract was one of six worth a total of \u00a3500,000 that were given to the company. By February this year, Tobiasen had sent five payments worth \u00a383,000 to Tumukunde and a Ugandan military officer, Rusoke Tagaswire, who is still wanted by police. </p> <p>Detectives from the City of London police learned of the payments and arrested Tobiasen on April 2. </p> <p>The following day, Tumukunde was arrested at Heathrow. At first he denied that the payments were bribes, but yesterday he pleaded guilty. Rupert Pardoe, defending, said the amount that Tumukunde had actually received was about \u00a312,000, which he was going to give to his ill mother. The judge recommended that Tumukunde be deported after finishing his sentence.</p> <p>Yesterday's conviction was secured by the overseas corruption unit of the City of London police, set up 18 months ago. The business secretary, John Hutton, said: \"The UK performs well on tackling corruption compared to our closest competitors, but we can still do more ... Next year, we will propose important law reforms to strengthen our crackdown on the companies who pay bribes and foreign officials who take them.\"</p>",
  "<p>Alistair Darling dropped a broad hint yesterday that tax increases or spending restraint would eventually be needed to deal with the surge in public borrowing caused by a slowing economy. The chancellor said he would allow the government's deficit to rise in the short term, to cushion the blow to growth from the credit crunch and higher inflation, but warned that all countries had to \"live within their means\".</p> <p>In a sober analysis of the economic outlook, he said Britain was facing \"real problems\", although he insisted that the underlying strength of the economy was a reason for long-term optimism.</p> <p>The chancellor will use his annual pre-budget report in November to slash Treasury forecasts that growth will be 2% this year and 2.5% next year. He will also raise his forecasts for public borrowing, and outline medium-term plans to bring the public finances back under control.</p> <p>In his keynote speech to the party conference, Darling said he was allowing borrowing to rise during the downturn in order to \"support the economy and families when they need it most\".</p> <p>But with some analysts predicting that the budget deficit could hit \u00a390bn, as Britain suffers its first recession since the early 1990s, he warned that there were tough decisions on tax and spending ahead.</p> <p>\"Make no mistake, discipline in public finances is essential ... In the medium term, governments everywhere have to live within their means, so I will set out this autumn how I will continue to deliver sound public finances.\"</p> <p>Darling is also expected to use his PBR address to acknowledge that the financial turmoil has made it necessary for the government to breach its fiscal rules - to borrow only for investment over the economic cycle and to keep public debt below 40% of GDP.</p> <p>He will use his Mais lecture in the City next month to explain how fiscal policy should respond to financial crises.</p> <p>The chancellor said the global financial system would \"never be the same\" after the turmoil of the year-long crisis. \"These are extraordinary, turbulent times. A crisis which has rocked the financial institutions around the world on top of huge rises in oil, food and commodity prices.\"</p> <p>He said the government had been right to respond to the crisis by taking Northern Rock into public ownership, and by introducing legislation to make it easier to intervene if other banks ran into problems. The Bank of England had been authorised to inject more than \u00a3100bn to help stabilise the UK banking system. \"We are on a difficult road and there will, I am afraid, be bumps along the way. But I will continue to do whatever it takes to maintain financial stability, and I remain confident we will do so.\"</p> <p>The chancellor plans to introduce a new banking bill to the Commons within a fortnight, designed to strengthen supervision and give added powers to financial regulators. He would work with the new chairman of the Financial Services Authority, Lord Turner, to \"review urgently what we need to do to improve the system\".</p> <p>\"It is not a question of light-touch regulation against heavy-handed regulation. It's about effective regulation,\" Darling said. \"I can promise that wherever weaknesses are found in the financial system, whether in the powers of the government, the Bank of England or the FSA, I will take steps to deal with it.\"</p> <p>He added: \"We need to look as well at the culture of huge bonuses which have distorted the way decisions are made. Bonuses should encourage good long-term decisions, not short-term reckless ones.\" The chancellor believes the FSA should use existing powers to clamp down on companies where high bonuses have created incentives for traders to take excessive risks.</p> <p>Over the next few weeks both he and the prime minister would discuss with their international counterparts the measures needed to prevent future \"mistakes and misjudgments\".</p> <p>Inflation, he said, was too high. But the Bank of England believed it would peak soon and should fall over the next year.</p> <p>Ahead of the pre-budget report in the autumn, Darling stressed the need for discipline in public finances, while hailing Labour's record in taking the \"right long-term decisions\" for the economy.</p> <h2>I told you so...</h2> <p>In his speech to the Labour party conference, Alistair Darling referred to his comment in a recent Guardian interview that the global economy was facing its most challenging time in 60 years. At the time, his comments were widely derided as being unduly pessimistic. But that was before last week's banking crisis. \"I've made headlines by saying just how tough times are,\" said the chancellor yesterday. \"I draw little comfort from the fact that many people now understand what I meant.\"</p>",
  "<p>The result came as a surprise to some, yet the clue was there all along. Who is Labour's greatest party hero?</p> <p>With hindsight it was blindingly obvious how delegates at the Manchester conference would answer the Guardian's question: it was in the first names. David Blunkett revealed his third son was named after Keir. \"So is mine. My son is called Keir,\" said the historian and Labour peer Kenneth Morgan. It didn't stop there.</p> <p>The idea was simple. Instead of staging the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2008/sep/22/labour.labourconference1\">Guardian's annual debate</a> on the fringe, speakers would make the case for one of four heroes - including one heroine - shortlisted in a ballot of Labour MPs.</p> <p>So <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/19/labour.labourconference\">Blunkett spoke up for Clem Attlee</a>, prime minister during the postwar construction of the welfare state. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/19/labour.labourconference2\">Ed Balls championed Aneurin Bevan</a>, master architect of the NHS. Fiona Mactaggart MP extolled <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/19/labourconference.labour\">Barbara Castle</a>, feminist pioneer, while <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/19/labour.labourconference1\">Morgan praised Keir Hardie</a>, the party's saintly founder a century ago. In a crowded lunchtime hall the protagonists made their pitch. Attlee is a \"head over heart\" candidate, said Blunkett, the quiet man who delivered: he turned Hardie's socialist vision into action. Not enough, said Balls. Bevan was an orator, a miner risen - like Hardie - from great poverty to create Labour's most enduring institution. More than that, he continues to inspire.</p> <p>\"Where are the Hardie-ites or the Attlee-ites?\" he asked before making one of this week's bolder claims. \"Tony Blair and Gordon Brown are both proud to be Bevanites.\"</p> <p>Such talk was too much for rival teams. Blunkett recalled Nye Bevan had walked out of Attlee's cabinet, a \"cop-out\" that helped Labour to election defeat. A mistake, Balls conceded. \"I don't think Bevan was a Bevanite,\" not a splitter like his disciples, he argued. But Bevan was a centraliser, a nationaliser, said Ken Morgan whereas Hardie was a localiser who thought the democracy in \"democratic socialism\" as important as the socialism. History has vindicated him, Lord Morgan said. Fiona Mactaggart, a late substitute for Patricia Hewitt, felt her task was harder. Many in the room knew Barbara and had felt the lash of her tongue. As a woman she been a groundbreaking pioneer like Hardie, whereas rival candidates had stood on Hardie's shoulders.</p> <p>\"If she'd done that they'd have been looking up her skirt.\" Look up Barbara's skirt, asked Blunkett? \"She'd have kneed you in the groin.\" But Mactaggart made a strong case, supported by some women in the audience. </p> <p>Equal pay, road safety, overseas aid, multi-tasking Castle had been their tireless role model. She did not win all her battles but she did fight them. </p> <p>But Morgan's knowledge and quiet authority was building a powerful case. In Victorian England Hardie (1856-1915) was a feminist, democrat, republican in Milton mould, a visionary anti-imperialist and civil libertarian, \"a force of moral greatness\", a Nelson Mandela for his time. So when debate chairman, Polly Toynbee, called for show of hands it was over the moment she said \"Hardie\". He won by 130 votes to Bevan's 42, 33 for Castle, 29 for \"head over heart\" Attlee. </p> <p>A brief respite from the global financial crisis, it was a day for hearts. Gone for ever is the wicked canard that New Labour thinks Keir is just a drink for a summer's evening.</p>",
  "<p>'You can always rely on the US to do the right thing,\" quipped Winston Churchill, \"once it has exhausted the alternatives.\" That is indeed why Friday's market euphoria at the US Treasury's financial rescue plan was justified: launching a rescue was the right thing to do, and the good thing about the US is that it has done it quickly, about 13 months after the credit crunch began - rather than taking seven or eight years, as Japan did after its own crunch in the 1990s. </p> <p>Perhaps it takes a free market, wild-west capitalist system to know when the sheriff should be called in. Anyone wishing to see this market turmoil as somehow the denouement of deregulated \"finance capitalism\", the end of Thatcher-Reaganism, and proof that regulated systems work better, needs to take account of Japan, the world's second largest economy and home of the other great 1930s-style financial crash of recent decades. </p> <p>Japan's banking system collapsed in the 90s, and its once-brilliant bureaucrat-regulators failed to act quickly to clean up the mess. So far, the US - helped, no doubt, by the chance to learn from Japan's example - is doing better.</p> <p>But the rapture about the US needs some modification. The good news, both about the latest mega-rescue and the earlier nationalisation of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and AIG, is that the American government has shown that it is willing to assume responsibility for clearing up the bad debts. A safety net is thus now available to prevent more banks thudding into the ground. </p> <p>The bad news, however, is that preventing any more collapses will be far from easy. The problem is that it is unclear, in such situations, what a \"bad debt\" really is. In the 1980s, when the US government cleaned up after the collapse of its savings and loans industry (an equivalent of building societies), it took over bankrupt firms and sold their debt. This time, it is promising to buy bad debts from banks that are still active. It will have to set some sort of price, but also haggle over the definition of eligible debts. For when an economy is sliding into recession, as the US will probably now do, a debt that is good today can turn bad tomorrow.</p> <p>Consequently, no one can know how much money this rescue will cost. Numbers being bandied about range from $700bn to $1 trillion, though generally with a cheery caveat attached that the federal government could even end up making a profit by taking on bad debts and later selling them. In no calculation of the cost of this venture should that be counted upon. After all, if it looked a good bet, other governments presiding over sliding housing markets, including the UK's, would be rushing to offer their own plans to buy up dud mortgage debt. They aren't - though probably some will have to before this affair is over.</p> <p>No doubt the violent mood swings in financial markets we saw last week will return at some point: new black holes will be found or suspected, and more institutions will be brought to the brink of collapse. But the US action does mark a turning point, as long as neither the White House nor Congress decides to renege on the promises to provide a safety net.</p> <p>From this point, the right questions will centre on the consequences for fiscal policy and national debt, rather than on banking as such. Right at the outset of the credit crunch, in August last year, the International Monetary Fund's then new boss, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, called for a big fiscal expansion to try to support the global economy. Finally, he is going to get his way - but not in quite the form he expected.</p> <p>There has been much hyperactive talk about how vast the US rescue plan is, and how earth-shattering will be the extension of government that it represents. This is misleading: the rescue is indeed very large, but so is the American economy. The federal government is already in debt to the tune of $5.4 trillion, which sounds impossibly large if you don't realise that the US's annual GDP is nearly $14 trillion. This isn't Italy, in other words: there is room to add another few trillion to the debt.</p> <p>The annual cost on the budget deficit in the first year could be $700bn, larger even than the impact of the Iraq war. But that, too, is misleading if you don't realise that the US federal deficit currently is less than 3% of GDP - smaller than Britain's (3.8%). Similarly, this extra debt is unlikely, of itself, to lead to a new decline in the dollar, as some have predicted: the dollar might fall in value relative to other currencies, but only if the US economy goes into a deep and prolonged recession, which is what the rescue plan meant to avert.</p> <p>No, the true impact of this expansion of public spending lies in politics, and in what this rescue will now make more difficult or perhaps impossible: the expansion of other areas of public spending, such as healthcare or public programmes for alternative energy. If Barack Obama is elected president in November, he will find his fiscal hands tied a lot tighter than he may have hoped, even with a Democratic Congress alongside him - unless, of course, he wants to raise taxes.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Bill Emmott is a former editor of the Economist and the author of Rivals: How the Power Struggle between China, India and Japan will Shape our Next Decade. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:bill@billemmott.com\">bill@billemmott.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Does Moore's law now apply to human civilisation? In 1965 Gordon Moore observed that the density of transistors on integrated circuits doubles every two years or so, and predicted this would continue. Similar laws now seem to apply to every aspect of computing. And, perhaps, to the rest of the world. The information available, the scale of human interactions, the detail involved in financial deals and trading relationships and political decisions appear to be growing exponentially. We are drowning in complexity. To be good citizens we must understand what is done in our name. But how?</p> <p>We lean ever more heavily on experts. But who can we now trust? Corporate PR has become so sophisticated that it's almost impossible for most people to tell the difference between genuine science and greenwash, or real grassroots campaigns and the astroturf lobbies concocted by consultants. PR companies set up institutes with impressive names which publish what purport to be scientific papers, sometimes in the font and format of genuine journals. They accuse real scientists of every charge that could be levelled at themselves: junk science, hidden funding, undisclosed interests and inflated credentials. </p> <p>If journalists have any remaining function, it is to help people navigate this world: to try to understand the crushingly dull documents that most people don't have time for, to smoke out the fakes and show how to recognise the genuine article. But we mess up too. The most we can promise is to try not to make the same mistake twice. </p> <p>So what can you say about a man who makes the same mistake 38 times? Who, when confronted by a mountain of evidence demonstrating that his informant is a charlatan convicted under the Trade Descriptions Act, continues to repeat his claims? Who elevates the untested claims of bloggers above peer-reviewed papers? Who sticks to his path through a blizzard of facts? What should we deduce about the Sunday Telegraph's columnist Christopher Booker?</p> <p>This week Richard Wilson's book Don't Get Fooled Again is published. It contains a fascinating chapter on Booker's claims about white asbestos. Since 2002, he has published 38 articles on this topic, and every one of them is wrong. He champions the work of John Bridle, who has described himself as \"the world's foremost authority on asbestos science\". Bridle has claimed to possess an honorary professorship from the Russian Academy of Sciences, to be a consultant to an institute at the University of Glamorgan, the chief asbestos consultant for an asbestos centre in Lisbon, and a consultant to Vale of Glamorgan trading standards department. None of these claims is true. Neither the institute at the University of Glamorgan nor the centre in Lisbon have ever existed. His only relationship with the Glamorgan trading standards department is to have been successfully prosecuted by it for claiming a qualification he does not possess. </p> <p>None of this deters Mr Booker. Armed with Bridle's claims, for the past six years he has waged a campaign against asbestos science. White asbestos cement, he maintains \"poses no measurable risk to health\". He contends that \"not a single case\" of mesothelioma - the cancer caused by exposure to asbestos - \"has ever been scientifically linked with asbestos cement\". A paper commissioned by the UK's Health and Safety Executive, he says, \"concluded that the risk from white asbestos is 'virtually zero'\".</p> <p>Booker tells me he has read this paper. Oh yes? The term he quotes - \"virtually zero\" - does not appear in it. It does show that white asbestos (chrysotile) is less dangerous than brown or blue asbestos. But, while there is uncertainty about the numbers, it still presents a risk of mesothelioma, which depends on the level of exposure. People exposed to a high dose (between 10 and 100 fibres per millilitre per year (f/ml.yr)) have a risk (around two deaths per 100,000 for each f/ml.yr) of contracting this cancer. Only when the dose falls to less than 0.1 f/ml.yr does it become \"probably insignficant\". But Booker's columns contain no such caveat. He creates the impression that white asbestos is safe at all doses. The paper he misquotes also cites five scientific studies of exposure to asbestos cement, which record \"high levels of mesothelioma mortality\". </p> <p>Two years ago, John Bridle's misleading CV and dodgy record were exposed by the BBC's You and Yours programme. So the BBC immediately became part of the conspiracy: in Booker's words \"a concerted move by the powerful 'anti-asbestos lobby' to silence Bridle\". He suggested that the broadcasting regulator Ofcom would clear Bridle's name. In June this year it threw out Bridle's complaint and published evidence even more damning than that contained in the programme. So has Booker changed the way he sees \"Britain's leading practical asbestos expert\"? Far from it. He tells me that \"my view of Ofcom has plummeted\": it too has joined the conspiracy. </p> <p>We are not talking about trivia here. This is a matter of life and death. How many people might have been exposed to dangerous levels of asbestos dust as a result of reading and believing Booker's columns? </p> <p>For several years he has been waging a similar war against \"warmist alarmists\", by which he means climate scientists. Nine days ago, for instance, he attacked Michael Mann for publishing a paper that shows (alongside scores of other studies) that global temperatures do indeed follow the famous hockey-stick pattern: a moderate long-term cooling trend terminating in a sudden upward bend. Mann, Booker told his readers, had been \"selective ... in his new data, excluding anything which confirmed the Medieval Warming\". But Mann's paper, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, uses every uncluttered high-resolution proxy temperature record in the public domain. How did Booker trip up so badly? By using the claims of unqualified bloggers to refute peer-reviewed studies.</p> <p>Under their guidance he routinely mistakes weather for climate and makes claims about the temperature record that bear no relation to the studies he cites. My favourite Booker column is the piece he wrote in February, titled \"So it appears that Arctic ice isn't vanishing after all\". In September 2007, he reported, \"sea ice cover had shrunk to the lowest level ever recorded. But for some reason the warmists are less keen on the latest satellite findings, reported by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ... Its graph of northern hemisphere sea ice area, which shows the ice shrinking from 13,000 million sq km to just 4 million from the start of 2007 to October, also shows it now almost back to 13 million sq km\". To reinforce this point, he helpfully republished the graph, showing that the ice had indeed expanded between September and January. The Sunday Telegraph continues to employ a man who cannot tell the difference between summer and winter. </p> <p>But for the Wikipedia Professor of Gibberish, this patron saint of charlatans, even the seasons are negotiable. Booker remains right, whatever the evidence says. It is hard to think of any journalist - Melanie Phillips included - who has spread more misinformation. The world becomes even harder to navigate. You cannot trust the people who tell you whom to trust.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com\">www.monbiot.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Sallie Krawcheck, one of the most powerful women on Wall Street, has become the latest high profile banker to stand down amid the turmoil rattling the financial markets.</p> <p>Krawcheck, 43, who earned $11m at Citigroup last year, had once been considered a potential candidate to run the bank. </p> <p>She is leaving as part of a restructuring designed to get the firm back into profitability. Citigroup has lost $17.4bn in the past three quarters, largely through exposure to soured mortgages.</p> <p>Krawcheck currently runs Citigroup's wealth management division, which is being brought under its institutional clients business. The bank said she is leaving \"to pursue other opportunities\".</p> <p>Krawcheck joins a growing roll call of senior executives on Wall Street to have left their jobs in the crisis that reached crescendo last week.</p> <p>Her former boss, Charles Prince at Citigroup, Stan O'Neal, the former chief executive of Merrill Lynch and James Cayne at Bear Stearns all stood down in quick succession around the turn of the year.</p> <p>The ranks of senior women on Wall Street have been especially thinned. Erin Callan, the former chief financial officer at the now bankrupt Lehman Brothers was replaced in June and Morgan Stanley co-president Zoe Cruz left in December after 25 years with the firm. Credit Suisse hired Callan the following month to run its hedge funds business.</p> <p>Michael Corbat, becomes head of the wealth management business and Krawcheck will remain as chairman of the division for three months to help in the hand over. Edward Kelly is taking over the global banking division, which includes the investment bank and the commercial bank.</p> <p>Vikram Pandit, who replaced Prince as chief executive, has been restructuring Citigroup since he took the job in December. Among key appointments, he brought in his former colleague John Havens to run the firm's investment bank in March. Pandit said Krawcheck had been \"an invaluable asset\".</p> <p>Krawcheck was hired in 2002 to restore the reputation of its research division, Smith Barney, in the wake of a conflict of interest scandal. Two years later she was promoted to chief financial officer, but she went back to running wealth management, which includes Smith Barney as well as the private bank that caters to wealthy clients, in 2007. The move was widely seen as a backwards step for Krawcheck.</p> <p>She had previously been head of Sanford C Bernstein, an independent research firm.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama's campaign managers are nervous about foreign endorsements given the negative response of Americans, who understandably feel that the decision on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree+world/uselections2008\">November 4</a> should be theirs alone. </p> <p>British politicians, however, have no such qualms about endorsements that come in the opposite direction, and David Miliband was the lucky recipient of one this afternoon. I happened to watch his speech to the Labour party conference with a member of Obama's foreign policy team. When I asked for a reaction, the instant response \u2013 just like that of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/22/davidmiliband.labourconference\">Jonathan Freedland</a> \u2013 was: \"He reminds me of Obama.\"</p> <p>The reason, I was told, was not simply Miliband's knowing appropriation of \"hope\". It was also his easy manner, his confidence and his command of the speech. My suggestion that he couldn't match the Democratic candidate in terms of charisma was explained in terms of cultural difference: \"He's English.\" </p> <p>I suspect that domestic critics will be less forgiving in their judgment. As with last year's speech, there will be those who complain that his delivery lacked panache. I think this is unfair. Every politician is now compared to Blair, but he was a one-off. If Miliband lacks the showmanship of his old boss, so does anyone else, including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron\">David Cameron</a>. This is not how politicians should be judged. </p> <p>It is enough that the substance of Miliband's speech was good, both as a contribution to Labour's renewal as a party of social progress and in developing stronger and more effective attacks lines to use against the Conservatives. Particularly striking was his reference to the need to close the gap between rich and poor and the belief that Labour's mission was to tackle inequality and not just poverty. </p> <p>This was said in the context of international development, but in a way that suggested the need for a broader repositioning of Labour following the financial crisis and the resulting bonfire of economic orthodoxies. These are not thoughts that senior Labour figures have articulated for years. The old taboos are breaking down, and not before time.</p> <p>Miliband also has a clear sense of how the world is changing. He acknowledges the emerging world order as being multi-polar in character with the rise of China, India and Brazil as major powers. (Russia was a notable absence from the list, suggesting that Miliband has a sound appreciation of that country's underlying weaknesses). </p> <p>His prescription for how to respond to it is also correct: a more powerful European voice within a stronger transatlantic Alliance that is able to overcome the disagreements of the Bush era. The truth is that Europe and the United States are going to need each other more in the coming decades as the rising powers claim their rightful place within the international system. But the relationship will have to become better balanced if it is to survive. This requires a US leadership that is prepared to listen and compromise, and an EU that is willing and able to shoulder its responsibilities. Neither of these is assured, so the aim of British policy should be to bring them about.</p> <p>Finally, Miliband identified a real achilles heel in the Conservative approach, demanding as it does that Britain should continue to be a major force in global affairs while simultaneously cutting it off from its major allies in Europe. Whether it comes to tackling climate change, creating a more stable and just global economy or challenging Russian abuses as an energy supplier, the road to success runs through Brussels, where the policy levers and collective muscle of the EU can achieve results beyond the resources of even its largest member states. </p> <p>The changing distribution of world power will only make this more so, leaving the Conservatives increasingly exposed in their hostility to Europe. This ought to be a major theme of Labour's efforts to force greater scrutiny of David Cameron's policies.</p> <p>Although he would never say so, much of what <a href=\"https://blogs.fco.gov.uk/roller/miliband/\">Miliband</a> hopes for the world will be easier to achieve with Barack Obama in the White House, not least in respect of transatlantic unity. I also suspect that there will be another, more personal reason why the foreign secretary hopes for a Democratic win in six weeks. In terms of generation and style the compatibility is obvious. He may not be the English Obama, but he is a closer fit than anyone else.</p>",

But now the McCain campaign has a whole new set of potential character-based arguments in their candidate's favour, thanks to the Brazilian former beauty queen Maria Gracinda Teixeira de Jesus, who tells a newspaper that the young McCain was \"tasty, loving and romantic\" and \"good at everything\" in bed \u2014&#xa0;so good, in fact, that Ms Teixeira de Jesus, now 77, had to \"purchase a book which taught me how to kiss to keep up with him.\" She recalls: \"He was a lovely person and loved to go out with me. I called him 'John' but he was my dear and my coconut dessert.\" Indeed! Anyway, it surely can't be long before the campaign finds a way to capitalise on this news, which demonstrates that McCain is not just a fighter but also a lover \u2014 a man who, if all else fails, will simply romance the Dow Industrials Index back to new heights of intensity. According to unconfirmed reports, campaign manager Rick Davis is even now working on a press release based on some horrific Carry-On-style joke involving the phrase \"stimulus package\".

  "<p>The concept of a Wall Street investment bank was in its death throes today as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/morganstanley\">Morgan Stanley</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/goldmansachs\">Goldman Sachs</a> succumbed to a collapse in confidence in their financial stability by converting themselves into lower risk, tightly regulated commercial banks.</p> <p>Beset by plunging share prices and alarmed by the demise of competitors, the two remaining standalone Wall Street banks accepted licences from the Federal Reserve which allow them to take deposits from the public backed by federal government guarantees.</p> <p>While safeguarding customers' money, the change will radically restrict the firms' activities by imposing strict regulatory limits on the risks their traders can take on the markets and on the amount of money they can borrow. </p> <p>Morgan Stanley further shored up its financial position by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/22/wallstreet.morganstanley\">selling a stake of up to 20% in itself to Japan's Mitsubishi Financial Group</a> for an estimated $8bn to $9bn.</p> <p>Against a backdrop of an ongoing global financial crisis, the hurriedly agreed change in the two US banks' status happened without the usual 30-day waiting period for such applications. It came as Congress began scouring legislation to enact a $700bn government bail-out for banks through the creation of a state-sponsored body to suck up toxic, underperforming mortgage-backed assets.</p> <p>Goldman Sachs' chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, said his firm would be viewed as an \"even more secure institution\" under the new regime while Morgan Stanley's boss John Mack said it offered \"certainty about the strength of our financial position and our access to funding\".</p> <p>Only last week, both firms were vigorously defending the viability of their business models in spite of a sell-off which sent their stock plunging by 20% to 30% on consecutive days.</p> <p>They insist that unlike rivals such as Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns, they are profitable and suffering few financial problems. But insiders accept that the landscape has changed - once source said: \"Given the events of the last few months, particularly the last week, it's become very clear that the market places a premium on safety and certainty.\"</p> <p>The conversions end a chapter in US banking history which opened in 1933 when the Glass-Steagall act separated investment banking from high-street banking. Bill Isaac, a former chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, said it was the end of Wall Street banking as we know it.</p> <p>\"They're the only two left and the handwriting was on the wall,\" said Isaac. \"It's a shame because this country was built, in part, on risk-taking by Goldman and Morgan and by a whole bunch of firms before them.\"</p> <p>Analysts say the banks' new status will limit their ability to dabble in the types of exotic derivatives and credit instruments which contributed to the credit crunch. Banks' risks are generally judged by a leverage ratio of assets to borrowing. Morgan Stanley's ratio reached 33 last year and Goldman Sachs' touched 28 while high-street banks are typically in the low teens or below.</p> <p>David Williams, an analyst at Fox-Pitt Kelton in New York, said: \"The regulatory tide is moving against the investment banks. There are going to be higher levels of regulation, lower leverage ratios, greater scrutiny on what they do.\"</p> <p>Neither Goldman nor Morgan Stanley has immediate plans to open networks of high-street branches. Morgan Stanley already has about 300 branch offices and is expected to offer a broader range of services at the counter. </p> <p>Goldman intends to bid for deposits on a wholesale basis - for example, by stepping in to become custodian when local banks struggle in the US.</p> <p>Between them, the banks hold about $56bn of customers' deposits in their wealth management businesses for rich private clients which, as of today, are guaranteed by taxpayers' money.</p> <p>Bear Stearns' collapse in March was the beginning of the end for Wall Street's \"big five\" standalone investment banks. Lehman Brothers went bankrupt last week, although its US operation re-opened yesterday under Barclays' ownership. Merrill Lynch is set to be swallowed through a $50bn buyout by Bank of America.</p> <p>Alarmed by the speed of the industry's unravelling, the Bush administration is pushing for swift legislation on a $700bn bail-out plan. Democrats in Congress are fighting to insert measures in which would give the government a stake in banks benefiting from aid and would cap executive pay.</p> <p>Critics of the industry say the money ought to be used to help homeowners in danger of losing their houses. Bruce Marks, chief executive of the Neighbourhood Assistance Corporation of America, said: \"We are rewarding companies whose only motivation was greed. This is truly moral hazard bearing its ugly head.\"</p> <p>During early trading, Wall Street stocks were sharply down with the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing as much as 200 points. </p>",
  "<p>Walking around the careers fair at the <a href=\"http://www.nbmbaa.org/\">National Black MBA Association</a> <a href=\"http://www.eshow2000.com/nbmbaa/index.cfm\">leadership and business conference</a> in Washington last week, I had a Damascene moment. The sight of 20,000 impeccably suited and booted, scarily well-educated, professional, middle-class African-Americans (for the most part in possession of MBAs and PhDs) soothed and uplifted my soul.<br> As a black Briton, I'm not used to this kind of awe-inspiring sight. We simply do not have this on any comparable level back home. Much to my chagrin, Britain's black middle class is still woefully small (perhaps nascent is a more charitable description), and we have not yet reached the critical mass of black professionals to which this week's NBMBA conference is a testament. With its aim of fostering intellectual and creative wealth among black people in corporate America, the NBMBA, with current president Barbara Thomas at the helm, is a vital cornerstone in the edifice of black America. Empowering the community by dint of collective cohesion, support networks and clear business acumen, it is an organisation that not only helps black Americans endure \"the middle passage of soulless corporate America\" (as one delegate described it), but also seeks to give back to the community and lift up the next generation. Given the bigotry, prejudice and oppression that black Americans have endured in order to reach this stage, there is something miraculous and moving about the association this year celebrating its 30th anniversary. The opening night's gala dinner, with speeches by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Powell\">Colin Powell</a>, former US secretary of state, and basketball legend <a href=\"http://www.kareemabduljabbar.com/\">Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</a>, was indicative of the magnitude of the event. And at a time when an African-American is poised (albeit precariously) to become the nation's first black president, the conference's theme of being a \"catalyst for change\" seems scarily prescient.<br> But it is by no means all pomp and pageantry. The conference is primarily where tens of thousands of black graduates come to be recruited by A-list companies. Yemisi Emiola, a 31-year-old recruiter from Atlanta, described the conference as \"the single, largest and perhaps most important networking and employment opportunity for black candidates today.\"</p> <p>And despite the racially homogeneous nature of the event, the delegates here are incidentally black, unlike the consciously black counterparts they would have at a similar event in the UK. We have not yet reached the level at which people can afford to not be defined by their colour, as black high achievers outside the realms of sport and music in Britain are still painfully anomalous.<br> I am here in my capacity as a volunteer mentor and chaperone with a youth leadership scheme from Peckham, South London, which is affiliated with the <a href=\"http://www.nbmbaa.org/index.aspx?PageID=788\">Leaders of Tomorrow</a>, the NBMBA's junior division. Our students partake in leadership seminars, workshops, luncheons and tours of local universities, all with the purpose of nurturing and encouraging the next generation of black leaders.<br> Attending these conferences has without a doubt played a seminal role in the development of my own psyche, as well. Each seminar or keynote speech focuses on empowerment through education, and is often attached to a denunciation of the perennially seductive cult of instant gratification - a welcome antidote to the nefarious effects of bling culture and its concomitant litany of teenage murders. In addition, the mottos, mantras and inspirational stories advocating the importance of believing in oneself are by no means crude didacticism masquerading as florid sentiment. The razzmatazz is a potent pick-me-up, which, devoid of emotional solipsisms, creates a positive and uplifting environment in which delegates feel that they too can achieve their true potential. And that is precisely what I want for the young people I mentor. This is what black Americans do best. The plenary meetings, the keynote luncheons, the gala dinners, the modern jazz music piped around the venue - it's as slick and efficient an operation as a chocolate bar popping out of a vending machine. And all this in the self-proclaimed <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/library/dc/dc6898/funk.htm\">Chocolate City</a>.<br> There is little doubt that middle-class black America is 30-40 years ahead of us back in Blighty. That's why walking into the careers fair here is both humbling and inspiring in equal measure. It might not be the panacea for all our ills, but we urgently need associations like the NBMBA to weave their professional magic and give sustenance to our undernourished black British souls.  In short, the conference is the living embodiment of the mantra that I tell my young people from London ad nauseam: \"We need much less Notorious BIG and much more prestigious PhD.\" And here in Washington, that is precisely what they are getting. So it goes without saying that I'll be bringing my students to next year's conference in New Orleans for some more rejuvenating, life-affirming chicken soup for the soul.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown's two most senior cabinet colleagues hailed his leadership today ahead of the prime minister's crucial speech at the Labour conference.</p> <p>Alistair Darling, the chancellor, praised Brown's experience and judgment while David Miliband, the foreign secretary and the man tipped as Brown's most likely successor, used his Manchester conference speech to praise the prime minister's influence on the global stage.</p> <p>While they were the latest in a long line of ministers to praise Brown at the Labour conference over the last three days, their interventions helped lower some of the temperature ahead of Brown's speech tomorrow afternoon. It nonetheless remains the most important speech of his career and could still determine whether he remains as prime minister.</p> <p>Miliband, the young pretender to the premiership, did just about enough to fulfill Brown's hope for loyalty. He urged Labour to \"defeat fatalism and replace it with hope\", and claimed \"an age of massive change needs leadership from a party dedicated to change\".</p> <p>The foreign secretary's carefully chosen words immediately raised suspicions among some commentators, who claimed he was purposely leaving his door open to offers. But Miliband later told Sky News he was \"not in favour of a leadership election\".</p> <p>All eyes will be on the prime minister when he delivers his keynote speech and attempts to reassert his authority over the Labour party with what his team believes will be a bold vision for government in the months ahead.</p> <p>Tonight will be spent putting the finishing touches to a text he began writing in August and which has been virtually complete for weeks.</p> <p>Darling's speech, competently if not dazzlingly delivered, coupled careful assurances there would not be a knee-jerk reaction to the financial crisis with a clear statement of loyalty to the prime minister. The two men, close allies, have nonetheless had strained spells in recent months, not least after Darling declared in a Guardian interview that the economic conditions were the worst for 60 years.</p> <p>Darling said today: \"These are very uncertain times. But one thing I am certain about is that we have the right prime minister, the right team and the right policies to help the country through them, a prime minister with experience and judgment who has helped deliver a decade of rising living standards.\"</p> <p>The chancellor dropped a broad hint that tax increases or spending restraint would eventually be needed to deal with the surge in public borrowing caused by a slowing economy.</p> <p>Darling said he would allow the government's deficit to rise in the short term to cushion the impact of the credit crunch and higher inflation, but warned that all countries had to \"live within their means\".</p> <p>Amid continued off-stage chatter and argument about the prime minister's position, Peter Mandelson, one of the chief architects of New Labour, remained silent when asked if he was backing Brown.</p> <p>The two have been at the centre of bitter feuding dating back to 1994, when Mandelson backed Tony Blair and not Brown for the Labour leadership. Today, at a conference fringe meeting, the former minister remained tight-lipped about Labour's internal party problems.</p> <p>But Lord Kinnock, the former Labour leader, was among those who rallied to the prime minister's aide, criticising the \"infantile\" conduct of Brown's critics and accusing them of forgetting the lessons of the 1970s and 1980s, when Labour was riven by ferocious infighting.</p>",

Global warming does not mean that each year will be warmer than the last.\"</p> <p>The new research confirms that the world has cooled slightly since 2005, but says this is down to a weather phenomenon called La Ni\u00f1a, when cold water rises to the surface of the Pacific Ocean. Despite this effect, the office says, 11 of the last 13 years are the warmest ever recorded.</p> <p>Vicky Pope of the Met Office said the new research was in response to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/may/03/climatechange.greenpolitics\">high-profile claims made by Lawson</a> the former chancellor, and others that the recent cooling showed that fears of climate change are overblown, and that temperatures are unlikely to rise as high as predicted. </p> <p>She said: \"I think it has confused people. We got a lot of emails asking whether global warming had stopped and it prompted us to look at the data again and try and understand the situation better.\"</p> <p>The apparent cooling trend is exaggerated by a record high temperature in 1998 caused by a separate weather event, El Ni\u00f1o, she said. \"You could look at what happened in 1998 and say that global warming accelerated and that's not true either. </p> <p>\"Any statistician will tell you that you can't just draw a straight line between two points, you need to look at the underlying trend.\"</p> <p>Despite the recent cooling, average temperatures are still rising at 0.09C per decade, the office says - down from the record 0.33C per decade measured during the 1990s.</p>",
  "<p>Global financial meltdown may have bought Gordon Brown time, but just as important among many Labour MPs and activists in Manchester this week is fear of the return of full-blown Blairism in the shape of a resurgent David Miliband.</p> <p>After a couple of months in which the foreign secretary's bid to position himself as Brown's main challenger seemed to have come unstuck, his weekend media offensive \u2013 with lavish soft focus interviews in the Times and <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2008/09/20/david-miliband-spells-out-his-vision-on-eve-of-labour-conference-115875-20745391/\">Daily Mirror</a> \u2013 sent waves of alarm through the growing ranks of those who want to see Labour respond to the economic crisis by moving away from the discredited market orthodoxies of the Blairite years. Despite Miliband's unpopularity among MPs and the unions, few doubt the likely impact of a full-on media campaign on his behalf in any post-Brown election (hence his discreet wooing of the Murdoch empire).</p> <p>Even more worrying from that point of view was the apparent endorsement of Miliband by the health secretary, Alan Johnson, seen by some on Labour's centre-left and in the unions as potentially the most credible Stop Miliband candidate \u2013 though his own Blairite history casts doubt on how viable a vessel he could be for the hopes of those looking for a change of political direction.</p> <p>In fact, Johnson's Miliband-flattering <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4791378.ece\">interview</a> with the Times stopped short of ruling himself out (\"I don't aspire to that job\") and \u2013 despite claims from leading Blairites that Johnson has signed off a deal to run as Miliband's deputy \u2013 the man himself has now let it be known that his remarks have been misunderstood, and no such decision has been taken.</p> <p>There's no doubt that the mood running through the conference in favour of a crackdown on City speculators, redistribution and tougher intervention in the economy should benefit any leadership contender prepared to move on from the well-worn New Labour formulas of the past.</p> <p>But Miliband has made it abundantly clear in his various appearances on the conference fringe that he will be doing no such thing. His speech last night to the pressure group Progress was classic Blair \u2013 New Labour was a \"coalition, not a faction\", guided by a combination of \"head and heart\" \u2013 and his apparent self-criticism offered little sense of any kind of new political direction. Earlier in the evening, he defended the Iraq war without qualifications, insisting \u2013 like Blair \u2013 that the rights and wrongs of the invasion and occupation would be left to history.</p> <p>Brown and Alistair Darling have been making a few more rhetorical concessions to the dominant mood: the prime minister calling for tighter control on \"irresponsible\" City bonuses and the chancellor today promising the conference to do \"whatever it takes\" to deal with the upheavals in the markets. But both have stopped well short of promising the kind of decisive action both the party and the public are evidently looking for \u2013 and Brown has typically rushed to reassure the City that Labour remains a \"party of business\".</p> <p>That's obviously not going to satisfy the mood inside the conference and beyond. The <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7627608.stm\">call</a> by the Dagenham MP Jon Cruddas for a new 45% tax rate on those earning \u00a3175,000 a year to fund tax cuts for low and middle income earners has attracted widespread support. Meanwhile, delegates this morning voted for a radical union-led agenda \u2013 including price controls and a windfall tax on the energy companies \u2013 to be sent to the party's national policy forum. Of course, that doesn't make it Labour policy, but it's a significant reflection of the new pressure for change.</p> <p>Outside the conference hall, there are other signs of the wider dissatisfaction with the refusal of New Labour over more than a decade to give any representation to the huge swathe of public opinion to its left. Throughout the conference, a <a href=\"http://www.conventionoftheleft.org\">convention of the left</a> \u2013 organised by John Nicholson, former Labour deputy leader of Manchester city council \u2013 is holding a series of meetings and debates on the alternative to Labour's record of \"wars, privatisation and environmental destruction\".</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.poptel.org.uk/scgn/\">Labour Campaign Group</a> MPs, such as John McDonnell, Jeremy Corbyn and Katy Clark, have joined speakers from a dizzying array of groups and parties, from Respect to the left Greens, with the aim of bringing together the notoriously fissiparous left inside and outside the Labour party in common action. Some see it as part of another attempt to form a new leftwing party. But what it certainly reflects is the frustration at the effective denial of a voice to millions in the political mainstream \u2013 and an early taste of some of the fractious fallout that can be expected to follow a Labour defeat at the next election.</p>",
  "<p>Though <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/30/wto.india\">global trade talks collapsed in July</a> for the third time in seven years, an elite group of seven influential countries has sent representatives to Geneva to try once again to revive negotiations. They shouldn't bother. They should leave the so-called Doha development round on life support until they can all remember why they agreed to dedicate the negotiations to improving the prospects of developing countries.</p> <p>Such a respite is not a crisis. It's an opportunity to bring development back into the negotiations. Nor does the breakdown demonstrate the failure of the WTO. Just the opposite. In a system of one country, one vote, developing countries were, for the first time, able to defend their economic interests. </p> <p>The elements of a deal have been in place for a while: modest cuts in agricultural tariffs and subsidies by developed countries in return for modest cuts in manufacturing and services barriers in the developing world. The developed world's refusal to grant poorer nations exceptions to such cuts so they can build competitive national industries and protect their economies from unfair or unequal competition has dragged the talks down. </p> <p>The organising principle for revived global trade negotiations needs to be a recognition that the world economy consists of nations at widely differing levels of development. Developing countries need the policy space to retain, adapt and evolve the kinds of government measures that have been proven to work for development in the west and in other developing countries. </p> <p>Any negotiation that claims to take development seriously must recognise these fundamental asymmetries and address them. One size does not fit all in an unequal world. To paraphrase Nobel economist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/31/society.politics\">Amartya Sen</a>, equal rules with unequal partners constitute unequal rules. The Doha round has floundered over just this issue, as rich-country negotiators demand that India and other developing countries open their markets to more northern goods and services, failing to recognise that at India's stage of development its economy will not develop dynamically if its government cannot protect some markets. </p> <p>To restart negotiations on a pro-development foundation, policy space should be guaranteed in four areas:</p> <p>First, in agriculture, the US and Europe should agree to honour WTO rulings that have deemed their <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE0D81439F93AA25755C0A9629C8B63\">subsidies for cotton and sugar</a> to be in <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3536710.stm\">violation of existing trade rules</a> that forbid exporting products at subsidised prices. This would give a tangible boost to farmers in West Africa and Latin America and send a strong signal to developing countries that developed nations are willing to honour existing WTO rules.</p> <p>What's more, the WTO should take seriously the proposals by many African nations to tame highly concentrated global commodities markets, dominated by agribusinesses that suck most of the value out of these value chains. Rich nations should also grant poorer countries extensive rights to exempt staples of their local economy such as corn, rice and wheat \u2013 so-called \"special products\" \u2013 from tariff cuts, and allow them to raise duties when imports surge \u2013 the \"special safeguard mechanism\" the US would not agree to in July.</p> <p>Second, for manufacturing, the longstanding WTO principle of \"special and differentiated treatment\" should be re-enshrined for poorer nations. Developed nations should roll back patent laws that impede poorer nations from manufacturing cheaper generic drugs and allow selective industrial policy so governments can diversify their economies. What worked for the US, China and South Korea must not be prohibited by the WTO.<br> Third, the WTO needs to wake up to the climate crisis by leaving ample room for the transfer of clean technology to developing countries. Otherwise the diffusion of new technologies and mitigation strategies will get bogged down in global rules over intellectual property, investment and goods trade.</p> <p>Finally, there should be a moratorium on north-south preferential trade agreements. These deals exploit the asymmetric nature of bargaining power between developed and developing nations, divert trade away from nations with true comparative advantages and curtail the ability of developing countries to deploy effective policies for development.</p> <p>Such organising principles for reviving world trade talks would not solely be an act of charity. On the contrary, policy space, when seized by the countries that bargain for it, brings growth to developing countries, and such growth brings rising demand for northern products. </p> <p>For now, though, keep the Doha round on life support. Its condition is critical but stable. And let's hope that elections in the US, Europe and elsewhere bring a new commitment to equitable development.</p>",
  "<p>The renationalisation of the electricity and gas industry was put back on the Labour agenda for first time by an ex-minister and a union chief today in the wake of rises of up 35% on fuel bills and soaring profits by utilities companies.</p> <p>Michael Meacher, the former environment minister, and Tony Woodley, the joint general secretary of the UK's largest union, Unite, received the biggest cheers from the conference floor when they demanded a return to public ownership.</p> <p>Meacher asked: \"Is this government on the side of big business or is it on the side of the fuel poor? If privatisation of energy is going to lead to this massive exploitation and stuff the consumer, then, yes, we should be thinking again about having a public sector role in our energy sector.\"</p> <p>Woodley said: \"If they [the power companies] still don't get the message, this government should consider taking these essential industries - gas, electricity, water - back under public ownership.\"</p> <p>Referring to the nationalisation of Northern Rock, he added: \"If it's good enough for the banks, it's good enough for our utilities.\"</p> <p>While delegates gave a standing ovation to Alistair Darling, the chancellor, much of the direction of the party's policy agenda was set immediately afterwards as the conference voted to approve motions put forward in a deal by the three biggest unions, Unite, Unison and the GMB.</p> <p>The motions mean the party's policy forum will have to examine a windfall tax on power companies, a price cap and new price controls by a tougher regulator for the industry, action on excessive bonuses for business directors and a big leap in equal pay for women in the public sector. The issues will return to the conference next year \u2013 the last one before the general election.</p> <p>By splitting the key issues between them, the unions were able to get enough support from constituency parties to back their motions and get them accepted by conference.</p> <p>The GMB also succeeded in getting through a motion committing the party to ending Britain's opt-out of the working time directive, ending the long-hours culture in Britain and making it illegal to work over 40 hours a week. </p> <p>However Labour officials said this did not count because it was overruled by another motion which accepts that only abuses under the working time directive will be remedied by the government.</p> <p>Ministers also insisted that this would not alter the government's backing for the CBI position of not curbing working hours.<br> However, the union victory was aimed not at ministers but at Labour and Socialist MEPs in Strasbourg, who will have to vote on Britain's opt-out in December. They are hoping the European parliament will vote to block the opt-out.</p> <p>The union rhetoric on all these issues was strong. Derek Simpson, Unite's other joint general secretary, said with regard to City bonuses: \"Alistair, these people want ordinary people to share their pain but they won't share their gain.</p> <p>\"If you can't regulate the bonus culture, then tax it out of existence.\"</p> <p>Simpson said that the practice had created \"an all-powerful, mega-rich elite, with no connection to ordinary people - an amoral class without a care for how their reckless behaviour is wrecking lives.\"</p> <p>Paul Kenny, the general secretary of the GMB, said: \"Gordon [Brown], tackling speculators who damage our country for greed is popular. Standing up for our citizens against an unregulated dash for cash by energy companies is a vote winner.\"</p> <p>Dave Prentis, the general secretary of Unison, said: \"The right thing to do is to levy a windfall tax now on those energy companies that have made those huge profits to lift people out of debt.\"</p>",
  "<p>Like a weird cinematic version of the Roll Chronicle of British kings, it sometimes seems that the GPO Film Unit stands at the head of the family tree of British film and television. Established in 1933, its ethos and influence can be discerned everywhere, from Coronation Street to reality soaps via Ealing Studios and The Green Cross Code Man. Melvyn Bragg even described the GPO Unit as \"the font from which our tradition of arts programmes spring\". To celebrate the release of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/sep/19/documentary?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=film\">Love Letters and Live Wires</a>, a theatrical tour of GPO curios and classics, here is our own alphabetical introduction to an enduring, and highly unlikely, cultural legacy. </p> <p><strong>A is for Aboriginal</strong> Painted directly on to celluloid, the startling GPO shorts of New Zealander Len Lye were inspired by Aboriginal and Maori art. In the lower case sense of the word, the GPO Film Unit might be the aboriginal form of modern British cinema.</p> <p><strong>Blackheath</strong> In 1933 the unit moved to new sound-equipped studios at Bennett Park Road. As well as frequently appearing in their film's \"street\" scenes, Blackheath provided one of the pillars of the unit's future success. The second was ...</p> <p><strong>Alberto \"Cav\" Cavalcanti</strong> The Brazilian made a huge impact on the GPO's films on account of his experience in the commercial industry (ie he actually knew what he was doing) and because of his avant-garde know-how, as evidenced in <a href=\"http://www.filmreference.com/Films-Ra-Ro/Rien-Que-les-Heures.html\">Rien que les heures</a>.</p> <p><strong>Documentary</strong> If the wider world of British cinema is mentioned at all in a standard film history tome, it's invariably mentioned in conjunction with documentary, several conceptions of which were \"invented\" by the unit. </p> <p><strong>Empire Marketing Board</strong> The unit was created in embryo at the Empire Marketing Board, unusual origins that ensured it was more attuned to the work of a Commonwealth-wide network of interesting modernists than the petty politics of Whitehall.</p> <p><strong>Denis Foreman</strong> According to the future luminary of Granada TV, the unit much impressed the Italian neorealists.</p> <p><strong>John Grierson</strong> The godfather of the GPO Cosa Nostra. As a critic he coined the term \"documentary\", as head of the unit Grierson made it his business to keep the family in check.</p> <p><strong>H is for Harry</strong> When not expounding theories about the proper role of film in a democratic society, Grierson tended to appoint a) Scotsmen and b) people who had worked at sea. Harry Watt ticked both of these boxes and, in his strong-willed collectivism and spirited individualism, seemed typically GPO. His <a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/1330491/\">Saving of Bill Blewitt</a> was the first \"story documentary\" ever made. </p> <p><strong>The Imperial Six</strong> The GPO's first package of commercially released shorts - Weather Forecast, Granton Trawler, <a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/1341944/index.html\">Cable Ship</a>, <a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/1290738/index.html\">6.30 Collection</a>, Spring on the Farm and Windmill in Barbados.</p> <p><strong>Humphrey Jennings</strong> Writer, painter, designer and in Lindsay Anderson's endlessly quoted estimation \"the only true poet of the English cinema\". </p> <p><strong>Kazoo band</strong> Controversially featured in Spare Time, Jennings' affectionate, subtle and sly <a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/443890/\">portrait of Britain at play</a>. </p> <p><strong>Love on the Wing</strong> Freewheeling jazz-influenced animation genius from...</p> <p><strong>Norman McLaren</strong> The Scottish animator was just one of the unlikely band of avant gardists that blossomed under Grierson's patronage.</p> <p><strong>Night Mail</strong> The GPO's cinematic testament par excellence. As redolent of the 1930s as a Poirot novel, the Shell guides and Frank Pick's transformation of the Underground, <a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/530415/index.html\">Night Mail</a> is stuffed with bad jokes, cracking poetry and progressive patriotism. The story of a night on the travelling post office (TPO) exemplifies what historian Ross McKibbin has described as one of the key characteristics of the era, \"the redistribution of cultural esteem.\" </p> <p><strong>Organisational efficiency</strong> London Midland Scottish celebrated Night Mail's success by repainting the interiors of the TPO green \"to avoid eyestrain\" and introducing electric tea urns.</p> <p><strong>Philatelists</strong> It is often argued that the unit's distance from commercial cinema chains limited their influence, but who needs popcorn-munchers when you've got philatelists? For many years <a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/1300758/index.html\">William Coldstream's The King's Stamp</a>, which details Barnett Freedman's sketching of the jubilee stamp, was the most watched film ever made. </p> <p><strong>Q is for Quentin</strong> Reynolds, that is. While the US remained neutral during the second world war, American reporters such as Quentin Reynolds and Ed Murrow were invited to provide voiceovers to the unit's footage of the blitz. Their eloquent delivery was engineered to elicit the sympathy of sceptical North American audiences.</p> <p><strong>Lotte Reiniger</strong> The German puppeteer and silhouette animator was one of the many talented emigres who found refuge from the Nazi regime at the unit. </p> <p><strong>Slavery</strong> What the abolition of slavery \u00a32 coin was to 2008, the unit's God's Chillun was to the 1938 anti-slavery campaign. </p> <p><strong>Sir Stephen Tallents</strong> In addition to establishing the unit, the aptly-named Tallents sketched the contested border between Estonia and Latvia, played football for Grenoble in their historic win over Lyon, introduced listener research at the BBC, and founded public relations in Britain. In his spare time he went walking with his friend William Beveridge, wrote short-story collections, ran a rat-skin leather business and expounded the health benefits of squirrel pie.</p> <p><strong>Unesco</strong> After the war the GPO's creatives and technicians scattered far and wide, their influence spread into commercial film-making and independent television and resulted in the establishment of the <a href=\"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/films/1964to1979/filmpage_strangers.htm\">\"Charley says\"</a> Central Office of Information. The formidable Grierson was even appointed controller of film at Unesco.</p> <p><strong>Valentine's Day</strong> The introduction of Rex Whistler's Valentine's Day telegram, Giles Gilbert Scott's <a href=\"http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/the-phone-box/biography/the-red-phone-box-biography-finished\">Jubilee Kiosk</a>, Telephone Chess tournaments and the phenomenally successful Speaking Clock \u2013 the film unit was just one aspect of the wider GPO renaissance of the 1930s.</p> <p><strong>W is for Wystan Hugh Auden</strong> It is more than coincidence that in his year at the GPO, Auden aired two of the century's best known poems in English \u2013 Night Mail and Funeral Blues (later popularised by Four Weddings and a Funeral.) </p> <p><strong>X</strong> In a newly-enfranchised Britain a scrawled \"X\" was no longer enough. Tallents saw the GPO's films as providing a \"sextant and compass\" that could help map out a more democratic future.</p> <p><strong>\"Young men in high-necked sweaters\"</strong> JB Priestley's impression of the unit after taking a starring role in They Live in Two Worlds, a film which presciently argued that modern communication technology would eventually bring a new transnational global community into being. </p> <p><strong>Zeal</strong> The son of a preacher, it is unsurprising that Grierson's rhetoric has a whiff of Calvinism about it. \"Studio films largely ignore the possibility of opening up the screen on the real world,\" he argued, \"documentary can achieve an intimacy of knowledge and effect impossible in the shim sham mechanics of the studio and the lily-fingered interpretations of the metropolitan actor.\" How right he still is.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/morganstanley\">Morgan Stanley</a> is in talks to sell up to 20% of the bank to Mitsubishi UFJ Financial group, in an effort to shore up its balance sheet and secure its future in the wake of one of the most tumultuous periods in the history of Wall Street.</p> <p>The US bank came under severe pressure last week following the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the decision of Merrill Lynch to seek shelter in the arms of Bank of America in a $50bn (\u00a327.1bn) deal.</p> <p>In a joint statement, Morgan Stanley and Japan's Mitsubishi said they had signed a letter of intent and plan to pursue \"a global strategic alliance\". The deal, for 10-20% of Morgan Stanley would be done \"as soon as practicable\" following due diligence by Mitsubishi, the world's second largest bank with $1.1 trillion in bank deposits.</p> <p>Morgan Stanley had held discussions with the American commercial bank Wachovia and China Investment Corp about some form of deal.</p> <p>The agreement follows swift on the heels of the announcement that Morgan Stanley and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/goldmansachs\">Goldman Sachs</a>, the last two investment banks left standing, will become traditional bank holding companies, marking the end of an era for Wall Street.</p> <p>The Federal Reserve's surprise announcement, which came at 2.30am London time, places the banks under the supervision the bank regulators and gives them easier access to credit to help them ride out the financial crisis.</p> <p>The move spells the end of Wall Street as it has existed until now - a group of lightly regulated investment banks. The changes will also enable Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs to go on an acquisition spree and rival larger firms like Citigroup, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase.</p> <p>Last week, Wall Street underwent some of the most dramatic changes in its history. The US government refused to bail out Lehman Brothers but came to the rescue of insurer American International Group and mortgage-finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</p> <p>In Britain, HBOS was taken over by Lloyds TSB last week.</p> <p>The Fed's latest move came as US Congress considered a $700bn rescue package for the troubled financial sector announced by US Treasury secretary Henry Paulson. \"I'm also going to be pressing our colleagues around the world to design similar programmes for their banks and institutions when they are appropriate,\" Paulson said yesterday.</p> <p>The G7 group of finance ministers and central bank governors today welcomed the US bailout plan but there was no sign that other governments would follow Washington by drawing up similar rescue packages. The G7 vowed to take \"whatever actions may be necessary\" to ensure the stability of the global financial system.</p> <p>In a statement released overnight, the Fed said its board had approved the applications of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to become bank holding companies and authorised credit to the two firms \"against all types of collateral\" that commercial banks can use to get loans from the central bank.</p> <p>Goldman Sachs said it will become the fourth largest US bank holding company. \"We view regulation by the Federal Reserve Board as appropriate and in the best interests of protecting and growing our franchise across our diverse range of businesses,\" it said.</p> <p>Goldman Sachs already has two deposit-taking subsidiaries with some $20bn in deposits.</p> <p>Morgan Stanley, which has some $36bn in bank deposits, said it sought the new status from the Fed \"to provide the firm [with] maximum flexibility and stability to pursue new business opportunities as the financial marketplace undergoes rapid and profound changes\".</p>",
  "<p>There is a big myth in politics, and it is this: that New Labour really was new. That it was a truly centre-ground party that had radically abandoned the leftist ideologies of yesteryear that had led the country into the mire of the late 70s. Fitting then that the party's theme song <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dl-ai9HuR60\">Things Can Only Get Better</a> should have been by a group called D:Ream. Because now we've woken up from the dream of Blair to find ourselves in a country that at heart is testament to deeply leftist politics. </p> <p>The tax burden is actually higher now than in 1978 (at 36% of GDP, compared with 33% three decades ago). We now boast a civil service of half a million - about the size of Sheffield. That includes a cut in the size of our armed forces from 238,550 in 1978 to 73,290 today. Yet it does not include all the jobs that have been pushed off the public-sector books by being recategorised under a plethora of agencies and trusts. And we are facing huge national debt - a financial position that is closer to the 1970s than we'd like to think.</p> <p>True, there were some genuinely centre-ground ideologues: Stephen Byers and the Blairites (surely a better name for a rock band than D:Ream?), Charles Clarke and Alan Milburn. But many of those genuinely good centre-ground ideas (such as academies, for example, resurrecting the idea of Conservatives' city technology colleges) were being implemented off the back of old-left mechanisms. They are more bureaucratic and expensive than they need be. Funded by ever-increasing taxes, administered by a burgeoning civil service. </p> <p>So Blair was able to send centre-ground fireworks up into the sky to woo middle England. Meanwhile, back in the murk on terra firma, the old control-based machine of the left chugged on behind the scenes, with Gordon Brown at the wheel.</p> <p>And if the old saying \"By their fruits you shall know them\" is true, our taxation levels, civil service size, level of national debt and inability to deal with the global economic downturn shows that after all the fireworks and good centre ground ideas, there was not so much that was \"new\" about Labour. <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7622324.stm\">Milburn now wants change</a>, for the simple reason that a change in Labour never really took place in the first place. </p> <p>It's a real shame. An opportunity missed. New Labour could have delivered the dream and truly changed Britain for the good - if only its control-freak instinct could have been resisted. Even now, Labour politicians talk of \"empowering people\". But the very fact that it is Whitehall granting people these so called \"powers\" over their own lives, which were theirs to begin with, reinforces Whitehall's dominance. </p> <p>Giving a school \"power to innovate\" is simply giving it permission to apply to central government to avoid a barrage of unnecessary Whitehall restrictions, for a limited period. That's not empowerment - it's centralisation in disguise. </p> <p>As the credit crunch begins to bite in the high street and bastions of the financial world fall like dominos, the grim reality now dawns that, once again, the country's been spent out by a leftist government. Once again, it will take hard-headed, sensible, centre-right politics to sort it out. </p> <p>Will Gordon Brown retreat further back to his deep-left core at his party conference speech tomorrow, and reach for the \"capitalism is bad\" vote? If he does, he will be disowning any success he may have presided over in the City. But even if he does not, the nation just does not have the time or money for any more pseudo centre-right. The D:Ream is over. Things are getting tough, and it's time for the real thing.</p> <p>Talking of academies, I attended the opening ceremony of the new Brightstowe Academy, in Shirehampton, Bristol, this week. The previous school (Portway) had struggled for years, but the <a href=\"www.oasistrust.org\">Oasis Trust</a> came in and gave it a new birth. </p> <p>I was struck not only by the energy and vision of Oasis, and the head, Julie Winterman, but also by their sensitivity to what young people need and want. Perhaps the most striking part of the day was seeing how many of the things that really made a difference didn't cost anything. One girl told me how, when Oasis took over, they were all put into houses, in their school, and had inter-house competitions. </p> <p>I saw the benefits in action: the opening event was finishing and hundreds of young people were getting ready to storm out of the marquee. Chaos looked certain to ensue. </p> <p>The head took the microphone. \"I know which house is the winner of the behaviour competition,\" she said. (Or something similar.) \"But if you don't all behave and leave in an orderly fashion, that might change.\" Hush fell. And several hundred teenagers filed out in order. </p> <p>Good buildings and excellent facilities are important - but won't make a school. A good head, organisation and vision cost nothing, but are priceless. Here's to future success at Brightstowe.</p>",
  "<p>Nomura today secured a deal to acquire the Asian operations of Lehman Brothers, a week after the US investment bank's collapse sparked panic in global financial markets.<br> Japan's biggest brokerage house saw off rival bids from Barclays and Standard Chartered following talks over the weekend. It is now thought that Nomura is also the front-runner in talks for Lehman's London businesses. Barclays is known to be interested in the equities part of the London operations, while Nomura was prepared to bid for a wide-range of businesses. </p> <p>The Asia deal, thought to be worth around $230m (\u00a3125m), includes all of Lehman's franchises in the region and around 3,000 employees, all of whom will be offered new contracts. </p> <p>\"This is a transformational deal that allows us to bring together the strengths of Nomura and Lehman Brothers to further deliver value to our clients,\" said Kenichi Watanabe, Nomura's president and CEO. \"It will significantly extend our reach in Asia. We see immediate strategic benefits, delivering the scale and scope to realize our vision to be a world-class investment bank.\" </p> <p>Jesse Bhattal, CEO of Lehman Brothers Asia, said the deal represented \"a remarkable opportunity\" for both firms. \"We are honored to work with Nomura in building a platform which we believe offers tremendous potential.\" </p> <p>In London, Lehman employees were waiting to hear news of a potential bid which could save up to 3,000 jobs. Dan Schwarzmann, joint administrator and partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said: \"We have now focused on one party as they are interested in acquiring a wider team, which should result in a better deal for staff and creditors of these businesses. Given the complexity of Lehman brothers, these negotiations are difficult, but I'm hoping to give certainty to all involved as soon as possible.\" </p> <p>In the Asia Pacific region, Lehman's net revenue for the first half of the year stood at $1.4bn, or about 20% of the bank's overall revenues. </p> <p>Data from the financial services agency shows that Lehman's Japanese unit manages about \u00a51.2tn (\u00a36.1bn) worth of assets from investors. It was last week ordered to suspend most of its operations until September 26 after the US bank collapsed under the weight of $60bn in real-estate debt. </p> <p>Lehman Brothers Japan, which opened in 1973, applied for court protection with debts totaling \u00a53.43tn, making it the second-biggest bankruptcy in Japan since the second world war. </p> <p>Nomura and Barclays have been locked in competition to take control of Lehman's operations in Asia and Europe. Nomura executives are thought to have clinched the deal following talks in Hong Kong over the weekend. </p> <p>Last week, the British bank agreed to pay $1.75bn for Lehman's north American investment banking and capital markets businesses, but was outbid in Asia. Shares in Nomura rose 8% in Tokyo today on news of the possible buyout.</p>",

Darling will also raise his forecasts for public borrowing and outline medium-term plans for bringing the public finances back under control.</p> <p>In his keynote speech to the Labour party conference, Darling said that he was allowing borrowing to rise during the downturn in order to \"support the economy and families when they need it most\".</p> <p>But with some analysts predicting that the budget deficit could hit \u00a390bn as Britain suffers its first recession since the early 1990s, the chancellor warned that there were tough decisions on tax and spending ahead.</p> <p>\"Make no mistake, discipline in public finances is essential; being clear about our priorities.</p> <p>\"In the medium term, governments everywhere have to live within their means \u2013 so I will set out this autumn how I will continue to deliver sound public finances.\"</p> <p>Darling is also expected to use his PBR address to acknowledge that the financial turmoil has made it necessary for the government to breach its fiscal rules \u2013 to borrow only for investment over the economic cycle and to keep public debt below 40% of GDP. </p> <p>Darling will use his Mais lecture in the City next month to explain how fiscal policy should respond to financial crises.</p> <p>Referring to his comment in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/aug/30/alistairdarling.economy\">a recent Guardian interview</a> that the global economy was facing its most challenging time in 60 years, Darling said: \"I've made headlines by saying just how tough times are. I draw little comfort from the fact that many people now understand what I meant.</p> <p>\"Yes we are facing real problems. Our economy, along with every other developed country, is bound to slow. It's my job to be realistic. And these problems will take time to work their way through. But I also said \u2013 and this made a lot fewer headlines \u2013 that I was confident that Britain will come through these difficult times.\"</p> <p>The chancellor said the global financial system would \"never be the same\" after the turmoil caused by the year-long crisis. \"These are extraordinary, turbulent times. A crisis which has rocked the financial institutions around the world on top of huge rises in oil, food and commodity prices.\"</p> <p>Darling said the government had been right to respond to the crisis by taking Northern Rock into public ownership and by introducing legislation to make it easier to intervene if other banks ran into problems. The Bank of England had been authorised to inject more than \u00a3100bn to help stabilise the UK banking system.</p> <p>These measures were essential, the chancellor added, but would take time to work. \"We are on a difficult road and there will, I am afraid, be bumps along the way. But I will continue to do whatever it takes to maintain financial stability and I remain confident we will do so.\"</p> <p>The chancellor plans to introduce a new banking bill to the Commons within a fortnight, designed to strengthen supervision and give new powers to financial regulators. The new chairman of the Financial Services Authority, Lord Turner, to \"review urgently what we need to do to improve the system.</p> <p>\"It is not a question to light-touch regulation against heavy-handed regulation. It's about effective regulation. I can promise that wherever weaknesses are found in the financial system, whether in the powers of the government, the Bank of England or the FSA, I will take steps to deal with it.\"</p> <p>Darling added: \"We need to look as well at the culture of huge bonuses which have distorted the way decisions are made. Bonuses should encourage good long-term decisions, not short-term reckless ones.\" </p> <p>The chancellor believes the FSA should use its existing powers to clamp down on companies where high bonuses have created incentives for traders to take excessive risks.</p>",
  "<p>It was a violent dose of nature to a coast already hammered by decades of pollution, population growth and habitat loss. As scientists and land managers start to assess the storm's impacts on beaches, dunes and marshes, they are seeing signs of present damage and future worries.</p> <p>\"The impacts are going to be phenomenal,\" said Jim Sutherlin, superintendent of the Texas parks and wildlife department's 24,250-acre J.D. Murphree Wildlife Management Area, near Port Arthur. \"We're going to take the critters that crawl or walk, and for the full stretch of the coastal zone that got the full impact of the coastal flood, they're just eliminated.\"</p> <p>Although big storms are a natural part of any coastline's life story, the upper Gulf Coast of Texas was already under stress from many sources.</p> <p>Coastal development and subsidence - a drop in the land's surface level as petroleum and groundwater are pumped out - have degraded large areas of marsh. Excessive organic material in coastal waters creates a \"dead zone\" of almost no oxygen in the upper Texas gulf.</p> <p>And today's idea of a normal Texas coast could change dramatically in a future with higher sea levels from global warming. Earlier this month, scientists from three American universities concluded in the journal Science that a global sea level rise of 31.5 inches by the year 2100 should be the assumption. The highest conceivable rise, they estimate, is 6.5 feet.</p> <p>Even the lower figure would put much of the existing Texas coastline permanently under water and would let a hurricane's strongest force reach farther inland. With coastal development, storms and rising seas all chewing away natural defences such as dunes and wetlands, damage from future hurricanes is likely to get worse.</p> <p>\"I'm sure what we'll see (from Ike) is more evidence of what happens when we don't maintain those natural barriers,\" said Larry McKinney, executive director of the Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico studies at Texas A&amp;M University-Corpus Christi.<br>\"A hurricane is kind of a small-scale climate-change model,\" McKinney said. \"We really need to start pulling together a long-term plan for responding to climate change.\"</p> <p>The Texas coast is crucial to an astonishing range of life, from fish and amphibians to the birds that stop over during migrations along the great Central Flyway from South American winter habitats to arctic nesting grounds. What happens to the dunes, estuaries and marshes along the upper Gulf Coast can be felt across the entire hemisphere for years.</p> <p>Under natural conditions, coastal ecosystems adapt to the effects of hurricanes and even use them to flush out marshes and estuaries, changing water chemistry and plant communities.</p> <p>Storms can restart the cycles of succession, or the natural rhythm of birth, maturity, death and rebirth in an ecosystem.</p> <p>Coastal habitats also absorb storms' energy, a lesson made real in 2005 when Hurricane Katrina rushed ashore unimpeded by the former marsh that once protected New Orleans. The long, narrow strips of sand that parallel the Texas coast and the marshes behind them attempt the same role; they aren't called barrier islands for nothing.</p> <p>Ike's storm surge threatened to take out in a few hours the dune build-up of years, and to drown under seawater the marshes that survive on a mixture of fresh water and saltwater. The death of more marshes and the loss of the natural protection they provide is a certainty, experts said.</p> <p>\"These marshes were not in a healthy, dynamic state to start with because of human impacts,\" said Sutherlin, the wildlife area superintendent. Hundreds of acres, perhaps thousands, will be lost, he added.</p> <p>\"Everything's still under water,\" Sutherlin said. \"It looks like an ocean out there.\"</p> <p>The hurricane's effect on the complex natural system of the Texas coast will be apparent when scientists measure water quality in the gulf. The northernmost reaches of the Texas shoreline frequently becomes a \"dead zone\" with extremely low oxygen levels, but a hurricane quickly restores the oxygen, said Steve DiMarco of Texas A&amp;M's department of oceanography.</p> <p>Unlike the more widely publicised dead zone at the mouth of the Mississippi river, which is attributed to excessive nitrates from farming and other upriver sources, the Texas dead zone is linked to organic material of uncertain origin stirred up from coastal marshes. Sea level rise will complicate the problem.</p> <p>\"Over the long run, as the seawater flushes in, more organic material will get out,\" DiMarco said. But as to whether that will mean a bigger dead zone, \"I won't go that far.\"</p> <p>Steps for reducing hurricane threats range from restoring marshes to keeping people away from vulnerable areas. However, with each successive storm, each census showing coastal population increasing, and each new, higher projection of sea-level rise, Texas coastal experts fear that they have fewer choices.</p> <p>\"We have some options, but they're running out,\" said McKinney of the Harte Institute. \"We need to take advantage of this disaster to learn.\"</p>",
  "<p>Has the famously savvy first minister of Scotland finally slipped up? The sudden and dramatic sale of HBOS last week has put Alex Salmond's political and economic reputation under unwelcome scrutiny. </p> <p>First, his much-quoted claim that \"spivs and speculators\" were solely to blame for the bank's collapse in value has been dismissed comprehensively by bankers, including his own allies, and business leaders.</p> <p>His claim that an independent Scottish government would have found \u00a3100bn to bail HBOS out has been ridiculed, not least because HBOS's bosses were willing partners in the Lloyds TSB rescue.</p> <p>Labour has also gleefully seized on the revelation that Salmond's chief economic advisor and mentor Sir George Mathewson, former head of Salmond's old employer RBS, is one of those \"spivs\", since he now runs Toscafund Asset Management. </p> <p>That outfit was not involved in the HBOS affair - doubtless there are other Scottish financiers and institutions that were - but Mathewson told the Sunday Herald that short selling was \"perfectly valid\". </p> <p>The sale of Scotland's oldest bank - an institution integral to the country's identity - is the most significant political and financial crisis to erupt since the SNP won power last year. </p> <p>But what is most telling is that it took Salmond and his often brilliant political team much of last week to offer concrete proposals \u2013 it was in a Friday briefing to Sunday newspaper journalists that this \u00a3100bn bail-out plan came to light.</p> <p>When Salmond was pressed on what he would have done by Iain Gray, the new Labour leader, at first ministers' questions on Thursday - at the storm's height - the SNP leader had no answer. </p> <p>Gray let that slide - either too nervous at his maiden outing at FMQs (Salmond is formidable on his feet) or believing it would be uncool to upset the collegiate air of grief and loss that gripped the chamber.</p> <p>This, it seems, is a time when Scotland on its own would have been largely impotent. Salmond has spoken of laws to control short-selling spivs and speculators, but since Scotland has no international stock exchange, that would be Westminster's job. </p> <p>It is a fundamental question for the SNP: the country's booming financial sector (with its \u00a3600bn of assets under management) is at the core of Scotland's economy. </p> <p>While Scotland's growth has lagged behind the UK average, its employment rates are healthier; so too are house prices. Given the dragging effect of the immense deprivation in parts of west Scotland, this is impressive.</p> <p>But HBOS and RBS are global businesses, operating at a level that dwarfs Scotland and the Scottish executive. And so too do HBOS's debts - it has been reported that it would have needed to refinance \u00a3198bn within a few months to stay solvent. </p> <p>The SNP's mooted North Sea oil fund would've evaporated overnight to quench that.</p> <p>Remember too that SNP policy is for an independent Scotland to stay with sterling, thus giving the foreign Bank of England influence over the economy, thus increasing its economic vulnerability. </p> <p>There have been other moments since the SNP's arrival in government when Scotland's interdependency and diminutive stature have been highlighted.</p> <p>In the days after the Glasgow airport attack last year, Salmond and his justice secretary, Kenny McAskill, were forced to cede control to the Metropolitan police. The surviving suspect was handed over to the English (although it is arguable that an independent Scotland would not have been attacked in the first place).</p> <p>Another telling moment was Gordon Brown's only appearance in the chamber at Holyrood, standing alongside Microsoft's billionaire founder, Bill Gates, in February 2007 to give a speech on education, technology and globalisation. </p> <p>This was Brown in his element - the global player, polishing his legacy. <br>Nicola Sturgeon, Salmond's gifted deputy and a future SNP leader, watched from the front row, an onlooker. Surely even the most optimistic nationalist would doubt Gates would share a stage with Salmond or Sturgeon.</p> <p>What this affair has done is to give Salmond's opponents, particularly the Scottish Labour party, the first evidence that the first minister is fallible after all. </p> <p>But his critics may overestimate this affair's damage to Salmond's reputation, not least since Salmond is in this for the long game. His short-term goal is re-election in 2011. He wants consolidation of the SNP's grip on power. Independence can wait. </p> <p>His \"spivs and speculators\" rhetoric is likely to play well among the voters of Glenrothes in central Fife, many of whom are commuters working for Scotland's great banks. </p> <p>In Glenrothes, Methil and Buckhaven, many voters will likely be cheering on a feisty Scottish leader again fighting for Scotland's interests, particularly if he snatches the credit for saving HBOS jobs in Scotland after his frenetic series of meetings with Lloyds TSB, his financial services advisory committee, and the unions this week. </p> <p>It seems Brown is poised to begin personally campaigning in Glenrothes so he will have the chance to contest that. </p> <p>But the increasingly heavy assaults on Brown from inside the Labour party, evidence that his putative byelection coordinator Frank Roy has been sacked, and the rash of weekend opinion polls suggesting anything from a narrow SNP lead to total Labour wipe-out in Glenrothes, will influence this byelection far more than a debate about stock market regulation. </p> <p>Alex Salmond will survive this, and on current form is the only leader of the two who will see the 2011 Holyrood election - or perhaps even the next for Westminster.</p>",
  "<p>At a Fabian Society fringe last night Ed Balls was pretty critical of those who believe in light-touch regulation. He criticised the Tories for opposing the creation of the Financial Services Authority in 1997 and he said that the current economic crisis had exposed the folly of the light-touch merchants. Balls said: </p> <blockquote> <p>Those people who think that the global market can be run without regulation, or with self-regulation, or with light-touch regulation have been entirely routed, have been entirely disproved.</p> </blockquote> <p>But, as the Fabian general secretary Sunder Katwala points out <a href=\"http://nextleft2.blogspot.com/2008/09/ed-balls-era-of-light-touch-regulation.html\">on his blog</a>, this appears to contradict the message of a speech John Hutton gave earlier this year in which he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/may/29/regulators.economy\">attacked the over-regulation of business</a>.</p> <p>More embarrassingly, as James Naughtie said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning, Balls's comments also appear to contradict what Gordon Brown was saying in 2005 when he was championing light-touch regulation. Announcing a <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/newsroom_and_speeches/press/2005/press_50_05.cfm\">Better Regulation Action Plan</a> as chancellor, Brown said:</p> <blockquote> <p>The new model we propose is quite different. In a risk-based approach there is no inspection without justification, no form-filling without justification, and no information requirements without justification. Not just a light touch but a limited touch. Instead of routine regulation attempting to cover all, we adopt a risk-based approach which targets only the necessary few.</p> </blockquote> <p>So, was Balls contradicting his former boss at the Treasury? Hutton's speech was really about corporate, not financial, regulation, and I suppose you could argue that Brown's 2005 comments did not exclusively refer to regulation of the City. But they still fit uneasily with what Balls told the Fabian fringe meeting.</p> <p>Alistair Darling tried to square the circle in his conference speech this morning. He said:</p> <blockquote> <p>It's not a question of light-touch regulation against heavy-handed regulation. It's about effective regulation.</p> </blockquote> <p>That clears it up a bit. But it doesn't really obscure the fact that the message is changing. Light-touch regulation used to be perceived as a positive. Now it isn't.</p>",
  "<p>Wherever you go <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree+politics/labourconference\">in Manchester</a>, eavesdropping on arguments, it's clear that Labour is deeply split on the economy. This is not a bad thing. \"Split\" means argument and without argument, ideas don't advance. But it is a debate that needs to be cleared up.</p> <p>For the left, the economic crisis is straightforward \u2013 a crisis of capitalism that makes the case for traditional socialist answers. They include higher taxes on the rich, a ban on City bonuses, possibly nationalisation of struggling banks. For the Blairites, it's a bump that has to be got over but which doesn't really challenge the market economy or the government's philosophy. It's still fine to be \"filthy rich\" as long as you are competent too.</p> <p>People here are shouting at each other over this. To go full-heartedly either way would be the end for Labour, though. If you retreat to a simple, rich-good, markets-good Blairism, there is no point in having a party called Labour. If you retreat to class war, you are doing just what Cameron is praying for, and finally ceding the middle ground to the Tories. They'd be back in power for a generation.</p> <p>Interestingly, the best response so far is coming from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/22/alistairdarling.taxandspending\">Alistair Darling</a>. The latter gave the clearest explanation I've heard about our economic problems, in his best conference speech ever (not the delivery, of course, he'll never be an eloquent orator, but the content was excellent). He resisted the temptation to gloat, after his his much criticised assertion that times are the toughest for years was proved right.</p> <p>And he quietly made the case for government intervention to stop problems being repeated \u2013 \"it is clearer than ever that markets can't do this on their own.\"</p> <p>Brown, meanwhile, is convinced the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/22/gordonbrown.economy\">global banking system is bust</a> and needs radical fixing. In a typical Brown way, he's saying nothing much about the detail yet. He's thinking fiercely in private. Even if the two of them can't strong-arm the US into a new world banking settlement overnight, they can change the climate. The answer isn't old leftism, but it does involve a new wave of banking regulation, and at last an end to the old fawning on the swaggering, greedy City culture.</p> <p>Bonuses can't be banned outright, but the Financial Services Authority will be looking at making the bonus system more transparent, and preventing deals being done which distort the market. That much, government can and should do.</p> <p>People at the bottom struggling with fuel poverty and food inflation need more help, fast. Never forget that the Tories were against the regulators in the first place and are still struggling with a coherent response to what has been a failure of spivs, rather than a failure of ministers. Yes, this is a crisis of capitalism, but it needs new answers. Get that message out, and Labour might yet have some hope.</p>",
  "<p>The G7 group of finance ministers and central bank governors today welcomed the $700bn (\u00a3bn) US bailout plan for the financial industry but there was no sign that other governments would follow Washington by drawing up similar rescue packages.</p> <p>The G7 vowed to take \"whatever actions may be necessary\" to ensure the stability of the global financial system. The group said that it strongly supported the US Treasury plan to purchase up to $700bn in toxic mortgage debt and other securities.

  "<p>\"It hurts\" said Iain Gray, Labour's new Scottish group leader \u2013 also known as as \"the worst job in the world\". He meant being in opposition, but he's not wrong about the pain. Gray now has the dubious privilege of facing Alex \"The Destroyer\" Salmond every week at first minister's questions in the Scottish Parliament. The SNP leader has already seen off two Labour leaders \u2013 Jack McConnell and Wendy Alexander \u2013 in the last year alone. How long will Gray last?</p> <p>Well no one would call him a great orator, and at 9.30am before a half-empty conference in Manchester, he didn't discover any platform magic. It was a workmanlike speech in which he laid to rest the constitutional radicalism of Wendy Alexander and announced that Labour in Scotland is going to return to traditional unionist themes. No talk of referendums on independence or new tax powers for Holyrood, or even the Calman Commission set up by his predecessor to promote further devolution. Instead Gray delivered an attack on the SNP as neo-Thatcherites and gave a warning to Scots that, in the present global economic turmoil, they need the security of the United Kingdom behind them more than ever.</p> <p>Labour believe that, once again, fear is the best way to destroy the appeal of nationalism. \"No one believes that HBOS could have been saved by independence\" declared Gray, claiming that if it hadn't been for Gordon Brown's personal intervention \"all the jobs would have gone\". Alex Salmond has suggested he could have saved the <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idUKLI13023720080918\">Scottish bank</a> if Scotland had been independent. </p> <p>Labour says that's nationalist pie in the sky. And it is certainly hard to see how a small country like Scotland could have mustered the billions necessary to bail out one of the biggest banks in the world. Mind you it's not at all clear that the UK government could have financed a rescue either. This is a global financial crisis which needs global solutions.</p> <p>The SNP leader last week attacked the <a href=\"http://news.scotsman.com/latestnews/Salmond-fury-at-39bunch-of.4503240.jp\">\"spivs and speculators\"</a> who brought Scotland's oldest bank to its knees, but Labour has pointed out gleefully that the former RBS boss, Sir George Matthewson, Salmond's leading economic adviser, is himself a hedge fund manager who engages in short selling of shares in the stock market. </p> <p>Well, spiv might not quite fit the sober Matthewson, one of the pillars of the Scottish financial establishment, and many of Gordon Brown's advisors are financiers, too. But Labour evidently believes it can portray the Nats as Tartan Tories who are in the pockets of bankers. </p> <p>\"In 1979 the SNP opened the door to Thatcher,\" sneered Gray in his conference speech referring to the SNP's role in bringing down the Callaghan government 30 years ago, and they are \"dusting off their doorman's cap to do David Cameron the same favour\". Given Gordon Brown's plaudits for Margaret Thatcher, and the fact that he literally <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6993269.stm\">opened the door </a> to her in Number Ten last year, this charge might just rebound a little. As may the claim that the SNP are cutting services in Scotland in the ideological manner pioneered by the Tories. The SNP point out that the current unprecedentedly tight public spending limits on Scottish spending are London-imposed. </p> <p>It has been Labour's enthusiastic adoption of neoliberal policies inherited from Thatcher, like deregulation in the City of London, which has arguably exposed the country to the worst of the global crash. The tax concessions for the rich have increased the pay gap between the very rich and the very poor in Britain a way that never happened even under the Tories. It is the SNP, not Labour which has called for a windfall tax on energy companies, has cut prescription charges, abolished tuition fees and introduced a range of social democratic initiatives in areas like PFI council housing.</p> <p>So it will be difficult for Labour to suddenly portray themselves as red-blooded socialists in Scotland. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2008/jul/23/ssa\">Glasgow East byelection</a>, showed that, even in its urban heartlands many of Labour's core voters believe that the SNP is now a better bet for defending their living standards than Labour under Gordon Brown. The expectation in Scotland is that the voters in Glenrothes will think so too. And that really will hurt.</p>",
  "<p>Alistair Darling pledged not to raise the basic rate of income tax and ruled out an immediate clampdown on City bonuses today, as the government continued its fightback following last week's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketturmoil\">financial turmoil</a>.</p> <p>The chancellor made the commitments ahead of his appearance at the Labour party conference this lunchtime. In his keynote speech, he warned that the UK economy faces \"very uncertain times\", but insisted that Labour would help stabilise the financial system and stop the crisis escalating.</p> <p>\"We are on a difficult road and there will be, I am afraid, bumps along the way,\" said Darling. \"The first priority is to stabilise the banking system. If we don't the whole world economy is at risk.\"</p> <p>Earlier today, the chancellor admitted that the economic slowdown means the government will probably have to borrow more to balance the books, but promised that he will not raise the basic rate of income tax, which is currently 20p in the pound.</p> <p>\"We have a manifesto commitment on the basic rate of tax, and it is one that I intend to stick to,\" Darling pledged in an interview on the BBC's Today programme.</p> <p>The chancellor also weighed into the debate around City pay, winning applause from conference delegates when he declared that \"we need to look at the culture of huge bonuses which have distorted the way decisions are made. Bonuses should encourage good long-term decisions, not short-term reckless ones.\"</p> <p>But an imminent clampdown appears unlikely, in the light of Darling's performance on Today, where he refused to back any \"kneejerk\" moves on pay.</p> <p>\"You need to remain level-headed and avoid kneejerk reactions and saying things that don't look so good in a few weeks time,\" said Darling.</p> <p>Bonuses are under scrutiny in the light of the credit crunch, which has forced <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/lehmanbrothers\">Lehman Brothers into bankruptcy</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/merrilllynch\">Merrill Lynch</a> to be sold to Bank of America, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/22/wallstreet.morganstanley\">Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs to ditch their status as investment banks</a>.</p> <p>Gordon Brown fuelled speculation of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/22/executivesalaries.gordonbrown\">a pay clampdown</a> over the weekend when he said that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/interactive/2008/sep/19/1\">the panic in the world's stockmarkets</a> last week was caused by \"irresponsibility\" and short-term bonuses that bore no relation to long-term profits.</p> <p>Darling acknowledged today that some bankers had been encouraged to take risks that had proved \"disastrous\" for their companies, but cautioned that: \"Banks will always take risks, and that's right and proper ... We need to toughen up the system, but in a way that works.\"</p> <p><strong>Weaknesses in the financial system</strong></p> <p>After a week that rocked stockmarkets around the world, the chancellor told the party conference in Manchester today that he is determined to take steps to deal with weaknesses in the financial system, in partnership with other politicians around the world.</p> <p>\"Just as no government on its own can combat global terrorism or tackle climate change, no government alone can put in place the right supervisory safeguards in this global economy,\" he said.</p> <p>Pay and taxation are likely to be central themes at the Labour party conference this week, with some leftwingers pushing for a new 45% tax band for individuals earning more than \u00a3175,000 a year, which could fund tax cuts for other workers.</p> <p>Tomorrow, the prime minister will attempt to reinvigorate his premiership with his own speech to the conference. He is expected to make financial turmoil a key theme, calling for better regulation at home and abroad to avoid a repeat of the mistakes that led to the credit crunch.</p> <p>The latest opinion polls indicate that the government is heading for a wipeout at the next election, but Darling insisted that the cabinet was still united behind Brown.</p> <p>\"All of us know that it is important that Gordon tomorrow sets out his vision of what the Labour government and the Labour party stands for - the difference that having our government as opposed to a Tory government will make to the country,\" he told the BBC.</p> <p>\"Many people have had their criticisms but Gordon knows where he stands. He is a man of conviction, and also a man of considerable resolution. He will set out very clearly tomorrow his clear sense of direction, and that's what people want to hear,\" Darling added.</p> <p><strong>'Fat-cats' face curbs</strong></p> <p>The new chairman of the Financial Services Authority, Lord Turner, is making the issue of so-called \"fat-cat pay\" a top priority. Yesterday he said it was important to ask \"searching questions\" about remuneration policy, and to \"ask questions of institutions as to whether they are paying out bonuses before they are sure whether the profits are really there or whether a toxic problem ... has been created for the future.\"</p> <p>One option for the FSA would be to force banks with particularly generous bonus schemes to hold more capital in reserve, to protect against unexpected losses on complex trading positions turning sour.</p> <p>In London, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/19/wallstreet.banking\">the excitement following America's $700bn (\u00a3378bn) bailout of the banking sector</a> appeared to have worn off this morning. The FTSE 100 index, which leapt by 451 points on Friday, was down 5 points at 5306.3 by 11.30am.</p> <p>While HSBC fell by 3.3%, other banking shares were in positive territory following the introduction of a ban on short-selling financial stocks.<br> In Asia there was more optimism overnight, with Japan's Nikkei index closing 1.4% higher. The Chinese Shanghai index surged by 7.7%, thanks to government moves to shore up investor confidence.</p>",
  "<p>Over the past 10 days, many of those deeply involved in the world's financial meltdown have been hitting one site: <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/\">The Wall Street Journal</a>. Although it aspires to be America's national paper, it is at its most compelling during crises, when it's more like a local paper for New York's financial district. If you want \"the word on the Street\", there is nothing like being there.</p> <p>Whether the crisis hit The Wall Street Journal at the best or the worst of times for the paper is another matter. Last Tuesday, when traffic was surging to an all-time high of 2m visitors, the site was relaunched with a massive redesign. Whatever the technical challenge, it survived.</p> <p>I loved the old plain text site, which reflected the old plain text newspaper. Being contrarian by nature, I loved the Journal for running long complex stories instead of following the tabloid fashion for dumbing stuff down into 50-word chunks. I loved it for illustrating articles with small, pseudo-engraved mugshots (called hedcuts) instead of photographs. I loved it for using the same front page layout for 50 years.</p> <p>But times are changing. The paper launched a weekend edition in 2005, discovering \"lifestyles\" and glossy photography, and a year ago Dow Jones, the parent company, was taken over by Rupert Murdoch. The new website is also glossier, has photos and videos on the front page, and includes a <a href=\"http://magazine.wsj.com/\">luxury magazine</a>. There's even a Mobile Reader service, albeit only for the BlackBerry.</p> <p>And now we also have Journal Community, in beta test form. Like Facebook, it lets you create a profile page based on your real identity (\"The quality of conversations can deteriorate when real identities are not provided.\") As a logged-in subscriber, you can make connections, join or start discussion groups, ask or answer questions, and comment on stories. You can also personalise your front page, and select from lots of news and market alerts and newsletters, all delivered via email.</p> <p>One objection is that the Journal is only open to those who pay: currently $119 a year. But getting on for a million of us do, and as elite clubs go, this is cheap. However, the Journal is sensitive to being left out of \"the conversation in the blogosphere\", and now makes lots of general stories available free. It also has technology columns and other tech stories at a separate, openly accessible site, <a href=\"http://allthingsd.com/\">D: All Things Digital</a>. </p> <p>WSJ.com's other \"family members\" include Market Watch and Barron's, which are stock market oriented, and Virtual Stock Exchange, a game. There are also global sites such as WSJ Asia and WSJ Europe, plus versions in different languages.</p> <p>WSJ.com is clearly trying to attract a more general, more casual, non-paying readership \u2013 people like you. It certainly looks nicer, but it also looks more like any other newspaper site. The problem is that it feels a lot slower, which is bad for the professional, information-seeking readership \u2013 people like me. Anybody who thinks we're paying $119 a year for pretty pictures has lost the plot.</p>",
  "<p>As the UK is failing to expand its green industries, we are also losing out on new sustainable jobs in this time of economic instability.</p> <p>In the current economic climate it's important we don't overlook opportunities for sustainable job creation. </p> <p>Some startling figures demonstrate this point. The UK is the windiest country in the European Union with around <a href=\"http://www.bwea.com/media/news/070813.html\">40% of the EU's total wind capacity</a>, yet we produce little more than 4% of the EU's wind energy. </p> <p>This massive under-utilisation of our green resources is also reflected in job figures. According to government-sponsored research, the UK has, at very best, 26,000 jobs in renewable energy. By contrast, Germany has 250,000 jobs. </p> <p>With the right investment, the UK has the wind resources to be a European green industry leader. As well as reducing carbon emissions and increasing energy security, wind power also creates a large number of jobs per TWh unit. </p> <p>While nuclear produces 75 jobs per TWh per year, oil and gas around 250 jobs, <a href=\"http://www.neweconomics.org/gen/uploads/sewyo355prhbgunpscr51d2w29062005080838.pdf\">wind produces up to 2,400 jobs</a>.</p> <p>The government's own research shows that investing in wind could generate 43,000 new green jobs. This depends on developing turbine manufacturing in the UK. Without a major focus on developing that industry, these projections shrink to less than 7,000 jobs. </p> <p>The government's recently-launched <a href=\"http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file47660.pdf\">New Challenges, New Opportunities report (pdf)</a><br>reviews the manufacturing industry and provided an opportunity to prioritise investment in new green jobs and skills in green manufacturing. But the report sorely disappoints by prioritising investment in nuclear before renewables; leaving another environmental debt for future generations.</p> <p>The EU is pushing the UK to do more on true renewable energy, partly as a result of legislation influenced by Green MEPs from across Europe. The government describes the UK's target of producing 15% of our total energy consumption from renewable sources by 2020 as \"very challenging\". But to put that in context, Romania's target is 24% and Sweden's is 49%. In fact, most EU member states have higher 2020 renewable energy targets than the UK. </p> <p>Simply put, progress on the green agenda is being delayed by Government timidity and lack of forward thinking.</p> <p>Would the Tories be any better? David Cameron and Boris Johnson both expend their own form of renewable energy on two wheels, so perhaps. But Boris Johnson has so far put a cuts agenda ahead of the environment at City Hall. He has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/08/boris.london\">cancelled</a> a fleet of hydrogen cell buses and is putting up <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/04/london.transport\">bus and tube fares</a>. Future commitments to a range of London green initiatives, secured by Green party assembly members, are now in question: his example is hardly leading the way.</p> <p>As I argue in Green Work: Employment and skills \u2013 the climate change challenge, <a href=\"http://www.jeanlambertmep.org.uk/DocumentStore/GreenWork_report.pdf\">new report (pdf)</a>, the European Union could do much more. It needs to combine its Lisbon Agenda jobs priorities with its climate change strategy and work on training and skills. In this way EU funds could more readily aid investment in jobs and skills and help tackle climate change at the same time.</p> <p>On October 1, as a result of the <a href=\"http://www.diag.org.uk/\">Energy Performance of Buildings Directive</a> every domestic property offered for rent or sale in the UK will require an energy assessment. This huge task will need an army of energy assessors. A significant proportion of the housing stock is still uninsulated, with 9m UK homes in need of cavity wall insulation and 12m needing loft insulation. In London alone, that's over<br><a href=\"http://www.jeanlambertmep.org.uk/DocumentStore/Hothouses.pdf\">1m cavity walls and 1.5m lofts (pdf)</a>.</p> <p>It won't be a solution to all our problems, but a wide-scale free insulation programme could reduce energy bills by a third and slash carbon emissions. It would also create huge numbers of green jobs.</p> <p>There is massive potential for green jobs and training, but it's unclear whether the UK is ready to seize this opportunity. We have a serious green skills deficit and public investment in green training is sorely needed if we are to meet the climate change challenge and our green EU obligations. </p> <p>The green agenda is intrinsically linked to jobs, skills and economic issues. It will fail if not fully integrated into relating strategies and it must not be set up as a straw man in opposition to them. As the green work agenda becomes increasingly relevant, failure on green issues will also mean failure in terms of sustainable jobs, skills and investment in industry and manufacturing.</p> <p>The important work, the green work, still needs to be done.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bradfordbingley\">Bradford &amp; Bingley</a> was today being tipped by City analysts as the next bank to surrender its independence, sending its shares soaring 17% on hopes of a takeover bid.</p> <p>The bank is Britain's last remaining standalone mortgage lender, following <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/allianceleicester\">the takeover of Alliance &amp; Leicester</a> by Santander and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/northernrock\">the nationalisation of Northern Rock</a>. Its shares were bolstered by reports that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/regulators\">the Financial Services Authority</a> was dusting down contingency plans that might involve it being taken over by a larger, stronger bank.</p> <p>Three foreign banks \u2013 Santander, ING and NAB \u2013 had been reported as potential suitors although the City believes they may be reluctant to step forward.</p> <p>Hopes for a white knight were also raised following comments by Carla Antunes da Silva, banking analyst JPMorgan who said: \"We do not believe it is a viable standalone entity\".</p> <p>After jumping 17% in early trading, B&amp;B shares settled 10% higher at 30.5p, up 2.75p. Its shares are still down almost 90% in the last year.</p> <p>The buy-to-let specialist bolstered its capital reserves earlier this year through a protracted \u00a3400m rights issue, and insists it is well-capitalised. </p> <p>But there are still concerns over B&amp;B's ability to ride out the financial crisis in the long term, given the structural changes in the money markets.</p> <p>\"With securitisation markets showing no signs of returning this will question the viability of a bank like B&amp;B and going forward the costs for monoliners such as B&amp;B will put them at a significant disadvantage. We are also concerned by the pick up in arrears we have seen, especially given the rapidly deteriorating UK macro environment,\" Da Silva said.</p> <p>Alex Potter, an analyst at Collins Stewart, believes the FSA is desperate to avoid a repeat of the drama surrounding HBOS, which is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/19/hbosbusiness.lloydstsbgroup1\">being taken over by Lloyds TSB</a>.</p> <p>\"One of the things the events surrounding HBOS in the past week have taught us is that a share price can clearly impact on the ability of a bank to source liquidity and fund its balance sheet. The FSA, having watched this happen to the UK's largest mortgage lender, is clearly nervous that the same thing may happen to one of the sector's minnows,\" Potter said.</p> <p>Last week, rating agency Moody's downgraded B&amp;B, which will push up its borrowing costs.</p> <p>Sandy Chen, an analyst at City stockbrokers Panmure Gordon, warned that he expects B&amp;B to make bigger losses this year, and slashed his share price target from 20p to just 7p.</p> <p>\"The press reports that the government is looking for a white knight for B&amp;B \u2013 and the absence of any such bidders so far - adds to the uncertainty about B&amp;B's future.\"</p> <p>\"Our concern is that significant retail deposit outflows may occur, forcing B&amp;B to rely even more heavily on expensive wholesale funding,\" Chen added.</p>",
  "<p>From the manner of the reaction at Valhalla you might think that the US press would have pictures of the Ryder Cup plastered all over the nation's front pages this morning, but there were a lot of other stories competing for the headlines, not least the final game at Yankee Stadium and the weekend's gridiron. </p> <p>Inside the back pages the Ryder Cup coverage itself was less crowingly smug than might have been expected, one or two digs aside. </p> <p>The <em>Chicago Tribune</em> pointed out that \"Europe's big three \u2013 Sergio Garc\u00eda, Lee Westwood and Padraig Harrington went a combined 0-7-5\" and picked their combined performance out as the biggest single reason for Europe's defeat. The same paper was gracious enough to point out that \"Nick Faldo will get flogged in the European press for bypassing Colin Montgomerie and Darren Clarke and for backloading his singles lineup. But, c'mon. Ian Poulter, one of his picks, earned four of Europe's 11\u00bd points.\" </p> <p>Most articles though concentrated on the invigorated US performance, with the majority of correspondents attributing it to the presence of the rookies in the side, and Boo Weekley and Anthony Kim in particular. </p> <p><em>The Washington Post</em> said: \"Kim set the tone for the American side as Azinger's lead-off golfer, matched against Garcia. The flamboyant 23-year-old native of Los Angeles not only rose to the occasion, he practically soared to a stunning 5&amp;4 victory, the most lopsided triumph by an American Cup rookie since 1999.\" </p> <p>On <em>ESPN.com</em>, Pat Forde praised Weekley's clowning contribution and his \"Happy Gilmore dance\" down the first fairway in particular, \"riding his driver between his legs and whipping it like a quarter horse. It was completely preposterous. And it was totally, wonderfully Weekley.</p> <p>\"Don't think victory at Valhalla wasn't spurred in large part by a daily dose of Weekley levity. Don't think his act didn't play perfectly with the predominantly Southern crowd that turned this compelling three-day golf match into an SEC football game.</p> <p>\"The fans took their cue from Boo,\" Forde continued, warming to his theme, \"the arm-waving, fist-clenching, tobacco-chewing, shot-making, cheerleading, Westwood-frosting, syntax-fracturing tour de force at this Ryder Cup. Book smart? No. Course smart? Yes. The favorite of every American golf fan today? Yeah, buddy.\" </p> <p>The <em>New York Times</em> attributed the US victory to a broader mix of factors: \"The heavily favoured European team lost because of a determined and enthusiastic group of motivated newcomers, newly energised veterans like Furyk and a creative captain in Azinger.\"</p> <p>The <em>Chicago Tribune</em> mused: \"Maybe the message was complex. Or maybe it was simple. Relish the underdog role. Play loose. Make the red-white-and-blue crowd the 13th man. Don't worry about who's not here. Support your team-mates. Take it one shot at a time.\"</p> <p><em>USA Today</em> was happy to revel in the fact that the monkey was finally of the back of the US team. \"In the prairies and backwoods of the Bluegrass State, the Americans finally emerged from an international match-play forest where they had lost five of last six meetings, including blow-outs in 2004 and 2006 that left cynics questioning the commitment and passion for the Ryder Cup. That criticism won't fly anymore.\"</p>",
  "<p>The very latest birdwatching destination has been unveiled, offering the jaded British birder the perfect combination of sun, sand \u2013 and of course birds. This new location even has its own unique species, guaranteed to set the pulse of every keen birder racing. </p> <p>Just one tiny little problem: the species is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basra_Reed_Warbler\">Basra reed warbler</a>, and the destination is southern Iraq. </p> <p>The suggestion by Britain's consul general for the region, Nigel Hayward, that the area around <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/2982493/Iraq-to-promote-its-tourist-potential.html\">Basra could become a birding hotspot</a>, isn't quite as far-fetched as it sounds. <br><br>His claim that \"we are on major bird migration routes\" is spot-on. Iraq in particular, and the Middle East in general, are slap-bang in the middle of the world's largest avian flyway, with hundreds of millions of migrating birds from Europe and Asia funnelling through to and from their winter-quarters in Africa every spring and autumn. Even the Old Testament prophets knew this, as the book of Jeremiah reveals:</p> <blockquote> <p>Yea, the stork in the heavens knoweth her appointed times; and the turtle [dove] and the swallow and the crane observe the time of their coming.</p> </blockquote> <p>As well as this wealth of migrants, southern Iraq also offers the tantalising possibility of an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_(ecology)\">endemic species</a> - that is, one found nowhere else in the world. According to the ornithologists' Bible, BWP (<a href=\"http://www.oup.co.uk/academic/science/ornithology/bwp/\">Birds of the Western Palearctic</a>), the eponymous <a href=\"http://www.birdlife.info/wbdbwebstaging/SpcHarnessDetails.asp?sid=7609&amp;m=0\">Basra reed warbler</a> breeds only in Iraq and Kuwait, with a tiny population recently discovered in <a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/news/news/2007/08/basra_israel.html\">Israel's Hula Valley</a>. This anonymous looking warbler then heads south to spend the winter months in east Africa, before returning to the world's worst trouble-spot to raise a family.<br> <br>The two Gulf wars have not been good news for this species: <a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/\">Birdlife International</a> has upgraded its global status from \"near threatened\" to \"endangered\" as a result of the ongoing hostilities, which have led to <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/05/0521_030521_iraqbirds.html\">the loss of much of the warbler's wetland habitat</a>. </p> <p>If the Basra reed warbler is seen at all in Iraq, the observer is most likely to be a serving soldier. One US national guardsman, Jonathan Trouern-Trend, has even compiled his birding experiences into a book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Birding-Babylon-Soldiers-Journal-Iraq/dp/1578051312\">Birding Babylon</a>. Not quite the saucy revelations of its Hotel Babylon namesake, but a fascinating read nonetheless. </p> <p>Hailing from Connecticut, Trend brings a delightfully fresh eye to his <a href=\"http://10000birds.com/birding-babylon-a-soldiers-journal-from-iraq.htm\">experiences with the country's birds</a>. As he does so, he follows in a long tradition of soldier-birders, including <a href=\"http://www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/ltg/projects/jtap/tutorials/intro/sassoon/\">Siegfried Sassoon</a>, whose wartime experiences make compelling reading, as I documented in my book on the social history of birdwatching, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bird-Bush-Social-History-Birdwatching/dp/1845130855\">A Bird in the Bush</a>. </p> <p>But even by the most optimistic estimates, birding trips to Iraq are unlikely to happen for another five years or more. So where can danger-seeking birders get their kicks in the meantime? Two leading bird tour companies, <a href=\"http://www.limosaholidays.co.uk/ \">Limosa</a> and <a href=\"http://www.sunbirdtours.co.uk/index.php\">Sunbird</a>, travel to some pretty offbeat destinations, with Sunbird's trip to Georgia offering an \"exciting tour\u2026 to one of the most mysterious, unique and scenic countries in the Western Palearctic, where you will see some of its most sought after and rarely seen birds.\" </p> <p>Limosa's trips to Uzbekistan and \"Wild Mongolia\" also offer something a bit different for the thrill-seekers among us. </p> <p>And birders do run risks, even in far more innocuous places. Like the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/12/newsid_2518000/2518385.stm\">plane spotters arrested</a> as \"spies\" in Greece a few years ago, birders regularly get into trouble for walking around with high-powered optics near sensitive military sites. </p> <p>Almost two decades ago I took a memorable trip around the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negev\">Negev Desert</a> with top Israeli birder <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadoram_Shirihai\">Hadoram Shirihai</a>, whose reputation for occasionally leading visiting birders through minefields was not entirely undeserved. </p> <p>On a more serious note, there have been occasions when birders' single-minded obsession with <a href=\"http://www.backyardnature.net/birdlist.htm\">adding a new species to their life list</a> has resulted in their premature demise. The most infamous case was back in the early 1990s, when two young British birders <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fWLmpqL4EMsC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;dq=Timothy+Andrews+Michael+Entwistle+Peru&amp;source=web&amp;ots=cd8wFHm3m7&amp;sig=y_vSwfJuvgbc1IsuJmtKqI695S8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result\">strayed into the territory of the Shining Path guerrillas</a> in Peru, and were captured and eventually killed. </p> <p>Such tragic events are mercifully rare, but should inject a note of caution into the mind of anyone with plans to go birding in Iraq \u2013 even with the Basra reed warbler as their reward.</p>",
  "<p>We are told that the economic crisis is a global problem, nothing to do with the UK \u2013 it simply blew in unexpectedly from the US. Nonsense. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/19/subprimecrisis.richardbitner\">subprime housing market</a> crisis certainly blew up first in the US, but all the makings of the crisis were already deeply embedded in UK and European financial markets and would have blown up here without any promptings from the US. The de-regulatory, free-wheeling market agenda was already as strongly installed in the City of London as in the US; securitisation was as rampant in the City as on Wall Street, and UK mortgages were increasingly being marketed in the UK on a 6:1, even 10:1, debt to income ratio. The US has nothing to teach the City about subprime or about arcane derivatives.</p> <p>Second, the left cannot contain itself with glee over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/22/wallstreet.marketturmoil\">Hank Paulson's</a> \"nationalisation\" of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/freddiemacandfanniemae\">Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae</a>, AIG, and the state-run <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/21/useconomy.subprimecrisis\">Resolution Trust Corporation</a>, designed to sweep up the crippled Wall Street failures under the protective wing of the state. Private market Armageddon, and state control triumphant. It is nothing of the kind.</p> <p>Actually it reveals the reverse. Once the finance catastrophe is past (which may take a year or two) and all the colossal banking losses have been safely socialised with the taxpayer, the private market will re-present itself \u2013 slightly reconfigured no doubt by some minimalist re-regulation \u2013 as the natural delivery mechanism for the next splurge of global capitalist growth. Whatever limitations have been placed by Gordon Brown's \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/22/gordonbrown.economy\">cleaning up the City</a>\", the race will then be on to find a way round them and to renew the culture of mega-bonuses for the few at the expense of the many. After 1929 and the second world war, it happened in the 1950-60s until it was stopped by the oil shocks of 1971-3, then it happened again in the 1980s until the US savings and loans associations crumbled between 1989-95, and then it took off again with the securitisation scam until the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/northernrock\">Northern Rock</a> collapse on August 9 2007.</p> <p>It will start yet again within the next five years because the culture has not changed one jot and the driving force remains maximum enrichment by the largest amalgamations of capital (increasingly in the hands of secretive private equity and hedge funds uninhibited by even the limited transparency of public companies), shielded by their close harmony with political leaders. All the US nationalised companies with be returned to the private sector as quickly as feasible, as will Northern Rock. Public ownership is seen as a despised necessity, an unfortunate interregnum in the endless drive for private profit, and a temporary refuge to be milked for all it is worth for as little time as it is required. Hardly a triumph for those who believe in it. </p> <p>Instead of the left preening itself that this capitalist debacle leaves events falling into its lap, it needs to realise that there is still a mountain to climb before the culture is transformed. The intellectual conspirators of St Pelerin in Geneva in 1947 took over 30 years to get their neoliberal philosophy to take root. The left today have hardly started. The need for a profound, wide-ranging, persisting, in-depth intellectual and political debate on the realities of an alternative world economic order has never been greater.</p>",

  "<p>Is the Labour conference in Manchester engaged in collective delusion this week? Or are they on to something? All over the fringe meeting circuit, in white wine receptions and on street corners, you bump into people who believe the global financial crisis has changed the political dynamics in Britain.</p> <p>In other words, Gordon Brown has been given a chance to start again, to show his mettle as a highly experienced ex-finance minister, much more respected abroad than he now is at home. Who else among the Labour wannabes can claim as much? Which Tory can? </p> <p>\"David Miliband wouldn't get more than 27 votes among MPs; I've done the sums,\" one irate northern backbench loyalist told me on Manchester's Oxford Road early this morning. There are plenty such chats to be had. \"The economics have changed the politics,\" as one minister puts it.</p> <p>So, after tomorrow's conference speech, Brown flies off to New York to grapple with senior US officials like Treasury secretary, Hank Paulson, on how best to stabilise leaky financial vessels in Europe and America. Post-conference criticism and remaining talk of a coup will thus be muted or nullified, so runs the argument.</p> <p>Conversely, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/20/economy.labour\">Brown's weekend article in the Guardian</a> underscored, the financial drama is supposed to put the Tories on the back foot. In opposition you have to be quite nimble to remain on the right side of an argument. David Cameron and George Osborne have been all over the place. Being the party of the free market is going to be tricky when markets have had a train crash \u2013 or are out binge drinking, as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8f40t8MoHI\">George Bush almost put it</a>.</p> <p>That need not be fatal, of course. Brown himself supported Britain's doomed membership of the European exchange rate mechanism in the early 90s, but escaped from the rubble when it crashed in 1992. John Major didn't.</p> <p>It is all wishful conjecture, but a useful reminder that a lot can happen to upend sensible predictions between now and election day. I am reinforced in my belief that, barring a serious disaster, Brown will remain PM until his tryst with the voters. </p> <p>The noisy revolt of 10 days ago has subsided, the deadline for Brown's last chance is drifting again, from tomorrow's speech, past the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/glenrothes\">Glenrothes byelection</a> in November, on towards next June's EU elections. </p> <p>So-called \"Blairite\" plotters - it is actually much more complicated than that - are said to be gearing up to tell GB to go quite soon and threaten resignation if he doesn't. Maybe, but a word of warning is needed here. At least one Sunday newspaper used to be famous for reporting what the Brownites <em>thought</em> Tony Blair and his mates were up to rather than what they were actually doing at the time. The habit persists.</p> <p>I attended the Progress rally in Manchester's exquisite neo-gothic town hall last night. My colleague <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/johnharris\">John Harris</a> notes the energy present, though it was not explicitly Blairite, more that of ministers who suddenly felt fresh wind in their sails.</p> <p>It's true Progress was always a Blairish vehicle, but politics morph under the pressure of events. \"New Labour is not a faction,\" David Miliband told the rally, whose final speaker was the very Brownite Yvette Cooper - more confident, incidentally, than I have ever seen her. </p> <p>\"The events of the last week have fundamentally changed the debate,\" Cooper told the well-scrubbed crowd. With a nod to Cameron-Osborne's ventures into progressive politics (the Guardian's series seeking to explain them, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/series/newtories\">The new Tories</a>, has angered many Labour loyalists here) the Treasury No 2 later added: \"Nudge politics were blown away by the events of last week. We cannot nudge speculators away from short selling in fragile markets.\"</p> <p>It remains a fragile political market too. But I was intrigued to hear Brown's elections coordinator, Douglas Alexander, addressing a fringe meeting organised by Unite (or Disunite as the wags call it; the merged union's leaders do not get on), talking about organisation.</p> <p>The pollster, Deborah Mattinson, had just reminded them that Unite's membership profile is older and overwhelmingly more male that the electorate at large, especially so when compared with lapsed Labour voters \u2013 60% of whom are women.</p> <p>But all voters are now concerned over the economy and this is where Brown's experience scores over Cameron - liked, but not yet trusted, according to Mattinson's focus groups, who keep bringing up that incident in 2006 with the bike and the chauffeured car.</p> <p>If Unite activists can get their members out to vote, a major task these days, that would be something, she added, especially younger members. Apparently if someone fails to vote at their first opportunity and then does not vote in two succeeding elections they never vote. A tight contest like 1992 (78% turnout) helps, compared with a walkover like 2001 (59%), the pollster noted.</p> <p>Back to Alexander, whose defeat in the 2007 Scottish devolution elections remains a mark against him, though his defenders say he pulled Labour back from the hopeless position the local leadership bequeathed when he arrived.</p> <p>He told the meeting that Labour had picked up important campaign insights from the New Democrats of the Clinton-and-after years. First, the need to create new communication tools, a war room and rebuttal units to deal with the emerging 24/7 media. Second, the targeting of key groups of voters through phone banks and other direct means of approach, in contrast to traditional methods - the megaphone in the street, the party election broadcast, the big poster - which Alexander described as the \"disruptive model\", no longer effective when voters have so much multi-channel information and so many means of screening it out.</p> <p>Labour has been watching Barack Obama's use of the internet, not just to raise huge sums in often small donations, but also to \"invert the base\" by giving local supporters whatever local information the centre has acquired \u2013 and letting the grassroots campaign use it as it judges best.</p> <p>It was this that allowed the Illinois senator to overwhelm Hillary Clinton's machine in the primaries, not Obama's eloquent speeches alone, Alexander seemed to be saying.</p> <p>Local empowerment for electoral purposes \u2026 now there's a thought for a centralised country like ours. Alexander insisted that Labour had spent what little spare funds it had remaining \"competitive\" with the Tories and Lib Dems on computer software, with Nick Clegg's phone-bank exercise to 250,000 voters after his Bournemouth conference speech an example of opposition tactics.</p> <p>He also told a story I hadn't heard before. When Karl Rove, known as \"Bush's brain\", predicted in 2000 that his boss had won the popular vote it was a shock to discover later that he hadn't. Even though the courts ruled for Bush, Al Gore won the most votes. </p> <p>Why? Because the Democrats had mobilised their vote in the final 72 hours. To discover why, the Republicans had to go back to George McGovern's campaign against Richard Nixon in 1972, a campaign that failed badly but brought out the activists. </p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/michaeltomasky\">Michael Tomasky</a> has been reporting in the Guardian this autumn, Obama has a huge network of local campaign offices - three times John McCain's. His hunch is that voters will believe people they know more than they believe the media narrative.</p> <p>And Obama has been given a lift by the drama on Wall Street. So election wonks like Alexander will be watching his campaign more intensely than ever. So will Cameron's team. We are living through interesting times.</p>",

  "<p>Brendan Barber, the leader of the TUC, today championed Gordon Brown as the man best placed to steer Britain through \"tough times\".</p> <p>Addressing the Labour conference in Manchester this morning, Barber put aside key policy differences between trade unions and the government to back Brown's \"wisdom and experience\".</p> <p>Citing the key challenges facing Britain in \"getting to grips\" with the global economic turmoil and securing fairness for workers and their families in the face of rising prices, Barber said Brown was the best man to draw up a \"compelling\" new narrative.</p> <p>The TUC general secretary said: \"It is at times like these, where new ways forward have to be fashioned not just at home but on a global level, that our country most needs the wisdom and experience of this Labour government \u2013 led by Gordon.</p> <p>\"Gordon has - more than anyone - led the world in facing up to the injustice and oppressions of global poverty.

And, in these troubled times, those deeply rooted values of fairness will be most needed to chart our course forward.\"</p> <p>Barber smoothed over the tensions between unions and the Labour government over issues such as public sector pay and the call for a windfall tax as he insisted that the alliance between the two wings of the Labour movement \"is stronger than ever \u2013 and more important than ever\".</p> <p>Though the TUC is not affiliated to the Labour party, Barber said he was proud of their shared history, values and commitments, he said.</p> <p>\"We will inevitably have our disagreements.

And it's during the hard times, like now, that the enduring strength of our relationship matters most.\"</p> <p>Unions are set to have a public showdown over the government's measures to tackle fuel poverty later today.</p> <p>Unions want the government to introduce a windfall tax on the profits of energy companies \u2013 a move categorically ruled out earlier today by the chancellor, Alistair Darling. </p> <p>Barber cited the 60th anniversary of the creation of the NHS, and the upcoming 10th anniversary of the introduction of the minimum wage, as \"reasons for celebration\".</p> <p>\"All progressive causes that we advanced by working together,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The British people are crying out for a change of direction - one that curbs the excesses of the market, that prioritises fairness, and that demonstrates clearly and unambiguously that the government is really on their side.

  "<p>In her yearly assessment of the state of our proud little Dutch nation Queen Beatrix mentioned all sorts of trivialities last week. In a nutshell: economy pretty good, war in Afghanistan necessary, crime bad. But she failed to mention the most important thing of all: the state of Dutch football. </p> <p>The first days of Champions League and UEFA Cup action painted a picture more grim than those in which the old Dutch masters specialized. PSV were <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_zVyw6dBTg&amp;feature=related\">battered 3-0</a> by a not overly impressive Atl\u00e9tico Madrid on Tuesday. Atl\u00e9tico striker Sergio Ag\u00fcero scored twice and had a field day against J\u00e9r\u00e9my Br\u00e9chet who confirmed that Inter were quite right to give up on him four years ago. </p> <p>\"After a hopeless 3-0 loss in a group that also contains Liverpool and Marseille, PSV may hardly hope to survive the winter in the Champions League,\" NRC Handelsblad's Koen Greven wrote. \"That can be called a painful conclusion for a club that likes to count itself among Europe's best \u2026 As the match went on, it became apparent how big the difference is between Europe's [top leagues] and the Eredivisie.\"</p> <p>On Thursday, Ajax played an appalling match against an unworthy opponent, FK Borac, who struggled to cobble two decent passes together. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7marM_-79EM\">Though Ajax went on to win 4-1</a> against the Serbian side, that their opponents even got on the scoresheet was nothing less than humiliating. On the bright side there was a stunning goal by Luis Suarez and the continued progression of recent mega purchase Miralem Sulejmani, who could well develop into a low-fat, high-octane version of Rafael van der Vaart.</p> <p>After the sobering realisation that, in European club football, the Dutch have slowly become a dwarf-nation where once we were a giant, it came time for Ajax and Feyenoord - <a href=\"http://nl.youtube.com/watch?v=saGbpLF-8IE\">who hadn't helped matters by losing to Swedish club Kalmar FF 1-0 at home on Thursday</a> - to jostle for bragging rights in Sunday's classic. </p> <p>In a deafening Kuip, <a href=\"http://www.nrc.nl/multimedia/archive/00172/3D_maas_update-groo_172063a.jpg\">which Feyenoord would like to replace with a floating stadium</a> in time for a possible Dutch-Belgian 2018 World Cup (and perhaps global warming's submerging of the Netherlands), the two best supported clubs in the nation played a riveting if fairly poor match.</p> <p>Feyenoord, whose midfield had an average age of 19, held Ajax to what was probably <a href=\"http://nl.youtube.com/watch?v=QWyXc6M83JE\">a fair 2-2 draw</a>. How the result came about, though, was anything but fair as referee Eric Braamhaar had a nightmare of a game, seemingly confusing yellow cards with red ones and penalties with dives. Jeffrey Sarpong and Klaas Jan Huntelaar twice put Ajax ahead while Jon Dahl Tomasson retorted with equalisers each time: once with a header and once through a wrongly awarded penalty, given when Michael Mols and his floppy boyband haircut were nudged allowing him to gladly embrace gravity. </p> <p>Ajax captain Huntelaar couldn't make up his mind between blaming his own team or the ref in his post-match interview. \"If you don't dare give a penalty or a red card [against Feyenoord] I wonder what you're doing here,\" he finally decided. \"I'm very impressed by the poor performance of that ref.\" Yet, somehow, Braamhaar defended the indefensible. \"In my view I got it right,\" he said to virtually everyone's incredulity. </p> <p>\"The supporters' cynicism was fed by the poor showing on Thursday. Feyenoord's return to the European stage turned into a failure. The blueprint for another season of disillusion was drawn up,\" Geert Langendorff wrote in Trouw. \"[But] the tie with eternal rival Ajax brought out the best in Feyenoord \u2026 which deservedly but unexpectedly got a point from the 'classic.'\"</p> <p>\"It just doesn't look like football, what Feyenoord do,\" pundit Johan Derksen had said about Feyenoord's European misadventure earlier in the week. It hadn't looked much better on Sunday but at least there was the excuse that captain Giovanni van Bronckhorst had been injured when bumping heads with a Kalmarian. \"He's sort of seeing double,\" smiled his unconcerned manager Gertjan Verbeek before the match. \"And that's tricky isn't it? Two balls?\"</p> <p>After <a href=\"http://nl.youtube.com/watch?v=tkpUK22AyFc\">losing to Stade Rennes 2-1 in mid-week</a> Steve McClaren had proclaimed it \"not a bad result,\" before, presumably, being fitted with a straight-jacket. But on Sunday, at long last, his Twente team claimed their first win in six attempts, beating pitiful Volendam 2-1. </p> <p>And in the weekend's other big match-up Louis van Gaal's previously winless AZ handed PSV their second defeat of the week, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO3hB33x1_A\">earning a 1-0 result</a> on Saturday courtesy of a strike by Belgian Maarten Martens. </p> <p>Van Gaal, who wanted to resign midway through last season but was convinced not to by his squad, had once again been fighting for his job beforehand and many were wondering if his magic had run out. The former schoolteacher's dictatorial approach has often led to friction with the liberally raised and uninhibited Generation Y. So strict was his control at Ajax that he had even drawn up rules for every position. Wingers for example were never to try to dribble past more than one man per attack. However this was a deserved victory over what was an inferior PSV side.</p> <p>\"Like against Atl\u00e9tico and to some extent Sparta Rotterdam, PSV appeared powerless,\" De Telegraaf wrote. \"The days where everything went naturally for the Eindhovenaars, who were Dutch champions the last four years in a row, seems over for now.\" </p> <p>So it seems that, once again, though many bridges need to be built internationally, the Dutch domestic league is still more than capable of throwing up both surprises and fun in equal abundance. Now, if only our queen would notice. </p> <p><strong>Results:</strong> Feyenoord 2-2 Ajax, De Graafschap 2-0 ADO, Heervenveen 2-1 NEC, Roda JC 0-3 NAC, FC Volendam 1-2 FC Twente, AZ 1-0 PSV, Heracles 1-1 FC Groningen, Vitesse 1-1 Sparta, FC Utrecht 1-0 Willem II</p>",

He has long been one of the world's most wanted men for arms smuggling. He has a reputation for busting UN weapons embargoes to supply infamous warlords like Liberia's Charles Taylor.</p> <p>If extradited to the US and convicted he faces life imprisonment on indictments including conspiracy to kill US citizens and providing material support to terrorists.</p> <p>The charges are based on conversations recorded at a Bangkok luxury hotel in March between Bout and US Drug Enforcement Agency agents who were posing as Colombian Farc rebels. Washington lists Farc as a terrorist group.</p> <p>US prosecutors allege Bout offered to supply 700 surface-to-air missiles, guns, state-of-the-art helicopters and aircraft capable of firing missiles. The undercover agents had penetrated Bout's inner circle and won his trust, prosecutors say.</p> <p>Bout maintains he has been held unlawfully on \"fabricated American accusations\". He stands accused of being a global gun-runner to Africa, the Middle East and South America, running a fleet of cargo planes since the early 1990s.

A June hearing was cancelled when his solicitor failed to show up complaining of heart problems, while a July date went the same way when the court-appointed lawyer said he had clashing cases and did not appear.</p> <p>The hearings are due to be wrapped up by early next month when Bout's defence will get its chance to present witnesses and evidence to counter the charges.</p>",
  "<p>Britain needs to undergo a \"renaissance in nuclear power\", and coal will continue to be a \"critically important fuel\" for the country, the business secretary, John Hutton, said today.</p> <p>In an outspoken speech, designed to put pressure on the Tories as they outline restrictions on coal-fired power stations, Hutton said that the two controversial sources of energy are crucial to ensure Britain retains a secure supply of energy.</p> <p>Hutton said the international battle for energy security poses a threat to Britain's competitiveness and its \"sovereignty as a nation\".</p> <p>In his speech to the Labour conference in Manchester, he added: \"It means a renaissance in nuclear power.

Others, like the Tories, see an opportunity for pandering. But coal is critically important for the UK. Flexible. Available.

  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/23/politics.roundupreviews\">post-Cold War</a> order in Europe is finished, with Vladimir Putin its executioner. Russia's invasion of Georgia only marked its passing. Russia has emerged out of the war as a born-again 19th-century power determined to challenge the intellectual, moral, and institutional foundations of the Post-Cold War European order. </p> <p>Today, Russia and the European Union have sharply opposing views on the sources of instability in Eurasia. If the west persists in ignoring Russia's concerns and continues to expand <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/nato\"> Nato</a> in the post-Soviet space, it will merely reintroduce sphere-of-influence politics in Eurasia. But breaking with the policies of the 1990s also presents grave risks, because the EU is not, and cannot be, a traditional great power, and because the west's weakness may end up rewarding \u2013 and encouraging \u2013 Russian revanchism. </p> <p>Any rethinking of EU policy toward Russia should recognise that, while Russia will remain a regional power and global player during the next decade, it is unlikely to become a liberal democracy. The EU should also recognize that Russia has legitimate concerns about the asymmetrical impact of the Cold War's end on its security. Russia felt betrayed in its expectations that the Cold War's end would mean the demilitarisation of central and eastern Europe. While Nato enlargement did not imply any real security threats for Russia, it changed the military balance between Russia and the west, fuelling the Kremlin's revisionism. </p> <p>The contrasting nature of the political elites in Russia and Europe today is another reason for concern over the future of the relationship. Unlike the late Soviet elites, who were bureaucratic, risk-adverse, and competent when it came to international relations and security policies, the new Russian elite consists of the winners of the zero-sum games of the post-communist transition. They are highly self-confident, risk prone, and immensely wealthy, and Europe's political elites, who made their careers in practicing compromise and avoiding conflicts do not know how to deal with them. </p> <p>Indeed, whereas Russia's new assertive <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/foreignpolicy\">foreign policy</a> \u2013 a mixture of newly found strength and insecurity and of mercantilism and messianism \u2013 constitutes an existential threat for Europe, the west seems unwilling to focus on the problem of a European order. It rejects Medvedev's appeals for a new security architecture, Russia's attempt to renegotiate the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) and the OSCE's mandate and agenda on the grounds that this would constitute a retreat from the achievements of the 1990s. But how correct is this judgment? </p> <p>Today's European order emerged out of the ruins of such Cold War institutions as the CFE and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/mar/29/mainsection.guardianletters1\">OSCE</a>, and has been shaped by the EU's eastern enlargement, which was intended to help complete Europe's reunification. There was thus no immediate pressure to reinvent Europe's institutional foundation, because EU enlargement was the institutional foundation for the new European order. If you behave like us, the EU said, you will become one of us. </p> <p>But now the game has changed. The EU cannot act as guardian of the post-Cold War status quo without risking a collapse of Europe's current institutional infrastructure. It is in the EU's interest to take the initiative and to engage Russia. </p> <p>The <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/world/eu \"> EU's</a> main objective should be to preserve the distinctive character of the European order \u2013 ie, the centrality of human rights and the rule of law. It should seek to prevent the return of spheres-of-influence politics in Eurasia, rather than consolidating or expanding its own sphere of influence. Russia's neighbors \u2013 democratic and non-democratic \u2013 are Europe's natural allies in this endeavour. </p> <p>The dual nature of Russia's regime \u2013 capitalist and non-democratic, European and anti-EU \u2013 demands such a strategy. The EU should focus on the ambiguity at the heart of Russia's official doctrine of \"sovereign democracy\" and use the fact that the current Russian regime's domestic legitimacy is based, to a large extent, on the perception that it is striving to bring Russia back into European civilisation. </p> <p>True, Putin's Russia does not dream of joining the EU, but Russia's stability depends on preserving the European nature of its regime. Putin promises Russians not only restoration of the country's Great Power status, but also European living standards. Russia is ready and willing to confront Europe and the West, but it cannot afford and does not want to turn its back on Europe. </p> <p>If Russia's strategy is to erode the EU by focusing on bilateral relations with member states, the EU's priority should be to institutionalise itself as Russia's only negotiating partner. Creating institutional incentives for EU unity would help Europe overcome the asymmetrical interdependence in its relations with Russia. For example, the transformation of the OSCE into a political forum in which the EU represents its member states could be the type of institutional innovation that blocks Russia's effort to split the union. </p> <p>The EU and the United States must stop pretending that they can transform Russia, or that they can simply ignore it. But nor should the EU allow Russia to reduce it to benevolent irrelevance. </p> <p><em>Ivan Krastev is chairman of the Centre for Liberal Strategies in Sofia.</em> </p> <p>Copyright: <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\">Project Syndicate</a>/<a href=\"http://www.europesworld.org\">Europe's World</a>, 2008.</p>",
  "<p>The global financial crisis, highlighted by the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the sale of Merrill Lynch and the bailout of AIG, has wiped $50bn (\u00a327.4bn) off the value of the top global brands in the first weeks of September.</p> <p>A report by Brand Finance for MediaGuardian.co.uk, which also covers tumultuous events such as the US bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and Lloyds TSB's potential takeover of HBOS, reveals just how badly the top 100 global brands have been hit.</p> <p>Brand Finance published a report on Wednesday showing that it had taken eight months, until the end of August, for a total of $67bn to be stripped off the brand value of the top 100.</p> <p>The new report shows that $50bn has been wiped off so far in September, 80% of which was in the financial services giants.</p> <p>Brands hit include Citibank, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, UBS and AIG.

  "<p>Few infrastructure services in the developed world are taken for granted as much as electric power. To consumers in industrialised countries, uninterrupted power supply is a given. Not so in sub-Saharan Africa, which experiences some of the world's greatest power deficits, and where only two in 10 people have access to electricity. </p> <p>According to a <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/reo/2008/AFR/eng/sreo0408.htm\">recent report</a> from the International Monetary Fund Regional Economic Outlook for Sub-Saharan Africa, in 2007 alone, nearly two-thirds of the countries in the region experienced an acute energy crisis marked by frequent and extended electricity cuts. </p> <p>There is no shortage of hydropower plants for electricity generation in Africa. However, many of them are unable to keep up with rapid population growth and attendant increases in demand. Furthermore, they are prone to frequent drought, which reduces their output significantly, leaving many as little more than decorative infrastructure landmarks. Increasingly, burgeoning populations in countries like Nigeria and Ghana imply a greater extraction of water resources needed for power generation. Rapid expansion of agricultural activity is requiring more and more water all across the continent. </p> <p>Other resources like fuel oil, diesel, light crude, solar, and gas are also available as means of electricity generation, but their costs are all quite prohibitive. </p> <p>These factors make a good argument for coal as a cheap alternative source of Africa's power. Coal has historically played a crucial role as a source of energy worldwide, and has several important advantages over other fossil fuels. First is its relative abundance. The current level of proven coal reserves worldwide stands at roughly 850 billion tons. Africa has about 50 billion tons. Coal is also much more widely distributed geographically than any other fossil fuel. </p> <p>Worldwide energy demand has increased by more than 50% since 1980, and is expected to grow annually by 1.6% between now and 2030. More than 70% of this new demand will come from developing countries, with fossil fuels projected to account for about 80% of total energy demand by the end of this period. Coal is the world's fastest growing fossil fuel, with annual production increasing by 6.4% since 2004. It is already the dominant source of power generation in some very important energy-consuming nations. </p> <p>Much of the future increases in coal-fired electricity generation will come from strategically important developing countries like China and India. In 2006 alone, China added about 93,000 megawatts of coal-fired electricity generating capacity, and this trend is expected to continue as the country tries to meet its huge energy needs. </p> <p>Even in many developed countries, coal still accounts for a large share of power generation. Coal plants currently provide more than half of America's electricity supply. Denmark, which houses some of the most efficient coal-fired power plants in the world, equally relies on coal for half of its electricity production. The same is true for Germany, which is home to some of the most efficient <a href=\"http://www.undeerc.org/carrc/html/CoalCombustion.html\">pulverised coal combustion</a> units in Europe. Poland uses coal for 98% of its electricity production, and South Africa uses coal for about 50% of its electricity production. </p> <p>Against this picture then, it is hard not to expect developing countries to exploit their abundant coal resources to generate power for their own development, especially given that modern technology can help produce coal cleanly. </p> <p>Some argue that gas might be a better alternative to hydro or coal, but for countries that must import much of their gas the benefits of a stable and reliable source of cheap fuel in the form of coal present a very strong counter-argument to the capital costs of a gas plant. Unlike prices for coal, which is abundant and dispersed geographically, gas prices are subject to significant volatility, and the long-term trend in the face of fossil fuel depletion is uncertain. In contrast, coal prices are more stable, and may remain that way for a long time. </p> <p>Apart from electric-power generation, coal also has wide application in a number of industries. It is pivotal in both steel and cement production. Moreover, the use of wood by Africa's growing population is causing increasingly rapid deforestation in many countries. There is significant potential domestic demand for coal briquettes to replace wood for cooking and domestic and industrial heating. The demand outlook thus appears favorable for the coal industry, creating significant investment opportunities. </p> <p>Clearly, there are environmental drawbacks from the use of coal as an energy resource, and these concerns are far too important to overlook. The massive reserves notwithstanding, coal is still a finite resource. It must be mined with greater efficiency and with a view to mitigating the environmental impact. </p> <p>Fortunately, much greater attention is paid today to mine safety and the management of the by-products of coal use. With acid rain and other public-health hazards linked to coal combustion, more technologies are emerging for reducing harmful emissions from power plants. Fuelled by research, the past few years have witnessed the development of increasingly cleaner and more energy-efficient coal-fired generation plants and the retirement of older technologies, especially in the developed world. Developing countries have lagged behind in this process, but, with the common threat of global warming, there is now growing pressure to adopt conservation policies. </p> <p>Africa's mineral-rich countries must exploit their abundant natural resources. They must use coal to advance their economic development. Failure to do so would be a missed opportunity at a time when African countries must avail themselves of all available resources for poverty reduction. </p> <p><em>Richard Uku is a senior executive of the Africa Finance Corporation. </em></p> <p><em>Copyright: <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2008. </em></p>"
