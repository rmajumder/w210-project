  "<p>England warned yesterday that no country will be able to host the 2015 Rugby World Cup unless the organisers can ease the financial risks involved and offer nervous bidders a more affordable deal as the sport attempts to survive the global economic downturn.</p> <p>Francis Baron, the Rugby Football Union's chief executive, believes the danger lights are already flashing and is urging the International Board to reconsider its insistence that future tournament bids must be secured by a compulsory up-front fee of around \u00a370m.</p> <p>As ticket sales are the only direct source of revenue available to a host union, Baron says even the wealthiest of nations are unlikely to make a profit. \"If England are struggling to make the numbers stack up, who else is going to be able to do it?\" asked Baron.</p> <p>While England remain keen to host the 2015 event they are not assured of government support in the current financial climate, particularly with the 2012 Olympics and a possible 2018 World Cup football bid on the horizon. Bids have to be lodged by next May and Baron believes the IRB should soften its stance when the issue is discussed at the end of next month.</p> <p>\"We would like to bid for 2015 but at present we would have to consider very carefully whether it would be prudent to bid knowing we'd almost certainly incur a substantial loss.\"</p> <p>The IRB's price hike is widely seen as an attempt to make up for the anticipated financial shortfall from the 2011 tournament in New Zealand.</p> <p>The RFU have also revealed that tickets are still available for all the autumn international matches at Twickenham, including the Test against the All Blacks on November 29. Over 30,000 seats are currently still available for the visit of the Pacific Islands tomorrow week.</p>",
  "<p>Every dawn, as the day's first light filters into the sky over the English Channel, small convoys of fishing boats leave the ports of the south coast. To most inhabitants of the region's bustling towns, the fishing industry is practically invisible. Yet while less profitable than the fisheries of the North Sea, Cornwall, and Scotland, men still ply their trade in these waters as they have done for thousands of years. How much longer they'll be doing this however, is a moot point. Current fisheries policy is putting many fishermen's livelihoods under threat.</p> <p>The fleet here is dominated by inshore boats. Less than 10 metres in length, these vessels rarely venture beyond 10 miles from the coast to catch species like sole, cuttlefish, plaice, cod, bass and lobster. The boats are constrained in what they can land by their size and the power of their engines, and their owners employ fishing methods such as set-nets, traps, and lines that according to the Marine Stewardship Council <a href=\"http://www.fishonline.org/caught_at_sea/methods/Fishing_Methods_League_Table.pdf\">minimise impact</a> on the marine habitat. Perversely however, it is these fishermen that are falling victim to an unfair quota system. The local cod fishery is a case in point.</p> <p>Cod stocks have undergone an unexpected rise in British waters in the last two years. Yet along the entire coast from Kent to Dorset, boats of under 10m are not permitted to land a single cod. This is because by February of this year, the boats had reached their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/mar/25/fishing.food\">combined quota</a> for 2008 of just 55 tons. While these fishermen can continue to target other fish, they are required by law to return every cod, usually the most abundant and profitable species in the colder months, to the water. Most are dead. The larger fishing vessels and trawlers meanwhile, are free to hunt cod with impunity, as their quota allocations have not been reached. It is a similar story around Britain.</p> <p>Each year the major share of the fish and shellfish quota across the country is allocated to the powerful boats over 10 metres in length that make up just a quarter of the total fleet. And for some valuable fish just 3% of the quota is reserved for the 2,500 inshore fishing boats that make up the remaining 75% of the fleet. That the minority of boats are awarded the bulk of the permitted catch is bad enough. The fact that the fishing methods employed by the larger vessels are hugely destructive \u2013 chief among which are bottom trawling and dredging \u2013 makes it a scandal.</p> <p>Bottom trawling takes many forms but invariably involves dragging often vast nets weighted down by rollers and thick chains along the sea-bed. Dredging is similar but uses metal cages to sieve bivalves such as scallops out of the sediment. The impact of these methods has parallels with the clear-cut felling of the world's forests, killing marine life indiscriminately and leaving huge scars in the sea-bed (http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/oceans/problems/bottom-trawling). It is hugely wasteful destruction.</p> <p>According to the World Wide Fund for Nature some trawlers in the North Sea kill 7kg of marine animals to produce just 450g of marketable Dover sole. That's a by-catch rate of over 90% and most of that surplus, which includes juvenile fish and unprofitable species, is returned dead to the water. Add to this the fact that these vessels <a href=\"http://assets.panda.org/downloads/fishdishreportfinal150906.pdf\">consume</a> on average more than 2,000 litres of fuel for every tonne of flatfish landed and it paints a picture of a practice that is outdated and unsustainable. Yet rather than phasing out such fishing methods the current quota system actually encourages them at the expense of the smaller boats.</p> <p>The industrialisation of the fishing fleet has caused huge and possibly irreversible damage to our seas. It has benefited just a few wealthy trawler owners while forcing countless fishermen from the industry and leaving many coastal areas facing economic decline. The sea has always been one of Britain's greatest resources and if it is to remain so, this trend must be reversed. The solution to the problem is clear.</p> <p>From 2009 inshore boats should be allocated a greater share of the overall quota, with this increasing on a year-on-year basis. Such a policy would benefit fishermen who by necessity utilise more ecologically sensitive fishing practices, and encourage those who don't to switch. Furthermore, the smallest of the inshore boats whose impact on fish stocks are negligible should be exempt from quotas entirely, making the whole system easier to police. </p> <p>The positive news is that policy makers are beginning to think along these lines. Currently under consideration at the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is a proposal to create a new class of vessel under 6m which could operate outside the quota system. If introduced, such legislation would do much to tempt fishermen away from their trawlers.</p> <p>By encouraging the British fleet to downsize, the government will effectively phase out the use of the most destructive and wasteful fishing practices. Only this can guarantee the health of the marine environment while ensuring the long-term viability of the industry. In the meantime however, many inshore fishermen continue to struggle. Those on the south coast have been denied their principal seasonal income, and with living costs rising and wholesale fish prices falling, they face a long bleak winter while the sea they rely on continues to be blighted.</p>",
  "<p>The admission last week by former US central bank chief Alan Greenspan that his belief in unfettered free markets was misplaced appeared to merely add another note of contrition to the sorry credit crunch saga \u2013 until a reader rang to ask whether it was widely known Greenspan was benefiting financially from his mistake.</p> <p>A look through the archive throws up the story of Greenspan and the hedge fund Paulson &amp; Co. Back in January the then sage-like Greenspan, who advised presidents from Reagan to Clinton and both Bushes, was a top name for any financial company board. </p> <p>He joined Paulson as a director at a time when it was already at the top of its game. Without fanfare it was reaping the rewards of betting companies involved in sub-prime home loans would go bust. Lenders like Countrywide and Washington Mutual were on its hit list. By the end of last year the firm's billionaire boss John Paulson was hundreds of millions of pounds in profit and the winner of several industry awards.</p> <p>His next move, this time with Greenspan as a director and adviser, was batting against UK banks. In the aftermath of the short-selling scandal, which saw bets against HBOS shares almost sending the bank over the edge, the FSA demanded all hedge funds reveal their short positions or dump them. Paulson chose to reveal that he was betting almost \u00a31bn on all the UK's major banks, bar HSBC, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/24/wallstreet.marketturmoil\">dropping like stones</a>. </p> <p>So here we had a situation of financial collapse not seen for 100 years (Greenspan's words). A collapse triggered to a large extent by a loss of confidence over the value, transparency and effectiveness of a derivatives market that Greenspan helped to create and expand. He defended the widespread use of derivatives even when the likes of Warren Buffett and George Soros used words like \"toxic\" and phrases like \"weapons of financial mass destruction\" to describe them.</p> <p>Greenspan famously said in 2004: \"Not only have individual financial institutions become less vulnerable to shocks from the underlying risk factors, but also the financial system as a whole has become more resilient.\"</p> <p>Last week, he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/24/economics-creditcrunch-federal-reserve-greenspan\">conceded</a> that the global financial crisis has exposed a \"mistake\" in the free-market ideology which guided his 18-year stewardship of US monetary policy. </p> <p>He had been \"partially wrong\" in his hands-off approach towards the banking industry and admitted the credit crunch had left him in a state of shocked disbelief. \"I have found a flaw,\" said Greenspan , referring to his economic philosophy. \"I don't know how significant or permanent it is. But I have been very distressed by that fact.\"</p> <p>That he is now making money from aggressively exploiting the flaws in the system is something many people find distressing.</p> <p>I contacted Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman, Vince Cable. He was famously gloomy about prospects for our debt-fuelled boom when Greenspan (and it must be said, many other free market economists and financial commentators) was still gung-ho.</p> <p>Cable said: \"Mr Greenspan has gone from hero to zero in just a few months. He himself has had to acknowledge that he interpreted the boom period in financial markets quite wrongly, and had a horribly naive view about the ability of financial markets to cope. </p> <p>\"I would love to be a fly on the wall for any future meeting between Mr Greenspan and his successor, where the new Fed chair explains to his predecessor why he agreed to the banning of activities from which Mr Greenspan has no doubt made a great deal of money recently.\"</p> <p>Cable shied away from demanding Greenspan's resignation from Paulson.</p> <p>My colleague Andrew Clark, the Guardian's US business correspondent, contacted Dean Baker, who is co-director of the US Centre for Economic and Policy Research, and a long-time Greenspan critic.</p> <p>Baker wanted to vent his frustration, but like Cable he chose to let others demand Greenspan's resignation. He said: \"It's a source of enormous frustration for me that almost all the people responsible for this [crisis] are going to end up richer than 99% of the country.</p> <p>\"Given all the conflicts of interest we've seen in this saga, this one bothers me relatively little,\" said Baker. \"The fact that he's going to get a very nice pay cheque consulting for a firm cashing in on this doesn't seem that big a deal in the scheme of things.\"</p> <p>Greenspan may be a small sub-plot in the global credit crunch story, but his message was strong and influential. He should be forced to resign.</p>",
  "<p>Be careful what you wish for. That's one of the lessons that should be apparent as <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601072&amp;sid=a_JoutmpfL_U&amp;refer=energy\">the price of oil continues to plunge</a>. </p> <p>It's certainly true that falling oil prices are one of the few bits of good news to be had as the US heads into what will likely be a nasty recession. It will be far easier for consumers in the US and elsewhere to weather an economic downturn with oil at $60 a barrel, rather than at $145. But some analysts are suggesting that <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/10/28/business/renover2.php?WT.mc_id=glob_mrktg_lead&amp;WT.mc_ev=click\">oil could fall to $50 per barrel</a>, or even lower, and stay at that level for months or even years to come. Such a sustained period of low oil prices could hurt the long-term interests of both the EU and the US. </p> <p>First, cheap crude will likely short-circuit the push for renewable energy, increase greenhouse gas emissions and slow the push for greater fuel efficiency. We've seen this happen before. The surge in oil prices that occurred after the 1973 oil embargo didn't last. As prices softened, so, too, did the interest in solar power, wind power and other technologies. The best hope for the renewable energy sector is a sustained period of high prices for fossil fuels of all types, from coal and oil to natural gas. </p> <p>As for climate change, we can argue all day about the appropriate level of global carbon dioxide emissions. But if policymakers really want to decrease carbon dioxide emissions, cheap oil is the last thing they should want, as low-cost motor fuel will allow the US, as well as developing countries like China and India, to keep pounding on the gas pedal. In China, some <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1850413,00.html?xid=feed-yahoo-biztech\">25,000 new cars per day</a> are hitting that country's roads. By 2013, the International Energy Agency expects the number of motor vehicles around the world to increase to some 1.2bn. The more cheap fuel there is, the more those vehicles will be used and the more carbon dioxide gets pumped into the atmosphere.</p> <p>Cheap crude could short-circuit the push for greater automotive fuel efficiency, both in the US and elsewhere. Motorists respond to high fuel prices. Over the past two years or so, as gasoline prices soared, sales of more fuel-efficient cars jumped dramatically. If crude (and therefore, gasoline) prices continue to fall, US motorists are more likely to continue driving big cars, pickups and SUVs. </p> <p>A collapse in oil prices would also hammer America's domestic oil and gas sector. We've seen this before, too. In the early 1980s, the smart people in the energy business were convinced that high prices were here to stay. That illusion ended with the oil price crash of 1986, after which drilling rigs and valuable oil field equipment was cut up and sold for scrap. Skilled oilfield workers left the industry for good. Today, the global energy sector continues to struggle with a shortage of skilled talent for nearly all segments of the business, from engineers to welders. A collapse in prices will result in a replay of the 1980s when skilled workers fled the oil and gas business for other industries and never returned. </p> <p>A collapse in oil prices would increase US reliance on foreign oil, as well. Once again, we've seen this happen before. Back in 1985, when global prices were relatively high and America's domestic oil industry was on the upswing, US crude oil imports fell to 3.2m barrels per day, their <a href=\"http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/dnav/pet/hist/mcrimus2a.htm\">lowest level since the early 1970s</a>. By 1993, with prices at about 50% of their 1985 levels, crude imports had more than doubled, to nearly 6.8m barrels per day. Furthermore, Opec's share of those crude imports <a href=\"http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/dnav/pet/hist/mcrimxx2a.htm\">rose from 41% in 1985 to 54% in 1993</a>. (In 2007, <a href=\"http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/dnav/pet/pet_move_impcus_a2_nus_epc0_im0_mbblpd_a.htm\">Opec's share of the US crude import market</a> was 53.7%.)</p> <p>If we experience a prolonged stint of low crude prices, the US oil industry will, once again, fall on hard times. That will likely mean that foreign producers, who generally have lower production costs, will increase their share of the US oil market, and they will do so at the expense of domestic producers. </p> <p>Furthermore, low prices will exacerbate Mexico's already perilous economic situation and may increase the flow of Mexican immigrants northward. Given America's renewed focus on immigration issues, this issue gets scant attention. But the facts are clear. Mexico has long depended on oil revenues to fund its government. In 2006, the Mexican government got 37% of its revenues from cash generated by the state-owned oil company, Pemex. A sustained period of low prices would devastate Pemex, an inefficient company that has struggled to keep production up at its largest and most important oil field, Cantarell. That field is the world's second-largest oilfield, (behind Saudi Arabia's Ghawar) and production from the field has been falling by about 8% per year. Without substantial oil revenues, Mexico's already weak central government will become weaker still. As conditions in Mexico deteriorate, the country will have more impoverished workers who will be inclined to migrate northward in search of better opportunities. </p> <p>Finally, cheap oil undermines the US ethanol industry. Regardless of your opinion about the corn ethanol subsidies and mandates, cheap oil makes the economics of ethanol - made from corn or other substances - much more difficult. And with many ethanol companies declaring bankruptcy in recent months, the problems will only grow. Rumours are now surfacing that the ethanol sector may seek a bail-out from Congress. If low oil prices persist, the potential for a bail-out becomes more probable. </p> <p>The punch line here is obvious: Cheap oil may be good for the short term, but the longer-term consequences could be painful indeed.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/world/unitedstates/displayStory.cfm?story_id=12516666\">The Economist endorses Barack Obama,</a> arguing that:</p> <blockquote> <p>The Candidate McCain of the past six months has too often seemed the victim of political sorcery, his good features magically inverted, his bad ones exaggerated. The fiscal conservative who once tackled Mr Bush over his unaffordable tax cuts now proposes not just to keep the cuts, but to deepen them. The man who denounced the religious right as \"agents of intolerance\" now embraces theocratic culture warriors. The campaigner against ethanol subsidies (who had a better record on global warming than most Democrats) came out in favour of a petrol-tax holiday. It has not all disappeared: his support for free trade has never wavered. Yet rather than heading towards the centre after he won the nomination, Mr McCain moved to the right.<br></p> </blockquote> <p>All true. But what the Economists' editors don't mention and might be loath to accept is the hard fact that the old McCain for whom they pine could never in a bajillion years have won the GOP nomination. There is no way on earth to win the GOP nomination without supporting the constant deepening of tax cuts for the wealthy and without embracing theocratic cultural warriors. No way. So the McCain whom the Economist once admired is utterly incompatible with the McCain who needed to exist to win the GOP nomination. McCain himself knew this, which is why he flip-flopped on taxes and theocracy, and why he chose Palin.<br> Most conservatives who ache for the old McCain also have spent many years as enablers of the modern-day GOP becoming precisely the ideologically hidebound institution it has become. They do not have my sympathy. At least the Economist, which clearly has reservations about Obama, some of them undeniably legitimate (a thinner resume than any presidential nominee in some time), managed to reach the right conclusion here. It's a choice between two guys at the end of the day. One has acted like a guy who is ready to be the president and one hasn't.</p>",

  "<p>The multibillion dollar project to build the world's biggest wind farm in Texas has been delayed because of the fall-out from the credit crunch and the drop in the price of natural gas, it emerged today.</p> <p>T Boone Pickens, a renowned Texan oilman who is raising the capital for the wind farm, told a US television station today that the twofold problem was slowing down his ambitious plan. Pickens, who made a fortune from the oil industry but has been converted to renewable energy as a means of ending US dependence on foreign oil, announced the original plan for the wind farm <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/apr/14/windpower.energy\">last year </a>and construction was supposed to start in 2010.</p> <p>\"I think it is all going to be put off because we have got the credit crunch, one, but, two, natural gas prices [are down], so you are going to price wind off natural gas power and right now natural gas is so cheap there will be no new wind deals until natural gas price gets back up,\" he said. Natural gas prices are hovering around $6.80 per million British thermal unit (BTUs) down almost 50% since July.</p> <p>Over the same time period, Pickens's hedge fund BP Capital has lost $2bn \u2014 or 60% of its value \u2014 since peaking in June. And according to a Wall Street Journal report, investors are bailing out. </p> <p>In May this year, when oil and natural gas prices were still rising, Pickens said he had ordered $2bn worth of wind turbines from GE. At the time he estimated the total project would cost between $10-$12bn and would be finished by 2014. </p> <p>The wind farm would be built on 400,000 acres across the Texas panhandle. It was eventually have 4,000MW of capacity, which is enough to supply electricity to 1.3m homes.</p> <p>In July, the billionaire launched what he called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jul/09/energy.energy\">The Pickens Plan</a>, a $58m PR campaign aimed at convincing Americans to replace petrol with natural gas and wind. </p> <p>In today's interview on CNBC he said all lorries should be run on natural gas. If America switched 2 million \"18 wheelers\" to natural gas it would reduce the country's dependence on foreign oil by 30%, he said. He saw no reason to halt this switchover even though his wind power plans are delayed. \"It's an easy step and it can happen very, very fast.\"</p>",
  "<p>No corner of the Earth is immune from the effects of global warming, according to a new study that confirms manmade temperature rises in both the Arctic and Antarctic regions. Temperature records over the last century show that warming in the planet's coldest and most remote wildernesses is caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases. </p> <p>The study, published today in <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/ngeo/\">Nature Geoscience</a>, is the first to find the fingerprints of manmade global warming on the Antarctic, where a shortage of data makes it hard to be sure. Last year's report, from the <a href=\"http://www.ipcc.ch/\">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> (IPCC), said human influence could be detected on every continent, except Antarctica. Climate sceptics have exploited this omission to question the science of global warming.</p> <p>In the new study, Nathan Gillett, then working at the <a href=\"http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/\">Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia</a>, though now at Environment Canada, compiled, with colleagues, climate data across the Arctic and Antarctic regions since 1900, and compared the patterns with those produced by computer simulations with and without human activity. </p> <p>They say only the models that included human influences \u2013 such as emissions of carbon dioxide and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) \u2013 were able to reproduce the observed temperature trends. </p> <p>Gillett said: \"The main message is that for the first time we are able to directly attribute warming in both the Arctic and Antarctica to human influence. Melting of ice shelves has implications for sea-level rises.\" </p> <p>Peter Stott, head of climate monitoring and attribution at the <a href=\"http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/hadleycentre/\">Met Office</a>, who worked on the study, said: \"In both polar regions, the observed warming can only be reproduced in our models by including human influences, natural forces alone are not enough. </p> <p>For a long time climate scientists have known that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/28/arctic-ice-climate-change-thinning\">Arctic areas would be expected to warm</a> most strongly because of feedback mechanisms. But the results from this work demonstrate the part man has already played in the significant warming that we've observed in both polar regions.\"</p> <p>The polar regions have seen some of the most dramatic impacts of climate change on the planet in recent years. The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the global average, which has contributed to record melting of sea ice in the Arctic summer and thinning in the winter. </p> <p>The picture in Antarctica is more complex, but the rocky Antarctic peninsula has experienced temperature rises of 3C over the past 50 years \u2013 among the largest recorded.

  "<p><strong>ET TU, BENTLEY?</strong></p> <p>'Arry Redknapp called it \"character\". Jonathan Woodgate called it \"guts\". David Bentley called it \"character\". The Fiver would like to use another word that begins with \"c\" - \"corrupt\", in the moral sense; that's all we meant - in reference to the sickening orgy of backslapping that took place after Tottenham's admittedly splendid 4-4 draw at the Emirates last night. Tottenham showed guts and character all right, but barely enough to justify charging round like they'd found a cure for eyebrow dandruff rather than slipped two points further behind Rory Delap FC. \"Could it be the turning point? Yes,\" said Woodgate, taking a brief break from cultivating the first haircut that can double up as a lounge rug. \"The manager has given us a lot of confidence.\"</p> <p>Harry Redknapp is clearly an excellent manager, blessed with the capacity to make players feel extremely good about themselves (well, wouldn't you if you looked that gravity-ridden mess up and down?) but it shouldn't really come to this with players of such quality. Is there anything in football more annoying than New Manager Syndrome? (Yes. Yes there is, but as he's not on Soccer AM any more we're not sure if he counts.) It's just an excuse for minted, shamelessly indolent tools to airbrush out a past in which they moved with all the vigour of constipated corpses. Tottenham are back again, just like they were a year ago under Juande Ramos.</p> <p>Not that anyone at White Hart Lane seems to remember him. Implicitly, both through barbed comments and sharp performances since his departure, this squad of flouncing, morally bereft chancers have eased a serrated number between the shoulders of Ramos. Still, all's well that ends well, so why should they care about a thoroughly good man who's had his professional reputation perhaps fatally tarnished simply because they couldn't give one about whether they should give one. Spurs - who will be showing character in a new 60,000 stadium after announcing plans to move to Northumberland Park some time in the future - are now only eight points off seventh place and will finish easily in the top half. \"I feel like Superman,\" effaducked Bentley after last night's game. \"I could fly home.\" And there was us thinking Jamie \"Meat and two veg\" Redknapp was the man wearing the tightest suit at the Emirates last night.</p> <p>*********************</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"My criteria are: are they playing regularly?

  "<p>Barack Obama is pulling ahead in a trio of western states that four years ago were considered safe Republican territory, according to recent polls. If reflected in next week's election it will represent a sea change in American politics, and a vindication of the Democrats strategy since sweeping the 2006 mid-term elections.</p> <p>Nevada, Colorado and New Mexico all voted for George Bush in 2000 and 2004. But the latest polling shows that Obama has opened enough of a lead for pollsters to consider the trio settled - along with its combined 19 electoral college votes.</p> <p>A Time-CNN poll released yesterday had Obama up 52-45 in Nevada. An AP-Gfk poll released the same day showed Obama with a 12-point lead in Nevada and a nine-point lead in Colorado. Rasmussen, also yesterday, gave Obama a 10-point lead in New Mexico.</p> <p>Another poll released Tuesday, by Suffolk University in Boston, put Obama 10 points ahead in Nevada. A month ago, the same organisation had the candidates tied.</p> <p>It wasn't meant to be like this. The Republican strategy was to appeal to the conservative instincts on social issues of the west's large Hispanic population. Combined with a candidate - John McCain - from a western state with a positive record on immigration reform, and the west would be secure. </p> <p>But this year has not followed the script. Hispanics, Republicans have discovered, are motivated by the same issues as the rest of the country: the economy, healthcare, education. And as he has sought to reassure the party's base, so McCain has retreated from his earlier bipartisan approach to immigration reform.</p> <p>\"The west has the opportunity to offer Democrats long-term growth in a way that the south did to the Republicans in the 1960s,\" said Jill Hanauer, president of Project New West, set up by the Democratic leadership in 2007.</p> <p>Both candidates spent last weekend in western states before returning to the sites of the decisive battles of the last two elections.</p> <p>\"Even if everything falls flat for Obama, and McCain gets Florida and North Carolina, there's still this firewall in the west,\" said David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk's Political Research Center. \"That should do it for him.\"</p> <p>Even beyond the three core western swing states there are signs that the wider west is turning Democrat. From Montana, where the candidates are within four points of each other, via North Dakota to McCain's home state of Arizona, where he has a narrowing margin of five points, the region is becoming hostile territory for the Republicans.</p> <p>\"This is a fiercely independent part of the country,\" said Hanauer. \"People adopt western aspirations of independence and individualism when they come here. This is the only region where 90% of voters say their state offers a unique quality of life. John McCain keeps campaigning as a westerner but in terms of quality of life and other issues that are important to westerners, he's stuck his foot in his mouth.\"</p> <p>Quality of life translates into more concrete concerns at election time. The west is the fastest growing region in the country, and as such voters are concerned about how to manage that growth. Immigration, water rights, the environment, infrastructure and education are all common concerns for voters in the west. </p> <p>\"Republicans need to start rethinking the west, their attitudes and how they talk to people,\" said David Parker, a political scientist at the University of Montana. \"It's not enough just to say keep government out of my life. This could even reshape the debate on the environment. Many conservatives here are pro-environment: they want to conserve it.\"</p> <p>Montana has one unique factor lacking in the other western states: Ron Paul. The libertarian Republican is on the ballot in the state, to some extent against his own wishes. His approach appeals to the strong libertarian bent in the state, and particularly since the economic crisis struck, he has been drawing support from John McCain. </p> <p>\"If we see Ron Paul polling around 8% that could do something which I would never normally expect - flip the state for Barack Obama,\" said Parker: \"</p> <p>Yet while McCain supporters may go for Paul in Montana, Bush supporters in Nevada are breaking for Obama. One fifth of self-described Bush voters in 2004 say they will vote for Obama this time, according to the Suffolk poll. The reason, said Paleologos, is the economic downturn.</p> <p>\"Barack Obama is winning most of the demographic groups,\" he said, noting that Obama is ahead among men and women, independents, young voters and older voters. \"The movement is driven by the collapse in the economy. Voters, even older white men, are looking at their 401ks [retirement plans] and connecting the dots: Republicans, George W Bush, John McCain, deregulation.\"</p> <p>And as elsewhere, Obama has the ground campaign, outspending and out-muscling McCain.</p> <p>\"My own door has been knocked on four times by Democratic canvassers and not at all by the Republicans,\" said the University of Montana's Parker. \"This is weird. I've never seen anything like this before.\"</p>",
  "<p>It's a sure sign that times are tough when Barclays Capital feels obliged to cancel its Christmas shindigs. </p> <p>The bank, which has just taken over much of Lehman Brothers, doesn't want to do anything that \"might be seen as inappropriate\" in the global financial crisis, according to an internal message circulated by its chief operating officer, Rich Ricci (surely the perfect name for a banker). </p> <p>The memo was leaked to the US website <a href=\"http://dealbreaker.com/2008/10/barclehs-cancels-christmas.php\">Dealbreaker</a>.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/vw-volkswagen\">Volkswagen</a>, Europe's biggest carmaker, today defied recessionary gloom by reasserting it would beat last year's record for sales and profits in 2008.</p> <p>In a remarkably upbeat view, VW announced a 15% jump in operating earnings in the first nine months of this year to \u20ac4.9bn (\u00a33.87bn). Net earnings leapt 28.5% to \u20ac3.7bn.</p> <p>But the world's third-largest auto manufacturer behind Toyota and General Motors indicated that earnings had been squeezed in the third quarter, the current quarter was proving difficult and 2009 would be \"very tough\".</p> <p>The group is at the centre of a storm over volatile trading in its shares after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/29/vw-volkswagen-short-selling\">Porsche, which wants to take it over, said it had amassed a controlling stake of 74.1%</a> and aimed for a \"domination agreement\" or 75% holding next year.</p> <p>Hans Dieter P\u00f6tsch, VW's chief financial officer, threw a spanner in Porsche's works, however, by suggesting that its plans could be derailed by a prolonged court battle.</p> <p>The European commission is poised to take Germany back to the European Court of Justice over its refusal to remove a 20% blocking minority vote enjoyed by the federal state of Lower Saxony under the 1960 \"VW Law\". </p> <p>The ECJ banned this law just over a year ago but Berlin's revised version retains this effective veto on key decisions for the state.</p> <p>P\u00f6tsch refused to comment on VW's stance, saying this was an issue for its supervisory board, but said VW itself had played no role in the recent frenzied trading, selling none of its \"put\" options.</p> <p>Today's figures sent VW's stock up 13% in late-afternoon trading to \u20ac585, compared with a all-time high of \u20ac1,005 on Tuesday and a close of \u20ac517 yesterday.</p> <p>VW is now valued at around \u20ac174bn, more than all its European peers combined, which have begun <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/automotive\">announcing temporary shutdowns of plants and lay-offs to cope with depressed sales and earnings</a>. P\u00f6tsch said VW could prolong Christmas/New year holidays by a few days to cope with slackening demand.</p> <p>He said turnover rose by 5.5% in the period to \u20ac85.4bn, with deliveries up 4% to 4.8m worldwide \u2013 raising VW's global market share to 10.1% from 9.6%. The group hopes to further increase its share in a worldwide market which is set to decline in 2009.</p> <p>P\u00f6tsch said: \"We are confirming our forecast for 2008 despite the dramatic deterioration in global economic conditions and the automotive industry environment in recent months.\" He added: \"We are confident we will be able to beat the total market performance as we have done this year.\"</p> <p>German truck- and bus-maker MAN, meanwhile, reported operating earnings up a third at \u20ac422m.</p>",
  "<p>The difference between before and after New Labour is that time has been wasted and the world is nearer the brink of environmental disaster. Either we reduce carbon emissions by 90% over the next 40 years, or we face the consequences of runaway <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climatechange\">climate change</a> and the conflict and disruption caused by growing scarcities of oil and other resources.</p> <p>Consumerism is the biggest obstacle to sustainability and the pressure to consume is stoked by greater inequality. Inequality amplifies social status differences and adds to status insecurity and competition. People in more unequal societies struggle to keep up: they work longer hours, borrow more and save less. </p> <p>Fairness is also key to policies to reduce global warming. Allowing rich nations or individuals to produce 10 times the carbon emissions of the poor is not a basis for agreement and effective enforcement.</p> <p>Even if we have to accept lower living standards to reach the target for reducing carbon emissions, that need not reduce the real quality of life. Health, happiness and measures of wellbeing in the rich world have long been decoupled from economic growth. What matters is no longer whether the whole society is a bit richer or poorer, but how big the material differences between us are. Wellbeing and the quality of life in modern societies is now better served by reducing inequality rather than by promoting growth. Data shows that more unequal societies suffer worse health, more violence, worse mental health, more drug problems. They have higher obesity and teenage birth rates and they imprison more people. Inequality is also socially divisive: greater inequality goes with lower levels of trust and weaker community life. </p> <p>If this is the picture presented by the data for rich, stable, market democracies, before the financial crisis, how much more might be at stake if societies suffered bigger shocks? Where inequality and insecurity are almost entirely unrestrained the consequences can be appalling for everyone. In Russia, with its oligarchs and poverty, average male life expectancy is 18 years fewer than in Britain, and female life expectancy 9 years fewer. Compare that with Cuba where resources, though no more plentiful, are much more equally shared. Life expectancy is almost as good as in the USA and only a year or two below that in the UK.</p> <p>We face a choice between coordinated change initiated and planned by ourselves, or the conflict and suffering resulting from failure. Rich individuals and nations may think money or military force will keep them out of trouble. But that is a false hope. The data shows that the health and social consequences of inequality envelop whole societies.</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.wwf.org.uk/\">WWF</a>, Cuba is the only country that has managed to combine an environmentally sustainable footprint per head of population with an acceptably high quality of life as measured by the <a href=\"http://hdr.undp.org/en/\">UN Human Development Index</a>. And if Cuba can do that without the latest and most economical technology, how much easier should it be for us?</p> <p>Material inequality is a powerful determinant of the quality of social relations, of public spiritedness and of the psychosocial wellbeing of modern populations. Blaming our broken society on the poor and the broken economy on the rich must not obscure the need to reduce inequality or the fact that more equal societies perform measurably better on environmental goals.</p> <p><em>\"After New Labour\", the second debate in the \"Who owns the progressive future?\" series, organised by Comment is free and <a href=\"http://www.soundings.org.uk/\">Soundings journal</a>, will take place in London at <a href=\"http://www.kingsplace.co.uk/\">Kings Place</a> on November 3 at 7pm.

  "<p>Labour today launched an all-out assault on George Osborne, the shadow chancellor, by releasing a <a href=\"http://image.theguardian.com/sys-files/Politics/documents/2008/10/30/Osbornedossier.pdf\">dossier that accused him of a lack of judgment (pdf) </a> on the global financial crisis and \"schoolboy errors\" in his spending plans. </p> <p>The document highlighted Osborne's early opposition to the nationalisation of Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley, his support for a Tory report advocating the deregulation of the mortgage market, and his pledges on fuel duty and hospital beds. </p> <p>The Conservatives hit back, accusing Labour of an attempt to distract attention from its own failings.</p> <p>Labour is seeking to pile pressure on the shadow chancellor, who has come under intense pressure over his meetings with Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. His poll rating has also slipped, with Osborne trailing behind Alistair Darling, the chancellor, on who is most trusted to handle the economy.</p> <p>The Labour party claimed Tory plans for 45,000 new single rooms in NHS hospitals were based on \"back of the envelope\" calculations that put the bill at \u00a31.57bn, when Department of Health estimates - released this week in response to a Conservative parliamentary question - calculated it at more than \u00a39.5bn. </p> <p>Stephen Timms, the financial secretary to the Treasury, said that the Tory figure was extrapolated from the bill for 81 recent single-room conversions, which were more \"straightforward and cost-effective\" than would be the case in most NHS hospitals. </p> <p>The \u00a38bn discrepancy gave the lie to Osborne's claim that Tory plans were \"fully costed\", said Timms. </p> <p>Echoing Gordon Brown's speech to the Labour party conference, the dossier said: \"George Osborne's schoolboy errors and lack of judgment show why this is no time for a novice.\" </p> <p>Timms said: \"Whenever George Osborne has faced a tough test, his judgment has been shown to be wrong. He has shown a willingness to create headlines on the hoof without care for the consequences. </p> <p>\"Nowhere is this clearer than in his pledge on single rooms, which won good headlines but would require an extra \u00a38bn in health service funding for which George Osborne has failed to budget. </p> <p>\"Labour is steadily increasing the proportion of single rooms in the NHS, but we have to do this on an affordable and responsible basis.\"</p> <p>The Conservatives dismissed the claims, saying: \"This is just an attempt to draw away from the fact that the economy is in a shockingly weak state and the government is without a clue on how to remedy matters. Labour will leave this country with the biggest overdraft in history and they do not know how to undo the damage so they are spending their time drawing up daft dossiers instead.\"</p> <p>The Department of Health was asked for calculations on the cost of building 45,000 single NHS rooms by Mark Hoban, a member of the Conservatives' shadow Treasury team. </p> <p>The Conservatives estimated the cost of building the rooms would be \u00a335,000 a bed, equivalent to \u00a31.57bn in total.</p> <p>But a written answer from Ann Keen, the junior health minister, published on Tuesday, said DoH officials estimated that the cost would be \u00a3211,401 per bed, equivalent to \u00a39.51bn.</p> <p>Keen said in her answer: \"NHS organisations make decisions locally based on practical considerations such as site restrictions, affordability, as well as clinical and operational limitations. Any national estimate must therefore make assumptions regarding the methods likely to be used for providing more single rooms and the likely cost effects of such methods.\"</p> <p>The Conservatives insisted today they were \"absolutely confident\" of their original calculations.</p> <p>Andrew Lansley, the Tory health spokesman, announced last month that by the end of a first Tory term in office single NHS rooms would be available for all expectant mothers, mental health patients and anyone undergoing an operation.</p> <p>A Tory spokesman said: \"To achieve our goal of offering any NHS patient who wants one a single room we need to dramatically increase the number of single rooms within the NHS. The vast majority of the cost of doing this will be provided by converting existing wards. The cost of this is massively less expensive than the government is now claiming. And so we are absolutely confident of our original costings.\"</p> <p>Labour's wide-ranging dossier on Osborne also points out that the Conservatives' proposed fuel duty escalator, unveiled with great fanfare in July, would mean motorists paying 5p a litre more in tax on petrol now.</p> <p>This is because the escalator is based on the principle that tax falls as the cost of fuel goes up and rises when it comes down, it would have saved drivers 5p a litre when pump prices were \u00a31.18 in the summer, but cost them a similar amount in extra tax now that they have dropped to 98p, said Labour. </p> <p>In a further attempt to embarrass the Conservatives, the dossier highlighted a comment made by Osborne in the House of Commons in February in which he stated he was \"not in favour of nationalisation, full stop\" for Northern Rock. </p> <p>Labour claims the shadow chancellor's opposition to provisions in the banking bill would have stood in the way of the government taking the ailing bank and part of Bradford &amp; Bingley into public ownership. </p> <p>The dossier also drew on the fact that Osborne welcomed last year's Conservative economic competitiveness policy group report, which advocated deregulation of the mortgage market, hailing it in his conference speech in October 2007 as the first signs of global economic turmoil were emerging. </p> <p>It also quotes the shadow chancellor's description of the short-selling that was blamed for heightening the difficulties faced by banks like Bradford &amp; Bingley as \"a function of capitalist markets\".</p>",
  "<p>At church on Sundays, Juliana Tocay fibs and introduces 3-year-old Katerin as her daughter. The truth is too complicated to explain.</p> <p>Tocay is Katerin's foster mother, making her family part of a much-watched test of whether Guatemala can take care of its own needy children.</p> <p>After essentially closing off the pipeline that sent nearly 5,000 children for adoptions in the US last year, Guatemala has launched an ambitious campaign to recruit foster parents and even adoptive parents at home.</p> <p>Only a few dozen families are participating and, as Tocay's experience illustrates, it will be a tall order to change the culture of a country that typically views only biological children as true members of the family.</p> <p>From the United Nations to potential adoptive parents in the US, Guatemala's experiment is getting scrutiny because many of the children who can't find temporary or permanent families will end up in deficient institutions.</p> <p>\"Our friends might not understand, but God gave us something so we could give her something,\" said Tocay, who lives in a tidy subdivision outside Guatemala City with her husband and three children. \"And He gives us strength to be strong for her.\"</p> <p>For years, children like Katerin, who was abandoned by her mother in Guatemala's rural highlands, would have found their new homes in America. Last year, Guatemala sent more children to the US than any other nation except China.</p> <p>But nearly everyone agreed that the system was vulnerable to abuse, especially by shadowy middlemen who sometimes paid birth mothers to give up their children.</p> <p>Amid global pressure, Guatemala passed a law in December that made adoptions part of a government system, taking it out of the hands of lawyers and other private actors.</p> <p>But as it works to create its new system, Guatemala's new national adoption council said in September that it will not accept any new cases. Likewise, the US state department has stopped processing new adoptions from that country.</p> <p>US groups that advocate for international adoption have criticised the new law, saying it is creating barriers that keep children away from loving parents. And they have expressed doubts that Guatemala has the resources to properly care for those children.</p> <p>Nearly 60% of Guatemalans live in poverty, meaning many families cannot afford another child, although foster parents do receive a stipend. And authorities are bypassing the richest families because children would find it tough to leave luxury to return to their biological families.</p> <p>Only about 45 families in a nation of 13 million currently have taken in foster children since the program began this year.</p> <p>\"Guatemalans have good intentions, but maybe they don't know how to channel that assistance,\" said Vilma Masaya, who had oversight of the program as deputy secretary for the department of social welfare. \"For us, it is about changing the culture.\"</p> <p>Masaya said the recruiting effort is critical because countless children might be shifted from the adoption track into government care if an ongoing investigation detects irregularities in how they were placed for adoption.</p> <p>Authorities have felt compelled to loosen the requirements for foster parents by allowing single mothers to participate and by raising the maximum age from 55 to 65.</p> <p>There are signs of progress. By creating satellite offices in far-flung regions, the department of social welfare has already doubled its pool of interested families.</p> <p>Advocates also are finding success by taking their recruiting pitch directly to the pulpit of evangelical churches that have spread throughout Guatemala. About 90% of their families have been recruited from church events, authorities said.</p> <p>One of those foster mothers, Claudia Lopez, frequently references her spirituality when discussing why she and her husband, Marco, took in a baby girl named Sandra.</p> <p>Their own daughter died in an auto accident. And when Marco, a fireman, came across a mother who had killed her daughter while committing suicide, they took it as a sign from God that they needed to open their home</p> <p>Now their Guatemala City home is filled with the giggles of a girl who recently celebrated her first birthday with clowns and pi\u00f1atas.</p> <p>But Lopez does not hide her sadness in knowing that Sandra will someday return to her biological family. The government sends social workers for routine visits that help ease the introductions, and eventual farewells, between foster parents and children.</p> <p>\"We love her as if she were our own. She is so sweet, she makes you love her,\" Lopez said. \"At night, I think about saying goodbye. But then I think that somewhere, maybe her mother is crying, too, and that they should be together.\"</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/deutschebank\">Deutsche Bank</a> today reported steep falls in pre-tax and net profits and a further series of writedowns in the third quarter as the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers last month sent the global banking sector into freefall.</p> <p>It warned of further trading losses in the current quarter on top of the \u20ac1.3bn (\u00a31bn) recorded in the third quarter despite some early signs of loosening in credit markets following co-ordinated government intervention. It dropped a big hint it would cut this year's dividend but insisted it had no need to raise capital from the state.</p> <p>Germany's biggest bank said it made just \u20ac93m pre-tax and \u20ac414m net but it would have swung to a substantial loss if it had not used revised accounting rules allowing it to reclassify some toxic assets and booked gains from tax refunds and asset sales.</p> <p>The financial services company Standard &amp; Poor's said pre-tax losses would have been about \u20ac1bn compared with the \u20ac1.4bn it earned a year ago and said the bank's outlook was negative because the investment bank industry remains under heavy pressure and \"markets further deteriorated in October\".</p> <p>Even so, the bank's shares rose as much as 20% during the day before settling back with a 16% increase in late-afternoon trading.</p> <p>Deutsche is the first major European bank to take advantage of EU decisions to follow the lead of the US and enable banks to avoid having to place a current market price on certain unsaleable assets - \"mark to market\" valuations.</p> <p>Its writedowns at its investment bank totalled \u20ac1.2bn compared with \u20ac2.2bn a year ago when the sub-prime crisis erupted, but these would have been closer to third-quarter 2007 levels without the accounting changes.</p> <p>The investment bank reported net revenues of \u20ac1.7bn, a fall of 11% as its equities trading desk was hit by worsening market conditions and heavy losses. It recorded a \u20ac790m loss.</p> <p>Overall, Deutsche made \u20ac414m net in the quarter compared with \u20ac1.6bn a year ago when the bank appeared to be riding out the sub-prime storm. The new accounting rules swelled net earnings by \u20ac536m.</p> <p>But the bank said it had substantially reduced its risk exposure and had raised its Tier 1 capital ratio to 10.3% \u2013 a ratio inflated by a \u20ac2.2bn capital increase ahead of the agreed purchase of a 29.75% stake in Deutsche Postbank, one of Germany's biggest retail banks.</p> <p>Josef Ackermann, the chief executive, said that, despite September's extraordinary conditions, the bank had made a profit. \"After a period of exceptional market turbulence, the outlook for our business remains challenging. Conditions in the equity and credit markets remain extremely difficult,\" he said.</p> <p>Stefan Krause, the chief financial officer, indicated that Deutsche had accrued a dividend of \u20ac2.25 in the first half and zero in the third quarter. While insisting that dividend policy would be set in January next year, he admitted that the prospect of a \u20ac4.50 pay-out was \"unrealistic.\"</p> <p>Maintaining that the bank had reduced its risk exposure to \u20ac12bn under the new rules and had carried out significant deleveraging, Krause said: \"We are in no need for further capital right now.\" But he left open the question of whether or not the bank would access the state guarantee scheme for new lending.</p>",
  "<p>So what exactly does change look like? Barack Obama has ambitious energy and environmental plans. If he wins on November 4, who will he recruit to carry them out? Will he rely more heavily on Washington newcomers or on Clinton administration veterans who know their way around the White House? (See who John McCain might choose to green his White House <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/environment/2008/oct/29/network-mccain-cabinet\">here</a>)</p> <p>Obama's choice for a transition team leader \u2014 John Podesta, former Clinton chief of staff \u2014 suggests he's willing to look back to the Clinton years for top staff. But Obama has also surrounded himself with bright and accomplished advisers (note our interviews with energy policy chief Jason Grumet and director Heather Zichal) who are newer to the national scene. Will he fill Cabinet-level environmental jobs with fresh faces or stick to a more traditional path with ex-governors and Washington lawmakers? We asked campaign advisors, nonprofit conservation advocates, think-tank types, lobbyists, academics, and friendly looking folks behind us in line at the co-op. It's a cardinal sin in Washington to openly speculate on these matters before an election, so we promised confidentiality to many sources.</p> <h2>Secretary of Energy</h2> <p>Managing the nation's energy policy and nuclear safety is one of the most glamourless, thankless Cabinet-level positions, according to former Department of Energy officials. The secretary oversees the nation's nuclear weapons stockpile and nuclear waste disposal and a lot of private contracts. \"You get a whole lot of responsibility for regulating, but you don't get a lot of credit for achieving good things in the political process,\" said Walter Rosenbaum, a former DOE consultant and energy policy scholar. Still, the position could take on more prominence in the next administration, given the amount of attention the candidates devoted to energy during the campaign.</p> <p><strong>Jason Grumet</strong><br>The Obama campaign's lead energy and environment advisor first started working with the senator when he arrived in Washington in 2005. In helping Obama develop his energy platform, Jason Grumet drew from his experience as head of the National Commission on Energy Policy and the Bipartisan Policy Center. Grumet's think-tank work has focused on building consensus among diverse interests, though the NCEP's 2004 energy report annoyed many environmentalists by calling for pollution permits to be given free of charge to polluters and by supporting a \"safety valve\" that would limit the price of pollution credits. This job has traditionally gone to seasoned governors and lawmakers, but Obama has shown affinity for policy wonks like Grumet. (Read a Grist interview with Grumet.)</p> <p><strong>Ed Rendell</strong><br>With energy issues in the national spotlight, a veteran politician with deal-brokering experience could be at a premium. The Pennsylvania governor has worked to curb mercury emissions from the state's coal-fired power plants, adopted California's tough clean-car regulations, and pushed tax credits and other measures to attract renewable energy companies. Ed Rendell was one of Hillary Clinton's key supporters during the Democratic primary, but has since campaigned for Obama. If he delivers his swing state next month, this spot (or another in Obama's Cabinet) could be his for the taking.</p> <p><strong>Dan Reicher</strong><br>Dan Reicher [PDF] has recently talked up geothermal energy as the potential \"killer app\" of the energy world. He gets his techie metaphors at Google.org, the philanthropic arm of the search engine giant, where he is director of climate change and energy initiatives. Before that he worked as an assistant energy secretary under President Clinton, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, and a sales executive at a renewable energy firm. Reicher's knowledge of venture capital and commercializing green technology make him an appealing candidate to Bill Becker, executive director of the Presidential Climate Action Project. \"We're facing one of the most promising worldwide market opportunities that we've ever had, and we need this kind savvy business experience,\" Becker said. (Watch a Grist interview with Reicher.)</p> <h2>Environmental Protection Agency administrator</h2> <p>This position is traditionally given Cabinet rank, meaning the EPA administrator gets to sit at a long oval table in the West Wing. The EPA enforces (or is supposed to enforce) the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the rest of the nation's environmental laws. The next EPA administrator could also be charged with implementing a new cap-and-trade carbon emissions program, which both candidates call for (in different versions). \"That would be one of the most complicated acts ever to pass Congress,\" said Barry Rabe, a University of Michigan environmental policy and climate change scholar. \"It would call for a level of cooperation across government agencies like [the formation of] Homeland Security. And we know how difficult that has been.\"</p> <p><strong>Mary Nichols</strong><br>As one of the key leaders working to implement California's groundbreaking and ambitious 2006 climate law, Mary Nichols has eye-catching qualifications for this job. She's been chair of the California Air Resources Board since July 2007, reprising a role she held from 1978 to 1983 under Gov. Jerry Brown. In the early 1970s, she worked as an environmental lawyer, spending time at the Natural Resources Defense Council, then later going on to serve as secretary for California's Resources Agency and a senior official in the Clinton EPA. Her extraordinarily deep resume would be hard to match if government experience factors heavily in Obama's decision.</p> <p><strong>Kathleen McGinty</strong><br>Pennsylvania's top environmental official worked alongside Gov. Rendell in attracting green businesses and regulating coal and manufacturers -- no small task in the rust-belt state. As head of the state's Department of Environmental Protection, Kathleen McGinty battled with Republicans and coal industry officials and succeeded in establishing tough clean-air standards. She was a long-time Al Gore aide who first worked on his Senate staff in 1988. She chaired President Clinton's Council on Environmental Quality, the first (and only) woman to hold that position. She isn't part of Obama's inner circle of advisors, but choosing her could signal to environmentalists that he takes their concerns seriously. (Read a Grist interview with McGinty.)</p> <p><strong>Dan Esty</strong><br>A top energy advisor for the Obama campaign, Dan Esty would bring both EPA experience and academic policy chops. He served in George H.W. Bush's EPA, helping to craft the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act and the environmental provisions of NAFTA. He's now an environmental law professor at Yale, where he's written recently on sustainable business. In April he helped bring a group of governors to Yale to plot ways to fight climate change. \"With his closeness to the Obama campaign and his record with the EPA, I think he would be one of the top contenders,\" said University of Florida political scientist Walter Rosenbaum. \"He has a reputation as a moderate. But if you want someone who could rally the environmental troops, he could do that.\"</p> <h2>Secretary of agriculture</h2> <p>The secretary of agriculture oversees food and farm policy, and is charged with everything from securing food safety to promoting agricultural trade to fighting hunger. The USDA inspects and grades meats and grains, administers crop and ethanol subsidies, hands out food stamps and disaster relief, runs land conservation programs, and oversees organic labeling. The U.S. Forest Service, with its 190 million acres of forest and grassland, is also under the department's purview. Sustainable-food guru Michael Pollan recently argued that our fossil fuel-dependent food system can't go much longer without a locavorous overhaul. An innovative thinker in this position would help.</p> <p><strong>Tom Vilsack</strong><br>The former Iowa governor and presidential candidate fits the classic mold for secretary of agriculture: a popular leader from a farm state (though he grew up in Pittsburgh). Vilsack supported Hillary Clinton in the Iowa primary, and if she had won the nomination, he'd be ordering Secretary of Ag business cards right now. His decidedly moderate record on farm policy may not appeal to Obama, but, like the Democratic candidate, Vilsack strongly supports corn ethanol, at least as a bridge to cellulosic ethanol. He instituted some new regulations on Iowa's industrial hog farms, though watchdogs say he should've done much more. And he understands that sustainable rural development means more than just commodity farming. His recent op-ed in the Argus Leader (S.D.), hometown paper to Obama confidante Tom Daschle, could be interpreted as a letter of interest for the job. (Read a Grist interview with Vilsack.)</p> <p><strong>Tom Buis</strong><br>Tom Buis is president of the National Farmer's Union, the more progressive, small-farm-friendly of the two largest farm advocacy groups (the other is the Farm Bureau). He was senior agricultural policy advisor to Daschle, the Obama buddy and former Senate majority leader. And he was a Hoosier grain and livestock farmer with his brothers Mike and Jeff, who still run the family farm. Buis disappointed conservationists, hunger-relief advocates, and fruit-and-vegetable growers by endorsing last year's \"sham reform\" farm bill. Buis would be a don't-rock-the-boat (or the tractor?) choice on crop subsidies and food policy. Michael Pollan would not be happy. </p> <p><strong>Stephanie Herseth Sandlin</strong><br>South Dakota's sole representative in the U.S. House has made a name for herself as a prairie populist along the lines of Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer (D). Stephanie Herseth Sandlin directed the South Dakota Farmers Union Foundation before getting elected to the House, where she's a member of the Blue Dog Coalition of fiscally conservative Democrats. She sits on the House Agriculture Committee, a position that's allowed her send bountiful shares of federal crop subsidies back to her home state. If Obama wants substantial farm-policy reform, the House Ag Committee might be the last place to look. If he wants a charismatic leader who's pledged to put rural concerns before left-right ideology, Herseth Sandlin could be a possibility.</p> <h2>Secretary of the interior</h2> <p>The Department of the Interior manages 500 million acres, about 20 percent of all U.S. land, and also wields significant control over energy reserves, dealing with coal and mineral deposits on public land, offshore oil, and many hydroelectric dams. National parks, national wildlife refuges, the Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs also fall under the department's umbrella. Fifteen of the last 16 interior secretaries have come from Western states, where most public land lies. Break that tradition at your own peril, Mr. President-elect.</p> <p><strong>Brian Schweitzer</strong><br>The bolo-tied governor of Montana is mentioned as a Rising Star of the Democratic Party often enough to have it engraved on his belt buckle. He advocates a use-'em-all approach to energy sources, including \"clean coal,\" liquefied coal, and Montana oil as well as renewable sources. A rancher who chose a Republican as a running mate for lieutenant governor, Brian Schweitzer has a knack for talking about natural resources and land-use issues in down-to-earth language. \"He can speak to the West,\" said Bill Becker. \"He's shown a talent for bridging the gap between the new West and the old West. What that means in energy terms is bridging the gap between fossil energy and renewable energy.\"</p> <p><strong>Jamie Rappaport Clark</strong><br>Bill Clinton's former Fish and Wildlife Service director managed Endangered Species Act protections and oversaw a massive expansion of the National Wildlife Refuge System. After 20 years in government, Jamie Rappaport Clark landed at Defenders of Wildlife, where she, well, defends wildlife. She has testified in Congress against Bush's Interior Department, calling it to task for manipulating science to undermine the ESA. \"There are few [people] if anybody who knows more about these issues than Jamie does,\" said Leda Clark, executive director of Endangered Species Coalition. \"She has a very practical sense of the problems and potential fixes in the department.\" One issue: She was a military child who grew up in part in California and Okinawa, along with North Carolina and Georgia. It's tough to argue that makes her a Westerner, though a Changer-in-Chief might be willing to buck that tradition. (Read a Grist Q&amp;A with Rappaport Clark.)</p> <p><strong>Jay Inslee</strong><br>The suburban Seattle congressman has earned the favor of conservationists through his leadership in protecting open spaces and wildlife. He sought to preserve roadless areas against Bush administration encroachment and has been one of the House's steadiest voices opposing logging on public lands. Jay Inslee has a lower political profile than Schweitzer and the other Western governors who could be offered this job. He wouldn't be a popular choice with Republicans, so Obama would have to think carefully about burning the political capital required to get Inslee's nomination confirmed. But his work on renewable energy, including his book Apollo's Fire: Igniting America's Clean Energy Economy, jives with Obama's focus. </p> <h2>Bonus position: climate change czar</h2> <p>By creating a prominent new position and staff, \u00e0 la Homeland Security, the next president could send a clear message that he plans to take global warming seriously. Whether such a move would be smart governing is another matter. Creating new job titles and shuffling around departments willy-nilly is no guarantee of getting anything accomplished, of course. Rather than presiding over a significant restructuring of departments, a \"climate change czar\" could function more as a special environmental adviser to the president. Then again, the chair of the Council on Environmental Quality is already charged with that job. (Look for a trusted advisor and policy wonk like Chicagoan Howard Learner to fill that role for Obama.) Still, after a year of squabbling over flag pins, both candidates ought to know that symbolism matters, and the symbolic weight of a new position might be worth the effort.</p> <p><strong>Bill Richardson</strong><br>Saving the planet might be the next logical challenge for a guy who's already been a U.S. representative, ambassador to the U.N., energy secretary, governor of New Mexico, and international peace negotiator in North Korea and Darfur. As governor, Bill Richardson signed an aggressive energy package that, among other things, required all investor-owned electrical utilities to generate 10 percent of their energy from renewable sources by 2011. As a presidential candidate, he unveiled an ambitious energy plan that included a carbon cap-and-trade system to cut greenhouse-gas emissions 90 percent by 2050 and a pledge to cut U.S. oil demand by 50 percent by 2020. He promised to be the first true \"energy president\" before dropping out of the Democratic primary and endorsing Obama. If he's ready to leave the governor's mansion in Santa Fe, this position could be an appealing fit. </p> <p><strong>Terry Tamminen</strong><br>As a top advisor to California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R), Terry Tamminen helped engineer California's ambitious 2006 carbon cap-and-trade plan. He then left the state in a quest to become a \"Johnny Appleseed\" of climate action, spreading plans and ideas for cutting greenhouse gases to leaders across the country, including Florida Gov. Charlie Crist (R). He gained administrative experience during a stint as head of the California EPA from 2003 to 2004, and he wrote the 2006 book Lives Per Gallon: The True Cost of Our Oil Addiction. As a Democrat who worked under a Republican governor, Tamminen would be a good fit for Obama's post-partisan philosophy. (Read a Grist interview with Tamminen, and still more about Tamminen.)</p> <p><strong>Al Gore</strong><br>As a former vice president and creator of the highly influential film An Inconv -- OK, you already know all about the guy. If Obama wants to name a climate czar, Al Gore would certainly be at the top of the short list; Obama has said as much. Gore would bring knowledge, expertise, and unparalleled star power (unless Bono took the job ...), and he could clank his Nobel Peace Prize on the table for added gravitas at cabinet meetings. But would Gore want another government job? Last year he said no. He's been much more effective (and happy) talking about the climate crisis as a private citizen than as a government official, so it would likely take an unprecedented Obama charm offensive to get Gore into any formal position. But Obama can be a charming guy ...</p> <p>\u2022 This article was shared by <a href=\"http://grist.org/\">Grist</a>, part of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/network\">Guardian Environment Network</a></p>",
  "<p>The Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) is a remarkably successful feature of the higher education system in the UK. Many academics and policy-makers profess to dislike the RAE, but the reality is that it has a high degree of credibility as a performance indicator which is taken seriously by government, funding agencies, university managements, department heads, and individual academics. The sector would benefit enormously from the development of equally credible performance measures of the rest of our activities. </p> <p>Instead, the sector seems determined to destroy the credibility of the RAE. The debacle of the non-collection of submission rates in the 2008 RAE is shocking, maybe even scandalous. </p> <p>The funding councils have at least been consistent in arguing that, for them, the RAE is just a tool for determining a funding stream, and they have no interest in the research performance of those academics whom universities choose not to submit for assessment. This is an argument that resonates with the famous Tom Lehrer song: \"Once the rockets are up, who cares where they come down? That's not my department, says Wernher von Braun\". </p> <p>The RAE rockets sent up by the funding councils land in newspaper league tables, in university advertisements and websites, and in the decision-making of research councils. A responsible public agency should not ignore how its actions affect the wider system. </p> <p>The 2008 assessment includes formal judgements about the quality of the research environment in each department, and these judgements make a substantial contribution to the overall score; but the best indicator of this quality is being suppressed. The panels making the assessments received statistics about research student numbers, research grants and other metrics, but were denied any information about the number of faculty not submitted for assessment. Does anyone really believe that a department in which half the faculty have, in six years, not produced research output worthy of assessment is as good a research environment as a department in which everyone is research-active? </p> <p>As early as 2003, the 1994 Group of universities put the case to the English funding council, Hefce, for the collection and publication of submission rates. We also argued that whatever decision was made, the rules needed to be clear before institutions made their RAE submission. So far from there being clarity, there has been a fog of regulatory uncertainty; and a major change in the rules of the game a few weeks before publication of the RAE results is only the latest, if worst, example. </p> <p>No arguments against collection and publication of submission rates have been offered by the funding councils or by those who have lobbied to suppress the data. There are no good arguments for suppression, only that some institutions know their claims to research excellence look more credible if public eyes can be averted from the high proportion of their academic staff not submitted to the RAE.</p> <p>How much credence would we give to school league tables if schools could choose which pupils took Sats or exclude from the GCSE statistics those pupils who didn't sit any GCSEs? Such tables would be laughed to scorn. We should give exactly the same credence to RAE tables which report average grades based on calculations from which all the zero scores have been deliberately removed. </p> <p>What is to be done? No doubt enterprising journalists will trawl the available statistics so that in December the publication of the RAE results can be supplemented by at least rough-and-ready estimates of institutional submission rates. This is not a satisfactory alternative to publication by the Higher Education statistics Agency (Hesa) of accurate statistics, but it's better than nothing. And the funding councils and Hesa should announce that the submission statistics are going to be collected. They cannot now be collected in time for publication in December, but a publication date in early 2009 is entirely feasible. </p> <p>If the funding councils really wanted to recover their credibility after this debacle, they would announce that the publication of the RAE results would be postponed for a few weeks to allow the submission statistics to be collected and published alongside the RAE grades. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Alasdair Smith was vice-chancellor of the University of Sussex from 1998 to 2007, and chair of the 1994 Group from 2001 to 2005</p>",

  "<p>The wheels seem to be coming off the Heathrow expansion, if you'll forgive the expression. The plans from the Department for Transport (DfT) for a third runway and more flights in the meantime don't even convince the environment secretary, let alone the Environment Agency. The idea \u2013 if you can call it that \u2013 that we must facilitate an inexorable growth in air travel has taken a quite a hit lately.</p> <p>Officially, the government is carrying out an <a href=\"http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/closed/heathrowconsultation/consultationdocument/\">extended consultation</a> over proposals for a new runway and a sixth terminal at Heathrow from 2020, with extra flights from around 2012 through mixed mode (allowing both runways to be used at the same time for take-off and landing). Until recently, approval for expansion has seemed a foregone conclusion, mainly because the consultation was so obviously fixed in that direction. </p> <p>But this week there have been <a href=\"http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23578849-details/Heathrow:+MPs+plot+revolt+against+third+runway/article.do\">reports</a> that the cabinet is split over the runway and the Environment Agency has continued to express its opposition. As I reported yesterday on <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/environment/2008/10/heathrow-environment-smith\">newstatesman.com</a>, Chris Smith, a former Labour minister and chairman of the agency, has criticised the government's attempt to delay new European air quality rules while increasing pollution from Heathrow. With an economic downturn and the government apparently deciding not to give aviation a free ride on carbon emissions, the prevailing wind may be blowing away from a bigger Heathrow.</p> <p>The government's case has always been that expansion will only go ahead if \"strict environmental conditions\" are met but the extent to which it has fiddled the figures, engaged in wishful thinking and moved goalposts makes its consultation the dodgiest official publication since the <a href=\"http://iraqdossier.com\">Iraq dossier</a>.</p> <p>Fortunately, unlike the dossier, we can see through the deception before the decision is taken. For example, we have seen how the DfT <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article3512042.ece\">colluded</a> with airport owner BAA to amend its modelling to give the right answers on air quality. Much of the DfT's claim that pollution following a third runway will be within legal limits depends on disputed assumptions that planes and the cars on roads nearby will by then be so much cleaner that it won't matter that there will be more of them.</p> <p>Similarly, the Dft claimed in its <a href=\"http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/closed/heathrowconsultation/consultationdocument/summary?page=2#a1006\">consultation document</a>: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"We believe that full mixed mode (540,000 ATMs) by 2015 would be compatible with compliance with the EU air quality limits for PM10, and NO2 in the vicinity of the airport without the need for further mitigation measures.\" </p> </blockquote> <p>If not an outright lie, this is tight-fisted in the extreme with the truth. The DfT was claiming here that in 2015 \u2013 the date by which mixed mode operation can be used to squeeze the maximum number of flights into two runways \u2013 pollution in the immediate area will be within the limits set out in the European Air Quality directive. Just as well, as the directive will definitely be in force by then, even if the government achieves a five-year delay. </p> <p>What the DfT was reluctant to admit was that its own predictions show that the directive will be breached at Heathrow (and elsewhere) even before any expansion and that increasing flights from around 2012 would make things worse. If you get to \"full mixed mode by 2015\" by building to it up from 2012, then that isn't \"compatible with compliance with the limits\". The government's case is that it won't breach the limits because it will <a href=\"http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23573710-details/Pollution+curbs+delayed+to+let+Heathrow+expand/article.do\">delay their implementation</a>, but that isn't the same as <em>complying</em> with them.</p> <p>And neither the <a href=\"http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/ourviews/1876673/1980740/\">Environment Agency</a> nor EU environment commissioner <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/18/pollution.carbonemissions\">Stavros Dimas</a> is convinced by the DfT's claims that breaches of the directive after 2015 will magically disappear.</p> <p>This kind of sleight of hand should make us worry that the government will fiddle the carbon figures too. In spite of dodgy claims from the <a href=\"http://kn.theiet.org/news/oct08/aircraft%20noise.cfm\">aviation industry</a> that the <em>per kilometre</em> carbon footprint of flying will soon be as low as a congestion charge-exempt car, even the government isn't claiming that more flights to and from Heathrow won't mean more carbon emissions. </p> <p>Climate change campaigners have welcomed the government's <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/3264520/Emisions-from-planes-included-for-first-time-in-climate-change-plans.html\">agreement in principle</a> to include international aviation and shipping in the legally-binding UK carbon budget. Some see it as inevitably restricting aviation expansion while others worry that limits will be sidestepped by purchasing notional carbon reductions from other countries.</p> <p>Will the economic downturn be the final nail in the coffin of Heathrow expansion? It's tempting to think so, but the government is looking further ahead. It imagines that demand for air travel will rise over 10 or 20 years and worries that Britain won't be competitive without a piece of it. But with demand <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/end-of-our-affair-with-air-travel-958707.html\">falling in the short term</a>, the sense of urgency around expanding aviation should abate. Perhaps the government won't let the aviation industry and business bounce it into an early decision. </p> <p>The government-sponsored Sustainable Development Commission has been <a href=\"http://www.sd-commission.org.uk/presslist.php/82/guide-to-contested-evidence-provides-overwhelming-case-for-review-of-air-transport-policy\">arguing</a> that decisions on expanding aviation shouldn't be rushed, while there is so much dispute over the facts, never mind the policy. It said in September that the debate looks \"immature\". Perhaps it had in mind a crass piece of triangulation from former Business Secretary <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7504975.stm\">John Hutton</a> that: \"we will help make flying greener rather than restricting people's opportunities to fly altogether\". </p> <p>If that's the strength of the case for expanding Heathrow, no wonder people are increasingly seeing through it.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/japan\">Japan</a> today announced a \u00a527tn (\u00a3166bn) stimulus package to help small businesses and provide emergency cash to families feeling the pinch from the global credit crisis.</p> <p>The measures, which include \u00a55tn in fresh spending, came amid rising expectations that the Bank of Japan will lower interest rates for the first time in seven years tomorrow as part of global efforts to ease credit flows to stricken banks.</p> <p>The announcement comes two months after parliament passed a \u00a511.7tn stimulus package to counter rising food and energy prices.</p> <p>That Japan should be raiding its war chest for the second time since August is a clear indication that, after months of skirting the worst effects of the financial crisis, the world's second-biggest economy is heading for trouble.</p> <p>\"The global financial crisis is almost certain to affect Japan's real economy,\" said the prime minister, Taro Aso, in a televised news conference. \"We understand that the most important thing is to assure the security of average households.\"</p> <p>He said the world was in the midst of a \"financial storm that comes along once every 100 years. We should not be fearful of the violent storm, but nor should we stand and let it blow us away\".</p> <p>The stimulus, equivalent to about 1.2% of Japan's annual GDP, will include \u00a52tn in benefits for households, or about \u00a560,000 for every family of four, as well as expanded loans for small businesses and tax relief on mortgages.</p> <p>The government is also poised to revive and expand a \u00a52tn fund to enable banks to lend to small businesses and to resume buying shares in struggling financial institutions, a measure first introduced at the height of the country's last banking crisis in 2002.</p> <p>Just a few weeks ago, a second round of spending hardly seemed necessary, as Japan's banks appeared to have survived the maelstrom that swallowed up their counterparts in the US.</p> <p>Since then, huge losses on the Japanese stock market have eaten into banks' capital and the surging yen is battering corporate profits. The Nikkei benchmark index has lost more than 41% this year and the yen last week rose to a 13-year high against the dollar.</p> <p>Yesterday, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/29/economy-japan-sony-toshiba-electrical\">Sony, Toshiba and Fujitsu</a> announced huge drops in operating profit for the second quarter.</p> <p>With help for exporters absent from the package, some analysts were skeptical about its impact. \"If the government wants to shore up the economy, it should have focused on easing the pain of exporters, which were the primary victims of the current financial crisis and global slowdown,\" Akio Yoshio, the chief economist at Societ\u00e9 Generale Asset Management, told Reuters.</p> <p>Aso had been expected to call an election for the end of next month but it now looks as if he will wait until next year while he focuses on the economy.</p> <p>He is certain to have been spooked by the findings of an internal Liberal Democratic party survey, reported in the Nikkei business newspaper, predicting the party would lose an election now.</p> <p>The ruling party's strength would drop from 305 to 180 seats, while the main opposition party, the Democrats, would win more than 240 seats, the survey predicted.</p> <p>But Aso said: \"The overwhelming majority of the public wants policies and economic measures, not politics. I'll decide when to dissolve parliament at the appropriate time.\"</p>",

  "<p>There we all were, at the thirsty end of the press gallery bar, glugging a few glasses (quite a few, actually) of Clive the barman's Chateau Refreshment Department.<br> There was some amusement, I can report, about the lobby's full-frontal ambush of the prime minister's new deputy press spokesman, Tom Hoskin, at No 10's afternoon briefing on Tuesday, which appears to have successfully goaded the PM to plunge, feet first, into \"Manuelgate\". Another lobby coup! Then, sadly, with timing that was rather unsporting but no doubt deliberate, the BBC suspended Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand just minutes before prime minister's questions on Wednesday and robbed us of more fun. The word in the Press Bar is that the \"Manuelgate\" story, broken by the Mail on Sunday, came about after the reporter who wrote the story, Miles Goslett, heard the offensive phone calls on BBC Radio 2 a week last Saturday and, not surprisingly, couldn't believe what he was hearing. He then, apparently, listened to the recording again, using an \"iPlayer\", or some fancy gizmo. (We didn't come into the lobby to understand fancy gizmos and new technology.) And then the Mail on Sunday were in business. Two observations, if I may. One: that'll teach the BBC to introduce these new gadgets. And, two: give that man Giles a job in the lobby. (He clearly needs to get out more. Or perhaps not, after his scoop.) But \"Manuelgate\", I can reveal, has only been a temporary diversion from another source of mirth in the lobby provided by the BBC in recent weeks \u2013 and possibly for a few weeks to come. \"He dances like a water buffalo in a tutu,\" wrote Allison Pearson in the Daily Mail this week. Hah! If you thought that was unflattering, how about Sara Wallis in the Daily Mirror? \"With a bulgy tum, thinning hair and the face of a grumpy little troll\u2026\" she wrote. Well, they could both have been writing about most middle-aged male members of the lobby, I fear. But they were referring, of course, to the lobby's own \"Sergy\", the former BBC and ITN veteran John Sergeant, who has been on the BBC's \"Strictly Come Dancing\" for the past few weeks. Such scurrilous attacks on one of the lobby's own were greeted with cries of \"Shame!\" in the Press Bar, I can tell you. Mind you, the BBC's publicity material wasn't much better. \"His award-winning career as a political journalist has been as lengthy as it has been successful and seen him interview heavyweight luminaries such as Margaret Thatcher, Tony Blair and John Major,\" the BBC gushed. Wow! A political journalist who interviewed Margaret Thatcher, Tony Blair and John Major! (Note the order the BBC places them in.) That's extraordinary! What will the BBC think of next? Well, we didn't come into the lobby to be churlish. And up in the Press Bar, we're all going to be raising our glasses to Sergy from now on. As we ordered another round of Chateau Refreshment Department (like you do), colleagues better informed than I am about Saturday evening TV confirmed that Sergy is still in with a shout in Strictly Come Dancing as it nears its heady climax. (Oh dear. That sounds like the BBC publicity material again.) \"I think even the prime minister is voting for me,\" Sergy has told the Sun modestly, before adding, \"while trying to save the global economy, of course!\" He continued: \"I imagine they're all there in the cabinet saying, 'Forget the credit crunch, should we back John's samba?'\"  Well, up to a point, John, I'm sure. However, after a few in the Press Bar and then a digestif or two in Strangers' Bar, I have hit upon a suggestion for the BBC in its \"Manuelgate\" dilemma.

  "<p></p> <p><strong>By Amanda Natividad</strong></p> <p>If you build it, they will come\u2026 but what if they don't come? That was the question <strong>Lisa Belkin</strong> (above, left), contributing writer, <strong>The New York Times</strong> <strong>Magazine</strong> and <strong>Motherlode</strong> blogger for NYT, asked at the final panel of the day at our first <strong><a href=\"http://www.contentnext.com/econwomen\">EconWomen</a></strong> <strong>conference</strong>. Starting an online community from the ground up has its difficulties, but the panelists agreed women want at least one thing - to connect. Some highlights:</p> <p>\u2022 Starting out: <strong>Brandon Holley</strong>, GM, <strong><a href=\"http://shine.yahoo.com/\">Yahoo Shine</a></strong>, pointed out what she calls the 3 Cs: content, conversation and community. Once you create good content - with personality and voice - it starts the conversation. Soon after, the community starts to grow. The reason <strong>Heather Armstrong</strong>'s blog, <strong><a href=\"http://dooce.com/\">Dooce</a></strong>, works, Holley says, is because it makes readers feel they know her. <strong>Maureen Bergmueller</strong>, director of marketing for <strong>Disney</strong> (<a href=\"http://finance.paidcontent.org/paidcontent?Page=QUOTE&amp;Ticker=DIS\">NYSE: DIS</a>) <strong>Family.com</strong>, says the site began with the primary goal of creating an environment in which women can relate to one another, establishing commonality that's rooted in content.</p> <p>\u2022 Tricks of the trade: Aside from the usual elements of a social community, Bergmueller said Disney Family.com's wiki, encouraging users to post topical photos and asking Twitter-like questions of the day helped build up the site, while Holley said Shine relied more on having strong editorial content, stressing that sometimes women just want to hear what another woman has to say. <strong>Joni Evans</strong>, CEO and co-founder, <strong>wowOwow</strong>, said polls, questions of the day and comments of the week resulted in the best feedback, and <strong>Stephanie Dolgins</strong>, SVP, Women's and Lifestyle Programming, <strong>AOL</strong> (<a href=\"http://finance.paidcontent.org/paidcontent?Page=QUOTE&amp;Ticker=TWX\">NYSE: TWX</a>), look at what works best within each demographic and seeing them responding directly to the content.</p> <p>\u2022 User comments and censorship: Once the interactivity begins, and the comments keep flowing, there comes the issue of establishing - or enforcing - conduct rules. While Armstrong (above, right) is adamant about removing inappropriate comments, she stressed that what helped her was to stop feeling guilty about deleting comments. It may be the quote of the day: \"If someone comes in and takes a crap on my living room floor, I'm not going to say, 'you have a right to do so.\" If she sees a deeply hurtful comment, she likes to \"delete, delete, delete\u2026 print it out, run over it with my car, then delete it again!\" </p> <p>Shine, on the other hand, established commenting guidelines, then when users cross them, takes down the comments. Shine and Disney Family.com have community managers who read though and remove inappropriate comments, while Dolgins said AOL allows users to report each other if need be. In general, though, all of the panelists agreed that to an extent, the users will self-regulate, as though the community becomes a social contract. Call it a need to preserve the environment, if you will, but when it comes to social media - or at least within women's social nets - the need for a safe haven, in which users can freely communicate their ideas and feelings, is clear.</p> <p><strong>From <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.org\">paidContent</a>:</strong><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.org/entry/419-new-aolcom-launches/\">'New' AOL.com homepage goes live with lifestreaming, new themes, and more</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.org/entry/419-econsports-and-econwomen-full-coverage-from-nyc/\">EconSports and EconWomen: Full coverage from NYC</a><br>\u2022 F<a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.org/entry/419-fanboys-rejoice-netflix-movie-service-coming-onto-tivo-starting-with-te/\">anboys rejoice: Netflix movie service coming onto TiVo; starting with test service</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.org/entry/419-econwomen-tina-brown-tells-cathie-black-shed-hate-to-be-in-magazine-wor/\">@ EconWomen: Tina Brown tells Cathie Black she'd 'hate to be in magazine world'</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.org/entry/419-yahoo-aol-doing-due-diligence-for-tie-up-report/\">Reports say Yahoo, AOL doing due diligence for tie-up, but sources tell us not so fast</a></p> <p><strong>From <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.co.uk/\">paidContent:UK</a>:</strong><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.co.uk/entry/419-let-it-be-beatles-still-digital-hold-outs-coming-to-rock-band-game/\">Let It Be: Beatles, still digital hold-outs, coming to Rock Band game?</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.co.uk/entry/419-earnings-wpp-sales-up-in-thrid-quarter-expects-very-tough-2009/\">Earnings: WPP sales up in third quarter; expects 'very tough 2009'</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.co.uk/entry/419-econsports-and-econwomen-full-coverage-from-nyc/\">EconSports and EconWomen: Full coverage from NYC</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.co.uk/entry/419-g-day-t-mobiles-g1-phone-hits-uk-with-tactic-from-iphones-first-day-pla/\">G-Day: T-Mobile's G1 phone hits UK, with tactic from iPhone's first-day playbook</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.co.uk/entry/419-econwomen-tina-brown-id-hate-to-go-back-to-print/\">@ EconWomen: Tina Brown: I'd hate to go back to print</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.co.uk/entry/419-econsports-london-2012-nbc-says-its-learned-beijing-lessons/\">@ EconSports: London 2012: NBC says it's learned Beijing lessons</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.co.uk/entry/419-econsports-espn-on-euro-rebrand-rampage-fancies-premiership-rights/\">@ EconSports: ESPN on Euro rebrand rampage; fancies Premiership rights</a></p>",
  "<p>Not many days go by in Australia without a reminder of the general apathy about British rugby league. The England team had been expecting to attend a press conference in Melbourne earlier today ahead of Sunday's big game against the green and golds at the Telstra Dome, but were politely told that their presence was no longer required because of a far more pressing priority: a media launch for the first match of next season's State of Origin series between Queensland and New South Wales, which will be played on neutral territory in Victoria on June 3.</p> <p>If the England players had been invited, rather than left to arrange sight-seeing trips to Ramsay Street on their day off, they'd have heard Channel Nine's commentator Andrew Voss refer to Origin as \"the jewel in the crown of rugby league\". That's not a criticism of Voss, who showed that he's anything but an ignorant, arrogant Aussie in trying his best to talk up the patchy Poms with Peter Sterling and Laurie Daley during last Saturday's opening game against Papua New Guinea. But it was one more indication of the amount of damage that has been done to the prestige of the international game over the last four decades.</p> <p>You can't really blame the Aussies, either. For the 28 years since Arthur Beetson punched his Parramatta team-mate Mick Cronin to ensure the success of the first, experimental Origin game at Lang Park in 1980, the inter-state contest has been consistently compelling and unpredictable, while games against the Old Dart have too often been anything but.</p> <p>You don't have to be here long to see that for all the problems it's had in recent times Australian league remains light years ahead of the game in the northern hemisphere, at least in terms of its profile. It's the little, trivial things that sum up the gulf: the fact that the Sydney Morning Herald chose the rugby league controversy of the moment - grapple-tacking - to illustrate the closing stages of the US Presidential election, with Barack Obama in a South Sydney jumper being throttled by Melbourne's John McCain; the fact that Snoop Dogg has one of those Souths jumpers and has been parading it through the Block in Redfern with a few of the Rabbitohs players to promote a Sydney concert; the fact that Wally Lewis's son is now a star of Home and Away; the fact that Melbourne Storm are still regarded as a failure by some in Sydney because they \"only\" attract crowds of around 10,000 (what would Harlequins, their closest British equivalent, give for such problems?).</p> <p>As suggested in a previous blog - and at the risk of sounding like even more of an establishment creep - rather than moaning about various aspects of Australia's organisation of this World Cup, maybe we should just be grateful that enough of their administrators were prepared to host it at all. They've provided an open goal to the understandably cynical and insular local league media, and it isn't immediately obvious what they stand to gain.</p> <p>But there will be a big clue at the MCG on Friday night, with the second in an International Rules series between Australia and Ireland - the closest Aussie Rules gets to international competition, although from a distance it all seems a bit of a tricky business because even when the players aren't fighting, they have to compromise on the shape of the balls.</p> <p>It should still be worth a watch, at least if it doesn't clash with the equally genteel Samoa v Tonga soiree in Sydney. But the AFL administrators could only look on in envy if England were to stun Australia on the other side of Melbourne and breathe new life into league's World Cup - especially as there are expected to be around 5,000 England supporters at the game, the majority of whom have flown into Victoria this week.</p> <p>These early stages of the tournament have been a classic case of the glass being either half full or half empty. From this perspective, the games between England and the Kumuls in Townsville, Scotland and France in Canberra, and Ireland versus Tonga at Parramatta, have been thoroughly enjoyable occasions, celebrating rugby league's peculiar global range from industrial west Yorkshire to tropical north Queensland via Papua New Guinea and Catalonia, with the only damp squib so far coming from New Zealand's no-show in Sydney.</p> <p>A couple of the responses to the last blog focused on the empty seats and a local Australian row about television coverage - but anyone with memories of the last World Cup really shouldn't have such lofty expectations.</p> <p>Instead, we've got the prospect of four terrific games this weekend: tribal warfare at the foot of the Blue Mountains tomorrow; Fiji's eagerly-awaited debut against the equally appealing French in Wollongong on Saturday, followed by the cock-a-hoop Kumuls having a crack at the unconvincing Kiwis on the Gold Coast; and then the big one here in Melbourne on Sunday. Sorry, but I'm struggling to find anything to be miserable about.</p>",

The firm's Athens team appears to be deeply moved by the task. Some of the lyrics are quite horrifying.</p> <p>\"You always had a deep, strong belief when you said 'test your work, be probative',\" belts out a male baritone, before everyone raises their glass to their \"lovely preacher\".</p> <p>And as the US media website <a href=\"http://gawker.com/5069926/greeks-compose-worlds-most-embarrassing-tribute-song\">Gawker </a> points out, you can't rhyme David with \"avid\".

  "<p>The current financial crisis is symptomatic of a more fundamental disorder. The free market aristocrats locking their twelve pointers on the trading floor betray a peculiarly male volatility, of point scoring, dick-measuring ferocity. </p> <p>Their behaviour derives from a testosterone surge that is reproducing a hyper-male culture of medieval intensity. The core issue is gender. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/oct/22/autism-testosterone\">Top Gear mentality</a> of inflated masculinity is apparent on pitch, screen, and page; in the boxing ring, corridor, committee, front bench and boardroom. </p> <p>It is on display in the brutalism of raunch culture with its lad mags and roasting. </p> <p>It is celebrated by the predominance of diamond geezers, jack-the-lads, slacker dudes, dumbed down fatherhood, an infantilised version of true masculinity. </p> <p>It is applauded by the moronic kindergarten blatherings of 'men' programmed into perpetual puerility by a revival of aggressive patriarchy. </p> <p>Most shamefully, it is exposed by the increasing use of rape as a means of dominance in the home and on the battlefield. </p> <p>In all these arenas, maleman struts his atavistic stuff.</p> <p>There was a time when macho-masculinity was fit for purpose. Twelve thousand years ago, during and following the thaw, we needed action man, with 'a little less conversation please'. </p> <p>As humanity struggled to survive a period of elemental chaos then establish order, structure and organisation, the soft fingers of social literacy were subordinate to the hard fist of physical control.</p> <p>This is no longer the case. There is a new ethos, in which care has priority over enterprise, the housekeeper over the entrepreneur, stewardship over expansion. </p> <p>EQ now outpoints IQ. </p> <p>Technology has transformed the work place, replacing the masculine qualities of muscle, system, specialism and dictation with the feminine aptitudes of dexterity, multi-tasking and negotiation. </p> <p>The emphasis within human organisation and business has moved from competition to collaboration, with a new emphasis on 'others'. This is seen in support systems, restorative justice, health and safety, and a therapy culture for victims, whether of trauma or disadvantage.</p> <p>The new human narrative is creating an essentially feminine paradigm. </p> <p>It is possible that the resurgence of masculinity is simply a cry of protest from a gender in decline, as it faces up to the redundancy of those qualities by which it has hitherto dominated the stage.</p> <p>The current financial crisis serves to expose the masculine model as unfit for 21st century purpose. </p> <p>Global management requires an economy of maintenance based on household need, not one of expansion driven by tribal greed. If the human vehicle is to reach a fourth millennium, then men need to take a back seat.</p>",

  "<p>Uganda has lost 25bn Ugandan shillings ($12m) of Global Fund money due to concerns over poor accountability, according to reports this week.</p> <p>The Global Fund has refused to release a second $10m instalment from the $36m pot it allocated for HIV/Aids activities in Uganda in 2003 because it was not satisfied with how initial payments have been spent, reported <strong><a href=\"http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/12/656872\">New Vision</a></strong>. </p> <p>A further $2m is yet to be disbursed from the $24m allocated for malaria work under the Global Fund in 2004.</p> <p>In 2005 Uganda was suspended from the Global Fund over irregularities in the administration of funds. This year, the Ugandan government began proceedings to prosecute those accused of embezzling Global Fund money, including two former health ministers. </p> <p>Aidspan, the independent watchdog that monitors Global Fund activities worldwide, said Uganda failed to satisfy the fund that the arrangements put in place after its suspension were robust enough to protect its money from misuse.</p> <p>In an interview with New Vision, an Aidspan representative said the $12m grants were now so far behind schedule that they \"become irredeemable\".</p> <p>The news comes in the same week that the <strong><a href=\"http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/13/656833\">Uganda Aids Commission</a></strong> said Uganda requires an estimated 1.3tr Ugandan shillings ($700m) over the next 18 months to finance vital HIV/Aids activities.</p> <p>The commission said that 25% of this sum should go towards prevention and 50% towards treatment, care and delivery of drugs and services.</p> <p>This week has also seen groups representing people living with HIV and Aids <strong><a href=\"http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/13/656841\">reject</a></strong> Uganda's new draft HIV/Aids prevention and control bill 2008.</p> <p>The draft bill criminalises the intentional transmission of HIV. The National Forum of People Living with HIV/Aids Networks in Uganda said that the country should avoid creating scenarios where people living with HIV/Aids are looked on as criminals.</p> <h2>Health system criticised</h2> <p>Uganda's decentralised health system is to blame for the poor delivery of health services across the country, according to health minister Stephen Mallinga. </p> <p>Speaking at the 14th health sector joint review meeting in Kampala on Monday, Mallinga said the decentralised recruitment of health workers had led to a culture of \"tribalism\", with many health workers recruited and remaining within their own home regions, reported the <strong><a href=\"http://www.monitor.co.ug/artman/publish/regional-special/Decentralisation_blamed_for_poor_health_service_73863.shtml \">Daily Monitor</a></strong>.</p> <p>This has led to an uneven distribution of qualified health workers across the country, particularly in regions with few of its own qualified medical staff. <br> Mallinga added that decentralisation was also thwarting health workers' chances of being promoted and transferred to other regions.</p> <p>\"Once you are recruited to Kisoro you are likely to be tied up there forever without getting an opportunity to upgrade and be promoted,\" he said.</p> <p>At the same meeting the Belgium ambassador to Uganda, Jan de Bruyne, warned that Uganda is off-track to meet the Millennium Development Goals on reducing child and maternal mortality as a consequence of its \"poor healthcare system\".</p> <h2>Economic troubles continue </h2> <p>Uganda's economic woes continued this week with an estimated 114bn Ugandan shillings ($54m) wiped off the local stock market in one day. </p> <p>The losses recorded on October 27 were the result of panic selling by stockbrokers in the Uganda Securities Exchange, reported the <strong><a href=\"http://www.monitor.co.ug/artman/publish/news/Investors_lose_24b_in_Kampala_in_one_day_73878.shtml\">Daily Monitor</a></strong>. Of the losses, Shs 23.6bn evaporated from six locally listed companies, including Uganda Clays, New Vision and the Bank of Baroda.</p> <p>Despite assurances from the Bank of Uganda and the government that the economy would weather the global financial downturn with minimal effect, confidence among local investors is falling.</p> <p>Last week the shilling collapsed against the dollar, falling to a low of Shs 2,200. As a result fuel prices have spiked, with a litre of petrol rising by nearly Shs 300. </p> <p>With Uganda's heavy dependency on foreign imports, prices of other goods are expected to start rising soon. </p> <p>The governor of the Bank of Uganda, Emmanuel Tumusiime Mutebile, attributed the scarcity of dollars to a fall in remittances from Ugandans working abroad who have lost their jobs or had their work hours cut.</p> <h2>No cut in aid to Africa</h2> <p>The global financial downturn will not see donors slash aid to Africa, according to the World Bank.</p> <p>Despite the widespread belief that western countries hit by a faltering global economy will renege on aid commitments, Shanta Devarajan, the World Bank's chief economist for the Africa region, says that reduction in foreign aid among donor countries is still a long way off. </p> <p>Writing on his World Bank blog last week, <strong><a href=\"http://africacan.worldbank.org/\">africacan.worldbank.org</a></strong>, he said: \"Two things need to happen for the crisis to lead to a significant reduction in foreign aid. First, the financial crisis has to lead to a major recession in donor countries. Second, the recession leads to such fiscal constraints that foreign aid is cut.\"</p> <p>He argued that the world is not yet at this stage of economic decline and that aid is motivated largely by non-economic factors.</p> <p>His comments followed an appeal from the chairman of the African Union, the Tanzanian president Jakaya Kikwete, to the west not to cut aid to Africa.</p> <p>Concerns have been also raised by Uganda's Central Bank that Uganda will face deep cuts in development funding as donor countries pour millions into shoring up faltering financial institutions. </p> <p>This week some of the world's largest NGOs confirmed they were revising budgets, cutting staff and reviewing their 2009 programmes of funding and activity. </p> <p>Robert Zachritz, World Vision's director of advocacy and government relations, told <strong><a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/200810271825.html\">IRIN news</a></strong> he believed micro-credit programmes could be particularly hit. </p> <p>\"Much of this [micro-finance credit] relies on getting loans from banks, which is going to be a real challenge in the near future. Losing this credit is a huge problem for the world's poor, small-scale farmers.\"</p> <h2>Carbon finance for African farmers</h2> <p>Environmental experts are examining ways in which the billions of dollars available under the Kyoto Protocol could be used to help improve the lives of farmers across Africa.</p> <p>Earlier this week, more than 100 experts from five continents met in the US to discuss ways in which carbon finance could be used to help fund <strong><a href=\"http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2008/1000947/index.html\">agricultural development in some of the world's poorest countries</a></strong>. </p> <p>Carbon finance has been developed under the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), whereby industrialised nations can fulfil their commitments to reducing their carbon footprint by investing in emission-saving projects overseas. </p> <p>To qualify for funding, agricultural projects in Africa would have to be able to scientifically prove how much they can reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared with traditional farming methods.</p> <p>Issues debated at the meeting included the potential for new sustainable production intensification (SPI) technology that would reduce tilling of land, which releases CO2 trapped in the soil into the atmosphere.</p> <p>According to news agency IRIN, systems under discussion include Conservation Agriculture, a method where seeds are drilled directly into the ground. </p> <p>\"This is a win-win-win opportunity,\" said Theodor Friedrich, an expert in SPI. \"We have a chance to slow climate change, help poor farmers make a better living and improve soil health and productivity all at the same time.\"</p> <p>He pointed out that developing non-tillage methods of farming would directly benefit small-hold farmers in Africa as soil that is rich in carbon is also more adaptable to the higher temperatures and increasingly erratic rainfall that are the expected outcomes of global climactic change.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown today called on the banks to keep lending to small businesses despite the global credit crunch.</p> <p>The prime minister welcomed a commitment by the European Investment Bank to make \u00a34bn available to provide finance to firms in the UK.</p> <p>Following talks in Downing Street with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, Brown said it was now up to the banks in Britain to honour their commitments.</p> <p>\"We must continue to encourage banks to lend. Having re-capitalised the banks we must ensure that the money is used to sustain credit lines on normal terms to solvent businesses,\" he said.</p> <p>\"I urge banks not to change the terms and charges for existing lending to small and medium sized enterprises.\"</p> <p>The prime minister said the wider economic problems could only be dealt with through concerted international action.</p> <p>He said it was now essential that the International Monetary Fund played a central role in preventing the crisis spreading.</p> <p>\"This is a global problem that requires a global solution. No country, no matter how big, can solve these problems on their own,\" he said.</p> <p>The prime minister also hinted that the UK government was poised to take further action to support businesses and families at this \"time of international crisis\".</p> <p>Flanked by Merkel at a joint press conference, Brown said the two were \"determined to continue the cooperation between our countries\".</p> <p>\"We need comprehensive action, not just nationally but internationally, we need to come together to build confidence in the international system,\" Brown said. \"We have now to show the financial system has been cleaned up in such a way that people can have confidence in it.\"</p> <p>Asked whether the government should step in to demand a further cut in interest rates, Brown dodged the question, insisting a \"comprehensive set of measures\" were needed to tackle the problem.</p> <p>That included interest rates.</p> <p>He added: \"I think you will find in the next few days we will do more to help families and small businesses.\"<br> Merkel said it was importand to learn from the crisis and encourage banks to use the help being made available to them.</p> <p>\"We have learned,\" she said. \"But we need more transparency, strengthening of the IMF role\u2026 and more global division of labour.\"</p> <p>The talks were part of an intense round of international discussions on the global economic crisis.</p> <p>They came comes two days after the prime minister travelled to Paris for talks with the French president, Nicolas Sarkzoy, and ahead of a four-day trip to the Gulf for talks with oil-producing countries.</p> <p>European leaders will gather in the French capital on November 7 to prepare their approach to a larger-scale summit in Washington on November 15, which will bring together the world's 20 biggest economies.</p> <p>As efforts continued to deal with fallout from the crisis in the \"real\" economy, the British chancellor, Alistair Darling, urged UK banks to help get the new simplified loans out to small businesses, which were \"vital to the strength of our economy\".</p> <p>The chancellor said: \"We need to make sure that despite the global credit crunch, they have access to the loans and capital they need to help their businesses grow and develop.\"</p> <p>He said the EIB's commitment would enable banks to get more finance to small firms and ensure the funding was more flexible and easier to access than in the past.</p> <p>\"This announcement will ensure British businesses get a fair share of European lending, and can access the best support available during these challenging times,\" said Darling.</p> <p>\"I welcome the strong support we have received from UK banks and I hope that as many banks as possible will participate in this scheme.\"</p> <p>The chancellor last night defended the government's decision to increase borrowing to help kick-start economic recovery, saying it would be \"perverse\" to apply Gordon Brown's famous fiscal rules on government borrowing in a \"rigid manner\" when the economy was on the brink of recession.</p> <p>But he pledged to stick to Labour's underlying principles for running the economy and to rebuild the public finances once the current financial \"shocks\" have worked their way through the system.</p> <p>The chancellor also warned of \"short and long-term challenges, placing extraordinary pressure on the tax revenues\" - seen as a nod towards the possible need for future tax rises.</p> <p>Today, the chancellor refused to add his voice to those calling for a further and significant interest rate cut but indicated there was scope for such a move.</p>",

But can it work the other way round? Maybe. Think of top model, Milla Jovovich who seems to have successfully accomplished a whole host of creative ventures: anything from producing her own folk music album in 1994 (it gained critical acclaim apparently, despite being recorded by Milla at age 16 and her inspiration being <a href=\"http://www.millaj.com/bio.shtml\">a love of elves and magic trees</a>) to what people thought would be her breakthrough role as Leeloo in Luc Besson's The Fifth Element \u2026 until Joan of Arc bombed a couple of years later.</p> <p>But Milla's failure hasn't deterred Tom Ford, former creative director at the Gucci Group, who is to make his <a href=\"http://www.drapersonline.com/news/2008/10/tom_ford_to_direct_new_film.html\">directorial debut</a> in a film adaptation of Christopher Isherwood's 1964 novel A Single Man penned by Ford and David Scearce. The film, which follows a single day in a professor's life in Los Angeles, will reportedly star Colin Firth, Julianne Moore and Matthew Goode. We can't wait to see if Ford's creative flair works as well on the big screen as it does on the catwalk. </p> <h2>BANG ON TREND</h2> <p><strong>Tailored jackets</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-339150074\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2008/10/30/LivTyler140x200.jpg\" alt=\"Liv Tyler at the opening of the new Burberry store in Los Angeles\" width=\"140\" height=\"200\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liv Tyler.

We had such fun, didn't we? Perhaps you should consider handing over your sonic screwdriver to one of the following \u2026 <br></p> <p>It is a shame that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/oct/30/doctorwho-television\">Tennant is leaving Doctor Who</a>. The programme has been fantastic over the past four years, largely due to how he took the role by the scruff of the neck, incorporated aspects of his predecessors, but made it his own. What were your favourite Tennant moments?</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.paddypower.com/bet?action=go_event&amp;category=SPECIALS&amp;class_sort=--&amp;ev_id=775393&amp;ev_class_id=72&amp;ev_type_id=7771&amp;force_racing_css=N\">Betting shop Paddy Power has a list of contenders to become the next doctor</a>, which I only mention to discount it. It puts Paterson Joseph, who appeared as Roderick in the Doctor Who episodes Bad Wolf and Parting of the Ways, as favourite at 3-1 to become the first black Doctor Who.</p> <p>But BBC Wales, which produces <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/\">Doctor Who</a>, has not even begun searching for a replacement.</p> <p>The problem with such lists is that every utterance on this subject has usually been refracted through second-guessing what executive producer Russell T Davies thinks.</p> <p>Thus Davies makes a favourable comment about Russell Tovey, who appeared in the play The History Boys and his role as Midshipman Frame in the Kylie Minogue Christmas special, Voyage of the Damned, and he is suddenly a contender.</p> <p>In the end, it is really incoming executive producer Steven Moffat's decision. And he has barely said anything about anything.</p> <p>Here is the beginnings of a list, which I hope you can continue.</p> <p><strong>Bill Nighy </strong></p> <p>Missed out when the role went to Christopher Eccleston. Was superb and somewhat doctorish as the newspaper editor in State of Play.<br><strong><br>Stephen Fry </strong></p> <p>Would be hugely popular in the role. And talented enough to mould the part into something new. But would the ultimate renaissance man surrender 10 months of his life and his plethora of TV appearances for a single part? Eccleston found it gruelling and left after just one year. </p> <p><strong>Alexander Armstrong <br></strong><br>At a loose end now that he has pulled out of hosting Countdown at the 11th hour. But the Doctor as a hooray henry?</p> <p><strong>James Nesbitt</strong></p> <p>The Cold Feet star has been connected with the role, even on the pages of MediaGuardian.co.uk, but it is hard to see fans warming to him.</p> <p><strong>Rupert Penry-Jones</strong></p> <p>His time in Spooks makes it clear that he would be an action man, but is he too pretty to play a Timelord?</p> <p><strong><br>Paul O'Grady </strong></p> <p>Jon Pertwee was a comic actor before he took the role, but he played the third Doctor completely straight. O'Grady would be an out there choice, but probably unaffordable. I don't know why the idea appeals to me.</p> <p>Tom Baker left the programme in 1981, and he had a bit of fun at his press conference by wishing the next doctor luck \"whomever he or she is\". This leading to a frenzy of speculation that the next doctor could be a woman. Is now the right time? </p> <p><strong>Joanna Lumley </strong></p> <p>She was mentioned as a candidate to replace Baker but producers were never that serious about the idea and Peter Davison won the role. After her star turn in the 1999 Comic Relief special, the Curse of Fatal Death, written by Steven Moffat, the idea is even more attractive now. </p> <p><strong>Alex Kingston</strong> </p> <p>Put in a sterling performance as Professor River Song in the Silence in the Library. And handing the role to someone who has previously appeared in the series has a precedent \u2013 sixth Doctor Colin Baker appeared as a guard in the series, even shooting his predecessor, the fifth Doctor.</p> <p>Every actor in Britain would kill for the role. But the person who lands it may well surprise us.</p>",
  "<p>Who came up with the term \"clean coal\"? It is the most toxic phrase in the greenwash lexicon. George W Bush, by promising to pump hundreds of millions of dollars into the pursuit of advanced \"clean\" coal technologies, certainly popularised it. But I'd love to know where it came from. Any thoughts out there?</p> <p>It is, of course, oxymoronic. Coal is about acid rain and peasouper smogs, asthma and mercury contamination, radioactive waste emissions and ripping apart mountains, killing trees, lung cancer and, of course, global warming. </p> <p>Coal emits more carbon dioxide for every unit of energy generated than any other fuel. Sure you can clean it up a bit \u2013 though the toxins you've taken out of the ground have to go somewhere. But clean coal? Just say no.</p> <p>But the phrase rolls on. Google offers more than a million web pages. We will hear a lot more of it as the UK government wrestles with whether to approve a new billion-pound \"cleaner coal\" power station \u2013 Britain's first coal plant for three decades \u2013 at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/11/kingsnorthclimatecamp.activists\">Kingsnorth in Kent</a>.<br> E.ON, the company that wants to build the station, says Kingsnorth will be \"ready\" to capture carbon dioxide emissions before they go up the stack. Great, except there is no such technology right now. </p> <p>This phrase \"clean coal\" has developed a life of its own thanks to remorseless commercial propagandising. This year a coalition of US coal mining companies and electricity utilities called Americans for Balanced Energy Choices (and recently renamed the <a href=\"http://www.cleancoalusa.org/\">American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity</a>) is paying the advertising agency R&amp;R Partners $35m (\u00a322m) to promote \"clean coal\" through advertising and other promotional activity.</p> <p>This is up there with the safe cigarette and \"atoms for peace\". The industry is fighting back against growing scientific calls to outlaw coal burning, and the rejection of dozens of coal power plants proposals by communities across the US, with several states effectively banning them.</p> <p>You may have noticed the campaign's effect. Both John McCain and Barack Obama support clean coal. It's neat. Who could be against clean coal? It allows them to oppose dirty coal without antagonising anyone. You may not have spotted that Americans for Balanced Energy Choices sponsored two early presidential debates, during which \u2013 guess what \u2013 no questions were asked about global warming.</p> <p>And here in Britain you can see the impact of the new mantra. In Putney, in southwest London, there is a branch of the International Energy Agency that used to be called the Coal Research Centre. It's changed its name \u2013 to the Clean Coal Centre. Thanks to its \"industrial sponsors\" it is able to \"provide unbiased information on the sustainable use of coal worldwide.\" Right. Like the fact there isn't any?</p> <p>Is clean coal possible in future? Well, if you mean could we <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/05/carboncapturestorage.carbonemissions\">capture carbon dioxide emissions</a> and bury them somewhere out of harm's way \u2013 in old coal seams or oilfields or salt mines \u2013 yes, it is possible. The former British chief scientist Sir David King called it \"the only hope for mankind\".</p> <p>But the most authoritative study, <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/coal/\">The Future of Coal</a>, published last year by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), concluded that the first commercial carbon capture and storage (CCS) plant wouldn't come on stream until 2030 at the earliest. </p> <p>Last year too, the Edison Electric Institute, which represents most US power generators, admitted to a House Select Committee in Washington DC that commercial deployment will require 25 years research costing at least $20bn. </p> <p>And that was before the US administration last December canned the biggest R&amp;D project on the technology anywhere in the world. It said it was too costly and hinted that, for all their green talk, industry wasn't prepared to back it.</p> <p>Oh, and if the technology did one day work \u2013 and could demonstrate that it could keep liquefied carbon dioxide buried for the thousands of years necessary \u2013 it would take decades to build the vast infrastructure needed to deploy on a large scale. Infrastructure that could only be paid for by maintaining a vast dirty coal-burning industry for the duration.</p> <p>But politicians can be very ill-read if it suits them. The mythology of clean coal has penetrated deep into their thinking round the world because it is so convenient. In Australia, the new green-minded prime minister Kevin Rudd is super-keen on \"clean coal\" because he imagines it allows him to promise both to meet Australia's Kyoto protocol pledges and to assuage the concerns of industry. </p> <p>Coal provides most of Australia's electricity and is it most valuable export. But you can't meet current emissions targets with a technology 20 years over the horizon.</p> <p>Similarly German chancellor Angela Merkel, though a chemist by training, has fallen for the hope that she can both build dozens of new coal-fired power stations and meet her promise to cut German CO2 emissions by 40% by 2020. It won't happen.</p> <p>The British government is as deep into clean-coal cuckoo land as any of them. John Hutton, until recently business secretary, claimed that a third of British electricity could be generated using CCS by 2030 \u2013 clearly pie in the sky. He should fire the adviser who wrote that for him. The mirage of clean coal is designed to coax the world into maintaining its addiction to the most dangerous (and profuse) fossil fuel of all. My bet is that if Kingsnorth is approved, it will never deliver so much as a tonne of carbon dioxide to anywhere other than the atmosphere. </p> <p>\u2022 How many more green scams, cons and generous slices of wishful thinking are out there?

It has threatened to cut off cooperation on Iraqi border security if there are more raids on its territory.</p> <p>Syrian security around the embassy is usually tight and Americans in the country are generally made to feel welcome but when the US invaded Iraq protesters attacked the embassy.</p> <p>The American school has been shut for the day. The Syrian government has ordered the school to shut down - this is expected within a week - and the immediate closing of the American cultural centre linked to the embassy.</p> <p>In Washington, a state department deputy spokesman, Robert Wood, said yesterday that the White House was considering how to respond to the order to shut the cultural centre and American school. He stressed that the US expected the Syrian government to \"provide adequate security for the buildings\". The US embassy warned its citizens in Syria to be vigilant.</p> <p>There has been no formal acknowledgment of the raid from Washington, but US officials speaking on condition of anonymity have said it killed Badran Turki al-Mazidih, a top al-Qaida figure who operated a network smuggling fighters into Iraq. An Iraqi national, he also uses the name Abu Ghadiyah.</p> <p>Washington lists Syria as a state sponsor of terrorism and has operated sanctions since 2004. In recent months Damascus has been trying to end years of global isolation.

I feel your fear.</p> <p>At the <a href=\"http://funvampires.com/2007/04/18/england-belongs-to-twee/\">England Belongs to Twee</a> disco in Philadelphia, the evening usually starts with an hour or so of \"really intense Oi! to drive away the normals,\" says twoi godfather Mike McKee, who's been co-running the night for two years. And then things usually get mental. <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/bmxbanditsgroup\">BMX Bandits</a> might follow the Business followed by the <a href=\"http://www.twee.net/Bands/s/seaurchins.html\">Sea Urchins</a> and then Blitz.</p> <p>\"And it can get confusing,\" says McKee. \"Like when you're asked for some <a href=\"http://helplessdancer.vox.com/library/post/where-are-they-now---tallulah-gosh.html\">Tallulah Gosh</a> by a hulking skinhead in a West Ham shirt. Or when a skinny librarian type asks for some <a href=\"http://www.cockneyrejects.eu/\">Cockney Rejects</a>.\"</p> <p>One such twoi disco ended with an elongated version of Yackety Sax, says McKee, \"and 10 skinheads chasing their girlfriends around the dancefloor in a circle, <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=spz8_rpE0e0\">pretending that their clothes were falling off</a>.\"</p> <p>Twoi (not to be confused with Croi, which is crusty Oi! and a different kettle of stinking fish altogether) is, of course, both a musical oxymoron and an abomination in the eyes of the Lord. But it matters not a jot to these Philadelphians that back in Blighty the Oi!-sters and the tweekids are mods-versus-rockers style deadly enemies who fight like cat and dog.</p> <p>I told Fat Bob from ultra-Oi! band <a href=\"http://www.eyeweekly.com/music/liveeye/article/27449\">Hard Skin</a> about England Belongs to Twee <a href=\"http://e6.video.blip.tv/0690003555437/Phillyweekly-WhatsGayer806.m4v\">when he visited Philadelphia recently</a>. He nearly puked with disgust.</p> <p>\"That's fucking disgusting, England doesn't belong to twee. England belongs to hard,\" said Bob, who habitually refers to Belle and Sebastian as \"Bell End Sebastian\".</p> <p>He was seemingly unaware that posh girls in nice frocks and \"Twee as Fuck\" T-shirts would be in attendance at that night's Hard Skin show. He also seemed unaware that his driver on this US tour was none other than Mike McKee - the very same Philly promoter who is cross-breeding rough-as-fuck Oi! with its mock-posh, pony-owning cousin, presumably in a bizarre attempt to produce really annoying smug, tuneless, passive-aggressive baby skinhead offspring <a href=\"http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/?inc=article&amp;id=289&amp;x=which-is-gayer-a-skinhead-punk-rock-show-or-a-belle-and-sebastian-disco&amp;_c=music\">that you'd want to punch but daren't</a>. </p> <p>One can only think that this genre confusion in the minds of American youth arose when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/morrissey\">Morrissey</a> briefly flirted with skinhead imagery in the 1980s. But how this heresy has managed to not only persist in the era of transatlantic travel and instantaneous global communications is something of a mystery. </p> <p>Twoi has parallels with reggae - which was born when Jamaican musicians mixed Caribbean music with the rock'n'roll they heard coming over the radio from Miami. Has twoi similarly spawned a hybrid? Horrifically the answer is yes - and from the most unlikely source.</p> <p>It turns out that Fat Bob is an Oi! traitor. Hard Skin - inarguably the hardest, Oi!-est and thus the best live band on the planet - have been collaborating with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amelia_Fletcher\">Amelia Fletcher</a> - twee godmother and founder of super-seminal jolly-hockeysticks twee combo Tallulah Gosh - on a twoi album tentatively titled (and I am not making this up) Ten Birds, Twenty Tits.</p> <p>It might have started in the US, but now twoi has flashed back across the Atlantic and infected the homeland. The result will almost certainly be the rise of a class of \"Twee as Fuck\" T-shirt wearing thug-fops - the Viz character <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raffles,_Gentleman_Thug\">Raffles, Gentleman Thug</a> made flesh.</p> <p>I have seen the future.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/houseprices\">House prices</a> have slumped by 14.6% since last October after 12 consecutive months of falls, Nationwide Building Society said today.</p> <p>Figures from the UK's largest society show the average price of a home in the UK has fallen to \u00a3158,872 - almost \u00a330,000 less than a year ago. Prices have been driven down by falling sales volumes.</p> <p>Although the monthly fall of 1.4% was slightly lower than in September, when prices dropped by 1.5%, the annual rate of decline has increased from 12.4% last month and is the largest drop ever recorded by Nationwide.</p> <p>The figures are in sharp contrast with October last year when Nationwide last reported a monthly price rise. At that point annual price growth was running at 9.7% and the impact of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">credit crunch</a> was only starting to be felt by would-be buyers. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/mortgages\">Mortgage</a> approvals were also running in line with their long-term average and 40% of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/firsttimebuyers\">first-time buyers</a> were borrowing more than 90% of their home's value.</p> <p>Now lenders have pulled back from offering large loans and withdrawn many of their most competitive deals, and housing activity has plummeted. <br> Nationwide said the number of completed house purchase transactions as a proportion of the total stock of mortgages was now at its lowest ever level since records began in 1974.</p> <p>Meanwhile, other data shows the time taken to sell a property has increased by more than 60% in the last year, to almost 12 weeks. Nationwide said the housing market had stalled because buyers and sellers had reached a stalemate.</p> <p>The society's chief economist, Fionnuala Earley, said: \"The sharp falls in prices recorded by the main transactions-based measures of house prices has not yet led to an increase in market activity. </p> <p>\"One possible explanation for this is that it is only those sellers willing to negotiate on price that are seeing sales go through. While others refuse to cut their price, the levels of activity are constrained.\"</p> <p>She added: \"Asking prices have fallen this year, but the rate of decline has been significantly behind that of other measures. Consumers still expect prices to continue to fall into 2009 and will therefore be reluctant to trade without some discount on the asking price.\"</p> <h2>Fewer forced sales</h2> <p>Earley said the fact sellers felt they were able to hold out on price suggested there were fewer forced sales than during the last crash of the early 1990s, when interest rates were more than twice today's level. </p> <p>However, she said the weakening economy could force some people to reassess their needs and lower their expectations and prices.</p> <p>\"As the economy weakens further there is likely to be more movement on asking prices as sellers adjust to the prevailing conditions and reassess their own needs,\" she said.</p> <p>\"Some may choose not to sell after all, thus reducing supply, but others will adjust their prices accordingly. A looming recession and continued financial market instability have uncomfortable implications for the housing and mortgage markets, and will undoubtedly affect the pace of recovery in house prices.\"</p> <p>Daniel Lee of property website Globrix said that in some towns and cities homeowners were finding it \"almost impossible\" to sell. </p> <p>\"It's gridlock. I can't see things improving in the near term, either. Buyer confidence is shot to bits, mortgage finance is a lot tougher to secure and many sellers still aren't dropping their prices to realistic levels. </p> <p>\"They're in 2008 but have a 2005 mindset.\"</p> <p>Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said there was a strong chance prices would fall for at least another year. </p> <p>\"Although the monthly rate of decline in house prices has slowed marginally over the last couple of months, it is still pretty hefty and the housing market fundamentals remain largely ugly,\" he said.</p> <p>Nationwide's figures will make grim reading for borrowers who bought properties at the peak of the market last summer. Earlier this week the Bank of England said around 500,000 homeowners held mortgages that were bigger than the value of their property and that a further 15% fall in prices could result in 1.2 million borrowers facing negative equity.</p>",
  "<p>British gadget fans will be able to get their hands on the first mobile phone powered by Google today, as the much-anticipated G1 goes on sale in the UK for the first time.</p> <p>The G1, which is being sold by the phone network T-Mobile, will be available from the company's shops from as early as 7am \u2013 with thousands of people expected to queue in order be among the first buyers.</p> <p>A T-Mobile spokeswoman told the Guardian that the company was not sure how great demand would be today, but said 25,000 people had registered their interest since the phone was unveiled in New York last month.</p> <p>The G1 comes free with a \u00a340-a-month contract and boasts a number of high-end features including global satellite positioning, wireless internet access and built-in support for a number of Google applications.</p> <p>It is the internet giant's backing which has generated most interest, as the California company attempts to move into the lucrative mobile phone market and take on rivals such as Nokia, BlackBerry and Microsoft. But the G1's major competition looks set to be Apple's iPhone.</p> <p>The launch represents a big gamble for Google, which has only recently started producing full-blown software rather than internet-based applications. But engineers based in California and London have been working on the phone system, called Android, for the past three years, and the company hopes that a number of manufacturers will sign up to use its software. Wider take-up will have to wait until next year, though, since T-Mobile has negotiated an exclusive 12-month deal to run Android on its phones.</p> <p>Despite the excitement over the launch, reaction to the G1 so far has been mixed. Leading gadget blog <a href=\"http://uk.gizmodo.com/smartphones/\">Gizmodo</a> said that it was not the finished article but represented \"a good start\", while <a href=\"http://reviews.cnet.com/htc-dream-t-mobile-g1/\">technology review site CNET</a> called it \"weird\"\u201a and said it was \"not quite there yet\".</p> <p>In the US, where the handset went on sale yesterday, retailers are already starting to slash the G1's price to boost sales.</p>",
  "<p>It was not an election so much as a coronation: Cristina Kirchner swept to Argentina's presidency a year ago as political royalty and was hailed the most powerful woman in Latin America.</p> <p>\"Queen Cristina\", as she was dubbed, won a historic landslide on the promise of consolidating an economic recovery that had restored Argentine pride and optimism.</p> <p>Twelve months later the scene is transformed. Kirchner is deeply unpopular and besieged by mounting problems that have soured her rule and the country's mood, a remarkable and rapid fall from grace.</p> <p>This month brought fresh bad news: a renewed farmers' strike, economic turmoil, disloyalty from the vice-president and embarrassing allegations about a suitcase filled with cash. This week, Argentina's stock market tumbled to a five-year low after the government announced a plan to nationalise the country's private pension funds. </p> <p>As a result of all this, the president's approval ratings have collapsed to below 30%. </p> <p>\"Inflation is the biggest problem,\" said Victoria Donda, a member of Congress from the leftist Libres del Sur party. \"People now have jobs but they aren't earning enough to cover even their most basic needs.\" Kirchner's administration is accused by critics of bungling Argentina's economy independently of the global downturn and of compounding the mess with political miscalculations. \"The crisis in Argentina is not financial or economic, it is political,\" said Maria Eugenia Estenssoro of the opposition Civic Coalition party.</p> <p>The president, 55, who shuns interview requests, has defended her record and launched scathing counter-attacks. She accused farmers of coup-plotting, the media of distortion and the US of waging a vendetta.</p> <p>Signs of trouble were evident in the flush of last year's triumph. Kirchner, a veteran Peronist senator, won power on the coat-tails of her husband Nestor, a popular president who stepped down after overseeing a robust recovery from Argentina's 2001 economic collapse.</p> <p>The glamorous first lady evoked Evita and Hilary Clinton but owed her landslide to a fractious and outgunned opposition. The economy, however, was weaker than it seemed and analysts said inflation was perhaps triple the offical rate of 9%, a figure widely viewed as a product of government fiddling. Kirchner stuck to the discredited figure, losing credibility and a finance minister in the process, and provoked a calamitous battle with farmers by raising taxes on Argentina's main export, soy, to try to plug gaps in the budget.</p> <p>A four-month farmers' strike ended in a humiliating government climbdown and revived angst that the instability which haunted the nation for half a century had returned. Farmers, citing fresh grievances, have warned of further strikes which could further disrupt crucial exports. A drought, which some experts said was the worst on record, has withered crops and pasture.</p> <p>The country's finances also appear shaky with debt rising to \u00a359bn, or 56% of GDP. To calm market fears Kirchner last month made surprise offers to holders of bonds and Paris Club creditors who were stung by the country's 2001 default.</p> <p>The human rights lawyer-turned politician promised to ease inequality but here too she has struggled. Poverty has climbed for the first time in six years, largely because of inflation, and analysts say young Peronists are disillusioned with a government increasingly reliant on trade union support.</p> <p>\"People are looking for alternatives, for a break with Kirchnerism,\" said Javier Quiroga, a voluntary relief work in Jose C Paz, a municipality with large pockets of poverty outside Buenos Aires.</p> <p>Kirchner's standing has not been helped by evidence that her husband is meddling behind the scenes and that Venezuela's president, Hugo Chavez, is a clandestine sugar daddy.</p> <p>A trial underway in Miami has heard testimony that a suitcase with $800,000 in cash impounded at Buenos Aires airport last year was a clandestine payment from Caracas to her election campaign. Both leaders have branded the trial a \"garbage\" US smear but, in a sign of the case's sensitivity, have avoided being photographed together.</p> <p>To add to her woes \"Queen Cristina\" is stuck with an insurgent vice-president, Julio Cobos. Plucked from an opposition party to broaden her appeal, relations between the two have broken down and they no longer speak.</p> <p>Cobos, who helped the farmers defeat the govenment, has been shut out of policymaking but constitutionally cannot be fired. He has capitalised on that unusual position to become Argentina's most popular politician and to lay the ground for a possible presidential bid in 2011.</p> <p>\"The vice-president is stronger than the president. Congress is modifying everything she sends there. Unions are asking for huge wage increases,\" Joaquin Morales Sola, a political commentator, told Reuters.</p> <p>But nobody is writing off the president. Argentina's economy remains in good shape compared to its traumatic 2001 collapse, and she has three years and the Peronist party machinery to regain the initiative.</p> <p>A Kirchner ally and Peronist senator, Eric Calcagno, defended the president as a champion of equality who was facing a backlash from entrenched, priviliged interests. \"The farm strike is a message from Argentina's establishment against the redistribution of income,\" said Calcagno, who is also an economist and former ambassador to France.</p> <p>\"After the economic crisis in 2001, the Argentine establishment accepted becoming a minority partner in a political project it doesn't really agree with, but now that the economy has been solved, the message is: we want you out.\"</p>",
  "<p>Seven or so years ago, a friend of mine suggested an outing to the British premiere of an opera by Karlheinz Stockhausen. Stockhausen had been working on an opera cycle for years, each section named after a day of the week. I remembered the thrill of seeing Donnerstag at the Royal Opera House 16 years before, with the throb of anticipation in the crowd on the first night, and, afterwards, the trumpeters on the roof of the Opera House calling out their valedictory fanfares to a bewildered WC2. Of course I would go.</p> <p>The atmosphere surrounding Stockhausen had changed a great deal in the intervening years. What we went to see must have been Freitag, and there was little glamour in the Barbican foyer, just a lot of malodorous new-music enthusiasts with their plastic bags full of unperformable manuscripts, muttering to each other. I couldn't tell you what the piece was about: a lot of highly personal mythology about Lucifer, dancers dressed as syringes, instrumental solos, taped children's choruses. The music, as far as I remember, was largely made up of interminable two-part counterpoint between woodwind instruments, devoid of any interest. We left at the interval.</p> <p>After a deep trough of unfashionability, Stockhausen's death seems to have sparked off some serious attempts to come to terms with his immense, confusing legacy. With festivals in Paris and London this autumn attempting to revive the best of his catalogue, we could be facing an Elgar situation, in which late-career neglect is followed by posthumous popular canonisation.</p> <p>What happened to Stockhausen? At his zenith, 40 years ago, his work and presence permeated every corner of the musical world, and beyond. People with no interest in contemporary art music were aware of Stockhausen, in name at least. His works were issued on disc by Deutsche Grammophon as soon as they were written and performed. Far from being a vanity project, DG's Stockhausen discs sold well enough for it to issue two greatest hits LPs. Stockhausen events routinely sold out immense venues; rock musicians took to name-checking the master. Even now, it's rare to read an article about Stockhausen that doesn't refer, awestruck, to the fact that his face appears on the cover of the Beatles' Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.</p> <p>By the time Stockhausen died, last year, rock journalists were about the only ones taking him seriously. Ed Vulliamy, writing in the Observer the day after his death, was in no doubt: \"This was the man who realised that Wagner was rock'n'roll and that rock'n'roll is Wagner ... no Stockhausen, no Pink Floyd, no Stockhausen, no Velvet Underground or Yes, certainly no Brian Eno. Probably no Radiohead either.\"</p> <p>It seems a tragic justification of the career of the author of Gruppen that it would lead, in the end, to a multi-million selling pop album called OK Computer. But such Lilliputian testaments were very much in the air in 2007 because, for the best part of 30 years, the people who understood what had made Stockhausen interesting in the first place were generally not willing to stand up for his whole career. Since the mid-1970s, the composer who had once ruled a vast swath of contemporary taste had turned into a curiosity.</p> <p>Stockhausen scholars are keen to discourage people from dividing his career into a soberly analytical period and a mystical one. Nevertheless, there is a Darmstadt Stockhausen and a Sirius Stockhausen. The first, running from 1950 to the mid-1960s, was exposed at the famous Darmstadt summer school where Pierre Boulez, Luigi Nono and Bruno Maderna first came together. Stockhausen's music of this period is tonally, rather than conceptually, adventurous. Like many of the Darmstadt school, he was interested in \"total serialism\", or the extension of Schoenberg's theories to regions the latter never dreamed of. In addition, there were the first ventures into \"electronic music\": with what now seem very primitive means (razorblades and one-track or, later, four-track tapes), Stockhausen created the first enduring masterpieces of the medium, Gesang der J\u00fcnglinge and Kontakte.</p> <p>These pieces are full of life, colour and dramatic power. I would guess that Gruppen, the intricate and torrential piece for three simultaneous orchestras of 1958, remains his most admired piece by musicians. But if he had remained a Darmstadt figure, he would never have made the cover of Sgt Pepper, and few people would have justified his existence by the popularity of Yes.</p> <p>What occurred - and continued, controversially, until his death - was what might be called the Sirius period. The composer who would declare in the 1970s that he had arrived from the star Sirius (rather than been born in Burg M\u00f6drath, near Cologne, in 1928) actually started to appear in the 1960s. You could even trace the mystical tendency back to his first encounters with John Cage, inviting the American guru of chance procedures and Zen contemplation to speak at Darmstadt in 1958. At first, pieces such as the four-ensemble Carr\u00e9 were intended to alter the sense of the passing of time in listeners' minds; these were followed by idealistic statements of global endeavour, such as Telemusik and Momente. Ideas about the process of performance then started to inflect the work.</p> <p>Stockhausen's exotic appearance and counter-cultural way of life drew much attention in the 1970s, as he trotted about the world with two companions and a number of children. One of the worrying things about Stockhausen's development was how he withdrew from publishers, record companies and ensembles. He preferred to issue his work through his own networks and circles; it isn't difficult to imagine that this removed any kind of nourishing critique from the processes of composition. What critique Stockhausen had, after he withdrew from Darmstadt, was undoubtedly either frivolous or frankly exotic; his first assistant, Cornelius Cardew, detached himself into a position of ludicrous Maoism, and wrote a book with the glorious title Stockhausen Serves Imperialism.</p> <p>Despite its undoubted excesses, the post-1960s period produced some unforgettable spectacles. Stimmung, a 90-minute vocal meditation on the overtones of a bass B flat, never fails to capture an audience's imagination. Inori and Trans, vast and simple sonorous canvases - one with a Japanese priest carrying out adorations on a platform - at first can arouse giggles, but in the end are impressively sustained exercises in pure orchestral grandeur.</p> <p>If some of Stockhausen's middle period requires an audience to suppress impatience or scepticism, the operas from the cycle Licht seem to depend on irritation, embarrassment and bewilderment in the audience to maintain any interest at all. Part of the problem was his decision to make demands an opera house could never meet, with some works having to be premiered in sports halls. Later, we would hear of eccentric ideas such as having each member of a string quartet play in a separate helicopter, connected by intercoms. Viewing the Helicopter Quartet on YouTube reveals some highly jejune musical invention and a spectacular visual concept. But, despite occasional striking inventions, it is hard to conceive of Licht as anything but a vast folly.</p> <p>Stockhausen's reputation sank catastrophically. The point of these festivals is to see what can be rescued from the absurdity in his later work. Everyone knows there is a good deal of solid, adventurous worth. Perhaps an illuminating comparison is with the German artist Joseph Beuys. They were both towering guru figures in their fields, but Beuys saw the absurdity of the guru, the genius, in a postwar Germany. The society he grew up in had had rather too much of authority figures commanding unquestioning respect. Stockhausen never quite accepted that, and the weakness and the foolishness were the product of someone in love with the idea of his own cryptic authority.</p> <p>There are moments of incomparable genius in Stockhausen. Now he is dead, it's up to listeners to pick through the music and discover the moments of startling newness that need neither explanation nor justification. Just listen to the brass chords hurtling round the hall at the climax of Gruppen and ask yourself: does this man need to be sold by the mention of Radiohead?</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Klang</strong>, a Tribute to Karlheinz Stockhausen, is at the Southbank Centre, London SE1, from Saturday to November 9. <a href=\"http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk\">southbankcentre.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>The smartphone landscape is changing rapidly with the arrival of the T-Mobile G1, the first phone based on Google's Android software, and the huge success of Apple's iPhone business. And if both of these take big slices of the smartphone market, that leaves less for everybody else \u2013 unless they can find a way to respond.</p> <p>Research In Motion (RIM) is already in motion: it has spent the past couple of years moving into the consumer market with hot new products such as the BlackBerry Bold and Storm. Nokia, the world's largest phonemaker, has targeted high-end users with the E71, N95 and N96 and similar phones. Nokia has also taken control of the Symbian smartphone operating system and is making that open source as well. Meanwhile, Microsoft has ... done not very much at all. </p> <p>\"We're very confident in our strategy, so I don't think we need a particular response,\" says Alex Reeve, who heads up the Windows Mobile business in the UK. </p> <p>But while Microsoft sold 18m smartphone licences in the year to June, 2m short of its target, Apple says it sold 6.9m iPhones during the last quarter alone. As the iPhone goes global, it's not hard to see it outselling Microsoft's 50+ handset manufacturers combined. It's also not hard to see many of those 50+ handset manufacturers at least trying Android as well.</p> <p>Microsoft is in a tricky position because, like Google, it doesn't make phones. It supplies an operating system that anyone can license, but ultimately it's reliant on partners who may have other ideas. </p> <p>Taiwan's HTC, for example, has been a major manufacturer of Windows Mobile phones, but now it's making G1 Googlephones as well. </p> <p>Windows Mobile can't even rely on its parent, Microsoft to give it a market advantage. Phones running Windows Mobile were the first to offer good synchronisation with Microsoft Exchange, which is the standard corporate email server, and this gave Windows Mobile an advantage in the business market. However, Microsoft has since licensed Exchange sync to rival handset-makers including Palm, Nokia and Apple. </p> <p><strong>Locked market</strong></p> <p>Reeve says: \"We've taken the approach that we want as many people to have access to Exchange as possible. We have absolute confidence in our ability to sell our mobile product without locking people in.\"</p> <p>Of course, Microsoft still has advantages for corporate use. Ken Dulaney at Gartner, the leading analyst covering handhelds and smartphones, points out that all the systems that were designed for warehouse and factory floor use run Windows Mobile. Also, companies can develop their own applications using Microsoft Visual Studio \u2013 which they already use to develop PC applications \u2013 and install those applications however they like. </p> <p>\"We'd never lock people in like the iPhone,\" says Reeve. \"The whole point of a smartphone, in the Microsoft philosophy, is to make it open to applications, so everybody can build the solutions they really want.\"</p> <p>Google's Android software is open-source (it's based on Linux) and free, so it could also challenge Microsoft as an open application platform. But Reeve doesn't think the G1 is a threat. \"It has no integration at all with the enterprise,\" he says, and Google has a \"kill switch\" so it can erase software that you load on the device.</p> <p>According to Dulaney, Microsoft had a choice with Windows Mobile 6: it could either \"defend their enterprise turf against RIM\", or focus on improving the user interface and attack the consumer market where the iPhone was making headway. \"In either case, they were going to suffer,\" says Dulaney. </p> <p>\"I think they chose the right thing, which was to defend the enterprise area, where they're strong,\" he says.</p> <p>Reeve, however, rejects the idea that Microsoft has been slipping in the consumer market. \"We're growing very quickly in that area,\" he says. </p> <p>He points to the HTC Diamond, HTC Touch HD, Samsung Omnia and the Xperia X1 \u2013 Sony Ericsson's first Windows Mobile phone \u2013 as being stylish designs with consumer appeal. A hit product can change everything, at least for a while.</p> <p>Stylish hardware does not necessarily come with stylish software, of course, and Windows Mobile has come in for plenty of criticism. Dulaney says Microsoft has \"different priorities \u2013 a passion for developers\", but lacks Apple's passion for the user interface (UI). \"They just don't have the genes,\" he says.</p> <p><strong>Face to face</strong></p> <p>The hardware suppliers and network operators can do something about that by changing the UI, as Palm has done, or by adding their own interface, as HTC did with TouchFLO. So far, however, nothing has come close to the iPhone. </p> <p>Whether Microsoft will be able to do that with Windows Mobile 7 remains to be seen: Reeve says Microsoft isn't commenting.</p> <p>But in the long run, the real question is whether Microsoft cares. If Windows Mobile sells 20m licences a year at a hypothetical $7 to $8 (\u00a34.50 to \u00a35) each, that's only $140m to $160m, which isn't as much as a decent Xbox 360 game. It's a very long way from the $4.6bn that Apple reckons the iPhone generated in the last quarter alone. </p> <p>Still, Microsoft isn't likely to drop out of the mobile phone market, for two reasons. First, there's value in the way Windows Mobile fits into Microsoft's whole enterprise business, supporting Microsoft Office, Exchange and its Live web sites. Second, Windows Mobile isn't a standalone system, it's just one example of a software stack based on Windows CE, alongside PocketPC and Windows Automotive. CE has been used in thousands of products including set-top boxes, petrol pumps, jukeboxes and even sewing machines. </p> <p>Given the scale of the investment in Windows CE, and Microsoft's ambitions in the consumer electronics area, Microsoft must surely keep it going.</p> <p>What I think we are likely to see, under the Windows not Walls slogan, is Microsoft moving to a broader \"platform play\". Instead of focusing on particular products, Microsoft could present Windows as a more interoperable offering for the 2010s. </p> <p>The platform will have three legs - Windows 7, Windows Mobile 7 and Windows Live - with Live Mesh rings automatically synchronising data as required across all your devices. (If you want to play with Live Mesh, <a href=\"https://www.mesh.com/Welcome/Welcome.aspx\">sign up for the beta</a>.) </p> <p>Applications such as email, messaging and word processing will be available on all devices, and also online at Windows Live, with the two working together. You can take your pick about which you prefer at any given time, because they'll interoperate.</p> <p><strong>In the ring</strong></p> <p>It sounds like a good plan \u2013 but then, so did the Windows CE strategy in the early 1990s. However, even the best plans can fail if the execution isn't up to scratch, and sometimes things just don't work out the way anyone might expect.</p> <p>For example, starting in the late 1990s, Microsoft has spent the thick end of a decade establishing its own mobile platform. It can't have imagined being overtaken by a late entrant such as Apple's iPhone.

  "<p>It is time for fleeting nostalgia. Twenty-five years ago this month the Guardian introduced a special section devoted to computers, the grandparent of Technology Guardian. We had been discussing the idea for nearly 18 months amid doubts about the viability of such a strange, untested project.</p> <p>When finally approved it was called, in caps, Futures Micro Guardian. Tim Radford, our venerable science guru, and I were launch editors.</p> <p>As we were nearing publication time I realised we ought to have a regular IT columnist. But who? My computer reading in those days was Practical Computing. I rang its editor and asked if he would like to write the first column, and when he said yes, I added that maybe he had better write the following two while he was at it. He was called Jack Schofield.</p> <p>I remember the launch well, not least because the first two articles I wrote revealed two principles I still regularly fail to grasp. The first is: never underestimate the amazing pace of technology; and the second is that the most dazzling technology often fails. </p> <p>In the first issue, I interviewed the information technology minister, Kenneth Baker, about his use of the BBC's pioneering computer. It had what were then dizzy specifications, and it could download teletext and send faxes along a phone line. A Conservative government had commendably embraced the machine as a vehicle for change in schools.</p> <p>When I went to his house, it turned out that Baker hadn't got much of a clue about the machine himself, but fortunately his civil service minder had. But the point is, we all underestimated the technology. The choice then \u2013 and it was a difficult choice \u2013 was whether to buy the basic version of the Acorn BBC micro with 16K of memory (yes, that's 16,384 bytes) or the more expensive 32K version. Would we ever really need such a large amount of memory? Today, you can get mobile phones with a gigabyte of storage \u2013 that's 1,073,741,824 bytes. </p> <p>Back then, we had absolutely no idea that mobile phones were looming in our future, let alone how many people would have them; or that something called the World Wide Web would be grafted onto the internet. As for being able to run your own global TV channel from a mobile phone (<a href=\"http://worldtv.com\">worldtv.com</a> in conjunction with <a href=\"http://qik.com\">qik.com</a>), that was beyond fantasy. </p> <p>By contrast a lot of people, including me, were calling for the almost limitless capacity of fibre-optic threads to be laid to the home, something that has still not happened 25 years on.</p> <p>My article in the second issue was an interview with Cy Endfield, the Hollywood film director who had invented the Microwriter and the AgendA, one of the earliest PDAs, beloved of Douglas Adams. Both used chords, a clever way of entering characters using five keys on the device. Your fingers could mimic all the letters of the alphabet and symbols in a way that was surprisingly easy to learn. I fell in love with it and still have it somewhere. But its mission to displace the all-dominant, though technically inefficient, Qwerty keyboard failed, as have numerous other whizzy bits of technology I have since embraced. </p> <p>But hang on. Maybe the Microwriter could re-emerge as a touch-screen application for the iPhone to displace the dodgy keypad, one of the iPhone's few weaknesses. Anyone out there listening?</p> <p>What of the next 25 years? It is easy where we are part of the way up the curve: virtually all of the world's 6.6 billion inhabitants will have a mobile device of some kind, which will take over most of their entertainment and, maybe, work experiences. The web will get smarter, hospital care revolutionised, high-definition virtual worlds inhabited by practically everyone, and so on. But I have no idea what new device or invention will come about. One hopes it will be in the area of sustainable energy sources.</p> <p>Let me stick my neck out. In 25 years, there will be fibre to the home. There.</p> <p><a href=\"http://vic.keegan@theguardian.com\">vic.keegan@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The International Energy Agency yesterday sought to play down a report that it believes global oil production is falling faster than previously thought.</p> <p>The Financial Times said a draft of the IEA's annual world energy outlook calculated world production would fall by 9.1% a year without extra investment. A number of oil-producing countries are reported to be finding it harder to finance new projects because of the recent sharp fall in the oil price.</p> <p>\"The future rate of decline in output from producing oilfields as they mature is the single most important determinant of the amount of new capacity that will need to be built globally to meet demand,\" the FT quoted the draft report as saying, adding that the IEA believed it would require a \"significant increase in future investments just to maintain the current level of production\".</p> <p>The WEO is due to be published next month. Yesterday the IEA said the FT article \"appeared to be based on an early version of a draft from several months ago that was subsequently revised and updated\". It added: \"The numbers in the article can be misleading and should not be quoted or considered to be official IEA results.\"</p> <p>The oil price peaked at $147 a barrel in July but has since slumped to less than half that figure on fears of lower demand. \"I'm seeing a lot of projects being postponed because the finance is no longer there,\" Qatar's oil minister, Abdullah al-Attiyah, told a conference in London this week. </p> <p>Members of Opec plan to invest $160bn in the next few years on projects to expand capacity. \"If prices decline, most of our projects will be either delayed or cancelled,\" said Opec secretary general, Abdullah al-Badri.</p>",
  "<p>So another cooking show, <strong>The Restaurant</strong> (BBC2), reaches its climax. Raymond Blanc has summoned the remaining two pairs to the Eurostar terminal at St Pancras for the final challenge. Or shallonge, as he says, because ee spiks laik Inspecteur Clouseau. He has, delightfully, changed front of house into front erv arse, and earlier in the series, he said a dish lacked hairmf. Hairmf? Oh, oomph!</p> <p>So what is the final shallonge Raymond is sending Michelle'n'Russell and Alasdair'n'James on the Orient Express, to cook for the passengers. Presumably, when the winners are chosen, somewhere between Paris and Istanbul, there'll be a blast on the whistle and the train will enter a tunnel, possibly under the Alps, and it will emerge on the other side to a haunting scream and the discovery of the losing pair with Sabatier knives driven through their hearts. Can Raymond do Poirot too? Because Clouseau would be of no use on the Orient Express ... except that the famous French chef will be the murderer, of course, having dispensed with the pair he doesn't want to go into business with.</p> <p>Anyway, they're not even aboard yet. Oh, and it turns out that the Orient Express doesn't leave from Paris these days, but from London's Victoria Station. So what the hell are they doing at St Pancras? All very mysterious. Still, Raymond has a final tip: \"Rimembeur, zer seurblime inteurests you, not juice zer marely good.\" Actually, the charm of the way he speaks - and the key ingredient to a proper comedy French accent - is not just in the pronunciation but also in the stress. So it is the first syllable of rimembeur that is emphasised: RIMembeur. Beautiful. </p> <p>Russell and Michelle decide that seurblime means poached salmon. That's a bit ordinary for the Orient Express, isn't it, even if it does leave from Victoria? James and Alasdair opt for thermidor, and spend \u00a3300 on 20 lobsters. They obviously don't know that Lidl is doing them at a fiver each. </p> <p>Finally then, when all the food has been prepped, the menus printed and vases of flowers placed on the table, the train pulls out. \"Both couples are unaware Raymond is on board,\" says the narrator. Yeah, right. For a start, he's always surprising them - it would be a much bigger surprise if he wasn't on the train. And also, he's the star, the whole point of this show, so why wouldn't he be on board for the grand finale? </p> <p>Cooking on a train throws up a few problems. It's cramped, and the motion makes Russell's biscuits fall out of the grill. Happily, there is a camera pointing right at them at that very moment - now there's a stroke of luck. Hmm. </p> <p>Raymond makes his surprise appearance, the food is served; some is good, some bad. The soup is delicious, a grapefruit sorbet is a triumph. But the broad-bean risotto is overcooked, and the salmon is uninteresting, just as I predicted. </p> <p>But the biggest disappointment of all is the journey itself. Four hours after leaving London, the train arrives not in Istanbul (that would be pushing it) or even Paris, but in London! The Orient Express goes neither east nor fast, but slowly from Victoria to Victoria. You might as well take the Circle line; it's a lot cheaper. And you could take a picnic, stuffed with \u00a35 Lidl lobsters.</p> <p>I watch TV in advance - they send me DVDs. But because they were worried I might leak the ending to the news desk (who would have obviously ditched the global economic crisis and the US elections and put the winner of The Restaurant on the front page), they sent one without the ending. At the time of writing, I don't know who won and went into business with Raymond, and who got Sabatiered through the heart. </p> <p>To be honest, though, I'm not particularly bothered. The Restaurant is not essential television. It tries very hard to be The Apprentice of food. But the tasks, by their very nature, are less varied. And although I like Raymond, especially the way he speaks, he doesn't have the charisma of Sir Alan. Nor are his spies as good (or as creepy) as Margaret and Nick.</p> <p>Even more importantly, I'm not really learning anything practical from it about food or how to cook it. That's the problem with food on television now - it's become just a competition, with celebrity chefs, winners and losers, dreams fulfilled and dreams broken. Somehow the food itself has been forgotten.</p>",
  "<p>Vodafone is understood to have clinched a strategic partnership with Mobile TeleSystems, the largest mobile phone operator in Russia, as it searches for growth in emerging markets.</p> <p>The deal, which Moscow-based MTS is expected to announce this morning, will see Vodafone sign up MTS as a \"partner network\" to bring a range of Vodafone services into Russia and other countries including Ukraine and Belarus.</p> <p>MTS and its subsidiaries have more than 87 million customers in Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan, out of a total population of more than 230 million.</p> <p>MTS has been listed in New York for the past eight years and is majority-owned by billionaire Vladimir Yevtushenkov's Sistema conglomerate. Vodafone is not expected to take an equity stake in the firm. Neither Vodafone nor MTS would comment on the move.</p> <p>The deal will provide reassurance for western companies who have become concerned about doing business in Russia after the political interference that forced BP into a major restructuring of its BP-TNK joint venture and the Kremlin's incursion into Georgia.</p> <p>In July, Vodafone admitted that some of its core markets such as Spain and the UK were becoming challenging because of the worsening economic climate. The company will announce its half-year results on November 11 and the management is expected to deliver a gloomy prognosis for Vodafone's core European businesses and to announce another round of cost cuts.</p> <p>To try to make up the slack, the company recently restructured its management to focus on emerging markets. It has already made acquisitions in India, Turkey and Ghana and recently strengthened its position in South Africa by acquiring control of the country's largest cellular phone operator, Vodacom. </p> <p>Yesterday, Vodafone announced plans to increase its stake in Poland's telecoms operator Polkomtel by 4.8% to 24.4%, for \u20ac176m (\u00a3140m).</p> <p>It has also made extensive use of partnerships. It has more than 40 network partners across the world and has used them to expand eastwards in Europe. It has partner networks in Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, Serbia, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. Under the terms of these agreements, Vodafone and its partners cooperate in the development of global services under dual brand logos. Services in Russia are expected to be marketed under the MTS-Vodafone logo.</p>",
  "<p>A further \u00a34bn in loans to small and medium-sized firms will be made available today when Alistair Darling and Lord Mandelson announce measures from the European Investment Bank (EIB) to help with the downturn.</p> <p>At Guildhall in London, the bank's president Philippe Maystadt will announce that British banks are entitled to apply for \u00a34bn out of an EU-wide fund of \u00a324bn.</p> <p>Darling and Mandelson will use the occasion to tell bankers that they should resume lending to such firms, and should not increase their business charges.</p> <p>Gordon Brown made clear yesterday that ministers believe the loan facility from the EIB, which follows the government's \u00a3500bn recapitalisation and liquidity deal, means banks have little excuse not to extend credit.</p> <p>He told MPs: \"Having recapitalised the banks, we want to ensure that they will extend availability of credit at competitive prices ... We urge banks not to change the terms and charges for existing lending to small businesses in our country.\"</p> <p>Britain has a 16.2% shareholding in the EIB, but British banks have only taken 10% of its available funds; the EIB is to streamline the process for applying for loans, but Darling will tell the banks they must themselves make more effort to take up such loans.</p> <p>The EIB is the European Union's bank and has an AAA credit rating enabling it to raise funds on the capital market at favourable rates; however, it is a \"demand-driven\" institution, and responds to potential borrowers, in this case British banks, applying for finance. It announced in September it intended to raise its lending by 50% compared with 2007.</p> <p>Darling said last night: \"Small firms are vital to the strength of our economy. We need to make sure that despite the global credit crunch, they have access to the loans and capital they need to help their businesses grow and develop.</p> <p>\"I am delighted by this commitment from the EIB and the banks to get more finance to small firms, and to ensure the funding is more flexible and easier to access than in the past. The government will do everything necessary to support Britain's small firms at this difficult time, so they can get on with the job of growing their businesses and supporting important sectors of our economy.\"</p> <p>The EIB agreed to allocate \u20ac15bn (\u00a312bn) in loans to small and medium-sized firms for 2008-09, after a meeting of EU finance ministers in Nice in September. The bank has been financing such firms since 1968.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Japan </strong></h2> <p>The global financial crisis struck at the heart of corporate Japan yesterday when Sony's quarterly profits dropped by 90% and Toshiba's fell 99%. Sony's operating profit for the second quarter dropped to \u00a511bn (\u00a369m), down from \u00a5111bn last year. Mounting concern about the health of the world economy and the strength of the yen battered sales of products such as digital cameras and flat-screen TVs, mainstays of the recovery mounted under its chairman, Sir Howard Stringer. Sony estimated its annual profit through to the end of March would fall 58% from last year. </p> <h2><strong>Procter &amp; Gamble </strong></h2> <p>P&amp;G, the world's largest consumer goods group, lowered its full-year profit forecasts, blaming a stronger US dollar and high costs for materials. Chairman and chief executive AG Lafley said: \"We're not seeing that commodity recession. You might be seeing it on television, but we're not seeing it in the marketplace,\" he said. P&amp;G, whose products include Pampers nappies, has suffered as consumers switch to low-price brands in some areas, such as batteries, where its Duracell brand lost share . </p> <h2><strong>Botox</strong></h2> <p>Allergan, maker of Botox anti-wrinkle treatment, warned yesterday the economic downturn would lead to lower than expected sales and profit this year. Allergan said third-quarter sales of Botox rose 7% to $318m (\u00a3203m), but analysts said that was about $8m lower than expected.</p> <h2><strong>MGM Mirage </strong></h2> <p>The world's second-largest casino operator, MGM Mirage, said yesterday third-quarter profits fell 67% as business slumped on the Strip. The company, which operates resorts including the Bellagio, Mandalay Bay and Circus Circus in Las Vegas, said income fell to $61.3m, from $183.8m a year earlier. </p> <h2><strong>Steel </strong></h2> <p>Two Asian steelmakers filed weak quarterly results. Nippon Steel, booked a 13% drop in quarterly profit while China's Baosteel, fell short of forecasts in latest quarter and projected losses for the next one.</p>",
  "<p>The International Monetary Fund, the European Union and the World Bank announced a huge rescue package for Hungary yesterday in an attempt to save central Europe's former economic powerhouse from bankruptcy.</p> <p>The $25.1bn (\u00a315.3bn) bail-out, which was much larger than expected, aims to help restore investors' confidence in the country's financial markets and the forint, and marks the first time that an EU member state has been rescued by the IMF.</p> <p>The deal comes with strings attached, with the IMF insisting on austerity measures to curb high public spending.</p> <p>Right-wing politicians said the agreement endangered Hungary's independence and was an attack on its sovereignty, while some experts warned that budget cuts could lead to job losses, exacerbating the already bleak economic situation and increasing the chances of recession.</p> <p>But markets rallied on the news, boosting the forint after weeks in which it has been in freefall, losing 20% of its value. The Polish zloty and Czech koruna also made gains yesterday after what was seen as a message to all of Europe's emerging markets that a network was in place to support them.</p> <p>Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the IMF's managing director, said the loan - \u00a39.6bn from the IMF, \u00a34.96bn from the EU and \u00a3790m from the World Bank - would \"bolster the economy's near-term stability and improve its long-term growth potential.\"</p> <p>The bail-out came as the European commission called for EU emergency funding available for struggling countries to be more than doubled from \u20ac12bn to \u20ac25bn (\u00a319.6bn) by raising money on the markets through bond issues.</p> <p>\"Some member states and neighbours are under stress. We're ready to act,\" said Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, the economic affairs commissioner.</p> <p>The call to more than double the \"balance of payments facility\", used as medium-term loans, is to be put to an emergency EU summit next week, a meeting that is to prepare the ground for the global economic summit in Washington a week later.</p> <p>Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the commission president, said he would publish a more detailed \"EU recovery plan\" by the end of next month. He spoke of re-allocating spending and investments from the EU's six-year \u20ac350bn cohesion funds and of raising the capital base of the European Investment Bank earlier than planned.</p> <p>The commission warned that the meltdown was ballooning into an economic crisis that would cost jobs, hit business and households, and cut European growth \"significantly\" over the next two years.</p> <p>The crisis came as a shock to Hungary, long seen as a solid investor base in former communist Europe where until recently the forint had enjoyed a strong standing because of the country's prospects of adopting the euro. </p> <p>As a result of a strong forint and high interest rates, many Hungarians took out mortgages in foreign currency loans. Hungary's heavy dependence on borrowing from abroad at a time of worldwide economic instability has caused investors to question whether the country's economy could continue to survive.</p> <p>The Hungarian central bank's move to increase interest rates by 3% to 11.5% last week did little to stop the flow of money abroad or to boost the forint, making the bail-out package - the equivalent of a fifth of Hungary's annual economic output - a necessity.</p> <p>Crucially it will now allow the socialist government of Ferenc Gyurcs\u00e1ny to find sufficient funds to finance the 2009 budget. But austerity measures are expected to include a 300bn forint (\u00a3920m) cut in spending that will hit pensioners and civil servants hardest.</p>",

  "<p>Yelena Nekrasova is in shock.

I don't know how I'm going to find another job. I have some savings but they won't last beyond the end of the year.\"</p> <p>The panic that seized Russia during its 1998 financial crisis has yet to take hold, but public confidence is beginning to crumble. On Monday, Ufaleynickel, the country's third-largest nickel producer, announced it would be sacking 400 workers after prices for the metal tumbled. Managers said the exchange price of $8,000 (\u00a35,000) per tonne was less than a third of the cost of producing that quantity at its Urals plant.</p> <p>Russian Copper - controlling 14% of the country's refined copper market - confirmed on the same day that it was freezing all investment projects for 2009 because of falling prices.</p> <p>Moscow restaurants have stopped accepting customers' credit cards and regional governments have begun laying off bureaucrats. After seven years of huge growth on the back of high oil and commodity prices and a brash re-emergence as a great power on the world stage, there are growing signs of weakness in Russia's economy.</p> <p>Stratfor, a risk-forecasting agency, said this week that Russia was experiencing \"a comprehensive flight of foreign capital\" that began after the war in neighbouring Georgia and gathered pace as investors lost faith in Russian company and government bonds.</p> <p>Since August, an estimated $230bn has been wiped off the value of shares held by Russia's oligarchs. Tycoons such as metals magnate Oleg Deripaska, who took on credit with shares as collateral, have been forced to shift assets when banks called in the loans.</p> <p>Russia's Central Bank has been obliged to reintroduce limits on daily currency swaps to prevent speculation on the rapidly depreciating rouble.</p> <p>This week, the Kremlin, which earlier set aside $200bn in loans, tax cuts and other measures to help private companies, was forced to announce a new package of emergency measures.</p> <p>Igor Shuvalov, first deputy prime minister, said the government would help shore up prices in the property sector by buying newly built apartments from construction companies for social housing. The banks would also receive support, he said, adding: \"Rumours that we will support some banks and the others will die, are wrong. We will give a chance to everybody.\"</p> <p>Most Russians have been sheltered from the impact of falling markets because only 3% of the population own shares. But analysts say the middle class could soon be hit hard, with inflation predicted to rise to 13% as the state injects credit into the economy. </p> <p>Job losses are spreading as companies rein in expenditure. \"Seven of my colleagues have been sacked in the last few weeks,\" said Katya, 26, the chief accountant of a trading company in Yekaterinburg, who did not want to give her surname. \"I've had my salary cut by 10,000 roubles (\u00a3227). My boss said he had no choice, the financial crisis has hit our business.\" </p> <p>Observers believe it will be hard for Russia to burn through the reserves it has built up in recent years from soaring oil prices. State funds amount to $650bn, mostly in international capital reserves. So far, Russia has used a small amount of its war chest. But speaking on a four-day trade visit to Moscow, business secretary Lord Mandelson warned on Monday that Russia could be vulnerable to an over-reliance on high prices for hydrocarbons. \"The Russians are acting decisively and with considerable reserves,\" he said. \"[But] if the oil price and the price for metals were to fall substantially those reserves would also shrink and their room for manoeuvre would be tighter.\"</p>",

  "<p>The Royal Society has announced plans today to study which planetary-scale geo-engineering techniques might play a practical role in stemming the worst impacts of climate change. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/01/climatechange.endangeredhabitats\">Geo-engineering </a> includes everything from placing mirrors in space that reflect sunlight from the Earth to seeding the oceans with iron to encourage the growth of algae that can soak up atmospheric carbon dioxide. The Royal Society study will look at which techniques might be feasible to carry out and what their impacts or unintended consequences might be on society.</p> <p>\"Some of these proposals seem fantastical, and may prove to be so. Our study aims to separate the science from the science fiction and offer recommendations on which options deserve serious consideration,\" said John Shepherd, an oceanographer at Southampton University, and chair of the Royal Society working group that will carry out the study. \"We need to investigate if any of these schemes could help us avoid the most dangerous changes to our climate and to fully understand what other impacts they may have.\"</p> <p>In September, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/01/climatechange.scienceofclimatechange2\">the Royal Society</a> published a special edition of its journal, Philosophical Transactions, dedicated to geo-engineering. In their introduction to the papers in that edition, Brian Launder of the University of Manchester and Michael Thompson of the University of Cambridge wrote: \"While such geo-scale interventions may be risky, the time may well come when they are accepted as less risky than doing nothing. There is increasingly the sense that governments are failing to come to grips with the urgency of setting in place measures that will assuredly lead to our planet reaching a safe equilibrium.\"</p> <p>In the papers, experts said that a reluctance \"at virtually all levels\" to address rising greenhouse gas emissions meant carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere were on track to pass 650 parts per million (ppm), which could bring an average global temperature rise of 4C. They called for more research on geo-engineering options to cool the Earth.</p> <p>But not everyone is convinced of the need for such radical techniques to halt climate change. Greenpeace chief scientist Doug Parr said: \"The wider point is not the pros and cons of particular technologies, but that the scientific community is becoming so scared of our collective inability to tackle climate emissions that such outlandish schemes are being considered for serious study. We already have the technology and know-how to make dramatic cuts in global emissions - but it's not happening, and those closest to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/01/climatechange.scienceofclimatechange1\">climate science</a> are coming near to pressing the panic button.\" </p> <p>Shepherd said that, whatever his study finds, the world cannot ignore the need to cut carbon emissions anyway. \"Whatever solutions technology may offer us in the future, it's clear that the need to cut emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere is now more urgent than ever.\"</p> <p>The working group's report is expected to be published next year.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor\">Bank of England</a> failed to respond to warning signs of a looming recession and had been wrong to delay cutting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/interestrates\">interest rates</a> until too late to stop growth contracting and unemployment rising sharply, a member of the Bank's monetary policy committee (MPC) said last night.</p> <p>Speaking as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/30/interest-rates-us-economy\">US Federal Reserve cut interest rates to just 1%</a> in an attempt to halt a slump in activity, David Blanchflower launched an outspoken attack on his eight MPC colleagues, saying the Bank had been too optimistic about the UK's ability to survive the global crisis, and Britain would now endure 18 months of falling output as it felt the full impact.</p> <p>The Bank is expected to follow the Fed's lead by cutting at least half a percentage point off UK rates next week, although some analysts want a one point cut after news the economy shrank by 0.5% in the third quarter of this year.</p> <p>Blanchflower's intervention came as David Cameron attempted to pile the pressure on Gordon Brown when the Tory leader challenged the prime minister to admit that his fiscal rules were now dead and he was planning a \"spending splurge\".In their most bruising encounter in the crisis, Brown hit back at prime minister's questions by accusing the Tories of mixed messages, saying in one breath that it was right to increase borrowing in a recession and saying in another that it was not.</p> <p>Cameron asked of the fiscal rules: \"Why will he not now admit that they are dead? Let us just remember them - he used to be so proud of them. Rule one was: 'Only borrow to invest'; now he is having to borrow to pay for unemployment benefit. That rule is dead. Rule two was: 'Don't have debt over 40% of national income.' Even on his own fiddled figures, that rule is now dead. Why will he not admit that the rules failed to deliver responsibility in the good years and that, as soon as the bad times came, they collapsed completely?\"</p> <p>In a speech last night, chancellor Alistair Darling said it would be \"perverse\" to stick rigidly to the rules during a downturn.</p> <p>Blanchflower was a lone voice on the MPC calling for cuts in interest rates this summer. Speaking in Canterbury last night he criticised fellow MPC members for ignoring his warnings. \"I believe the trend has been apparent for some time. The synchronised downturn in so many surveys should have led us to realise sooner that the UK economy was entering a recession,\" he said.</p> <p>\"If rates are not cut aggressively [when the MPC meets next week] we do face the prospect of a relatively deep and long-lasting recession.\"</p> <p>In his speech, he said tighter credit conditions imposed by banks had yet to be fully felt. Policymakers faced an \"unusually severe\" international financial problem, possibly more significant than 1929, a crash which principally involved bank failures in the US. \"The current difficulties in financial markets are more comparable to what happened in world war one, when stock exchanges in several countries closed for extended periods.\"</p> <p>The MPC had been reluctant to cut rates during the summer as inflation rose to a 16-year-high of 5.2% in September.</p> <p>Blanchflower said the MPC had over-reacted to the threat of higher imported oil and food prices repeating the 1970s inflationary spiral. But workers' bargaining power was weaker now, with little chance that they could push up wages in response to rising prices.</p> <p>\"In its last health check on the economy, released in August, the Bank said it expected output to be flat over the coming year, with employment falling a little. Output growth was expected to recover in 2009 as energy prices fell, the credit crunch eased and a weaker pound helped exports. This was an optimistic view,\" Blanchflower said. \"Clearly output is now beginning to contract, but I think this likelihood was apparent in August.\"</p> <p>He added that at last month's MPC meeting some had argued for higher borrowing costs. \"I was alone in voting for an immediate cut of half a percentage point. I am concerned about the detrimental effect of recent events in financial markets on the UK economy,\" he said, adding that the 0.5% drop in GDP had occurred mainly before this autumn's market meltdown.</p>",
  "<p>\"Our mission is to change the world by spreading the knowledge of innovators,\" says the publisher Tim O'Reilly with typical northern California enthusiasm. \"I always put my faith in the hackers,\" he smiles. </p> <p>O'Reilly Media is synonymous with high-quality technical reference. It's not as dry as it sounds: it releases an impressive number of books and manuals a year, ranging from tech to travel, and the 54-year old so-called meme-peddler from Sebastopol, CA, has become the guru of technologists around the world. His successful balance of content and spin - and his ability to spot the communities that have crossover potential - means that he has become both spiritual father to alpha geeks worldwide and translator to the masses. Most people associate him with devising the \"iterate and iterate often\" manifesto of the web 2.0 philosophy, but that notch is just one of the web revolutions on his bedpost. </p> <p><strong>Vibrant hackers</strong></p> <p>Last week, his enthusiasm drew a vibrant community of hackers from across Europe to the first non-US O'Reilly Web 2.0 Expo in Berlin. The cosmopolitan capital's bullish optimism, reflected in the glass buildings of the new skyscrapers at Potsdamer Platz and the influx of creatives seeking cool and chic at affordable prices, is attractive to a community that itself was in the doldrums less than a decade ago. </p> <p>\"Our corporate mission for 2003 was to reignite enthusiasm in the computer industry,\" O'Reilly offers. \"Everyone was in the dumps after the dotcom bust, and we wanted to tell a story that made people see how much was actually still going on.\" The aim was to market the web rather than the books, and so its first release, The Whole Internet User's Guide and Manual, came with a free copy of the internet. \"We started the Global Network Navigator, the first commercial website, as a way of promoting the net.\" A few years later, he worked with another community to establish the open-source movement, again to promote his products.</p> <p>O'Reilly's latest contribution to the lexicon of the internet has captured the imaginations of creative, corporate and governmental industries. \"Web 2.0\" is a buzzword for the new medium, a constantly updating feedback system evolving at the speed of light. It's become the must-do-or-die killer app that's inspired a social media gold rush that many in the traditional corporate world admit they don't have a grip on. </p> <p>The biggest stumbling block, and that which O'Reilly is trying to overcome on his latest speaking tour, is that both the consumer and the company must sacrifice their control in order to succeed with web 2.0. For enterprise, this means accepting negative PR rather than controlling the brand image. For the customer, this means losing control of more and more personal data in order to get the most out of a service. O'Reilly is keen to point out the positives to both parties. He uses the example of Wasabi, which uses credit card data to identify consumer trends for social recommendations: \"Every swipe of a credit card is a vote. If you go to a restaurant once and never come back, it doesn't really tell you anything. But if your credit card data says that you go back two, three or four times, that tells you something about that restaurant that's way more powerful than you might get with an explicit review.\"</p> <p><strong>Got your number</strong></p> <p>While enthusiastic, his spin doesn't address the potential privacy infringements that leave many consumer rights activists concerned. He parries that blow: \"With web 2.0, how the application is using your personal data is front and centre in the interface versus something that's hidden behind the closed doors of your bank, where they figure out whether or not they'll give you a loan based on the results of the obscure algorithms that only they know,\" he argues. \"Because it's consumer-focused, the customer can see what's going on, can control it, can respond to it and can opt out.\"</p> <p>This assumes that the customer recognises that the data is being extracted and used, and is able realistically to assess its long-term value in light of the immediate benefits that are on offer. As others have noted, this isn't always the case, particularly when using opt-out paradigms. But O'Reilly is optimistic that attitudes towards data ownership will change. To him, evidence points to what consumers will do in future: \"When the Facebook feed was first launched, there was a lot of backlash about that from a privacy point of view. But that kind of lifestreaming now is a whole industry. People adjusted.\" </p> <p>He doesn't offer any more on how people adjust, or what implications there may be. He's focused on the bright lights of a technological future, and he will be guiding the way. \"Peddling a meme is really about helping people to see what's possible,\" he says. And for O'Reilly, to do it successfully means adding value where he sees something that really matters. He'll think about the cost later.</p>",
  "<p>It sounds too good to be true. A human rights campaigner, who bears the injuries of the torture he received in jail, topples Asia's longest-serving despot in a democratic election. But it has just happened in the tropical Indian Ocean archipelago of the Maldives. The election of Mohamed \"Anni\" Nasheed, a former Amnesty International prisoner of conscience, had people dancing in the streets of the island's capital, Mal\u00e9, yesterday. The president-elect said he would not pursue criminal charges against Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, the strongman he defeated, but would instead arrange a pension and security for him. This is a good start, but the charismatic former opposition leader will soon face other tests. The five opposition parties that Nasheed united includes everyone from democrats to conservative Islamic parties, and unity will be difficult to maintain as elections approach for a new parliament in March. Nasheed campaigned for a stronger parliament with the ability to check presidential powers and block appointments to the cabinet. As president, it will be up to him to make this system work. Autocracy brought wealth to the atolls but also glaring inequalities. Nearly a third of children are malnourished and the archipelago has a big drug problem. It also faces rising sea levels. The IMF is urging a cut in public spending and Nasheed inherits an economy which earns 28% of its income from tourism, a sure casualty of the global downturn. His honeymoon will not last long.</p>",
  "<p>The US Federal Reserve last night led the way in a series of interest rate cuts aimed at heading off a deep and prolonged global recession when it reduced borrowing costs to 1%.</p> <p>In a move that is expected to be followed by the Bank of Japan tomorrow, and the European Central Bank and the Bank of England next week, America's central bank said the half-point cut in its overnight lending rate was the response to a fresh slump triggered by the recent market turmoil.</p> <p>Alistair Darling last night hinted that the Bank of England could cut rates next week while insisting that it was right for the government to allow the budget deficit to rise during a recession. After fierce exchanges between Gordon Brown and David Cameron in the Commons, the chancellor said it would be \"perverse\" to stick rigidly to the Treasury's fiscal rules during a severe global downturn.</p> <p>The Fed's announcement came at the end of a two-day rally on global stockmarkets, which saw the third-biggest jump in the index measuring London's blue-chip shares. The FTSE 100 closed 316.2 points higher at 4242.5, a rise of 8% that added \u00a376bn to the value of leading stocks. The rally eased the pressure on sterling, which ended trading in London up by more than 2% against the dollar at just over $1.63 after a fall of 9% last week.</p> <p>Tuesday's second-biggest ever rise in share prices on Wall Street prompted a 7.7% jump in the Tokyo market followed by hefty increases on European bourses.</p> <p>In its statement explaining its unanimous decision, the Fed said: \"The pace of economic activity appears to have slowed markedly, owing importantly to a decline in consumer expenditures. Business equipment spending and industrial production have weakened in recent months, and slowing economic activity in many foreign economies is damping the prospects for US exports. Moreover, the intensification of financial market turmoil is likely to exert additional restraint on spending, partly by further reducing the ability of households and businesses to obtain credit.\"</p> <p>Last night's cut in the Fed funds rate took it back to the level under Alan Greenspan after the dotcom bubble burst in 2000, but the US central bank hinted last night that borrowing costs could go still lower. \"Recent policy actions, including today's rate reduction, coordinated interest rate cuts by central banks, extraordinary liquidity measures, and official steps to strengthen financial systems, should help over time to improve credit conditions and promote a return to moderate economic growth,\" it said. \"Nevertheless, downside risks to growth remain.\"</p> <p>The chancellor used the annual Mais Lecture to argue that government policy needed to adapt to changing market conditions . \"These are extraordinary times,\" he said. \"The economy is facing unprecedented global shocks and we need a new approach that is fit for these new times.\"</p> <p>Darling insisted that the government's relaxation of fiscal discipline would be temporary, and next month's pre-budget report would outline plans to bring borrowing and debt back to a sustainable level. \"To increase borrowing in a downturn is sensible - to support people and businesses across the economy,\" Darling said. \"It is right to put money back into the economy when the private sector can't.</p> <p>\"To apply the fiscal rules in a rigid manner today would be perverse. </p> <p>We would have to take money out of the economy, exacerbating an already difficult situation.\"</p> <p>Cameron attempted to pile the pressure on Brown over the downturn when he challenged him to admit that his fiscal rules were now dead and he was planning to embark on a \"spending splurge\".</p> <p>In their most bruising encounter in the financial crisis, the prime minister hit back by accusing the Tories of sending mixed messages, saying with one breath that it was right to increase borrowing in a recession and in another breath saying that it was the wrong thing to do.</p> <p>Cameron said: \"Why will he not now admit that they are dead? Let us just remember them - he used to be so proud of them. Rule one was: 'Only borrow to invest\"; now he is having to borrow to pay for unemployment benefit. That rule is dead. Rule two was: 'Don't have debt over 40% of national income.' Even on his own fiddled figures, that rule is now dead. Why will he not admit that the rules failed to deliver responsibility in the good years and that, as soon as the bad times came, they collapsed completely?\"</p> <p>The prime minister sought to draw a distinction between Cameron's comment last week that automatic fiscal stabilisers inevitably kick in during a recession and yesterday's Daily Telegraph article by the shadow chancellor, George Osborne, in which he said the government was forced into extra borrowing because Brown failed to set aside money during the upturn.</p> <p>Brown said: \"We have to spend in a way that takes us through this economic crisis. If he does not understand what he said a few days ago, perhaps his meetings with the shadow chancellor during the past few days have not been about economics at all.\"</p>",
  "<p>\"Human nature often dictates the need to find someone or something to blame.\" Thus spake Daniel Levy in his letter to the Corinthians ... I do beg your pardon, in his letter to Spurs fans at the weekend. Whether or not you nurse minuscule differences of opinion with Mr Levy over his many stratagems and sermons, you must agree that this missive was a classic of the open letter genre.</p> <p>For too long this much underrated literary device has been the preserve of self-effacing journalists whose weakness for filling space in newspapers with portentous missives beginning \"Dear George Bush\" or \"An open letter to Ben Bernanke\" is a cause for mirth for the rest of us. What a pleasure, then, to find the open letter device increasingly resorted to by football club chairmen who have made monumental arses of themselves, usually via the old \"director of football\" banana skin.</p> <p>October is not yet out and already we have seen open letters deployed by the Newcastle chairman, Mike Ashley, whose director of football is the much-loved Dennis Wise and whose manager is the heavily charm-schooled Joe Kinnear. For all that he has a talent for pulling in the big hitters, Mr Ashley was last month moved to announce that he loved the club so much that he was going to sell it, at least at such time as he could be sure of making a profit, a date we might - in light of recent events in the global financial markets - place around 2019. And on Saturday it was Mr Levy's turn to unleash his open letter, as the Spurs chairman attempted to draw a line under recent and indeed not so recent disappointments for the club, by appealing to fans direct.</p> <p>We have yet to hear from West Ham's chairman, Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson, who would complete our trifecta of chairmen whose employment of a director of football locks them into the inevitability of having to pen an \"open letter\" down the line, typically after the departure of a manager. Like his club's most newshounded supporter, my Guardian colleague Russell Brand, Mr Gudmundsson seems content to remain tight-lipped at present, despite Alan Curbishley having left Upton Park last month. Understandable, perhaps, given that Mr Gudmundsson has been deposed as chairman of an Icelandic bank and threatened with anti-terror legislation by Gordon Brown. (Mr Brown has moved on to branding Mr Brand a terror, but we mustn't digress.)</p> <p>What the open letter effectively does is allow the writers to nurse the illusion of communicating directly with an audience they have either lost or whose secretary's secretary never even took their calls. Yet just as there is a certain absurdity to journalists filling their spaces with open letters to the United States president, or the chairman of the Federal Reserve, so it is to be hoped that, the minute football chairmen have to resort to penning open letters to fans, they realise it is they themselves who have terminally lost the audience. There may be better results around the corner, there may even be a little light silverware in the future, but they will never fully recover and the minute things go even slightly wrong again they will once again be the target of their fans' ire.</p> <p>In his open letter, Mr Levy did make rather weaselly reference to his postbag. \"I do appreciate the time people take to write to me,\" he claimed, \"and when the emails or letters are constructive and not abusive, I can assure you that I read as many as I can. And I do take notice of your views.\"</p> <p>Well, you don't, old chap. At least not inside of several years. But what's the point in getting worked up, when Mr Levy has ushered in a new era where everything you thought you knew was right, and directors of football will have to retrain in other profoundly destabilising cultural roles - as investment bankers, possibly, or as judgment-challenged radio producers?</p> <p>All of which brings us back to Russell, whose suspension yesterday by the BBC leaves his column - in this very space on Saturday - his only outlet. It is very much to be hoped that he might fall back upon the open letter format, perhaps beginning his column \"Dear Andrew Sachs\" or \"Dear Andrews Sachs's granddaughter\" or indeed \"Dear Paul Dacre\".</p> <p>Come to that, as a sublimely gifted ironist, Russell may instead see the comedic potential in addressing an open letter to Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson, advising him that he has lost a significant part of his audience and must stop acting like such an arrogant arse at once.</p>",
  "<p>The Royal Society has never suggested that the world should attempt large-scale climate geoengineering schemes as a \"fix\" for climate change (Leaders, October 29). None of these technologies will provide a \"get out of jail free card\", and they must not divert attention away from national or international efforts to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.</p> <p>However, the scale of the challenge we face in avoiding the worst impacts of climate change means that we need to look at all potential options and assess what their contributions might be.</p> <p>This is why the Royal Society is launching a major study today, looking at whether any of these geoengineering technologies could be feasible or effective. It will also consider what environmental and social impacts they may have and any other possible unintended consequences. Some of the proposed schemes may prove to be as implausible as they seem, others may be ambitious but have potential. We must distinguish between the two and provide policymakers with sound, independent scientific advice, so they can make informed decisions based on fact, not fantasy. <br><strong>Martin Rees </strong><br>President, Royal Society</p> <p>A gaping hole remains in the climate change bill despite the likely inclusion of emissions from aviation and shipping (Minister bows to calls on climate change bill, October 27). The government will still be able to buy \"carbon credits\" from abroad rather than taking action to reduce pollution at home. If the bill is to be more than an accounting fiddle, the Conservative party, in particular, must back our lobbying to plug this loophole. <br><strong>Ruth Davies</strong><br>Head of climate change policy, RSPB</p> <p>There is no credible evidence that algae photosynthesise faster, or are currently able to accumulate substantially more biomass, during a period of sustained growth than other green organisms (How algae could drive the future of biofuels, October 23). Intensive agriculture of any sort rarely uses less fossil fuel energy than the light energy that it conserves as biomass. Biofuels do not lead to any appreciable sparing of carbon dioxide emissions that could not be better accomplished by the most modest means of energy conservation, such as a small reduction of the legal speed limit on motorways. <br><strong>David Walker</strong><br>Emeritus professor, University of Sheffield</p> <p>Our political masters cannot be so ignorant or badly advised as to really believe that the widespread introduction of electric vehicles will cut greenhouse gas emissions (Report, October 28). At least one government scientific adviser must have pointed out that the electricity for charging batteries is currently produced mostly by coal- and gas-fired power stations. These have a lower efficiency than a modern internal combustion engine, plus account has to be taken of transmission, charging etc. Consequently, the amount of greenhouse gases produced would be likely to increase as a result of a move to electric propulsion. </p> <p>It is not worth considering the large-scale introduction of (non-hybrid) electric vehicles until a major proportion of our electricity is generated from genuinely renewable sources. Advisers must also have pointed out that the new technology batteries use rare and valuable metals, such as nickel and lithium. Furthermore, the apparent cheapness of electric propulsion is illusory; it comes about simply because electricity does not currently attract the tax applied to other road fuels.<br><strong>Richard Barnard</strong><br>Visiting fellow, University of Hertfordshire</p> <p>Your article repeats the mantra that the biggest obstacle to electric cars is the lack of a power infrastructure. There must be countless motorists, like me, who find the vast majority of their journeys are short hops. The only infrastructure I need is a socket on the garage wall. Moreover, I have just read that a new battery/capacitor combination has overcome the main disadvantage of lead-acid batteries by making it possible to recharge them without radically shortening their life. What stands in the way of the electric car is the failure of manufacturers to make small electric cars (the G-Wiz costs over \u00a38,000 without VAT) that are in any way comparable to a typical small petrol car in terms of price and performance. <strong><br>Martyn Stevens<br></strong>Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire</p>",
  "<p>We've got so used to the idea, it's easy to discount it. But if Barack Obama is elected US president on Tuesday, the symbolic impact at least can hardly be overestimated. Most obvious is the racial dimension. The election of an African-American to the most powerful job in the world by a society built on slavery, discrimination and ethnic cleansing cannot but have far-reaching cultural repercussions, both in America and across the globe. Throughout the US, it will surely be a moment of catharsis in a country barely a generation away from the struggle over segregation and civil rights. </p> <p>Then there will be profound national and global relief at the end of the eight-year reign of the Bushite Republicans, with their wars of bloody conquest, kidnapping and torture, and reckless featherbedding of the corporate oligarchy at the expense of ordinary Americans. This week's attack on yet another sovereign state, Syria, is a reminder, if any were needed, of the swaggering militarism which has marked the Bush-Cheney regime. </p> <p>Add to that the charismatic appeal of a Kennedy-style liberal, and the ingredients for an outpouring of popular enthusiasm at home and an extended political honeymoon abroad are all in place. In the wake of seven disastrous years of the war on terror, the US political system will be seen to have renewed itself and earned a generous measure of international goodwill towards the latest holder of that bogus, unelected title, \"leader of the free world\".</p> <p>If, on the other hand, John McCain were to confound weeks of opinion polls and win the day, the backlash would surely be harsh. Against a background of intense Republican unpopularity, economic crisis and apparently impregnable polling leads, such a victory would be widely seen as the product of shameless racism - and the election as rigged and stolen. In the US, anger could be expected to turn to rioting. Across the rest of the world, America's popularity and moral standing - already at a historic low - would sink to unprecedented depths. No wonder such a large part of the American establishment is rooting for an Obama win.</p> <p>No politician, least of all one tied up by the constraints of the corporate-funded US presidential system, can hope to meet the kind of expectations that have been aroused among the Illinois senator's armies of enthusiasts, even if bolstered by a clean Democratic sweep in Congress. Political momentum can be sustained in the short term by emblematic decisions, such as the closure of the Guant\u00e1namo Bay internment camp and a start to the withdrawal of troops from Iraq. But it is the economic crisis that has powered Obama's campaign to this point, and despite a more populist agenda than Bill Clinton - including tax rises for those earning more than $250,000, Gordon Brown please note - the sort of measures needed to tackle ballooning unemployment, bankruptcies and repossessions are simply not on the table.</p> <p>This is a country, after all, where real incomes for low and middle income earners have already been stagnating for years, 45 million people have no health insurance, black people make up nearly 40% of its world-beating 2.3 million prison population - and which, on the brink of a slump, is stuffing the pockets of bankers with $700bn without serious public controls. Obama's policy programme, as far as it goes, hardly begins to match the scale of the challenge, but already he is talking about cutting back planned programmes to pay for the crisis and the cost of the Iraq war.</p> <p>The same goes for US foreign policy. After two terms of unilateralism and aggression, Obama's conciliatory tone, opposition to the Iraq war, support for dialogue with Iran, and apparent preference for \"soft power\" naturally seem like manna from heaven in the rest of the world. But look at the small print and continuity, rather than change, appears to be the order of the day. In Iraq, his proposal to withdraw combat troops in 16 months while maintaining bases and \"counter-terror\" forces is increasingly similar to Bush and McCain's own policy, as are his plans to escalate the war in Afghanistan and Pakistan as the \"central front in the war on terror\", and his hawkish line on conflicts from Colombia to Georgia. </p> <p>So far there's no prospect of any fundamental shift in approach, as underlined by the number of Obama's advisers drafted in from the Clinton era. What he appears to be offering instead is some kind of imperialism with a human face - as he himself says, he wants a return to the \"realistic policy\" of George Bush senior, JFK, and \"in some ways, Ronald Reagan\". Some Obama supporters believe much of this is election positioning, and there have been quiet assurances to sympathisers around the world that plenty will be up for discussion in the aftermath of victory.</p> <p>Of course, whoever the president, the US will remain a global colossus, with a military presence in 130 of the world's 195 countries. But it is also a power in unmistakable relative decline and an Obama presidency offers the US a breathing space to re-order its relations with the rest of the world accordingly. The benefit of the doubt that will be given to Obama in the early period of a new administration - in Europe that's likely to stretch to defence of the indefensible, as in the Clinton years - potentially gives the US extra room for manoeuvre. Economic failure may yet force military cutbacks, despite Obama's pledge to expand the armed forces. But, as in the domestic arena, if expectations of change are dashed, the reaction may end up being all the sharper.</p> <p>What seems certain is that Obama's election will be a catalyst that creates political opportunities both at home and abroad. The Obama campaign grew out of popular opposition to the Iraq war and its success has been based on the mobilisation of supporters who will certainly want to go further and faster than their candidate. Economic conditions are also likely to demand a more decisive response. And even if conditions are very different from those which led to the New Deal of the 1930s - not least the lack of a powerful labour movement - Obama could yet, like Roosevelt, be propelled by events to adopt more radical positions. In any case, if Obama is to begin to fulfil the confidence invested in him, hope will not be enough - those who want real change will have to fight for it.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:s.milne@theguardian.com\">s.milne@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Robert Karlsson may not have done enough for a place in the pantheon of great Europeans but there is time yet. The Swede, one of the few members of Nick Faldo's Ryder Cup side to emerge with his reputation enhanced after last month's defeat against the United States at Valhalla, will tee off today in the 21st, and final, Volvo Masters at Valderrama poised to add his name to the roll call of Order of Merit winners.</p> <p>The big Swede will take home the Harry Vardon trophy if he wins on Sunday afternoon. He will win it, too, according to the number crunchers, if he finishes second or if his closest challengers, Padraig Harrington and Lee Westwood, do not take home the \u20ac708,000 (\u00a3557,000) winner's cheque. Deep in the arithmetical undergrowth lies Miguel Angel Jim\u00e9nez, currently fourth in the Order of Merit standings, who has a slim chance of securing a victory that would be popular with the home crowd.</p> <p>These various permutations (see below) add up to a typically complicated set-up for the final event of the 2008 European Tour season. They also add up to one of the most nerve-racking weeks of Karlsson's career.</p> <p>Once upon a time the Swede had a reputation for shakiness in the face of such pressure but no more, as Westwood was more than happy to testify yesterday. \"Robert's stature in the game has changed over the last 18 months to two years,\" said the Englishman. \"He is more widely regarded as a contender in the major championships. Before, we all knew he was a good player but now you look at him and you figure at the end of the week he is going to be there or thereabouts.\"</p> <p>These were warm words from a man who spreads his compliments as frugally as a miser might spread his wealth. Needless to say, Karlsson was flattered, although he was not about to get carried away with himself or with the significance of winning the Order of Merit.</p> <p>\"It is a funny thing because so much of it depends on how many tournaments you play,\" he said. \"Padraig has played something like 12 events and I have played something like 23, so it's a bit unfair. It is a bit like Manchester United playing Arsenal, and one has to play 12 matches and the other 23. It is not really a fair judgment of the season. But if I win it, I'm not going to complain.\"</p> <p>Nor should he. The global spread of the game and the preference for Europeans to play increasingly in the States, has devalued the Order of Merit in recent years but the list of past winners doubles as a who's who of the modern European game. All the greats are on it - from Ballesteros to Faldo, Langer, Woosnam and Lyle - and anyone with affection and respect for those players would be rightfully proud to see his name in such company.</p> <p>Next year will see this tournament usurped as the finale of the European Tour by the Dubai World Championship, with its $10m (\u00a36.12m) prize fund, not to mention another $10m bonus pot.</p> <p>There is a palpable sense this week that the Tour is moving into a new era, just as there is obvious relief among the players that they will no longer have to face the brutal challenge presented by the Valderrama course.</p> <p>\"If anyone feels like they are playing well on that golf course I want to talk to them,\" said Justin Rose. Alas for the Englishman he will not have anyone to talk to during the first round.
