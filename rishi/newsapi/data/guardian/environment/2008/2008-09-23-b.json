  "<p>Ever since the Premier League boomed into life in 1992, fuelled by Sky's millions, stubborn prophets of doom have warned it is a bubble that is bound to burst. More measured observers wondered if clubs would be particularly vulnerable to a recession, because in order to pay enormous wages to their blessed players they rely on millions of ordinary people paying \u00a3400 a year for their Sky packages, season tickets which have ballooned about 800% in 16 years, and sponsorship and corporate entertainment budgets which many companies have to cut in rocky times.</p> <p>Now, here it is: banking meltdown, and the prospect of a recession for which the outlook varies only in the depth of its grimness. But look at the attendances: the football public's response to last week's dire headlines gave a clue to how the game is likely to fare - at the top, clubs believe, perhaps surprisingly, that they will be safe, while lower down, they will have to be careful. </p> <p>At six of the 10 weekend Premier League matches there were capacity or almost full houses. These came at Chelsea, for Manchester United's highly charged visit, Liverpool, West Ham, Tottenham Hotspur and newly promoted Hull City and West Bromwich Albion. Sunderland did not fill the 49,000 Stadium of Light seats but 38,388 people at a match against Middlesbrough hardly represents an exodus of fans in hard-pressed Wearside. Bolton Wanderers, with 6,000 seats empty despite Arsenal's presence, illustrated the continuing struggle to raise Reebok crowds above 22,000, and Blackburn Rovers' kids-for-a-quid deal for the game against Fulham helped to draw 19,398. That is 12,000 below Ewood Park's capacity but Rovers' chairman, John Williams, argues that 20,000 attendees in a town of 100,000 people demonstrates profound commitment, rather than a game losing its lustre.</p> <p>The most spectacular statement of optimism in the Premier League's future was delivered in Manchester, where City's 6-0 rampage against Portsmouth followed the takeover of the club by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan. He issued a public letter headed \"Dear fellow Manchester City fans\", in which he pledged to be a \"long-term investor\", to nurture homegrown players \"not just a team of all-stars\" and to support City's role \"in Manchester and the community it represents\".</p> <p>The letter did not offer just warm words. \"In cold business terms,\" it said, \"Premiership football is one of the best entertainment products in the world and we see this as a sound business investment.\"</p> <p>That could hardly be clearer: Sheikh Mansour, of the Abu Dhabi royal family and chairman of the emirate's International Petroleum Investment Company, does not see the Premier League as a bubble about to burst any time soon.</p> <p>Despite City suddenly becoming the world's richest club and featuring Robinho in the line-up, there were still more than 7,000 empty seats at the City of Manchester Stadium for Sunday's match, which was not broadcast on live TV. For all the petro-billions behind City, \"Manchester and the community it represents\" comprises some of the UK's poorest people. Although 40,000 is, historically, a good crowd, City remain in the category of clubs needing to work to fill their ground. </p> <p>Across Manchester, last week's bail-out of the stricken insurers AIG, United's \u00a314.125m-a-year shirt sponsor, was read by some as a powerful sign of the downturn hitting football, but United sent out a \"business as usual\" message. The club did not argue with marketing analysts who said United would easily find another sponsor if AIG did pull out, because a Manchester United footballer's chest represents a glittering, global shop window for any company, even in this market.</p> <p>Many have noted the melting away of United's season-ticket waiting list following the expansion of Old Trafford and serial price increases, but crowds so far, 75,512 against Newcastle and 74,944 for the Champions League tie with Villarreal, remain immense, up with the record numbers famously packed in cheaply during any previous \"golden age\". </p> <p>All the other boxes are ticked at Old Trafford, including the corporate ones, which, according to a club spokesman, are 96% full for this season. In short, they are not worrying about a meltdown. At the other top clubs, Arsenal and Liverpool still have waiting lists for season tickets, and Chelsea, with adult prices this season between \u00a3650 and \u00a31,150, are also sold out.</p> <p>Dan Jones, of the sports business group at Deloitte, believes Premier League football is less vulnerable than other industries, because of fans' enduring loyalty, and because much of the clubs' money is already secured. The record \u00a32.7bn TV deal runs till 2010 and the clubs are confident that Sky's competitors, for Sheikh Mansour's coveted \"entertainment product\", will trump that figure next time. </p> <p>\"Season tickets are paid up until May, sponsorship deals are fairly long-term,\" Jones points out, \"so football clubs are actually more protected than other businesses who look at the current economic climate and wonder how they will be doing next month.\"</p> <p>Clubs such as Blackburn, Bolton, West Bromwich Albion, Sunderland, Wigan and Middlesbrough did not need last week's news from the City of London to tell them of difficult economic circumstances - they are surrounded by them. Williams is acutely aware that Blackburn and much of east Lancashire have never struggled out of long-term decline and says most Rovers fans are in lower income bands. </p> <p>\"The A666 is not the King's Road, and we have to be aware of the impact of any recession,\" he says. </p> <p>Blackburn season tickets and corporate box sales are both slightly down this season and the club is working harder, as with Saturday's \"kids-for-a-quid\" offer, to attract crowds match by match.</p> <p>West Bromwich Albion provide a ready preview of how clubs may react if recession does bite their fans - they can reduce prices. West Midlands' traditional engineering economy has been grinding down for years, and Albion responded to promotion last season by cutting season ticket prices 11%, following 20% the previous season. That makes season tickets at The Hawthorns almost a third cheaper than when Albion were last in the Premier League. The result: full houses at all three home games so far. The demand is there. </p> <p>Much has been made of Albion starting the season without a sponsor, but the club's finance director, Mark Jenkins, says they are confident: \"Clearly companies are watching their budgets, but we are talking to two very attractive potential sponsors. However, we are not willing to under-sell our sponsorship and have a price below which we won't go.\"</p> <p>Below the gilded Premier League, clubs must battle harder to attract fans, sponsors and corporate customers, but Football League crowds are still at historically vast levels. Since football was cleaned up, reinvented and actively marketed following its Hillsborough nadir, a huge well of fan loyalty - gold dust for any business - has been amassed, and it looks durable, even in a recession.</p> <p>Of the economic downturn, one fan said last week: \"Obviously, if people lose their jobs, some will have to give up going to the match if they need the money to feed their kids. Mind you,\" he added, \"I'm not one of them.\"</p> <p>He may have been joking.</p>",

If people say I am too serious, quite honestly there is a lot to be serious about.\"</p> <p>He said he was offering \"a new settlement for new times,\" and insisted the crisis in the financial markets more than ever required an interventionist government \"that has the power to change lives\".</p> <p>In an oration necessarily light on costly policy commitments, he promised to abolish prescription charges for 250,000 cancer patients in England from April, an independent commissioner for victims of crime, a new settlement for social care, and a new legal duty on government to meet its commitment to abolish child poverty by 2020, which Labour believes the Tories will be unable to endorse.</p> <p>The hour-long speech won him genuine plaudits from across the party last night and will have bought him time, as his cabinet colleagues now wait for the verdict of the polls in coming months.</p> <p>It emerged last night that Ruth Kelly, the transport secretary, is stepping down from cabinet. She told Brown during the summer that she wanted to spend more time with her family of four children. Sources close to Kelly insisted that the devout Catholic's decision was motivated neither by disillusion with Brown nor by any religious disagreements over the human fertilization and embryology bill.</p> <p>At one point in his speech Brown drew on Sarah Palin, the Republican vice-presidential candidate, saying he had not come to London to join the establishment and he plagiarised Barack Obama's catchline, \"this is not about me but about you\".</p> <p>He also drew on the emotional traditions of US politics by unexpectedly allowing his wife, Sarah, to introduce and endorse him, to rapturous applause, just as Michelle Obama had introduced her husband at the Democratic convention.</p> <p>The audience warmed most to the barbed assaults on the \"salesmen\" Tories, including a personal attack on David Cameron in which Brown said the Tory leader was using his children as props, \"serving them up for spreads in the papers\".</p> <p>Brown insisted people had learned that they could not trust the Conservatives to run the economy, adding: \"Everyone knows I am in favour of apprenticeships, but let me tell you this is no time for a novice.\" Primarily aimed at Cameron, the barb was immediately seen to apply with equal force to his chief internal rival, David Miliband.</p> <p>Overall, Brown made little direct reference to the internal criticism that has plagued his conference, except to warn: \"The British people would never forgive us if at this time we looked inwards to the affairs of just our party, when our duty is to the interests of the country.\"</p> <p>But he also made his much anticipated, if limited apology, saying: \"Where I have made mistakes I'll put my hand up and try to put them right.\" He had been \"stung\" by the 10p tax rate fiasco, saying \"it really hurt that people felt I was not on the side of people on middle and modest incomes\", and promised he would never allow that to happen again.</p> <p>His single biggest pitch to the country was that in these uncertain times, his government \"will prove to be the rock of stability and fairness upon which people stand\".</p> <p>He said the last seven days were \"the week the world was spun on its axis, and old certainties turned on their heads\". \"Insuring people against the new risks and empowering people with new opportunities is the mission of the hour,\" he said.</p> <p>He promised a green paper on long-term social care and also promised to abolish all charges for patients with long-term conditions, an expensive pledge covering 5 million people.</p> <p>Brown's camp was jubilant last night. One former cabinet minister said: \"He found a new tone today and as a result he has bought himself some time, but this will be decided by the voters in the weeks and months to come.\"</p> <h2>Misquote claim</h2> <p>Gordon Brown was accused of misquoting shadow chancellor George Osborne when he said: \"In the week that banks were collapsing the man who wants to run our economy ... said 'it's a function of financial markets that people make loads of money out of the misery of others'.\"</p> <p>Speaking on Newsnight, Osborne actually said: \"No one takes pleasure from people making money out of the misery of others, but that is a function of capitalist markets. The real issue is what is (sic) the causes of this problem ... And the causes of the problem are an economy built on debt, a housing boom that went on for 10 years unchecked.\"<br><strong>Nicholas Watt</strong></p>",
  "<p>The financial meltdown in the money markets last week has not just put thousands of City jobs at risk and changed the landscape of our banking industry. Beyond the gleaming towers of Canary Wharf and the trading floors of the Square Mile, some of the poorest boroughs in the UK will also feel the fallout from the economic crisis unleashed by their wealthy neighbours. Hundreds of charities, schools and community projects in the east London boroughs of Tower Hamlets, Newham and Hackney, which have come to rely heavily on the largesse of City firms and their employees, are likely to suffer a major setback in their drive to tackle deprivation. </p> <p>For Eastside Young Leaders' Academy, the Newham-based charity and after-school programme for local black boys on the verge of exclusion - founded by former prison governor and ex-deputy mayor of London, Ray Lewis - the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers is expected to hit hard. The bank's European Foundation had donated \u00a3300,000 over three years to roll out the academy's unique combination of tutoring, strict discipline and mentoring to seven other disadvantaged boroughs.</p> <p>Lehman Brothers' employees also volunteered as mentors in the academy, developing the boys' social skills, business acumen and public speaking. Of the academy's relationship with Lehman Brothers, Lewis says in the company's 2007 Global Philanthropy report that the mentors \"give the boys permission to be great\". A vice-president from the bank sits on Eastside's board of trustees, helping to build the capacity of the organisation so that it can broaden its activities. </p> <p>Another casualty of Lehman's demise is likely to be a catch-up maths programme for primary school pupils. Every Child Counts, which involves one-to-one tuition for children who at the age of seven are identified as falling behind, had been promised a \u00a31m grant over five years to reach 30,000 pupils by 2010-11, when the scheme is to be introduced nationally. </p> <p><strong>Funding assurances</strong></p> <p>Jean Gross, director of the Every Child A Chance Trust, the City-based charity that runs the maths programme and a similar literacy programme that the government rolled out in primary schools nationally this month, says it has received only the first year of the grant, but has had assurances from Lehman Brothers that the pending \u00a3800,000 is secure. She says: \"The European Foundation is a separate company from the investment bank, so we have been told that the funding should come through.\" </p> <p>Asked about UK organisations promised donations from the Lehman Brothers Foundation Europe, Andrea Sullivan, Lehman Brothers' head of corporate philanthropy and cultural partnerships Europe and the Middle East, says: \"We're doing everything we can to honour the commitments the foundation has made.\" </p> <p>Yet even if the cash arrives, charities are bracing themselves for the knock-on effect of up to 5,000 job losses at the bankrupt bank and possible job cuts at other City firms. Volunteering programmes, charity-of-the-year fundraising activities and payroll giving schemes will all be hit.</p> <p>Southwark-based Kids Company has already received a number of cancellations from groups of former Lehman Brother employees who will no longer be volunteer painters and decorators to brighten up the homes of deprived young people. \"It's so sad,\" says the children's charity's founder, Camila Batmanghelidjh. \"These are young people often living in unbelievable squalor with a single parent who has mental health problems.\" </p> <p>The charity, which works with some of the most damaged inner-city children, has over the last year received \u00a3100,000-worth of support from Lehman Brothers, including the donation of time from some 500 staff. \"We had built up a great relationship with the bank,\" Batmanghelidjh says. \"Even in the thick of the crisis last week when they had all lost their jobs, someone bothered to call us to say they had things in the corporate office they wanted to give us, such as T-shirts.\" </p> <p>Every Child A Chance had hoped that Lehman staff could work with children who had come through Every Child A Reader and Every Child Counts intitiavies. \"That is an irretrievable loss,\" Gross says. </p> <p>But is not just the high-profile recipients of Lehman Brothers support that will be hit. Well-established corporate social responsibility (CSR) links, developed over years between the firm and schools to attract working-class and ethnic minority youth into financial services, will suffer. Oaklands school, in Tower Hamlets, will be hard hit when 20 regular volunteers from Lehman fail to turn up for the extra literacy classes with pupils this week. The decade-long relationship - which included Saturday study days at Lehman Brothers' Canary Wharf offices, mock job interviews, and work experience, as well as extra help with reading, science and languages - has been shortlisted for the 2008 Lord Mayor's Dragon award, which next month will recognise outstanding CSR across London. </p> <p>Oaklands' headteacher, Patrice Canavan, says the long-standing support has increased her pupils' confidence and aspiration. \"Lehman Brothers has a very can-do mentality,\" she says. \"Although many of our pupils come from challenging circumstances, they expect them to achieve. We will hopefully find new partners, but it will be a very tall order to match Lehman Brothers.\"</p> <p><strong>Plug the hole</strong></p> <p>Mike Tyler, director of Tower Hamlets Education Business Partnership, will have the job of filling the gap left by the loss of more than 100 Lehman Brothers staff in the borough's schools. He has a pool of about 4,500 City firm volunteers who are helping to bridge the skills gap between what local students can offer and what employers expect. He also needs to find companies willing to plug the financial hole left by the investment bank, which has funded its Getting Ahead and Passport to Employment programmes.</p> <p>But should some of the Lehman Brothers' business units continue under new ownership at Barclays and Japanese bank Nomura, Tyler believes there is a chance its support may resume. He is also cautiously optimistic that an award-winning Merrill Lynch programme to help disaffected pupils become budding entrepreneurs could be unscathed by last week's Bank of America takeover. \"We have just got funding for another year, and hope the new owners will leave its community programme alone,\" he says. \"We don't know what will emerge from the ashes. We have reserves for a rainy day - and at the moment it's very rainy.\"</p> <p>But in the US, where Lehman's US Foundation distributed $39m (\u00a321m) to more than 200 not-for-profit organisations in the year up to November 2007, the voluntary sector is already counting the cost. \"The philanthropy of Lehman Brothers will leave a gap for New York City,\" says Melissa Berman, chief executive of Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors.</p> <p>In the UK, 20 CSR managers from leading City law firms and banks met on Friday to agree to try to fill gaps in charity funding or volunteering left by the current turmoil. Carolyn Housman, corporate responsibility manager at the City of London Corporation, says: \"Many financial firms we work with have let us know that they are keen to fill any potential shortfalls that are a result of recent economic activities.\"</p> <p>Although not exactly a cast-iron rescue package, Housman adds: \"There's a sense we need to pull together and cover each other. They are definitely taking collective responsibility and collective action.\"</p> <p>The charities and community groups already reeling from the City crash hope the move signals that a strong culture of giving will survive a recession. Gross says: \"The City needs to be philanthropic because it wants to maintain the positive image [charities] have of it.\"</p>",
  "<p>Ian Pearson needs to get his science straight before considering taking a stance in support of GM (Science minister attempts to reopen the debate on GM crops, September 22). Properties such as innate pest or blight resistance, drought or salt tolerance and yield are sophisticated processes that manifest from the function of multiple genes working in a tightly regulated, coordinated manner. The introduction of such properly functioning complex gene networks in plants by the crude and genetically disruptive GM transformation process is currently not possible. Fortunately, we have better alternatives that can contribute to alleviating the world's food problems now. </p> <p>First, the biotechnological procedure of marker-assisted selection (MAS), which uses our increasing knowledge of gene maps, can significantly expedite the identification of new crop varieties with complex desirable properties created by natural cross-breeding programmes. Unlike GM, there are no inherent safety concerns with MAS that makes use of the vast gene pool of any given food crop in a manner that retains natural gene order and function. </p> <p>Second, a 1996 report by the National Research Council in the US highlighted that there already exist many crops such as fonio, pearl millet, African rice that are naturally adapted to harsh climates and marginal soils as well as being nutritious and tasty. Unfortunately, outside interference has led to these hardy staples being displaced by maize, wheat and Asian rice. In the face of climate change, the world needs fast solutions to its food problems, which MAS and a return to traditional food varieties can provide and which GM simply cannot deliver.</p> <p><strong>Dr Michael Antoniou</strong><br>King's College London </p> <p>Ian Pearson's comments reveal a government increasingly prepared to act as a mouthpiece for the GM industry. GM crops have failed to deliver - they do not yield more than conventional crops and there is not a single GM drought or salt-tolerant crop available commercially. </p> <p>The government's own GM public debate in 2003 revealed widespread scepticism over both GM crops and corporate control of the food system. Instead of trying to convince the public to support GM and continuing to fund this unpopular and ineffective technology, the government must focus on the real farming solutions backed by 400 scientists in a recent UN report on the future of agriculture. This means meeting local food needs by combining science and technology with communities' traditional knowledge to support localised and diverse farming.</p> <p><strong>Clare Oxborrow</strong><br>Food campaigner, Friends of the Earth </p> <p>Another week, another government minister tries to persuade us to grow GM crops. It is as if the UN report earlier this year, endorsed by the UK government, has been forgotten. The International Assessment of Agricultural Science and Technology for Development report said GM technology was not a quick fix to feed the world's poor. The 400 scientists who wrote it said they saw little role for GM in feeding the poor on a large scale; data on some GM crops indicated highly variable yield gains in some places and declines in others. GM crops are not banned in the UK; it is just that hardly anyone wants to buy them, and so no farmer wants to risk growing them. The environment minister, Phil Woolas, is giving opponents of GM crops a year to join in a debate. What will happen at the end of this one-year consultation that will be different to the situation as it stands today?</p> <p><strong>Roger Mainwood</strong><br>Wivenhoe, Essex </p> <p>Ian Pearson believes that the British public would accept GM crops if they were beneficial to consumers. Yet the public would gladly forgo those benefits if they knew what the government is ignoring: that every feeding trial carried out by independent scientists on laboratory animals results in serious harm to their health. Government assurances of safety rely on tests submitted by the GM seed developers. There are many other reasons why GM crops should be neither grown nor eaten, but these facts alone should suffice to call for a moratorium, at least, and not promotion. Ministers are failing in their responsibility to protect the people and the environment in their zeal to promote the economy. </p> <p><strong>Eva Novotny</strong><br>Cambridge</p>",
  "<h2>Matthew d'Ancona, editor of The Spectator, on the magazine's Coffee House blog (<a href=\"http://spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse\">spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse</a>)</h2> <p>Cheesy, vacuous - and occasionally brilliant, this was indeed the speech of Gordon Brown's life ... this was the product of desperation, it's tactics a measure of how bad things have got and how far the PM is willing to go to cling to power. From the appearance of Sarah Brown, Michelle Obama-style, to the implicit dig at Cameron for parading his children, to the eschewing of statistics - \"that's not just a number\" - from the driest political statistician of them all, to the hokey soundbite \"one hope at a time\", this was pure, shameless, vintage political theatre. </p> <p>Cynical as hell, but splendid, too. He won't go without a fight. He will die with his boots on. Over to you, Labour mutineers.</p> <h2>Labour councillor Kerron Cross (<a href=\"http://kerroncross.blogspot.com\">kerroncross.blogspot.com</a>)</h2> <p>\"Not Flash, just Gordon ... when he is under pressure Gordon has the ability to be a brilliant performer ... Gordon is a details man. David Cameron is not, he is an opportunist, a salesman with a dodgy product no one wants ... Gordon played to his strengths. He has beliefs. He wants to do the right thing. And hey, if you don't like him, then fine - he will just get on with doing the right thing and take it on the chin. The pressure is back on a policy-less Cameron. He has to do it all again next week, and if he blows it - like his reaction to the economic problems Britain faced - it could be all to play for again.'</p> <h2>Nick Robinson, BBC political editor, on his blog (<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/nickrobinson/\">www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/nickrobinson/</a>)</h2> <p>\"This job\" - the prime minister declared today - \"is not about me. It is about you\". His speech, however, was all about him. It was an invitation to both party and country to look at him again.</p> <p>A man normally so awkward talking about himself did just that - trying to turn weaknesses into strengths ... Today Gordon Brown was, in effect, reapplying for his own job - well sometimes you have to in difficult times.</p> <h2>MartinR, commenting on the theguardian.com politics liveblog of the speech (<a href=\"http://theguardian.com/politics/blog\">theguardian.com/politics/blog</a>)</h2> <p>The question is, if Brown is capable of being this animated why the heck has he been acting like a (sustainably planted) tree for the past 12 months?'</p> <h2>Gerald Warner on the Telegraph's blog (<a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/gerald_warner\">blogs.telegraph.co.uk/gerald_warner</a>)</h2> <p>It was a classic Brown package. The theme of \"a new settlement for the global age\" had the typical smack of Brown pretentiousness, the relentless schmaltz about imaginary people benefiting from Labour's largesse, while ignoring the millions impoverished by 11 years of prodigality, met all the yardsticks of hypocrisy.</p>",
  "<p>'Oh God. It's more important than the clothes.\" The music? \"Yeah, I mean, the clothes I don't worry about because I do my best, and that's all I can do. But, if the music isn't right, then people aren't in the right mood and it's very, very difficult to get a collection.\" </p> <p>Dame Vivienne Westwood reaches for her reading glasses to eye up the tracks listed on the sleeve of Catwalk Breakdown, the new album she has put together of all the \"great music to walk to\" regularly featured over the decades in her catwalk shows. To her left sits Peaches Geldof, texting ceaselessly. It's London fashion week (LFW) and Westwood is holding court in one of Selfridges' personal shopping suites, while downstairs a cocktail reception is taking place in her honour. \"I mean, for someone to know what's going on and what's new and what's special, even to get the silhouette,\" she continues, \"you don't always get it that easily. So the music is to sort of help [the audience] enjoy what's happening, get them in a good mood. You have to create everything possible to help.\" </p> <p>Westwood happily admits that she hasn't listened to pop music \"since the Sex Pistols\". But while she isn't interested in spearheading a teenage musical revolution these days, she does hope her first ever release will introduce people to some music they haven't heard before. \"Link Wray, Tchaikovsky, the New York Dolls, Mae West doing Great Balls Of Fire ... now that is just fantastic.\"</p> <p>It's a sentiment shared by almost all of LFW's music coordinators, whom I speak to over the course of the week. Each is given a brief (some tighter than others, depending on the designer) about the mood of the show and the atmosphere the music should invoke. Then it's up to the coordinators to come back with a long list of usually 12 songs - almost all of which include unsigned or unknown artists, all vying for an outside chance of runway exposure. </p> <p>\"Fashion shows are a great platform for new acts,\" explains Jean Noel Young, who works on the music for Topman, Ossie Clark and Richard Nicoll among others. \"The music gives the fashion the edge, but that association works in reverse too. People are more likely to use music in adverts if they've seen it at a show.\"</p> <p>Sometimes the coordinators-turned-talent-spotters get lucky and their new finds get green-lighted by the designers for the final soundtrack. Tony Farsides, who has worked with Stella McCartney on her last 14 shows, credits himself with breaking such acts as Santogold and MIA in this way. \"With Santogold, we first used a song of hers nearly two years ago. Basically, she'd posted something up on MySpace about a week before I came across it. She didn't have a record deal or anything. It was the same with MIA and Dizzee Rascal, we had both their stuff in the show before they were signed.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, David Bailey Ross, music producer for Christopher Kane, doesn't give himself anything like enough credit for being one of the first people in the UK to pick up on New Jersey's disco-revivalist label Italians Do It Better - now one of the most name-checked electro labels. Two of its highest-profile acts, Glass Candy and Farah, were first used way back in Kane's spring/summer 08 show. </p> <p>PPQ's Amy Molyneux and Percy Parker understand the fusion of music and fashion so well that they started up the record label 1234 to release the tunes that scored their shows. So what comes first for them, the soundtrack or the clothes? \"It's a circular affair. You go out, hear music, get inspired ... go home, draw, make it, wear it, inspire someone while you're out.\"</p> <p>Which raises the question, which songs do LFW's spring/summer 09 collections predict will be soundtracking our Sony Bravia ads and getting-ready-to-go-out routines come May? Well, there's more consensus than you might think. Both Steve Mackey and Primal Scream's Bobby Gillespie thought of San Franciscan psych-garage band Wooden Shjips when they were asked to come up with the music for Giles and Luella respectively. Although Mackey (record producer, boyfriend of Katie Grand and former bassist of Pulp) chose to team them with experimental head-melters such as Bristol's Fuck Buttons and LA's HEALTH for Giles Deacon's retro-futurist collection. Bobby, meanwhile, kept it more classic for Luella: \"They just said they wanted something psychedelic-y, so I put in Contact by Brigitte Bardot, which is trashy but sexy, y'know, and an instrumental remix of 2,000 Light Years Away From Home by the Rolling Stones.\" </p> <p>Elsewhere, this year's debut album by Swedish chanteuse Lykke Li proved so malleable that parts of it were used to soundtrack both Topshop Unique's Desperately Seeking Susan vibe and Ossie Clark's Emmanuelle-themed sauce-athon. Twenty-six-year-old London producer and remixer Duke Dumont proved the hippest name to drop, with his edit of Debbie Deb's When I Hear Music kickstarting the week (Topshop, Sunday), and bringing it to a chilly climax with his practically indistinguishable rewiring of Mystery Jets' indie-dancefloor smash Two Doors Down, six days later at MAN, the menswear event. </p> <p>Like the clothes, the soundtracks seemed psychically pre-programmed to swerve the miserable economic realities hitting the rest of the city outside the heavily bouncered doors, with designers briefing music producers to think \"up\" (70s disco glamour at Temperley London, 80s club kids at Topshop), \"up and relentless\" (refined decadence and Je T'aime at Jaeger), and even \"up and sporty\" (gymnastics and Toni Basil at Stella McCartney for Adidas). </p> <p>Some were even more shameless in their denial. While the City was crashing just five miles away across town, Antoni &amp; Alison's exotic, escapist collection featured a homemade soundtrack of tropical noises and animal calls. \"We wanted to run away from everything,\" admitted Antoni. Meanwhile, Christopher Kane's \"prehistoric, Planet Of The Apes and jungle\" themed show wound up its soundtrack of tribal rhythms, Neopolitan opera, anime scores and tigers roaring with I Wan'na Be Like You from The Jungle Book. \"Christopher always likes to end his show on a fun and upbeat note,\" explained Bailey Ross. </p> <p>Still, at least there's one woman we can rely on not to bury her head in the sand. \"I've written a rap song against these 42 days that the government want to do,\" says Westwood, back in Selfridges, discussing the track she has written in opposition to the new terror suspect detention laws and hopes to record with stoner rock titans Queens of the Stone Age. \"I was talking to Shami Chakrabarti [director of the pressure group Liberty] and I said, shall we chain ourselves to the railings and all this kind of stuff? Anyway, I wrote this song as an idea of something to do to try and prevent it. I've been trying to find someone to sing on it, but I'll probably have to do it myself.\" There we have it, the biggest breakthrough act of London fashion week: a 67-year-old rapper with tangerine hair and a DBE.

  "<p>George Bush stood unrepentant and unbowed before the 192 member countries of the UN general assembly yesterday to deliver a valedictory address devoted almost entirely to terrorism, which he described as an evil that must be defeated.</p> <p>In his eighth and final address to a largely silent hall of world leaders, the US president sounded a note that has changed remarkably little since he first spoke to the general assembly in the wake of the September 11 2001 attacks on New York and Washington DC. He said the global movement of violent extremists remained a challenge as serious as any since the foundation of the UN in 1945: \"Like slavery and piracy, terrorism has no place in the modern world,\" he said.</p> <p>Bush took the opportunity to assess his two terms in power that contained no regrets and no apology.</p> <p>Afghanistan and Iraq had been transformed, he said, \"from regimes that actively sponsor terror to democracies that fight terror\".</p> <p>Libya had renounced its backing of extremists and dropped its pursuit of nuclear weapons, and Pakistan and Saudi Arabia were engaged in</p> <p>the struggle to root out extremism. Democracy, too, had spread around the world under his watch. \"Whenever or wherever people are given the choice, they chose freedom,\" he said.</p> <p>In the seven years since Bush launched the so-called war on terror, his administration has become among the most controversial in US history. It has been criticised on the world stage for flouting international law, and for ineffective handling of the aftermaths of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p> <p>The speech came at a time when many of the objectives of the Bush administration appear to be facing reverses.</p> <p>The Taliban are on the rise again in Afghanistan, violence is rife in Pakistan, the Middle East peace initiative has stalled, and attempts to stop Iran and North Korea from developing a nuclear capacity are wavering.</p> <p>There was only passing reference to such downsides to his legacy during the 21 minutes of the speech. The only hint at fallibility came with the concession that \"we have witnessed successes and setbacks\" and a reference to the fight in Iraq as having been \"difficult\".</p> <p>The decision to go ahead with the invasion of Iraq in 2003 without approval from the UN constituted one of the most serious blows to the authority of the world body since its founding. Bush hinted at the upheaval by talking about the \"disagreements our nations have had on Iraq\" but added that daily life in the country had improved dramatically in the past two years and \"we should all welcome this progress towards stability and peace\". Though Bush chided the UN at the height of the Iraq crisis for being close to an irrelevance, he did offer an olive branch yesterday, saying that the extremist threat made multilateral organisations \"needed more than ever\".</p> <p>The president had direct words to say to the delegations seated in front of him from Russia, which he said had violated the UN charter by sending troops into Georgia. \"We must stand united in our support of the people of Georgia. Young democracies around the world are watching to see how we respond to this test,\" he said.</p> <p>He also singled out North Korea and Iran for their nuclear programmes, calling on the UN to impose stiffened sanctions against both, and Iran and Syria for continuing to sponsor terror.</p> <p>The inclusion of Iran on both his lists of culprits was not lost on Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Iran's president. Ahmadinejad addressed the assembly a few hours after Bush, and accused the US of making illegal demands against what he called Iran's \"peaceful nuclear programme\".</p> <p>He also effectively accused Israel of controlling the US presidential contest, saying \"a small but deceitful minority of Zionists are playing with the American public\".</p> <p>Meanwhile a separate round of diplomacy also attracted attention - that of the Republican vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin. She began a series of meetings with world leaders including the Afghan president Hamid Karzai and Colombian president \u00c1lvaro Uribe, but remained firmly behind closed doors with no media in attendance.</p> <h2>Shadow of 9/11</h2> <p>President Bush's final speech to the UN general assembly on Tuesday brings him back full circle to November 10 2001 when he first delivered a belligerent address to world leaders that set out the fundamentals of what would come to be known as his \"war on terror\".</p> <p>The dust had barely settled over Ground Zero following the 9/11 attacks that had occurred less than two months previously. As he told the world leaders in a special Saturday session at the UN building in New York, \"a few miles from here, many thousands still lie in a tomb of rubble\".</p> <p>The shadow of 9/11 hung over the UN building on that day, and set the tone of Bush's address to the world. \"The time for sympathy has now passed. The time for action has now arrived,\" he said. \"Each of us must answer for what we have done or what we have left undone\".</p> <p>In hindsight, the 22-minute oration Bush gave on November 11 2001 gave a clear taste of the rest of his presidency. \"For every regime that sponsors terror, there is a price to be paid. And it will be paid,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>It began as a fairytale: a fluffy polar bear cub gave pleasure to millions around the world after being saved from death by his keeper. Then Berlin zoo turned into a media circus and the troubled adolescent bear, said to be addicted to applause, was forcibly separated from the man who had reared him by hand.</p> <p>Now the tale of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/knut\">Knut</a> has ended in tragedy after his keeper, who hand-fed him milk and porridge for 150 days straight, was found dead at his apartment in Berlin.</p> <p>Thomas Doerflein did not seek fame but found it through Knut, who was rejected by his mother and would have died were it not for the 44-year-old's ministrations. As Knut became a global sensation, animal rights activists argued that he should be killed because it was unnatural and cruel to keep a rejected bear alive.</p> <p>Some felt vindicated when it emerged that Knut, who grew up surrounded by screaming crowds, began \"crying\" when short of human attention. They could scarcely have imagined the bear's global celebrity might have been equally cruel on his human carer.</p> <p>Doerflein was a quiet man who had worked for the zoo since he was 16. He turned down numerous interview and chat show requests, although he appeared on the Knut DVD - just one piece of Knut paraphernalia - which revealed the extraordinary tenderness between man and bear as Doerflein played Knut the guitar and taught him to swim.</p> <p>When Doerflein did speak, he sounded bewildered by the attention. \"Here on my desk is a pile of love letters from around the world - they're even sending me poems and songs they've written about me,\" he once told the newspaper Der Tagesspiegel. \"When I leave work I get besieged by young women. I'm afraid to go out there.\"</p> <p>There was disquiet about the zoo's marketing of the bear and a rival zoo in northern Germany, which housed Knut's father, began legal action against Berlin claiming it was due a slice of Knut's fortune. If it had been a dispute over a child star, it would probably have attracted headlines about \"the curse of Knut\".</p> <p>Now nearly two years old and an \"activist\" for global warming, Knut will be blissfully ignorant of his former keeper's fate. The cause of Doerflein's death is not yet known but police reportedly found no evidence of foul play or suicide. We may never know, however, just how profound an impact one polar bear had on the life of his human \"father\".</p>",
  "<p>Those of us who have long argued for a significant level of devolution from Whitehall to town halls sometimes face a dilemma in a country without a written constitution, and consequently no defined boundaries between central and local government. We believe that a progressive national government will balance strengthened town, city and neighbourhood democracy with the state setting national standards in, say, health, social care, education and community safety to ensure that services are evenly spread.</p> <p>Like it or not, that requires national inspectorates to maintain equity between areas. The danger comes when a more reactionary government exploits devolution as a cover for reducing the role of the state, perhaps as a pretext for sweeping economies in the caring services and elsewhere. </p> <p>Next week, at the Conservatives' annual conference, we will doubtless be hearing about the need to set councils and communities free from Whitehall control - about the centralised state bearing down on citizens and threatening local democracy. </p> <p>New localism is in fashion. But we should beware. While some Tory local authorities offer a level of service, care and efficiency that could be a template, others see their role as light-touch organisations, putting economy ahead of caring.</p> <p>This is not to suggest that all Labour or Liberal Democrat councils are model authorities. Lib Dem Liverpool, condemned by the Audit Commission this year for its financial incompetence and political in-fighting, needs help. Last week, a Health is Wealth Commission in the city produced measures to improve the wellbeing of a million people in a conurbation where life expectancy is seven years shorter than parts of the south-east. Its chair, Sue Woodward, spoke of generations of families dependent on benefits, spiralling problems with obesity and alcohol misuse, and an \"invisible army of people ... cut off from the opportunities being created on their own doorstep\". With the city in political and financial chaos, someone has to intervene with the commission. It can only be the state as the social champion of last resort.</p> <p>This week, in an interview with Society Guardian, communities secretary Hazel Blears warns of the dangers from a Conservative government intent on cutting back further on the Audit Commission's inspection regime. \"Why have government if it is not about ... saying we need more homes, better social care and health?\" she says.</p> <p>Her point is that greater devolution, in the wrong hands, can be regressive, a cover for cuts in the caring services. Could David Cameron's new-found enthusiasm for the third sector mean the state pulling back from supporting all manner of programmes by off-loading responsibilities to social enterprises and charities? Of course, while he might deny any such intent, those radical elements of the party associated with neocons in the US see the charitable sector as preferable to social care provided by the state.</p> <p>Yet, in the deepening global financial crisis, the case for a stronger state - building more social homes, rescuing some householders in negative equity and helping those on low incomes meet fuel bills - grows stronger each day. It is simply unacceptable for Conservatives to argue that the state has no role in setting, say, housebuilding levels, and other targets, on the grounds that councils should decide numbers. </p> <p>It also has another role: ensuring, through the inspection regime, that councils and NHS trusts are run efficiently and fairly. That does not mean mindless political intervention. It might, in the case of the NHS, mean enhanced local democracy. But it should also mean that someone is there to pick up the pieces, in a city like Liverpool, when all else fails. Unless we want to descend to the social inequity of the US, that has to be the state.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Peter Hetherington writes on communities and regeneration.</p>",
  "<p>People who believe they have the greenest lifestyles can be seen as some of the main culprits behind global warming, says a team of researchers, who claim that many ideas about sustainable living are a myth.</p> <p>According to the researchers, people who regularly recycle rubbish and save energy at home are also the most likely to take frequent long-haul flights abroad. The carbon emissions from such flights can swamp the green savings made at home, the researchers claim.</p> <p>Stewart Barr, of Exeter University, who led the research, said: \"Green living is largely something of a myth. There is this middle class environmentalism where being green is part of the desired image. But another part of the desired image is to fly off skiing twice a year. And the carbon savings they make by not driving their kids to school will be obliterated by the pollution from their flights.\"</p> <p>Some people even said they deserved such flights as a reward for their green efforts, he added.</p> <p>Only a very small number of citizens matched their eco-friendly behaviour at home by refusing to fly abroad, Barr told a climate change conference at Exeter University yesterday.</p> <p>The research team questioned 200 people on their environmental attitudes and split them into three groups, based on a commitment to green living. </p> <p>They found the longest and the most frequent flights were taken by those who were most aware of environmental issues, including the threat posed by climate change. </p> <p>Questioned on their heavy use of flying, one respondent said: \"I recycle 100% of what I can, there's not one piece of paper goes in my bin, so that makes me feel less guilty about flying as much as I do.\"</p> <p>Barr said \"green\" lifestyles at home and frequent flying were linked to income, with wealthier people more likely to be engaged in both activities.</p> <p>He said: \"The findings indicate that even those people who appear to be very committed to environmental action find it difficult to transfer these behaviours into more problematic contexts.\"</p> <p>The team says the research is one of the first attempts to analyse how green intentions alter depending on context. It says the results reveal the scale of the challenge faced by policymakers who are trying to alter public behaviour to help tackle global warming. </p> <p>The study concludes: \"The notion that we can treat what we do in the home differently from what we do on holiday denies the existence of clearly related and complex lifestyle choices and practices. Yet even a focus on lifestyle groups who may be most likely to change their views will require both time and political will. The addiction to cheap flights and holidays will be very difficult to break.\"</p> <p>The frequent flyers said they expected new technology to make aviation greener, echoing comments made by Tony Blair last year, who said it was \"impractical\" to expect people to take holidays closer to home. He said the solution was \"to look at how you make air travel more energy-efficient, how you develop the new fuels that will allow us to burn less energy and emit less.\"</p>",
  "<p>Public confusion over the environmental agenda appears to be as high as ever, with a majority in the UK calling for more action to tackle climate change while at the same time saying they are not willing to pay more to help.</p> <p>Nearly two-thirds of people told a poll by Opinium they thought recent government measures to boost energy conservation needed to go much further, and half said they were doing their bit by installing insulation or turning down the thermostat.</p> <p>However more than seven out of 10 of the nearly 2,000 people questioned said they were unwilling to pay higher taxes to combat environmental issues, and a similar number believed the green agenda had been \"hijacked\" to increase taxes.</p> <p>The timing of the survey last week could also have had an impact on willingness to pay higher prices, coming as daily headlines warned about recession, unemployment, rising prices and a collapse in the housing market.</p> <p>Mark Hodson, Opinium's head of research, said the public had lost faith in both politicians and the energy companies that they blame for huge price hikes in recent months.</p> <p>\"A massive 78% of people think that energy companies profits are unfair,\" said Hodson. </p> <p>\"Rising energy bills have affected the majority of people in the past year and the public seem to be as disheartened by the recent energy measures as they are by green taxes. </p> <p>\"It is probably due to this fact that [59%] think the government should have gone much further.\"</p> <p>Public confusion was also a result of having a debate which was too \"narrowly\" focused on pitting the environment against economic wealth and other issues, said Tom Compton, change strategist for environmental group WWF.</p> <p>\"We can't rely exclusively on this convergence of economic growth and the business case for sustainable development on the one hand and environmental demands on the other,\" said Compton. </p> <p>\"There are areas where these things converge, but similarly there are cases where they diverge; at the moment we are failing abjectly to grapple with those areas where they diverge. </p> <p>\"That requires a more fundamental engagement with and understanding of what our collective aspirations are: what's important to us?\"</p> <p>London-based Opinium Research surveyed 1,975 adults by email from a panel of 30,000 regularly used by the company. The results were weighted to match age, sex, geography and other nationally representative criteria.</p>",
  "<p>As world leaders prepare to gather in New York for yet another UN summit on poverty, one question looms large: is there any point? The answer will depend on whether the meeting recycles old platitudes or sets out practical plans for combating deprivation, disease and illiteracy.</p> <p>The summit is an attempt to renew support for the millennium development goals - the targets adopted for the reduction of global deprivation by 2015. They include cutting child deaths by two-thirds, the rate at which mothers die in childbirth by three-quarters, extreme poverty and malnutrition by half - and making available universal primary education.</p> <p>With public attention locked on to the credit crisis, and rising energy and food costs, it's easy to lose sight of what's at stake: 10 million children die each year from preventable, poverty-related diseases; there are 1.4 billion people in the world surviving on less than $1.25 a day; and more than 70 million primary school-age children are out of school.</p> <p>The development goals are supposed to be a sort of promissory note for the world's poor redeemable in 2015. But at the moment they have all the credibility of a sub-prime mortgage security. </p> <p>Business-as-usual projections tell their own story. The gap between the pledges and projected outcome in 2015 is equivalent to 4.5 million child deaths, more than the entire under-five population of the UK. What can the UN summit do to change this picture? Rich countries need to stop talking and start delivering on aid and trade.</p> <p>Three years ago at the Gleneagles G8 summit, countries promised a step increase in aid. Since then, aid flows have been stagnating, and research indicates developed countries are $30bn down on their commitments. And it's real money, not promises, that builds schools, pays health workers and funds pipes to carry clean water. The UN summit is an opportunity for recalcitrant donors to fulfil their promises.</p> <p>Then there was Doha. This was supposed to be the trade talks' \"development round\". Rich countries were going to open their markets to the poorest and slash the farm subsidies that undermine developing countries' agricultural economies. In the event, the only thing that has been slashed is the credibility of the World Trade Organisation. </p> <p>It would be too much to expect the UN summit to revive the corpse of Doha. But developed countries could provide full market access for the poorest countries in other regions. Listen to some millennium development goal enthusiasts and you'd think all that stands between the world and those targets is a lack of aid generosity and fairer trade rules. Sadly it's not. Developing country governments have much to answer for.</p> <p>Take the case of India. For almost two decades the country has been in the premier league of world economic growth. Meanwhile, the child death toll is falling at less than half the rate needed to achieve the UN target. The economy might be booming, but 45% of India's children are still malnourished. India may be a world leader in delivering hi-tech computer services to global markets, but a public health system that saves children from diarrhoea? Forget it.</p> <p>But there are positive examples too. In Brazil, the Bolsa Familia programme provides income transfers of $35 a month to 11 million of the poorest families. In return, they make a commitment to keep their children in school and take them for health checks. The scheme is reducing inequality, helping extend opportunity and breaking the transmission of poverty across generations. It's called redistributive social justice. It works - and more countries should try it.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Kevin Watkins is senior research fellow at Oxford University's global economic governance </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:programme geg@univ.ox.ac.uk\">programme geg@univ.ox.ac.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>The JD Sports fashion group yesterday reported a performance most other retailers can only dream about at the moment - with sales and profits rising fast.</p> <p>The group, which operates 345 JD outlets and also owns the 85-strong Bank and Scotts fashion chains, said like-for-like sales in the six months to August 2 were ahead 6% and profits before one-off charges were up 54% on 2007 levels to \u00a312.4m. Total sales were up 19% to nearly \u00a3300m.</p> <p>Both the sports and fashion fascias grew strongly and the momentum has continued since the end of the first half. The retailer said it was \"strongly positioned\" for the rest of the year.</p> <p>The shares climbed 9% to 300p, helped by a stock exchange disclosure that billionaire Mike Ashley had snapped up 115,000 more JD shares on September 3. Ashley, who controls the rival Sports Direct empire and Newcastle United FC, now speaks for 13.2% of JD, worth some \u00a319m, and the shares have risen 8% since his latest purchase. However, they are still 50% down on their peak of 602p 16 months ago.</p> <p>JD, led by executive chairman Peter Cowgill, made a strategic decision to steer clear of the replica shirt market in favour of fashion sportswear and its own labels and exclusive brands such as McKenzie and K-Swiss. Cowgill said he was \"delighted\" with the performance of the business.</p> <p>Underperforming sports stores have been closed and others are being refurbished to achieve a \"consistent quality, look and feel\". About 20 stores, including outlets in centres such as Bluewater and Gateshead MetroCentre, were given a makeover in the first half at a cost of \u00a37.3m. By the end of this year 37 outlets will have been revamped, costing a total \u00a312.2m. Nine new stores were opened in the first half and several more will open there doors by the year end.</p> <p>The group has \u00a33.5m net cash and is paying an interim dividend of 3.1p, up 24% on last year. In the most recent weeks the fashion chains have seen an 8.2% increase in like-for-like sales, while JD Sports sales have been ahead 5.4%. </p> <p>Rivals JJB and Sports Direct, meanwhile, are closing unprofitable stores and have both reported difficult trading. </p> <p>Sports Direct, 72% controlled by Ashley, has described trading conditions as the worst it has ever experienced.

  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337909448\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1813552003_gdn-nat-080923-BrownSpeechClips-FLV-4x3.flv\"/> </video>   <p>It seems a long time ago now, back in the spring of 2007, when the Labour tribe was so certain Gordon Brown was the right man to lead them they didn't even want a contest for the top job. They had a clear image of the prime minister, he would be: solid, anchored in moral purpose, a heavyweight able to punch the light out of the Tories - and with a reddish tinge which meant he stood, even if not openly, to the left of Tony Blair.</p> <p>That was the Gordon Brown the Labour faithful hoped they were getting 15 months ago. In the past year, many had almost forgotten him, as a different character seemed to take up residence in Downing Street: Bottler Brown, the ditherer who ducked an election and took from the poor with a scrapped 10p tax rate, who could barely speak like a human being and who watched, paralysed, as a 12-point Labour lead turned into a 20-point deficit.</p> <p>But for one sweet hour yesterday afternoon that man was banished, replaced by the Gordon Brown Labour once yearned for. In a speech performed with greater skill than any of his previous efforts - the cadences rising and falling in the right places, the high-volume, machine gun delivery ditched - the prime minister reminded the Labour party of why they had once admired him so much.</p> <p>The improvement began even before he had appeared. In a surprise piece of stagecraft, his wife Sarah came to the podium to rapturous applause - one of several elements yesterday borrowed from the recently-completed US convention season. Like Michelle Obama or Cindy McCain, she testified to her husband's devotion to public service. Her unflashiness, the sense that she has endured tough times as well as good, threw a kind of protective layer over the PM: he gained credit by association.</p> <p>Brown built on that, insisting \"I'm serious about doing a serious job.\" Riskily, given that he had just deployed his own wife, he bragged that he had not \"served up my children for spreads in the papers\" - a clear dig at David Cameron, who is often photographed with his family - because \"My children aren't props; they're people.\" It was a return to the message he had sought to convey in that distant summer of 2007: not flash, just Gordon.</p> <p>He marched on determined to retake the moral high ground. Speaking more personally than usual, he offered a quasi-apology for the 10p tax error, saying he was \"stung\" by the accusation that he was no longer \"on the side of hard-working families\", vowing that from now on \"it's the only place I ever will be\".</p> <p>He borrowed a line from Barack Obama's convention speech to ram home the point: \"This job is not about me. It's about you.\" More surprisingly, Brown cast himself as a Scottish Sarah Palin, adapting one of her signature lines, though with Fife in place of Alaska and Westminster in place of Washington: \"I didn't come to London because I wanted to join the establishment, but because I wanted to - and want to - change it.\"</p> <p>But Brown's chief effort was to push the image of himself which, during those first three months in Number 10, had begun to take root in the public mind, before it was so pushed aside. He would be \"the rock of stability\".</p> <p>Brown will hope this stems the decline in his standing but that was not his primary purpose yesterday. With talk throughout the conference of a plot against him - the only issue being when, not if, he would be toppled - addressing the wider public was a luxury. He had to win over the hall.</p> <p>He did that by returning to what had been old form, staking out territory to the left of the Blairite project. Never mind that he had been the co-architect of New Labour, a favourite Brown manoeuvre was always to tickle the erogenous zones of the Labour faithful, serving up some old-time religion.</p> <p>Yesterday he did that by promising a \"new settlement for new times\", a shift to reflect the convulsions in the world economy. Now the market would be returned to its rightful place as a servant of the people - never its master. In a sentence which delighted his audience, he declared: \"Those who argue for the dogma of unbridled free market forces have been proved wrong.\"</p> <p>All week the conference fringe has hummed with similar sentiments, as Labour folk have seized on the collapse and bailout of the big banks as evidence that the neo-liberal era is over. Yesterday, Brown was keen to ride that wave.</p> <p>So he spoke of freeing agency workers from \"the scourge of exploitation\" and laid into the traders guilty of \"reckless speculation.\"</p> <p>That's not language that often passed the lips of Tony Blair. That it comes easily to Gordon Brown was one reason why he was able to remain as Labour's heir apparent for so long. Indeed, he turned to Red Gordon to get him out of trouble many times in the past and did so again yesterday.</p> <p>The politics are not hard to fathom. Brown hopes that by securing his left flank, he can cast himself as the more appealing alternative to any putative rival, who would swiftly be branded as \"Blairite\" and on the party's right. He knows that the trade unions are not impressed by David Miliband: in yesterday's speech Brown sent the message that in any future choice, they should stick with him.</p> <p>That was not the only way in which the he pushed back at those conspiring for his removal. The public \"would not forgive us\", he said, if Labour was to turn inward during the economic storm. This is proving to be one of Brown's sharpest weapons: the claim that to leave the country leaderless during such a crisis would spook the markets and anger the voters.</p> <p>But the moment that caught the attention - as it was surely designed to - was a line officially directed at the Conservatives but with a handy double meaning. \"I'm all in favour of apprenticeships,\" he said, \"but this is no time for a novice.\" The TV cameras instantly cut to Miliband's forced smile as the Brown camp knew they would.</p> <p>Not that the Tories escaped a pounding. Brown attacked them more potently than he has managed since becoming prime minister. He won gasps when he quoted George Osborne (not accurately it emerged later) declaring it was financial markets' job to make money out of the \"misery of others\".</p> <p>There was still some confusion on precisely how to attack the Tories: whether to accept that they have changed, conceding that they now have genuinely progressive intentions - but are not ready to support the means to those progressive ends - or whether to argue that the change is merely cosmetic. In the end, Brown did a bit of both.</p> <p>Still, this was more like the great clunking fist Brown had promised and which he had not yet bared. It gave Labour heart that, if Brown carried on like this, he might just rescue himself - and them.</p> <p>There were longueurs in the speech, especially in the middle, during what even his own aides described as \"the policy slab.\" And while he offered a sketch of what needed to be done to cure the global financial system, the speech was short on the domestic steps Brown plans to take. The policy proposals were all relatively small-bore: not quite lagging on pipes, but home internet and personal tutors for kids rather than an overhaul of the economy. </p> <p>Still, it's not on policy proposals that a speech such as this is judged. It's on the intangible, almost emotional sense that lingers once it's over. Brown needed to leave his audience with the gut belief that he's not done for just yet, that he could still come back. He did that yesterday. But it will have been for nothing if it ends there. As one cabinet colleague said, he needs to do that \"every day, every week from now on\".</p> <p>He has to kill off the man he has been for the last year - and bring back the Gordon Brown his party once dreamed of.</p>",
  "<p>Shell has become the first western oil company to win significant access to the energy sector in Iraq since the 1970s, in a $4bn move which could bring liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Britain.</p> <p>The deal has angered anti-war campaigners and senior Iraqi figures who complained yesterday that there was no competitive tendering for the contract.</p> <p>The Anglo-Dutch company said it had signed an agreement with the oil ministry in Baghdad to establish a joint venture with the South Gas Company in the Basra district of southern Iraq to process and market natural gas extracted on 19,000 sq km (7,300 sq miles) of land.</p> <p>\"Iraq has one of the world's largest natural gas resource bases and I am delighted that the Iraqi government, including the ministry of oil, have supported Shell as the partner for joint venture with the South Gas Company,\" said Linda Cook, executive director of Shell. </p> <p>The company will own 49% of the new Iraqi business which will collect some of the 700m cubic feet a day of gas produced by oil suppliers and \"flared off\" into the atmosphere - a practice condemned by environmentalists as contributing to global warming.</p> <p>Shell said its actions in Iraq would reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create value for the economy by providing the gas as a domestic power source.</p> <p>The combined operation, which will make use of the South Gas Company's 3,500 staff, would initially focus on local markets but Shell added that \"in the future the [joint venture] could develop a liquefied natural gas facility to export natural gas not needed for local domestic use\". </p> <p>LNG would be shipped to markets in the Mediterranean and further west, possibly Britain, according to well placed sources. Shell will not put a value on the deal but industry experts believe it could be worth $4bn in the short term at least. </p> <p>The first big contract signed by a western oil company since the invasion of Iraq was condemned by Platform, a British-based organisation which monitors oil companies and Iraq in particular.</p> <p>\"The big issue here is that the whole thing has been done in secret. We are not being told what the terms of the deal are - such as are there extension rights [for Shell to gain Iraqi reserves] and why has there been no competitive bidding process,\" said Greg Muttitt of Platform.</p> <p>\"What has definitely happened here is that a country under occupation has introduced an oil policy that is favourable to western oil companies. The [US] state department has already admitted that it has advisers working on oil policy and there is a likelihood they may have drafted the Shell contract.\"</p> <p>His views were reinforced by Issam al-Chalabi, Iraq's oil minister between 1987 and 1990, who questioned the lack of competitive tendering for the gas gathering contract and claimed it had gone to Shell as the spoils of war.</p> <p>\"Why choose Shell when you could have chosen ExxonMobil, Chevron, BG or Gazprom? Shell appears to be paying $4bn to get hold of assets that in 20 years could be worth $40bn. Iraq is giving away half its gas wealth and yet this work could have been done by Iraq itself,\" Chalabi said. </p> <p>He claims that his country spent $2bn in the 1980s putting a South Gas gathering project in place which was fully operational by 1990. A British vessel was loaded with LPG, he said, but the infrastructure was damaged in the first Gulf war and sanctions made it difficult to mend.</p> <p>\"Since 2003 nothing has been done to repair or replace compressor stations that were damaged. There were studies financed by Japan that showed how it could be done for a few hundred million dollars,\" Chalabi argued. </p> <p>Shell, BP and other oil majors are lining up for other big deals in Iraq with the oil ministry holding a meeting in London on October 13.</p>",
  "<p>I think I've heard him correctly. \"If you've never read it before, don't go for hard space opera.\" That is Peter F Hamilton's advice for people like me, who have never read science fiction and find its spaceships, hyperdrives and quantum fields utterly baffling. Hamilton is one of the most popular authors of \"space operas\" in Britain today, writing vast doorsteps of novels that combine fantastic speculation with incredibly detailed imagining of the lives we will lead some time after the 30th century. Is he saying his new book is not very accessible? \"Um, to somebody who has never ever read it [science fiction] before I would suggest I'm not your best first choice,\" he says disarmingly. Then he relents slightly. \"If you've enjoyed Battlestar Galactica, you should love my stuff,\" he says. And if you like whodunnits, he can recommend the Greg Mandel sci-fi/detective series that made his name.</p> <p>\"People are put off by the perception of science fiction,\" says Hamilton, \"and it doesn't help if you've got references to quantum this and quantum that on the first page, and people think 'this isn't for me' and chuck it. I'm probably a pretty bad offender, given how far in the future some of my stuff is. But there is that little jump you have to make if you haven't read it before.\"</p> <p>The number of people who love Doctor Who and Star Trek is, however, enormous. Hamilton, writing out of his shed in rural Rutland, is one of those authors who sells by the, er, shedload - 2m and rising - but rarely gets noticed beyond the sci-fi ghetto. His latest, The Temporal Void, is the middle book of his unfolding Void trilogy. I stupidly dived straight into it and found myself on another planet. It wasn't only the sentences - \"he'd simply stealthed up and dropped into hyperdrive. Now he was sitting in transdimensional suspension 10 light years out from Sholapur\" - but a profusion of terms like gaiafield, unisphere and u-shadow. More sensibly, I then went to the first in the trilogy, The Dreaming Void, and discovered that if you start from the beginning, Hamilton's storytelling is crystal clear. The sci-fi great Brian Aldiss has called space opera \"widescreen baroque\", and with a gigantic sweep of their keyboards, writers such as Hamilton create densely imagined future worlds riven with timeless human preoccupations - politics, religion, sex and money. Widescreen means big: writing while listening to Muse (Black Holes &amp; Revelations, naturally), Pink Floyd and Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells on his iPod, Hamilton churns out these huge tomes almost annually. His biggest trilogy, The Night's Dawn, weighed in at 1.2m words. The Void is more modest - at only 750,000.</p> <p>The void in question is at the heart of the Commonwealth, our universe in the 34th century. Alien races have been discovered, but life is still mostly a story of human struggle. Humans are stratified into highers, who have abandoned their bodies altogether to pursue an enlightened, mostly bodyless existence, and others who have thwarted ageing with genetic manipulation. But the biggest conflict has been created by the void at the centre of the universe. Based on the dreams of a messianic figure, a new religion has sprung up theorising that paradise can be found in this void. A pilgrimage is launched, but other human and alien factions take the more rational view that journeying into the void will trigger a \"devourment phase\", in which the void will swallow the entire universe.</p> <p>Hamilton believes a better term for sci-fi, or SF, is speculative fiction. \"In no way is it ever predictive,\" he says. Here, however, he has form: his first novel, written in the late 80s, was set 40 years into the future after catastrophic global warming and a \"credit crash\". Nevertheless, he feels his earlier work is \"creaking along now\", such is the pace of technological change. \"It's showing its age. My pride and joy at the time [of his first novel] was a cybofax. Because people had Filofaxes and personal computers were just coming in, I combined this into a book-sized thing with a colour screen and keyboard which you opened up. That was supposed to be set about 20 years from now! Hands up, I got caught out. It shows that near-term future is a lot harder than far-future.\"</p> <p>Hamilton, 48, who is married to an accountant and has two young children, grew up in Rutland. \"I love it dearly and it looks beautiful, but when you were a teenager in the 70s it was pretty dull,\" he says. \"So when I found the sci-fi shelf in the library it was a way out. We'd just had the moon landings and we were building the shuttle which was supposed to be going up once a week. I guess my generation was a littl e bit more optimistic. It's all doom and gloom these days.\" He enjoyed all the sci-fi classics - Isaac Asimov, Robert A Heinlein, Arthur C Clarke - but only began writing in his 20s when he quit work in London and returned to the county to help look after his sick mother. He writes, he says, for himself, as a sci-fi fan. \"If you're that 14-year-old stuck in a rut, it's great escapism, there are men with big guns and that kind of thing. But you could read it and see other stuff in there as well - religion and politics.\"</p> <p>Within his enormous imagined world, Hamilton breathlessly weaves together dozens of subplots and characters, from feisty female detectives to nerdy physicists. While there is plenty of adolescent fun and geeky dialogue - \"everyone's scared crapless\" - he devises all too recognisable political squabbles and imaginatively shows how the internet, for instance, might develop. Hamilton reads as much contemporary popular science as he can, and likes to extrapolate from the latest theories, but also keeps it simple: \"The hyperdrive is a black box with a button on that you press and it takes you where you want to go. Do not open the box and try to describe the circuitry inside. That's the basic rule in science fiction.\"</p> <p>Sci-fi enjoyed a golden age in the 1930s, when another rule was established - no sex. Hamilton's liberal lashings of shagging - in the Void books it is mostly of the shy-messiah-with-three-genetically-enhanced-beauties variety - have proved controversial in the sci-fi community. \"I've got a friend who writes a lot of chick lit. Compared to what goes into that genre we're absolute puritans, yet the reaction you get is 'Oh my God, it's a sex scene,'\" he says. Sex is a tiny part of his books. \"But you can't ignore it because that's part of what we are. We spend most of our lives in relationships or bringing up children which are a product of relationships.\"</p> <p>A timeless human preoccupation of more importance in the Void trilogy is religion. \"The whole point of science fiction is that you explore the effect of ideas on a society,\" says Hamilton. For centuries, religion's prime means of communication has been the written word. In the Void, the gaiafield, a kind of emotional internet through which people can directly share dreams and emotions, helps the emergence of a powerful new religion called the Living Dream. It is not inspired by one particular faith. \"It's an amalgamation of religions. It's the idea of religions - we and only we can provide the answer and we are right to do so, \" he says. \"The answer that Living Dream are going to provide will screw the rest of the galaxy but they think they have an absolute right to follow that goal. What religion is that not?\" </p> <p>Is Hamilton an atheist? \"I'm not quite an atheist but almost. There's a margin of error. There's a possibility. Not everything can be explained perfectly yet,\" he says. \"I don't believe in supernatural entities taking on human form and telling us how to live our lives, but it's a very grey area.\"</p> <p>It seems certain that Hamilton's latest offering from the Void will be another bestseller that evades the attentions of the literary establishment as effectively as any stealth ingrav ultradrive contraption. When a writer once dared to suggest to Auberon Waugh that the </p> <p>Literary Review should have a sci-fi column, he replied that the magazine already employed a sci-fi editor: their job was to ensure no sci-fi ever darkened its doors. Does this kind of snobbery bother him? \"It's irritating in the sense that we are shoved into a once-a-month roundup. If it's good or bad - I've been trashed many times by reviewers - or an interesting read, then it should be given a reasonable amount of exposure,\" he says. \"It's this segregation thing - people complain that it's on the science fiction shelf at the back of the bookshop, but then that's where people know to go and get it. It helps us and it frustrates us at the same time.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The Temporal Void is published by Macmillan on October 3.</p>",
  "<h2>Fishy business</h2> <p>Finfish News, incorporating the late, lamented Trout News, is a specialist journal from the shy Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas). It reports this month on a recent meeting in the UK of scientists from all over Europe \"to set a forward path for genomics in European Aquaculture\". \"Genetic technology is one of the key routes towards a stable and prosperous aquaculture industry in Europe,\" the magazine boldly states. Whoa! Someone should point out that the UK government's latest position on GM fish is that they are at present illegal, and that \"it is difficult to envisage any circumstances in which the release of a GM fish would be permitted\". That may have just changed. Cefas is a government body. </p> <h2>Tome for a rethink</h2> <p>What happens to hardline Thatcherite economists when they've taken redundancy from the Treasury, DTI or the Daily Mail? They end up becoming hardline climate change sceptics writing tosh for the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA)and getting visiting professorships at the University of Buckingham. The latest tome, from Ian Byatt, David Henderson, Russell Lewis, et al, is called Climate Change Policy: Challenging the Activists, and is remarkable, even by IEA standards, for its dullness and scientific illiteracy. Eco Soundings wonders if the authors, most of whom must be over 70, should rethink their outrage at society being asked to fork out about $25bn a year to tackle climate change, when it's costing governments several trillion dollars to tackle the dodgy bankers. </p> <h2>Royal flush</h2> <p>Tony Juniper has left Friends of the Earth, but now faces a tricky decision. The Green party is urging him to stand in one of its most promising seats in the next elections, and he is tempted. However, he is taking the Queen's - or rather her son's - shilling as an adviser to the Prince of Wales' rainforests project, and it would be hard to imagine him doing both jobs. The solution is simple: Eco Soundings urges Charles to have a word with mum and have Juniper ennobled immediately.</p> <h2>Boris buries big issue</h2> <p>Climate change used to be a very prominent part of the London mayor's website under Ken Livingstone. But now, if you go into the environment section, you find a sweet picture of a deer and some fluffy stuff about London's lovely parks. Boris Johnson claims that he is fully committed to delivering the Climate Change Action Plan, so it seems a tad strange that there's no mention of climate change whatsoever. Even the \"how to be green\" section doesn't mention climate change. To be fair, if you do a specific search for \"climate change\" on the site, much of the old content eventually comes up. But it is buried beneath a new facade, which we can only assume reflects the new administration's real aims, as it powers ahead with ideas for a climate-busting four-runway airport in the Thames estuary. </p> <h2>Cutting edge</h2> <p>The huge German chemical company BASF has been nominated as No 1 in the Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index - which means that it's the top corporate emission cutter. It gets the Eco Soundings cut-and-run award, too. In a barely noticed statement last month, it said it would cut all research into GM crops for the European market should it fail to get permission for its genetically engineered Amflora potato. \"Europe is not mission critical,\" says J\u00fcrgen Logemann, a vice-president at BASF's plant science division. \"If Europe doesn't work, we will do this without Europe.\" </p> <h2>Giant pander</h2> <p>John Hutton, the grandly-titled secretary of state for business, enterprise and regulatory reform, was pretty gung ho at the Labour party conference in Manchester this week, saying that not building new coal power stations would be \"pandering\". He implied that only a few green groups oppose new, unabated coal plants, although he should know that the opposition now comes from politicians of all parties, the investment sector, the Royal Society, international development groups, the RSPB, the Women's Institute, the Sustainable Development Commission, Environment Agency chair Chris Smith, energy experts, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers and, not least, the public. Indeed, the European Climate Foundation points out that Hutton himself seemed to be pandering to a very few special interest groups, such as a few thousand coal miners in the National Union of Mineworkers, the 84 members of the Association of Energy Producers, the German energy company E.ON, and one or two Daily Mail climate change contrarians.</p>",
  "<p>The South American republic of Ecuador will next week consider what many countries in the world would say is unthinkable. People will be asked to vote on Sunday on a new constitution that would give Ecuador's tropical forests, islands, rivers and air similar legal rights to those normally granted to humans. If they vote yes - and polls show that 56% are for and only 23% are against - then an already approved bill of rights for nature will be introduced, and new laws will change the legal status of nature from being simply property to being a right-bearing entity.</p> <p>The proposed bill states: \"Natural communities and ecosystems possess the unalienable right to exist, flourish and evolve within Ecuador. Those rights shall be self-executing, and it shall be the duty and right of all Ecuadorian governments, communities, and individuals to enforce those rights.\"</p> <p>Thomas Linzey, a US lawyer who has helped to develop the new legal framework for nature, says: \"The dominant form of environmental protection in industrialised countries is based on the regulatory system. Governments permit and legalise the discharge of certain amounts of toxics into the environment. As a form of environmental protection, it's not working. </p> <p>\"In the same way, compensation is measured in terms of that injury to a person or people. Under the new system, it will be measured according to damage to the ecosystem. The new system is, in essence, an attempt to codify sustainable development. The new laws would grant people the right to sue on behalf of an ecosystem, even if not actually injured themselves.\"</p> <p>Until now, all legal frameworks have been anthropocentric, or people-based. To file an environmental lawsuit requires a person to provide evidence of personal injury. This can be extremely difficult. To provide a conclusive link, say, between a cancer and polluted drinking water is, legally speaking, virtually impossible. </p> <p>The origins of this apparent legal tidal shift lie in Ecuador's growing disillusionment with foreign multinationals. The country, which contains every South American ecosystem within its borders, which include the Galapagos Islands, has had disastrous collisions with multi-national companies. Many, from banana companies to natural gas extractors, have exploited its natural resources and left little but pollution and poverty in their wake.</p> <p>Now it is in the grip of a bitter lawsuit against US oil giant Chevron, formerly Texaco, over its alleged dumping of billions of gallons of crude oil and toxic waste waters into the Amazonian jungle over two decades.</p> <p>It is described as the Amazonian Chernobyl, and 30,000 local people claim that up to 18m tonnes of oil was dumped into unlined pits over two decades, in defiance of international guidelines, and contaminating groundwater over an area of some 1,700 hectares (4,200 acres) and leading to a plethora of serious health problems for anyone living in the area. Chevron has denied the allegations. In April, a court-appointed expert announced in a report that, should Chevron lose, it would have to pay up to $16bn (\u00a38.9bn) in damages.</p> <p>Chevron, which claims its responsibilities were absolved in 1992 when it handed over its operations in Ecuador to the state-owned extraction company, Petroecuador, immediately set about discrediting the report. A verdict on the case is still thought to be a long way off, and Ecuador's government could face US trade sanctions for its refusal to \"kill\" the case.</p> <p>Environmental campaigner Zoe Tryon, of the Pachamama Alliance, which has worked closely with Ecuador's assembly, claims that the proposed new laws will make Ecuador's constitution \"the most progressive in the world\", and argues that such laws will prevent this situation from arising again. \"It's too late for the Chevron case, but it will be an effective deterrent for similar operations,\" she says.</p> <p>The laws would have particular relevance in the Yasuni national park, one of the world's most biodiverse areas and home to at least two \"uncontacted\" Amazonian tribes. It is also \"home\" to a possible 1.2bn barrels of untapped crude oil, which companies want to extract.</p> <p>\"The hope is that the new laws will give us unprecedented legal muscle to protect areas like this where there are competing interests,\" says Linda Siegele, a lawyer for the UK-based Foundation for International Environmental Law and Development. </p> <p>Linzey admits that Ecuador may be taking a step into the legal unknown. \"No one knows what will happen [if the referendum goes in favour of new rights for nature] because there are no examples of how this works in the real world,\" he says. \"A lot of people will be watching what happens.\"</p>",
  "<h2>Cities shaped by men</h2> <p>The Women's Design Service (WDS) recognises that a more diverse workforce is not the only key to creating healthy, happy communities and the environments in which people live and work (Opinion, September 17).</p> <p>Men comprise the vast majority of built environment professionals who create our urban spaces. WDS has campaigned for over 20 years for the recognition of gender differences in the design of our built environments.

We just don't think that \"discipline and punish\" regimes work, and nor do we think top-down approaches are the best way to deal with matters either.</p> <p>If local communities can take a lead in promoting acceptable behaviour on their own patches, within a framework of government measures, that is likely to be much more effective.

Under charity law, \"political\" is defined as seeking, or opposing, changes in the law or government policy. This is a core role for many charities, not just thinktanks.

  "<p>What is the best way to equip doctors for the demands of the 21st-century NHS? Most medical training happens in acute hospitals, where doctors learn on the wards, in operating theatres and casualty departments. Yet hospitals are not where the most common modern clinical conditions - depression, chronic disease, back pain - are treated or prevented.</p> <p>So, the argument goes, it is time for the focus of medical training to shift from the great teaching institutions to community units and polyclinics, where the real business of modern health practice happens. This is the proposal contained in the NHS London planning document, Workforce for London, published last week.</p> <p>The question asked by NHS London - and the Darzi review of the NHS that spawned it - is essentially this: do we need more doctors who can treat alpha one tripsy-dipsy deficiency, or do we need doctors who understand the mechanics of back pain, are skilled in prevention, and can advise whether a patient needs to see a surgeon, an Alexander technique therapist, physiotherapist or chiropractor?</p> <p>The London teaching and district general hospitals are the traditional seats of power of the medical establishment, and where the traditional medical models of disease are taught. Primary care trusts are already involved in postgraduate training, and they now have the opportunity to influence the selection of medical students and the way they are trained. This will produce a different type of doctor, one whose training is influenced by the communities he or she serves as much as by the traditional medical approach. It would be a shame if this opportunity to make medical education more relevant is blocked because doctors believe a shift towards preventive medicine reduces the value of their expertise. </p> <p>At present, medical training is outdated. Of a five-year curriculum, medical students might spend only eight weeks learning psychiatry, in a hospital setting. Yet depression is the greatest risk factor associated with heart disease after cigarette smoking, and forms a large part of consultations in general practice. In addition, the structure of hospital training is flawed: shift working and rapid turnover of patients in hospital have disrupted the traditional training model of hospital apprenticeship. This has led to a change from individual mentoring towards a tick-box style training, where different consultants separately supervise and sign up each item in a doctor's training log. This means that doctors cannot easily learn the tacit knowledge that is the backbone of any profession.</p> <p>Tacit knowledge comes from seeing conditions evolve over time, getting a feel for the many ways people respond to disease, and watching how they get better. Gaining tacit knowledge depends on those in the profession who are older and wiser getting to know and teach their juniors. Working in the community allows a doctor in training to get to know and work with experienced doctors in a way the hurly-burly of hospital medicine does not. Community medicine can provide the opportunity to see patients over time, and begin to understand their health difficulties as they relate to their environment and to their lifestyle.</p> <p>Workforce for London has the makings of a shift towards a local health service that provides the healthcare people want and need. It could be the way to ensure that the NHS educates and trains young professionals so they are, as the report puts it, \"aligned to explicitly meet service needs\". It could encourage the NHS to provide healthcare that prevents and treats 21st-century health conditions such as poor mental health, stroke and dementia.</p> <p>By enabling doctors and healthcare professionals to make a difference to the lives of their patients, it could revitalise a disillusioned and demoralised workforce.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Liz Miller is a GP and occupational health physician, specialising in health, mental health and psychology.

  "<p>Outside the Soviet Union, communist Poland was the strongest member of the Warsaw Pact, the Soviet-led alliance that bound eastern Europe between 1955 and 1991. The very name of the treaty underlined Poland's special role in it. Most Poles disliked Russian rule, but many thought that the Soviets at least could defend them and their newly gained western territories against the Germans.</p> <p>Today a new kind of Warsaw Pact emerges, this time with a strong anti-Russian and pro-US profile. Poland and the three Baltic republics - Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - harmonise their policy with regard to their status as super-ally to the US, their suspicion of Russia and their hidden frustration at \"soft\" European foreign policy. The Baltic leaders' journey to Tbilisi in August to show solidarity with Mikheil Saakashvili was the tip of the iceberg. These countries are the strongest supporters of Nato membership for Georgia and Ukraine; they heavily oppose the gas pipeline between Russia and Germany; they openly sympathised with the Chechen fighters against Russian rule.</p> <p>In domestic politics they also differ from the left-liberal consensus of western Europe. Homophobic policies, mixed feelings towards Jews, strong anti-left sentiments and denial of rights to ethnic minorities are common. The only distinction is their attitude to the second world war. Poland was a victim of Nazi Germany, while the Baltic rightwingers more or less openly say that the German occupation was no worse than the Soviet rule before and after the war.</p> <p>The ruling conservative parties of these countries firmly believe that the European Union is weak in the face of Russia. On foreign policy and security, only the Americans are reliable.</p> <p>Poland has an old ambition to become a regional power in central-eastern Europe, but these ambitions were sunk by the EU. Now the US offers similar status for Poland as its ally - and the US's missile defence shield, with the installation of American weaponry allegedly pointing at Moscow, marks the crowning of that mission. The most important characteristic of the new pact is super-loyalty to Washington in foreign policy and security affairs. They see the EU as an economic club, a source of support to subsidise agriculture and infrastructure. In their eyes the common environmental and social goals of the old member states (and the left parties in the new member states) are less important than the strong cross-Atlantic ties. </p> <p>As a member of the environmental committee of the European parliament, I haven't seen any serious involvement coming from the Baltic and Polish conservatives concerning environment, and the same goes for social issues. In this sense they are closest to Eurosceptic Britons, yet they rely on the financial support of richer EU members.</p> <p>Before making a judgment about this new informal alliance we have to try to understand its roots. The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact (1939) between Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia is still deeply imprinted on the spirit of the Polish and Baltic nations. If the Germans and Russians agree on something, their automatic response is suspicion and a desire to find a strong ally. Before the second world war, that ally was the UK and France, now it is the US. The Georgian war and the deployment of the missile shield merely strengthen this trend.</p> <p>Of course, there is a clear political imperative to enlarge this new pact. The Czech Republic is an obvious candidate, given its willingness to accept US missile radar equipment. However, the Czechs are not strong enough in their anti-Russian sentiments, and their society is too liberal and secular in the eyes of the Polish conservatives. Slovakia is traditionally rather pro-Russian: its premier Robert Fico even refused to recognise Kosovo independence. The next jewel would logically be Hungary. Former prime minister and leading opposition politician Viktor Orb\u00e1n is more than ready to join the Polish-Baltic group.</p> <p>However, he is still in opposition. The socialist PM of Hungary, Ferenc Gyurcs\u00e1ny, tries to keep a good relationship with Russia, which is not only the main gas and oil supplier of his country but an export market. The aim of the Hungarian socialists is to balance their loyalty to the US on security, their correct relationship with Russia, and their commitment to a would-be common European foreign policy. But as there is no such policy, it is not so easy for this small nation to resist the temptation to join the alliance of the pro-US and anti-Russian hawks.

  "<p>Government ministers, UN agencies and health officials will meet tomorrow as part of a big effort to slash the high mortality rate of women during childbirth.</p> <p>The talks, at the UN summit on the millennium development goals (MDG) in New York, will focus on persuading governments in poor countries to prioritise women's health.</p> <p>The UN estimates that half a million women die annually during pregnancy and childbirth and many more are disabled, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. Often the baby dies too, and if not, its survival, along with young siblings, is in jeopardy.</p> <p>MDG 5 aims to cut women's deaths in pregnancy and childbirth by 75% and MDG 4 is looking to reduce the deaths of under-fives by two-thirds. Of all the goals, these are the furthest off track.</p> <p>Sarah Brown, the prime minister's wife and patron of the White Ribbon Alliance, which campaigns to reduce maternal mortality, is expected to attend the conference. Brigid McConville, the charity's UK director, said: \"We have been garnering support, raising awareness and getting people, such as Sarah Brown, onside.\"</p> <p>Brown is optimistic that the UN meeting will move things on. \"Things are changing,\" she said yesterday. \"Progress is being made. Never before has this issue had so much support from so many. Women in childbirth made it into the G8 agenda for the first time in history this year.\"</p> <p>The UN claims the shortage of health workers is key to preventing women dying during childbirth. Dr Mubashar Sheikh, executive director of the UN's global health workforce alliance, said: \"In many African and Asian countries, mothers and babies are dying because all too often they do not have access to skilled health -workers - midwives, birth attendants, doctors, nurses. And yet this is something that can change.\"</p> <p>There is a global shortage of 334,000 midwives, according to the World Health Organisation. But that is not the whole problem. Many campaigners believe women get poor care in developingcountries because their status tends to be low.</p> <p>Claire Melamed, head of policy at the charity ActionAid, said the way to solve the problem in the long term was to get women more involved in how money is spent in developing countries. \"Education for women needs to improve and so does women's status in the home. Unless we recognise that as part of the problem, we won't make any progress,\" she added.</p> <p>Oxfam, which also campaigns on maternal mortality, said the main medical reasons why women die during childbirth were bleeding, infections, unsafe abortions and obstructed labour. But, said the charity, \"there is no doubt that women's inequality and over-representation among the world's poorest puts them at high risk\". There have been signs of progress in poorer countries recently. Sri Lanka and Malaysia have substantially reduced death rates in childbirth through improving healthcare systems. Nepal has nearly halved maternal deaths in the 10 years to 2006. In all three cases, the willingness of governments to prioritise women's health has helped to turn things around.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Friday September 26 2008</strong></p> <p> In the article below we said that Britain's ranking in a league table compiled by an anti-corruption group fell this year and that Ireland performed better than Britain. In fact the UK and Ireland share 16th place on Transparency International's 2008 Corruption Perceptions Index.</p> <p> </p> <p>People around the world believe that Britain has become a markedly more corrupt country, according to a league table published yesterday.</p> <p>Britain has slipped down the rankings of a table compiled yearly by the group Transparency International, following political scandals and the government's failure to prosecute over alleged bribery.</p> <p>The table is compiled each year by the global anti-corruption group, from polls taken around the world. The results are used to assess how much corruption is perceived to exist among public officials and politicians in 180 countries.</p> <p>Britain is now classed as the 16th cleanest country in the world, down from 12th in the previous year, and its worst performance since the league table was started in 1995. The survey shows that Denmark, New Zealand and Sweden are jointly perceived to be the least corrupt countries. Other countries performing better than Britain include Ireland, Germany and Norway. Somalia sits at the bottom of the table as the most corrupt, closely followed by Burma and Iraq. The executive director of Transparency International, Chandrashekhar Krishan, said it was \"probably no surprise\" that Britain's reputation had \"significantly worsened\". He said: \"Public confidence in political office has been eroded by the 'cash-for-honours' affair and the grudging exposures of MPs' expenses.\"</p> <p>Britain, he added, had a \"wretched and woeful record\" in prosecuting business executives for paying bribes to foreign politicians and officials to win contracts. </p> <p>He said this was epitomised by the government's decision to drop the police investigation into allegations that BAE, Britain's biggest arms company, paid bribes to Saudi royals. </p> <p>Britain's anti-bribery law has been criticised for being weak and antiquated. The Law Commission is due to publish fresh proposals in November and the business secretary, John Hutton, is promising a parliamentary bill to reform the legislation.</p> <p>Britain's only foreign bribery conviction since it signed a global anti-corruption treaty in 1997 was secured this week when Ananais Tumukunde, an adviser to the Ugandan president, was jailed for a year for receiving bribes from a British company director. But he was convicted under an old anti-corruption act dating from 1906, rather than a newer act passed seven years ago. </p> <p>Britain's record on foreign bribery will come under renewed scrutiny in October when the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, which enforces the 1997 convention, reports the outcome of its investigation into the UK's compliance with the treaty.</p> <p>The Department for Business defended the government's performance, saying: \"In many areas we go further than the requirements of the OECD anti-bribery convention.\" The spokesman added that there was an \"increasing number of UK investigations into foreign bribery, with 20 live cases and almost 50 preliminary enquiries ongoing\".</p> <h2>At a glance</h2> <p><strong>Least corrupt countries</strong></p> <p>1= Denmark</p> <p>1= New Zealand </p> <p>1= Sweden</p> <p>4 Singapore</p> <p>5= Finland</p> <p>5= Switzerland</p> <p><strong>Most corrupt countries </strong></p> <p>180 Somalia</p> <p>178= Burma</p> <p>178= Iraq</p> <p>177 Haiti</p> <p>176 Afghanistan</p>",
  "<p>The billionaire John Paulson was revealed yesterday as one of the hedge fund bosses who has been short-selling UK bank shares - placing a near \u00a31bn bet that their share prices would fall dramatically. </p> <p>His New York-based Paulson &amp; Co was last year's most successful hedge fund after it bet against the sub-prime mortgages that later turned toxic in the credit crunch. Paulson &amp; Co has placed bets on four high street banks, including HBOS, which was forced to agree a rescue takeover by Lloyds TSB last week after a precipitous collapse in its shares.</p> <p>Emergency rules rushed in by the Financial Services Authority to ban short selling in bank shares after the woes of HBOS yesterday unmasked Paulson &amp; Co as one of the funds betting on shares falling.</p> <p>Short sellers bet that share prices will fall by selling shares they do not own in the hope of buying them back more cheaply - hence making a profit.</p> <p>After last week's tumultuous stock market movements, the FSA ordered speculators to close down all short positions in bank shares within 24 hours or have their names made public. </p> <p>The FSA's surprise clampdown fuelled London's record-breaking stock market rise on Friday. But the three-month ban failed to arrest the decline in bank shares yesterday, with HBOS the biggest faller in the FTSE 100, losing 14% of its value.</p> <p>Paulson &amp; Co admitted to four short positions:</p> <p>\u00b7 0.87% of Royal Bank of Scotland worth \u00a3294m</p> <p>\u00b7 1.76% of Lloyds TSB worth \u00a3260m</p> <p>\u00b7 0.95% of HBOS worth \u00a393m</p> <p>\u00b7 1.18% of Barclays worth \u00a3258m </p> <p>The hedge fund was one of a handful which braved the new FSA regime and retained their short positions past Friday's deadline - leading to yesterday's disclosures of their bets to the stock market. </p> <p>Among the other dozen or so disclosures, Barclays Global Investors - owned by Barclays Bank - admitted taking a short position in St James's Place, a fund management group which is 59% owned by HBOS. Odey Asset management - run by Crispin Odey, who married into one of the families that founded Barclays - also admitted it was short in banking group Investec. The first fund to show its hand was Forteulus, based in London, which was short in London Scottish Bank.</p> <p>The disclosures of the short positions came amid further volatile trading on the market; bank shares were particularly hard hit by anxieties that the US authorities's $700bn plan to bail banks out of their toxic mortgage assets would be blocked by Congress. </p> <p>Bank shares were also knocked by figures from the British Bankers' Association showing the lowest level of mortgage approvals since records began in 1997 - 21,086 home loans were approved in August. The lenders blamed Alistair Darling for adding to the woes by causing uncertainty about whether stamp duty on homes was to be abolished. </p> <p>These pressures weighed particularly on the share price of HBOS - as did concerns that its takeover could fall apart.</p> <p>The value of the deal alters with the share price of Lloyds TSB and last night valued each HBOS share at 218p. In normal circumstances, HBOS shares would be near that level. But last night they closed at 188p.</p> <p>The unusually wide gap caused confusion in the City and led to suggestions market traders think the takeover has a lot of hurdles to cross and could yet fail. </p> <p>Leigh Goodwin, banks analyst at the stockbroker Fox Pitt Kelton, said: \"It's an unusual movement and it could be over concerns that there will be some block on the deal.\"</p> <p>Bradford &amp; Bingley was also sharply lower, falling another 12% amid continued speculation that it would need to find a buyer to provide a long-term solution to its business model. The hedge fund Steadfast admitted it was shorting the lender.</p> <p>Amid speculation that the FSA has been dusting down contingency plans in the event of further sharp falls in its share price, two ratings agencies downgraded their view on the bank.</p> <p>B&amp;B reiterated that its capital position was the strongest of the banks. After the stock market closed, it revealed it had taken action to stem losses caused by mortgages it bought from a financial services company owned by General Motors.</p> <p>Standard &amp; Poor's credit analyst, Nick Hill, said: \"The downgrade reflects our view that constraints on B&amp;B have increased materially in recent weeks, although liquidity is currently strong. At the heart of these problems is the likelihood that asset quality in B&amp;B's key products of self-certified and buy-to-let mortgages continues to weaken rapidly.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>Man Group</strong>, the world's biggest listed hedge fund, has come under renewed pressure following the ban on shorting financial shares announced by the FSA. Traders said the clampdown could hit Man's business, with analysts at Investec cutting their 2009 earnings forecasts by about 14% and their price target from 650p to 460p. But another reason for yesterday's fall was that Man is not on the FSA's list of 32 companies where shorting is prohibited, and is therefore a target for the bears. Man ended 35.5p lower at 398p.</p> <p>Other financial shares were weaker on doubts about the proposed $700bn (\u00a3382bn) bank bail-out announced by the US authorities. As Treasury secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke tried to persuade Congress to back the plan, Wall Street edged higher during UK trade, and helped London shares come off their worst levels. After falling as low as 5076.3, the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> closed down 100.1 points at 5136.1.</p> <p>The uncertainty about the effects of the plan, even if it gets the go-ahead, helped send UK banks lower. Mortgage providers fell sharply, after a 64% slump in home loan approvals in August. <strong>Bradford &amp; Bingley</strong>, which some believe may be next to lose its independence, fell 3.5p to 24.75p while <strong>HBOS</strong> - additionally unsettled by worries about whether its deal to be taken over by <strong>Lloyds TSB</strong> would go ahead - dropped 28.8p to 180.2p. Lloyds lost 13.25p to 261.75p.</p> <p>Some dealers suggested Friday's record rally could have been at least partly driven by investors scurrying to buy shares to cover their short positions rather than having to disclose them by yesterday's FSA deadline. A number of disclosures did emerge, including news Barclays Global Investors had a 0.37% short position in <strong>St James's Place</strong>, the wealth management group 59% owned by HBOS. St James's was steady at 260p.</p> <p>Miners fell as commodity prices slid. Copper lost around 3% on profit taking amid the Paulson plan worries, helping push <strong>Vedanta Resources</strong> 177p lower to \u00a315.27. <strong>Anglo American</strong> lost 191p to \u00a321.36, while <strong>Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation</strong> shed 78.5p to 608p. But <strong>UK Coal</strong> rose 8.75p to 372.25p after positive noises on the sector from business secretary John Hutton at the Labour Party conference on Monday. Utility groups were in demand, with <strong>International Power</strong> 8.5p better at 364p as Citigroup moved from hold to buy, and <strong>Centrica </strong>climbing 4.5p to 330.5p.</p> <p>Zambia-based miner <strong>Kiwara</strong> jumped 60% to 24p after finding a high-grade nickel deposit at its Kawoko site, while software group <strong>Seeing Machines</strong> rose 5.5% to 2.375p on a maiden full-year profit. But stem cell storage firm <strong>Cryo-Save</strong> dived 56.5p to 66p after warning 2008 results would miss their target. </p> <p>'With the turmoil in the financial sector, investors looked to defensive stocks. Consumer goods group Unilever was one company to benefit from this trend'</p> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/markets\">blogs.theguardian.com/markets</a></p>",
  "<p>Christopher Dodd, the Democrat who chairs the Senate banking committee, is right: Hank Paulson's $700bn (\u00a3380bn) bail-out is \"stunning and unprecedented in its scope and lack of detail\".</p> <p>The most important missing detail is the price at which the US treasury would buy mortgage assets from the banks. Paulson spoke about using \"different types of market-based auction procedures\", but offered little explanation beyond that.</p> <p>You can understand why Dodd &amp; co are suspicious. The price at which assets are mopped up will determine whether the US taxpayer gets a good or bad deal. ING's Mark Cliffe put his finger on the problem: \"Low prices would compound the banks' agony, high prices would cost the taxpayer.\"</p> <p>Finding a line between those difficulties is critical. If prices are set low, banks will be pushed into fresh write-downs and again find themselves looking for new capital. If prices are set high - if the taxpayer is landed with a bigger bill than $700bn - the dollar could come under pressure. There would be a disincentive for foreign investors to keep capital flowing into the US. Their faith in the US economy's powers of revival would have to be deep.</p> <p>Maybe the middle path really exists. But Paulson's sales pitch yesterday comprised little more than a warning that the consequences of inaction would be dire. He may well be right, but you can understand why the market's view of the plan veers between wild enthusiasm and scepticism. At the moment, we simply don't know whether banks' balance sheets will be stronger or weaker as a result of the bail-out. Worse, the picture won't necessarily be clearer once the plan is approved - assuming it is.<br><strong><br>Hedges trimmed</strong></p> <p>In theory, this ought to be hedge funds' finest hour. Until last week, they could bet freely on falling share prices. Given their proximity to the investment banks, they had a front-row seat to observe the financial crisis. They can ride the momentum in the commodities markets - up then down, with little messing about in the middle, has been this year's story. </p> <p>They can play the foreign exchange markets, where other big themes have been clear. Sterling at $2 in July? Everybody knew that was a sell - it has been for the past 25 years.</p> <p>Yet the hedge fund industry as a whole has lost about 3.3% of investors' capital this year, according to data provider Eurekahedge. Stockmarkets have fared worse, but hedge funds sold a story of \"absolute returns\" - in other words, their investment performance would be positive, whatever the financial weather.</p> <p>The picture is even poorer for investors who preferred to spread risk by paying a portfolio manager to invest in a range of hedge funds. Fund-of-funds, as they are called, have returned minus 6.4%, according to Eurekahedge. That's not Eureka! - it's Yikes!</p> <p>Now two further threats to hedge funds have appeared. First, the ban on shorting financial stocks is only temporary, but emergency measures have a habit of becoming permanent. If a long/short hedge fund can't go short, it's a long-only fund - the world is awash with them, and they don't charge princely management fees of 2% plus 20% of the profits.</p> <p>Second, adding financial leverage - or juicing up returns with the use of debt - is yesterday's game. There is a feeling that hedge funds' poor performance this year is partly the result of their need to reduce leverage. If so, you would expect investors to start withdrawing their cash because leverage isn't coming back.</p> <p>Clearly, there will always be demand for excellent stock-pickers and fund managers who can make money by anticipating global economic shifts. But the impression left by this year's dismal performance statistics for the industry as a whole is that there are too many hedge funds in the world pursuing similar strategies.</p> <p>Nouriel Roubini, economics professor at the Stern School of Business, writing in the FT the other day, predicted a \"massive shake-out of the bloated hedge fund industry\". People have been saying that for years. This time they're right.<br><strong><br>Short mystery<br></strong><br>Now we know: only a dozen or so hedge funds currently have short positions in UK financial stocks. But what can we read into this? Next to nothing. We don't know how many took off their positions on Friday in order to beat the Financial Services Authority's deadline for disclosure. Did the majority of short-sellers scarper in order to avoid publicity?</p> <p>Or perhaps shorting financial stocks had become a dangerous game even before the FSA's clampdown. Anybody with a short position in Merrill Lynch was burned by the Bank of America takeover. To a lesser degree, those betting on a fall at HBOS were hurt by the Lloyds TSB bid. The great short-selling mystery will have to remain a mystery. <br><a href=\"mailto:nils.pratley@theguardian.com\"><br>nils.pratley@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "<p>Almost 56 years after Al Martino topped the first singles chart with Here in My Heart, the company behind the weekly rundown has unveiled a shakeup designed to maintain its relevance in the broadband age.</p> <p>The Official Charts Company (OCC) hopes the addition of an official \"subscription plays chart\" will help future-proof it as the music industry chases new revenue models. The new chart, believed to be the first of its kind, will measure the number of times individual tracks are played on the new type of service record label chiefs hope will rescue them from digital piracy and a slump in CD sales. </p> <p>The chart will measure how many times songs are played by those who subscribe to \"all you can eat\" offerings from companies such as Napster, the Vodafone MusicStation service operated by Omnifone, HMV and the Nokia Music Store. </p> <p>For a monthly fee, they offer subscribers unlimited access to millions of tracks. The subscription model has been slow to take off while record labels have resolved rights and licensing issues, but it is now expected to explode in popularity. </p> <p>After signing a memorandum of understanding with ISPs to try to clamp down on illegal downloading, record labels will collaborate with them to launch services that will bundle access to millions of tracks with a monthly broadband or mobile phone subscription. </p> <p>BSkyB plans to launch a subscription service combining a \"global jukebox\" with a set number of songs that can be downloaded and kept for a monthly fee. It has already signed a deal with Universal, home of U2 and Amy Winehouse, and expects to agree deals with the other big labels. </p> <p>Later this year Finnish handset giant Nokia will launch Comes With Music, which offers unlimited music for one year, bundled with a mobile phone, for a one-off fee of between \u00a3100 and \u00a3300. Industry analysts also expect Apple's market leading iTunes Music Store to introduce a subscription offering at some point. </p> <p>Rob Lewis, chief executive of Omnifone, which operates the MusicStation service for Vodafone, said: \"As the international music market evolves, consumers will come to expect subscription-based unlimited music services as part of their digital music experience.\" </p> <p>The OCC's managing director, Martin Talbot, said: \"In the past we have basically counted individual sales of tracks, albums and other physical kinds of products. The music industry will be able to use [the chart] to promote legitimate use of music subscription services.\"</p> <p>He said any discussions to merge the new subscription chart into the existing singles chart remained \"a long way off\". </p> <p>The singles chart, which had been hit hard by heavy discounting, marketing stunts and declining sales, has received a shot in the arm thanks to the inclusion of download sales two years ago.</p> <p>By the end of 2007 weekly download sales were averaging 2m units, making it the third best year for singles sales on record in the UK, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. A rule change that allowed tracks to chart even if there was no accompanying physical release has also allowed songs to climb the charts in a more organic fashion. </p> <p>Talbot said this year total sales were likely to top 100m for the first time. </p> <p>The new subscription plays chart includes many of the same tracks as the official singles chart, but with some important differences that are likely to become more pronounced as they gain in popularity.

  "<p>A 36-year old former RAF pilot and his financial backers have placed the biggest ever order for Learjets - worth $1.5bn (\u00a3815m) - in the belief that the global credit crunch will not affect high net worth individuals and their need to travel around the world on private aircraft.</p> <p>Jonathan Breeze, chief executive of the newly launched Jet Republic, has placed an order for 110 Bombardier Learjet 60XRs which will provide customers with airborne internet connections for their BlackBerry mobile phones, special security systems and multilingual flight attendants. </p> <p>Breeze, who claims his company offers \"a five-star boutique hotel in the sky\" believes that the banking crisis could work in his favour and he says the company is quite different from airlines such as Silverjet, EOS and Maxjet that catered for the business community and which have all ceased trading this year. </p> <p>He believes some successful entrepreneurs and high-net worth individuals could ditch plans to buy their own jets and buy space on his craft which will fly to more than 1,000 airports in Europe. The company, which will be based in Lisbon, is promising to use offsetting to ensure carbon-neutral travel. </p> <p>\"The kind of customers we cater for will be continuing to run their businesses around Europe and could find themselves wanting to use private jets as the main airlines cut routes and services,\" said Breeze, the Jet Republic chief executive, who flew huge Hercules transport planes for the RAF before moving into commerce.</p> <p>\"We have obviously been following the credit crunch but our opinion is that some people might drop plans to invest $15m to $20m on their own private business jet and come to us.\" </p> <p>Despite the squalls hitting the mainstream civil aviation sector due to rising fuel costs and lower demand, Jet Republic argues that between 1998 and 2007 there was an 83% increase in the number of business jet flights and a more than 50% increase in the last four years of that period. The new business is backed by an Austrian private bank, Euram, and Mexico's Grupo Salinas plus a number of undisclosed individual investors. It is to be located in Lisbon, says Breeze, because that is a main centre for the private jet sector. \"We found ourselves twice oversubscribed. They [financial backers] realise that this is a growing market.\" </p> <p>Bob Horner, senior vice president for sales at Bombardier Business Aircraft, said the private jet market was going from strength to strength despite the global economic downturn. </p> <p>\"In fact, Business Aircraft Market Forecast predicts $300bn in deliveries over the next 10 years. Bombardier estimates that the worldwide business jet fleet will nearly double in the next ten years from 12,800 to 24,800 in 2017.\" </p> <p>Britain is expected to supply some customers - and many of Jet Republic's staff. As many as 550 pilots, 350 flight attendants and up to 700 back-up staff will be needed to keep the 110 Learjets in the air and Breeze expects some of his former colleagues to sign up.</p> <p>Jet Republic says it will be 100% carbon neutral from its very first flight. It has signed an agreement with ClimateCare, one of Europe's most experienced providers of carbon offsets.</p> <p>Breeze, who was a director of private jet company NetJets Europe and White Concierge before helping to establish Jet Republic, said his new venture would deliver gold-plated services in the sky - and on the ground. </p> <p>\"Our bespoke concierge service doesn't just offer our members an end to end travel itinerary - it goes beyond this.

  "<h2>Yes</h2> <p><strong>Ian Phillips</strong><br>Director of business affairs for F1 team Force India </p> <p>Ensuring formula one is a truly global sport by expanding into the Middle and Far East is a good thing. It is not so much a commercial decision - the benefits will not become apparent for a good many years, if ever, in terms of what it does for the sport. We have been going to Malaysia for 10 years and there's no discernible commercial gain out of going there; we have been going to China for four years yet you can't see that anything has dramatically changed in terms of revenue or the popularity of the sport there.</p> <p>We're going to a lot of places that don't have a culture of motor sport and it takes a minimum of five years for any event to establish itself. Only once that has happened can the sport begin to establish itself within that country, develop a fan base and grow from the bottom up. We have got to take a very, very long-term view on the move into these countries - it certainly will not bring immediate riches in terms of attracting new investment or sponsors. Maybe there will be a dribble, but that will scarcely be obvious.</p> <p>Admittedly, the sport as a whole certainly does benefit in that countries pay F1 to go there because it provides international exposure for the country and the city. Teams, of course, then benefit from the distribution of increased income for the commercial rights holders from television revenue.</p> <p>Globally, new circuits in the East give us a far wider spread which is good for the sport. Of course we don't want to lose the traditional heartland in Europe, the great circuits like Spa in Belgium or Monaco but we cannot perform for nothing in a sport that is vastly expensive to compete in.</p> <p>On today's business model then the direction the sport is moving in, <br>towards ensuring long-term growth and an increase in revenue, is the right one. We have got to go to countries who want to pay handsomely for us being there.</p> <p>Singapore this weekend is going to be fantastic because for the sport and the fans, street circuits are great. It's very expensive both to put on, and to watch, a track grand prix. When it's on a street circuit, you can get far more fans in around the streets, right up close to the action than you can when asking them to make a journey all the way to a track like they had to at Silverstone. And generally on street circuits racing is more exciting. Racing through the streets of a city has always been an exhilarating spectacle in formula one.</p> <p>Whether night racing will be a success is the big unknown. Our team manager went out there eight weeks ago and was shown track lighting five or 10 times more powerful than at a Premier League football stadium, so you would think it will be bright enough. It's going to be an interesting balance, though, between getting the track sufficiently lit for the drivers and making sure it doesn't distort the background. The unique setting of the skyscrapers and marina need to be visible. We don't want to lose the very reason we're going there.</p> <p>And the move to circuits around the world that are able to combine the very best facilities with breathtaking backdrops will continue. Glamorous locations are what formula one sells itself on. And I'm afraid tracks on former WWII aerodromes do not give the sport that glamorous image.</p> <h2>No</h2> <p><strong>Sir Jackie Stewart</strong><br>Three-time world champion and former BRDC president Formula one has been international from the beginning. The official world championship, the first ever grand prix, took place at Silverstone in 1950. There were four reasons that race took place: Britain, and, in no particular order, Italy, Germany and France. A vast amount of technology and participation in the sport has come out of these countries through the car companies involved. The industry that deals with the technology used and developed in formula one is still mainly based in Europe. Engineers come from all over the world to benefit from our expertise.</p> <p>New countries come and go on the calendar but the four founding members have always been there. There may be a new world in formula one that comprises Asia and the Pacific but you cannot forsake the foundations of the sport by suddenly taking grands prix away to countries who afford the enormous cost with government help.</p> <p>Staging a grand prix is now almost beyond a normal promoter because you cannot profit from the race. It is the governments of countries in Malaysia, China, Singapore and Australia who are supporting them. The French government is no longer subsidising their grand prix and there are fears it will disappear, which would be wrong. In this country, you can see how the government has supported sport by the number of medals won in Beijing - but the investment was colossal. In cricket, millions were invested a few years ago; motor sport has had zero. Maybe there's something wrong there because we have an industry that is producing considerable benefit to the economy. Britain is the capital of motor sport, employing around 50,000 people in the motor sports industry.</p> <p>Tradition does play a role in F1 and we have got to stand by it. You can't just walk away from the creators of the sport when those countries are still able to put on safe grands prix with great racing and a wide attendance. America did not host a grand prix this year, which is not right when you consider it is such a market-place for the world.</p> <p>Of course, the flip side of that is the commercial nature of the sport. There is more capital investment in formula one than any sport in the world. And we are talking about giant corporations here, not just the car companies. They are not just sponsoring the cars, but they are involved in circuit advertising and title sponsorship for these events. Financial services companies like RBS lead the way - they are one of the five biggest banks in the world - and then you have Santander, Credit Suisse and ING. All of them are global players who like the idea of going to places like Singapore to tap into a world audience. But there shouldn't be a situation where you can leave your roots; it is no good trying to build up a sport without its foundations.</p> <p>The night race is another attempt to put a different spin on the sport and move it forwards. There used to be a rule where you would have to have another race in a senior formula to prove that the organisation and the safety all worked well, but that no longer exists. I haven't seen the street circuit at Singapore but the success of any new track depends on the design. The race in Valencia on a street circuit didn't produce great close racing. But we had a fantastic race at Monaco on a circuit that is part and parcel of the sport's heritage.</p>",

  "<p>Have there been two parallel conferences in Manchester this week? One conducted under the glare of TV lights in the main conference hall, all sweetness and harmony; the other, awash with fraternal spite and leadership speculation in the bars and corridors of the conference fringe?</p> <p>At one level, yes. There always are parallel conferences in every party, especially when the great unmentionable elephant - an unpopular leader - is in the corner and no one knows what to do about it. </p> <p>Gordon Brown's second conference as Labour prime minister displays some such features, though it has not proved a vintage plotters' year by past standards. Yesterday's speech was good enough to squash it - for now.</p> <p>Much more lurid speculation was once directed at Tony Blair, IDS, John Major, Margaret Thatcher, all the way back to Churchill's stroke in 1953. Would the old man's Tory conference speech in Margate be so bad he would be forced out? He got away with it.</p> <p>By accident or design, this year's plot was outed a week before the conference. A small but vocal group of MPs called for an early leadership contest and did not win much support. As global financial markets crumbled Brown got a respite. </p> <p>Some colleagues report that rebel MPs such as Siobhain McDonagh and Barry (\"forestry envoy\") Gardiner have been cold-shouldered by delegates at fringe meetings in Manchester, pawns sacrificed in a bigger game which has some cabinet support. </p> <p>Quite how much is uncertain. Last week's pre-conference cabinet was described as \"hell\" by one participant, \"bizarre\" by what may have been another. Others rejected the description. We are united on policy and faction-free, Jack Straw said yesterday. Not quite: some ministers have been more loyal to Gordon on TV than in private. But no ex-cabinet big beast raised the standard of revolt on the conference fringe, as the Hezzas and Tebbits routinely did during the years of Tory turmoil. Most fringe meetings stuck to their agenda: health, schools, climate change. The Blairite Progress rally was noisily loyal. Even Charles Clarke was a damp squib. </p> <p>Nor did ministers or union bosses air their differences at the conference rostrum as they did in Labour's 1970s Bennite battles. David Miliband's speech wisely played it safer than Brown used to do when he was railing as \"Real Labour\" against Blair.</p> <p>So ordinary delegates, mostly loyal, not fixated by the media gossip, were left bemused. Not only have they seen Brown, relaxed and cheerful, at receptions, but the plots they read in the papers - or hear about on TV (plot pictures are rare) - are also at odds with the wholesome tone of the hall. </p> <p>That highlights another set of parallel conferences: between insiders and outsiders. Columnists and political editors who hobnob with senior ministers and officials at conference hotel parties (or eavesdrop in lifts) are part of the inside track. Mistrusted but manipulated and manipulative in turn, they are disliked by delegates for ignoring the official good news agenda.</p> <p>Yet it could have been so much worse. Fresh policy announcements have been in short supply here. Wall Street filled the news vacuum. Unease over Brown remains, but New Labour's fabled discipline held.</p>",
  "<p>He clunked and he frowned and he sometimes smiled, and he defied all- comers. Labour and Tory could do their worst but he would not move. Gordon Brown yesterday did exactly what his fair-weather friends should have expected of him. He refused to give an inch to the merchants of political manoeuvre. This hugely serious man summoned up his powers of Presbyterian oratory and declared simply: \"There is a lot to be serious about.\" The stag is finest when at bay.</p> <p>Brown should never have become prime minister, and there is hardly a creature in the political jungle who does not know it - and precious few who did not know it a year ago. Only Tony Blair's 1994 pact with the devil made it inevitable, thus ensuring that his fidgety, insubstantial era would end in tears.</p> <p>A decade at the Treasury took a terrible toll on Brown's capacity for passion. Earlier this month, when a nation was avid for his \"leadership relaunch\", he hit it with cavity-wall insulation grants. He is now set on reinvigorating his poll support with educational technology allowances and free theatre tickets, broadband and circuses.</p> <p>Yet there was no sign yesterday of the moody, defeatist misery that the prime minister has appeared to be immersed in over recent months. Brown went to inordinate lengths to heed his critics. He avoided lists and was almost Blairite in his \"yunnos\" and levity of detail. His theme was that old cliche, a fair society, and even his specifics were abstract. The financial crisis is to be countered not with policies but with a \"new global settlement\", involving transparency, soundness, integrity and standards. There was even a canter round the old \"duties and responsibilities\" track.</p> <p>If Brown overdosed on platitude, at least it could be self-referential and pointed: \"My children aren't props, they are people\", \"I didn't go into politics to be popular - perhaps just as well\", and \"I'm all in favour of apprenticeships but let me tell you this is no time for a novice\" (whether directed at George Osborne or David Miliband was not clear). Nor was there any engagement with the minutiae of foreign affairs. This must surely be the first prime minister in time of war never once to discuss or justify it to his party conference.</p> <p>Brown has now to perform the task he yesterday set himself, to show the British people that the custodian of economic collapse \"can be the rock of fairness and stability on which they can depend\". This crudely means turning a world financial crisis to his advantage - to be what the 19th-century political scientist Max Weber called an \"occasionalist\".</p> <p>Weber's perfect leader seizes on any and every passing event and bends it to his will. Blair, like Margaret Thatcher, could take a royal death, a terrorist bomb, a war, even a recession, and somehow use it as a prop for his own position. He would have taken the current crisis as a sign of a global threat from dark satanic forces and pleaded with the nation to place its savings in his hands. Somehow it would have worked, for a while.</p> <p>Brown last year was granted both a bomb and a flood, and has now been given a recession. Yet occasionalism is not bred in his bone. For all his claim of \"new challenges\", he is still vulnerable to the charge that claiming credit for a financial boom involves accepting blame for a crash. Even as he adopts the language of charismatic conviction, Brown is easiest with that of cavity-wall insulation and broadband vouchers.</p> <p>The prime minister's supporters last year lauded a return to high seriousness in British politics, and an end to spin and gimmick. He has given them high seriousness in spades. To turn his back on the new politics of charm is a gamble, but it is simply the only gamble he knows. There is to be no song-and-dance act, no Auld Lang Syne, about this political recovery, just a long hard slog.</p> <p>He has at least been lucky in the tactical ineptitude of his opponents. It is a mystery what advantage there was to David Miliband - his claim to the succession acknowledged - in prancing about Manchester like Prince Hal trying on the crown. His admitted mimicking Michael Heseltine at Tory conferences in the 1980s was positively ghoulish, given Brown's tribulation: the straying beyond his ministerial brief, the damning of the leader with faint praise, the availability to every photographer and fringe meeting.</p> <p>Brown knows these tricks, since he used to torment Blair in much the same way. Perhaps he should remember Blair's great error, in failing to punish a man so blatantly styling himself his successor. Miliband suddenly looks foolish and vulnerable.</p> <p>The Labour leader is a big beast who is not going to go quietly. Blair's constitutional reform ensured that any toppling would be bloody, and probably require a split in the party's upper echelon. This would increase calls for a swift general election, at which the party would be devastated. The only MPs stupid enough to want that are ones whose seats are safe, and there are few of those at present.</p> <p>Politics always goes mad at conference time. It is when public affairs take a back seat and ambition removes its disguise. Thatcher almost fell at such a moment in 1981. She was in the depths of a recession and fiercely unpopular among senior colleagues, convinced that she was going to lose them the next election. Alan Clark recalled that there is nothing that drives Westminster delirious quite like insecurity at the top. At the scent of blood in the water, the sharks glide towards it, circling for the kill. It is the survival of the fittest.</p> <p>There is time and tide enough to pass between now and the formal end of this parliament in 2010. Tail-end leaders often do unexpectedly well at the polls. Douglas-Home almost won in 1964 after 13 years of Tory rule. John Major won an unprecedented popular vote after a similar span in 1992. Neither was an exciting or popular leader. Who knows but Brown, too, may find 13 years his electoral lucky number.</p> <p>Either way, he yesterday showed no sign of being a man who feels his job is finished or his ambition spent. He plainly expects those who queued sycophantically at his door just a year ago to stick with him in his time of trouble. He will now get that support. He knows that Labour is good at sadism, but terrible at murder.<br><a href=\"mailto:simon.jenkins@theguardian.com\"><br>simon.jenkins@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>By forcing out President Thabo Mbeki so vindictively, the <a href=\"http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?doc=lists/ancnec.html&amp;title=ANC+NEC\">ANC leadership</a> may have to sacrifice Jacob Zuma, the party leader, to prevent a backlash that could break up the party ahead of next year's general elections. </p> <p>Today \u2013 as expected \u2013 a third of Mbeki's cabinet <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/23/southafrica.mbeki1\">resigned</a> in anger with the way he has been treated, deepening the biggest political crisis since South Africa became democratic in 1994. Since Mbeki's resignation on Sunday, Zuma had pleaded with Cabinet ministers not to resign \u2013 with limited success. Some ANC leaders have said they will form their own party, to challenge a Zuma-led ANC in next year's general election. This shows the extent of the dissatisfaction among the ANC rank-and-file, even those who have been traditionally critical of Mbeki, who had only four months left on his presidential term. Other ANC members are now planning mass protests across the country. The only way to unify the ANC is not to have Zuma president of South Africa, and make <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/22/southafrica4\">Kgalema Motlanthe</a>, the caretaker president, the permanent candidate. </p> <p>Zuma may be popular, and have a hardcore, loud and militant support base who are prepared to \"die\" to have him president, but at the same time, a large proportion of the ANC's membership disapprove of him with equal gusto. They are unlikely to vote for the ANC when he is the presidential candidate. For the ANC to think that Mbeki's forced exit will \"unify the party\", as ANC general secretary <a href=\"http://news.my.msn.com/topstories/article.aspx?cp-documentid=1687408\">Gwede Mantashe</a> said when he announced Mbeki's sacking, is to be in denial, the favourite response to crises, of the very man they ousted. </p> <p>It is unlikely that those who determinedly moved to oust Mbeki understood the significance of what they have done. They have unleashed a political hurricane, which they cannot control. Mbeki was fired by the Zuma group in charge of the ANC, because they feared he would set up a commission investigating corruption related to the controversial arms deal, in which Zuma is implicated, or recharge him. Zuma has 16 charges of corruption against him. Judge Chris Nicholson, who cleared Zuma on a technicality, emphasised he did not give a verdict on the charges, but proposed the prosecutors recharge Zuma, provided they do so by following the proper procedures. The prosecutors have been under such an attack from the Zuma camp now that their very credibility may rest on recharging Zuma. In any event, they know that if Zuma comes to power, the prosecuting unit may be broken up. Furthermore, a number of private prosecutions against Zuma have been lined up \u2013 so it is difficult to see how Zuma is going to extricate himself out of the very real criminal charges, which have already seen his former financial advisor sent to jail for 15 years. </p> <p>Following Mbeki's forced exit, the Zuma coalition, consisting of five distinctly different groups, who were all opposed to Mbeki, have lost the glue that held them together \u2013 opposition to Mbeki. Furthermore, with Mbeki gone, all of them are now focusing on securing their own interests in the leadership vacuum. Within the Zuma coalition, not all are set on securing the presidency of South Africa for Zuma. Those who are include: the <a href=\"http://70.84.171.10/~etools/anc/youth/index.php\">ANC youth league</a>, the pro-Zuma black economic empowerment business oligarchs \u2013 both hoping to secure patronage; the communist party (SACP) and the trade unionists (Cosatu), who nave no alternative presidential candidate of their own, think they can manipulate Zuma in power; and those ANC leaders who are being investigated by the national prosecuting authority for corruption, because, they argue that if Zuma's case is quashed \u2013 especially when he comes to power, theirs will also. </p> <p>Now the Zuma coalition are divided between those who want Zuma at all costs to become president, such as those seeking a pardon for corruption or patronage, versus those who are prepared to look for a unifying ANC leader that will be pro-poor \u2013 the latter include the more serious elements of Cosatu and the SACP. Yet, Zuma is not entirely in control of his own coalition: rather they may actually be in charge of him. He opposed efforts to oust Mbeki, because he feared he will inherit a divided party, unprepared to run a general election. However, he was rudely overruled by his own militants. Furthermore, in the week when Mbeki detractors within the Zuma coalition moved to oust him, all the old presidential rivals of Mbeki, Cyril Ramaphosa, Mathews and Tokyo Sexwale, again took centre stage within the ANC, dwarfing Zuma, almost like a decade ago. </p> <p>Until yesterday, the Zuma camp, in control of the ANC had planned to appoint <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/19/southafrica1?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=worldnews\">Baleka Mbete</a>, the speaker of parliament, and the ANC's chairwoman, and a more pliable supporter, as interim president, to smooth the way for Zuma and to create an environment for Zuma's legal charges to be withdrawn. However, Motlanthe's elevation as interim president shows that divisions with Zuma's coalition are now deepening. Motlanthe was the choice of those in the Zuma coalition who are more interested in keeping the ANC united, and securing a pro-poor government focus, rather then putting Zuma into the presidency. They have long seen him as an alternative candidate for the presidency if Zuma stumbles over his legal hurdles. Motlanthe does things by the book. Motlanthe is also one of the few ANC leaders with support in both the Mbeki and Zuma camps. Zuma rightly perceives him as a serious rival. </p> <p>In this crisis, there may be openings for other young Turks of Motlanthe's generation. To contain the young Turks \u2013 Motlanthe, Phosa, Sexwale and Ramaphosa, Zuma has promised to stay as president for one term only, and then allow a competitive election for the leadership between them. But Mothlante will now have inside track, because he is already an MP, while the others, including Zuma are not. He will be presiding president for six months, which is enough to show his credentials not only as a unifying figure, but a source of new ideas, energy and principle, and to contrast this to the divisive potential of a populist Zuma. </p> <p>It will be ironic if it takes the ANC to go through such a destructive process, if it eventually get some sense and appoint Motlanthe or any other of the younger talent, Phosa, Sexwale and Ramaphosa as new leader, such an obvious solution to unite the ANC and the country again, and should have been done a long time before.</p>",
  "<p>George Bush's <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/24/world/24nations.html?hp\">parting speech to the UN</a> on Tuesday was a bit like a rapist deciding to whisper sweet nothings as he climbs up off his victim. Sadly, most of his victims sat sycophantically and applauded, even if they muttered behind their name placards.</p> <p>Last year, Bush's UN speech script went to the press <a href=\"http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2007/09/bush-speech-has.html\">with all his phonetic spellings put in</a>, lest he insult dear friends and allies by mispronouncing their names. For his curtain call at the world body, for someone used to autocues, he intoned a competent if uninspiring sermon to the assembled world leaders. And avoided tricky names.</p> <p>Luckily, the world had low expectations of his first visit eight years ago, so it could keep its disappointment within limits when he lowered the bar. Since then Bush has started several wars, threatened several more and brought the global economy to the precipice, while leaving his ungrateful nation several trillion dollars in extra debts from the Iraq war and bailouts to financial institutions \u2013 not a mention a few extra billion to the guys who owned and ran those institutions. It was not the best of backdrops for a farewell performance.</p> <p>Most of the sentiments in his speech would have been unexceptional, and the congregation would have nodded in agreement and off to doze, were it not for the total disconnect between the sentiments expressed and the behaviour of the preacher.<br> He preached: \"As sovereign states, we have an obligation to govern responsibly and solve problems before they spill across borders. We have an obligation to prevent our territory from being used as a sanctuary for terrorism and proliferation and human trafficking and organised crime.\"</p> <p>All true, but it would ring more so if did not come from the lips of someone whose government was \"trafficking\" humans in <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/10/30/061030ta_talk_mayer\">rendition flights</a> across the globe, or even one who had not allowed bank lobbyists to craft the financial regime that now threatens to crash the global economy.</p> <p>\"No cause can justify the deliberate taking of innocent human life,\" he said, which is almost beyond comment, although I am sure some Iraqi, Afghan or Pakistani villagers could be found who would rise to the task, let alone Lebanese villagers or Gazans minced up by US-supplied munitions.</p> <p>The brave talk at Annapolis has shrunk down to one terse reference to \"the people of the Palestinian Territories, who deserve a free and peaceful state of their own.\" If the settlers backed by American money leave them any space or water for it.</p> <p>Of course, one of Bush's problems is that by the time he came to realise the usefulness, and indeed the indispensability of working through the UN, he had made it difficult for anyone to take his overtures seriously. It was the road to Baghdad rather than the road to Damascus that saw his conversion. There he and his neocon advisers were, cock-a-hoop at their victory, and there was nothing they could do with it. They could not sell Iraqi oil, and any regime they installed would have zero legitimacy.</p> <p>They brought in the UN, but even though the UN administration and the security council were forgiving and went along, they could not show gratitude. Sending <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/nov/21/enemiesforeignanddomestic\">John Bolton</a> was the equivalent of putting King Herod in charge of Unicef, as the White House, now <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/politicsNews/idUSL1659780820071216\">savaged</a> almost weekly by Bolton's Parthian fusillades, may realise. It does not help that Bush happily echoed Bolton's flip denigrations of the institution, calling it <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/22/AR2008092202884.html\">\"the wax museum\"</a>, seemingly insouciant that if you want people to rally to a flag, even a blue one, it's best not to smear it with crap before and even while you are waving it.</p> <p>\"The objectives I've laid out for multilateral institutions - confronting terror, opposing tyranny and promoting effective development - are difficult, but they are necessary tasks,\" Bush said. Presumably unlike climate change, which got not a single mention, despite Ban Ki-moon, who had just spoken about it as the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=22836&amp;Cr=climate&amp;Cr1=change\">\"defining issue of our era\"</a>. Bush presumably has great expectations of a lucrative post-retirement career funded by big oil.</p> <p>Even so, Bolton will now be even grumpier, since his once-unilateral president used the word \"multilateral\" no less than nine times in his speech. But as with his predecessor, Bill Clinton, Bush used it without the connotations of collegiality with which less powerful nations imbue it. \"Do as I say, not as I do\" was the constant subtext.</p> <p>Above all Bush cherishes the illusion that for the billions of the world faced with climate change, pollution, mass repression and killing by governments, not to mention simple starvation, \"terrorism\" is the biggest threat. He returned to it over and over again \u2013 and it can't be for domestic reasons, since polls suggest that the American electorate have put it in it proper perspective.</p> <p>But look on the bright side, Bolton will be peeved that the Axis of Evil is currently down to two, Syria and Iran, although Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and Raul Castro may feel self-righteously peeved at being left out.</p>",
  "<p>George Bush stood unrepentant and unbowed before the 192 member states of the UN general assembly today to deliver a valedictory address devoted almost entirely to terrorism which he described as an evil that must be defeated.</p> <p>In his eighth and final address to a largely silent hall of world leaders, the US president sounded a note that has changed remarkably little since he first spoke to the general assembly in the wake of the September 11 2001 attacks on New York and Washington. </p> <p>He said the global movement of violent extremists remained a challenge as serious as any since the foundation of the UN in 1945: \"Like slavery and piracy, terrorism has no place in the modern world.\"</p> <p>Bush took the opportunity to give an assessment of his two terms in power that contained no regrets and no apology.</p> <p>Afghanistan and Iraq had been transformed, he said, \"from regimes that actively sponsor terror to democracies that fight terror.\" Libya had renounced its backing of extremists and dropped its pursuit for nuclear weapons, and Pakistan and Saudi Arabia were engaged in the struggle to root out extremism.</p> <p>Democracy too, had spread around the world under his watch. </p> <p>\"From the voting booths of Afghanistan, Iraq and Liberia, to the orange revolution in Ukraine, the rose revolution in Georgia, the cedar revolution in Lebanon and the tulip revolution in Kyrgyzstan, we have seen people consistently make the courageous decision to demand their liberty. Whenever or wherever people are given the choice, they chose freedom.\"</p> <p>In the seven years since Bush launched the so-called war on terrorism in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, his administration has become among the most controversial in US history. </p> <p>It has been widely criticised on the world stage for flouting international law, and for ineffective handling of the aftermaths of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p> <p>Amid those criticisms, the speech comes at a time when many of the objectives of the Bush administration appear to be facing reverses. The Taliban are on the rise again in Afghanistan, violence is rife in Pakistan, the Middle East peace initiative is stalled and attempts to stop Iran and North Korea from developing a nuclear capacity are wavering.</p> <p>There was only passing reference to such downsides to his legacy during the 21 minutes of the speech. The only hint at fallibility came with the concession that \"we have witnessed successes and setbacks\" and a reference to the fight in Iraq as having been \"difficult\".</p> <p>The decision to go ahead with the invasion of Iraq in 2003 in the absence of approval from the UN, which Bush derided as being close to an irrelevance, constituted one of the most serious blows to the authority of the world body since its founding. </p> <p>Bush hinted at the upheaval by talking about the \"disagreements our nations have had on Iraq\" but added that daily life in the country had improved dramatically in the past two years and \"we should all welcome this progress towards stability and peace.\"</p> <p>The president had direct words to say the delegations seated in front of him from Russia, which he said had violated the UN charter by sending troops into Georgia. \"We must stand united in our support of the people of Georgia. Young democracies around the world are watching to see how we respond to this test.\"</p> <p>He also singled out North Korea and Iran for their nuclear programmes, calling on the UN to impose stiffened sanctions against both, and Iran and Syria for continuing to sponsor terror.</p> <p>The inclusion of Iran on both his lists of culprits was not lost on the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, in New York to address the UN general assembly himself later today. The Iranian leader has threatened to \"break the hand\" of anyone who tries to touch the country's nuclear facilities.</p> <p>In a radio interview, Ahmadinejad turned the record of the Bush years back on itself. \"I'd like to ask you, is it the Iranian [army] that's around the territories around the country, or is it the US troops that are around? It is the US troops around our borders. It is not ours around the American borders.

  "<p>The world is just emerging from a week of financial turmoil which has dissolved old certainties about the economic system structuring our lives. Yet despite the fact that commentators regularly assure us that we have just witnessed a meltdown of truly global proportions, we've been treated to more pictures of bedraggled London bankers clutching cardboard boxes than we have to any concrete analysis of how the events of past few days are perceived beyond the west.</p> <p>On Wednesday last week, the Guardian featured a selection of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/17/recession.labour\">quotes</a> from prominent leftwingers on whether capitalism has had its day, a worthy contribution to the debate at a time when the <a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/edmund_conway/blog/2008/09/19/five_ways_the_financial_crisis_is_already_changing_the_world\">Telegraph</a> is heralding the end of the world as we know it and Times readers are quoting Marx on the newspaper's online message-boards. But although the demise of the free market may appear a somewhat jarring prospect over cornflakes in Kent, in many parts of the world the ideological spectrum of mainstream political and economic thinking extends far beyond blind faith in the markets \u2013 leaving those governments who have staked their credibility on IMF and World Bank-led neoliberal reforms vulnerable to social unrest.</p> <p>One such country is Egypt, where the long process of reversing Nasser's socialist economic policies of the 1950s and 1960s that was begun under President Sadat and intensified by the current regime, has produced strong growth rates in recent years. However, these percentage points have come at the cost of destroying social welfare institutions and have fuelled spiralling inflation and unemployment. Despite the presence of an ostentatious middle-class enjoying the fruits of economic liberalisation, capitalism is not accepted as an inevitability by many on the ground facing <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/inDepthNews/idUSL0404033220080406?sp=true\">bloodshed</a> in the subsidised bread queues that have lengthened as the government's free-market programmes begin to bite. In this context, the latest round of financial chaos threatens to tip an already <a href=\"http://www.hackwriters.com/EygptwaitingJS.htm\">volatile</a> political situation over the edge.</p> <p>So how will chaos on Wall Street shape political and economic developments in the Arab world's largest country? I spoke to figures from across the political divide and asked them how they thought the financial meltdown would impact upon them and their country.</p> <p>Rania al-Malky, editor of the independent newspaper <a href=\"http://www.dailystaregypt.com/\">Daily News Egypt</a>. The state-controlled press is being increasingly challenged by a new wave of independent media outlets which have been vociferous in their criticism of the government's economic policies:</p> <blockquote> <p>The impact of the meltdown on Egypt may not be felt by the average Egyptian right now, but it will certainly take its toll within months, especially if the Egyptian pound continues its devaluation against the dollar. A lopsided foreign exchange rate is detrimental to an economy like Egypt, which is service-oriented rather than industry and production-based. Although our exports have increased significantly over the past two years, we still rely almost entirely on imports to support our industries and for agricultural staples like wheat. So with a weakening Egyptian pound, both prices and inflation are bound to keep shooting up, ultimately to the detriment of the struggling Egyptian masses.</p> <p>Inflamed social sentiment against the ruling regime will naturally ensue, especially at a time when news of the corruption of businessmen and politicians is exposed daily in the media and displays of negligence and the utter lack of competence of bodies like the civil defence authority have revealed beyond a shadow of a doubt that the current administration is incapable of dealing with emergencies.</p> <p>As for the effect of an economic recession on the opposition, we must distinguish between the generally impotent official opposition parties and the increasingly effective and powerful civil-society based movements that have been able to kick up a lot of dust to lobby for workers' rights and against rising prices. Any serious economic downturn in Egypt will boost the appeal of such grassroots movements and banned Islamist groups like the Muslim Brotherhood.</p> </blockquote> <p>Hossam el-Hamalawy, a dissident <a href=\"http://arabist.net/arabawy/\">blogger</a> and member of the Egyptian Revolutionary Socialists. The web has become a vibrant outlet for many in Egypt for criticising government's policies and exposing economic corruption:</p> <blockquote> <p>Neoliberal theorists and apologists have never been on the defensive as they are today. Economic crises have already hit several countries marked as distinguished 'reformers' by international financial institutions like the IMF and World Bank, whose victims were generally workers and the urban poor. Here in Egypt, our economy on paper is booming, with a 7.1% GDP growth rate, yet inflation has already hit 25% and basic commodities have either disappeared from the local market or increased over 50% in price. Two popular uprisings have already taken place this year and this is happening on the back of the biggest strike wave in the country since the end of the second world war. We know panic travels at the speed of light through stock markets, and of course Egypt will not be immune from an economic collapse in the west, because our economy is integrated into the global market and is subject to its fluctuations. I think we can also expect a significant drop in Egypt's tourism revenues, with less people in the US and elsewhere affording vacations.</p> </blockquote> <p>Professor Abdelaziz EzzelArab, director of the Economic and Business History Research Centre at the <a href=\"http://www.aucegypt.edu/Pages/default.aspx\">American University in Cairo</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Capitalism has proven resilient and adaptable in its history of dealing with crises, and although it will not collapse overnight, it will gradually evolve into an increasingly regulated market and ultimately some form of market socialism. How will this be perceived by Egyptians? Probably with a shrug of the shoulder, if not with a sense of content. Two broad factors contributed in recent years to a dramatic reversal in the public mood towards capitalism, which followed the initial excitement surrounding the hesitant steps towards a free market taken from the late 1970s to the mid 1990s. One factor comes from abroad: the attitude, policies, and actions of the US which have earned it the popular image of an \"evil empire\". The other is domestic: the bitter record of the market in the past 17 years since the adoption of free market mechanisms through 'economic reform and structural adjustment policies'.</p> <p>The outcome of the reforms was an unholy alliance of political and business magnates, to the benefit of a tiny clique that controls both domains to the detriment of the masses. The scandals, crimes, and failures in 2008 alone are too numerous to recount and have become common talk even among ruling party columnists. The nation's experience with the system is that it lacks compassion, a basic trait in Egypt's social fabric, and it thus becomes perceived negatively. When the system is severely shaken in its global centres, as is happening now, it will likely be seen as a deserved end for capitalism, in a way not dissimilar to the attitude towards the collapse of the USSR \u2013 perceived by the public as the expected end of a tyrannical model.</p> <p>Recurrent scandals eradicated much of the regime's moral foundation in recent months. The current crisis of capitalism is untimely for the regime, inasmuch as it deprives it from the ideological underpinning of its present economic policies. The theoretical soundness of the adopted model is itself doubted and its dilemma is therefore deepened. It may be a ripe moment for the regime to realise the necessity of embracing recent calls for a new constituent assembly that would lay the grounds for an alternative order and a new constitution. But this presumes a sense of political far-sightedness that the regime has not so far displayed.</p> </blockquote> <p>Dr Abdul Hamid al-Ghazali, consul to the supreme guide of the <a href=\"http://www.ikhwanweb.com/\">Muslim Brotherhood</a> and professor of economics at Cairo University. Despite being officially outlawed, the Brotherhood is the strongest parliamentary opposition group to the ruling NDP and the most tightly-organised Islamist political force in Egypt. It has been criticised by other opposition movements for being supportive of free-market capitalism:</p> <blockquote> <p>We are in a chaotic situation in Egypt by our own making. We are witnessing corruption scandals every day, all of which are symptoms of shocking economic management. Over and above, we now have this international economic chaos which is being reflected in our own financial markets. I don't think foreign investors will be deterred from putting money into our economy, but the foreign and domestic factors together do make the situation very dramatic at a time when the government is already very weak. It has no popular support, no strength, and for the regime this financial crisis is the beginning of the end.</p> <p>The Muslim Brotherhood has been supportive of the free market and against monopolistic practices, and we continue to maintain that stance. The difference between our economic programme and that of the current regime is that we oppose the corruption and monopolising that has led to key strategic industries like oil and steel being destabilised. But free-market reforms, with strong government safeguards to prevent these kind of practices, remain Egypt's best hope for progress. </p> <p>Although we have suffered a lot from this government's economic reforms I don't think the Egyptian people have lost faith in the free market altogether. A managed free market that serves the public and provides for fairness and security, instead of capitalism which serves the interests of the regime alone, this is what people want. The crisis gives the whole country an opportunity, a chance for a new constitution and a new choice of government through the ballot box.</p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown's promise to the Labour conference today to help <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/sep/23/elearning.schools\">bridge the digital divide</a> by spending \u00a3300m to give 1.4 million poorer children free broadband access to the internet and computers as well, is a thoroughly welcome measure. Sadly, one has to say it is subject to the usual reservations about Brownite initiatives. It has been plucked out of a hat by a beleaguered prime minister fighting for his political life and will have to be financed out of an existing \u2013 and very stretched \u2013 educational budget. But let's give credit where it is due and hope that the money \u2013 to be given out by schools over three years worth up to \u00a3700 to unconnected households \u2013 will be the start of a personal commitment to the broadband revolution enabling the prime minister to escape from David Cameron's withering jibe that he is an analogue politician in a digital age.</p> <p>Delivering the internet, which has become the gateway to virtually all knowledge, sounds like the kind of Big Idea that Brown has been lacking. But to be fair, although both Tony Blair and Brown have been way behind the curve in terms of active use of the internet, lots of good work has been done by government departments and <a href=\"http://www.ofcom.org.uk/media/features/ngamain\">Ofcom</a>.</p> <p>There are two major problems to be solved. The first is the digital divide, whereby poorer people will be denied access to the gateway to knowledge that everyone else has, thereby falling even further behind as the web becomes crucial to our lives. Britain has actually made a remarkable catch-up in terms of internet penetration, thanks in no small measure to Ofcom's goadings. If you believe the figures, 99.6% of households can in theory, if not in practice, receive some sort of internet access, with an average \"headline\" speed (not always the actual one) of 3.6Mb a second to 5.9Mb/s, which is enough for most of today's uses, including video downloads. Broadband penetration is now 60%, making the UK fifth on the OECD's league tables. But that means 40% still haven't got broadband, which creates a huge divide between the haves and have-nots. The prime minister's initiative yesterday is only a drop in the ocean unless it is followed up with more proactive measures.</p> <p>The second \u2013 related \u2013 problem to be solved is what Britain should do to boost its position in the global stampede into next generation networks or superfast broadband of up to 100Mb/s. The debate about having superfast access to homes has been going on for at least 25 years, when the first proposal (by BT to deliver huge capacity fibre optic threads to the home in exchange for being given a monopoly of delivering video-on-demand) was turned down by Margaret Thatcher's government in favour of competition by encouraging media companies to lay cables. Since then there have been regular cries, still heard today, that there will never be enough demand to fill the capacity.</p> <p>This can now be seen as nonsense. In this area, supply creates its own demand \u2013 witness the explosion of videos and other media once the capacity was there to deliver it. The system is already so overloaded that when enough people switch on their <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/\"> BBC iPlayer</a> the whole system creaks and internet service providers have to slow it all down. Now look at what is in the pipeline. Web-based television (including bandwidth-hungry high definition) is rising fast. YouTube videos are likely to change from three-minute efforts to full-length movies, often made from home (once upload speeds to the internet come closer to download speeds). Business video-conferencing is at last expected to explode, enabling companies to reduce air travel in the face of rising energy costs and global warming, tele-medicine (offering monitoring and treatment without leaving your home) is around the corner and virtual worlds, already attracting hundreds of millions of users, are about to become much more popular, more sophisticated and easier to use. And this is without thinking about the next decade's uses that can only be guessed at.</p> <p>How can we achieve the nirvana of being a world leader in superfast broadband? A recently <a href=\"http://article.wn.com/view/2008/09/12/Industry_must_pay_for_superfast_broadband/\">published report</a> by ex-Cable &amp; Wireless chief executive Francisco Caio contained a wealth of practical proposals, but came out <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/13/telecoms.internetphonesbroadband\">against government intervention</a> on the grounds that the market solutions had so far delivered well. But <a href=\"http://www.computeractive.co.uk/computeractive/news/2226718/ofcom-publishes-action-plan\">today's report</a> by <a href=\"http://www.ofcom.org.uk/media/features/ngamain\">Ofcom</a>, while commending the success of the market, sensibly points out that it needed public intervention to get 99% internet capability and that if the <a href=\"http://www.broadbanduk.org/\">Broadband Stakeholder Group</a> is confident it could deliver broadband to two-thirds of the UK that would still leave a third without it, thereby aggravating the digital divide.</p> <p>Broadband companies are asking the government for a stable regime so that they can plan without fear of government intervention. That is understandable but it would be a foolhardy government that decided not to intervene especially if the oncoming recession proves so deep that broadband providers start cutting back. The government has provided a lifeline to financial companies and it may find that it needs to intervene in a Keynesian counter-cyclical way to invest in superfast broadband during a recession in the knowledge that it will give Britain a competitive advantage afterwards. With the shrinking of the financial sector it becomes all the more vital to back Britain's creative industries, whose medium is the internet. If Brown could turn yesterday's modest initiative into a major crusade to bring superfast broadband to the people, then he will do the country a great service and possibly help his own survival.</p>",

Everything must spring from energy efficiency. We have an ocean of electricity and heating profligacy to mine in this country. British Gas ran an interesting experiment recently. Eight British streets were asked to compete in cutting their fuel bills, using only the easiest of efficiency measures. In no time at all, they cut their CO2 by an average 20% and fuel bills by a third. The Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR), which <a href=\"http://www.centrica.co.uk/files/pdf/Green_Street_Interim_Report07_08.pdf\">monitored the exercise (pdf)</a> for BG, suggests that 10,000 advisers be appointed nationwide, one per 20 streets. The cost would be \u00a3500m annually against national energy savings of \u00a34.6bn. The IPPR gives a telling example of what householders, energy-services companies, and government could do could if they worked together. A \u00a3524 loan package for cavity wall and lost insulation would give annual savings of \u00a3395 per household. A quick payback indeed. <br> Then there are the new means of energy generation. Silicon Valley is not pouring billions of dollars into 50 families of clean technology (<a href=\"http://cleantechnetwork.com/index.cfm?pageSRC=CleantechDefined\">cleantech</a>) for nothing. We were already entering a green industrial revolution as the credit crunch hit panic phase. True, there will be a race against time to create mass markets in cleantech. But these are highly disruptive technologies: they can displace fossil fuels far faster than most people appreciate. Once they really get going, the prize is huge. Consider this example. Modern solar electric and heating tiles, fitted to a maximally energy-efficient home, can take that property's emissions to zero. The whole thing can be put up in a matter of days using modern offsite methods of construction. More than half the UK's greenhouse gas emissions come from buildings; the majority from homes. We can cut greenhouse gas emissions to zero, we can get rid of the need for energy bills of any kind once the capital cost is paid, and we can dump gas, coal and nuclear alike. <br> Then there is transport. Car manufacturers are aligning behind electricity as the fuel of the future. They are already well into systemic change, even at $100-barrel oil. Renewable energy can charge the plug-in super-efficient vehicles of the near future, even as massive new public transport infrastructure is built by the carbon army.</p> <p>Long term, we save much more money than we invest making this happen. It is all doable, if we just have the imagination and the will.</p>",
  "<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/mangroup\">Man Group</a></strong>, the world's biggest listed hedge fund, has come under renewed pressure following the ban on shorting financial shares announced by the FSA last week.</p> <p>Traders said the clampdown could hit the company's business, with analysts at Investec cutting their 2009 earnings forecasts by around 14% and their price target from 650p to 460p. But another reason for the day's fall was, ironically, that Man is not on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/marketforceslive/2008/sep/19/hbosbusiness.royalbankofscotlandgroup\">the FSA's list of 32 companies where shorting is prohibited</a>, and is therefore itself a target for the bears. Man ended 35.5p lower at 398p.</p> <p>Other financial shares were weaker on doubts about the proposed $700bn bank bail-out announced by the US authorities. As Treasury secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke tried to persuade Congress to back the plan, Wall Street edged higher during UK trading and helped London shares come off their worst levels. After falling as low as 5076.3, the <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/ftse\">FTSE 100</a></strong> closed down 100.1 points at 5136.1.</p> <p>But the uncertainty about the effects of the plan, even if it gets the go-ahead, helped send UK banks lower. In particular, the mortgage providers fell sharply, following a 64% slump in home-loan approvals in August. </p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/bradfordbingley\">Bradford &amp; Bingley</a></strong> fell 3.5p to 24.75p while <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/hbosbusiness\">HBOS</a></strong> - additionally unsettled by worries about whether its deal to be taken over by Lloyds TSB would go ahead - dropped 28.8p to 180.2p. Lloyds lost 13.25p to 261.75p.</p> <p>Some dealers suggested Friday's record rally could have been at least partly driven by investors scurrying to buy shares to cover their short positions rather than having to disclose them by this afternoon's deadline set by the FSA. In the event, a number of disclosures did emerge, including news that Barclays Global Investors had a 0.37% short position in St James's Place, the wealth management group which is 59% owned by HBOS. St James's was unchanged at 260p.</p> <p>Miners fell back as commodity prices slipped lower. Copper lost around 3% on profit taking amid the Paulson plan worries, helping push Vedanta Resources 177p lower to \u00a315.27. Anglo American lost 191p to \u00a321.36, while Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation closed down 78.5p at 608p.</p> <p>But UK Coal rose 8.75p to 372.25p after positive noises on the sector from business secretary John Hutton at the Labour party conference on Monday. Hutton repeated his view that new coal and nuclear power stations were vital to the UK's long-term energy needs.</p> <p>With the turmoil in the financial sector, investors looked to defensive stocks. Consumer goods group Unilever was one company to benefit from this trend, up 35p to \u00a314.87. Utility groups were also in demand, with International Power 8.5p better at 364p as Citigroup moved from hold to buy. Centrica climbed 4.5p to 330.5p ahead of news of the imminent bid from France's EDF for British Energy, down 4.5p to 724p. Centrica is expected to play some role in the deal.</p> <p>Pubs groups were unwanted after Mitchells &amp; Butlers, down 17p to 255.5p, warned of rising costs. Rival Punch Taverns lost 27.75p to 185p and Enterprise Inns fell 14.5p to 186p. Sugar group Tate &amp; Lyle ended 46.5p lower at 369.5p as it lost a US patent case over sweeteners, while publishing group Trinity Mirror lost 11.25p to 102.25p after Deutsche Bank moved from hold to sell and cut its price target from 65p to 45p.</p> <p>Among the smaller fry, Zambia-based miner Kiwara jumped after it discovered a high-grade nickel deposit at its Kawoko project, while software group Seeing Machines rose 5.5% to 2.375p after reporting a maiden full-year profit.</p> <p>But stem-cell storage firm Cryo-Save slumped 56.5p to 66p after it warned results for 2008 would be below its previous expectations.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown issued a powerful plea for the importance of government in his conference <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/23/gordonbrown.labour1\">speech</a>. It marked an end to the long era in which government was marked down, politicians were embarrassed to speak about it and behaved as if holding office was just an interim pastime before making serious money in memoirs, speeches or directorships.</p> <p>In contrast to the millionaires' row shadow cabinet front bench \u2013 the biggest collection of wealthy people outside Mayfair hedge funds \u2013 Brown invited Labour to remake the case for government. In contrast to the isolationist Tory philosophy with its visceral hostility to Europe, he delivered a speech in which the words global and international appeared more than in any prime minister's speech in years.</p> <p>Tony Blair loftily sailed above the opposition as the Tories provided little or none of it. Brown does not have that luxury \u2013 not just because the Conservatives are now a serious opposition, but because the PM's policies, from tax to public sector pay, have taken daily criticism from some trade union leaders, as well as a 1980s left grouped around <a href=\"http://www.compassonline.org.uk/\">Compass</a> and its affiliated MPs.</p> <p>Brown therefore sought to take the battle to the Conservatives. Did George Osborne really say that in the midst of a financial crisis \"it's a function of financial markets that people make loads of money out of the misery of others\"? Brown quoted the shadow chancellor, and a prime minister has to be hyper-accurate in what he says, so this extraordinary quote from Osborne should be more widely known. Indeed, some media investigation into top Tories and their links to speculators and the bonus-greed that has wreaked havoc is long overdue.</p> <p>Since the end of July Labour has turned in on itself, beginning with the venom against David Miliband after his appeal for Labour to attack the Conservatives in his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/29/davidmiliband.labour\">Guardian article</a>. It got worse at the TUC when union leaders attacked a Labour government and Brown's policies with a venom that was never brought into play against Cameron.</p> <p>It is 35 years since I first came to a Labour conference as a young delegate. The conference is a bubble moment disconnected from reality. But Brown's speech had a sharper political edge. He was right to mention the threat of the BNP, who may win seats to the European parliament next June on the back of the steady anti-EU culture developed by the Tories and the anti-EU press. As chilly economic winds blow through the labour market, as credit and orders dry up and firms shed jobs to balance their books, it may not be enough to invoke Labour's proud job creation record. Instead we need a thorough analysis of the new immaterial capitalism and what rules are needed to guard it from its self-destructive tendencies. There are specific proposals coming from socialists and Labour MEPs in the European parliament, which Britain should support. Brown could embarrass the Tories by being a leader in Europe: so often Whitehall has led the way in resisting progressive European cooperation.</p> <p>There were name checks for nearly every cabinet and some junior ministers, which suggests the idea of a team working together. But Labour and Brown have to work against a European wide turn-off from centre left and social democratic politics. The long era of relatively benign capitalism is over. Hard working families and hard working individuals \u2013 with a third of Britain in single households, it is odd that they never get a mention \u2013 feel their purchasing power is under threat as never before. To suggest higher taxes, which would further reduce the purchasing power of households, is a one-way ticket to oblivion for Labour.</p> <p>Brown was right to stress Labour's NHS record and the pledge of free check-ups for all over-40s. That should start with MPs going to local hospitals in front of the media to encourage everyone to understand the importance of taking responsibility for their own health.</p> <p>Brown insisted that Labour remained pro-business, and he was right to praise the one million firms that generate our national wealth. If Labour shrinks to its comfort zone as defined by Brown's left critics we will please ourselves with our own rhetoric but leave 75% of the electorate unmoved.</p> <p>Next week we shall see a Tory party of the rich, by the rich, for the rich. The week after, parliament returns from recess and normal politics will resume. If Labour can concentrate our fire on the Tories instead of attacking each other, things might start to get better. They cannot get much worse.</p>",
  "<p>Cabinet colleagues and Labour grandees today hailed Gordon Brown's conference as a \"real Labour\" speech in which the prime minister found his true voice. But the Conservatives portrayed it as a lurch to the left to save his leadership.</p> <p>David Miliband, who is seen as the most likely contender to succeed Brown, described the speech as \"excellent\".</p> <p>\"I think Gordon found his true voice,\" he said.</p> <p>Ed Balls, the schools secretary and a close ally of Brown's, said: \"This is has been a very united conference. I think people's gut instinct after hearing that speech will be: Gordon Brown is the right man for the job.\"</p> <p>Andy Burnham, the culture secretary, added: \"I think you have seen quite graphically here today what the party thinks about the prime minister.</p> <p>\"Leading this country is a huge, huge responsibility and task and you need a man of experience and we saw him in action today.\"</p> <p>Derek Simpson, the joint leader of the Unite union, said that the prime minister had scored an \"injury time winner\", and he predicted that Labour could now go on to win the next election.</p> <p>\"This was a real Labour speech from a real Labour leader. He showed there is a huge gulf between Labour and the Tories,\" he said.</p> <p>Billy Hayes, the general secretary of the Communication Workers' Union, said that with the current global economic crisis Brown was \"the right person at the right time\".</p> <p>Labour MP Ian Gibson, who said earlier this week that Brown needed \"an Obama moment\", declared after the speech: \"That was it.\"</p> <p>\"It was absolutely brilliant. He delivered it humbly but with a passion we don't often see in Labour politicians,\" he said. \"On the specifics he was talking about things that people really want.\"</p> <p>But George Osborne, the shadow chancellor said: \"This was Gordon Brown retreating to the left to save his job. There was nothing really new in the speech, no apology for the mess he's got the country into and no new ideas that show us how he's going to get us out of it.\"</p>",
  "<p>One-third of white Democrats, an <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/page/election-2008-political-pulse-obama-race\">AP-Yahoo News poll</a> has discovered, have a deeply negative view of black Americans. These Democrats believe that we are \"lazy\", \"violent\" and responsible for our own troubles. File under <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_bites_dog_(journalism)\">\"dog bites man\"</a>, you might think. Everyone already knew that more than a few white Americans have serious issues with black Americans.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton broke it down when <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2008-05-07-clintoninterview_N.htm\">she observed in May</a> - as a reason to support her dying campaign to become the Democratic nominee for president - that Barack Obama's \"support among working, hard-working Americans, white Americans, is weakening again.\" She was not only citing her appeal to a significant, perhaps pivotal, group of Democrats but also playing on their sense that blacks are unworthy.</p> <p>Democrats are supposed to have largely moved on from that trying period, which put on display dispiriting race and gender fissures in their party. On this front, the question is whether Obama will win the presidency. And this comes down to whether he will gain enough support from white Democrats, <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/06/09/clinton.supporters/index.html\">17% of whom plan to vote for John McCain and Sarah Palin</a>, who surely must be the worst presidential ticket, in the worst of times for Republicans and the country, in recent memory.</p> <p>But that is not what interests me most here and now. I'm more interested in the AP article that accompanies the poll. The lede states: \"Deep-seated racial misgivings could cost Barack Obama the White House.\" This is puzzling. How could \"racial misgivings\" regarding lazy, violent and irresponsible blacks cost Obama anything? What do these racial misgivings have to do with him - and the millions of other black Americans who do not fit the negative stereotype?</p> <p>I am no Obamatron, but facts are facts. Obama is a well-known figure of national and even global stature at this point. Despite the claim, often echoed sympathetically in the mainstream media, that many whites still don't know enough about him, he has written two autobiographies, served as a US senator since 2005, was an Illinois state senator for seven years before that and is a Harvard Law School graduate.</p> <p>Obama is not lazy, violent or irresponsible. He has to be one of the hardest working, conciliatory and intelligent of public citizens, though he probably is not the transformational politician his fervent supporters take him to be. Shouldn't Clinton's white Democrats love him, their racial misgivings aside? Not if these Democrats are racist - and they are.</p> <p>Read the poll results and the article. Don't blame me, the messenger. I repeat: They are racist white men and white women, who happen to be Democrats. News organisations have a responsibility to call this \"racial misgivings\" phenomenon what it is: racism. Failure to do so fuels the popular notion that the only whites who truly count as racists identify with the Klan or at least utter \"nigger\" routinely.</p> <p>If these white Democrats merely had racial misgivings, this could not cost Obama. He appears to represent the opposite of all they deem true and contemptible about blacks. So we would expect him to be their model of a good black person and their exemplar of what is possible in this country on grounds of merit and charisma - as indeed he is for many of his white supporters.</p> <p>Since Obama obviously is not lazy, violent or irresponsible, the major problem those with racial misgivings have with him must be that he is a person with conspicuous African ancestry, aka a black person. When one cannot overcome one's racial misgivings, even when presented with an individual who does not embody features that are the alleged basis for the misgivings about his group, then one is a racist.</p> <p>The racial misgivings crowd can no longer play the competency card with a straight face. Especially after the last two weeks, no Democrats of right, non-racist mind could believe that Barack Obama and Joe Biden are less competent and less likely to \"bring about the change they want\" than McCain and Palin - no matter that more than a quarter of all Democrats told the AP-Yahoo News pollsters otherwise.</p> <p>As an Ohio Democrat sitting among friends said openly: \"We still don't like black people.\" They understandably do not like us lazy, violent and irresponsible. Nor - as Republican representative Lynn Westmoreland conveyed in flat-out <a href=\"http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/westmoreland-calls-obama-uppity-2008-09-04.html\">calling Obama \"uppity\"</a> - do they like us hard working, law abiding, responsible, intelligent and ambitious. Basically, a significant number of whites, including Democrats, don't like us, period - regardless of our character, talent and achievements as individuals.</p> <p>Maybe Clinton was right that she could capture enough of the white vote and Obama could not. I'm not entirely sure what her observation says about her, but I do know what the very real possibility of its truth continues to say about the United States.</p>",
  "<p><strong>PLATINI GUNS FOR WENGER</strong></p> <p>Existentialism. Calculus. Street mime. Bread that doesn't toast and goes stale instantly. Impressionism. Flick-knives. The French have a long history of exciting new ideas, a proud tradition of launching an \u00e9pat towards the id\u00e9e re\u00e7ue, deconstructing the dominant phenomenology and stomping about in a fag-stinking and rumpled beige trench coat. As of today the latest addition to the ranks of Sartre, Derrida and Kenny Everett saying \"Ello my leetle chickadees\" is the brooding intellectual Uefa president Michel Platini, who used an interview with Grenoble news rag Dauphine Libere to let fly with a volley of sneaky verbal rabbit punches at footballing saint Ars\u00e8ne Wenger.</p> <p>Lobbed a simple question about whether video replays are needed Platini bit savagely into his baguette, jump-started his tiny bubble-shaped car and raged: \"It would make me happy that Ars\u00e8ne Wenger never sees it. I like to talk about football, him [Wenger] about business. We must stop with Wenger and all that.\" After brooding silently for five hours in a smoke-filled caf\u00e9 Platini suddenly brought up Cluj beating Roma before adding: \"That is what makes football so great. It is what people like Wenger do not want, little clubs beating the big clubs, because they want their business.\"</p> <p>All of which will come as a terrible shock to those of us who know only Wenger as the inventor of broccoli, the guru of the yoga stretch and the star jump, the pioneer of the tiny tie-knot, and the godfather of the tippet-tappety 10-game unbeaten run followed by inevitable spring collapse. Luckily Arsenal's business-obsessed, just-wants-his big-club-to-win footballing ogre has already taken his chance to have a go back: \"I am stunned by the aggressive content of Platini's words. I am a supporter of good management of clubs, for financial equilibrium ... I am fighting for the future of the game and of football,\" Wenger added, putting on a cheap plastic mask and leaping out of the window.</p> <p>The next step in fighting for football's future/dismantling the global game comes tonight in the Carling Cup against Sheffield United. Arsenal's newly flawed, ambiguous and deeply sinister manager is expected to field one of the youngest sides in the club's history, with Aaron Ramsey, Jack Wilshere, Gavin Hoyte, Emmanuel Frimpong, Tom Daley and CBeebies characters the Rubbadubbas all expected to play.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>SPEAKING OF SHEFFIELD UNITED ...</strong></p> <p>Kerching!

  "<p>With many delegates wearing T-shirts displaying the slogan \"Things can only get bitter\", 150 leftwingers and Green party activists at the rival Convention of the Left down the road from Labour's conference have debated all this week issues from economic change to the environment.</p> <p>The debates led to the moonlighting of a number of Labour conference delegates, who chose to talk about housing and transport at the Friends Meeting House rather than listen to Gordon Brown.</p> <p>According to the organisers, interest in the convention has risen ever since the economic crisis began.</p> <p>Peter Allen, a Green activist, said: \"The convention has exceeded our most optimistic expectations. We have had many delegates from the conference and local people from Manchester dropping in because the whole thing is free and people are getting worried about what is happening.\"</p> <p>Among the headline speakers have been veteran leftwinger Tony Benn, film director Ken Loach and economic expert Professor Prem Sikka of the University of Essex. Labour leftwingers such as John McDonnell, Jeremy Corbyn and ex-MP Alice Mahon have also participated in debates.</p> <p>The biggest audience was for the debate on globalisation and climate change \u2013 where 150 people crammed into one big room after the people attending demanded the two separate issues be combined into a marathon three-hour session.</p> <p>Among those there was Carol Wilcox, from Christchurch CLP (\"Don't tell my delegation; they'll go nuts), a platform speaker at Labour during the economic debate on the previous day, who came to push her case for a land tax.</p> <p>Another was Peter Grant, a member of the Aslef delegation and a trans-Pennine line train driver. He came to press the case for more electrification of the railways.</p> <p>The debate between Ken Ferguson, the editor of Scottish Socialist Voice, and Peter Cranie, prospective Green European parliamentary candidate for the North West, over whether transport should be free for all or whether train and coach transport should be subsidised because of its carbon footprint.</p> <p>Cranie, a young father to be, revealed he had gone out of his way to ensure his honeymoon had the lowest carbon footprint by travelling on the night train from Paris to Venice. He pledged that as the lead Green party candidate for the European parliament he would only travel to work in Brussels from Liverpool by train.</p> <p>Ferguson however argued for free transport paid for by new taxes on anyone earning more than \u00a314,000 a year.</p> <p>He cited a historic precedent. \"Who in this room would have thought in 1938 we would have a free NHS, but it came out of the destruction and economic collapse that followed the second world war.

  "<p>Not bad, not bad at all. Gordon Brown used to be a jollier, more pyrotechnic speaker in opposition days long ago, but he was never going to be another Abraham Lincoln and doesn't want to be a Tony Blair. For today's speech, the one that really mattered, he pulled out the stops and connected with his audience.</p> <p>Which audience? The one in the cavernous Manchester conference hall certainly. The prime minister's recurring theme was \"fairness\" \u2013 in Britain and (very much an afterthought) in the wider world. As Brown reminded them, Labour activists came into politics to do that sort of thing. </p> <p>They clapped him repeatedly and gave several half-standing ovations as he defended Labour's achievements since 1997 and promised to add to them with better health- and childcare, free scrips for the long-term sick, that internet connection for poor kids and other modest, incremental steps.</p> <p>But the key connection was emotional. Here Brown did better than he has done previously. Introduced by his wife, Sarah (was that wise in a man who proclaimed the virtues of family privacy?), he went some way to acknowledging his faults \u2013 too serious, too stubborn over that 10p tax rate \u2013 but insisted repeatedly that he cares only for the public good, for fairness.</p> <p>Because he is his very Presbyterian father's son, that means fairness for those who work hard and play by society's rules. \"We will create rules that reward those who play by them and punish those who don't. That's what fairness means to me,\" he said. And \"our aim is a something for something, nothing for nothing Britain\".</p> <p>But the real connection, an improvement for Brown, was in the way he pressed the emotional buttons with images that were tangible, not abstract, a recurring Brown weakness. Thus, the mother whose new job saves her from the loan shark, the father who survives cancer to walk his daughter up the aisle, the entrepreneur who takes on apprentices.</p> <p>The audience in the packed hall liked all this. But what of the wider public, the sceptical audience that, so the polls suggest, has virtually written him off? It will take more than a speech to persuade them. But today Brown took one crucial necessary step: he stabilised his party, at least for now. He will probably stay in office into 2009.</p> <p>Brown's next Herculean task is to help stabilise the tottering global financial system. Britain can do some of that alone \u2013 and has to \u2013 but much of it only in cooperation with other major players, not all of them \u2013 China, India, Brazil \u2013 as influential in the system as they should be.</p> <p>He defended what he and Alistair Darling had done so far to stave off disaster \u2013 rescuing Northern Rock, and the rest \u2013 and offered some ideas of what might happen in the future: better banking rules, sensible pay packages, tighter global supervision of the delinquent financial sector.</p> <p>All good stuff, carefully offsetting crowd-pleasing passages with reassurances that Labour \u2013 the cabinet, at least \u2013 still believes in a market economy. Just as the old dogma of big government (he once supported it) was wrong, so has the \"dogma of unbridled market forces been proved wrong\".</p> <p>Brown praised most of his cabinet by name, though David Miliband had to wait until near the end of the 59-minute speech. Tony Blair - after all - the first man mentioned, David Cameron not mentioned by name until close to the end.</p> <p>\"I'm all in favour of apprenticeships, but I can tell you this is no time for a novice.\" It was a rare attempt at humour before he piled into the cuts a Cameron government would make \u2013 and the folly of its naive belief in markets.</p> <p>There was still too much about British exceptionalism for some tastes - do we still always have to have the best armed forces in the world? Isn't \"pretty good\" good enough? - and easy talk about heroes in frontline public services. Those promises on policy he made will be unpicked and found wanting.</p> <p>But for today it was enough. Slower, better delivery than usual, too. Perhaps he can change, adapt to new, demanding times. Brown has bought himself time.</p>",
  "<h2>On his private life</h2> <p>Some people have been asking why I haven't served my children up for spreads in the papers. And my answer is simple. My children aren't props, they're people.</p> <h2>On his personality</h2> <p>If people say I'm too serious, quite honestly there's a lot to be serious about. I'm serious about doing a serious job for all the people of this country.</p> <h2>On his mistakes</h2> <p>Where I've made mistakes, I'll put my hand up and try to put them right. So what happened with 10p stung me because it really hurt that suddenly people felt I wasn't on the side of people on middle and modest incomes.</p> <h2>On business</h2> <p>We are and will always be a pro-enterprise, pro-business and pro-competition government.</p> <h2>On the economy</h2> <p>We do all it takes to stabilise the still-turbulent financial markets and then in the months ahead we rebuild the world financial system around clear principles.</p> <h2>On climate change</h2> <p>To end the dictatorship of oil and to avert catastrophic climate change, a transformation in our use of energy. New nuclear power, an unprecedented increase in renewables and investment in clean coal. And I am asking the climate change committee to report by October on the case for, by 2050, not a 60% reduction in our carbon emissions, but an 80% cut.</p> <h2>On public services</h2> <p>We must stand for public services that are not only available to all, but personal to each.</p> <h2>On early years education</h2> <p>We will, stage by stage, extend free nursery places for two-year-olds for every parent who wants them in every part of the country, backed by high-quality, affordable childcare for all.</p> <h2>Ending child poverty</h2> <p>I announce my intention to introduce ground-breaking legislation to enshrine in law Labour's pledge to end child poverty.</p> <h2>On education</h2> <p>Any child who falls behind will not be left behind, but will now have a new guaranteed right to personal catch-up tuition ... Any parents whose local state school falls below the expected standard will have the right to see that school transformed under wholly new leadership, or closed and new school places provided.</p> <h2>On the digital age</h2> <p>We will fund over a million extra families to get online.</p> <h2>On the NHS</h2> <p>Labour is the party of the NHS. We created it, we saved it, we value it and we always will support it ... In April a Labour Britain will become the first country in the whole world to offer free universal check-ups for everyone over 40.</p> <h2>Still on health</h2> <p>For those in our nation battling cancer, from next year you will not pay prescription charges.</p> <p>As over the next few years the NHS generates cash savings in its drugs budget, we will plough savings back into abolishing charges for all patients with long-term conditions.</p> <h2>On pensions</h2> <p>We are committed to linking pensions to earnings.</p> <h2>On social care</h2> <p>Alan Johnson [the health secretary] and I will also bring forward new plans to help people to stay longer in their own homes and provide greater protection against the costs of care - dignity and hope for everyone in their later years.</p> <h2>On benefits</h2> <p>Everyone who can work, must work. That's why James Purnell [the work and pensions secretary] has introduced reforms so that apart from genuine cases of illness the dole is only for those looking for work or actively preparing for it.</p> <h2>On crime</h2> <p>Taking action on the causes of crime will never mean indulging those who perpetrate it. Fairness demands that we both punish and prevent ... In consultation with victim support we will create an independent commissioner who will stand up for victims, witnesses and families, the people the courts and police exist to serve.</p> <h2>On immigration</h2> <p>We recognise the contribution that migrants make to our economy and our society, but the other side of welcoming newcomers who can help Britain is being tough about excluding those adults who won't and can't. That's why we have introduced the Australian-style points-based system, the citizenship test, the English language test, and we will introduce a migrant charge for public services.</p> <h2>On the Tories</h2> <p>Just imagine where we'd be if they'd been in a position to implement their beliefs: no rescue of Northern Rock, no action on speculation, no protection for mortgages, doing nothing to stop banks going under. What has become clear is that Britain cannot trust the Conservatives to run the economy.</p> <p>Their strategy is to change their appearance, to give the appearance of change, and to conceal what they really think.</p> <p>The Conservatives say our country is broken, but this country has never been broken by anyone or anything. This country wasn't broken by fascism, by the cold war, by terrorists.</p> <h2>On international relations</h2> <p>We will work with our partners in the European Union and we will work with America not just to deal with the immediate security challenges in Georgia and in Iran ... and David Miliband [the foreign secretary], Douglas Alexander [the international development secretary] and I will do everything in our power to bring justice and democracy to Burma, to Zimbabwe and to Darfur.</p> <h2>On global poverty</h2> <p>This Labour government will not allow the world to stand by as more than 20,000 children die today from diseases we know how to cure. We will not pass by as 100 million men, women and children face a winter of starvation.</p> <h2>On Labour party woes</h2> <p>Understand that all the attacks, all the polls, all the headlines, all the criticism, it's all worth it, if in doing this job I make life better for one child, one family, one community. Because this job is not about me, it's about you.</p> <p>Tough times don't weaken the determination of people who believe in what they're doing but strengthen our resolve.</p>",
  "<p>GCap Media has sold one of its last digital radio stations, children's service Fun Radio, to consultancy Folder Media.</p> <p>Folder Media, which has bought the three-year-old station for an undisclosed sum from GCap and other shareholders, said it would look to exploit the station across multiple platforms, including expanding its DAB coverage.</p> <p>The three-year-old digital station, whose other principal shareholder was Bob the Builder owner Hit Entertainment, is available on digital TV and digital audio broadcasting (DAB) radio in London and online.</p> <p>Fun Radio is the latest digital asset to be offloaded by GCap. Digital radio stations theJazz and Core were shut down earlier this year, while Planet Rock was sold to entrepreneur Malcolm Bluemel in June.</p> <p>The station claims a monthly audience of 60,000 adults and 130,000 children. In the latest Rajar figures for the second and third quarter of 2008, it had an average weekly reach in the London area of 18,000.</p> <p>Folder Media said the day-to-day operation of the station would continue to be overseen by GCap's content division, Creation. It said both GCap and Hit were still interested in supporting the station, including using it to promote Hit's brands and activities.</p> <p>\"Fun Radio is a successful little radio station that is well loved by a growing audience,\" said Matt Deegan, the creative director of Folder Media.</p> <p>\"Its audience size, when ranked alongside children's magazines shows, shows it to be a great choice for advertisers wanting to reach young parents and their children. We're very excited about it joining the Folder family.</p> <p>\"Folder Media has developed a great platform for helping radio stations reach listeners on new and social media. In time we will be applying those skills to help enhance and grow our relationship with young parents and provide an even better service for them and advertisers.\"</p> <p>Aimed at children under 10, Fun Radio was launched in 2005 by GCap, Hit Entertainment and children's radio campaigner Susan Stranks. </p> <p>The corporate structures of both its principal shareholders have changed significantly since then, including GCap's \u00a3375m sale to Ashley Tabor's Global Radio.</p> <p>Gregory Watson, the managing director of Folder Media, said Fun Radio was \"underpinned with a strong audience on DAB digital radio in London and will continue to be served by the growth in DAB penetration. </p> <p>\"Whilst the internet and digital television are great for reach, it is hours that provide the inventory for our partners and it is our DAB listeners that deliver those.\"</p> <p>Folder Media's MuxCo subsidiary has been awarded nine digital radio multiplexes in the past 12 months.

  "<p>Mayor Johnson's Telegraph <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=A1YourView&amp;xml=/opinion/2008/09/23/do2301.xml\">column</a> today \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/may/15/dailytelegraph.pressandpublishing\">kerching</a>! \u2013 defends London's bankers in spite of everything. Yes, there has been rum behaviour, but: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"Remember that this is one of the few global industries in which we truly excel; the City contributes about 9 per cent of Britain's GDP - think of all the professions and trades that feast, directly or indirectly, on the nourishment provided: the lawyers, accountants, PR firms, architects, interior designers, builders, taxi drivers and just about everyone else.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Those gloating and criticising are \"Leftys\" spouting \"neo-socialist claptrap.\" </p> <p>Oh dear. I'm not surprised by Johnson's gut sympathy with the banking sector gamblers. It's not simply that he is a free market man, but also that he has more than a touch of the chancer about him. I don't mean that unkindly: it's one of the things I kind of like about him. But here we get a whiff of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullingdon_Club\">Bullingdon</a> beastliness: the assumption and insistence that elites must be indulged in their weaknesses, not least by lesser citizens. To dissent from this is to be dismissed as a green-eyed crank. </p> <p>Pippa Crerar, <a href=\"http://crerar.standard.co.uk/2008/09/bad-timing-bori.html\">blogging</a> at the Standard, observes that his outburst may be politically ill-judged. </p> <blockquote> <p>\"Many Londoners are worried about whether they'll still be able to afford their mortgages, the safety of their savings and the rising cost of living. He may not have any concerns about his own finances...but he would do better to show he understands that many of the people he represents do. He could also tell us what plans he has as Mayor to deal with the impact of the economic storm.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Agreed. The stridency of the column also contrasts markedly with the near silence about the money market madness observed by Mssrs Osborne and Cameron. On Sunday, Mayor Johnson will be the star platform attraction at the Conservative Party Conference. I wonder how relaxed Dave is about that?</p>",
  "<p>I want to talk with you today about who I am, what I believe, what I am determined to lead this party and this great country to achieve.</p> <p>As we gather here today I know people have real concerns about the future of the country, the future of the economy and people in this hall have concerns about the future of our party too.</p> <p>And so I want to answer your questions directly, to talk with you about how amidst all the present difficulties we should be more confident than ever that we can build what I want to talk to you about today. A new settlement for new times. A fair Britain for the new age. </p> <p>But let me start with something I hope you know already. </p> <p>I didn't come into politics to be a celebrity or thinking I'd always be popular. Perhaps, that's just as well. No, 25 years ago I asked the people of Fife to send me to parliament to serve the country I love. </p> <p>And I didn't come to London because I wanted to join the establishment, but because I wanted and want to change it. </p> <p>So I'm not going to try to be something I'm not.</p> <p>And if people say I'm too serious, quite honestly there's a lot to be serious about - I'm serious about doing a serious job for all the people of this country. </p> <p>What angers me and inspires me to act is when people are treated unfairly.</p> <p>So when people share with me stories about the hard time they're having with bills, I want to help, because I was brought up seeing my parents having to juggle their budget like the rest of us. </p> <p>And when I talk to parents about schools, I'm determined that every child should have a good school, because while I got my break in a great local secondary, not all my friends got the chance to get on.</p> <p>And when I speak to victims of crime I get angry - because like them I know the difference between right and wrong. </p> <p>And so here I am - working for this incredible country, while trying as far as possible to give my children an ordinary childhood. Some people have been asking why I haven't served my children up for spreads in the papers. And my answer is simple. My children aren't props; they're people.</p> <p>And where I've made mistakes I'll put my hand up and try to put them right. So what happened with 10p stung me because it really hurt that suddenly people felt I wasn't on the side of people on middle and modest incomes - because on the side of hard-working families is the only place I've ever wanted to be. And from now on it's the only place I ever will be. </p> <p>And so I want to give the people of this country an unconditional assurance - no ifs, no buts, no small print - my unwavering focus is taking this country through the challenging economic circumstances we face and building the fair society of the future. </p> <p>The British people would not forgive us if at this time we looked inwards to the affairs of just our party when our duty is to the interests of our country. </p> <p>The people of Britain would never forget if we failed to put them first - and friends, they'd be right. </p> <p>And because this is a time of greater than ever change around us, it must be a time of higher ambition from us. And because the world of 2008 is now so different from the world of 1997 I want to talk about the new settlement we must build for these new times. </p> <p>You know, each generation believes it is living through changes their parents could never have imagined - but the collapse of banks, the credit crunch, the trebling of oil prices, the speed of technology, and the rise of Asia - nobody now can be in any doubt that we are in a different world and it's now a global age. </p> <p>In truth, we haven't seen anything this big since the industrial revolution. This last week will be studied by our children - as the week the world was spun on its axis - and old certainties were turned on their heads. </p> <p>And in these uncertain times, we must be, we will be, the rock of stability and fairness upon which people stand. </p> <p>And friends, it's a calling that summons us because in every time of profound change those with great wealth and privilege have always been able to look after themselves. </p> <p>But our duty, what gives us moral purpose, is serving the people who need us most- Britain's vast majority - people on middle and modest incomes who need to know that they are not on their own amidst this change - we are on their side. </p> <p>Where there are new risks and new pressures our duty is and will be security for all. And where there are new opportunities, our duty is and will be fair chances for everyone matched by fair rules applied to everyone. </p> <p>And insuring people against the new risks and empowering people with new opportunities is the mission of the hour. And those who say that governments should walk away when people face these risks and need these opportunities will be judged to be on the wrong side of history. </p> <p>And when the country is asking their government to meet these new challenges I say to our opponents: those who don't believe in the potential of government shouldn't be trusted to form one.</p> <p>So this is a defining moment for us - a test not just of our judgment but of our values. Today once again we are called to apply our enduring beliefs to completely new conditions.</p> <p>New Labour has always been at its best when we have applied our values to changing times. In the 1990s Tony and I asked you to change policy to meet new challenges.</p> <p>We are and will always be a pro-enterprise, pro-business and pro-competition government. And we believe the dynamism of our five million businesses large and small is vital to the success of our country. </p> <p>But the continuing market turbulence shows why we now need a new settlement for these times - a settlement that we as a pro-market party must pursue. </p> <p>A settlement where the rewards are for what really matters - hard work, effort and enterprise. </p> <p>A settlement where both markets and government are seen to be the servants of the people, and never their masters,</p> <p>Where what counts is not the pursuit of any sectional interest but the advancement of the public interest - and where at all times we put people first.</p> <p>Let us be clear the modern role of government is not to provide everything, but it must be to enable everyone.</p> <p>And just as we know that governments cannot and should not do everything, so too we know markets cannot deliver it all on their own.</p> <p>And just as those who supported the dogma of big government were proved wrong, so too those who argue for the dogma of unbridled free market forces have been proved wrong. <br> And so it falls to this party and to this government, with its commitment both to fairness and to business, to propose and deliver what after recent events everyone should now be willing to accept - that we do all it takes to stabilise the still turbulent financial markets and then in the months ahead we rebuild the world financial system around clear principles. And friends the work begins tomorrow. </p> <p>I and then Alistair will meet financial and government leaders in New York to make these proposals:</p> <p>First, transparency - all transactions need to be transparent and not hidden.</p> <p>Second, sound banking, a requirement to demonstrate that risks can be managed and priced for bad times as well as good.</p> <p>Third, responsibility - no member of a bank's board should be able to say they did not understand the risks they were running and walk away from them. </p> <p>Fourth, integrity - removing conflicts of interest so that bonuses should not be based on short term speculative deals but on hard work, effort and enterprise. </p> <p>I know that the British people think it's hard work, effort and enterprise we need to reward. <br> </p> <p>And fifth, global standards and supervision because the flows of capital are global, then supervision can no longer just be national but has to be global. </p> <p>And if we make these changes I believe London will retain its rightful place as the financial centre of the world. </p> <p>And we know that the challenges we face in this new global age didn't begin in the last week, or in the last months, but in fact reflect deeper changes in our world. For all its benefits, the global age has revealed not just financial instability but another major pressure - a rising global population demanding more energy.</p> <p>So the new settlement also requires another great and historic endeavour to end the dictatorship of oil and to avert catastrophic climate change, a transformation in our use of energy. New nuclear power, an unprecedented increase in renewables and investment in clean coal.</p> <p>And I am asking the climate change committee to report by October on the case for, by 2050 not a 60% reduction in our carbon emissions, but an 80% cut - and I want British companies and British workers to seize the opportunity and lead the world in the transformation to a low carbon economy and I believe that we can create in modern green manufacturing and service one million new jobs.</p> <p>And it's not just our duty but our basic philosophy that we do everything we can to help families through the world downturn. And while the Conservatives did nothing to help people with their gas and electricity bills in the last world downturn, this winter, millions of people will receive the help with heating bills, insulation, social tariffs - help they never received from the Conservatives.</p> <p>But you know, when it comes to public spending you can't just wave a magic wand to conjure up the money - not even with help from Harry Potter. </p> <p>And so there are tough choices and I have to say that as a result of the events of recent weeks there are going to be tougher choices we will have to make and priorities we will have to choose. And just as families have to make economies to make ends meet, so this government must and will ensure that we get value for money out of every single pound of your money that is spent. But I say to you that we will invest it wisely, continuing our record investment in schools, Sure Start centres, transport and hospitals.</p> <p>And if we make the right decisions to take people through the world downturn fairly we will find that, despite the current troubles, British firms and British workers can reap the rewards of a world economy set to double in size. </p> <p>With Britain's great assets - our stability, our openness, our scientific genius, our creative industries, and yes our English language - I know that this can be a British century and I'm determined it will be.</p> <p>But my argument today is that the new settlement for the global age must do even more to empower people with new opportunities insure people against new risks and as a result value hard work effort and enterprise. It's the economy that's been making the headlines, but there are other big changes too.</p> <p>People feel their communities are changing before their eyes and it's increasing their anxiety about crime and anti-social behaviour. And so we will be the party of law and order. </p> <p>And for the first time ever we've got more British pensioners than British children - more people living longer on fixed incomes and worried about whether they'll need long term care. And so we will be the party that will ensure security and dignity for pensioners. </p> <p>And there are new pressures on parents - worrying about balancing work and family life but also about advertising aimed straight at their children and what their children are watching or downloading from the internet. And so we will be the party of the family.</p> <p>And so the new settlement for our times show how Britain can meet all these challenges too and its more than about a fair prosperity - it must be about fair chances and fair rules too. </p> <p>You know some people say that there's an inevitable political cycle in this country - as sure as night follows day. I don't agree. The challenge of these new times demands a truly progressive government to help people cope with the new risks and make the most of the new opportunities. That's why I believe that now more than ever - even more than in 1997- this country needs a Labour government. </p> <p>You know to govern is to choose - and it's what a government chooses to do when it's tested that demonstrates its priorities and reveals its heart. </p> <p>It is not the arithmetic of statistics but the fabric of people's lives.</p> <p>When we talk about three million more people in work since 1997 - that's not just a number, that's a life that's been changed - three million times over. That's the young woman laid off in the mid 90's who's now built a booming business of her own. Three million new jobs not by accident, but by our actions. And in the years to come we will demonstrate again that real power of Labour to change lives.</p> <p>And when we talk about the one million small and medium-sized businesses set up in the last eleven years, that's not just a number - that's the entrepreneur who can treat her parents to a summer holiday, and the local businessman who's taken on two local teenagers as apprentices. One million new businesses demonstrating yet again the real power of Labour to change lives.</p> <p>And when we talk about one million people benefiting from new Labour's minimum wage that's not just a number - that's a dad doing security shifts who can now afford a birthday party for his child and it's a mum who doesn't have to go to a loan shark to pay for her kids' Christmas. One million people freed from exploitation- and now the minimum wage rising year on year - that's the real power of Labour to change lives.</p> <p>And when we talk about the 240,000 lives that are saved by the progress Labour's NHS has made in fighting cancer and heart disease, that's not just a number - that's the dad who lives to walk his daughter up the aisle and the gran who is there to clap and cry at her grandson's graduation. 240,000 families still together - and now thousands more with new and better treatments from an expanding NHS -- we're changing the world the only way it can ever really change - one life, one family, one hope at a time. That's the real power of Labour to change lives.</p> <p>And why do we always strive for fairness?</p> <p>Not because it makes good soundbites.</p> <p>Not because it gives good photo opportunities.</p> <p>Not because it makes for good P.R.</p> <p>No. </p> <p>We do it because fairness is in our DNA.</p> <p>It's who we are - and what we're for.</p> <p>It's why Labour exists.</p> <p>It's our first instinct, the soul of our party.</p> <p>It's why when things get tough, we get tougher. We stand up, we fight hard - for fairness. We don't give in, and we never will.</p> <p>For me fairness is treating others how we would be treated ourselves. So it isn't levelling down but empowering people to aspire and reach ever higher. And to take advantage of all the opportunities of the global economy I want to unleash a new wave of rising social mobility across our country. </p> <p>For too long we've developed only some of the talents of some people - but the modern route to social mobility is developing all the talents of all the people....helping those who are working their way up from very little and lifting up those in the middle who want to get on. It means supporting what really matters - hard work and effort and enterprise. This is not just the new economic necessity, it is the modern test of social justice and the radical centre ground we occupy and will expand. </p> <p>And fairness is why Harriet is introducing the first ever equalities bill. And let me thank her for her tireless work as deputy party leader. </p> <p>Fairness is why Ed Miliband is ensuring that community and third sector organisations can play their proper part in every neighbourhood.</p> <p>And it is why our whole party is leading the fight against the British National Party. </p> <p>Fairness is why John Denham is extending university access, why Ruth Kelly has introduced for the first time free bus travel for pensioners and why John Hutton and our Labour Members of the European Parliament but are fighting to free agency workers from the scourge of exploitation. </p> <p>But fairness for the future also means a big change that I want to explain today. We have always stood for public services that are universal, available to all. Now we must stand for public services that are not only available to all, but personal to each. </p> <p>For me, the fairer future starts with putting children first - with the biggest investment in children this country has ever seen. It means delivering the best possible start in life with services tailored to the needs of every single precious child.</p> <p>In 1997 there were no Sure Start centres and nursery education for only the few. Today, thanks to the work of Beverley Hughes there are children's centres opening in every community to serve 3 million children who a few years ago had nothing, and free nursery education for every three and four year old.</p> <p>But our ambitions must be greater still. I want Britain to take its place among the leading nations in pre-school services, and so I pledge here today in Manchester starting in over 30 communities, and then over 60, we will, stage by stage, extend free nursery places for two year olds for every parent who wants them in every part of the country backed by high quality, affordable childcare for all.</p> <p>That's the fairness parents want - and that's the fairness every Labour party member will go out and fight for.</p> <p>And because child poverty demeans Britain, we have committed our party to tackle and to end it. The measures we have taken this year alone will help lift two hundred and fifty thousand children out of poverty. The economic times are tough of course that makes things harder- but we are in this for the long haul - the complete elimination of child poverty by 2020. And so today I announce my intention to introduce ground-breaking legislation to enshrine in law Labour's pledge to end child poverty.</p> <p>And Ed Balls and I will never excuse, explain away or tolerate low standards in education. So we will keep up the pace of reform: more academies, trust and specialist schools, more of the brightest and best graduates becoming teachers, more investment in building schools for the future - state of the art schools for world class schooling.</p> <p>Fairness demands nothing less than excellence in every school, for every child. So today I guarantee to parents two fundamental rights:</p> <p>Because every child should leave primary school able to read, write and count, any child who falls behind will not be left behind - but will now have a new guaranteed right to personal catch up tuition.</p> <p>And because all parents should see their children taught in schools which achieve good results at GCSE, our pledge today is that any parents whose local state school falls below the expected standard will have the right to see that school transformed under wholly new leadership, or closed and new school places provided.</p> <p>And we want to enable all families to use the internet to link back to their children's school - and so Jim Knight is announcing that we will fund over a million extra families to get online, on the way to our ambition of Britain leading the world with more of our people than any other major economy able to access the internet and broadband.</p> <p>And now as we celebrate the 60th anniversary of the NHS let me on behalf of all of us here, and all the people of the country - thank all the NHS staff - the cooks and cleaners, the paramedics and porters, the doctors and midwives and nurses.<br>You have served our country and served a great ideal - the principle that in a fair society health-care should not be a commodity to be bought by some but a right to be enjoyed by all. </p> <p>Labour is the party of the NHS - we created it, we saved it, we value it and we always will support it. </p> <p>And you know already that for me, this isn't a political agenda but a personal mission. Last year in Bournemouth I told you how when I was 16, I got injured playing rugby and lost the sight forever in my left eye. I knew I couldn't play football or rugby anymore. But I could still read. </p> <p>But what I didn't tell you last year was that then one morning I woke up and realised my sight was going in my good eye. I had another operation and lay in the darkness for days on end. At that point my future was books on tape. </p> <p>But thanks to the NHS, my sight was saved by care my parents could never have afforded. And so it's precisely because I know and have heard from others about the miraculous difference a great surgeon and great nurses and great care can make that I'm so passionate about the values of the NHS and so committed to reforming it to serve these values even better.</p> <p>That's why in just one year in the fight against hospital infections, we have doubled the number of matrons and achieved a 36 percent reduction in MRSA.<br>And let us remember what a Labour government has now achieved: the lowest ever waiting times in the whole history of the NHS. <br>And now to respond to new times and higher aspirations we want to make the National Health Service more personal to people's needs - patients more involved in their own health care with more choice and more control than ever before. </p> <p>And I've always found it unfair that we cannot offer on the NHS the comprehensive services that private patients can afford to buy. And so in April a Labour Britain will become the first country in the whole world to offer free universal check ups for everyone over 40.</p> <p>And I say that there is no vested interest, no matter how powerful, that we are not prepared to take on when change is needed for the sake of the nation's health.<br>We have already made it easier for busy families to go to the doctor. Whilst a year ago only 1 in 10 patients had access to GPs at weekends and in the evening. Now almost half of all practices are open and by the end of next year the majority will be open even longer. </p> <p>And today I want to show how this government will pursue what I believe to be one of the noblest and boldest contributions of this country to our shared human fortunes.</p> <p>Since the war nearly one third of Britain's Nobel prizes have been for our genius in medicine. We should now aspire to stretch the boundaries of human knowledge and human health ever further. </p> <p>I want Britain to lead the world in beating the diseases which cause so much heartbreak for families. Over the last few years we've made major breakthroughs in research relevant to cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and strokes and many more. </p> <p>But these are yet to be turned into treatments from, which we can all benefit from. And so let me tell you today that the unprecedented 15 billion pounds we are investing in medical research will be directed to turning the major advances of the last few years into actual treatments and cures for NHS patients.</p> <p>Over the next decade we can lead the way in beating cancer and other diseases - a great endeavour worthy of a great country: proud because we have a health service focused on 21st century needs. </p> <p>A NHS that is available to all and personal to each means meeting another challenge of the future: offering, for the first time, every patient with a long term condition their own care plan. <br>But alongside new patient responsibilities will be new rights. And because we know that almost every British family has been touched by cancer, Alan Johnson and I know we must do more to relieve the financial worry that so often goes alongside the heartache. And so I can announce today for those in our nation battling cancer from next year you will not pay prescription charges. </p> <p>And this is not the limit of our commitment to a fair NHS in a fair society. As over the next few years the NHS generates cash savings in its drugs budget we will plough savings back into abolishing charges for all patients with long-term conditions. That's the fairness patients want and the fairness every Labour party member will go out and fight for.</p> <p>And in a fair society the fact that older people are living longer should be a blessing for their families not a burden. We are committed to linking pensions to earnings.<br>And I am proud that we will now be implementing for the first time equality for women in their retirement.</p> <p>No-one should live in fear of their old age because they worry their social care will impose financial burdens they could never afford to face and that the minute they need care puts the family home at risk. </p> <p>The generation that rebuilt Britain from the ashes of the war deserves better and so I can tell you today that Alan Johnson and I will also bring forward new plans to help people to stay longer in their own homes and provide greater protection against the costs of care - dignity and hope for everyone in their later years.<br>That's the fairness older people deserve - and the fairness every Labour party member will go out and fight for. </p> <p>So when people say in these tough times there's nothing we can do, there's nothing higher to aim for, no great causes left worth fighting for, my reply is our ideas are the ideas that will realise the hopes of families for a better future. Providing free nursery care for more children who need it is a cause worth fighting for. </p> <p>Providing better social care for older people who need it is a cause worth fighting for. Delivering excellence in every single school is a cause worth fighting for. Universal check-ups and new help to fight cancer - these are all causes worth fighting for. This is the future we're fighting for.</p> <p>And in this world of vast economic and social change, new opportunity for all must be matched with a new responsibility from all. Our aim is a something for something, nothing for nothing Britain. A Britain of fair chances for all, and fair rules applied to all.</p> <p>So our policy is that everyone who can work, must work. That's why James Purnell has introduced reforms so that apart from genuine cases of illness, the dole is only for those looking for work or actively preparing for it. That's only fair to the people pulling their weight. </p> <p>And let me be clear about the new Labour policy on crime; taking action on the causes of crime will never mean indulging those who perpetrate it. Fairness demands that we both punish and prevent.</p> <p>Jacqui Smith and Jack Straw are introducing a landmark reform in our justice system - to put victims first. In consultation with victim support we will create an independent commissioner who will stand up for victims, witnesses and families - the people the courts and police exist to serve. And Damilola Taylor's father Richard is with is here today. </p> <p>He's an inspiring example of the determination to see some good come out of personal tragedy. Last weekend he led thousands on a march through our capital, sending a united message. We will take the knives off our streets.</p> <p>And justice seen is justice done - so you will be seeing more neighbourhood policing on the street, hearing more about the verdicts of the court, able to see the people who offended doing community payback which will be what it says; hard work for the public benefit at the places and times the public can see it. That's only fair to the law abiding majority.</p> <p>Nobody in Britain should get to take more out of the system than they are willing to put in. I am proud that Britain will honour our obligations to provide refuge from persecution. And we recognise the contribution that migrants make to our economy and our society, but the other side of welcoming newcomers who can help Britain is being tough about excluding those adults who won't and can't. That's why we have introduced the Australian-style points-based system, the citizenship test, the English language test and we will introduce a migrant charge for public services. </p> <p>That's only fair to the public who play by the rules and to the new citizens who uphold the rules.</p> <p>So across the board, we will create rules that reward those who play by them and punish those who don't. That's what fairness means to me.</p> <p>You know our party so often in its history has been home to the big ideas - ideas later taken for granted, but revolutionary in their time. Just think, the vote for working men, and then for women, the NHS, legal protection from race or sex discrimination. These are no longer just Labour policies, they are established British values - they are the common sense of our age.</p> <p>And we should never forget one thing - that every single blow we have struck for fairness and for the future has been opposed by the Conservatives. </p> <p>And just think where our country would be if we'd listened to them. No paternity leave, no New Deal, no bank of England independence, no Sure Start, no devolution, no civil partnerships, no minimum wage, no new investment in the NHS, no new nurses, no new police, no new schools.</p> <p>And so let's hear no more from the Conservatives - we did fix the roof while the sun was shining.</p> <p>And just think if we'd taken their advice on the global financial crisis. Their policy was to let northern rock fold and imperil the whole financial system, our Labour government saved northern rock so not a single UK depositor lost out. </p> <p>Their policy said, in this week of all weeks, that speculative short selling should continue. We acted decisively to end reckless speculation. </p> <p>And the conservative policy would mean that at this very moment, there would be no regulation at all to protect homeowners. We are the party of protecting of homeowners rights. </p> <p>Do you know what their Shadow Chancellor really said? In the week that banks were collapsing the man who wants to run our economy not only said: this is not a problem caused by the financial markets but went on to say and, I quote, \"that it's a function of financial markets that people make loads of money out of the misery of others.\"</p> <p>Just imagine where we'd be if they'd been in a position to implement their beliefs - no rescue of Northern Rock, no action on speculation, no protection for mortgages, doing nothing to stop banks going under. </p> <p>What has become clear is that Britain cannot trust the Conservatives to run the economy.</p> <p>Everyone knows that I'm all in favour of apprenticeships, but let me tell you this is no time for a novice.</p> <p>But I believe in giving credit where it's due. The Conservative leader's team are smart - they've got a plan, and they are implementing it ruthlessly. </p> <p>Their strategy is to change their appearance, to give the appearance of change, and to conceal what they really think.<br>And when salesmen won't tell you what they are selling, it's because they are selling something no-one should buy.</p> <p>But I'm a man for detail and I've discovered some clues about what would be in store in a Conservative Britain. </p> <p>They want us to believe that, like us, they now care about public services. But when Mr Cameron actually talks to his party about their spending plans he says the difference between Labour and Tory levels of public investment will be \"dramatic\" and \"fundamental\". </p> <p>They want to tell us we're all progressives now but the day that Hazel Blears and Caroline Flint were announcing a one billion pound package to support millions of homeowners, the Conservatives were confirming that their first tax priority is to take that one billion pounds from hard working families and hand it over to the 3,000 richest estates in Britain.</p> <p>And they want to tell us they now believe in investing in education, but they are committed to slashing 4.5 billion from the schools building programme, axing the educational maintenance allowances that help poorer students stay on and opposing the raising the education leaving age to eighteen and stopping training programmes. And yes friends, they would even take away Sure Start from infants and their parents. One of our greatest gifts to the future - one of the first priorities for Tory cuts.</p> <p>The Conservatives may want to represent the future, but whether its Europe or energy, planning or tax credits, university places or 42 days, whenever they are tested on substance they have nothing to offer to meet the big challenges of tomorrow, because they are prisoners of their past.</p> <p>If you look beneath the surface, you'll see that the Conservatives might have changed their tune, but they haven't changed their minds. </p> <p>The Conservatives say our country is broken - but this country has never been broken by anyone or anything. This country wasn't broken by fascism, by the cold war, by terrorists. </p> <p>Of course there are problems, but this is a country being lifted up every day by the people who love it. </p> <p>We've got 4 million people helping neighbourhood watch, 6 million sports volunteers and over 5 million people doing amazing work as carers.</p> <p>And just as we celebrated our national triumph when we won the 2012 games for London, so too were Andy Burnham, Tessa Jowell and I, along with all of you, filled with pride this summer as our Olympic and Paralympics heroes showed British brilliance at its best. </p> <p>That's why for all the challenges, I don't believe Britain is broken - I think it's the best country in the world. I believe in Britain. </p> <p>And stronger together as England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland we can make our United Kingdom even better.</p> <p>And ours is a country full of heroes.</p> <p>And we pay special tribute to the heroism of our armed forces, as Des Browne said yesterday - to their service and sacrifice in Iraq and in Afghanistan and in peacekeeping missions around the globe. Quite simply the best armed forces in the world.</p> <p>The whole lesson of the new world I described earlier is that we must work together to meet the great shared challenges vital to our future.</p> <p>And unlike the Conservatives who are extremists and isolationists on Europe, we will work with our partners in the European Union and we will work with America not just to deal with the immediate security challenges in Georgia and in Iran. <br>And I tell you that what we do together for the poor and vulnerable is an act of compassion, but it is more than that. It is what will determine whether this new global society succeeds or fails.<br>And David Miliband, Douglas Alexander and I will do everything in our power to bring justice and democracy, to Burma, to Zimbabwe and to Darfur.</p> <p>And I promise you I will work with other countries to bring a permanent settlement - a secure Israel and a viable Palestine - to deliver peace for the people of the Middle East. </p> <p>And this week at Britain's request the United Nations has summoned the leaders of the world to a special summit on what we know is a global poverty emergency. </p> <p>You know, in the museum in Rwanda which commemorates the millions who lost their lives as the world looked the other way, there is a picture of a young boy called David - a ten year old who was tortured to death. His last words were \"don't worry - the United Nations will come for us\". </p> <p>But we never did. That child believed the best of us only to discover that the pieties repeated so often meant in reality nothing at all. The words \"never again\" became just a slogan and not what it should be - the crucible in which are values are tested. I tell you, this Labour government will not allow the world to stand by as more than 20,000 children die today from diseases we know how to cure. We will not pass by as 100 million men, women and children face a winter of starvation. </p> <p>So the poor will not go unheard tomorrow at the United Nations, because we the British people will speak up for them and for justice.</p> <p>The fair society. Fairness at home. Fairness in the world - that's the new settlement for new times. </p> <p>I know what I believe.</p> <p>I know who I am.</p> <p>I know what I want to do in this job.</p> <p>And I know that the way to deal with tough times is to face them down.</p> <p>Stay true to your beliefs.</p> <p>Understand that all the attacks, all the polls, all the headlines, all the criticism, it's all worth it, if in doing this job I make life better for one child, one family, one community.</p> <p>Because this job is not about me, it's about you. </p> <p>And I'll tell you what else I've learned - that tough times don't weaken the determination of people who believe in what they're doing but strengthen our resolve. </p> <p>You know when I talk to the people who do the tough jobs - nurses, teachers, police officers, soldiers, carers - about why they do what they do, so often they say to me \"because I want to make a difference\". </p> <p>And doesn't each of us want to say of ourselves:</p> <p>That I helped someone in need.</p> <p>That I come to the aid of a neighbour in distress.</p> <p>That I will not pass by on the other side.</p> <p>That I will give of myself for something bigger than myself. </p> <p>And each of us can make a contribution - but together we are even more than that. <br>United we are a great movement led by hopes not fears, gathered person by person - one individual, and then a few more, then hundreds, then thousands, then finally millions strong, a movement where I want each of us to say to each other:<br>This is our country, Britain. We are building it together, together we are making it greater;</p> <p>Together we are building the fair society in this place and in this generation. </p> <p>The mission of our times- the fair society, the cause that drives us on - and we will win, not for the sake of our party, together we will win for the future of our country.</p>",

  "<p>The closing date for applications to be the Arts Council's new chair, to succeed Sir Christopher Frayling, is tomorrow. So sharpen those pencils, potentials! Names being bandied about include <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Eyre\">Richard Eyre</a>, apparently favoured by his successor at the helm of the National Theatre, Nicholas Hytner; and Genista McIntosh, also formerly of the National Theatre, who so thoroughly whipped ACE into shape in her <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2008/jul/30/arts.council.funding\">report</a> into the debacle over the last funding round.</p> <p>But who would you like to see as the next chair of the Arts Council? My own view is that it must be someone who complements and contrasts with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2008/apr/14/art.artsfunding\">Alan Davey</a>, the chief exec. Davey is thoughtful (a good thing) and perhaps sometimes a little diffident, so someone really dynamic and charismatic who can talk the talk would be a good thing. I also think that after 60 years, ACE really should be appointing a woman. And finally \u2013 I've a hunch it would be good to have someone from outside the arts. Davey is marinated in the arts, and fantastically knowledgable. So I reckon it would be good to have someone who has a real enthusiasm for culture, and can strongly represent its claims to the Government and elsewhere, without necessarily coming from within that world: a fresh eye, so to speak. So a dynamic, fabulous, clever woman from the private sector or broadcasting?

  "<p>Wealthy industrialised countries including the UK are allowing overseas bribery to go unchecked through insufficient regulation of their private sectors, an anti-corruption group warned today.</p> <p>The latest Transparency International <a href=\"http://www.transparency.org/news_room/in_focus/2008/cpi2008\">Corruption Perceptions Index</a> said the poorest countries still had the highest levels of corruption.</p> <p>However, it added that the data casts a \"critical light on government commitment [in wealthy countries] to rein in the questionable methods of their companies in acquiring and managing overseas business, in addition to domestic concerns about issues such as the role of money in politics\".</p> <p>The UK, which is ranked 16th in the index - Denmark, Sweden and New Zealand were in joint first place as the least corrupt countries - was highlighted as one of the \"notable European decliners\" in the index because of the December 2006 decision to halt the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/bae\">criminal investigation of BAE</a> in relation to the al-Yamamah arms contract with Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>\"The decision to stop the criminal investigation raised acute concerns over the UK's international obligation to combat corruption,\" Transparency International said. </p> <p>The US, whose rating has fallen slightly in recent years, had a ranking of 18th, \"one of the lowest among the world's leading industrialised countries\".</p> <p>\"Contributing factors may include a widespread sense that political finance is in need of reform, with lobbyists and special interest groups perceived to have an unfair hold on political decision-making,\" Transparency International said. </p> <p>Somalia came bottom of the 180 countries listed in the index, which is based on expert and business surveys. It was just ahead of Iraq and Burma. </p> <p>The report said corruption jeopardised the global fight against poverty. It said there was a need to \"ensure development assistance is designed to strengthen institutions of governance and oversight in recipient countries, and that aid flows themselves are fortified against abuse and graft\".</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.jcs.mil/bio_odierno.html\">Lieutenant General Ray Odierno</a> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/16/iraq.usa\">took over command of coalition forces in Iraq</a> this week at a time when the \"surge has succeeded\" narrative has cemented the perception that American military tactics are the primary driver of events on the ground. But the reality confronting Gen Odierno <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/17/iraq.military\">could not be more different</a>. A confident Nouri al-Maliki, the Iraqi prime minister, and other Iraqi actors are now firmly in control, leaving the scope of US military action severely limited. Despite the continued presence of nearly 140,000 US troops, America is <a href=\"http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/JI10Ak01.html\">not even the most influential foreign power in Iraq</a>. Those troops are in fact an impediment to the political progress that must occur to secure a sustainable resolution to Iraq's numerous conflicts. The only responsible course of action for the next president is to drawdown US forces, increasing the stakes for Iraqi leaders and encouraging compromise rather than confrontation as they address their differences. </p> <p>Maliki's <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4932468.stm\">transformation</a> has been as swift as it was unexpected. Rescued from political extinction just 10 months ago, after the intervention of Condoleezza Rice prevented him from being voted out by his coalition partners, Maliki surprised most observers with an aggressive military push this spring to retake Basra from Shia militias, particularly <a href=\"http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/al-sadr.htm\">Muqtada al-Sadr's Mahdi army</a>. When that campaign faltered, Iran stepped in to save Maliki by pressuring Sadr to stand down both in the south and in Sadr City. Both bailouts have dramatically altered the landscape in Iraq. Maliki now appears to be doing Iran's bidding but relying on the crutch of American troops to back him up.</p> <p>Maliki has consolidated his position and is increasing the power of the central government, directing Iraq's ever-growing military and intelligence apparatus independent of US control for the first time since the invasion. Emboldened by success in Basra and Sadr City, the Shia-dominated government in Baghdad is now projecting power into areas controlled by its ethnic and sectarian rivals. In the span of these short months the pendulum has swung entirely on the perceptions of Maliki, going from concerns about his alarming weakness to fears of dangerous over-confidence. </p> <p>Last month, <a href=\"http://www.iraqupdates.com/p_articles.php/article/35760\">Maliki ordered the Iraqi army into the mostly Kurdish town of Khanaqin</a> ostensibly as part of a broader military operation to root out al-Qaida militants in Diyala province. The move inflamed the Kurds, whose Peshmerga forces had kept out al-Qaida, and most viewed it as a naked power play by Baghdad. The standoff between the Kurdish Regional Government and Baghdad over Khanaqin has exacerbated Arab-Kurdish tensions and further imperiled any negotiated settlement in Kirkuk.</p> <p>Next month, the central government will take over the Sunni Awakening Councils, the programme of <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gkx-3oYeFwuWKCusr2jrojs98w8wD932NTQ01\">US payments to Sunnis to turn against the insurgency</a> that began in 2006 and is responsible for much of the reduction in violence. Maliki has pledged to integrate as many as 20,000 of these armed Sunni \"sons of Iraq\" into the security forces, but there are disturbing signs that the Shia government is orchestrating a campaign to harass, intimidate or arrest them, which could reignite Sunni-Shia conflict. </p> <p>Iran is the ultimate beneficiary of these actions against the Kurds and the Sunnis. Tehran has its own <a href=\"http://www.caucaz.com/home_eng/breve_contenu.php?id=182\">Kurdish problem</a> and does not want the Kurds in Iraq to establish firm control in the oil-rich areas beyond its current base in the three provinces in the north of Iraq. And, of course, the Shia mullahs have been in constant conflict with Iraq's Sunnis ever since they came to power in 1979, and have a vested interest in their continued marginalisation in post-Saddam Iraq. Even if these moves go bad it would serve Iranian interests, as Iraq would be weakened by spasms of violence, and it could prolong American involvement creating additional time for Iran to further develop its nuclear programme.</p> <p>The cruel irony for Gen Odierno is that although American troops made vital contributions to the reduction in violence, there is nothing they can do to resolve these burgeoning conflicts, and the very stability that they provide is encouraging the various factions to aggressively advance their own objectives at the expense of necessary compromise which jeopardises these hard-fought gains.</p> <p>Success in Iraq is now dependent upon increasing the incentives for Iraqi leaders toward accommodation. The best way to achieve this objective is to create an environment in which Iraqis are responsible for the full consequences of their actions. The large US troop presence is currently doing the opposite, embedding a moral hazard among Iraq's leaders and inhibiting consensus. The only way to preserve the gains of the last 18 months is to begin the orderly withdrawal of US troops.</p>",
  "<p>Scientists claim to have discovered evidence for large releases of methane into the atmosphere from frozen seabed stores off the northern coast of Siberia. </p> <p>A large injection of the gas - which is 21 times more potent as an atmospheric heat trap than carbon dioxide - has long been cited by climate scientists as the potential trigger for runaway global warming. The warming caused by the gas could destabilise permafrost further, they fear, leading to yet more methane release.</p> <p>But climate experts have expressed caution at the claims, which have yet to be published in a peer reviewed scientific journal. Methane release from stores of so-called gas hydrates, that can form on land or under the sea, is not new to researchers. Huge quantities are known to exist in the Arctic, but special circumstances would need to exist for significant releases to occur.</p> <p>\"Methane release has been known for a number of years now,\" said geologist Dr Lorenz Schwark at the University of Cologne, Germany. \"There are various areas around the world that have been studied in detail.\"</p> <p>He said the process of methane release from hydrates had been filmed by robotic vehicles off the coast of Vancouver Island in Canada, for example.</p> <p>\"The problem is that in the Russian or in the Siberian Arctic on land and in the sea there is very little coverage by hard data and there are hardly any measurements. And therefore there is a lot of speculation going on.\"</p> <p>In most cases, methane released from the sea bed is consumed by micro-organisms as it bubbles up to the surface. But if it is released quickly enough it could make it into the atmosphere. </p> <p>\"The most likely process where this happens - and there is geological evidence that it has happened in the past - is when the methane gas hydrate layer in the sediment destabilises on a slope. And then we have a slope failure, a landslide underwater,\" Dr Schwark said.</p> <p>\"As long as the scientists in the Siberian Arctic are not able to report very strong increases in submarine landslides and slope failures, I wouldn't expect that the release into the atmosphere is so severe that it is really very serious at the moment,\" Schwark added.</p> <p>The scientists who have studied methane levels along Russia's northern coastline are aboard the Russian research ship Jacob Smirnitskyi. </p> <p>\u00d6rjan Gustafsson of Stockholm University in Sweden told the Independent newspaper in an email from the vessel: \"An extensive area of intense methane release was found. At earlier sites we had found elevated levels of dissolved methane. </p> <p>\"Yesterday, for the first time, we documented a field where the release was so intense that the methane did not have time to dissolve into the seawater but was rising as methane bubbles to the sea surface. These 'methane chimneys' were documented on echo sounder and with seismic [instrument].\"</p> <p>At some locations he said concentrations of the gas were 100 times the background level. These anomalies were documented in the East Siberian Sea and the Laptev Sea, covering several tens of thousands of square kilometres.</p> <p>Gustafsson added: \"The conventional thought has been that the permafrost 'lid' on the sub-sea sediments on the Siberian shelf should cap and hold the massive reservoirs of shallow methane deposits in place. </p> <p>\"The growing evidence for release of methane in this inaccessible region may suggest that the permafrost lid is starting to get perforated and thus leaking methane.\"</p> <p>Estimates for the amount of carbon locked up in the hydrates vary from 500 to 5000 gigatonnes. Scientists predict that warming will release some of these deposits, but modelling the temperature rise that would trigger significant releases has proved extremely difficult.</p>",
  "<p>So, as everyone expected, the idea of an annual \"free week\" of theatregoing proposed by the McMaster review has been declared a dead duck. In its place rises <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/stage/2008/sep/23/free.theatretickets\">Andy Burnham's proposal in which 18-to-26-year-olds will be able to access free theatre tickets at 95 theatres across the country</a>. Over a two-year period beginning next February, Burnham hopes to give two million tickets away in a government scheme funded to the tune of \u00a32.5m. </p> <p>Now I'm not great at maths, but even I can work out that means that a theatre will only be getting \u00a32.50 for each seat it gives away. This is less than the \u00a35 that the National currently gets from its <a href=\"http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/33036/home/entrypass.html\">Entrypass scheme for teenagers</a>, and could be less than schemes that other theatres have in place including pay-what-you-can nights. Of course \u00a32.50 is better than nothing if your theatre is half-empty, but will more successful or smaller venues be keen to sign up to a scheme in which they must make the same number of tickets available on a weekly basis over a two-year period? Or will it be only less popular theatres, or those doing substandard work, who jump on board?</p> <p>Of course I'm in favour of anything that encourages young people to become independent theatregoers. Theatre is very much a habit, and one that many lose as soon as they leave school and the annual trip to the local panto and Stomp! behind.</p> <p>Organisations such as <a href=\"http://www.mousetrap.org.uk/\">The Mousetrap Foundation</a> that encourage young people to choose, book and make their way to theatres on their own - rather than in a school or family party - are invaluable because they encourage teenagers to do it for themselves. The numbers of teenagers standing at the Globe is an indication that price does matter when it comes to buying theatre tickets.</p> <p>But price is not the only factor. Large numbers of young people simply don't think that the theatre is for them, and may well end up having that view confirmed if they turned up on a Monday night to see Turandot at Hampstead theatre or were unfortunate enough to get Afterlife rather than War Horse at the National - or, indeed, are forced to deal with the <a href=\"http://www.rsc.org.uk/buyonline/2656.aspx\">mysteries of the RSC advance booking system</a>.<br> McMaster's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/jan/11/theatrenews.artsfunding\">thinking about providing free access to arts venues</a> was clearly influenced by the rise in visitor numbers experienced by by museums and galleries in 2001. Yes, there were increases, but a significant number of those visitors were those who were already going to museums and who started going more often once it was free. Similarly, schemes such as the Travelex seasons at the National are brilliant for box office and encouraging people to take a chance on a play that they might otherwise not risk, but I've yet to see evidence that they widen the demographic of theatregoers rather than simply encourage already committed, university-educated audiences to go more often.</p> <p>If young people are going to engage with theatre, it's not just the price that has to be right. It has to be the programming, the environment and a culture that makes them feel comfortable and welcome. For that, theatres and government must look to models such as Contact in Manchester, the work of independent touring companies such as Pilot and the participation schemes of venues such as BAC. And our entire education system has to be overhauled so that creativity and engagement with the arts by every child is valued as much as Sats results and league tables.</p>",
  "<p>It seems odd to think about it now, but this time last year, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordonbrown\">Gordon Brown</a> was riding the crest of a wave, buoyed up by high opinion-poll ratings and much praise for the first three months of his premiership. The big issue at that time was whether he would seek to capitalise on his position by calling a snap general election. </p> <p>With the collapse that followed, those pushing for an early poll were damned as reckless young hotheads. From the vantage point of today, they look more like prophets of common sense and good judgment. In the election that never was, Labour would either have won narrowly, giving itself five years to sit out the economic downturn, or it would have lost narrowly, offering the real hope of a quick return to power as David Cameron wrestled with the consequences of the financial crisis. Ministers would chew their arms off for either scenario today.</p> <p>The big issue a year later is whether Gordon Brown can survive until Christmas. Many people talk as if this <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labourleadership\">crisis of Brown's leadership</a> was preordained, but the honeymoon of enthusiasm that came to an end a year ago suggests otherwise. People looked at their new prime minister and liked what they saw \u2013 or at least thought they saw. In particular, they liked the idea of change he claimed to represent. The story of his decline is one of failure to live up to that promise. </p> <p>There are other factors, of course. Any government in power during an economic downturn of the current proportions should expect to take a major hit. This is especially true of New Labour, which appeared to sign up with genuine ideological zeal to the very economic orthodoxies that have failed so spectacularly. Under any leader, Labour today would be in pretty bad shape, something that is tacitly recognised in the failure of a challenger to come forward. None of the likely candidates seems sure that he or she could do much better in the current environment. </p> <p>Yes, Brown has been indecisive and inept at times. But this is not the main cause of Labour's woes; nor is his personality.</p> <p>In casting the debate about its future in terms of personalities, Labour looks trivial and out of touch, something that only deepens the public mood against it. The fact is that the disgruntled Blairites calling loudest for Brown to go are the ones with least cause to complain about his political direction. Indeed, with the exception of reclassifying cannabis and scrapping the supercasino, it is very hard to think of a single decision in the last 15 months that Tony Blair would have taken differently. Nor, it seems, do the rebels have a single political criticism to make of Brown. </p> <p>They don't hate him because he isn't a Blairite \u2013 he is. They hate him because he isn't Blair.</p> <p>Brown has to take some responsibility for the degree of personal animosity he arouses. People he treated quite brutally in his rise to the top are now returning the favour as he passes them in the opposite direction. Charles Clarke and Frank Field are loving every minute of it. The moral of the story is that winning isn't everything in politics: <em>how</em> you win also counts. Even so, the fact that Labour can divide so bitterly on a non-political basis raises serious concerns about its fitness to govern.</p> <p>Brown's options <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/23/gordonbrown.labour\">as he addresses</a> Labour conference are, therefore, very limited. A safe speech peppered with the usual micro-initiatives will only convince voters that both he and Labour have run out of steam. The absence of an ambitious policy agenda will also keep the focus on issues of leadership and personality. </p> <p>Instead, he needs to recapture the idea that he can be an agent of change at a time when many of the assumptions on which British politics has been conducted over the last three decades have collapsed. The implications of the financial crisis are a major problem for all three political parties. But for the one that is most imaginative in setting out the need for a new economic model, it is also a huge opportunity. </p> <p>Labour's ability to understand that is its last chance to avert disaster.</p>",
  "<p>The American Office is back on American TV. And all the Americans I know are <a href=\"http://www.brainsoap.com/articles/17587/film--tv\">rabbiting on</a> about how it's the greatest show on TV ever.</p> <p>It clearly isn't. Not when <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/S/starstories/\">Star Stories</a> is on BBC America. But you can see why they're excited. The Office deals with race and alienation and the sheer banality of everyday life in a way that is truly revolutionary for the American sitcom. And this excites a certain part of America greatly.</p> <p>This year saw the second <a href=\"http://www.theofficeconvention.com\">Office convention</a> in Scranton - the boring town in northeast Pennsylvania that stands in for the Brit original's Slough (even though it's actually shot in California.)</p> <p>Scranton has also become the new <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peoria,_Illinois\">Peoria</a> - the legendary political litmus test for the US presidential election. It came to prominence during the primaries as Hilary Clinton's (sorta) hometown. Turns out that Democratic vice-presidential candidate <a href=\"http://www.politickerpa.com/alexroarty/1559/obama-camp-pushes-bidens-scranton-roots\">Joe Biden is also (kinda) from Scranton</a>. And so - with grim inevitability - \"hard scrabble\" Scranton changed from a boring shithole that nobody cared about, into a marvelous microcosm of authentic, blue collar, domestic beer drinking, \"hard working\" America; and was namechecked by Democrats and Republicans alike as exactly the sort of <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/08/scranton_is_the_new_peoria.html\">economically-depressed, white, working class dump</a> Obama has to win to have any chance of becoming president.</p> <p>A few weeks ago - following mentions by both <a href=\"http://www.wnep.com/Global/story.asp?S=9050014&amp;nav=\" menu158_2\" \">McCain and Palin</a> - the media descended on Scranton to interview every single one of its 77,000 bemused denizens a dozen times over. And every single one of the resulting articles, blogs and TV and radio pieces mentioned the Office. And these in turn inspired another flurry of articles reminding us that that the American version of the Office is great - because, just like Scranton, it's for real.</p> <p>It's not. It's rubbish. The American Office is a dysfunctional and unfunny pastiche of the original. When the British version first aired, I met several Americans who thought it was a documentary. \"Is England really that awful?\" asked one. Where the original is nail-bitingly excruciating, the US Office - dumbed down to the point of being insulting - is comfort food for liberals.</p> <p>Steve Carell's character (a cuddly, clownish version of Ricky Gervais' David Brent) makes a clumsily off-colour comment about race, the camera cuts to the black guy. Just in case you missed the fact that Steve Carell's character has said something about black people that the makers of the show think is wrong. Because you're stupid, presumably.</p> <p>When the original Office was shown on US TV, BBC America plugged it with a street interview with an enthusiastic US fan who said: \"If you don't see some of yourself in David Brent, then you are David Brent.\"</p> <p>The same simply can't be said of Steve Carell's two-dimensional and entirely unsympathetic Michael Scott. He's an Aunt Sally. A straightforward sad bastard to be straightforwardly laughed at. In short, where the BritOffice had you hiding behind the sofa AmeriOffice has you falling asleep on it. And yet it is huge.</p> <p>Plus there's Incredible Hulk syndrome - named after the moment when you realised that Bruce Banner was never going to find the cure for turning green and going mental. Where the Brit office had a natural two series (and a Christmas special) story arc, its US offspring - now seemingly in its gazillionth dead-donkey flogging season - will most likely keep hamfistedly hammering the same two shrill notes on the comedy organ for years to come. Will wotsit ever get off with thingy? Seriously, it's been three years now, who cares?</p> <p>But the number one reason the AmeriOffice sucks is that it simply doesn't need to exist.</p> <p>The opening of Ricky Gervais' (apparently not that fantastic) Hollywood vehicle <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/trailers/paramount/ghosttown/\">Ghost Town</a> has encouraged America's AmeriOffice haters to come tumbling out of the closet. <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2200397\">Slate.com's reviewer</a> wrote: \"I'm one of those Office purists who still refuses to watch the American version; why remake perfection?\"</p> <p>That's a great question. And the answer is that the idiots who run US television think US viewers are drooling idiots utterly incapable of understanding a foreign-made show until it's been homogenised and stripped of any cultural reference that might puzzle, confuse or pique the curiosity of some mythical, mono-cultural Yankee Doodle everyperson.</p> <p>There is a T-shirt that says: \"The British version of this T-shirt is much funnier\". In the case of the Office, that T-shirt tells the truth.</p>",
  "<p><em>Ban Ki-Moon is secretary general of the United Nations</em></p> <p>We all recognise today's perils. A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketturmoil\">global financial crisis</a>. A global energy crisis. A global food crisis. Trade talks have <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/markets/2793938/Doha-world-trade-talks-collapse-in-blow-to-globalisation.html\">collapsed</a>, yet again.</p> <p>There are new outbreaks of war and violence. Climate change ever more clearly threatens our planet. We say that global problems demand global solutions.</p> <p>And yet, do we act? In truth, today, we also face a crisis of a different sort \u2013 the challenge of global leadership. New centres of power and leadership are emerging \u2013 in Asia, Latin America and across the newly developed world.</p> <p>In this new world, the challenges are increasingly those of collaboration, not confrontation. Nations can no longer protect their interests, or advance the wellbeing of their people, without the partnership of the rest.</p> <p>Yet I see a danger of nations looking inward rather than toward a shared future. I see a danger of retreating from the progress we have made, particularly in the realm of economic development and fairness in sharing the fruits of global growth.</p> <p>Yes, global growth has raised billions of people out of poverty. Yet if you are among the world's poor, you have never felt poverty so sharply. Yes, international law and justice have never been so widely embraced. Yet those living in nations where human rights are abused have never been so vulnerable.</p> <p>Yes, most of us live in peace and security. Yet violence is deepening in many nations: Afghanistan, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Iraq, and Sudan.</p> <p>Their problems are part of the development emergency we face. Over the past year, the price of fuel, food, and commodities rose alarmingly. Wealthy countries worry about recession, while the poor can no longer afford to eat.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.undp.org/mdg/\">millennium development goals</a> are part of the solution. But progress here has been uneven. Pledges have not been honoured. Yet we have achieved enough to know that the goals are within reach.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.un.org/ga/\">United Nations</a> is the champion of the most vulnerable. When disaster strikes, we act. We did so this year in <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-09-10-Haiti-floods_N.htm\">Haiti</a> and other Caribbean nations hit by hurricanes. We did so after Cyclone Nargis in Myanmar, where the challenge now is to push for political progress, including credible steps on human rights and democracy.</p> <p>We have helped people affected by severe flooding in south-east Asia, and by drought in the Horn of Africa, where 14 million need emergency help. Since taking office, I have called for more strenuous action in Somalia. Must we wait \u2013 and see more children die in the sand?</p> <p>The global food crisis will not go away by itself. It may now have faded from the headlines. Last year at this time, rice cost $330 a ton. Today it is $730. People who used to buy rice by the bag now do so by the handful. Those who ate two meals a day now get by on one.</p> <p>The UN has focused on getting seeds and fertilisers into the hands of small farmers. We seek a new \"green revolution\" in Africa. But we lack new resources. The international community has not matched words with deeds.</p> <p>In Burundi and Sierra Leone, Liberia and Timor Leste, our resources are under strain because UN peacekeepers are helping nations turn the corner to peace. Yet the UN's preventive diplomacy is often critical. We see the fruits in Nepal, Kenya and, we hope, Zimbabwe.</p> <p>Likewise, there is a real chance to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/11/cyprus.greece\">reunify Cyprus</a>. In Georgia, the UN can help ease the tensions resulting from the recent conflict. In Cote d'Ivoire, we will help organise elections before year's end \u2013 a major stride toward recovery and democracy.</p> <p>But it is dangerous to think that the UN can address today's complex problems without the full backing of its member states. In Darfur, for example, we face a continuing challenge in meeting deployment deadlines. We lack critical assets and personnel. If not matched by resources, mandates are empty.</p> <p>And now all of our work \u2013 financing for development, social spending in rich nations and poor, the millennium development goals, peacekeeping \u2013 is endangered by the global financial crisis. We need to restore order to international financial markets. We must think about a new global economic order that more fully reflects the changing realities of our time.</p> <p>Those realities call for continuous UN action on countless fronts: combating malaria and Aids, reducing maternal and child mortality, fighting global terrorism, and ensuring nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. On the Korean peninsula, all the agreements of the six-party talks must be implemented, and Iran must comply with security council resolutions and cooperate fully with the International Atomic Energy Agency.</p> <p>The area of human rights, above all, demands our vigilance. Justice must be treated as a pillar of peace, security, and development. We must advance the \"responsibility to protect.\" Despite the real political difficulties, we cannot let crimes against humanity go unpunished.</p> <p>Climate change remains the defining issue of our era. We must regain our momentum. Our first test comes in three months in <a href=\"http://www.poznan2008.com/\">Poznan</a>, Poland. By then, we need a shared vision of a new global climate change agreement to replace the Kyoto Protocol, which runs out in 2012.</p> <p>The foundation of all the UN's work is accountability. We need to change the UN's culture. We must become faster, more flexible, and more effective \u2013 more modern. We must replace our current system of contracts and conditions of service, which are dysfunctional and demoralising.</p> <p>But the UN's member states must be accountable as well. Resolutions mandating peace operations cannot continue to be passed without the necessary troops, money, and material. We cannot send brave UN staff \u2013 25 of whom died this year \u2013 around the world without assuring their security. We cannot reform this organisation without the required resources.</p> <p>Today's uncertainties will pass, but only if we act wisely and responsibly. By doing so, we will set the stage for a new era of stability and global prosperity, more widely and equitably shared. </p> <p>In cooperation with <a href=\"www.project-syndicate.org\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2008.</p>",
  "<p>The Financial Services Authority's crackdown on short selling today forced a number of City funds, including Barclays Global Investors and Odey Asset Management, to admit <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/apr/'12/businessglossary137\">shorting</a> financial companies.</p> <p>Following the crackdown announced late last week, Barclays Global Investors, the asset management arm of Barclays, said it had a short position on Friday amounting to 0.37% of the share capital of St James's Place, which is 59% owned by high street rival HBOS.</p> <p>Odey Asset Management, which runs eight hedge funds and is based in London, said it held a short position amounting to 0.35% of Investec's shares that day. Odey was criticised earlier this summer when it was outed as one of the funds shorting Bradford &amp; Bingley in the midst of its \u00a3400m rights issue.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/05/executivesalaries.investing\">Founder Crispin Odey </a>has run the firm since he quit Barings Bank in 1991. He recently paid himself almost \u00a328m after a year in which he was one of a few financiers to navigate the credit crunch successfully. He is married to Nichola Pease, who runs the fund manager JO Hambro and is a member of one of the founding families of Barclays bank. They are one of the most powerful couples in the City, worth \u00a3300m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List, and are often referred to as the Posh 'n' Becks of the financial services sector. </p> <p>The $35bn New York hedge fund Paulson &amp; Co \u2014 last year's most successful hedge fund after its bet against subprime mortgages \u2014 has had short positions in four of Britain's big high street banks, amounting to 0.87% of RBS's outstanding shares, 1.76% of Lloyds TSB's shares, 1.18% of Barclays' share capital and 0.95% of HBOS's shares.</p> <p>US hedge fund Eton Park International was short in 0.28% of HSBC's share capital yesterday.</p> <p>On Thursday night, after the market closed, the FSA imposed a temporary ban on creating new short positions in 28 companies, later increased to 32. It also set a deadline of 3.30pm today for short sellers of a group of financial stocks to declare any existing short positions.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/19/marketturmoil.wallstreet\">28 company stocks </a>named by the City regulator saw their share prices soar on Friday, partly because hedge funds scrambled to buy shares that they had previously gone short on. Short selling involves selling borrowed shares in the hope that the price will fall and they can be bought back at a profit later on.</p> <p>Fortelus said its Special Situations Master Fund held a short position amounting to 5.33% of London Scottish Bank's share capital last Friday. Fortelus, based close to Pall Mall in London, is an investment fund specialising in European distressed debt and equity. London Scottish Bank runs doorstep loan services, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/feb/27/banking\">suspended new lending in February after racking up losses</a>.</p> <p>New York-based Calypso admitted it short sold 3.7m shares in Anglo Irish Bank, or 0.49% of the bank's shares. Lansdowne Partners, the London hedge fund which manages more than $19bn, also had a short position in the bank yesterday amounting to 1.63% of the shares. </p> <p>Kynikos Associates was short in 3.86m shares in Anglo Irish, and 5.6m shares in Bank of Ireland today. Kynikos, named for the Greek word for cynic, has been run by Jim Chanos in New York since 1985 and, with $4bn, is the largest fund dedicated to short selling, according to a book published last year entitled Hedge Hunters.</p> <p>The FSA has been criticised over its short-selling crackdown. In a letter to the Financial Times published today, Alan Richards, managing director of West Hill Corporate Finance, wrote that the recent surge in online trading suggested it was not only hedge funds that have been shorting wounded bank stocks. </p> <p>\"The wide availability and uptake of contracts for difference and financial spread-betting accounts means that tens of thousands of private individuals acting with the same intent could have an impact similar to that of a few large hedge funds,\" he wrote. \"Hedge funds intent on busting a bank have options other than short selling the equity. For example, driving up credit default swap spreads does the job well.\"</p>",
  "<p>A new study has shown that our addiction to the car doesn't just harm the atmosphere, it also hits much closer to home. <a href=\"http://www.livingstreets.org.uk/what_you_can_do/content/traffic.php\">Researchers</a> at the University of the West of England have found that people who live in busy roads have fewer friends and acquaintances nearby, and feel worse about their neighbourhoods, than those in socio-economically similar but less traffic-filled streets. As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/19/ethicalliving.automotive\">John Vidal</a> reported in last Friday's Guardian, the consequences could be far-reaching, given the <a href=\"http://www.nice.org.uk/niceMedia/documents/CHB21-social-capital.pdf\">links (pdf)</a> between neighbourliness and positive outcomes in many areas of people's lives.</p> <p>Traffic-filled streets are a double whammy for children. Road danger is a direct and lethal threat, and a realistic fear for parents, especially in the UK, which has a <a href=\"http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/statistics/datatablespublications/accidents/casualtiesgbar/roadcasualtiesgreatbritain2006\">poor record</a> on child pedestrian casualties compared to most other European countries. But car dependence also impoverishes children's lives, severing their links with the people and places around them. </p> <p>A moment's reflection on our own childhoods will remind us how important our neighbourhoods were in shaping our sense of ourselves. Everyday adventures in streets, parks and other local outdoor spaces gave us the chance to learn and grow through our own efforts, gradually exploring and making sense of the people and places around us. Neighbourliness is vital to giving children the opportunity to have these kinds of experiences. Parents simply won't let their kids out of the house if they feel the world beyond their front doors is uninterested or \u2013 worse still \u2013 hostile. </p> <p>Childhood today is far more restricted than in previous generations. And as I argue in my book <a href=\"http://www.gulbenkian.org.uk/publications/education/no-fear\">No Fear</a>, one of the key reasons is because we lead such atomised, car-dependent lives. For many people of all ages, the only part of their neighbourhood they are familiar with is the five-yard stretch from their front door to the door of their car. </p> <p>In one recent study, children in Australia \u2013 where suburban sprawl makes car ownership essential \u2013 were given digital cameras and asked to submit images that captured their daily lives. Fully half of the group included photos of the insides of cars. Is it any wonder children appear to be ever more disengaged? </p> <p>The point about traffic is that it is one area of public policy where the politicians have direct access to the key levers of change, through the planning system. Yet we have lost faith in the very idea that planning is a good way to tackle complex social problems. As a result, government policies are vague and wishy-washy at best, and local authorities don't have the political will to challenge the status quo. As a result, children are left exposed to the brutal market forces of individual adult choices.</p> <p>In many other European countries, city planners have a strong voice, while the planning system as a whole is demonstrably shaped by values about what makes communities healthy and cohesive. And I'm not just thinking of the Nordic states here. The mayor of Stuttgart - Germany's Motor City, note - declared in 2006 that making his city more child- and family-friendly is a top priority. For him, it is a matter of hard-nosed economic realities: if families move away, his city's economy will weaken. So his planners have begun a programme of improving urban residential areas. One project turned a car park into an attractive green space and play area. </p> <p>We in the UK urgently need to revive the belief that city building and urban design can make a difference to people's lives.

  "<p>The German zookeeper who hand-reared <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/knut\">Knut</a> the polar bear and helped turn the animal into a global celebrity has been found dead in his Berlin flat, police said today.</p> <p>Thomas D\u00f6rflein was said to have been seriously ill for some time, and officers do not believe any foul play was involved.</p> <p>D\u00f6rflein became Knut's surrogate parent when the cub was rejected by his mother, Tosca, after being born at the Zoologischer Garten Berlin in December 2006.</p> <p>Thanks to round-the-clock care from the 44-year-old, who hand-fed Knut and slept in the same cage, the polar bear cub became the first at the zoo to survive past infancy for more than 30 years.</p> <p>Knut-mania gripped the world last March when D\u00f6rflein accompanied the cub on his first public appearance in front of the global media. </p> <p>The ensuing attention turned the bear and his keeper into media stars. Knut appeared on the cover of a German edition of Vanity Fair, and his popularity drew record numbers of visitors to the zoo.</p> <p>D\u00f6rflein and Knut built a special rapport, and the bearded zookeeper was rarely seen without the white bear following close behind.</p> <p>As Knut grew, however, it became too dangerous for D\u00f6rflein to play with him. Last November, the zoo decided it would be best if all contact between the two was cut off.</p> <p>Not everyone had appreciated D\u00f6rflein's work. Some animal rights activists argued that Knut should have been killed rather than turned into a \"domestic pet\", and others claim the animal is showing signs of disturbed behaviour.</p> <p>Last year, D\u00f6rflein, a father of three, was awarded the Medal of Merit by the city of Berlin for his work in rearing Knut and raising the zoo's profile.</p>",
  "<p>It was a cunning if not a little overdue move on <strong><a href=\"http://www.joost.com/\">Joost's</a></strong> part to transform its online video service from a standalone piece of software to a web-based service that needs just a browser plugin.

  "<p>Is rugby union careering down football's slippery slope? All the warning signs are there for those who care to look. In the past four days alone we have had Premiership coaches accused of influencing referees; the latest flare-up in the age-old club versus country debate; England's star player stirring up a tabloid frenzy and the increasingly likely prospect of Bath moving to Swindon Town FC. \"There is no doubt in my mind that, whether we like it or not, rugby will go the same way as soccer,\" warned the Saracens' chairman Nigel Wray, suggesting only the rich would ultimately be able to compete with Europe's elite.</p> <p>Some will shrug their shoulders and wonder why anyone is remotely bothered. Footballers' wages are not to be sneezed at and off-shore investment is already a fact of life in English club rugby, not least at Saracens and London Irish. If rugby can sell its product to Sky for millions more than is currently the case, everyone should be happy, right? And what's the problem with Swindon when Bristol Rovers, Wycombe Wanderers, Stockport County, Reading and Watford already host Premiership rugby? On the head, son, you know you want to.</p> <p>So why the creeping sense of unease? It has nothing to do with pining for the old amateur days. There is no desire to see players revert to the status of feudal underlings, even if the genuine entertainers and characters are starting to thin out to a worrying degree. It is simply a sense that, by meekly following the football blueprint, rugby is in danger of missing a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to plough its own singular furrow and retain an unique identity, the essence of every successful new business.</p> <p>This may well be a rubbish analogy but let's compare sport to confectionery. Football is the chewing gum of the masses, capable of providing instant satisfaction yet too often ending in sticky aggravation. Rugby league is a bit like a Marathon; they call it a Snickers nowadays but floating voters still have a love-hate relationship with it. And professional club rugby union? Currently it resembles Green and Black's chocolate: a high-quality success story in danger of selling its soul and, in doing so, of losing its raison d'etre. If rugby union ends up being staged in segregated football stadiums, between teams wearing vomit-inducing fluorescent shirts, with a dumbed-down set of laws that render different nationalities almost indistinguishable, it can hardly complain if its core audience decides it is seen enough and defects to a more rewarding weekend pastime.</p> <p>The next couple of years, therefore, are vital. Never mind the cash-strapped southern hemisphere, the British game cannot afford another debilitating series of rows over player availability; either the impoverished Scottish Rugby Union will have to strike some kind of deal with Premier Rugby for the use of its exiled club players outside international weeks, as the Rugby Football Union has belatedly done, or risk alienating a public already lukewarm to the concept of paying to watch professional rugby. The International Board must also dismount its high horse occasionally and work more closely with the clubs for the collective good; if that means a slight reduction in the number of Test matches that need not necessarily be a bad thing.</p> <p>And if rugby wants a half-decent case study to ponder it should resist football's siren call and take a glance halfway across the globe. Australian rugby may be operating on shifting sands but, coincidentally, Australian Rules football has many of the attributes European club rugby should aspire to. In Melbourne they are awaiting this weekend's grand final between Hawthorn and Geelong with a fervour that makes the Ryder Cup resemble a vicarage tea party. It is no longer just a game for Victorians. The international dimension, admittedly, is barely discernible but even rugby league-led Sydney is increasingly keen. Attend a big game and the first thing you notice, in contrast to British soccer, is the warm family atmosphere. It is parochial yet big time, deeply serious yet fun to attend. Even the ball is an acceptable shape. The AFL is structured and run in a way which makes it make it hard for one or two clubs to dominate in perpetuity and the crowds, partially as a result of affordable ticket prices, are huge. No wonder the ARU is worried.</p> <p>The business model, clearly, is more complex in Europe, particularly given the largely unfettered financial clout of the big French clubs. Nor is anyone suggesting that all rugby players should wear tank tops or that the IRB should do away with crossbars from January 1. But rugby union, contrary to popular belief, is still in control its own destiny. An acquaintance went to see Fulham and Harlequins play on successive weekends last season and could hardly believe how much more he and his son enjoyed their day at the more welcoming, inclusive Twickenham Stoop. If rugby wants to ape football's every move, fine. Before its rulers head down that dispiriting route, however, they should at least pause to weigh up the alternatives.</p> <h2>Trying stuff</h2> <p>Three rounds of Guinness Premiership league matches gone and already some intriguing themes are surfacing. So far there have been only two try bonus points scored in 18 games, the exceptions to the general rule coming at the expense of the two weakest teams, Bristol and Newcastle. Sale are second in the table on points difference having scored just one try in 240 minutes and conceded none. It is fair to say the ELVs are not encouraging a free-wheeling frenzy of attacking rugby.</p> <h2> Exiles on Main Street</h2> <p>You may have spotted that The Guardian is now publishing a collated \"team of the weekend\" from the Premiership. It is a subjective exercise, clearly, and for some reason we managed to list Bath's Michael Lipman as playing for Saracens in Monday's paper. For practical reasons, too, it is not yet possible to incorporate the Celtic League into the selection process. Looking down our first weekend XV, something else is immediately apparent. Of the 15 names chosen, there were only four English-qualified players. It will be interesting to see if that meagre ratio is maintained or was merely a blip.</p>",
  "<p>Police have named the army recruit found hanged at an army camp just a mile away from the controversial Deepcut barracks, where four recruits died amid allegations of chronic bullying.</p> <p>Anthony Manuel Jose Hernandez, 29, from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, was found dead on Sunday at Alexander barracks in Pirbright, Surrey. It is understood he arrived at the training centre just a few days ago. A spokeswoman from Surrey police said there was no evidence of any third-party involvement in his death.</p> <p>At Deepcut barracks, Sean Benton, 20, James Collinson, 17, Geoff Gray, 17, and Cheryl James, 18, died from bullet wounds in separate incidents between 1995 and 2002. The army says the deaths were all suicides, but the soldiers' parents have disputed the claim. </p> <p>An investigation into the Deepcut deaths cleared the army of bullying. Under pressure to improve its treatment of new recruits, however, the army opened Alexander barracks this year. They were designed to offer modern, comfortable accommodation and better welfare arrangements. </p> <p>In order to provide more privacy, the 12-person, dormitory-style rooms are partitioned into four areas. Each floor has a \"duty of care\" office and a member of training staff. The barracks also have in place specific policies to identify and prevent bullying.</p> <p>Des and Doreen James, the parents of Private James, who was found dead from a single gunshot wound at Deepcut in 1995, yesterday expressed their condolences to Hernandez's family and renewed their calls for a full public inquiry into the Deepcut deaths.</p> <p>In a joint statement, they said: \"It seems clearer than ever that until there is a public inquiry into the deaths at Deepcut, we the public can never know for sure what it is that creates an environment where such terrible events continually occur.</p> <p>\"Until we are allowed to openly consider and challenge the facts, the influences that create a culture which allows so many young people to lose their lives, there will never be a trust that the Ministry of Defence (MoD) have in place the most appropriate or effective corrective actions to prevent such tragedies reoccurring.\"</p> <p>A MoD spokesman said: \"We take our responsibility to ensure the wellbeing and safety of all our personnel very seriously.</p> <p>\"Nicholas Blake QC conducted an extensive independent inquiry into the tragic deaths of the four service personnel at Deepcut and concluded that no new reliable evidence as to how the four soldiers met their deaths is likely to be available.</p> <p>\"His view, and ours, given the extensive investigations that have taken place, is that there is no public interest in pursuing a public inquiry.\"</p> <p>An inquest into Hernandez's death will be opened and adjourned at Woking coroners court this morning, police said.</p>",

Among the pearls of Goldman wisdom is his injunction to make the script \"a reading experience\". This is particularly important when it comes to the setting.</p> <p>The setting is all about making the reader believe in the world you are trying to create. I emphasise reader because it's easy to forget that the screenplay's first audience is made up of readers - producers, script executives, development people, financiers, directors and actors. </p> <p>I see a lot of scripts written in the minimalist Hollywood style. In the worst of these, stage directions are terse and make little effort to create the illusion that this world is real. For me, research is key. I want to know as much as I possibly can about the world my characters are going to inhabit. </p> <p>When I was working on Public Enemies, about the bank robber John Dillinger, Michael Mann insisted that I not only visit the actual locations, but that I also spend a day driving vintage cars on a lot in LA. He didn't have to insist too hard.</p> <p>The trick - not an easy one - is not to be a slave to your research, but to use it to give yourself the confidence to create vivid, compelling pictures in the reader's head. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Ronan Bennett's screenplays include Rebel Heart and Hamburg Cell</p>",
  "<p>The number of mortgages approved for home purchases hit a record low in August, figures showed today, as falling house prices, a poor economic climate and speculation about stamp duty put the housing market on hold.</p> <p>Just 21,086 people took out loans to purchase homes - less than two-thirds of the average for the past six months, according to the British Bankers' Association (BBA). The number of people remortgaging also fell to 47,765 compared with a six-month average of 66,626.</p> <p>Lending levels also slowed and are now the lowest they have been since February 2001. Net mortgage lending rose by \u00a32.1bn in the month, compared with \u00a34.8bn in July and an average of \u00a34.7bn over the past six months.</p> <p>\"Falling property prices, economic pressures on households, tighter lending criteria and anticipation of the government's announcement on stamp duty all suppressed or delayed demand in August and will continue having an impact in the months ahead,\" said David Dooks, BBA statistics director. </p> <p>The chancellor, Alistair Darling, announced in the first week of September that stamp duty would be suspended on properties costing up to \u00a3185,000 for a year.</p> <p>Howard Archer, chief UK economist at Global Insight, said the data was \"really dismal\", and warned that the current financial sector turmoil was likely to \"deepen the pressure on housing market activity\" as lenders will be forced to tighten lending criteria further.</p> <p>Archer predicted house prices would fall by 15% in 2008 and 12% in 2009.</p> <p>\"The BBA data graphically highlight that housing market activity continues to be throttled by stretched affordability and tight lending conditions. Widespread expectations that house prices will continue to fall markedly for some considerable time to come is also significantly limiting housing market activity, as is heightened concern over the economic outlook and job prospects,\" he said. </p> <p>Meanwhile, consumer borrowing on credit cards rose slightly in August, up to \u00a37.3bn compared with \u00a37.2bn in July, but in line with the six-month average. However, repayments on credit cards outstripped borrowing as consumers paid back \u00a37.4bn.</p> <p>Borrowing on loans and overdrafts also fell by 23.9% compared with August 2007 to \u00a32.1bn.</p> <p>\"Monthly fluctuations in consumer credit and deposits reflect the behaviour of families repaying as much as they spend on credit cards and using their current accounts for expenditure,\" said Dooks.</p>",
  "<p>Reviews by pupils of Westbourne School, Sheffield, the winning school in this year's Guardian Young Critics award</p> <p><strong>Olivia Moore, 13</strong><br><strong>Before I Die by Jenny Downham</strong></p> <p>Before I Die by Jenny Downham is incredibly touching and a very deep book. It is full of emotion and meaning. This excellently written book is about a girl with a perfectly good life until she finds out she has terminal cancer and everything starts changing.</p> <p>Tessa only has a few months to live so she makes a list of ten things she wants to do before she dies, some of which are sex, drugs and doing something illegal. Another main character, Zoey, plays a big part in this book, being Tessa's best friend, and promises Tessa that she will do everything on her list with her, until Zoey starts acting strangely and has some important news that she tries to hide from Tessa.</p> <p>When Tessa goes into hospital a few weeks before she dies, she writes a list of instructions for her family and friends for after she dies.</p> <p>I really enjoyed this book because it got my full attention after the first few pages; it really grasped me. It just got straight to the point with some extra, but needed, information on the side.</p> <p>I truly recommend this book to readers who want a change in their reading material.</p> <p>This book is so real but so sad and so very true.</p> <p><strong>Beth Butler, 13</strong><br><strong>The Goldsmith's Daughter by Tanya Landman</strong></p> <p>This is the story of Itacate, who defies tradition and risks her life to pursue her dreams. According to the priests she is destined for a worthless life and to bring ill fortune to those closest to her. She is determined to prove the priests wrong using her great skill as a goldsmith. </p> <p>The story becomes more complicated when she falls in love with one of the Spanish invaders. The author, Tanya Landman, has broadly based the story on 16th-century Mexico but has altered some of the sequence of events.</p> <p>The book is well written and I think it gives a good insight into the Aztecs' life and how everything was done to please the gods in a personal, exciting and interesting way. </p> <p>I think this is a unique book. I haven't read one like it before but I would definitely read it again even though I know the story. I would recommend this book for girls and boys who like excitement in a historical and cultural setting. </p> <p>The story is written in the first person, which is good because it means that when she can't show her emotions you still know her secrets and how she is feeling, in some detail. A range of emotions was evoked in me from cheerful and excited to dejected. </p> <p>Some descriptive passages I found too detailed and I felt should have not been there as the story would still be understandable. </p> <p>Itacate's character develops throughout the book. At the beginning she is almost contented with the way she lives but as the book goes on we see her getting more wild and wanting to be free. The ending is wonderful with all the threads of the story tied together.</p> <p><strong>Robert Brooks, 13</strong><br><strong>The Knife of Never Letting Go by Patrick Ness</strong></p> <p>The Knife of Never Letting Go, written by Patrick Ness, is a wonderful story about a young boy escaping his childhood and becoming a man in a world where everybody can hear each other's thoughts.</p> <p>This is a heart-warming coming-of-age story with a twist of fantasy. This book would appeal to all children aged 13 and over, so long as they don't mind a hefty story.</p> <p>The book starts off funny \u2013 it describes how quickly you find out how little a dog has to say when it starts to talk \u2013 but then gets sadder as the deaths start occurring.</p> <p>There are some beautiful descriptions of the world the boy is passing through, even if some words are misspelt; the boy telling the story can barely read or write so complicated words are spelt how they sound.</p> <p>I loved The Knife of Never Letting Go, and will be buying the rest of the trilogy as soon as they are published. I just hope that they are as good as this one.</p> <p><strong>Tommie Hassali, 13</strong><br><strong>Bad Blood by Rhiannon Lassiter</strong></p> <p>Rhiannon Lassiter's Bad Blood follows the emotions of Catriona, Katherine, Roley and John who wrestle with the personalities of their new stepfamily. A holiday in the Lake District only heightens their feelings towards one another when they become players in the Make-Believe Game. A game awakened by their own unhappiness brings to life Delilah, a sinister doll and Fox who destroys the boundaries of reality and fantasy. The game intensifies when Alice, whose family holds its own mystery, becomes a victim of the wood.</p> <p>John, the youngest and wisest, leads them from the darkness. Gently, quietly he understands the strategy of the game and that only by reinventing themselves will they be rescued from the horror that engulfs their world.</p> <p>The book's pace is riveting. It holds the reader in the haunting world of the supernatural but at the same time does not shy from the reality of the modern day family, and the subjects of homosexuality and mental illness. Amidst these strands emerge the very real difficulties facing adolescents and their awareness of themselves and each other.</p> <p>The book and the characters emerge from a suffocating darkness to a golden light of emotions that will radiate hope in all who read it.<br></p>",

  "<p>Now that US financial woes have given way to a full-blown meltdown on Wall Street, whither the major Hollywood studios' co-financing arrangements with investment institutions and wealthy private individuals? Well, seeing as two more deals were announced yesterday that will directly affect the Big Six it would appear that co-financing is here to stay. The question is, in what form and to what extent?</p> <p>According to several people in entertainment financing, the wave of economic Darwinism that has been lapping against Tinseltown's shores ever since the credit crunch will intensify. Out will go the clueless investors looking for write-offs in exchange for quick returns and premiere party tickets, while the sage long-term players will stick around and continue to prosper. At least that's the theory... and we all know what Hollywood does with sheets of paper containing attractive writing.</p> <p>For years now Tinseltown has used co-financing as a device to mitigate the risk of multi-million dollar investments in film projects. Smaller production companies have rallied together to stump up production costs since the dawn of time and in the last decade or so the major studios - all studios, in fact - have got in on the act. The multimedia conglomerates that own the six majors rightly regard their film divisions as loss leaders and have urged prudent outlay. Share the cost and share the reward, as they say \u2013 except on surefire winners like Harry Potter, Spider-Man and James Bond, which the<br>studios prefer to keep for themselves. They're clever like that.</p> <p>According to the Motion Picture Association Of America (MPAA) \u2013 the lobby group that coordinates Hollywood's anti-piracy offensive, urges Congress to negotiate tough trade tariffs and sets film ratings, among other things \u2013 the average cost for an MPAA-affiliated studio to produce and market a film in 2007 was just over $106m. For the studios' specialty divisions the figure was $74.9m. That's a lot of money, hence, to name a few, Fox Filmed Entertainment's co-financing arrangement with Dune Entertainment, Universal and Sony's deals with Relativity Media and Warner Bros' pact with Legendary Pictures, whose principals will have greeted the success of The Dark Knight as ecstatically as anybody at the studio. It's worth noting those MPAA figures only reflect the studios' outlay and not that of their partners.</p> <p>Last July a $450m financing structure between Paramount and Deutsche Bank to fund the studio's upcoming slate fell through, partly because Deutsche couldn't convince its partners to pony up the cash so it went back to the studio demanding tougher deal points. Paramount baulked and Deutsche went the way of many institutions in recent years and closed down its film financing arm. Paramount will find a new partner eventually but for now it's set up co-financing deals for its upcoming productions like The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Transformers 2 on a case-by-case basis.</p> <p>Now is as tough a time as any for investment in Hollywood, however while the number of deals will slow down they will continue to trickle in. This week brings two examples of how to appeal to investors. On Monday Relativity Media, which has raised more than $1bn to co-finance hits from Sony and Universal like Hancock, Mamma Mia!, Wanted and Burn After Reading, announced it had received extra investment from its fund partner Elliott Associates. Meanwhile Media Rights Capital (MRC), the low profile film and TV producer behind upcoming releases like Sacha Baron Cohen's Bruno and Ricky Gervais' comedy This Side of the Truth, has just closed a $350m revolving credit facility with a consortium of investors led by JP Morgan Chase.</p> <p>Relativity is a well entrenched co-financing player with a robust track record that speaks for itself. The company is run by former venture capitalist Ryan Kavanaugh and uses debt and private equity to invest in major studio slates as well as single films like 3:10 to Yuma and The Forbidden Kingdom. By and large Relativity, which has also moved into production, scores more hits than misses when you look at a property's life starting with theatrical release and going all the way through to so-called \"free TV\".</p> <p>MRC is run by Asif Satchu and Modi Wiczyk, a pair of entrepreneurs who separately boast high-level experience on Wall Street and in the Hollywood agency world. It's a new studio, basically, backed by Wall Street and private cash that attracts investors by making films with renowned talent while holding on to the property rights with the talent. That's the kicker: MRC brings the Hollywood studios into the equation only when the films are ready and only then as distributors. </p> <p>By holding on to the rights and using the reputation of their collaborators, Satchu and Wiczyk can demand very aggressive terms, as witnessed by the bidding war that engulfed Baron Cohen's Bruno project two years ago. Every studio wanted a piece of Baron Cohen after Borat became a global phenomenon and Universal Pictures eventually acquired the right to distribute Bruno in the US and several other territories for a deal believed to be in the region of $40m. And remember, Universal wasn't involved in the production so its back-end share will be severely limited, leaving MRC and the filmmakers with most of the profits.</p> <p>For institutions and high net worth individuals with jitters about the quality of their investment and the likelihood of a return, MRC's innovative approach could represent one of the best bets in Hollywood. It could also usher in a new era of power player that drains the production talent pool available to the established studios and leaves them feeling more marginalised than they'd like. We'll get a clearer picture when Bruno, This Side of the Truth and several other films backed by MRC open next year.</p>",
  "<p>As the economic crisis deepens, the worsening state of the environment is predictably losing prominence in politics, the media and public debate. It always happens: when times are good, green is good. When times get tough, out goes the green stuff.</p> <p>This time, however, it is different. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/23/climatechange.carboncapturestorage\">science has moved on</a>. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climatechange\">Climate change</a> is no longer a matter of speculation and no longer can it be seen as a long-term concern to be ignored while we deal with more pressing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/globaleconomy\">economic shocks</a>: although that is what could easily happen. <br> But, instead of making the usual predictable trade-offs, a new approach could be taken \u2013 one that joins up the need to cope with the impacts of peak oil and climate change, as well as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/22/oil.climatechange\">kickstarting the economy</a>. A unique opportunity has presented itself, to tame and control the financial system in order to put it at the service of our society; to set us on a more sustainable, secure and fairer trajectory.<br> This is not so much a technical policymaking challenge but a test of our political leaders' willingness to confront the ideological consensus of deregulated finance and small government that they have become used to defending and promoting at every turn.  In the present crisis, however, there is a huge <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/19/creditcrunch.marketturmoil\">opportunity to do things differently</a>, through governments taking control of the economy and by spending money \u2013 large amounts of it \u2013 to stimulate economic activity, cut our reliance on imported fossil fuels and slash climate-changing emissions. By spending now to build a low-carbon economy, we could generate a new army of highly skilled green-collar workers, building new power infrastructure, transport networks and super efficient buildings. <br> This new \"carbon army\" could help reverse the job losses taking place across the economy, including in the financial sector, through massive public investment and incentives aimed at stimulating the emergence of a new zero-carbon and zero-waste future. Hundreds of thousands of jobs could come with this transition, as has become evident in Germany, where leadership from the state has brought about rapid changes in the renewable energy sector. We have to make this change in any event: and if not now, then when?  Leaving the decarbonisation of the economy until after we have shored-up the old financial order won't work. Why should we expect the monster to behave differently once resuscitated? And, in any event, we don't have time to wait and see. We are already either at, or very close to, critical climatic tipping points. Continuing to load the atmosphere with carbon dioxide might give temporary relief for the old system, but it have the kind of climactic impact that will make the present crisis look like a minor inconvenience. We are set on a course toward disaster, and we need to change tack \u2013 fast. It is unfortunate, however, that many politicians seem able to only deal with one issue at a time, because right now we need a joined up programme that simultaneously hits at least three priorities at once: promoting economic recovery, avoiding the worst impacts of peak oil and cutting climate-changing emissions. It is not as if everyone now speaks with one voice in favour of the old order. Even some of the UK's largest companies have spoken out today in calling for a more joined-up strategy for tackling climate change while boosting the economy. So let's do it, because this new political project could be one of the most important in history.</p>",
