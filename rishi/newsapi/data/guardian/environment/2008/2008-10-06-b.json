  "<p>Rural communities which protect nature and exploit forests, wetlands and wildlife sustainably will be the best equipped to cope with the droughts and floods that will increasingly hit Africa, Asia and Latin America with climate change, says a new UN-backed report.</p> <p>Nature-based enterprise, says the report from the World Resources Institute in Washington DC, offers the world's 2 billion rural poor key survival tools to weather the extreme changes that are expected. It argues that communities must be given secure rights to access, manage and profit from, the natural resources they depend on daily and calls on governments and development agencies to scale up such approaches.</p> <p>Supported by the UN Development Programme (UNDP), UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Bank, the report, called Roots of resilience, urges immediate action. </p> <p>\"Poverty will never be made history unless we invest in more intelligent management of the world's nature-based assets,\" said Achim Steiner, UNEP under-secretary general and executive director, at the report's launch in Barcelona. \"Mainstreaming [such] models is now a matter of great urgency in a world challenged by climate change, in a world where we are pushing, if not pushing past, the regenerative limits of the planet's life support systems.\" </p> <p>To support its case, the report highlights successful, groundbreaking examples of nature-based livelihoods around the world. In famine-prone Niger, one of the world's five poorest nations, it reports, low-cost farmer-led efforts to regenerate tree stumps has led to a dramatic re-planting of the semi-desert Sahel region, increasing both rural incomes and food supplies.</p> <p>In Bangladesh, where 70 million people depend on floodplains for food and income, communities have achieved similarly spectacular results in reviving polluted and over-exploited wetlands. After the government awarded 110 villages joint control, along with local authorities, to manage sustainably the fisheries on the doorsteps, fish harvests rose by 140% and household incomes by a third.</p> <p>Scaling up such successful enterprise models, according to Roots of resilience, requires governments and donors to engage communities in sustainably managing drylands, wetlands, watersheds, and forests so that they provide a reliable, renewable source of food and income. In the process, the report argues, poor households will also develop the resilience needed to adapt to the impacts of climate change.</p> <p>The report's blueprint for making this happen includes: transferring legal authority over local ecosystems to communities; building community capacity both to manage natural resources and establish successful nature-based enterprises; and helping local nature-based enterprises link into mainstream business markets.</p> <p>\"Local communities clearly have an interest to sustain the ecosystems on which they depend,\" said Manish Bapna, executive vice president of the World Resources Institute, in Barcelona. \"But today, all too often, they face a disabling, not an enabling environment.\"</p>",
  "<p>Nearly a quarter of the world's land mammal species are at risk of extinction, and many others may vanish before they are even known to science, according to an extensive survey of global wildlife. At least 1,141 of the 5,487 known species of mammal are threatened, with 188 listed in the \"critically endangered\" category. One in three marine mammals are also threatened, according to the five-year review.</p> <p>The assessment, conducted by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red list, involved more than 1,700 experts in 130 countries, and confirms the devastating impact of forest clearing, hunting, fisheries, pollution and climate change on the populations and ranges of the world's most studied class of animals. </p> <p>Jan Schipper, director of the global mammals assessment, a partnership between Conservation International and the IUCN, called for countries to be held responsible for the fate of fauna within their borders and an international coalition to save species that cross national boundaries.<br><br>\"We're looking at a 25% decline over the long term, yet for mammals there is no bail-out plan. There is no long-term conservation strategy that is going to prevent species extinction in the future,\" he said. \"As human beings, we should be ensuring that we don't cause other species to go extinct.\" </p> <p>Disturbingly, the figures are likely to be a conservative estimate, because scientists have insufficient data on 836 species to even classify how threatened they are. If these are all at risk, it would mean 36% of the world's mammal species are in danger of becoming extinct.</p> <p>Among the critically endangered species is the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus), with only 84 to 143 adults remaining. </p> <p>Experts believe 29 others may already have become extinct, including the Yangtze river dolphin, and the little earth hutia, a small rodent endemic to islands off Cuba, which has not been seen in nearly 40 years. Two species, the scimitar-horned oryx and P\u00e8re David's deer, are extinct in the wild, and only live on in captivity. Many species, such as the grey wolf and brown bear, have experienced substantial population declines and seen their ranges contract as their habitats have been destroyed. </p> <p>More than half of the world's mammal species for which trends are known are in decline, the report found.</p> <p>\"We are getting far too used to seeing these reports bemoaning the fate of the planet or the decline of animals. I am really concerned that we have become deadened to this sort of depressing information and now simply ignore it, without stopping to think about the implications,\" said Mark Wright, chief scientist at WWF. \"The IUCN report shows that, with our ill-considered management of the Earth and its resources, we are threatening the future of wildlife and nature and denying our children the chance to experience what we have experienced.\"</p> <p>The survey, which is published by the journal Science today, identifies extinction hotspots where vast numbers of species are under threat. </p> <p>Typically, these are regions with a rich diversity of species that all face a similar threat to their environment. Threatened land mammals are concentrated in south and south-east Asia. There, a staggering 79% of monkeys and apes face extinction. Other hotspots include the tropical Andes, the Cameroonian Highlands, the Albertine rift in central Africa and the Western Ghats in India.</p> <p>\"Often, there is habitat loss from deforestation, either for farming or timber, and that leaves the animals living on small patches of land. Then, on top of that, you have hunting, with an enormous number of people who are entirely reliant on natural resources to feed themselves. That has really set up a perfect storm over south-east Asia,\" said Schipper.</p> <p>The greatest threats to marine mammals are being caught in fishing nets or being struck by shipping vessels, although for the Yangtze river dolphin, pollution is a major contributor.</p> <p>Climate change is already having an impact on amphibians and plant life, but it is expected to put increasing pressure on mammals too, either by destroying their environment, such as the Arctic ice sheets that are home to polar bears, or by forcing their prey elsewhere.</p> <p>Among the most threatened mammals are those only recently discovered. Since 1992, 349 new mammal species have been identified, but 51% of these face extinction, compared with 23% of species known before 1992. </p> <p>\"Species may be vanishing even before they are known to science,\" the scientists write in the journal.</p> <p>There is a glimmer of hope among the bleak assessments. At least 5% of the currently threatened species now have stable or rising populations, many of which are the focus of huge conservation efforts. </p> <p>\"The problem we face is that without the political and public will to spend money on species conservation, we are pressed up against the wall,\" said Schipper. \"By making this data public, we're hoping it'll reach the people who make decisions about where money is spent.\"</p>",
  "<p>When your PC starts acting as though it has attention deficit disorder, staring back at you blankly whenever you try to do anything, the natural instinct is to dial IT and demand a new computer. The last thing you want is for the voice at the other end of the phone to start talking you through complicated reboots, or suggest they come upstairs to \"have a look at it\". </p> <p>Although you may usually spend half your day on YouTube, suddenly you have important deadlines to meet. The best solution for all concerned is for the IT person to bring you a new machine. </p> <p>But where will the old one end up? According to Greenpeace and Computer Aid International \u2013 a charity providing refurbished computers to developing countries \u2013 your broken machine may be illegally shipped and dumped somewhere like Ghana, Nigeria or China. </p> <p>Last month Greenpeace released a <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/toxics/posoning-the-poor-electronic-waste-in-ghana-20080805\">report</a> detailing the increasing amounts of Britain's e-waste being found in huge toxic dumps in Ghana. There, impoverished workers burn it to extract precious metals, releasing harmful chemicals into the atmosphere. These deadly toxins are then inhaled by the workers, many of whom are children, while poisonous substances seep into the soil and rivers, from where they are ingested by livestock, whose meat is then eaten.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.weeecare.com/retailer-compliance.htm\">The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment</a> (Weee) directive was put in place in 2007 to force retailers to take back old computers and recycle them properly. This should make things easy for your company \u2013 in theory it should simply return them to its IT supplier and its eco-conscience is clear. Except that this neat little system doesn't appear to be working.</p> <p>Greenpeace's report traces a calamitous chain of poisoning back to IT equipment from British businesses, colleges, councils and even hospitals. It says defunct computers are being shipped to developing countries by companies that claim they are functioning, second-hand goods for resale. </p> <p>The Environment Agency, which is charged with making sure the Weee directive is properly carried out, says it doesn't have the resources to check every container of second-hand IT equipment heading to countries like Ghana. </p> <p>Computer Aid this week called on the government to tighten up the directive and give the Environment Agency the power it needs to properly police this illegal trade. \"The Environment Agency must be provided with the resources to police e-waste, prosecute anyone involved in a supply chain that results in the dumping of e-waste and remove licences from organisations in breach of the Weee legislation,\" says Louise Richards, the charity's chief executive. </p> <p>\"It's imperative that the government clamps down on fraudulent traders posing as legitimate re-use and recycling organisations, who are enticing unwitting UK businesses to use them for disposal of electrical equipment.\"</p> <p>But for the time being, what can you do to make sure your old PC doesn't end up damaging a child in Africa?</p> <p>At a company level, your boss could try asking for guarantees from suppliers that returned goods will not end up on a dump somewhere in the developing world. Or, as in the days before Weee, the company could look for a reputable organisation to deal with its IT waste, such as Computer Aid International, which will only send working computers to developing countries, <a href=\"http://www.recom.org.uk/computers_for_charity/home.htm\">ReCOM</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.computersforcharity.org.uk/\">Computers for Charity</a>, both of which refurbish computers for community groups and charities. </p> <p>And what can you do as a worker? Try putting pressure on your boss to make sure the company is disposing of old equipment properly \u2013 and next time, get IT to fix your computer rather than demanding a replacement every time it takes more than four seconds to start up.</p>",
  "<p>Britain must abandon using almost all <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/fossilfuels\">fossil fuels</a> to produce power in 20 years' time, the government's climate change watchdog will warn today.</p> <p>The independent Climate Change Committee will publish its advice to the government that the <a href=\"http://www.theccc.org.uk/\">UK should set a 2050 target of cutting all greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80%</a> - including the emissions from aviation and transport, which were previously excluded. </p> <p>Because it is unlikely that emissions from aviation and shipping will be cut so dramatically, other sectors, particularly power generation, would have to reduce emissions by much more, with big increases in energy efficiency, wind and tide power, and probably new nuclear generators, Lord Turner of Ecchinswell, the committee chairman, told the Guardian. </p> <p>\"We have to almost totally decarbonise the power sector by 2030, well before 2050,\" he said.</p> <p>The committee will say the far-reaching changes would cost about 1-2% of the value of the economy in 2050, although growth would still be strong. \"Rather than be twice present levels, [gross domestic product] would be 1 or 2% less than that,\" added Turner.</p> <p>In his speech to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labourconference\">Labour party conference</a> last month, Gordon Brown hinted that the government would accept the new target when it responds, possibly within days, although it is not clear if it will accept the full report.</p> <p>Last night Ed Miliband, the new energy and climate secretary, said he welcomed the report. \"We need to act now to avoid dangerous climate change and the action we take must be guided by experts. This is a pressing issue and we'll respond to the recommendations swiftly. The hard work will be for us all to make emission reductions a reality over the coming decades.\"</p> <p>If the report is accepted in full, campaigners said the UK target would be the most ambitious legally binding commitment of any country and would give the UK a strong position in international negotiations about a new global plan.</p> <p>\"It would mean finally the government would accept the advice of scientists,\" said Martyn Williams, climate change campaigner for Friends of the Earth. \"We could say to people in international negotiations: you can do what we're doing, not just what we're saying.\"</p> <p>However, Williams warned that in future the commitment to include aviation and shipping must also be made legally binding. \"If the government [did] not accept a mechanism to make sure they and other governments were held to account, then we'd have to wonder if there was any confidence it would have to be delivered,\" he said.</p> <p>The Climate Change Committee was set up by the climate change bill and was asked to advise government on whether to increase the target of a 60% cut in carbon emissions by 2050.</p> <p>Today's report will say the new target must be \"at least 80%\" and extend it to include other greenhouse gas emissions such as methane and nitrous oxide. International aviation and shipping should not be part of the legally binding interim \"budgets\" that the committee will report on each year but should be a national target, and would \"absolutely end up with an equal level of scrutiny\", said Turner.</p> <p>In the first decade the biggest change would be a big expansion of energy efficiency and in the second decade of renewable energy. Such a \"radical\" change was \"do-able\" but could also require new nuclear power, and carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology for coal-fired power stations and industries like cement and steel, both of which will be seen as controversial by environmental campaigners. \"It's possible to do it while knocking out particular technologies [like nuclear or CCS], it just gets significantly costly and more difficult to do,\" said Turner.</p> <p>Longer term, zero-carbon electricity would also have to be used to power cars and heat homes, says the report. </p> <p>The report will increase pressure to abandon controversial plans for new coal-fired power stations in the UK before CCS is available at that scale. Ministers have previously admitted full-scale CCS might not happen before 2050. Turner said the committee's opinion would be published in a more detailed report in December. </p> <p>The December report will also recommend interim targets up to 2022 and the impact of different industry sectors.</p>",
  "<p>Before being led upstairs to meet Faye Dunaway, I sit in the bar with the British director of her latest film. David Howard kindly runs me through the things I am absolutely not to ask her. Firstly, there must be no mention of Mommie Dearest, the Joan Crawford biopic credited with destroying Dunaway's career. Nor must I ask her about Andrew Lloyd Webber, who bumped her from the Los Angeles production of Sunset Boulevard in 1994; or about her adult son, who may or may not be adopted; or about the cosmetic surgery that she may or may not have undergone. Is that it? \"Yes,\" says Howard. \"I think that's the lot.\" He turns out to be wrong.</p> <p>Faye Dunaway's reputation precedes her. One of the most compelling actors of her generation and a powerful emblem of 1970s American cinema, she came to fame as a cornfed killer in Bonnie and Clyde (1967), played the doomed Evelyn Mulwray in Chinatown (1974), and won an Oscar for her turn as a rapacious TV executive in Network (1976). But her reputation as a performer has gone hand-in-hand with a reputation as a diva. She has been called difficult and temperamental; after working with her on Chinatown, Roman Polanski said she was unhinged. Maybe this reputation is justified, maybe it's not. All I know is that, despite the warnings, I wind up blundering across another of those Questions That Must Not Be Asked - and after that, all hell breaks loose.</p> <p>Matters begin brightly enough. This is Dunaway's first British press interview in nearly 20 years and she comes wafting into the hotel suite, every inch the solicitous southern hostess (she was born in Florida). She is wearing a floating lilac dress, her blonde hair lifted as if by a gentle breeze, Dunaway arranges herself on the couch and then finds it is not to her liking. I am sitting with my back to the window and the light is in her eyes. \"Now I can't see you,\" she says and gets up to close the curtains. </p> <p>Dunaway is in London to talk about her role in Flick, a cheap and cheerful horror movie screening at the Raindance film festival. It features a game performance from Dunaway as a one-armed Memphis cop on the trail of a zombie Teddy boy. Howard explains that, in casting Dunaway, he was taking his lead from Roger Corman, the B-movie producer who made a habit of hiring older Hollywood legends such as Ray Milland to appear in his movies. </p> <p>\"Oh yeah,\" says Dunaway when I mention this. \"I heard that he said that. I think he was going for - not old Hollywood, let's not say that. But maybe a little of the old-style glamour.\"</p> <p>The shoe fits. It seems no accident that Dunaway's two most indelible roles (in Bonnie and Clyde, and Chinatown) came in Depression-era period movies. Even as a young actor, she looked a creature out of time: a burnished throwback to the era of Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, all sharp angles and radioactive glamour. Her contemporaries Jane Fonda, Ellen Burstyn and Julie Christie seemed to belong more to the rough-and-tumble 1970s. But Dunaway (\"as quick and vivid as a flame\", in the words of critic David Thomson) always held herself differently - aloof and apart. She never played the ingenue; even as a young actor, there was something formidable about her. </p> <p>Dunaway frowns. \"I don't know if I was formidable. Maybe some of the later roles veered in that direction. But you can't say Bonnie and Clyde was formidable, or even Chinatown - maybe a little bit. Network was formidable in the sense that I was playing a strong, avant-garde woman.\" She weighs up the adjective, trying to work out whether or not it's a slight. \"Maybe formidable is OK.\"</p> <p>The daughter of an army sergeant, Dunaway spent an itinerant childhood travelling between bases in Texas, Utah and Germany. Six decades on, she claims she still feels like the rootless kid from the wrong side of the tracks, and retains an affinity for Bonnie Parker, that gum-chewing waitress turned superstar bank-robber. \"It's the role that's closest to me,\" she says. \"I was a southern girl and so was Bonnie. We share the frustrations of living in that small, limited environment - dying to get out and move forward in the world. That was part of my makeup as a girl.\"</p> <p>Life was good in the wake of that film's success. Alongside Jack Nicholson, Warren Beatty and Ellen Burstyn, Dunaway became a mainstay of what is now regarded as a classic period in American movies that ran from the late 1960s to the mid-1970s - starting with Bonnie and Clyde and ending with Star Wars. Did it feel that way at the time? No, she says, of course it didn't. </p> <p>\"You only know it in hindsight. Most of those movies were made within the studio system, which was innovative and rare. Now those movies have to fight really hard to be made and get seen, and it's all because of Mr George Lucas and Star Wars. Everything changed, and since then Hollywood has wanted to make blockbusters, which is why we're into these comic-book movies.\" She smiles. \"I don't think my films would even get made today. Certainly not within the studio system.\"</p> <p>Since she won the best actress Oscar in 1976, Dunaway's successes have been more fitful. She was given a Golden Raspberry award, or Razzie, for her wild-eyed Crawford impersonation in 1981's Mommie Dearest. (\"It was meant to be a window into a tortured soul,\" she said at the time. \"But it was made into camp.\") She sued Lloyd Webber after she was dropped from the cast days before Sunset Boulevard was set to open in LA. Added to this were reports about her behaviour: after directing her on the set of Chinatown, Polanski described Dunaway as \"a gigantic pain in the ass\" and said that she \"demonstrated certifiable proof of insanity\". This view seemed to gain traction as the leading-lady roles grew scarcer. </p> <p>Does the whole thing come down to a case of Hollywood sexism, I ask her. After all, nobody ever complained about her former co-stars Jack Nicholson, Steve McQueen or Marlon Brando being a little bit wild or rebellious. </p> <p>But Dunaway doesn't bite: she can't think what I mean. \"Has Jack been rebellious? He does things on his own terms and accepts that things have meaning. Too often we are asked to aim lower. I think that maybe what I have in common with some of the men you've mentioned is that we question things, and think how we can make them better and truer. But I don't ever remember being rebellious.\" </p> <p>Most of the stories, I prompt her, stemmed from the set of Chinatown. Dunaway shoots me a look. \"Oh,\" she says. \"The Roman thing. Well, he's an auteur, and at the time he had his own pressures, and I don't really want to go into it. But you really want there to be collaboration and you really want there to be kindness, and sometimes that was impossible. The pressures of the moment mean that we all lost our patience a little bit - even Jack.\"</p> <p>In his bestselling book Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, Peter Biskind paints a grisly picture of life on the Chinatown set. Dunaway and Nicholson were both accustomed to a looser, more creative way of working, and here they were acting for a European director who regarded himself as the boss and his players as staff. Tempers flared on both sides. Biskind reports that Polanski once forcibly plucked a stray hair from Dunaway's head, because he thought it was catching the light and spoiling his shot. He also claims that Dunaway later took her revenge by throwing a cup of urine in the director's face after she was refused a bathroom break. </p> <p>Is this true, that she once threw a cup of urine over Roman Polanski?</p> <p>It is as if an electric current has gone through her. \"I won't respond to that,\" she blurts. \"That doesn't even deserve the dignity of a response. I don't know the details of that. It is absolutely ridiculous.\"</p> <p>OK, so the story is untrue. \"This from the Guardian?\" she explodes. \"I don't believe it! It is insulting that you would even bring it up!\" Abruptly, the outrage seems to lift her from her seat. \"I can't go on with this,\" she announces to the far wall. \"I think you've brought up something that is so distasteful.\" She can barely get the words out. \"You know very well,\" she says. \"I am a lady and you were completely insulting.\"</p> <p>It dawns on me that I am being thrown out. I am not sure this has ever happened before, and it is a peculiarly horrible feeling. By now Dunaway is at the far side of the room. She says she is going to ring down to the film-makers. She is incandescent with rage. </p> <p>\"Look,\" I say. \"I'm very sorry. I didn't intend to insult you.\"</p> <p>She rounds on me with the phone in one hand. \"Yes, you did! Yes, you did! You don't speak of that unless you had an intention.\" We stare at each other for a second. \"My God,\" she says, as though clobbered by a fresh revelation. \"I turned down the Mail to do this!\"</p> <p>Outside, the sky is clouding over. I run into Flick's director and producer. We are all a little shaken, ashen-faced. We stare at the ground. \"OK,\" I tell them. \"Turns out I couldn't ask about Polanski either.\"</p> <p>\u2022 The <a href=\"http://www.raindance.co.uk/site/index.php?aid=2388\">16th Raindance film festival</a> is on now until Sunday</p>",
  "<p>A food crisis is highly likely in the UK, with price and availability becoming issues that swing the outcome of future elections, according to a report from the thinktank Chatham House.</p> <p>The UK's food system is unable to cope with rapid changes in supply driven by climate change, rising energy prices and population growth, the report says. Consumers are likely to have to accept a shift from individual preferences to a system in which government and industry have to ensure the food that is sold reflects the wider needs of society. The report, made available in draft to the Guardian, will be published next month. Hilary Benn, the environment, food and rural affairs secretary, used the first day of a Chatham House conference yesterday on the future of food to announce the creation of a food policy council to advise government on costs and security of supply.</p> <p>In what appeared to be a shift in policy, he said: \"With rising prices and increasing demand across the globe, we can't take our food supply for granted. </p> <p>\"Our supply needs to be reliable and resilient and able to withstand shocks and crises.\" </p> <p>In an indication of the government's concern about the effect of food price rises, Benn was asked to update Gordon Brown's national economic council on the UK's food supply yesterday. </p> <p>The Chatham House study concludes that the British government does not yet fully understand the challenges it faces over food in the 10 years. It identifies serious challenges to world agriculture:</p> <p>\u2022 UK consumers use food at a rate that represents six times more land and sea than is available to them. </p> <p>\u2022 Developed countries face a chronic shortage of migrant workers, leading to the loss of seasonal crops. In Scotland up to a fifth of the soft fruit crop, worth \u00a35.2m, could be lost in 2008. </p> <p>\u2022 The equivalent of 20 Nile rivers move annually from developing to developed countries, but much of agriculture's use of water is unsustainable. </p> <p>\u2022 Modern food production is energy-intensive and vulnerable to oil and gas price rises. </p> <p>\u2022 Rising prices of agricultural commodities have already produced pressure for more protectionism. Russia plans to form a state grain trading company to control up to half of its cereal exports. </p> <p>\u2022 Falling yields due to climate change will inflate food prices further. </p> <p>\u2022 The rapid rise in world population will continue to push up demand. </p> <p>\u2022 Emerging economies such as China and India are shifting to more meat and dairy products. This will cause greater pressure on food and feed prices, and exacerbate environmental and health problems. </p> <p>\"Other countries have already started looking at food in strategic terms. It's about time the UK did the same,\" said Kate Bailey, who led the research for the project.</p>",
  "<p>Sunday's Great North Run provided its usual stunning spectacle of perspiration and inspiration - Jo Pavey showed plenty of that in finishing third - with a certain air of predictability which even included the early autumn sunshine. The biggest victory, however, probably took place away from the finish line when the organisers announced over the weekend that the current sponsor, Bupa, has committed to the event through to 2013. </p> <p>In the current financial climate it will undoubtedly become increasingly difficult to persuade sports' commercial partners, be they global companies or local car dealers, to part with investment which they may consider could be better used elsewhere. </p> <p>The long-term impact on sport may be difficult to predict while only the fiscally naive would not be bracing themselves for bad news some way down the road. For some of our Olympic sports that bad news could well be coming sooner than expected despite the success of Team GB in Beijing this summer </p> <p>As has been reported recently the funding package for the next four years leading in to 2012 is looking less likely to contain the significant contribution from the private sector that the government had hoped for and UK Sport could be left with some difficult decisions in the coming weeks.</p> <p>Back in 2005 things looked very different. After winning the bid to stage the 2012 Games the goal was set to lift the British team to fourth in the medal table from its Athens position of 10th. </p> <p>The government agreed to match the \u00a3300m - expected from lottery sales in the period leading up to London - by contributing \u00a3200m from Treasury funds with a further \u00a3100m coming from the many corporate partners who were expected to be queuing up to get involved. </p> <p>That commitment allowed UK Sport and the governing bodies to plan more effectively than before and significantly fund sports with little or no previous medal pedigree. </p> <p>In Beijing the impact was clear to see with results exceeding all expectations and highlighting the progress that has been made due to the programmes that have been in place for almost a decade and are fast becoming the envy of many other countries.</p> <p>The present challenge is that the contribution expected from the private sector has reached a significant proportion of the total spend required to maintain those programmes at current level. Hence the request last week for government to step in. </p> <p>Lottery sales have apparently improved and the Department for Culture Media and Sport last week suggested that a further \u00a320m could be forthcoming. But that still leaves a \u00a360m hole at best, which needs to be filled by someone. Otherwise there will have to be cuts and they are not likely to be made by top slicing. It will be total programmes that will go and no one really knows exactly how many or indeed which sports will be involved. </p> <p>As long ago as March the National Audit Office highlighted the potential problem being stored up even without the changes seen in the economic climate since then and it will perhaps be the first to ask the question as to whether or not more government money should be directed at elite sport, particularly at the lower end of the success league table. </p> <p>Many would argue that the return of investment has so far been immense for the nation and, although nothing can be guaranteed in terms of medals in 2012, some semblance of continuity is essential. </p> <p>The Olympic and Paralympic sports were all expecting that their next four-year funding agreement with UK Sport would be in place by the end of the year. Not knowing if the total budget is in place will force the funding agencies to work to a worst-case scenario. </p> <p>These are difficult times for all and the government obviously has greater pressure elsewhere but our performances in 2012 will be a matter of national pride. The corporate sector could eventually prove willing to contribute but, with no guarantee currently in place, the World Class Programmes overall will be left significantly weakened. </p> <p>The government does have the option to underwrite the hoped for income but as yet appears reluctant to take such a step, however desirable it may appear.The next few weeks will be crucial to all concerned and, while the sports that did best in Beijing, such as cycling, rowing, sailing and swimming, are likely to be given the green light to plan ahead as normal, there will be a nervous wait for others.</p>",
  "<p>While all eyes were fixed on the banking bail-out, a bucketload of public money was quietly sloshed into the pockets of another undeserving cause. Last week, George Bush agreed to lend $25bn to US car manufacturers. It's a soft loan, which will cost the government $7.5bn. Few people noticed; fewer fought it. The House of Representatives approved the measure by 370 votes to 58. The great corporate bail-out is spreading like the plague.</p> <p>It has already crossed the Atlantic. Yesterday European car makers demanded that the EU hand them \u20ac40bn ($54bn) in cheap loans to match the US subsidy. Where will the public spending spree end?</p> <p>The motor companies in both Europe and the US claim they need these loans to help them go green. They will invest the money in a new generation of environmental technologies, which will allow them to meet the efficiency standards their governments are setting. There is more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents ... but how strange this green enthusiasm seems, now that there's the smell of public money in the air. For the past 10 years the car manufacturers have driven every useful green initiative into the wall.</p> <p>In 1998 European car makers promised to show that they could cut their greenhouse gases voluntarily. By the end of 2008, they pledged, they would reduce the average emissions produced by their cars from 190 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometre to 140. How well have they done? By the end of last year they had cut average pollution to 158g/km across Europe and 165g/km in the UK: they will miss their target by some 40%.</p> <p>Discerning, only 10 years too late, that lobby groups' promises are worth as much as a share in Lehman Brothers, in 2006 the European commission announced that it would set compulsory standards: by 2012 all manufacturers would have to reduce their average CO2 emissions to 120g/km. It looked like progress, until you remembered that 120g was the target proposed by the EU in 1994, to be met by 2005. It was repeatedly delayed by industry lobbying.</p> <p>Last year the 2012 target fell to the same forces. Angela Merkel, lobbying on behalf of companies such as DaimlerChrysler and BMW, demanded that the European commission put the brakes on. (Ironically it was Merkel, as the idealistic young German environment minister, who had first proposed the target of 120g/km by 2005.) The commission agreed to revise the figure to 130g, and to cover the gap by raising the contribution from biofuels. Since then we've seen hard evidence that most biofuels, as well as spreading starvation, produce more greenhouse gases than petrol; but the policy remains unchanged.</p> <p>Now the pollutocrats are whingeing that they can't meet the 130g target either. A month ago they persuaded the European parliament's industry committee to take up their case: it proposed postponing the target until 2015, reducing the fines if they don't comply, and allowing manufacturers to offset eco-innovations against the target even if these don't actually reduce emissions. These invertebrates, in other words, proposed to grant official approval to industry greenwash. Fortunately this scam was rejected two weeks ago by the parliament's environment committee.</p> <p>In the US, manufacturers have still not reached the standard (an average of 27.5 miles per gallon) that they were supposed to have met, under the Energy Policy Conservation Act, by 1985. The average car sold in the States today is less efficient than the 1908 Model T Ford.</p> <p>What makes this dithering so frustrating is that to be talking, in 2008, about targets of 130 or 120g/km is a bit like discussing whether modern computers should have 10 rows of sliding beads or 100. In 1974 a stripped-down 1959 Opel T-1 managed 377 miles to the US gallon (160km/l), which equates to 15 grams of CO2 per kilometre. There is no technical reason why the maximum limit for mass-produced cars shouldn't be 50g/km.</p> <p>Nor is there a good commercial reason. A poll by the Newspaper Marketing Agency shows that 80% of car buyers say economy is now more important to them than performance. The car industry's technological failure results entirely from lobbying by the companies now demanding public money to go green. They want to squeeze every last drop from existing technologies before switching to better models.</p> <p>Their sabotage of green technology has been both subtle and comprehensive. The film Who Killed The Electric Car? shows how the manufacturers, working with oil companies and corrupt officials, sank California's attempt to change vehicle technologies. Having bumped off battery power, they persuaded the federal government to pour money instead into hydrogen vehicles, aware that the technological hurdles are so high that a cheap, mass-produced model might never be possible. Electric cars, by contrast, have been ready for the mass market for almost a century. The $1.2bn that the US government is spending on research and development for hydrogen cars - like the \u20ac2bn pledged to the same quest by the European Union - is a subsidy for avoiding technological change.</p> <p>Now, after so much procrastination, the car makers have the flaming cheek to demand public money to pursue the policies they have spent 50 years and millions of dollars crushing. Of course, the \"green loans\" they are soliciting are nothing of the kind. Funding better environmental performance is simply an excuse for bailing out another failing industry. As a result of the credit crunch and high oil prices, new car registrations in the UK fell by 21% last month. In the US, sales by the major manufacturers have declined this year by between 20 and 35%.</p> <p>There is no need to spend a penny of public money on greening the motor industry. As a recent report by the House of Commons environmental audit committee shows, you could achieve the same outcome by creating a bigger differential between vehicle tax bands: it proposes that people buying the least efficient cars should pay around \u00a32,000 more per year than those buying the most efficient. This would kill the market for gas guzzlers and force the industry to make the changes it has long resisted.</p> <p>But the government has taken all the flak a good tax policy would have generated for very little gain. Its controversial new vehicle tax banding will save a mere 0.16 million tonnes of CO2 per year: a drop in the acidifying ocean. At scarcely greater political cost it could have hammered emissions and generated much of the money it needs to revolutionise public transport. Again there has been a great historical slide: between 1920 and 1948 cars were taxed at \u00a31 per horsepower: in real terms (and in some cases in nominal terms) a far higher rate for gas guzzlers than today's.</p> <p>But subsidies are what governments pay when regulation doesn't happen. If you don't have the guts to force companies to do something, you must bribe them instead. It's a fair guess that European car makers will still fail to meet their environmental targets, even if they get the money they're demanding. The greenest thing governments could do is to allow these foot-dragging, planet-eating spongers to go under.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com\">monbiot.com</a></p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-338353483\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p> It was a showdown to cherish for critics of Wall Street's culture of enrichment. The grim-faced boss of the bankrupt bank <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/lehmanbrothers\">Lehman Brothers</a> was left squirming yesterday as a veteran Democrat roasted him over his multimillion-dollar pay. </p> <p>With the startled look of a man unaccustomed to sharp examination, Lehman chief executive Richard Fuld clashed bluntly with the chairman of the House oversight committee, Henry Waxman, on Capitol Hill. </p> <p>Called on to explain why Lehman collapsed last month, Fuld began with a note of humility, saying he felt \"horrible\" over the demise of the 158-year-old institution. \"I want to be very clear,\" Fuld said. \"I take full responsibility for the decisions I made and for the actions I took.\" </p> <p>In a brief speech which was heard in silence, Fuld told legislators that if he could turn back the clock he would do many things differently. As soon as he finished speaking, sparks began to fly. </p> <p>The chairman of the committee held up a chart suggesting that Fuld's personal remuneration totalled $480m (\u00a3276m) over eight years, including payouts of $91m in 2001 and $89m in 2005. </p> <p>\"Your company is now bankrupt and our country is in a state of crisis,\" said Waxman, a liberal from California. \"You get to keep $480m. I have a very basic question: Is that fair?\" </p> <p>After a long pause, Fuld said the figure was exaggerated: \"The majority of my compensation, sir, came in stock. The vast majority of the stock I got I still owned at the point of our [bankruptcy] filing.\" </p> <p>Waxman cut him off, saying that even if the figure was slightly lower, it was \"unimaginable\" to much of the public. \"Is that fair, for a CEO of a company that's now bankrupt, to make that kind of money? It's just unimaginable to so many people.\" </p> <p>\"I would say to you the $500m number is not accurate,\" said Fuld. \"I'd say to you, although it's still a large number, for the years you're talking about here, my cash compensation was close to $60m, which you've indicated here, and I took out closer to $250m [in shares].\" </p> <p>Interrupting again, Waxman listed Fuld's collection of property, including a $14m ocean-front villa in Florida and a home in an exclusive ski resort. </p> <p>\"You and your wife have an art collection filled with million dollar paintings,\" Waxman said. \"Your former president, Joe Gregory, used to travel to work in a helicopter.\" </p> <p>A pugnacious congressman with a bald head and military moustache, Waxman warmed to his theme: \"You made all this money taking risks with other people's money.\" </p> <p>Refusing to give ground, Fuld said his pay had been set by an independent compensation committee which spent \"a tremendous amount of time\" making sure executives' interests were aligned with those of shareholders. </p> <p>\"When the company did well, we did well,\" Fuld said. \"When the company did not do well, we didn't do well.\" </p> <p>Waxman disagreed: \"Mr Fuld, there seems to be a breakdown, because you did very well when the company was doing well and you did well when the company was not doing well. And now your shareholders who owned your company have nothing. They've been wiped out.\" </p> <p>Fuld's evidence was his first public appearance since Lehman failed, sparking a chain of events which has sent shockwaves through the global financial system and prompted the US government to begin a $700bn bail-out of the banking sector. </p> <p>A lifelong Lehman employee who joined the firm as an intern in 1966, Fuld has been blamed for the debacle by many of the bank's 28,000 staff - including those in London who have accused senior management of filleting Lehman's British operation of money in the bank's final days. </p> <p>Deadpan and emotionless, Fuld repeatedly frustrated congressmen by answering questions with lengthy, technical financial explanations. </p> <p>Frustrated by his demeanour, a Republican congressman, John Mica, tried humour: \"If you haven't discovered your role, you're the villain today. You've got to act like a villain.\" </p> <p>Fuld stared back wordlessly, without a shadow of a smile.</p>",
  "<p>The FTSE 100's record points fall yesterday, part of a global stockmarket rout, reflected growing fear that the world economy is heading into a deep recession and that national authorities are losing their grip on the situation.</p> <p>In London there were growing calls from business for the Bank of England to get \"ahead of the curve\" by slashing interest rates by a half a percentage point on Thursday. Threadneedle Street has refused to budge for the past six months because of worries about inflation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338346600\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2008/08/13/bank14084.jpg\" alt=\"Bank of England building, Threadneedle Street\" width=\"140\" height=\"84\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Poll: How much should the Bank cut interest rates?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Economists pointed to unusual comments by the chancellor, Alistair Darling, on Sunday, that the Bank, led by Governor Mervyn King, had scope to cut rates - a clear sign that he is frustrated by the Bank's lack of action on monetary policy.</p> <p>But Darling also disappointed the markets yesterday by failing to announce rumoured plans to put in large sums of public money to recapitalise UK banks.</p> <p>The FTSE suffered another lurch lower as Darling told the Commons only that the government would do \"whatever is necessary\" to maintain stability. He announced that all options remained open and hinted that the \u00a350,000 ceiling on protection for bank deposits, which comes into force today, could be raised.</p> <p>But that did not reassure the stockmarket. Although there was continued uncertainty about the extent of protection offered to banks by the German government, investors felt that the British government was dragging its feet on extending blanket protection to all bank deposits as Ireland and Greece have done.</p> <p>Having been stung by criticism of their slow handling of the Northern Rock collapse, the Treasury, Bank of England and Financial Services Authority drew up contingency plans for another bank failing. </p> <p>When they put together a rescue for Bradford &amp; Bingley three weeks ago, there was a feeling within the Treasury that it was back on the front foot, having devised the package in the space of a weekend. But Treasury officials were angered last week when Ireland gave a blanket guarantee for all bank deposits, potentially destabilising UK banks if depositors fled to banks such as Allied Irish. It again made the British authorities look off the pace.</p> <p>And yesterday's words from Darling did not quell growing concern that the authorities appear to be chasing rather than leading the game, although there was little sign either that other governments were able to get ahead of such a rapidly evolving situation.</p> <p>While new research showed that the Bank had massively stepped up efforts in recent weeks to flood interbank money markets with liquidity to prevent the banking system from seizing up, Threadneedle Street was urged to do more. </p> <p>Both the British Chambers of Commerce and the CBI urged the Bank's monetary policy committee (MPC) to cut interest rates by half a percentage point on Thursday. The Bank has left rates steady at 5% for the past six months as King and other MPC members worried about inflation rising further and further above target.</p> <p>But with oil and commodity prices falling even further yesterday on fears of a global economic recession, economists said the Bank should focus more on preventing a slide into a protracted recession.</p> <p>John Cridland, CBI deputy director general, said: \"In our recent economic forecast, we believed that the MPC would have scope to cut rates by half a point in November, but in the interests of stabilising confidence for markets, businesses and consumers, the CBI now believes that this move should be brought forward to the October meeting.\"</p> <p>A big majority of City economists now expects a rate cut this week, which they view as one of the Bank's last weapons to get a grip on the credit crunch and its increasing impact on the real economy. But even that will not prevent a recession, which some economists said yesterday could even lead to the Bank cutting rates as far as 2.5%. On Friday the Bank relaxed its collateral requirements in money markets and committed more funds in its latest bid to prevent markets seizing.</p> <p>Research yesterday from the Swiss bank Credit Suisse showed that the Bank support to jammed up money markets had risen to about \u00a3114bn in recent weeks, up from \u00a340-50bn in the previous year.</p> <p>The Bank has announced it will add another \u00a340bn in liquidity at an auction today. But the daily fixings by the British Bankers' Association yesterday showed that interbank rates had not eased in spite of the US Congress finally approving its $700bn (\u00a3388bn) bail-out last Friday.</p> <p>The Federal Reserve, the US central bank, announced a fresh round of money market interventions, including offering interest on reserves that commercial banks lodge with it and raising the amounts of funding available at its regular auctions. But US stocks tumbled as rapidly as those in Britain, with economists dismayed that the Fed had not made an emergency cut in interest rates.</p>",
  "<p>The energy industry regulator, Ofgem, said yesterday that its seven-month investigation into Britain's energy market had found no evidence of price-fixing by the big six suppliers, but it warned that millions of consumers were missing out on the benefits of competition.</p> <p>The regulator said 4 million consumers were unable to take advantage of the best offers, leaving them an average of \u00a355 a year worse off. Customers who used pre-payment meters often paid a premium that could not be justified by the actual costs of the service. Those paying quarterly by cash or cheque were charged an average of \u00a380 more than those who used direct debit - double the level of 2005.</p> <p>In its report, Ofgem expressed concern that many of the most vulnerable customers, including the elderly and those on low incomes, were less likely to be able to make informed choices about tariffs. The regulator said it was proposing wide-ranging reforms, which would be subject to a fast-track consultation process, including a requirement for companies to provide information to help consumers get the best deal.</p> <p>Ofgem will also look at the wholesale electricity market to make it easier for new entrants to challenge the incumbents: British Gas, Scottish and Southern Energy, EDF Energy, Scottish Power, E.ON and npower.</p> <p>Alistair Buchanan, Ofgem's chief executive, said: \"These are hard times and we are taking a hard line on behalf of disadvantaged customers. We accept global influences are pushing up costs but the suppliers must change their behaviour. If they fail to satisfy our requirements voluntarily then we can move to a Competition Commission reference.\" However, he added: \"We have found no evidence of a cartel.\"</p> <p>Ofgem set up the inquiry in February in the wake of a round of price increases from the big six suppliers. Prices have since gone up again, with the companies blaming soaring prices in the wholesale gas and electricity markets.</p> <p>Yesterday's report was given a mixed reception. The chief executive of the National Housing Federation, David Orr, said: \"The announcement ... by Ofgem that it is going to consult over the introduction of a voluntary scheme to end the pre-payment meter rip-off is deeply disappointing, as it means that the plight of some of the poorest in society will drag on.</p> <p>\"This was Ofgem's big chance to show it was a regulator with teeth but it has fluffed it. Asking fat-cat energy companies to do the right thing by the fuel poor is like asking Dracula to look after a blood bank.\"</p>",
  "<p>The price of oil, metals and food were all tumbling last night amid fears that the global crisis will trigger a drop in demand.</p> <p>The slump in North Sea crude to $84 a barrel - its lowest level in 12 months - should mean relief for car owners although motoring organisations have long complained that oil companies are slow to cut pump prices when crude values fall.</p> <p>Members of the oil producers' cartel Opec were immediately in discussions about reducing output to correct what it called oversupply.</p> <p>The benchmark US light crude for November delivery was down by more than $4 to $88 in its fourth consecutive day of losses. This comes after the near 40% fall in oil prices since they hit $147 in July, and North Sea Brent crude was also down by $6 to $84 a barrel. </p> <p>Edward Meir, of the broker MF Global, said: \"The prevailing macro sentiment is now crystallising around the notion that we are heading into a synchronised global slowdown, a mirror image of the across-the-board expansion we saw from 2004 to early 2007.\"</p> <p>Oil demand in the United States, the world's top energy consumer, has dived this year under the weight of record prices, while consumption in Japan and Europe has also weakened. </p> <p>There are now worries about whether China, where rapid economic growth helped trigger oil's rise from $20 a barrel in 2002, can keep delivering consistent growth. </p> <p>Coffee, sugar and grain prices were down sharply, while copper fell by almost 8% to a 20-month low although gold, a traditional safe haven in turbulent times, was firmer, recouping losses caused mainly by the strong dollar.</p>",
  "<p>It would be hard to conceive of a worse time to be plugging careers in finance to schoolkids and students. For a start, there is the obvious job security aspect, as every day seems to bring news of the collapse of a bank hitherto assumed to be unassailable. And now there is an image problem, too. The tabloids are gleefully ranting about \"spivs\", and they have caught something of the public mood.</p> <p>So, might it not, in the circumstances, be wiser to postpone next week's launch of Directions, a new service aimed at careers advisers and teachers, and by extension young people seeking guidance on working in finance? </p> <p>\"Would anyone still consider a career in financial services?\" repeats Teresa Sayers, in response to my question. \"I'm saying, 'Absolutely yes, they would.'\" </p> <p>Sayers is chief executive of the Financial Services Skills Council (FSSC), which covers about 2 million people working in financial services and accountancy. Leaving aside any hesitations that the current global crisis might cause young people thinking about careers, surely recruitment is the last thing on the City executives' minds. </p> <p>\"The immediate issue for some firms undoubtedly is their survival, but for others that fortunately find themselves in a more stable situation this is about competitiveness and finding the right people in place to continue to grow,\" Sayers says.</p> <p>There is a clear determination in the sector skills council to remain upbeat despite the hideous mess that has emerged. The most obvious proof of this is the absence of any mention of the near economic catastrophe on its website.</p> <p>One of the skills council's roles, listed on the site's \"What we do\" page, is to \"provide unrivalled analysis and intelligence about the sector, communicated in a straightforward, jargon-free style\". But on the \"latest news\" page there is not a whisper of the sky falling in on Wall Street or the City of London.</p> <p>\"It's true to say that if you look at our website there's no coverage about the current economic turmoil,\" Sayers says. \"However, as an organisation very much engaged with the industry, this is a matter that's very high on the agenda. We're still in the midst of this turmoil and we need to come out of it and see the impact. I don't think anyone will understand for some time the overall impact that it will have.\"</p> <p>So, for instance, the skills council has no intelligence on the numbers of jobs that have been lost or could yet be lost. \"We don't have those figures,\" she says. \"I'm not sure that anyone has those figures.\" Some organisations, such as Lloyds TSB, have complained that numbers quoted in the media about job losses have been inaccurate, she points out.</p> <p>Wait and see is the order of the day. Meanwhile, energy is focused on the task that the FSSC was given by the government - \"to work in partnership with employers to provide strategic and responsible leadership for training, education and development for the industry\" and thus help to keep the UK as the leading international financial services centre.</p> <p>\"Certainly we've been talking to employers around a range of issues,\" says Sayers. \"The conversations are around skills, their needs today and in the future.\" These are, for the most part, familiar and predictable. For instance, where can they get good recruits who will, if hired, contribute to their business as quickly as possible?</p> <p>Directions, to be launched in 10 days' time, is firstly aimed at furnishing teachers, and others who give advice and guidance, with \"robust and generic\" information about job opportunities in the financial sector. </p> <p><strong>Untapped talent</strong></p> <p>There has long been a concern that a large proportion of youth remains untapped talent so far as financial services are concerned. And, like other sectors, it is facing the imminent demographic changes that mean that the supply of available young people will get even smaller.</p> <p>\"Research has shown us that if a young person doesn't have anyone within their immediate circle who can provide a role model or share experience about the financial sector, to a large extent it is an area they wouldn't even consider,\" Sayers says.</p> <p>Some parts of the industry struggle to raise their profile among school and college leavers. She cites the London insurance market: \"Arguably it doesn't attract the highest calibre of people.\"</p> <p>And yet the global market offers UK financial services, and by extension the nation's youth, great opportunities \"because we have the talent, skills, innovation and experience\".</p> <p>But some would say that innovation has been the problem. Isn't it innovation, rather than sticking to boring old deposits and loans, that, for instance, has got banks into trouble?</p> <p>\"Let's remind ourselves that this is a global market,\" Sayers says. \"This is not the result of one factor in isolation. Yes, we have a very sophisticated financial services market with very sophisticated products. That's clearly what's needed. We have to make sure that we have people with the right skills and with innovation to make sure that the UK continues to lead the world.\"</p>",
  "<h2>Creativity is the answer to all our problems</h2> <p>The title of Professor Les Ebdon's article promises more than it delivers (Creative thinking key to economic future, September 30). The increasing importance of the creative industries is beyond doubt, but we should recognise that all industries are, to a greater or lesser extent, creative and that creativity is the key, not only to economic development, but also to solving the social, economic and environmental problems facing us. </p> <p>In schools, colleges and universities we are right to stress the importance of skills, but skills alone are not the answer. It seems reasonable to suggest that the industrial revolution had little to do with skills and a great deal to do with people finding solutions to problems using creativity, imagination and innovation. </p> <p>In all sectors of education we should encourage the use of a wide range of teaching and learning methods - particularly problem-based learning and thinking skills, even the much-derided \"discovery learning\" - which encourage creativity, risk-taking and excitement; qualities which, unfortunately, cannot easily be measured or assessed. <br><strong>Peter Scales</strong> <br>Senior lecturer in education, University of Derby </p> <h2>Who does he think we are?</h2> <p>Quite who or what the Lord Patten of Barnes thinks the British middle classes are is hard to gauge.

My wife and I are college lecturers with four children. Our eldest is about to go up to Keble College, Oxford, and we've created a financial package for him that we can barely afford. His sibs we also hope to assist as best we can when their university days are upon them. Presumably we are not paid-up members of Lord Patten's middle class, for in common with most of our friends and colleagues we couldn't afford to put our children through private schooling; nor did we want to.</p> <p>Chris Patten's 1992 \"Labour's Double Whammy\" spelt out on a pair of huge red boxing gloves the following cause and effect: \"1. More Taxes. 2. Higher Prices\". His self-directed 2008 double whammy would be: \"1. Higher university costs for parents. 2. Huge drop in university applicants\".

  "<p>Tina Brown, one of the most distinguished magazine editors of her generation who blazed a trail through the media capitals of London and New York, yesterday embarked on her latest venture: to test her legendary skills in the printed medium in the anarchic environment of cyberspace.</p> <p>Brown unveiled her new offering, the Daily Beast, with a launch devoid of fanfare. The website is her first venture into internet publishing and will be followed closely by media watchers curious to see how the former editor of Vanity Fair and the New Yorker will fare.</p> <p>The site has a clean and elegant design that is Brown's hallmark, aided by the fact that it is as yet uncluttered by online advertising. It is positioned somewhere in the middle of news websites Drudge and the Huffington Post, both in terms of content and politics.</p> <p>It has more original content than Drudge though less than the Post. But like Drudge it also acts as an aggregator, linking to stories of the day as chosen by its small team of editors under its motto \"Read this, skip that\".</p> <p>Politically, it seeks a non-partisan tone, in contrast to the spiky, rightist edge of Drudge and the unashamed liberalism of the Post. Its contributors span the spectrum, from the architect of the conservative revolution, Newt Gingrich, to Bill Clinton who makes an appearance on launch day with his selection of books on the financial crisis.</p> <p>Brown has much riding on the fate of the Daily Beast. Financially, it will have a fraction of the running costs of her last big foray into publishing, Talk magazine - and those will be born by media executive Barry Diller's group InterActiveCorp, of which the website forms a part. But the collapse of Talk in 2002 dented her reputation as an editor with the golden touch, and this may be her chance to regain it.</p> <p>Sree Sreenivasan, professor of new media at Columbia Journalism School, believes her chances of success are good. \"People are finding it hard to keep up amid the explosion of news and information and they're looking for ways to cut through the clutter like this.\"</p> <p>The name of the site is drawn from Brown's favourite novel, Evelyn Waugh's Scoop, about the excesses of Fleet Street newspapers; a curious allusion for a start-up with no formal links to the old print medium.</p> <p>But then she is self-deprecating about her own lack of knowledge about the web, confessing on the site that she is a \"real dinosaur\" who was born in an era when the smallest computer was the size of a subway car. But then she also protests: \"I'm not completely sure how a printing press works, but that never stopped me.\"</p> <p>She is also seeking to meet head-on suggestions that her site is a pale imitation of Arianna Huffington's hugely successful site, denying that she is jealous of her rival and calling her a \"very old friend\".</p> <p>Huffington repaid the compliment, saying: \"I'm very glad to see her diving into the internet. The more sites there are offering smart, compelling content, the more people will get their news, opinion and entertainment online and that's good for all of us.\"</p>",
  "<p>The market research firm Taylor Nelson Sofres (TNS) finally surrendered to Sir Martin Sorrell's WPP yesterday, recommending the group's \u00a31.1bn takeover offer to shareholders.</p> <p>TNS dropped its opposition after more than 60% of shareholders said they would accept WPP's cash-and-shares offer. But the company, which had consistently rejected WPP's advances over the past six months, said it had changed its stance because investors who did not sell were in danger of being left with shares in an unlisted company.</p> <p>WPP has said that it will make its offer unconditional once it has received acceptances from 75% of shareholders, at which point it can delist TNS's shares.</p> <p>\"The board, which has been so advised by Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan Cazenove and Moelis &amp; Company, now recommends that shareholders accept the WPP offer, as the directors intend to do in respect of their own beneficial holdings,\" TNS said in a statement. </p> <p>The WPP offer closes on Wednesday afternoon, but 61% of shareholders have already indicated that they are in favour of the deal, which will hand them 173p in cash and 0.1889 of a new WPP share for every TNS share.</p> <p>It is believed that the plunging value of the London stockmarket also played a part in ending TNS's resistance.</p> <p>Combining TNS with WPP's research operations will create the second-largest market research business in the world, after Nielsen.

  "<p>Labour MPs rallied behind Gordon Brown last night amid signs that his government reshuffle and the financial crisis have taken the sting out of the challenge to his leadership that emerged last month.</p> <p>George Howarth, one of the MPs agitating for a leadership challenge, last night called off the fight, telling the prime minister and a packed meeting of Labour MPs that the \"hostilities are over\".</p> <p>Howarth said Brown's speech to the parliamentary Labour party was the best speech to a party meeting he had ever heard. </p> <p>\"Things have moved on and it's appropriate that the party unifies in the face of the present financial situation,\" Howarth said. </p> <p>\"I'm now confident the prime minister has a greater grasp of the problems around him than he did in August. Now the economic situation is on a knife edge and it is completely the wrong time for us to focus on internal party dissent.\"</p> <p>The prime minister was reported to have been given loud applause for what Labour MPs regard to have been a successful party conference speech and subsequent cabinet reshuffle. </p> <p>He told the room the party could still win the next election despite trailing in the polls, with a government aide saying Brown had told the meeting that \"people's minds are not yet set\". The aide said: \"We're back in the game.\"<br>Some in the room said Howarth's speech could even be interpreted as an \"apology\".</p> <p>Brown also announced that the Glenrothes byelection would be held on November 6. Critics have said that the Labour party is bracing itself to lose the seat and scheduling the byelection in the days immediately following the American elections could obscure a defeat.</p> <p>One of Brown's more controversial reshuffle appointments, Peter Mandelson, spent the afternoon of his first day back in Westminster in hospital undergoing an emergency operation to have a kidney stone removed.</p> <p>Mandelson experienced kidney pains over the weekend and was admitted to hospital yesterday afternoon. He was able to attend the first session of Gordon Brown's newly formed National Economic Council in the morning before admission to hospital and his office said he was back in meetings by teatime yesterday.</p> <p>It also emerged that the deputy leader of the Labour party, Harriet Harman, had condemned in private to friends Brown's decision to sack Parmjit Dhanda in the weekend reshuffle. Dhanda is the government's only elected minister from the Indian community.</p> <p>Harman texted friends to say that the decision was bad for the government and the party. She is said to be demanding his dismissal be reversed at a later date.</p> <p>The new parliamentary session presents immediately challenges to Brown, not least over the controversial legislation to increase the time limit for detention without charge to 42 days. There were reports yesterday that the government was even preparing to drop the bill, which faces defeat when it returns to the House of Lords this week. </p> <p>The government was thought to be gearing up to use the Parliament Act to force the legislation through and yesterday the government denied reports it was considering dropping attempts to push the legislation through, saying the position had not changed. </p> <p>The prime minister's official spokesman said: \"Pushing ahead with the 42 days legislation is the right thing to do, given that the House of Commons has expressed its will.\"</p> <p>Yesterday, the Tories announced only a limited reshuffle, appointing rising star Greg Clark to their front bench to shadow Ed Miliband at the newly created Department for Climate Change and the Environment.</p>",
  "<h2>SAP says firms are cutting spending on software</h2> <p>SAP, Europe's largest software company, admitted yesterday that the global financial crisis has caused major corporate customers to hold off spending. The German company saw its shares plunge more than 15% after warning that third-quarter revenues were \"below our expectations\". Henning Kagermann, chief executive, admitted that recent developments in the market had \"been dramatic and worrying to many businesses\".

It added: \"In a direct response to our need to reduce costs and deliver greater efficiencies, we have also made the difficult decision to close our distribution centre in Severnside, Bristol.\"<br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Insurer withdraws cover for JJB Sports' suppliers</h2> <p>Shares in the sportswear chain JJB Sports hit a record low yesterday after an insurer refused to cover suppliers against the firm being unable to pay them. The French-owned Coface, one of the world's biggest credit insurers, confirmed it had withdrawn its cover. The decision comes a week after JJB posted half-year losses of \u00a39.7m and its auditors said there was \"significant doubt\" about its ability to continue as a going concern. Shares in JJB tumbled 25% to 27p, valuing the group at just \u00a364.5m.

EasyJet said passenger numbers in September rose 22%, from 3.4 million in the same month last year to 4.2 million. Analysts said that the acquisition of GB Airways, which has destinations including the Canary Islands, allied with the collapse of XL, had kept up demand. EasyJet's passenger load factor, which measures how many seats are sold per flight, rose by nearly two percentage points to 86.9%. <br><strong>Dan Milmo </strong></p>",
  "<p>Leading shares came close yesterday to repeating the collapse seen on Black Monday in October 1987.

The <strong>FTSE 250</strong> mid-cap index also saw a dramatic decline, down 520.8 points to 7474.8.

  "<p>Jonathan Glancey doesn't want ecotowns to be built (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/02/greenbuilding.planning\">Green and unpleasant</a>, October 2). Fair enough. The campaign against them is vocal, and the government has its work cut out trying to justify them. \"Pity the residents,\" says Glancey. \"Not only will they have to live in developer-built dormitory suburbs given a fashionable name, they will also be the subject of unprecedented scrutiny by quango folk.\"</p> <p>But if ecotowns have a point, it must surely be to explore how we can live sustainably. Unless you monitor performance, I wonder exactly how you would gauge their success. You can call that \"nosy-parker scrutiny\"; or take a less romantic view of real life and recognise that nobody will replicate a success that you cannot prove.</p> <p>Glancey recoils at the thought of thermographic cameras checking heat loss from homes, and bizarrely suggests that \"ecotownies partial to lamb cutlets and to cream on their strawberries might yet be watched as closely as al-Qaida suspects\". (Believe me, there won't be the resources.) But monitoring is not about snooping on individuals - it's about collecting evidence for developing policy and managing change.</p> <p>Glancey is incredulous that transport emissions and diet should be monitored. Yet most residents of new developments have to drive to get to any facilities. They generally have poor access to fresh, healthy, local food. Ecotowns have to be designed differently to be worthy of their name, so why not see if diet does change with more allotments and local retailers? We need to know if health really improves in a walkable town. These are lessons which could be applied way beyond 10 ecotowns.</p> <p>His belief, of course, is that monitoring equates with intrusive regulation of our personal lives. Nonsense. Without checking, for instance, how would we know that when people move into the German ecosuburb of Vauban, most choose to forgo their \"right\" to park outside their house in favour of a largely car-free environment that children can treat as one big playground? If that's \"illiberal\", count me in.</p> <p>Glancey also accuses our organisation of hypocrisy - of \"encouraging\" a new Tesco which will undermine the sustainability of his home town. As the government's design advisers, our commission reviews hundreds of schemes a year of all types. This particular store offers a better design than the many other Tesco stores that we have slammed. Improved architecture doesn't make the contents any more or less acceptable. Whether it should be built at all is, rightly, a decision for the local community.</p> <p>No one is pretending this is easy. But a blithe assertion that \"every town used to be an ecotown\" ignores medieval famine, industrial grimness and the practical realities of today.</p> <p>We need to challenge our existing habits and the default position of developers and government alike. We need to have the courage to test different approaches (in new and existing places). And, funnily enough, we'll need to check and see if all of this is making any difference.</p> <p>\u2022 Matt Bell is director of campaigns for the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment <a href=\"mailto:mbell@cabe.org.uk\">mbell@cabe.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>My home town of Sheffield is to fish-and-chip shops what London is to banks. While at Harvard, I used to start my lectures on the financial sector in developing countries by explaining the difference between them. A good fish-and-chip shop makes its money by adding value to the fish and potatoes that it buys. A good bank makes its money in the same way, on the margin between the money it borrows and the money it lends. </p> <p>But now comes the difference. A criminal can safely be put in charge of a fish-and-chip shop but not of a bank. The former has virtually no assets: if the criminal runs off with the day's fish he cannot retire to Bermuda. But a criminal banker can make a fortune if only he can loot the money that the bank has borrowed: the returns from criminality dwarf running the bank well. </p> <p>In an ideal world the criminals would run fish-and-chip shops, where they could do no harm, and the honest would run the banks. But the market will allocate people in precisely the opposite way: the criminals will move heaven and earth to get into the banks, while the honest will not mind much which job they take. That is why vigilant public scrutiny is essential to prevent looting. </p> <p>Vigilant public scrutiny is, of course, precisely what we have not had. In its absence the business model of our financial sector, while not literally criminal, has been to tap our wealth in its custody by shifting it into opaque assets for high fees. Manifestly, wealth-owners did not adequately understand what was going on. We had been lulled into misplaced trust by decades of regulation-enforced decent behaviour.</p> <p>The regulation which had worked well enough was dismantled because of the recent mantra that finance is the engine of growth as long as it is given free rein. Hence Gordon Brown's emasculation of financial regulation in the UK and Alan Greenspan's era of neglect in the US. This mantra radically exaggerates the upside potential of finance. At best, the contribution of the financial sector to the growth of an economy is second order: it facilitates the creativity of other sectors. Only at its worst is finance first order: as we are now seeing, it can be catastrophic. </p> <p>Self-evidently, in a healthy society the brightest young minds should be heading for those parts of the economy that are truly first order. In Germany the brightest and best have been attracted to critical sectors such as the railways, which is why they function so brilliantly. In Britain the brightest and best have been attracted to the banks, which is why they so brilliantly looted our wealth. Meanwhile, with talentless management our real economy has lurched from failure to failure: from major cock-ups such as the opening of Heathrow's Terminal Five, to trivial such as the three hours taken by my train yesterday from Oxford to London. </p> <p>At last, we have a chance for change. Because the banks do well out of secrecy, to date they have successfully opposed proper scrutiny. The wall of secrecy started to crack after September 11, 2001, when governments forced banks to reveal deposits linked to the finance of terrorism. Incredibly, even that was resisted: Citibank lobbied hard to block it. But now that we have the banks on the run there is an opportunity to extend scrutiny, not only to help ourselves, but to help Africa. </p> <p>The loot-seeking elites that control parts of Africa illicitly send capital out of the region to the tune of $20 to $28bn per year. Illicit money flows are hard to quantify, but this is the new estimate by Raymond Baker of the NGO Global Financial Integrity, the most careful and ingenious study to date. Capital flight of this magnitude is roughly equivalent to the entire aid inflow to the region, so closing it would generate a similar resource transfer to doubling aid. One side-effect of the financial crisis is that aid commitments will be at the front of the queue for spending cuts. For example, in the vice-presidential debate it was the only Democratic spending pledge that Joe Biden suggested might be rethought. </p> <p>While the crisis will weaken our assistance for the poorest countries by curtailing aid, it could inadvertently have an offsetting effect if we use it to close the illicit outflow. Money flows out of Africa into our banks, and into the offshore banks that depend for their existence upon being able to transact with our banks. US rules on banking transparency are even weaker than the European rules: vast sums looted from the public purse in Africa are being held in nominee accounts and moved around the world at greater speed than our cumbersome legal processes can track them down. </p> <p>Western legal systems are stacked, thanks to the hired hands of skilled lawyers, to protect the rights of the crooked over the rights of Africa's ordinary citizens. At the time of the Commission for Africa, I urged that Britain revise its laws on banking secrecy. Yet despite the enormous emotional energy aroused by Gleneagles, there was no political appetite: aid, yes; banking openness, no. The silver lining in this grim cloud is that we have a second chance to clean up the banks. Which takes me back to where I began. There is one thing that a dirty fish-and-chip shop and a dirty bank have in common: they both stink.</p> <p>\u2022 Paul Collier directs the Centre for the Study of African Economies at Oxford University and is the author of The Bottom Billion </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "<p>Lord Stern of Brentford has suggested the credit crunch might provide an opportunity to invest in measures to tackle global warming as a way of stimulating economic growth. </p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian ahead of a speech to launch a new climate change economics centre at the London School of Economics, the author of the government's influential report on climate change, said there were \"two kinds of danger\" because of the current fears of recession. </p> <p>\"One [is] people can only concentrate on a limited number of things at the same time, and the second is people will be sensitive to cost increases, and those will have to be managed carefully,\" he said. \"There's a danger: it needs leadership.\"</p> <p>But, he said, the current problems could help boost investment in tackling climate change because they have highlighted the dangers of not tackling risks early enough, and could create much more international cooperation. </p> <p>There were also more incentives to invest in energy efficiency during a recession and when oil prices were high. Spending on renewable and other low-carbon industries could help stimulate the economy, said Stern. </p> <p>\"We're going to have to grow out of this ... and this is an area which looks as though it could well grow strongly and with the right support could be one of the major engines of growth,\" he said. </p> <p>Stern's comments will be echoed today by the government's Technology Strategy Board, which warns businesses it would be a \"terrible mistake\" to cut investment in new technology during a downturn.</p> <p>\"We will come out of this downturn and when we do, it will be the businesses which held their nerve and continued to invest that will come out of the downturn first [and] emerge stronger,\" Iain Gray, the board's chief executive, will say. </p> <p>Despite the big changes, Stern predicted the information technology revolution would turn out to have been \"more revolutionary\" in the long term. </p> <p>\"We'll still move around, we'll heat our homes - homes will be more efficient and close to zero-carbon electricity.

But at the same time it will be cleaner, quieter, more biodiverse, all those things. It will actually be much nicer.\"</p> <p>Stern's report for the Treasury in 2006 famously described climate change as the world's greatest \"market failure\".

  "<p>Many changes are affecting western societies. New citizens are importing different cultural and religious traditions, families are taking on different configurations, work hours are becoming more varied and the internet is taking over our shopping, entertainment and information-gathering activities. As these changes occur they bring about paradoxes in how we lead our lives. People have become more conscious of individual rights, but are less deferential to those in authority. There is more consideration for children, old people and those with disabilities, but this is accompanied by the growth of new phenomena such as road rage and mob behaviour at bus stops. We participate in television and radio shows, yet show reluctance to cast our votes in elections.</p> <p>Changes in the way our society functions have implications for education. Yet English schools, despite the good work of the government-funded Innovations Unit, are slow to change. This is partly because their core task of teaching and caring for children has remained the same. But the move away from local authority control towards central government direction, tight regulation through Ofsted inspections and the pervasive influence of league tables inhibit all but the most confident of headteachers and governing bodies from experimenting with new approaches. Ironically, it is the most unproven of new categories of schools - academies - that have been given the most freedom to change. </p> <p>Of course, many schools value traditions and are proud of their focus on customary knowledge and time-honoured skills. But even if the essential nature of teaching and learning has not changed much since the 19th century, many aspects of schooling have. The ending of 11-plus selection in the majority of areas, the abolition of corporal punishment and the introduction of a national curriculum and Sats have made the daily experience of pupils today quite different from how it was when I was a boy. </p> <p>Other countries have changed too. Finland's 25-year move towards an equitable comprehensive system has been characterised by an upgrading in teachers' education, the adoption of mixed ability teaching and the introduction of special programmes for children with reading difficulties. In Denmark, upper secondary schools are shifting from traditional academic subjects to a radical new interdisciplinary approach. In Flemish Belgium, an education council, composed of stakeholders, has been given the right to comment on proposed legislation. Nearer home, Wales is experimenting with the development of its own baccalaureate. </p> <p>But should there be more fundamental changes in how pupils are educated in order to better match the way people live today? Should issues such as the sustainability of the environment and the dangers of obesity, drugs and Aids and, in the light of current events, financial education be given more prominence? And should school leaders try to predict which other issues might affect their pupils' future lives?</p> <p>The 21st Century Learning Alliance - a body chaired by Tim Brighouse - argues that heads and teachers need to spend time thinking about future trends and how to prepare for them. This makes sense, but will only lead to increased frustration unless the government re-learns to trust the teaching profession. Of course, accountability must remain and monitoring must be deployed to prevent pupils suffering the effects of ill thought-out schemes. But, if we are going to change teaching more fundamentally, we need some bold experiments to guide us. Two years ago an NUT publication proposed that each local authority should set up an experimental school to form a national network.

  "<p>The online auction house eBay has announced plans to cut more than 1,000 jobs, or 10% of its global workforce, as it looks to save $150m (\u00a385m) a year in the face of slowing sales, the latest evidence that gloom in the world economy is starting to hit major dotcom companies.</p> <p>But the company also shocked Wall Street by announcing it was spending $1.3bn on acquisitions - including $945m on Bill Me Later, which lets US shoppers make purchases online or by phone without the need for a credit card - to bolster its PayPal payments operation.</p> <p>It is also buying a Danish online classifieds site, dba.dk, and a vehicles website, bilbasen.dk, for some $390m in cash.</p> <p>The auction house's chief executive, John Donahoe, admitted that given the state of financial markets, \"to some it may seem counter-intuitive to be making these deals, but we believe it is an appropriate time to bring these companies into our portfolio\". He stressed that eBay's financing was strong and the problems in the global financial market would make \"the strong stronger\". But he admitted \"the economy and strong dollar\" were hurting the business.</p> <p>Three months ago, eBay announced its slowest sales growth since it went public a decade ago. It will announce third-quarter results next week. But yesterday the company said it expected to hit the low end of its revenue guidance, although its profit per share would be better than expected. </p> <p>The company refused to give details of where its 1,000 job losses - plus a reduction in temporary and contract staff - would fall but said it would result in a restructuring charge of $70m to $80m, which it will take in its fourth quarter.</p> <p>The job losses have been rumoured for some time, but eBay's sudden decision to go on the acquisition trail surprised many on Wall Street, especially as its deals come in the face of growing concern about the US economy.</p> <p>Bill Me Later has agreements with some 1,000 retailers, which use it on their websites or in their phone sales departments. More than 4 million people have signed up, many of whom use it because they are reluctant to give credit card or other bank details online. </p> <p>Once they have decided on their purchase, users simply click the Bill Me Later icon on a retailer's website or answer specific security questions on the phone and the transaction is accepted. </p> <p>Users then receive a monthly bill which they can pay by cheque, money order or another payment system, but not with a credit card.</p> <p>Bill Me Later, which was founded eight years ago, tends to deal with larger-ticket items than eBay's own PayPal system and only accepts users with a solid credit history. </p> <p>The deal will make an instant multimillionaire of the founder and chief executive, Gary Marino. It will also generate a handsome return for Bill Me Later's financial backers, which include the investment groups Legg Mason and T Rowe Price, the online retailer Amazon and the investment bank Citigroup.</p>",
  "<p>Shares tumbled. Gordon Brown's economic war cabinet met. The Americans injected another dollop of money into the markets. Iceland was going bust. Just another day in the life of financial markets, now apparently in a state of permanent crisis.</p> <p>Let me kick off this new daily column, designed to explore ways of getting out of the mess we're in, with three challenges facing policymakers. The first is philosophical: much of the past year has been wasted because finance ministries, central banks and international bureaucracies have clung on to a bankrupt ideology. Now the period of denial is over, and that has at last opened up the possibility of a more vigorous policy response. But there is still a reluctance to see the crisis as an opportunity as well as a threat; to put in place the long-term reforms that will stop the lunatics taking over the asylum again.</p> <p>The second challenge is to get the policy framework right. There is absolutely no point in the state taking a stake in the banks or in buying up their \"toxic waste\" if macroeconomic policy is eye-wateringly tight. Patience with Mervyn King is wearing very thin in Whitehall, not just because of his hardline opposition to cuts in interest rates but over what is seen as a foot-dragging approach to sorting out the banking system. </p> <p>Alistair Darling is now not even bothering to disguise his view that it is time for the Bank of England to cut interest rates, and if it doesn't ease policy by half a point this Thursday there will be demands for the chancellor to run monetary policy himself. Rightly so. The only thing that matters in wartime is winning the war. Britain is not alone in suffering from a lack of policy co-ordination; the fact that Angela Merkel announced Germany's go-it-alone guarantee for savers, just hours after Nicolas Sarkozy's summit ended with a declaration of European unity of purpose, is indicative of a wider malaise. Finance has gone global but governance has not.</p> <p>Finally, policymakers need to draw up a \"to do\" list. They have to get ahead of the game. For 14 months they have been reacting to events, with disastrous consequences. Sorting out the banks' problems is the first priority, and it was the extreme stresses in the money markets, with the knock-on effects for businesses trying to raise capital, that spooked the Treasury at the end of last week. There should be a blanket guarantee to all depositors and a commitment to use taxpayers' money to recapitalise strategically important banks. The support should come at a price: root and branch reform of the way banks operate.</p> <p>A bail-out for the banks should be accompanied by a coordinated easing of policy to inject confidence into both financial and consumer markets. Finally, this weekend's meeting of the IMF and World Bank in Washington should be used to sketch out a new international financial architecture. Robert Zoellick, the World Bank's president, made a contribution to this debate yesterday when he called for the anachronistic G7 to be expanded to include seven leading developing countries. That would be sensible, as would toughening up credit rating agency rules and a general beefing-up of the IMF's early warning role in spotting crises.</p> <p>This list does, however, contain one crucial omission - the role of tax havens in undermining the policies of sovereign states. As Richard Murphy of the Tax Justice Network noted yesterday, tax havens provide a \"get-out-of-regulation free\" card for banks faced with tougher sanctions. This card needs to be taken off the table - but to do so will require the sort of global policy coordination so sorely lacking in recent years.</p> <p>\u2022 Larry Elliott and Will Hutton will analyse the latest developments in the financial crisis every Tuesday to Friday for the coming weeks <a href=\"mailto:larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>England's World Cup fate is already written in the stars,\" David Davies says. He spreads his arms wide in a theatrical flourish and rolls his eyes to the heavens. \"You can see it already. We'll be out in South Africa in 2010 and, in the quarter-finals no doubt, it will be Mexico against England. My good friend Sven-Goran Eriksson will smile phlegmatically while the rest of us howl helplessly as it ends in a penalty shoot-out. It's a cast-iron certainty.\" </p> <p>Davies gives a short bark of incredulous laughter before, in his amusing way, his prediction takes us back to a story from his surreal past at the Football Association, where he eventually ended up as executive director. The anecdote follows Eriksson and Davies as they gatecrash yet another hen party before he returns to the present and fond speculation as to what his Swedish pal might be up to in his new role as the manager of Mexico.</p> <p>This is how a couple of hours pass in Davies's garrulous company. Memories of mishap and scandal, hubris and anguish spill from his dozen years at the muddled heart of English football. His new book, FA Confidential: Sex, Drugs and Penalties, provides an insider's account of a bizarre culture of mismanagement. Davies was propelled up and down the roller coaster of the English game so often that he still sounds positively giddy when recounting the absurdity of it all.</p> <p>Davies, of course, was reduced to locking himself and Kevin Keegan into a toilet cubicle at Wembley, to plead with the then England manager not to resign after humiliation against Germany in 2000. He had lost his previous England manager after Glenn Hoddle, babbling about reincarnation, suggested that disabled people were paying the price for the sins of their previous lives. In recent years he endured revelations that his personal assistant, Faria Alam, had conducted simultaneous affairs with England's latest manager, Eriksson, and Mark Palios, Davies's boss at the FA. Davies was then accused, falsely, by Alam of sexual harassment.</p> <p>During quieter times at Soho Square Davies dealt with Tony Adams and Paul Gascoigne's battles with the bottle, the England squad's threat to strike after Rio Ferdinand was banned for missing a drugs test, George Graham's bungs and Eric Cantona attacking an abusive Crystal Palace supporter with a kung-fu kick to the chest.</p> <p>The madness leads to humour; and an interview with Davies is heavily seasoned with comic bewilderment. The infamous Cantona episode provides a typical example. \"There we were at Cantona's disciplinary hearing,\" Davies chortles, \"and Maurice Watkins, defending Eric as United's lawyer, made an eloquent plea of 'guilty with mitigation'. I'd heard the story about how, in front of a French disciplinary committee, Cantona smacked an official. So when Geoff Thompson, our disciplinary chairman, said, 'We haven't heard from Mr Cantona,' I expected fireworks. Eric began with great dignity: 'I would like to thank the chairman, I would like to thank Manchester United, I would like to thank Mr Ferguson, I would like to thank the prostitute with whom I slept last night, I would like to thank...'</p> <p>\"As he rambled on I looked at the expression on Maurice's face and I knew my ears weren't deceiving me. That was a great Cantona moment and the precursor to his famous 'When the seagulls follow the trawler' speech. I adapted that saying as a mantra for myself at the FA: 'When the seagulls follow the trawler, why do they always shit on me?'\"</p> <p>Those mythical seagulls dumped on Davies most embarrassingly when he was tagged \"The Third Man\" in a supposed triangle of middle-aged men having sex with Ms Alam. For once the laughter curdles and Davies reveals how his reputation, both as a former BBC journalist and as one of the more sane FA members, was briefly shredded by Alam's allegations of harassment.</p> <p>\"It took nine months to clear my name and it was a nightmare. In these cases it's usually one person's word against another but there was so much evidence against Faria that, in the end, the truth emerged so decisively in my favour I could not have written it more forcefully myself. But it scarred me. I bore the brunt of Faria's deception and after 12 years I thought the FA would defend me. They left me high and dry.</p> <p>\"But none of this was Sven's fault. He was great fun and there were some illuminating moments when he admitted being surprised that this bloke from Torsby in Sweden ended up where he did. But Sven is intriguing. At coaching conventions [Raymond] Domenech and [J\u00fcrgen] Klinsmann would go crazy when they saw Sven. Domenech would say, 'God has arrived!'\"</p> <p>Davies waxes further about Eriksson before, suddenly, he stops himself with another joke. \"I must confirm that Sven and I did not sleep together. However, he did sleep in the Queen's bed at Hillsborough Castle. We went up for George Best's funeral and Peter Hain suggested we stay with him at Hillsborough. We got there before Peter arrived and walked down to the nearest pub on a Friday evening. Of course we found another hen party. Sven's capacity to find a restaurant or pub where they were having a hen night was quite ridiculous. We had a great time, with Sven surrounded by women, before returning to the castle where he slept in the Queen's bed - alone, I presume.\"</p> <p>If Eriksson and Terry Venables are the England managers Davies remembers most warmly, he also defends Hoddle and Keegan. \"Glenn was strong tactically and his achievement in Italy [when England secured the draw they needed to qualify for the 1998 World Cup] was exceptional. I think Glenn might figure again as England coach one day.\"</p> <p>If that seems unlikely, at least we know for certain that Keegan won't attempt another crack at international management. His recent travails with Newcastle induce a sympathetic wince from Davies. \"I was surprised Kevin went back to Newcastle but he is such an instinctive person and I just hope he's isn't lost to football now. I did the interview with him on Radio Five when Kevin said he was going to stand by Joey Barton. I thought that was a difficult call and the fractious relationship between him and Mike Ashley simply hardened then.\"</p> <p>Davies is emphatic that, had he remained at the FA after the 2006 World Cup, he would have pushed hard for the appointment of Guus Hiddink. The FA, instead, bungled its pursuit of Luiz Felipe Scolari and ended up with Steve McClaren. Davies suggests that watching England, under McClaren, lose so miserably to Croatia in the final qualification game for Euro 2008 prompted him to write his revelatory book.</p> <p>\"But I like Steve,\" he grins, \"and spoke to him last month.\"</p> <p>Did McClaren talk in his new Dutch accent? \"No,\" Davies laughs. \"I'm not sure what happened to Steve and the accent.\"</p> <p>The fact that McClaren ended up as England manager becomes easier to understand when Davies describes the shambolic FA - filled by men like Geoff Thompson, nicknamed \"Uncle Albert\" or \"Mr Invisible\", and Dave \"The Lollipop Man\" Richards. \"These are not unpleasant nicknames,\" Davies backtracks, \"and the FA has some good people. But English football has had such trouble because it is hopelessly split between the conflicting interests of the Premier League, the FA and the Football League.</p> <p>\"Lord Triesman, the FA's new independent chairman, has a great opportunity to stand above the fighting and force people to work out our agreed priorities. He appears to be working extremely hard for a part-timer but we need a full-time independent chairman who is elected every four years. We need much greater accountability and cohesion.</p> <p>\"We're not doing enough for either England or the clubs. If you set aside last season's Champions League final, Premier League clubs have not been brilliant. Since the Premier League began there have been 14 finals, 28 teams and only four were English. How many English clubs won the Champions League in that time? Two.\"</p> <p>Davies agrees that Richard Scudamore, the Premier League's chief executive, is unlikely to have completely shelved his ridiculed plan to play English club matches abroad. </p> <p>\"I'm less critical of the internationalisation of an already international competition than some and I think Richard will revisit it - if not in the same format. The idea that your club would play 18 teams twice but a 19th side three times just doesn't work. I understood his aim of widening the League's global appeal, but of course it was me who suggested we play an FA Cup final in Paris when Wembley was rebuilt. Not for the first or last time I was in a minority of uno.\"</p> <p>He makes a more serious point in arguing that the \"psychological affliction\" which often takes hold of players in an England shirt is caused less by hysterical media pressure than the conflict between the varying governing bodies. \"When there is no unity off the field it's little wonder we struggle on the pitch. But I did go to the 1966 World Cup final at Wembley and I still hope England might eventually win it again. We need to change the dynamics of conflict - and get lucky.\"</p> <p>That final mention of the World Cup takes us right back to Davies's seer-like certainty of a fateful showdown between England and Mexico in 2010. \"It will happen,\" he chuckles. And then, as if the horror finally strikes him, Davies groans. \"England have gone out of four of their last six major tournaments on penalties. But honestly, if we lose to Mexico on penalties, with Sven smiling sympathetically, I will give up on English football forever.\" </p> <p><em>David Davies's FA Confidential: Sex, Drugs and Penalties is published by Simon &amp; Schuster (\u00a317.99)</em></p>",
  "<p>The US financial markets were on the brink of a record-breaking slump today as Wall Street reacted to signs that the credit crunch is spiralling out of control to threaten the stability of economies around the globe.</p> <p>As European governments struggled to contain banking failures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted by 800 points at one stage, exceeding last week's largest ever one-day points drop of 777.</p> <p>The blue-chip index staged a modest rally during the final hour of trading in New York to close with a fall of 369 points to 9,955. But it was the first time the Dow had fallen below 10,000 since October 2004, with banks and struggling car companies leading the rout.</p> <p>Analysts at the investment bank Morgan Stanley warned that problems originating in the US financial system were ricocheting around the world: \"The recession now threatens to go global, with industrial economies on the brink, and trade and financial shocks threatening the developing world.\"</p> <p>As stocks plunged, the US treasury wasted little time in getting its contentious $700bn bail-out of the banking industry under way. </p> <p>The treasury tonight named a high-ranking official, Neel Kashkari, to head a new office of financial stability and began soliciting for asset managers to help manage the purchase of banks' distressed securities. </p> <p>In six business days, the Dow has slumped by nearly 11% and prices are 30% below their peak, reached in October 2007. </p> <p>The Federal Reserve tried to shore up financial stability today by doubling the amount of money available for short-term lending to banks from $300bn to $600bn.</p> <p>\"You're seeing a tremendous amount of nervousness,\" said Anthony Conroy, head trader at BNY ConvergEx in New York. \"People are seeing this crisis go beyond the US \u2013 they're realising it's a global crisis.\"</p> <p>Investors' concerns about the international financial system were exacerbated by problems afflicting the German mortgage firm Hypo Real Estate. In the US, two major state governments \u2013 California and Massachusetts \u2013 say they may need loans from the federal government to tide them over.</p> <p>Tobias Levkovich, chief US market strategist at Citigroup, said there was a volatile market mood as \"the credit crisis has deepened and the economic news out of Europe continues to be almost universally bad\". But he expressed optimism that stocks were approaching a bottom, pointing to trends in previous recessions, to the ratio of funds' cash holdings and to a \"sense of resignation within investor sentiment\".</p> <p>On Wall Street, banks suffered a severe sell-off and there was bad news after the market closed as Bank of America revealed a 68% drop in profits to $1.18bn. The firm said it was embarking on a $10bn fundraising and it halved its dividend payout to shareholders.</p> <p>\"These are the most difficult times for financial institutions that I have experienced in my 39 years in banking,\" said Bank of America's chief executive, Kenneth Lewis.</p> <p>Struggling car manufacturers were dealt a blow by a warning from Volkswagen which admitted it would miss its target of selling 100,000 vehicles in the US this year. Ford dropped by almost 9% and General Motors by 6%.</p> <p>\"We all had anticipated some degree of economic adversity,\" Volkswagen's US chief Johan de Nysschen told Bloomberg News. \"We didn't imagine the largest one-day drop in the history of mankind.\"</p> <p>On a visit to Texas, President George Bush met a group of small business leaders at a soda shop in San Antonio to discuss their personal experiences of the credit crunch. Speaking outside, he warned that the government's bail-out plan would take some time to work even after Friday's approval by Congress, ending a political battle over the policy.</p> <p>\"It's going to take a while to get in place a programme that, one, is effective and, two, doesn't waste taxpayers' money,\" said Bush. \"We don't want to rush into the situation and have the program not be effective.\"</p> <p>Wall Street's tumble was part of an international epidemic. </p> <p>Trading was halted at stockmarkets in Russia, Brazil and Peru.<br>\"The issues are worldwide,\" said Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer's Investment Research. \"People are scared and the only thing they're doing is selling.\"</p>",
  "<p>It was a showdown to cherish for critics of Wall Street's culture of enrichment. The grim-faced boss of the bankrupt bank Lehman Brothers was left squirming with discomfort today as a veteran Democrat roasted him over his multi-million dollar pay.</p> <p>With the startled look of a man unaccustomed to sharp examination, Lehman's chief executive, Richard Fuld, clashed bluntly with the chairman of the House oversight committee, Henry Waxman, on Capitol Hill.</p> <p>Called upon to explain why Lehman collapsed last month, Fuld began with a note of humility, saying he felt \"horrible\" over the demise of the 158-year-old institution. \"I want to be very clear,\" said Fuld. \"I take full responsibility for the decisions I made and for the actions I took.\"</p> <p>In a brief speech that was heard in silence, Fuld told lawmakers that if he could turn back the clock, he would do many things differently. As soon as he finished speaking, sparks began to fly. The chairman of the committee held up a chart suggesting that Fuld's personal remuneration totalled $480m over eight years \u2013 including payouts of $91m in 2001 and $89m in 2005.</p> <p>\"Your company is now bankrupt and out country is in a state of crisis,\" said Waxman, a liberal lawmaker from California. \"You get to keep $480m. I have a very basic question \u2013 is that fair?\" After a long pause, Fuld demurred, saying the figure was exaggerated: \"The majority of my compensation, sir, came in stock. The vast majority of the stock I got I still owned at the point of our [bankruptcy] filing.\"</p> <p>Waxman cut him off, saying that even if the figure was slightly lower, it was \"unimaginable\" to much of the public. \"Is that fair, for a CEO of a company that's now bankrupt, to make that kind of money? It's just unimaginable to so many people.\" Waxman asked. \"I would say to you the $500m number is not accurate,\" said Fuld. \"I'd say to you, although it's still a large number, for the years you're talking about here, my cash compensation was close to $60m, which you've indicated here, and I took out closer to $250m [in shares].\"</p> <p>Interrupting again, Waxman listed Fuld's collection of property \u2013 including a $14m ocean-front villa in Florida and a home in the exclusive ski resort of Sun Valley, Idaho. \"You and your wife have an art collection filled with million dollar paintings,\" said Waxman. \"Your former president, Joe Gregory used to travel to work in a helicopter.\"<br>The pugnacious Waxman warmed to his theme: \"You made all this money taking risks with other peoples' money.\"</p> <p>Refusing to give ground, Fuld said his pay had been set by an independent compensation committee which spent \"a tremendous amount of time\" making sure executives' interests were aligned with those of shareholders.</p> <p>\"When the company did well, we did well,\" said Fuld. \"When the company did not do well, we didn't do well.\" Waxman disagreed: \"Mr Fuld, there seems to be a breakdown, because you did very well when the company was doing well and you did well when the company was not doing well. And now your shareholders who owned your company have nothing. They've been wiped out.\"</p> <p>Fuld's evidence on Capitol Hill was his first public appearance since Lehman failed, sparking a chain of events that have sent shockwaves through the global financial system and has prompted the US government to begin a $700bn bail-out of the banking industry.</p> <p>A lifelong Lehman employee who joined the firm as an intern in 1966, Fuld has been blamed for the debacle by many of the bank's 28,000 staff \u2013 including those in London who have accused senior management of filleting Lehman's British operation of money in the bank's final days.</p> <p>Deadpan and emotionless, Fuld repeatedly frustrated congressmen by answering questions with lengthy, technical financial explanations. Frustrated by his demeanour, a Republican congressman, John Mica, tried humour. \"If you haven't discovered your role, you're the villain today,\" said Mica. \"You've got to act like a villain.\"</p> <p>Fuld stared back wordlessly, without a shadow of a smile. Towards the end of his two hours of evidence, Fuld told Congress that until the final hours of the bank, he believed a takeover by Barclays would save Lehman Brothers from bankruptcy. In the event, Barclays waited until after Lehman had collapsed before buying the remnants of its US operations.</p> <p>\"Not that anyone on this committee cares about this but I wake up every single night wondering 'what could I have done differently?'\" Fuld said. \"In certain conversations, what should I have said? What could I have done? I have searched myself every single night.\" Raising his voice, Fuld continued: \"This is a pain that will stay with me for the rest of my life.\"</p>",
  "<p>Tina Brown, one of the most distinguished magazine editors of her generation who blazed a trail through the media capitals of London and New York, today embarked on her latest venture: to test her legendary skills in the printed word in the anarchic environment of cyberspace.</p> <p>Brown unveiled her new offering, the Daily Beast, with a launch devoid of fanfare. The website is her first venture into the wild west of internet publishing, and will be followed acutely by media watchers curious to see how the editor of such titans of old media as Vanity Fair and the New Yorker will fare.</p> <p>The website has a clean and elegant design that is Brown's hallmark, aided by the fact that it is as yet uncluttered by online advertising.</p> <p>It is positioned somewhere in the middle of the Drudge Report and the HuffingtonPost, both in terms of content and political placement.<br>It has more original content than Drudge - at about a third of the new site - though less than the HuffPo. But like Drudge it also acts as an aggregator, linking to stories of the day as chosen by its small team of editors under its motto \"Read this, skip that.\"</p> <p>Politically, it seeks a non-partisan tone, in contrast to the spikey rightist edge of Drudge and the unashamed liberalism of the HuffPo. Its contributors span the spectrum, from the architect of the conservative revolution, Newt Gingrich, to Bill Clinton who makes an appearance on launch day with his selection on books on the financial crisis.</p> <p>Brown has much riding on the fate of the Daily Beast. Financially, it will have a fraction of the running costs of her last big foray into publishing, Talk magazine - and those will be born by Barry Diller's group InterActiveCorp of which the website forms a part.</p> <p>But the collapse of Talk in 2002 dented her reputation as an editor<br>with the golden touch, and this may or may not be her chance to regain it.</p> <p>Sree Sreenivasan, professor of new media at Columbia Journalism School, said the chances of success were good. \"People are finding it hard to keep up amid the explosion of news and information, and they're looking for ways to cut through the clutter like this.\"</p> <p>The name of the site is drawn from Brown's favourite novel, Evelyn<br>Waugh's Scoop - a curious allusion to the excesses of Fleet Street<br>newspapers for a start-up with no formal links to the old print medium. </p> <p>But then she is self-deprecating about her own lack of web-savvy skills, confessing on the site that she is a \"real dinosaur\" who was born in an era when the smallest computer was the size of a subway car. But she protests: \"I'm not completely sure how a printing press works, but that never stopped me.\"</p> <p>She also seeks to meet head-on suggestions that her site is a pale imitation of Arianna Huffington's by now hugely successful site, denying that she is jealous of her rival and calling her a \"very old friend\". Huffington repaid the compliment saying, \"I'm very glad to see her diving into the internet. The more sites there are offering smart, compelling content, the more people will get their news, opinion and entertainment online and that's good for all of us.\"<br></p>",
  "<p>If one wanted a definitive measure of the anti-European bias of our financial commentators, it has been the exaggerated reaction to present uncertainties over national government bank support schemes within the European Union. Of course, the current competitive bailouts are highly undesirable, as the reaction of the markets has shown. They should and will, doubtless, be replaced by a more coherent and coordinated approach, not least as a result of the fallout we have seen. There is no alternative to this. </p> <p>But it is ludicrous to hear the errors of the weekend, particularly by the Germans, being criticised by precisely those people who in the past have been most hostile to any form of strong central macroeconomic policy direction at an EU level. Similar sentiments also dominate the deliberation of our political establishment. Even the supposedly pro European Liberal Democrats, for all the undoubted credibility of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/vincentcable\">Vince Cable</a> in at least predicting the present debacle, believe that Britain's membership of the Euro is completely off the agenda as part of the response to the crisis. But, in fact, it is becoming abundantly apparent that nothing short of a completely new economic strategy will meet the scale of the problems we now face, and this must mean (as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/01/economy.economics\">mooted by Will Hutton</a>) a move towards the single currency. We would need to indicate that it was our eventual intention to do this, in order to put in place any sustainable alternative programme. <br> For what we are really seeing now is the demise of the entire policy direction that the British economy has adopted, arguably, since the collapse of Bretton Woods, and certainly since the ERM crisis in 1992, as reinforced by Gordon Brown's City reforms and failure to join the Euro of 1997-98. Just as in foreign policy, in economic policy too, we chose to hitch ourselves excessively to the United States, rather than to Europe. </p> <p>However, without the scale and entrepreneurial culture of the Americans, our problems are now potentially deeper. The only exception to this is that, being a crowded island, there is more of a natural floor under property prices here, although this will be cold comfort if unemployment were to take off significantly. The other numbers are grim indeed. The government has, in percentage terms, a larger current fiscal deficit than that of the US and those of all EU countries save Hungary. Fifty-three per cent of all credit card debt in the EU is in Britain. One in five households here has less than 52 days financial surplus, in the event of a loss of income. We are more exposed than any other major economy to a significant rise in global protectionism and to a sustained downturn in financial and related international services. <br> The current crisis has greatly strengthened the traditional arguments for Euro membership, of being part of a continental scale, fully-integrated market. It has also greatly increased the risks of being semi-detached from such a market. The rise of Asia has become structurally inflationary, rather than deflationary. This penalises devaluations and rewards monetary stability. </p> <p>Of course, as Ireland's experience has shown, Euro membership is no easy panacea. But the property crash in the Republic is only a problem because Irish banks have retained a British-style lending culture and the Irish government a British-style approach both to banking supervision and fiscal policy. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/30/santander.bradfordbingley\">stronger situation of the banks</a> and of the public finances in Spain, for example, shows that this need not have been the case. Moreover, Ireland's longer-term prospects for recovery would be substantially worse were she not now in the Eurozone. <br> Joining the Euro would also address the UK's particular present difficulties with regard to the credibility of our monetary and fiscal policy. We need lower interest rates in order to head off recession, but higher rates in order to head off inflation. Any lowering of rates will further weaken Sterling and import inflation. Joining the Euro at or near the present highly competitive exchange rate would square this circle. It would allow a domestic stimulus with a greatly reduced inflationary risk. This is particularly the case since the government's fiscal policy has fallen apart. </p> <p>Restoring confidence in the medium-term stability of our public finances, on our own, will be onerous. Far better to indicate our resolve to adopt properly the Maastricht rules on sustainable deficits. Of course, these are imperfect. Jean-Claude Trichet (the governor of the European Central Bank) has been one of many leaders of the Eurozone to urge for more robust and transparent structures by the finance ministries of participating states. But already, they have proved a more effective discipline than Gordon Brown's prudence, and they certainly beat George Osborne's pathetic suggestion of some sort of national debt commission. </p> <p>As the economic downturn continues, and the relative scale of taxpayer support for the distressed banking system between the UK and the Eurozone becomes apparent, it is likely that their credibility will become more robust, whereas the reverse is likely to be the case for us as we will be constantly tempted or perceived to be tempted, to escape our obligations through devaluation. In this regard, it is worth recalling that the Eurozone has much more potential new fire power to deploy in dealing with a deep recession than the United States. The EU has no federal budget, but it could create one. The ECB has substantial foreign exchange reserves. The Fed has none. The ECB now has considerable scope for reducing interest rates. The Fed has already moved significantly to provide such stimulus. </p> <p>Finally, restoring the credibility of the Bank of England and the FSA with regard to general financial stability, which has been shot to pieces by Northern Rock and its aftermath, on our own, in current circumstances, will also be extremely onerous. Far better to buy into the now-strong credibility in this regard of the ECB, and to participate fully in the emerging debate for European level banking regulations as part of an eventual comprehensive international accord with America and Asia. <br> Beyond these considerations, however, lurks the issue of whether London's status as a world financial centre can be maintained without a lender of last resort in a global reserve currency, since the Bank of England can clearly only print Sterling. This question may be coming to the fore right now, if we are indeed called upon and have to deliver any comprehensive bailout for our banking system, similar to that being undertaken in the United States. </p> <p>In any event, such considerations must dominate a sober assessment of where this crisis has left the City's fundamental competitive position over the medium term. Several experts, notably <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/~wbuiter/\">Willem Buiter</a>, have been making this new argument for Euro membership that was not around in 1997/8, the last time that the issue was a serious prospect for the UK, and that has arisen as a direct result of the revolution in financial engineering of the past decade. It is a thesis that has been given weight over the past few months by what has happened in Iceland, which went on an enormous leveraged investment spree, not least on the British high street, and has now been basically rescued by a consortium of the Norwegian, Swedish and Danish central banks, making the Icelandic Krona just a currency board unit. Ultimately, as the Icelandic Ttrade unions have indicated, their country will have to join the Euro, though how they can manage this without being in the EU is a mystery. </p> <p>The implications of this crisis for Euro membership for both Denmark and Sweden must also be significant. Now, the City of London is obviously not Iceland, but it does have some of the features of a giant, highly-leveraged hedge fund, which will be progressively exacerbated if the prevailing investment and credit climate continues. Iceland has accumulated external foreign currency assets and exposure of nearly 800% of its GDP. For Britain, the equivalent number is 500%; for the United States, 100% and for the Eurozone 30%. It is not difficult to see why the fundamentals of the Euro are strong. <br> At some stage, perhaps sooner than our political leadership can imagine, all these issues will force themselves to the attention both of expert and of wider popular opinion. The latter is already susceptible to looking again at the Euro on account of Sterling's recent weakness and as the economic climate deteriorates, and may be increasingly open to any alternative to muddling through in the old way as people are obliged to be more receptive to any answer that reassures their deep and growing fears for their personal financial future. </p> <p>Their impatience with politicians, meanwhile. who tell them only that they have the experience to see them through, or they would not have started from here, or they told us that this would happen, without saying anything new, is growing. Joining the Euro, as part of a basic reordering of the UK economy, away from American models towards European norms, in everything \u2013 from our credit and investment culture, to reconnecting our financial sector, to the long-term strategic interest of the wider economy \u2013 is not just any answer. It is the right answer.</p>",
  "<p>I have been trying for the past week to make sense of the stunning faux-populism exhibited by a majority of US congressional representatives when faced with the very real possibility of a global financial meltdown.</p> <p>That the <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/investing/la-na-econpoll24-2008sep24,0,5568395.story\">majority of Americans</a> opposed a package defined up front as a bail-out for the elites rather than a shoring-up operation for the entire economy is <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/106114/Six-Oppose-Wall-Street-Bailouts.aspx\">not in doubt</a>. At least until the calamitous stock market response to the House of Representatives voting down the bail-out plan last Monday, most Americans clearly thought a credit crisis was something that only affected wealthy people and the bail-out something that would solely benefit millionaires at the expense of the rest of us.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/business/2008/oct/03/useconomy.marketturmoil\">Chastened by the market slide</a>, the <a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jdH_jFDkWlSEeZocD5AIpAwxEfBA\">Senate passed a revised version</a> of the bail-out plan on Wednesday, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/03/creditcrunch.useconomy2\">the House approved it on Friday</a>. But that a majority of representatives originally felt the public was not only against the bill but so passionately against it that they would vote out of office its supporters is more interesting.</p> <p>Why the rage? I think it goes way beyond schadenfreude, not wanting to help out fat cats who had a fall coming to them, way beyond even the sheer $700bn sticker-price shock of the bail-out request. It hints, instead, at a growing, if still inchoate, realisation that the social contract has broken down.</p> <p>In response to <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sasha-abramsky/waiting-for-the-deluge_b_130416.html\">a piece I wrote last week</a> for the Huffington Post on the collapse of the congressional vote, one blogger wrote that things were already so bad that he or she had nothing left to lose. \"Burn, baby, burn,\" the respondent urged. In other words, yes, the credit crunch might pull a whole lot of economic edifices down on top of us, but we're so poor anyway who cares?</p> <p>Sure, it's nihilistic. And nihilism is something that, supposedly, has no place beside the anything's possible tenets of the American dream. But it's not an entirely unreasonable position. About 10% of white adults and 25% of black and Latino adults don't have bank accounts, and the number is growing as more people slide into poverty - which means their credit system consists of exploitative check-cashing centres and payday loans with sky-high interest rates. The minimum wage might keep people from literally starving, but it doesn't pay enough to allow them to live in decent homes, eat three square meals a day and purchase needed medicines.</p> <p>And yet the economy has been restructured so that more and more jobs are at, or not too far above, the minimum wage. McDonalds, Wal-Mart - the new titans are the companies that pay pitiable wages and skimp on benefits. Their employees work long hours just to stay in place, to avoid that slide from near-poverty into real poverty. About one in three American workers earns less than $10 per hour, the amount calculated by many economists as representing a baseline <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/may/07/aquestionoffairness\">\"living wage\"</a> given the current cost of living.</p> <p>In recent years, guaranteed pensions have been lost to millions of workers, as companies in industries like airlines and aluminium production declare bankruptcy. Men and women in their 50s who have worked for the same company for years suddenly find themselves with no pensions or health benefits. Supermarkets in many states have introduced two-tier pay rates, pushing down wages and benefits for incoming employees. And workers have had to pony up cash for an ever-higher proportion of their health insurance premiums.</p> <p>These trends have been growing for a generation now. The last few years, in which gas and food prices have soared and the housing market has imploded, are, for many impoverished Americans, simply the icing on this cake.</p> <p>In the past several months, the credit crunch has reduced the life prospects of huge numbers of people. One example: people seeking student loans from private lenders (top-up loans beyond those provided by the government) have seen their interest rates about double, which means it's becoming ever-harder for poor people to go to college just at a time when higher education is becoming ever-more vital as a stepping stone out of poverty.</p> <p>Moreover, an increasing number of businesses are being forced to close, either because consumers aren't buying or banks aren't lending. If anyone doubted the human cost of a collapsing pyramid-scheme economy, consider the latest unemployment numbers: <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/04/business/economy/04jobs.html?hp\">over 150,000 jobs lost in one month alone</a>. It doesn't take a whole lot of months like that before we're in a severe, and long-lasting recession.</p> <p>Given all of this, it's no surprise that congressional delegations have been inundated with calls and emails expressing outrage at the Wall Street bail-out. \"Where were you, the federal government,\" these people are saying, \"when we needed help paying our bills and staying in our homes?\" </p> <p>Unfortunately, in this case, the political reaction against moves intended to free up credit is worsening an already debilitating situation. It is, in a sense, akin to cutting off one's nose to spite one's face.</p> <p>I don't blame the populace as a whole for this. After all, why should a low-wage employee living in a small home which they are at imminent risk of losing to foreclosure have an in-depth grasp of economics? That's the job of their political leaders. And this past week, as in the years of greed-politics that preceded it and that gutted the economic wellbeing of millions of Americans, those leaders have failed.</p>",
  "<p>The FTSE 100 index suffered its biggest ever one-day points fall today while Wall Street dipped below 10,000 points for the first time in four years, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">fears over the stability of the global banking sector</a> sent markets sliding worldwide.</p> <p>The contagion in the US financial market has had central bankers and politicians across Europe running to reassure savers that their deposits will be protected. </p> <p>At the close in London, the FTSE 100 was down 391.1 points at 4589.2, its worst ever closing performance in points terms as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketturmoil\">traders looked for chancellor Alistair Darling to shore up of the UK's banking sector</a>. Shares across the banking sector dropped on fears that any deal would involve the government taking stakes in high street firms.</p> <p>But the wider market was pushed lower when Darling's speech to the House of Commons failed to meet the expectations in the City that were fuelled by weekend reports of a so-called recapitalisation plan, which would have seen <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/banking\">taxpayers' money pumped into high street banks</a>.</p> <p>In the early evening, Darling was believed to be in conversation with several senior banking figures but some in the Square Mile had hoped he would unveil a rescue plan today.</p> <p>However, in his speech to MPs following the first meeting of his economic war cabinet, he merely reiterated his promise to do \"whatever is needed\" to maintain financial stability.</p> <p>\"It would be irresponsible to speculate on the specifics of future responses,\" he added. \"Providing a running commentary could add to uncertainty in already febrile market conditions. .. But all practical options must remain open to us.\"</p> <p>The Bank of England, he said, will pump a further \u00a340bn into the financial system on Tuesday to try to unstick the global financial markets.</p> <p>The Financial Services Authority, he added, will also look at whether the savings guarantee of \u00a350,000 - which comes into force on Tuesday - should be increased still further. Several European governments have already moved to guarantee all savings, something which has annoyed the Treasury which had hoped Europe might be able to put on a united front.</p> <p>Following the lead set by Ireland and then Greece, the German, Danish and Austrian governments have all moved to guarantee all savings. The Swedish authorities, meanwhile, doubled their savings guarantee to 500,000 Swedish kroner (\u00a340,000), and Spain warned that it might also announce a protection scheme unless there was coordinated action across Europe.</p> <p>The German finance ministry, however, added that it was not planning any state guarantee for the financial sector itself. Such a move had been mooted after Hypo Real Estate, the country's second-largest property lender, received a \u20ac50bn (\u00a339bn) rescue package after an earlier bail-out failed to ease fears over its future.</p> <p>\"It is the case, as far as I'm aware, no government or the European commission was aware of what the Irish government was proposing to do last week,\" Darling said.</p> <p>\"It does demonstrate the problems that arise when member states take unilateral action because of course it does have a knock-on effect with other member states. The same with Germany - Germany took action yesterday, where as I understand it they made a declaration that's not legally binding, it's a political declaration in relation to guarantees. It does emphasise the need for us all to work together.\"</p> <p>In percentage terms the drop in the FTSE 100 index on Monday is 7.85% or the third worst percentage closing loss in history.</p> <p>The poor performance is beaten only by the crash of 1987 when the index of leading shares lost 10% and 12% in two consecutive days - or roughly 250 points a day.</p> <p>In cash terms, the drop has wiped \u00a393bn off the value of London's top 100 companies.</p> <p>By the time the FTSE 100 closed, the Dow Jones industrial average was down more than 400 points, dipping under the 10,000 level for the first time in four years, and by 1.30pm EDT the Dow had slid even further, losing 530 points to 9793.</p> <p>The share slump saw many investors flock to so-called \"safe havens\" such as gold. In New York, gold futures have risen 5% today on fears that the $700bn (\u00a3380bn) bail-out plan will not be adequate to deal with the growing crisis.</p> <p><strong>New York blues</strong></p> <p>Having watched stockmarkets in Europe and Asia plummet on banking failures, traders in New York began selling heavily from the moment the opening bell rang, with struggling banks and car manufacturers leading the cascade downwards.</p> <p>The Bush administration's $700bn banking bail-out package, signed into law by the president on Friday, had little effect on improving morale. Uncertainty persists as to how quickly the emergency rescue plan can be implemented and critics continue to wonder whether it will be enough to support the stricken financial services industry.</p> <p>\"You're seeing a tremendous amount of nervousness,\" said Anthony Conroy, head trader at BNY ConvergEx in New York. \"People are seeing this crisis go beyond the US - they're realising it's a global crisis.\"</p> <p>In six business days, the Dow has slumped by 11% - a fall kicked off by last Monday's record dive of 777 points.

Two major state governments - California and Massachusetts - have now warned they may need loans from the federal government to tide them over.</p> <p>Tobias Levkovich, chief US market strategist at Citigroup, described a volatile market mood as \"the credit crisis has deepened and the economic news out of Europe continues to be almost universally bad\". But he expressed optimism that stocks were approaching a bottom, pointing to trends in previous recessions, to the ratio of funds' cash holdings and to a \"sense of resignation within investor sentiment\".</p> <p>Banks have suffered a particularly severe sell-off in New York with Goldman Sachs down 7%, Citigroup 9% lower and JP Morgan falling 5%. Heavy industrial companies have sank alongside them, with General Electric down by 4%.</p> <p>Companies across the world are reporting the impact of the crisis on their individual industries. In German SAP admitted that the crisis caused a sudden halt to sales of its software in the last few weeks of September as corporate customers stopped spending due to the crunch.</p> <p>Volkswagen, meanwhile, admitted it would miss its target of selling 100,000 vehicles in the US this year as consumers hold off spending. In the UK, new car sales slumped last month, according to industry figures released on Monday.</p> <p>On a visit to Texas, President Bush met a group of small business leaders at a soda shop in San Antonio to discuss their personal experiences of the credit crunch. Speaking outside, he warned that the government's bail-out plan would take some time to work even after Friday's approval by Congress, ending a political battle over the policy.</p> <p>\"It's going to take a while to get in place a programme that, one, is effective and, two, doesn't waste taxpayers' money,\" he said. \"We don't want to rush into the situation and have the programme not be effective.\"</p> <p>Stockmarkets across the world saw one of their most turbulent day's trading on Monday.</p> <p>The Russian stockmarket had to halt trading on three separate occasions because of the intensity of the share selling with its main index losing over 18%.

  "<p>Iceland enjoyed a fantastic party. Now it is having a huge hangover. </p> <p>The island of 319,000 inhabitants is in the heart of the financial storm. Today, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7654257.stm\">share trading in six of Iceland's biggest financial firms was suspended</a> while waiting for an official announcement. The government is under hard pressure to come up with an economic bailout to rescue the country's financial system. Some analysts argue it won't be able to. </p> <p>Just last week the authorities were forced to nationalise the nation's third-largest bank, Glitnir, taking a 75% share in the firm for 600m euros (\u00a3464m). Iceland's currency, the krona, is plummeting against the euro and the dollar. It is rated the world's third-worst performing currency \u2013 just above Zimbabwe's and Turkmenistan's. Inflation is at a whopping 14% per year, with some suggesting it could soar to 20%. </p> <p>Iceland's problems come after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/apr/17/creditcrunch\">booming times</a>. For the past decade, it was one of the fastest growing economies in Europe, making Icelanders the sixth wealthiest people among OECD economies. It was an incredible achievement for a country that, just 50 years ago, was a poor nation surviving mainly on fishing.</p> <p>The three biggest Icelandic banks, Kaupthing, Landsbanki and Glitnir, became global players and helped finance Icelandic companies that expanded aggressively abroad. In Britain, investment firm Baugur got stakes in French Connection, Woolworths, Whistles and, ironically, Iceland supermarkets. Kaupthing chairman Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson, a billionaire, has owned West Ham FC since 2006. </p> <p>The problem was that this runaway expansion was financed on credit. Thanks to free market reforms, fish quota cash and a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/05/iceland.creditcrunch\">stock market based on stable pension funds</a>, Icelandic banks were allowed to borrow vast amounts of money on international markets. </p> <p>And they took it out by the truckload. Between them Kaupthing, Landsbanki and Glitnir hold assets equivalent of 888% of <a href=\"http://www.sedlabanki.is/lisalib/getfile.aspx?itemid=5910\">Iceland's GDP</a>, which they mainly financed through debt. They borrowed money at a time when credit was cheap and plentiful. Now that this source of cash has dried up, they have no idea how to refinance their debts. </p> <p>The crisis has been bubbling for months. As the credit crunch hit financial markets, questions were being asked as to whether Iceland could pay back its huge foreign loans. Confidence plummeted. In an extraordinary move in May, the central banks of Denmark, Norway and Sweden said they would lend Iceland 1.5bn euros (\u00a31.1bn) to prop up its economy.</p> <p>It has been argued that some investors enhanced Iceland's financial frailty by speculating on the krona. Earlier this year the governor of the central bank, David Oddsson, blamed a currency dip at the time on \"unscrupulous dealers\". It is hard to know whether there are any truths to these allegations. Whatever the exact causes of the crisis, Iceland will need a strong hangover cure \u2013 if there's any available.</p>",
  "<p>SAP, Europe's largest software company, has admitted that the global financial crisis has caused major corporate customers to suddenly hold off spending. </p> <p>SAP shares plunged more than 15% after the German company warned that its third-quarter revenues are \"below our expectations\". </p> <p>Chief executive Henning Kagermann admitted that recent developments in the market \"have been dramatic and worrying to many businesses ... These concerns triggered a very sudden and unexpected drop in business activity at the end of the quarter.\" </p> <p>The company, which is the world's biggest maker of business-management software, said it expects software and software-related service revenues for the July to September period to come in between \u20ac1.97bn (\u00a31.5bn) and \u20ac1.98bn, which is up about 13% from \u20ac1.74bn last year and a more modest increase than expected.</p> <p>Analysts said they were looking for more information about exactly how dramatic the drop-off in business had been over the last few weeks of September, which marked some of the most turbulent times ever seen in the global financial markets.</p> <p>Kagermann said that throughout its financial third quarter the business had \"felt quite positive\" about meeting its sales and profit forecasts. </p> <p>\"Unfortunately, SAP was not immune from the economic and financial crisis that has enveloped the markets in the second half of September, causing us to report numbers below our expectations.\" he added.</p> <p>The news is likely to have a knock-on effect on UK software and IT companies which help businesses implement SAP software including Axon Group which is currently the subject of a \u00a3441.1m offer from Indian IT firm HCL Technologies.</p> <p>That bid trounced an earlier offer from fellow Indian firm Infosys Technologies.</p>",

  "<p>Alistair Darling's unflappable style can be deeply irritating in a situation which requires a partisan boot-boy. When global banking is in turmoil, on the other hand, and one misjudged word from a finance minister can cause panic on the very flappable markets, Darling's strengths become more obvious. <br><br>When reporting to the Commons today he said very little that MPs did not know already, but he said it very calmly, so that MPs on all sides - among them Vincent Cable and even George Osborne - expressed sympathy with the chancellor's burdens and sounded vaguely grateful in the knowledge that he will not go mad or burst into tears like some.</p> <p>What did today's statement amount to? A clear hint that ministers are considering ways of helping undercapitalised banks to rebuild their capital base, but in ways that protect the taxpayer interest and may - one day - even deliver a profit as normality returns. That, I think, means taking an equity stake. Hence the fall in bank shares today, as rumours swirls. </p> <p>Hence the chancellor's tight-lipped stance, echoed by tight-lipped officials. Best to say nowt until you are ready to say it all. Even the chancellor, not a Mandelsonian figure in the indiscretion stakes, suggested that Hank Paulson's half-cocked, much-amended $700bn rescue plan in Washington caused more grief than was necessary or helpful - and Hank was a master of the Goldman Sachs universe until recently.</p> <p>What Darling did was to recap what ministers and the Bank of England have done since last summer - ranging from the special liquidity scheme and nationalisation of Northern Rock, the rescue of HBOS and Bradford &amp; Bingley, tomorrow's extension of the guarantee on deposits - up from \u00a335k to \u00a350k from tomorrow. Incidentally, that merely extends protection from 97% of savers to 98% (but only 60% of savings). What remains are a few huge deposits. Ministers are still consulting on them in line with what other countries are doing.</p> <p>It's obvious that Whitehall is scared that unilateral action - Dublin's and now Berlin's - may weaken everyone. No, none of those countries guaranteeing all deposits told EU colleagues or the European commission beforehand, Darling confirmed. Not pleased about that, but it's never easy to tell.</p> <p>Officials later explained that the German guarantee is merely a <em>political</em> statement to reassure voters, not a <em>legal</em> one. Remember that deep in the German psyche is the terrible wheelbarrow inflation of the 1920s. For Americans, the trauma is mass unemployment in the 1930s, hence their divergent approaches to this crisis and economic management.</p> <p>What else did Darling do? He told MPs that Northern Rock had already paid off half its taxpayer debt (half of \u00a327bn?), presumably by running down its mortgage book. He rejected Osborne's call for generalised measures rather than his own case-by-case approach, insisting the two were not incompatible. The crisis needs both.</p> <p>The Financial Services Authority is working on better regulation - it messed up what power it had over the Rock - and looking at City pay. Osborne said he was keen not to use taxpayers' money to support excessive pay. Cable said the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates, had better get the message that down here on planet Earth we need a rate cut now. </p> <p>No point in giving the MPC independence if you threaten to interfere as soon as there's a problem, Mr Calm reminded him. Ministers think they have detected a Tory tactic to try to guess what the government is about to do and then announce in advance that's what they would do too. Irritating, but when all sides are meeting together regularly - as a major crisis demands - it's not hard to detect what the other side is going to do. </p> <p>Irritating though, and we almost caught a hint of irritation from Mr Calm when he noted that the shadow chancellor had been \"changing his tune\" - away from market remedies and towards the state. </p> <p>Oh yes, I almost forgot, Dr Ian Paisley also intervened to recall the grim 30s, soup kitchens and hardship. He went on to urge MPs to join him in prayer to almighty God to deflect retribution from us all. MPs shifted uneasily.</p>",
  "<p>The approval of the US financial bail-out on Friday gives the banking system a welcome respite, enabling the US treasury to buy up distressed mortgage and other loans and thus give the banks a greater degree of liquidity. But the implications of the credit crisis have a very long way to run yet. As Winston Churchill said in 1942: \"This is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.\"</p> <p>At the end of last week we saw that the Dutch, Belgian and Luxemberg governments had to step in to effectively take over both <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/06/europeanbanks.europe1\">Fortis</a> and Dexia, the troubled banks caught up by overpaying for a slice of ABN-Amro at the peak of the market. The Icelandic government had to step in to take over Glitnir and Kaupthing looks to be in financial difficulties. At the weekend, the <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/UKNews1/idUKTRE48R0KS20081005\">rescue attempt</a> for Hypo Real Estate, the <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/UKNews1/idUKTRE48R0KS20081006\">German</a> property lender, had to be redrawn and the government announced it was guaranteeing all savings in an attempt to halt panic. </p> <p>Banks always lend far more than their own capital, often a multiple of maybe 20 times, but this is secured against their assets and those of their customers. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/banking\">banking system</a> is thus always based on confidence, because if everyone attempted to withdraw their money at the same time, the banks could not repay it. The problem is that with the collapse in confidence, banks are refusing to lend to one another and when the large amount of short-term bank or commercial debt which keeps the global business system going comes due for repayment or \"rolling over\" for another year, buyers are unwilling or unable to do so. </p> <p>This systemic unwillingness to lend is hitting almost all banks except the most strongly capitalised ones or those, like the Spanish ones, who have had strong regulatory limits on their lending. As the credit tide goes out, banks that over lent or lent on shaky assets are now becoming dangerously overexposed and potentially unable to meet their obligations. This is when government has to step in to prop them up or take them over. </p> <p>The credit crisis has also begun to have major impacts on the \"real economy\". Auto sales in the US were down dramatically in September, and the carmakers have asked the federal government for a $50bn assistance package. Arnold Schwarzenegger, California's governor, has also told the federal government that California may need <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/38105032-9165-11dd-b5cd-0000779fd18c,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/38105032-9165-11dd-b5cd-0000779fd18c.html&amp;_i_referer=http://www.ft.com/home/uk\"> an emergency $7bn loan</a> before the end of October. The state usually taps the credit markets at this time of year to raise money to tide it over until its tax revenues arrive in spring, but the markets have dried up. </p> <p>This may be one of the biggest requests, but it is unlikely to be the only one. Other US state and urban governments may also be in difficulties in raising enough money to pay their bills partly as a collapse of their housing markets, and the drying up of property tax revenues. </p> <p>In Britain, where a large proportion of local authority finance is supplied by central government and council tax, the problems are not as severe but the housing market is in dire straits and the mortgage lending figures for August were horrific. Net <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/sep/29/mortgages.property\">mortgage lending</a> fell to just \u00a3143m, down 95% on July. While this probably partly reflects buyers holding off to see whether government would reduce stamp duty, it also reflects a growing unwillingness to commit to purchases and a shortage of finance.</p> <p>With some <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/borrowing/mortgages/3129338/Financial-crisis-Nearly-600-mortgage-deals-are-scrapped-in-a-week.html\">mortgage lenders</a> having raised their rates again last week, the Nationwide withdrawing all mortgages for more than 90% of the valuation (which will hit a lot of first-time buyers) and the takeover of Bradford &amp; Bingley taking a large chunk of buy-to-let mortgages off the market, the housing market in Britain is set to get worst before it gets better. However much prices fall, a recovery is unlikely until such time as potential buyers are able to get mortgage finance again in sufficient quantities. But lenders are now fearful of lending on property that could fall beneath the value of the loan. </p> <p>We can only hope that the actions of the US and other governments will hold the dam against the flood of credit defaults. At present, we are seeing a row of dominoes falling and the ramifications will be widespread for the economy as well as the financial system.</p>",

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/alistairdarling\">Alistair Darling</a> today insisted that 98% of accounts held in British banks were \"fully covered\", as he confirmed that the government guarantee on savings would tomorrow be raised from \u00a335,000 to \u00a350,000.</p> <p>In a parliamentary statement, the chancellor said it was his responsibility to support a stable, well-functioning banking system, as he revealed that Northern Rock had now repaid half of the money it had been lent by taxpayers.</p> <p>\"Financial transactions are at the heart of everything we do. They allow people to buy goods, pay for services, buy homes, save for pensions and invest, so it's essential that we take action to both support the banking system as a whole as well as being ready to intervene in particular cases when it's necessary to do so,\" Darling told MPs. \"Both general support and individual intervention is necessary.\"</p> <p>Darling said that the government had made available in excess of \u00a3100bn of long-term funding and was \"willing to make further resources available as necessary\".</p> <p>The Bank of England had injected substantial funds into the markets and would continue to do so.</p> <p>\"Tomorrow it will put in another \u00a340bn,\" he said.</p> <p>Setting out what had been done in Britain to \"deal with developments in Europe over the weekend\", Darling said that from tomorrow the Financial Services Authority would raise the compensation limit for bank deposits from \u00a335,000 to \u00a350,000 - or \u00a3100,000 for joint accounts.</p> <p>\"This measure will ensure 98% of accounts are fully covered,\" he said. \"The FSA is consulting on whether to increase this limit further.\"</p> <p>The Treasury came under pressure last night to guarantee the savings of all depositors in British banks or face an exodus of cash from British financial institutions after Germany announced it was following the lead of the Irish and Greeks and offering a blanket guarantee on all savings.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordonbrown\">Gordon Brown</a> was due to speak to the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, today to clarify the extent of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/germany\">Germany</a>'s commitment to protect bank deposits, Downing Street said.</p> <p>British officials were said to be furious that Merkel had given no indication of the move at a summit in Paris on Saturday designed to coordinate a European response to the economic crisis.</p> <p>But moments before Darling got to his feet, EU leaders issued a joint statement vowing to take \"whatever measures are necessary to maintain the stability of the financial system\".</p> <p>\"All the leaders of the European Union make clear that each of them will take whatever measures are necessary to maintain the stability of the financial system \u2013 whether through liquidity support through central banks, action to deal with individual banks or enhanced depositor protection schemes,\" the statement said.</p> <p>\"While no depositors in our countries' banks have lost any money, we will continue to take the necessary measures to protect both the system and individual depositors. In taking these measures, European leaders acknowledge the need for close coordination and cooperation.\"</p> <p>Darling also told the Commons that Northern Rock \u2013 the first British bank taken into public ownership \u2013 had now repaid more than half of the taxpayers' money that had been lent to it.</p> <p>\"It continues to repay its loan ahead of schedule,\" Darling said.</p> <p>The chancellor said while it would be irresponsible to speculate on any future measures that may be needed to bring order to the financial system \"all practical options must remain open\".</p> <p>This morning Brown chaired the first of what will be twice-weekly meetings of his new national economic council, aimed at managing the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketturmoil\">economic crisis</a>. The meeting, which lasted about an hour, included an update from Hazel Blears, the communities secretary, on the impact of the crisis on the housing market.</p> <p>Brown has been involved in \"intense\" international discussions over the weekend about the financial crisis.</p> <p>Downing Street confirmed that in the past 24 hours Brown had held discussions with the prime ministers of Iceland and Denmark, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, the head of the European Central Bank and Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president.</p> <p>Asked whether the government had contingency plans to partially or completely nationalise the banking sector, Yvette Cooper, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said that Brown and Darling had promised to do \"whatever it takes\" to ensure the banking sector remained safe.</p> <p>\"The chancellor said yesterday that of course that does mean looking at a whole series of pretty big steps that you might not take in ordinary times,\" Cooper told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.</p> <p>In a significant shift in position, the Tory leader, David Cameron, said he favoured a recapitalisation to strengthen the banking system.</p> <p>\"It is something parties should talk about, and I think it is something where consensus would be better than opposition.\" Previously the Tories had spoken of ailing banks being taken over by the Bank of England to run them down and sell off their profitable assets.</p> <p>Darling has already allowed the bank to put \u00a340bn into the market this week to ease the problems of banks accessing money, but there are increasing signs that this is dealing merely with the symptoms of the problem.</p> <p>The chancellor also gave a broad hint that he feels the Bank of England is free to cut interest rates on Thursday when he said its remit was not confined to controlling inflation. \"The Bank of England also has a wider duty to support the government's economic objectives,\" he said.</p> <p>He did, however, reject calls from the Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman, Vincent Cable, to specifically change the bank's remit, saying such a move would undermine its independence. Cable had warned: \"We are in a real crisis situation. In an edge of the cliff environment.\"</p>",
  "<p>In recent years accounts from foreign banks have become a familiar fixture in UK best-buy tables. But now that the banking crisis has gone global, UK customers could be forgiven for wondering what would happen to their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/savings\">savings</a> if their savings provider were to fail.</p> <h2>Non-European banks</h2> <p>Non-European banks operating in the UK include <strong>ICICI Bank</strong>, one of India's largest financial institutions, <strong>Turkish Bank</strong>, and First Bank of Nigeria, which offers online savings accounts under the <strong>FirstSave</strong> brand. </p> <p>Any bank based outside the European Economic Area (EEA) that wants to set up shop in this country can only do so through a UK subsidiary directly authorised by the Financial Services Authority (FSA). \"This means that they come fully under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) and, as far as savers are concerned, are the same as a UK bank,\" said an FSA spokesperson.</p> <p>So if, for example, you've got an account with FirstSave, 100% of your money is protected up to the FSCS limit of \u00a350,000. The same applies if you have got money with ICICI Bank UK or Turkish Bank (UK), a subsidiary of Turkish Bank incorporated in Northern Cyprus.</p> <h2>European banks</h2> <p>A number of European banks offer savings accounts in the UK, including Dutch banks <strong>ING</strong> and <strong>Triodos</strong>, and <strong>Bank of Cyprus</strong>. Iceland is also part of the EEA, so accounts from Landsbanki, which runs the <strong>Icesave</strong> brand, and Kaupthing, which operates <strong>Kaupthing Edge</strong>, are also included in this category.</p> <p>The position of savers who have deposit accounts with the UK branches of banks incorporated in the EEA is not as straightforward as that for savers with non-EEA banks. </p> <p>EU rules make it compulsory for all countries in the EEA to have a compensation scheme in place which protects at least \u20ac20,000 of each eligible depositor's cash in the event of a bank failure. The problem is that many of these schemes stick to the minimum and are therefore less generous than our FSCS, France and Italy excepted. </p> <p>However, where a bank's home state scheme provides a lower limit of compensation than our UK scheme, the bank can choose to join the FSCS to \"top up\" the level of protection it offers. The good news is that most reputable European banks with a UK presence have done this. So if one of these banks went bust, its savers in the UK would be entitled to 100% of deposits up to \u00a350,000 with the compensation provided partly by the bank's home state scheme and topped up by FSCS.</p> <p>EEA banks that have topped up include ING Direct, Triodos, Bank of Cyprus and Landsbanki. For a complete list visit the <a href=\"http://www.fscs.org.uk/consumer/How_to_Claim/Deposits/EEA_firms_that_have_topped_up/\">FSCS website</a>. </p> <p>Kaupthing is authorised in the UK and qualifies for the FSA compensation scheme.</p> <p>If you've got money with the UK branch of an EEA bank whose home state has joined the growing number to announce 100% guarantees of all retail bank deposits (including Ireland, Germany, Greece and Denmark) your money is now protected wholly by that home state's scheme. Accounts from the <strong>Post Office</strong>, <strong>Allied Irish Bank</strong> and <strong>Anglo-Irish Bank</strong> are all covered by Ireland's guarantee. </p> <p>But should the worst happen and the bank in question become insolvent, you'll still be able to call on the FSCS for help with making a claim. A spokesperson said it would put UK savers in touch with the relevant home state schemes and help them through the process.</p> <p>A final word of warning: if you have a local account with an EEA bank - say you open an account with a Spanish bank in Spain because you own a property there - your money is protected solely by that bank's home state scheme with no FSCS top up available.</p> <h2>Case study: From best buys to big worries</h2> <p>Before the recent banking crisis Nick Stringer had not thought twice before putting substantially more than \u00a350,000 into two different saving accounts. He had made the money as a result of selling his company, but because he doesn't need it until he retires in two years he was quite happy to make a long-term investment. </p> <p>Aiming for the best return he could get, he put one lot of money in a one-year fixed-rate account with FirstSave and the same amount with Icelandic bank IceSave. Both banks offer higher interest rates to those savers who agree to leave their money in the account for a year, with no access to it during that time.</p> <p>But now Nick is worried. \"Before the current crisis it never occurred to me that there was even the smallest risk in doing this, but now I realise there is,\" he says. \"However, even if I wanted to do something about it and transfer my money somewhere else I can't, because under the terms and conditions of the deposit I cannot make withdrawals for a year.\"</p> <p>Nick says he is \"reasonably confident\" both banks will turn out to be OK but he is aggrieved that the government protection for deposits doesn't cover those who have unwittingly tied up more than \u00a350,000 in a fixed-term account.</p> <p>\"In the current uncertainty, I can't see anyone wanting to invest more than \u00a350,000 in one of these accounts,\" he says. \"The only thing that would encourage them is if the government either guarantees the security or I get the right to cancel, subject of course to cancellation penalties which I would accept.\"<br><strong>Lisa Bachelor</strong></p>",
  "<p>US administrations typically suffer temporary loss of international influence as their time in office draws to a close. But rarely has Washington's global prestige and leverage fallen so low as in the dog days of George Bush's eight-year reign. </p> <p>This debilitation is a source of concern for America's friends - and a dangerous opportunity for its enemies, who hope such weakness can be both exploited and made permanent.</p> <p>The US-triggered economic crisis has reinforced hostile perceptions of American vulnerability. Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, recently gleefully invited his countrymen to listen to the sound of a global power crashing to the ground. Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri, senior adviser to the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, told a prayer meeting that Bush's reported refusal to back an Israeli military strike on Iran was another sign of failing American will.</p> <p>Nateq-Nuri claimed Washington's \"retreat\" showed that overall US and European support for Israel was diminishing. \"It seems that Israel is approaching its expiry date and is no longer of any use to the west - and that the west is trying to collaborate in a plot to expose Israel to destruction.\"</p> <p>Seen from Washington, this interpretation of events looks patently absurd. Yet at the same time, the fact that a highly placed regime figure in Tehran apparently believes a future attempt to destroy Israel would meet with reduced resistance from the western powers is deeply worrying.</p> <p>Vladimir Putin is aggressively exploiting Bush's lame duck troubles in his bid to reassert Moscow's great power status. Analysts suggest Russia's invasion of Georgia in August was based in part on calculations, vindicated by ensuing events, that Bush would be unwilling or unable to react forcefully.</p> <p>Now Russia's prime minister appears to be threatening Ukraine, accusing its president, Viktor Yushchenko, of sending weapons and military personnel to help Georgia. \"When people and military systems are used to kill Russian soldiers, it's a crime,\" he said last week. </p> <p>The US Republican presidential candidate, John McCain, is warning that Putin is encouraging the ethnic Russian population of Ukraine's Crimea region, where Russia's Black Sea fleet is based, to break with Kiev. But at present, the US is mostly a spectator.</p> <p>Russia's president, Dmitri Medvedev, is meanwhile busily rubbing American noses in the financial dirt - and pointing to long-term strategic consequences of the crisis. \"The times when one economy and one country dominated are gone for good,\" Medvedev said. </p> <p>To American ears, his words uncomfortably echoe Germany's finance minister, Peer Steinbrueck, an ostensible ally, who predicted \"the US will lose its superpower status in the world financial system\". Americans have been reminded that Schadenfreude is, after all, a German word.</p> <p>Some countries are seeking shorter-term advantage from America's troubles. North Korea may be counting on a new, possibly Democratic administration to gain a more favourable nuclear disarmament deal. Similar considerations by interested parties have helped freeze the Middle East peace process.</p> <p>But uncertainty over America's \u2014 and its allies' \u2014 will to win in Afghanistan (fuelled in recent days by British commanders and diplomats), and over how quickly the US will get out of Iraq, is affecting longer-term political calculations in Islamabad, Kabul and Baghdad. </p> <p>It may be encouraging the Taliban and al-Qaida in their escalating campaigns of violence. They read the newspapers and the internet too. And with America's purse strings already tightly stretched, they must wonder, along with many US voters, whether a new administration can afford the additional tens of billions of dollars needed to pursue two unpopular wars.</p> <p>In America's backyard, ideological enemies such as Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, the Venezuelan president, are hoping for a permanent shift in power in a region historically dominated by the US. \"The world will never be the same after this crisis,\" Ch\u00e1vez said during a visit to Brazil. \"A new world order has to emerge and it is a multipolar world. We are decoupling from the wagon of death.\" </p> <p>His host, the Brazilian president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, complained bitterly that Washington spent years telling Latin America how to get its economic house in order - and then ignored its own advice.</p> <p>Despite all the weaknesses, short-term and strategic, it would be foolish to start writing obituaries for American power. According to the Bosnian war peacemaker Richard Holbrooke, writing in Foreign Affairs, \"the next president will inherit a more difficult opening-day set of international problems than any of his predecessors since at least the end of the second world war\".</p> <p>But Holbrooke, tipped as a possible secretary of state in an Obama administration, warned that current problems should be kept in perspective and suggested America's ambition remained undiminished. The next president, he said, would inherit \"a nation that is still the most powerful in the world - a nation rich with the continued promise of its dynamic and increasingly diverse population, a nation that could, and must again, inspire, mobilise and lead the world\".</p>",
  "<p>Over the past 10 years, targets for cuts in CO2 emissions have crept up. Take the UK. Kyoto required a 12.5% reduction from 1990 levels by 2012, some of which we'd already achieved when we ratified the agreement. Next, the government promised a 20% reduction by the same date. That developed into a 60% cut by 2050, which the government has now accepted may need to become an 80% reduction.</p> <p>George Monbiot and others <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2007/dec/04/comment.politics\">have gone further</a>, calling for a cut of more than 90% by 2050 to reflect the latest science and to allow for equal distribution of the right to pollute around the world.</p> <p>Many think that targets such as these sound hopelessly ambitious, but <a href=\"http://www.sei.se/editable/pages/news/Sweden%20GDRs%20Final.pdf\">a new report</a> (pdf) from the <a href=\"http://www.sei.se/index.php\">Stockholm Environment Institute</a> goes further still. It claims that for many developed countries a useful and just target will be a reduction of more than 100% \u2013 and in just over a decade. The report takes Sweden as a case study and concludes that its goal should be a drop in emissions of 122% by 2020.</p> <p>Hold on a minute, I hear you cry, how can a country reduce its emissions by more than it produces?</p> <p>The answer to that seeming paradox, of course, is to pay for emissions reductions abroad. But why should Sweden and other similar countries have to do that? Surely reducing its own emissions to zero \u2013 or nearly zero \u2013 would be enough?</p> <p>Not according to the new report, which is based on an approach called <a href=\"http://www.ecoequity.org/GDRs/\">Greenhouse Development Rights</a>. This idea has been around a year or so, but hasn't often made the headlines. The new report is an interesting example of seeing how it might actually work in practice. It's all a bit complex, so bear with me here.</p> <p>The approach is based on the idea that the developing world will, justifiably, never \"prioritise rapid emissions reductions above its goal of human development for its people. Any strategy that even implicitly attempts to force such a prioritisation will be futile.\"</p> <p>The way around this potential roadblock, the report suggests, is to work out the true responsibility of each country \u2013 ie its emissions \u2013 as well as its true capacity to contribute to the solution.</p> <p>To work out the responsibility, you look at imports and exports to work out the true carbon footprint of each country. If an individual in the West purchases something \u2013 be it a phone made in China or a bean grown in Kenya \u2013 the emissions are allocated to your country, not the country that produced it. In the case of Sweden \u2013 which, like most rich countries, imports far more than it exports \u2013 this adds around a fifth to its official emissions figures.</p> <p>How about capacity? The idea here is to set an income threshold \u2013 the report plumps for $20 per person per day \u2013 above which a responsibility for paying for climate change kicks in. It's a bit like how income tax works: you don't pay anything until you earn a fixed annual minimum.</p> <p>Finally, you work out the total required cut in global emissions reductions and divvy it up nation-by-nation according to responsibility and capacity. In the case of Sweden, the report calculates that it should make (or pay for) 0.51% of the world's total emissions savings, which equates to 122% of its current emissions. This ambitious target, the report estimates, would cost the average Swedish citizen around $1.20 per day.</p> <p>For comparison, the US would need to make or pay for 33% of the world's emissions saving, the EU 26%, Japan 7.8%, China 5.5% and India 0.5%. But over time, as emissions and income patterns shift, so do the targets. If a country gets greener, its responsibility drops. If it gets richer, it will be asked to do more.</p> <p>All of which is rather neat. I'm going to ponder this idea more (the report doesn't make for easy Monday-morning reading), but my initial reaction to the GDR concept is positive \u2013 something worth serious consideration alongside competing schemes such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraction_and_Convergence\">Contraction &amp; Convergence</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/jul/01/climatechange.carbonemissions\">Kyoto2</a>.</p> <p>Unfortunately, as with all such schemes, it's hard to imagine today's world signing up. Sweden? Perhaps. The US? Perhaps not. The American politicians who have recently been describing the financial bail-out as the first step on the slippery path to socialism would doubtless make parallels between the GDR approach and that old Marxist maxim: from each according to his ability, to each according to his need.</p> <p>The report acknowledges that its proposal would be hard for many nations to swallow, with targets \"large enough to seem implausible by today's standards of political realism.\" But it implores Sweden to take a do the right thing by the climate and the world's poor by committing to its 122% carbon cut in the run-up to the Copenhagen summit.</p> <p>We'll have to wait and see if it happens. It seems a long shot to me, but we can take some comfort from the fact that a handful of Western governments \u2013 such as Sweden's \u2013 may at least seriously consider such targets. Thanks be for Scandinavia.</p>",
  "<p>A Hells Angels biker was shot dead on the M40 motorway in a \"military-style operation\" by members of the rival Outlaws gang, the murder trial of six men heard today.</p> <p>Karl Garside, 45, Simon Turner, 41, Dane Garside, 42, Malcolm Bull, 53, Dean Taylor, 47 and Ian Cameron, 46, have pleaded not guilty to murdering Gerard Tobin near Leamington Spa in August last year.</p> <p>Tobin, 35, a mechanic from Mottingham, south-east London, was shot dead with a single bullet to the back of the head as he rode a Harley-Davidson motorcycle back from an annual four-day biker festival called the Bulldog Bash at an airfield in Warwickshire.</p> <p>It is alleged the suspects followed in him a car at up to 90mph. The car was found burnt out later that day and did not provide any forensic evidence.</p> <p>Timothy Raggatt QC, for the prosecution, told Birmingham crown court that Tobin's murder was a \"thoroughly cold-blooded business\" carried out \"with great skill and precision, great timing and was the product of a great deal of planning\".</p> <p>The prosecution said there was no evidence to suggest the six men knew Tobin, but he had been targeted as a \"fully patched\" senior member of the Hells Angels.</p> <p>The six men were members of the south Warwickshire chapter of the Outlaws, the main rivals to the Hells Angels, Raggatt said. He told the jury of six men and six women: \"This wasn't a case of a man being killed for any personal motive or any personal reason. This was a man who was targeted not because of who he was, but because of what he was. In one sense, Gerry Tobin was a random victim.</p> <p>\"There were contingencies and alternatives that had been planned for. It was in that sense almost a military-style operation and had at its heart the plain intention to kill.</p> <p>\"The evidence may show us that Long Marston [the site of the Bulldog Bash] is in a part of the country that the Outlaws regard as theirs - part of their patch.\"</p> <p>A seventh man, Sean Creighton, 44, from Coventry, pleaded guilty to murder and two firearms charges at a hearing last week. He will be sentenced at the end of the trial, which is expected to last six weeks. He had previously denied the charge.</p> <p>More than 100 bikers attended court last week to hear Creighton's plea. The crowd included members of the Outlaws.</p> <p>CCTV footage was released showing Tobin at a petrol station minutes before he was killed.</p> <p>Thousands of bikers escorted his funeral procession last September from the Hells Angels' clubhouse in Bethnal Green, east London.</p> <p>The six on trial are also charged with possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life.</p> <p>Rebecca Smith, Tobin's girlfriend for five years, said in a statement at the time of his killing: \"Gerry was a thinking man, always ready and able to offer guidance and support to others, a true inspiration to many people, a charming personality whose quick-witted humour always kept everyone smiling.<br>\"The nature of his untimely death due to a callous and cowardly act of violence from which it was impossible to defend himself, only accentuates further the pain and suffering that we are all experiencing due to this terrible loss.\"</p> <p>The six on trial were arrested in dawn raids by police. The trial continues.</p>",
  "<p>Online auction house <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/ebay\">eBay</a> is axing 1,000 jobs or 10% of its global workforce as it looks to save $150m (\u00a385m) a year in the face of slowing sales, in the latest evidence that gloom in the world economy is starting to impact major dotcom companies.</p> <p>But the company also shocked Wall Street by announcing it is spending $1.3bn on acquisitions, including $820m in cash on internet payments company Bill Me Later, which lets American shoppers make purchases online without having a credit card, to bolster its PayPal payments operation.</p> <p>It is also buying Danish online classifieds site <a href=\"http://www.dba.dk/\">dba.dk</a> and vehicles website <a href=\"http://www.bilbasen.dk/\">bilbasen.dk</a> for approximately $390m, also in cash.</p> <p>The auction house's chief executive, John Donahoe, admitted: \"To some it may seem a counter-intuitive to be making these deals but we believe it is an appropriate time to bring these companies into our portfolio.\"</p> <p>He stressed that eBay's financials are strong and the current turmoil in the market will make \"the strong stronger\", but admitted \"the economy and the strong dollar are impacting our business\".</p> <p>The company will announce its third-quarter results next week but eBay said today that it expects to hit the low end of its revenue guidance, although its profits per share will be better than expected. The job losses will result in a $70m to $80m restructuring charge which the company will take in its fourth quarter.</p> <p>Bill Me Later has deals with over 1,000 retailers who use it on their websites or in their phone sales departments. It has more than 4 million signed up users who can buy from these retailers. They then receive a monthly bill which they can pay by cheque, money order or another bill pay system, but not a credit card.</p> <p>Retailers, however, can use it to offer interest-free credit and buy now, pay later offerings which are likely to be extremely popular at a time when America's banking industry is in crisis. </p> <p>On a call with analysts the eBay and PayPal management team stressed the expertise within Bill Me Later, which was set up just 8 years ago, but analysts have concerns that the deal will leave eBay even more exposed to the worsening US economy.</p> <p>As one Wall Street analyst asked on the conference call: \"Who's on the hook if the consumer cannot pay for that flat-screen TV?\"</p> <p>The resounding answer that came back was \"Bill Me Later.\"</p>",
  "<p>Looking far more businesslike than in his rather frayed television interview <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00dx462/\">yesterday</a>, Mayor Johnson opened the first meeting of the Metropolitan Police Authority under his long-awaited chairmanship by noting that it is no coincidence that visitors to London purchase large numbers of imitation police helmets, these being as emblematic of the city's proud traditions as red buses. He went on to declare that, \"the strongest and most civilised societies are those where the police and citizens are close.\" He quoted the <a href=\"http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/England-History/SirRobertPeel.htm\">creator of the Peelers</a>: \"The police are the public and the public are the police.\" This prepared the ground for the damage limitation to come. </p> <p>Johnson knew that the non-Tories in the chamber were cross with him. He had, after all, precipitated Sir Ian Blair's departure without formally consulting the Authority \u2013 as <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7107631.stm\">precedent, arguably, required</a> \u2013 and despite consistently saying that he had \"consulted widely,\" a later show of hands niftily called for by the Green Party's Jenny Jones revealed that this width had encompassed rather few of those present. </p> <p>The mayor was at pains to shoot foxes and to reassure: he renewed his <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/view_press_release.jsp?releaseid=19067\">tribute</a> to Blair, maintaining that his suggestion that the latter should resign was prompted purely by the many distractions the now ex-Commissioner was facing and not the result of ruthless Tory plotting; in marked \u2013 perhaps shameless - contrast with his pronouncements in the election campaign, he asserted that crime is falling because \"the figures tell us so,\" but that the public still needs convincing; in his latest capitulation to the namby-pamby, politically correct, hand-wringing liberal claptrap that's brought this country to its knees (etcetera, etcetera) he's had such fun ridiculing over the years, he made clear that \"the police must resemble the community they serve.\" </p> <p>He also pledged to work \"hand in glove\" with all members of the MPA, though several will only believe it when they see it. His appointment of independent member Cindy Butts to lead an inquiry into race and faith discrimination within the Met was criticised as yet another bit of unilateral action, notwithstanding great confidence expressed in Butts herself. And shouldn't the inquiry be fully independent of the MPA asked Labour's Len Duvall, the body's previous chair, if it was to be seen as credible by all Londoners? This brought applause from the gallery. One of those clapping was Lee Jasper, Ken Livingstone's former adviser on policing and equality issues. </p> <p>A more oblique intervention came from the Lib Dems' Dee Doocey. She asked for a reassurance that the process of finding a permanent successor to Ian Blair would begin without delay. Call me nasty and suspicious but I can't help wondering if her request was inspired by those stories of Boris and his deputy for policing Kit Malthouse being in no rush to find a permanent replacement because they're hoping that a nice, friendly Tory home secretary will, like a New Routemaster bus, be along soon. </p> <p>Mayor Johnson dealt with this and the more overt criticisms with his familiar mannerly guile. He voted in favour of the following motion from Jones:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We believe that decisions concerning the confidence of Londoners in their Commissioner need to be taken by the Metropolitan Police Authority, with its cross party and independent membership, reflecting a broad range of Londoners views.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>He asked Malthouse to kindly take on board all those helpful suggestions and sincere concerns, and to review the terms of reference of Butts' inquiry (\"We all agree,\" he decided, with smooth diplomatic vagueness, \"that there must be a large independent element\"). He described the chances of a repeat of the Ian Blair drama as \"extremely, vanishingly remote,\" words that will be remembered with particular clarity by the man sitting two seats to his right \u2013 Deputy Commissioner <a href=\"http://press.homeoffice.gov.uk/press-releases/Appointment_Of_Paul_Stephenson_A?version=1\">Sir Paul Stephenson</a>, who was filling in for Blair and is thought a contender to succeed him. It was now time for Sir Paul to deliver his report on operational matters. Mayor Johnson had received a caution.

  "<p>The world needs an international agreement like the Kyoto protocol to reduce levels of ozone pollution which harm human health and crop yields, according to a report from senior scientists.</p> <p>In a report from the <a href=\"http://royalsociety.org/\">Royal Society</a>, the scientists said that current regulatory approaches were failing and that the problem needed to be tackled at a UN level. Prof David Fowler who chaired the working group who produced the report said it was \"a major international issue\". </p> <p>\"The only way we are going to really solve the problem in the longer term is by having international strategies because it is a global pollutant,\" he said. \"If we don't take action now it could be a really serious problem.\"</p> <p>Ozone forms in the air from chemical reactions involving pollutants such as oxides of nitrogen (collectively known as NOX) and volatile organic compounds such as benzene. These are released when fossil fuels are burned in cars or power stations. The problem of ozone pollution at ground level is a separate from the issue of ozone holes in the atmosphere.</p> <p>Ozone is particularly dangerous for older people and people with asthma because it affects the lungs, nose and eyes. In 2003, an estimated 1,582 people died in the UK because of ozone exposure and this number is projected to rise 51% by 2020. Ozone can also reduce the yield and affect the nutritional quality of crops including wheat, rice and soybean. In the EU an estimated \u20ac6.7 bn was lost in 2000 due to impacts on arable crops. Ozone is also a greenhouse gas.</p> <p>Fowler said that the US and Europe had made great strides in reducing levels of the pollutants that lead to ozone production, but he said more needed to be done and other sources \u2013 such as developing economies and shipping \u2013 sould to be tackled. \"Europe and North America have each tried to solve their ozone problem as a local problem,\" said Fowler, \"but most of the ozone coming into Britain is coming from everywhere else on the planet.\"</p> <p>He said that controls on pollution from international shipping are too lax. By 2020, he said that more NOX is projected to enter Europe from burning fuel in ships' engines than from all land-based sources combined.</p> <p>\"The crucial thing is to have a control strategy that brings everyone into the same family,\" he said, \"There's time to do it and it is all doable and it is not a global disaster, but if you leave it the cost later will be very much greater, both in terms of human health and crops.\"</p>",

  "<p>Nearly a quarter of the world's land mammal species are at risk of extinction, and many others may vanish before they are even known to science, according to a major annual survey of global wildlife.</p> <p>At least 1,141 of the 5,487 known species of mammal are threatened, with 188 listed in the highest risk \"critically endangered\" category. One in three marine mammals are also threatened, according to the five year review. </p> <p>The \"red list\" assessment, conducted by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), involved more than 1,700 experts in 130 countries, and confirms the devastating impact of forest clearing, hunting, fisheries, pollution and climate change on the populations and ranges of the world's most studied class of animals.</p> <p>Jan Schipper, the director of the global mammals assessment, a partnership between Conservation International and the IUCN, called for countries to be held responsible for the fate of fauna within their borders and the establishment of an international coalition to save species that cross national boundaries.</p> <p>\"We're looking at a 25% decline over the long term, yet for mammals there is no bail out plan. There is no long term conservation strategy that is going to prevent species extinction in the future,\" he said.</p> <p>\"As human beings, we should be ensuring that we don't cause other species to go extinct.\"</p> <p>Disturbingly, the figures are likely to be a conservative estimate, because scientists have insufficient data on 836 species to even classify how threatened they are. If these are all at risk, it would mean 36% of the world's mammal species are in danger of becoming extinct.</p> <p>Among the critically endangered species is the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus), with only 84 to 143 adults remaining. Experts believe 29 others may already have become extinct, including the Baiji or Yangtze river dolphin, and the little Earth hutia, a small rodent endemic to islands off Cuba, which has not been seen in nearly 40 years. Two species, the Scimitar-horned oryx and P\u00e8re David's deer are extinct in the wild, and only live on in captivity.</p> <p>Many species, such as the grey wolf and brown bear, have experienced substantial population declines and seen their ranges contract as their natural habitats have been destroyed. More than half of the world's mammal species for which trends are known are in decline, the report found.</p> <p>\"We are getting far too used to seeing these reports bemoaning the fate of the planet or the decline of animals. I am really concerned that we have become deadened to this sort of depressing information and now simply ignore it without stopping to think about the implications,\" said Mark Wright, chief scientist at WWF. </p> <p>\"The IUCN report shows that, with our ill-considered management of the Earth and its resources, we are threatening the future of wildlife and nature and denying our children the chance to experience what we have experienced.\"</p> <p>The survey, which is published by the journal Science today, identifies extinction hotspots where vast numbers of species are under threat. Typically, these are regions with a rich diversity of species that all face a similar threat to their environment. </p> <p>Threatened land mammals are concentrated in south and south-east Asia. There, a staggering 79% of monkeys and apes face extinction. Other hotspots include the tropical Andes, the Cameroonian highlands, the Albertine rift and the Western Ghats in India.</p> <p>\"Often, there is habitat loss from deforestation, either for farming or timber, and that leaves the animals living on small patches of land. Then, on top of that, you have hunting, with an enormous number of people who are entirely reliant on natural resources to feed themselves. That has really set up a perfect storm over south-east Asia,\" said Schipper.</p> <p>The greatest threats to marine mammals are being caught in fishing nets or being struck by shipping vessels, although for the Yangtze river dolphin, pollution is a major contributor. </p> <p>Climate change is already having an impact on amphibians and plant life, but it is expected to put increasing pressure on mammals too, either by destroying their environment, such as the Arctic ice sheets that are home to polar bears, or by forcing their prey elsewhere.</p> <p>Among the most threatened mammals are those only recently discovered. Since 1992, 349 new mammal species have been identified, but 51% of these face extinction, compared with 23% of species known prior to 1992. \"Species may be vanishing even before they are known to science,\" the scientists write in the journal.</p> <p>There is a glimmer of hope among the bleak assessment. At least 5% of the currently threatened species now have stable or rising populations, many of which are the focus of huge conservation efforts. Populations of the European bison and black-footed ferret are both recovering. </p> <p>\"The problem we face is that without the political and public will to spend money on species conservation we are pressed up against the wall,\" said Schipper. \"By making this data public, we're hoping it'll reach the people who make decisions about where money is spent.\"</p>",
  "<p>If a week is a long time in politics, 12 months is surely an eternity. A year ago Brown still bounced. Cameron was having to make the speech of his life to save his skin, facing what looked like an imminent general election likely to conclude in the Tories' fourth successive defeat. Today consistent Conservative poll leads have led many to write off Labour's chances for 2010 and view Cameron as a prime minister in waiting. And Comment is free is collecting blogs that address the question \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/series/whoownstheprogressivefuture\">Is the Future Conservative</a>\"?<br> If we're looking at one-word answers surely the reply must be a resounding \"no\". Admittedly now that it looks like they have a prospect of power, there seems to be more interest in Tory ideas than at any time since their long spell in opposition began. Labour thinktanks such as the IPPR have been selling their wares to the other side and veteran radical-left publishers Lawrence and Wishart, whose biggest grossing titles are Marx in the original, have just published a zeitgeisty e-book on <a href=\"http://www.lwbooks.co.uk/conservative.pdf\">new Conservative thinking (pdf)</a>. Yet if you put aside the admiration expressed for Thatcher to the Tory faithful by Cameron at their conference and consider what those ideas actually are emerging from his green papers, the answer is that there's nothing much that'd be out of place in the New Labour bible. For the time being the future consists of the Conservative party aping of New Labour. The postwar Butskellite consensus has been replaced by a post cold war/Berlin Wall/Thatcher consensus that Cameron and Brown both labour under.</p> <p>The few policies that have been unveiled in the past week are a confused ragbag. Wanting more regulation in the financial sector and rushing to Gordon Brown's side to fight the fires of global capitalism in crisis contradicts earlier positions the Conservatives have taken. Populism must inform Tory support for have-a-go-heroes (homeowners who kill burglars) and freezing council tax. But announcing an expansion of academy schools is surely an attempt to out-New Labour New Labour, in the same way that the \"tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime\" soundbite once whipped the law and order rug from under the Tories feet. The Conservatives' ostentatious halting of plans for a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/29/toryconference.transport\">third runway at Heathrow</a> last week is ostensibly a radical green solution but its chief inspiration was the arc of marginal commuterbelt seats in the shadow of the flightpath. </p> <p>Elsewhere a rightwing moralism dictates the tax breaks for married couples that JK Rowling tore into when dispatching her million quid to Labour. Step back, though, and in terms of broader rhetoric there is bigger picture talk of \"corporate social responsibility\" and sticking to Labour's spending pledges. Substitute in the name of economist Richard Thayler (pioneer of the theory of \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/jul/12/economy.conservatives1\">nudge theory</a>\") for Anthony Giddens or Will Hutton (Remember the \"third way\" and the \"state we're in\"?) and it all could all bring on an odd sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu for anyone old enough to remember or care. </p> <p>For the moment the Tories are too timid to upset New Labour's thrice election-winning formula of public service investment with an acceptance of the framework of market economics. Hence we are solemnly warned there will be no Tory tax cuts. Indeed he 10p debacle shows how pass\u00e9 slashing taxes is. Even while the majority were 2p in the pound better off, widespread outrage caused a government climbdown that couldn't save the Crewe and Nantwich seat. Amid Cameron's Thatcher namedropping the BBC counted the use of the word \"society\" 23 times in his main conference speech \u2013 something Lady T famously thought there was no such thing as.</p> <p>David Cameron's self-portrayal as blokey Smiths fan who suns it on the beach in Cornwall with his young family while preferring exclusive foreign <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2008/08/23/exclusive-lavish-holiday-exposes-the-lie-of-ordinary-guy-david-cameron-115875-20708731/\">hols on the sly</a> is living proof of the success of New Labour: a plastic Blair.

When I interviewed amiable Dagenham backbencher <a href=\"http://www.labourhome.org/story/2007/11/20/84423/521\">Jon Cruddas</a> he called all this \"cross-dressing\" and commented: \"It's almost physiologically they're all merging into one.\" All around us the evidence is there: it is New Labour who has won the battle of ideas and the Conservatives who have surrendered to the dictum that \"if you can't beat 'em join 'em\" or rather, ape them. In the 18 months that remain until the next election the Labour party must convince the British public of the hollowness of Cameron's con trick.</p> <p><em>Is the future Conservative?, a debate by Comment is free and Soundings magazine, will take place in London at Kings Place on October 6 at 7pm.

  "<p>Sales of new cars crashed last month as cash-strapped consumers continued to cut back on non-essential purchases in the economic slowdown.</p> <p>Figures released this morning by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) showed that sales of cars slumped by more than 20% in September compared with a year ago.</p> <p>This follows a similar <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/05/automotive.creditcrunch\">sharp fall in August</a> and means car sales for this year are down 7.5% - or over 120,000 vehicles. </p> <p>The SMMT's data shows the credit crunch and wider economic slowdown is having a damaging effect on the UK car market, with production being cut back and a car parts firm falling into administration today with the loss of 600 jobs.</p> <p>Sales of some luxury models plunged, with purchases of Bentleys down by 48% - at 153 versus 293 a year ago \u2013 and Land Rover sales almost halving to 4,907 from 9,756.</p> <p>This is the fifth month in which new car sales have fallen, and the SMMT called for immediate help from the government.</p> <p>\"The chancellor's pre-budget report should set out a package of measures to boost demand for new fuel-efficient cars and scrap plans for unfair increases in car tax,\" said Paul Everitt, SMMT chief executive.</p> <p>September is an important month for car dealers, following the launch of new registration plates in August. But only 330,295 new car registrations were recorded during the month \u2013 21.2% fewer than September 2007.</p> <p>Several car factories have cut production to cope with the downturn, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2008/oct/01/manufacturing.manufacturingdata\">workers at Ford's plant in Southampton starting a four-day week this month</a>, although their pay is not affected.</p> <p>In Sheffield, around 600 workers at a car parts supplier were made redundant today after the firm was put into administration less than a week after being taken over.

  "<p>By the end of the Green Bay Packers' 27-24 defeat to the Atlanta Falcons at Lambeau Field yesterday, a game played in glorious autumn sunshine, both franchises had a better understanding of how their respective long-term replacements for departed star quarterbacks can perform.</p> <p>Brett Favre and Michael Vick both left in unsatisfactory circumstances. Favre, the triple MVP superstar with a record unbroken 257-game starting streak for the Packers, a Super Bowl ring and a steak house near Lambeau which was serving succulent 32-ounce porterhouse steaks last night, had a very public and embarrassing fall-out with the Packers.</p> <p>\"We wanted Brett to stay,\" the Packers president Mark Murphy told me during the half-time break at Lambeau yesterday. But Favre did not stay. Having retired last season, he changed his mind and \"unretired\". But no agreement could be reached between Favre and the general manager Ted Thompson and the head coach Mike McCarthy.</p> <p>He was not allowed to move to the NFC divisional rivals Chicago Bears or Minnesota Vikings \u2013 his preference \u2013 by the Packers. So he settled for the AFC and the mediocre New York Jets, where he threw a career-best six touchdowns last week. \"The whole thing was a PR disaster, a nightmare,\" said one Packer insider of an episode that has given the 24-year-old Aaron Rodgers his chance after three years warming the bench at Green Bay.</p> <p>Vick, meanwhile, a 28-year-old Pro Bowl quarterback with a record-breaking running game, is serving a 23-month prison sentence for dog fighting. His 50-odd pitbulls were found to have been chained to car axles and shot, hanged, electrocuted or drowned if they refused to fight. After last season's indecision in Atlanta over filling the quarterback position, Vick was finally replaced by the rookie Matt Ryan, who signed on for a $72m contract, making him the NFL's fourth-highest earner before he even started a game.</p> <p>So how did the quarterbacks perform? Each were patchy, and during the closing quarter each made a significant mistake in front of the 70,616 crowd \u2013 the 272nd consecutive sell-out at Lambeau. Ryan's error let the Packers back in when his team were leading 17-10 with less than 13 minutes remaining. The tight end Ben Hartstock was wide open in the end zone but Ryan threw weakly into the grateful arms of Tramon Williams for an interception. From that possession Rodgers needed only four plays to take his team the 80 yards into the Falcons' endzone.</p> <p>This levelled the score but, after the Falcons managed an instant reply through a 41-yard field goal from Jason Elam, Rodgers, who had been an injury doubt because of a suspect shoulder, made what proved the fatal mistake. His intended pass for the wide receiver Ruvell Martin was grabbed by the linebacker Michael Boley.</p> <p>That, effectively, was game over, leaving the Packers with a 2-3 record, the reverse of Atlanta's. And while the Falcons head coach Mike Smith rated Ryan as \"calm, cool and collected \u2013 he performed extremely well,'\" McCarthy said of Rodgers: \"He definitely was affected [by his shoulder injury]. But he did a great job managing the game and he was smart with the football today.\" The head coach did, though, hint at the quarterback's errors. \"We're making common mistakes,\" he said. \"Our house is messy right now. We've got to clean up.\"</p> <p>Now the team whose fans like to say they hail from Title Town \u2013 because of the Packers' record 12 championships \u2013 and were an overtime field goal away from the 2008 Super Bowl, have already lost as many games as all of the last regular season. \"We're 2-3 right now,\" McCarthy admitted. \"If I knew the answer, I'd be a rich man. I'm not happy with the way it's going.\"</p> <p>The Packers faithful did not look too cheery either as they headed into the fresh Wisconsin afternoon for beer, burgers and bratwurst in the bars around Lambeau Field.</p> <h2>Three and out</h2> <p>\u2022 Tipped pre-season to be the AFC whipping boys again, the Miami Dolphins earned their second notable scalp when they beat the San Diego Chargers 17-10 at Dolphin Stadium, restricting the Chargers' offence to just 202 yards. The Dolphins beat the New England Patriots in week three and have now beaten both participants in last year's AFC Championship game, improving to 2-2 on the season.</p> <p>\u2022 The Washington Redskins overcame a 14-0 first-quarter deficit at Philadelphia to inflict the Eagles' third loss of the season and leave them bottom of the NFC East. The Redskins are now 4-1 under their new coach Jim Zorn after Clinton Portis ran for 145 yards and one touchdown against the league's best run defense.</p> <p>\u2022 The Tennessee Titans and the New York Giants have the last two 100% records in the league after the Buffalo Bills were thrashed 41-17 by the Arizona Cardinals. The Bills quarterback Trent Edwards suffered concussion in a clash of helmets with the Cardinals safety Adrian Wilson in the first quarter and although his replacement J.P. Losman threw an 87-yard touchdown pass to Lee Evans \u2013 the fifth longest in the franchise history \u2013 he was also sacked five times. The Titans, meanwhile, beat Baltimore 13-10 and the Giants crushed Seattle 44-6.</p>",
  "<p>A senior brigadier's candour about the prospects of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/05/afghanistan\"> beating the Taliban</a> in Afghanistan must have given the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/03/johnhutton.gordonbrown\">new defence secretary</a> John Hutton a bit of jolt just days into his new job. But he should welcome the remarks of <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article4887927.ece\">Brigadier Mark Carleton-Smith</a> about British strategy as a cue for a reality check.</p> <p>It isn't the only urgent problem in the new minister's in-tray. In fact, it is one of several that will need addressing sooner rather than later \u2013 and by that I mean in the next few weeks. It isn't that his predecessor, Des Browne, didn't care. He is said to have been privately anguished by the level of deaths and injuries of British servicemen and women in a conflict in which they have been involved over a longer period than the second world war.</p> <p>The problem is that both Browne and his prime minister avoided public pronouncements about the aim of British strategy in Iraq and Afghanistan, what it might realistically achieve and when the troops could come home.</p> <p>The problems now facing Hutton are that British forces and their equipment are facing exhaustion after five-and-a-half years in Iraq and seven in Afghanistan. Though most of the troops will come out of Iraq next summer, they will do so with little sense of success and with the opprobrium of the Americans, the ally whose cause took them there in the first place.</p> <p>The British division will pull out of Basra by midsummer, to be replaced by a US divisional command. In theory this should save between \u00a3500m and \u00a3750m from the UK budget. But it probably won't. Replacing their kit, training and redeployment \u2013 most likely to Afghanistan \u2013 will eat up a large slice of that saving.</p> <p>In Afghanistan the dilemma is different, more dangerous and complex. There are now signs of a serious difference in approach between Britain and America. Increasingly the international effort in Afghanistan is becoming an all-American run show. The American commander <a href=\"http://www.nationalpost.com/news/world/story.html?id=859844\">General David McKiernan</a> commands the international support and assistance force to the Karzai government (Isaf) as well as commanding the US operation enduring freedom against al-Qaida and its allies in George W Bush's global \"war on terror\" (GWOT). He is running a split command, and different missions.</p> <p>\"Increasingly the allies, even the ones doing the fighting like the Canadians, Dutch, Danes and Brits are becoming bit players \u2013 a sideshow,\" a British commander told me recently. \"This is now an American mission.\" </p> <p>The new American commander for US forces across the region, General David Petraeus, believes he can use the same tactics he has just employed in Iraq. He wants there now to be a <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/10/01/mideast/military.php\">surge of allied forces</a> into Afghanistan in the way he believes that the surge of 35,000 extra American forces into Iraq have turned round security there \u2013 though some say the picture isn't as <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article4887371.ece?openComment=true\">simple as that</a>. He is preparing to dispatch a further 15,000 US forces to Kabul by the spring. On his visit to London last week he was evidently seeking the UK government to match this by sending the bulk of the forces being pulled out of Iraq next year of around 3,500 to Afghanistan.</p> <p>The most Britain can send now is a few hundred extra specialists, engineers, signalers, logisticians and the like. There is an unspoken reluctance to commit further because of misgivings about the American approach to spreading the war into Pakistan and because the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/04/military.defence\">British defence budget</a> is bust \u2013 or even worse than bust. In July, Bush signed an unpublished operational order authorising American ground forces as well as drones and aircraft to raid into Taliban and al-Qaida sanctuary zones <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/11/washington/11policy.html?hp\">inside Pakistan</a>. </p> <p>Now there is <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/03/world/asia/03pstan.html?partner=rssyahoo&amp;emc=rss\">full-scale war</a> across the North-West Frontier Province, the Federally Administered Tribal Area (Fata) and hitherto peaceful districts like Swat. According to New York Times reports this weekend, hundreds of thousands of refugees are fleeing \u2013 some so desperate that they are seeking safety inside Afghanistan \u2013 as the Pakistan army takes on Taliban affiliates. The Americans believe that the al-Qaida command of Osama bin Laden is hiding in the remoter parts of Fata.</p> <p>However, al-Qaida seems to be resurgent and particularly active with a new offensive by its allies in Kashmir. Critics say that the American raids in Afghanistan and in the border areas are rapidly alienating the uncommitted in the population. The international command in Kabul has estimated that international forces may have killed up to 4,500 non-combatant civilians this year already. \"This means they may occasionally be able to win over the minds of the tribal communities temporarily, with schemes and subsidies,\" a former SAS commander told me this summer. \"But I think we've lost their hearts.\"</p> <p>The signs are, too, that despite American and Pakistani efforts, the terrorist campaigns of Taliban and al-Qaida are spreading deep into Pakistan \u2013 witness the bombing of the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad and bombings in India. There is also <a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jqDiypxY7Yct2qAR7kX9FKk_j3pA\">rising tension</a> between India and Pakistan \u2013 and some fear another Indian-Pakistan standoff, or even conflict, is on the horizon. This time both parties have nuclear weapons. </p> <p>The spread of conflict is becoming so complex that it is unlikely the present American strategy and concept of operations can stop things getting much worse, and soon. This is the real fear of commanders like Carleton-Smith and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/02/afghanistan.usforeignpolicy\">British ambassador to Kabul</a>, Sir Sherard Cowper-Coles, in his private warning to his French colleague that present strategies are \"doomed to failure\".</p> <p>For British ministers like Hutton, the picture is made darker still by the disastrous state of defence finances. Equipment programmes that should run at an average of \u00a316bn over the next 10 years are now expected to soar to more than double that at \u00a335bn. There are problems with big-ticket items such as the new Nimrod surveillance plane and the recently installed Bowman communications system (at \u00a32.2bn) that cannot meet today's requirements for battlefield and strategic communications. The extra \u00a33bn for the Astute submarine programme for this year and the next has already been blown, according to defence industry sources and more funds will be required to get the programme up and running fully. Some in-house MoD analysts and critics are warning that Britain cannot afford to run all three armed services at their present premier division level \u2013 some even say that the navy may have to choose between running aircraft carriers and submarines.</p> <p>\"Things are really about to implode,\" a senior MoD advisers said privately this last week. Gordon Brown had hoped that he could put off a proper defence and security review until after the next election. Now he and his new defence secretary may find they are forced to carry one out very soon. It cannot be the usual \"carry on chaps\" approach of so many recent policy utterances from MoD in recent years.</p> <p>This time it will have to assess what Britain really needs and can really do for its own security \u2013 and that doesn't necessarily mean treating America as the senior partner at all turns.</p> <p>This time the review will have to be properly costed \u2013 which the last one, in 1998, was not. For it to have any realistic and lasting value it will also have to examine what we have learned from our mistakes and shortcomings since we went piling into Afghanistan and then Iraq since 2001. It is too late for protecting tender egos: a grown-up inquest into the Afghan and Iraq campaigns may avert even worse disasters ahead.</p>",

Last week Icelandic bank Glitner was nationalised, after bank lending dried up, and there are fears that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/05/iceland.creditcrunch\">the whole country is at risk as its currency keeps falling</a>. By Monday morning there was still no sign of a rescue deal, and trading in Icelandic financial institutions was suspended.</p> <p>\u2022 Three more European countries \u2013 Germany, Austria and Denmark \u2013 followed Ireland and Greece's lead by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/06/europeanbanks.europe\">guaranteeing all savings</a>.

  "<p>Here at RealClimate we understandably have an intense interest in the positions of the presidential and vice-presidential candidates regarding global warming and carbon emissions. What the stance bodes for future action on climate change is consequential in itself, but beyond that the ability to use sound science in this case serves as a bellweather for the candidates' whole approach to science. Whatever else you can say about the candidates, it has been encouraging that both John McCain and Barack Obama favour mandatory action to reduce US carbon emissions.</p> <p>But, enter governor Sarah Palin, McCain's pick for VP. Palin's position on global warming has been stated quite clearly <a href=\"http://www.newsmax.com/headlines/sarah_palin_vp/2008/08/29/126139.html\">in this recent interview with the publication Newsmax</a>, where she says: \"A changing environment will affect Alaska more than any other state, because of our location. I'm not one though who would attribute it to being man-made.\" How is this to be reconciled with McCain's position? Do they just agree to differ? What does this bode for future actions if McCain were to win the election, especially in view of the fact that, in a Cheney-esque way, Palin is likely to be put in charge of energy policy? The recent vice-presidential debate sheds some light on the issue. A <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/10/03/america/03debate-transcript.php\">full transcript of the debate is here</a>.</p> <p>Palin seems to be attempting to defuse the whole issue by claiming the cause doesn't matter. When the moderator asked her: \"What is true and what is false about what we have heard, read, discussed, debated about the causes of climate change,\" Palin responded as follows:</p> <p>\"PALIN: Yes. Well, as the nation's only Arctic state and being the governor of that state, Alaska feels and sees impacts of climate change more so than any other state. And we know that it's real.</p> <p>\"I'm not one to attribute every man \u2014 activity of man to the changes in the climate. There is something to be said also for man's activities, but also for the cyclical temperature changes on our planet.\"</p> <p>I'm pretty sure that that last statement is a garbled attempt to reiterate what she said in the Newsmax interview, but you be the judge. Unlike the previous quote, this one at least has a nod in the direction of acknowledging (tentatively) the possibility of a human influence. What's important is what comes next:</p> <p>\"But there are real changes going on in our climate. And I don't want to argue about the causes. What I want to argue about is, how are we going to get there to positively affect the impacts?\"</p> <p>Dare we say that it, in fact, very much makes a difference what is causing global warming? If CO2 really weren't a major part of the cause, what in the world would be the point of John McCain's (or anybody's) stated policy of acting to reduce emissions? And even if you were of the school that says adaptation is better than mitigation, knowing the cause is an important part of knowing what kind of climate change you have to adapt to, how long it is likely to last, and how much worse it is likely to get in the future.</p> <p>Biden's answer, by comparison, was direct, straightforward, and simple:</p> <p>\"BIDEN: Well, I think it is manmade. I think it's clearly manmade. And, look, this probably explains the biggest fundamental difference between John McCain and Barack Obama and Sarah Palin and Joe Biden \u2014 Governor Palin and Joe Biden.</p> <p>If you don't understand what the cause is, it's virtually impossible to come up with a solution. We know what the cause is. The cause is manmade. That's the cause. That's why the polar icecap is melting.\"</p> <p>Well, maybe he left out the kind of caveats and qualifications you'd attach to the attribution of the recent loss of (North) polar sea ice if this were an AGU talk instead of a vice-presidential debate. Overall,though, the statement gets to the heart of the matter.</p> <p>One can moreover doubt even Palin's commitment to dealing with the consequences of climate change. Surely, that would include doing something to save the polar bears,yet the State of Alaska (against the advice of its own wildlife biologists) is suing the Interior department over its decision to list the polar bear as \"threatened\" \u2014 and this despite the fact that the Bush administration put so many qualifications on the listing as to make it essentially toothless. What's even more telling is that the brief submitted to Interior drew heavily on a list of climate skeptics (including the Marshall Institute's Willie Soon) that could easily have been culled from the infamous Inhofe 400. (See this <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/01/sarahpalin.climatechange\">theguardian.com/environment article</a>). Palin's role in bringing this case has not been peripheral; she has been very much at the center of the effort, and has consistently questioned the causal link between CO2 and global warming in making the case. As early as December 2006, she wrote to Secretary Kempthorne: \"\"When a species' habitat (in this case, sea ice) is declining due to climate change, but there are no discrete human activities that can be regulated or modified to effect change, what do you do?\" Further information about Palin's long fight against the listing, and her view of the scientific issues involved, can be found <a href=\"http://www.cnsnews.com/public/Content/article.aspx?RsrcID=34907\">here</a>.</p> <p>We will take this occasion to note also that Biden used the debate to reaffirm Obama's long standing position in favor of \"clean coal.\" Whether this is a good or bad thing depends on the extent to which the candidates understand what should really be meant by this term. From the point of view of global warming, the only \"clean\" coal would be coal burned with 100% carbon capture and sequestration \u2014 certainly worthy of research and pilot implementation, but not by any means a technology that can be counted on at present to solve the problem. (And of course, the term \"clean\" is even then relative, since what <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountaintop_removal_mining\">mountain top removal mining</a> does to the West Virginia hills and rivers is anything but \"clean\").</p> <p>So there you are.

  "<p>Environmental campaigners have attacked Starbucks after the discovery that millions of litres of water are wasted in its coffee shops every day, contradicting its much-boasted green credentials.</p> <p>An investigation by <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article1771553.ece\">the Sun</a> revealed that over 23.4m litres of water are poured down the drains of 10,000 outlets worldwide due to a policy of keeping a tap running non-stop.</p> <p>It is enough daily water for the entire 2 million population of Namibia in Africa, which has severe droughts, or to fill an Olympic pool every 83 minutes.</p> <p>A single Starbucks tap left running for just over three minutes wastes the amount of water one African needs to survive for a day in drought conditions.</p> <p>Each Starbucks has a cold tap behind the counter that runs into a sink known as a \"dipper well\" - used to wash utensils.</p> <p>Under the company's health and safety rules, staff are banned from turning the water off because management claim that a constant flow of water prevents germs breeding in taps.</p> <p>Water companies joined green activists in criticising the firm for harming the environment and wasting a vital natural resource. Experts said leaving taps running for hygiene reasons was \"nonsense\".</p> <p>Water shortage is one of the world's biggest problems. Australia is in the grip of a seven-year drought - the worst in a century.</p> <p>In the UK, Starbucks has 698 branches, each open for 13 hours a day. Even a slow tap flows three litres of water a minute, meaning Starbucks in the UK is wasting an estimated 1.63m litres a day \u2013 enough to supply Matlock village in Derbyshire.</p> <p>The running water policy was revealed after a Starbucks executive wrote back to a couple who complained about the tap at their local branch.</p> <p>Lisa Woolfe, 39, of Cuffley, Hertfordshire, said: \"I noticed a small sink behind the counter had its tap running. The assistant said the store was told to keep it running as it cleaned the pipes.</p> <p>\"I could not believe it but when we contacted head office, they confirmed the taps were left on and the water was not recycled.</p> <p>\"It is an absolutely astonishing waste of water, especially for a company which prides itself on its green credentials.\"</p> <p>Speaking to staff at Starbucks outlets around the world, the Sun found that many did not use the running tap or even know what it was for.</p> <p>Peter Robinson, of the environmental charity Waste Watch, said: \"Leaving taps running all day is a shocking waste of precious water. And to claim you are doing it for health and safety reasons is bonkers.</p> <p>\"Tap water comes from rivers and groundwater and wasting it can cause great harm to the environment and wildlife. Big companies should set an example.\"</p> <p>Jacob Tompkins, of the independent water efficiency agency Water Wise, said: \"If they are doing all their basic cleaning procedures, I fail to see why they would need to do this. There are a lot of other ways to stop a build-up of bacteria.</p> <p>\"The chance of a build-up in the spout is extremely remote. And if there is one they're not cleaning the tap properly.\"</p> <p>Ian Barker, the head of water resources at the Environment Agency, said: \"We are already taking too much water from the environment and are seeing reduced river flows.\"</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Starbucks said that the company's water use adhered to the World Health Organisation, US and EU environmental directives for in-store water supply standards. But she acknowledged the company could cut its water use.</p> <p>She defended its dipper well system, saying the technique was common and accepted in the industry.</p> <p>\"Starbucks' challenge is to balance water conservation with the need for customer safety,\" the spokeswoman said. \"The dipper well system currently in use in Starbucks retail stores ensures that we meet or exceed our own and local health standards.\"<br> She said the company had tested alternative methods such as the use of an ice bath but it was not successful. It was considering other alternatives and cut its water use per square foot this year. </p> <p>Starbucks is known for its campaigns and instore advertising boasting how it gives back to communities and the environment.</p> <p>In the company's latest corporate social responsibility report, it says: \"From promoting conservation in coffee-growing countries to in-store 'green teams' and recycling programs, Starbucks has established high standards for environmental responsibility.</p> <p>\"By taking steps to reduce waste from our operations and recycle, we can preserve the Earth's natural resources and enhance the quality of lives around the globe.</p> <p>\"Starbucks actively seeks opportunities to minimise our environmental impact.\"</p> <p>This is not the first time the Seattle-based firm has come under fire over its social and environmental credentials. In 2006, the Guardian reported how the US coffee giant has used its muscle to block an attempt by Ethiopia's farmers to copyright their most famous coffee bean types, denying them potential earnings of up to \u00a347m a year.</p> <p>As a result, Starbucks negotiated an agreement with the Ethiopian government to give the country more ownership and a better price for its coffee beans.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/oil \">Oil</a> fell to its lowest level in eight months today, offering drivers and companies the hope of lower petrol prices in the weeks ahead.</p> <p>The price of a barrel of US crude oil dropped to $89.38 in morning trading, a fall of $4. This followed sharp falls on world stockmarkets, reflecting concerns that demand for energy will drop as the global economy slows.</p> <p>This is the first time since mid-February that a barrel of US crude has cost less than $90, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/interactive/2008/sep/16/oilprice\">almost a year since it first broke through this level</a>.</p> <p>London Brent crude also fell this morning, losing almost $3.50 to $86.87.</p> <p>For most of 2008 oil has been well over $100 a barrel, causing pain at the pumps where petrol now costs well over \u00a31 a litre.</p> <p>A litre of unleaded petrol currently costs an average of 109.9p in the UK, with diesel costing 121.5p a litre, according to <a href=\"http://www.petrolprices.com/\">www.petrolprices.com</a>.</p> <p>Typically it costs around six weeks for changes in the oil price to feed through to the consumers, but there are already signs that prices are falling. On Friday Asda and Morrisons both cut their fuel prices, with a litre of unleaded now costing 105.9p at Asda, and 106.6p at Morrisons.</p> <p>Merrill Lynch analysts predicted last that the price of oil could sink to $50 a barrel next year, if the economic slowdown deepens into a recession.</p> <p>However, oil-producing cartel Opec may cut production to stem falling prices. Last month, as oil slipped below the symbolic $100 a barrel mark, it reversed earlier plans to boost output.</p>",
  "<p>Here's a bit of gossip to cheer you up if you're thinking about reaching for the financial panic button or going down to the ATM machine, withdrawing the overdraft and putting it under the mattress. A friend just back from the United States says he's convinced by the president's TV appearances lately that George Bush may be back on the booze.</p> <p>Now Alastair Campbell's Diaries made it plain that this is a relative term. When Bush once asked him at a reception why he wasn't having a drink Campbell explained that he was \u2014 is \u2014 a recovering alcoholic. But when they compared their personal drinking histories it quickly became clear that Alastair drank more for breakfast than the hell-raising George Dubya ever did in a day.</p> <p>Personally, I think my friend is probably wrong. But it's a thought. Would Bush, cruelly marginalised by the banking crisis, be a better president with a drink or two inside him? Some leaders are, you know, though they have to keep a tight grip on not getting too tight. Harold Wilson did not manage it towards the end, but Churchill, a man with a prodigious capacity for the stuff, usually did. \"I have taken more out of drink than drink has taken out of me,\" he once remarked. </p> <p>Come to think of it, when someone complained to President Lincoln that Ulysses S Grant, his most successful civil war general, was a drunk, Honest Abe mildly asked what brand of whisky Grant liked, so he could have it sent to his other commanders. Alas, Grant later made a lousy president.</p> <p>Right. Back to the trivia, the global banking crisis and Gordon Brown's ministerial reshuffle, Peter Mandelson included. The German decision to guarantee bank deposits, whatever the small print eventually says it means, is another scary moment, given that it came barely 24 hours after Angela Merkel reproached the Irish for doing something similar. </p> <p>It now looks as if our own precautionary response will be to buy into the banks, a semi-nationalisation which should eventually get the taxpayers money back when \u2013 when \u2013 things eventually return to normal.</p> <p>I recall <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2008/sep/19/banking.banks\">saying in this spot two weeks ago</a> when leftwing MPs were urging nationalisation as a remedy to all our woes \u2013 after all, Bush was doing it, wasn't he? \u2013 that the real fear isn't nationalisation, which is what you do when everything else has failed. It's nationalism. </p> <p>I was never a great fan of the eurozone and glad we stayed out. Without parallel \u2014 and prior \u2014 political union it was easy to predict it would one day break up. But I did not think it would show these sort of cracks so quickly. That is bad news for all of us too.</p> <p>When the ordure hits the fan \"beggar thy neighbour\" is what countries tend to do and we all lose. Look at the 1930s and fear for a re-run as the public authorities fail to stem the tide. What was being called \"irrational exuberance\" a decade ago is now irrational pessimism. Trade is what drives civilisations forward.</p> <p>So is Peter Mandelson's return part of the answer? He has been abused from all sides since Friday's announcement, often a good sign. It is even said that he was rude about Brown over lunch in a Corfu restaurant in August. Can that be true? Of course it can. That's Mandelson's way. </p> <p>Whereas some people are naturally discreet, others tend towards the mouthy. Mandelson is one of them, rude about everyone, that's what makes him so interesting and Brown's gamble interesting too. Read <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/oct/06/gordonbrown.labour\">Patrick Wintour's account of the smaller changes in today's Guardian</a>. George Bush may not be the only one reaching for the tonic water.</p> <p>Myself I think Brown's action has bound the cabinet's so-called Blairites into his regime, though wise colleagues tell me that I was wrong to write on Friday that Mandelson is fully investing in Brown's survival. Not everyone is happy, but they will have to lump it for now. There are more important things to worry about.</p> <p>MPs are now heading back to Westminster after the summer recess for a hair-raising final three months of 2008. I shall endeavour to find out their mood about the wider reshuffle and much else, then report back later. Pints all round?</p>",
  "<p>Executives across Silicon Valley are finally admitting that they are not insulated from the turmoil in the world's financial markets \u2013 after months of refusing to believe that an economic downturn would affect the hi-tech industry.</p> <p>Online auction giant <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/ebay\">eBay</a> looks set to be the latest west coast company to slash jobs, with reports suggesting that it could begin announcing as many as 1,500 cuts \u2013 10% of the company's workforce \u2013 as early as today.</p> <p>Such an announcement would be another sharp reminder to Silicon Valley's most powerful, many of whom have continued to insist that the technology sector would remain unaffected by the credit crunch \u2013 despite evidence that it was already hitting them hard.</p> <p>Two weeks ago <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/google\">Google</a> chief executive Eric Schmidt waved off suggestions that his company could be in for tough times if a deep recession took told \u2013 particularly since Google is increasingly reliant on the advertising industry.</p> <p>\"My guess is the drama is in New York, not here,\" he told reporters at the company's headquarters in Mountain View, California. \"It's business as usual at Google.\"</p> <p>Since Schmidt's statement, Google shares have dropped a further 28 points, ending up at 386 by the close of play on Friday. Last December stock was trading at an all-time high of 714.</p> <p>Even more bullish was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/microsoft\">Microsoft</a> boss Steve Ballmer. As recently as September 26, he deflected concerns that the crisis would shake through to his company, claiming there was still \"buoyancy\" in the technology sector.</p> <p>\"Our industry is not immune to what goes on in the global economy,\" he said. \"And yet as I travel\u2026 given the current circumstances, people still see a certain buoyancy in the market.\"</p> <p>That message turned around sharply in just a few hours, however, when Ballmer was forced to concede. \"We have a lot of business with the corporate sector as well as with the consumer sector, and whatever happens economically will certainly affect itself on Microsoft,\" he said at a meeting in Norway on Friday.</p> <p>Microsoft shares were trading at 26 points at the end of last week, having lost a third of their value in the past year.</p> <p>The situation is similar for the technology industry's other giants, leaving the market confused by mixed messages. Stock market flotations have dried up for hi-tech companies over the past year, and even the venture capitalists who fund early stage businesses are cutting back drastically. Investors are so jittery, in fact, that the tiniest of rumours can have a huge impact.</p> <p>On Friday a single report \u2013 put out by a blogger on an unfiltered part of CNN's website \u2013 claimed that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple\">Apple</a> chief executive Steve Jobs had suffered a heart attack. Before the company even had time to deny the rumour, Apple shares had started dropping sharply, losing 8% of their value in just a few minutes. Although the prices quickly corrected once it became clear that there was no truth in the report, it became clear how quickly panic could take over.</p> <p>Another company facing an uncertain future is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/yahoo\">Yahoo</a>, which has struggled for several years to reassure investors over its future \u2013 despite being one of the world's biggest web companies. Just months after spurning a $44bn takeover bid from Microsoft, chief executive Jerry Yang last week sent a memo to all staff which indicated he could be preparing for mass layoffs.</p> <p>Yang's message said that Yahoo needed to \"get fit as an organisation\" and said that he had hired management consultants Bain &amp; Co. Job cuts look certain as a result, following hard on the heels by the enormous 25,000 cuts announced by computer Hewlett Packard last month.</p> <p>Some parts of the hi-tech economy are better suited to the tough economic climate, however.</p> <p>The videogames industry, for example, often benefits when people decide to cut down their entertainment budgets in favour of staying home. Last week British retailer Game announced improved pre-tax profits of \u00a333.4m for the first half of the year and predicted a 12% increase in sales for 2008.</p> <p>But some leading experts retain their view that the wider internet industry will be able to weather the storm, even if it may prove tough going.</p> <p>\"The advertising market as a whole will slow down, but I think search advertising will be less affected,\" said Danny Sullivan, the editor of news website SearchEngineLand.com. \"I think someone like Google has more than enough to make it through.\"</p>",
  "<p>The BBC is increasingly under attack - what should the corporation's priority be?</p> <p><strong>Irwin Stelzer, director of the Hudson Institute's Centre for Economic Policy; influential American rightwing economist</strong><br>So straight a question deserves an equally straight answer. The biggest<br>problem facing the BBC is waning legitimacy. More precisely, the decreasingly defensible method by which it is funded.</p> <p>The disarmingly named licence fee \u2013 a tax that dare not speak its name<br>\u2013 is increasingly extracted from people who have little or no use for some or all of its ever-expanding services. How an organisation with a market share in the low 30% range can successfully demand that everyone owning a television set \u2013 or, if BBC has its way, a computer \u2013 pay up escapes me.</p> <p>But demand it can, and backed by a powerful lobbying effort, and the support of an elite audience delighted to be subsidised by those with more plebeian tastes, it prevails. At least for now.</p> <p><strong>Jean Seaton, professor of media history, Westminster University; author of forthcoming history of the BBC</strong><br>Without a doubt, it is that the international worldwide significance of the<br>BBC is totally underestimated within Britain. It is regarded here as a domestic Auntie, and we treat it as something to be sniped at, which is shameful. Policy discussions are parochial and suburban when the BBC is global.</p> <p>In fact, it is a world resource of the most necessary kind. If we lose it,<br>we're on a one-way spiral, downwards, and the world loses something it<br>vitally needs. We really don't appreciate the significance of having a decent, impartial news gatherer and broadcaster, at a point when news everywhere else around the globe is under huge pressure from commercial and political forces. I have, in the past three months, visited Sarajevo, where the BBC is a beacon of honest reporting, and Somalia, where it is doing extraordinary work. In addition, the BBC sets the standard for everyone else to aspire to.</p> <p>This is a Churchill moment. We stand alone.</p> <p><strong>Gavyn Davies, former chairman of the BBC</strong><br>The BBC's greatest strategic threat is that the licence fee will be \"top<br>sliced\", or shared between the BBC and other broadcasters such as Channel 4. Public acceptability of the licence fee depends on their understanding that it goes wholly to the BBC, an organisation of which they mostly approve, and whose output they still consume in huge numbers. Top slicing will leave the BBC underfunded, and the public will start to ask itself why it is paying so much money for obscure, possibly elitist, programming on commercial channels. The fragile settlement that enables to BBC to be sufficiently funded will be broken.</p> <p>The chairman and director general should lay their bodies across the tracks to stop this dangerous notion.</p> <p><strong>Nigel McCulloch, Bishop of Manchester; member of the House of Lords culture, media &amp; sports committee</strong><br>The new MediaCity in Salford shows the BBC's pioneering spirit, but its<br>ability to be intelligently creative is becoming constrained. The problem is not just commercial pressures, which face all broadcasters, or the complexity of connecting with an increasingly diverse nation, or avoiding stuffiness without being over populist.</p> <p>The huge challenge is posed by the changed environment of a short-term, contract-based broadcasting culture. How can it retain the very qualities that for so long have been a source of BBC strength: distinctiveness, integrity and credibility across all its output. In short, can the BBC be trusted?</p> <p><strong>Maziar Darvish, head of internet incubator Neutron Ventures</strong><br>The BBC archive and BBC content should be made available to early-stage companies - if not all companies - because that is the main asset and expertise they have, producing good content, whether that's audio, video, databases or many, many column inches of text.</p> <p>The assets that it has are significant and those assets are effectively being clung on to, sometimes being exploited in competition with industry and sometimes they represent a potential threat to competition - such as Lonely Planet.</p> <p><strong>Kate Allen, director of Amnesty International UK</strong><br>Some stories from around the world desperately need to be told. They include not only the stories of ordinary people caught up in conflict or disaster but also those of men, women and children whose lives have been damaged by events that have long-since slipped from the headlines or which never made the news.</p> <p>For nearly two decades we've been encouraging and acknowledging high-quality human rights journalism with our annual media awards. But these programmes will not necessarily be quick, cheap or easy to make and a really big issue facing the BBC is whether it can continue to produce such strong and challenging broadcasting and online content.</p> <p>It is vitally important that the BBC does so, not only because it vastly enriches the experience of the viewer or listener but also because publicity and exposure are absolutely vital in improving human rights. By opening a window on the world, the BBC can also help to change it.</p> <p><strong>Interviews by Maggie Brown</strong></p>",
  "<p>So <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/06/mandelson.tonyblair\">Peter Mandelson is back</a>. The dream team is reassembled. Labour's political renaissance and the country's economic recovery seems thus now assured. But I don't think so. The political challenge facing the Labour government today is hugely different from that of the 1990s, when the Blair/Brown/Mandelson triumvirate came together.</p> <p>Then, winning the high regard of the City was deemed crucial to Labour's electoral fortunes. It is hardly surprising to see the City giving three rousing cheers to Peter Mandelson's reappearance, leading the government department they appear to think they own. Labour's love affair with the City has led to financial services becoming an ever-bigger part of the British economy.</p> <p>But new challenges demand new responses. I hope Mandelson's finely honed political antennae are tuning in to the new realities. Those who preached the values of deregulation in the City have taken our economy to the edge of a precipice. Nobody can yet be certain how deep and damaging the downturn will become if the banking system remains locked in a devastating seizure. And voter anger is turning against those whose recklessness and greed have caused this crisis.</p> <p>The difficulties in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/05/wall.street.bailout\">getting a rescue package agreed</a> in the United States shows the problem. People want the economy rescued, but they damned sure do not want to rescue those they hold responsible, especially if the undeserving victims continue to lose their homes and livelihoods.</p> <p>Each day brings new headlines and symptoms of the financial crisis. Governments and regulators need to be swift and smart in their response, and be ready to surprise.</p> <p>But we will need a new long-term economic settlement once the current crisis passes \u2013 indeed setting it out now can help bring some stability to the current crisis. And it will need to rethink many of the assumptions that have shaped the political and economic consensus since deregulation and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang_(financial_markets)\">City big bang</a>, in particular the privileged status given to the finance sector above all other parts of the economy.</p> <p>The first principle of the new settlement must be the recognition of a bigger role for the state both in setting rules and in active intervention. This would have been hugely controversial just a few weeks ago, but is now happening on both sides of the Atlantic. But it must continue, and a priority must be to rebalance the economy. This will require much greater regulation of the finance sector, and help for those parts of the economy that have lost out from the City fixation. </p> <p>Without going back to failed 1960s models, it is time to build an active state supporting and shaping, not just manufacturing but the creative sectors and others where we excel. The government's proposals for green jobs are a step in the right direction. With the failure of the demutualised <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/banks\">building societies</a> and reduction of competition in retail banking, not to mention continued exposure of abuses such as the mis-selling of payment protection insurance, banks must brace themselves for a new regulatory environment.</p> <p>Next the government must do all in its power to protect ordinary people from the deep downturn now in prospect and this much be right at the top of the agendas of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/04/labour.economy\">new economic councils</a> established by the prime minister. For a start we will need further intervention to protect homeowners threatened by repossession from eviction. Next we must assume that the tax take will fall and that public spending will face new pressures as unemployment mounts. There will be an inevitable threat to public services, but while tax avoidance and evasion among the super-rich and our biggest corporations remains so high, such cuts will be unjustifiable and unpopular.</p> <p>Voters know there are going to be some hard times, but they demand that the misery is shared fairly. Those with the broadest backs and who most bear the responsibility for what has gone wrong must make their contribution. My suspicion is that we are going to require further dramatic intervention before we get to the other side. The financial system must be kept running, but the state must ensure that any support is paid back with interest. If we need dramatic liquidity injection, then the Swedish model of government taking an equity stake for the medium term may well be best.</p> <p>And the test that voters will apply is whether the greed and excess at the top has been tamed. This will require the tax gap to be closed by cracking down on the tax avoidance practiced by the super-rich. A new regulatory structure must curb the bonus culture and excessive boardroom salaries. Ordinary savers and pension scheme members must ask hard questions about why their fund managers allowed this greed to spread and feed systemic risk.</p> <p>In the 1990s, Peter Mandelson played a pivotal role in shaping Labour as a party fit for government. He has rare political skills. But the task facing Labour now is to fashion genuinely new strategies to deliver the goal of fairness articulated so powerfully by the prime minister at Labour's recent conference. That will mean posing some profound challenges to Britain's financial establishment, not paying court to them.</p>",
  "<p>Ed Miliband will be greeted today on his first full day of work as the new secretary of state for energy and climate change with a 100-page Oxfam report showing how disjointed the government has become in tackling these two most pressing environmental problems.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/resources/policy/climate_change/forecast_tomorrow.html\"> Oxfam Forecast report </a> highlights how the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (DBRR) and the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) have been contradictory in their policies. </p> <p>It likens the different interests of companies, government departments and public attitudes as a \"gathering storm\", which must be resolved if UK climate policy is to secure a low-carbon future.</p> <p>\"Too often it has been a case of the left hand having no idea what the right hand is up to, and this [new department] must now bring a much-needed cohesiveness to government policies. With global climate and energy security at stake, the government must now demonstrate powerful leadership,\" said Barbara Stocking, head of Oxfam.</p> <p>The report also urges companies like E.ON and Shell to reconsider their plans in light of climate change. \"Strong decisions in boardrooms and Whitehall must be made over the next few months to ensure that we meet the challenges of climate change and begin to give the people we work with the chance for a better flood and famine free future.\" </p> <p>\"If E.ON is allowed to build the UK's first coal plant in 34 years, annual CO2 emissions from the Kingsnorth plant will be 7m tonnes \u2014 more than the combined output of 30 developing countries.

It is the directness of art, its short circuit to the emotional core of our beings, that makes it so powerful a means of communication and, thus, of effecting change.</p> <p>Growing up in Idi Amin's Uganda, I experienced first-hand how art could function on more than one level. Artists were commissioned by the state to paint politically biased images glorifying Amin's achievements and honouring visiting heads of state. These same artists were also painting images rich and sensuous in form and loaded with metaphor, which, taken at more than face value, provided a brave emotional language voicing dissent and passion ignited by such a tyrannical regime. Images of fear, images of betrayal, or simple records of the atrocities enabled people to dream of change. The bravery and poignancy of other images allowed ordinary people to believe that the human spirit would triumph in the end, and, importantly, this visual permanent record made people feel sacrifice would not be in vain.</p> <p>I have recently returned to Uganda where, with my fellow trustees, we have created the <strong><a href=\"http://www.ruwenzorisculpture.com/\">Ruwenzori Sculpture Foundation</a></strong>. We believe that through the making of objects we can have a direct impact on the surrounding culture, environment and economy, and through collaboration with an independent medical charity help with the many challenges that affect people's health locally.</p> <p>The first requirement after training our principal Ugandan partners in this venture was to create a permanent base in the country. Too many well-intentioned projects fail in their attempts to effect change because of their transience. Change takes time, often decades. With a settlement that includes housing, studios, a foundry and gallery, together with the clinic, we believe we have the ability to stimulate a generation of people and change their lives forever through various means.</p> <p>Firstly, through the environment: a foundry needs fuel, so we are planting trees. By employing local farmers to grow fast growing species for us we are encouraging others to use renewable fuels and, thus, limit erosion of the topsoil. We are also recycling resources and managing water. Already the local community can see the benefit of managing land in an ecologically sensitive manner.<br> Secondly, through education: we want to provide the opportunity for the development of creativity and the cultural environment in which it can mature. Art can define a community, promote social pride and is a cultural ambassador between clan, tribe, state or continent, as well as being a means of communication and source of income. Our intention is to hold residencies where artists can share ideas and inspire one another in an atmosphere and environment conducive to creating beautiful and relevant objects.</p> <p>Thirdly, through opportunity: traditional education in Uganda puts an emphasis on academic qualifications. Our training schemes value manual ability and visual ideas. No exam qualifications or academic experience are needed. This favours individuals who have been bypassed by the conventional school system, allowing girls in particular, with their traditional skills in weaving, basket-making and pottery, to compete for opportunities.</p> <p>Fourthly, through exposure: our centre will become a cultural destination in a country where tourism is of growing importance, providing a link between the village and the international community. It will be a forum for the arts and will provide common ground for sharing ideas and experience. From pen friends to reciprocal residencies, cultural exchanges will build on modest beginnings.</p> <p>Lastly, the therapeutic value of having a skill or craft is of immense importance to a country ravaged by war, Aids and other diseases. Orphans and child soldiers, traumatised by their experiences, will benefit from the learning of skills and creatively expressing their anger and fear. Social and political change will surely follow such opportunity, education and dialogue, quite apart from the commercial opportunities. We feel that the potential revenues for the country from craft and art, at present barely registering, are immense as the wealth of talent is hugely under utilised.</p> <p>Music is by far the highest profile art form in Uganda; even clan totems have musical form. We hope to make sculpture as culturally vibrant as music and dance by collaborating with musicians and working to find sculptural equivalents to the richness and diversity of the musical experience.</p> <p>In time, we are sure that through a sustainable permanent facility, artists will lead the local community and the larger population to change first their experiences and then their expectations to become players in the world arts scene. This will in return filter back and create real change in the physical health of people and their environment, bringing world attention to what we believe is the continent of the future.</p> <p>Small amounts of invested time, resource and money can have a disproportionate cumulative effect. This is one of art's advantages in being a catalyst for change in society - and healthy, creative, productive individuals are the agents of that change. Art is unique. It can be practiced by a single individual, but have an impact on all who look at it.</p>",
  "<p>Energy industry <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/regulators\">regulator</a> Ofgem said this morning that its seven-month inquiry into Britain's energy markets had found no evidence of a cartel.</p> <p>However, it concluded that while markets were generally working well some consumers were missing out on the full benefits of competition.</p> <p>It singled out the 4.3 million consumers without gas who it said had no access to the best deals, as well as vulnerable customers, including the elderly and those on low incomes.</p> <p>The regulator said it was proposing wide-ranging reforms to improve the way the market worked and warned the energy companies that if they failed to deliver they could be referred to the Competition Commission.</p> <p>Ofgem's proposals include tougher rules on doorstep selling, new requirements to give customers more information on how to get the best deals and measures to ban what it described as unfair price differences for customers who paid in different ways, for example pre-payment and direct debit. It also wants to encourage new entrants into the markets to challenge the Big Six suppliers - not least by ensuring they can buy electricity from the wholesale market at competitive prices.</p> <p>Ofgem's chief executive, Alistair Buchanan, said: \"These are hard times and we are taking a hard line on behalf of disadvantaged customers. We accept global influences are pushing up costs but the suppliers must change their behaviour and cement consumer confidence. If they fail to satisfy our requirements voluntarily then we can move to a Competition Commission reference.</p> <p>\"Initial findings from our energy market probe give us grounds to demand that companies end practices that hinder customers, especially the vulnerable, from getting the best deal . But we have found no evidence of a cartel.\"</p> <p>Ofgem decided to set up the inquiry in late February in the wake of a round of price increases from the big six suppliers. </p> <p>One of the regulator's concerns were the differences between the timing and spread of the price cuts introduced by the energy companies in 2007 and the increases at the beginning of 2008.</p> <p>Ofgem was concerned that while eight months separated the announcement of the first and last cuts the subsequent increases took place over a much shorter time scale.</p> <p>Prices have since been increased again with the companies blaming soaring prices in the wholesale gas and electricity markets for the need to increase bills for residential customers.</p> <p>Declining output from Britain's sector of the North Sea has made the UK increasingly dependent on imports of gas from continental Europe where gas prices are closely linked to the world oil price.</p> <p>The second round of increases, which took annual household bills to around \u00a31,200 a year, brought renewed calls for the government to impose a windfall tax on the energy companies. The government stopped short of such a move but negotiated an industry-funded \u00a31bn package to increase spending on energy saving and efficiency measures. </p> <p>Earlier this year the cross party business and enterprise committee of MPs set up its own inquiry which reported in late July. The committee said it had found no evidence of active collusion between the companies. However it noted that in a retail market dominated by six companies \"it is easy for those players to make informed judgements about the behaviour of their competitors. This alone can distort competition.\"</p> <p>The committee said there were real problems which needed to be addressed through better market design, specific regulatory steps and continuing pressure for the greater liberalisation of energy markets elsewhere in Europe.</p>",

  "<h2>The Film</h2> <p>During the 1960s and 1970s Arthur Penn made a series of films that uncompromisingly engaged with the reality of America's violent past. Penn re-invented the gangster genre with Bonnie and Clyde (1967), a film that re-cast the main protagonists as lovers-on-the-run, in French nouvelle vague style.</p> <p>Penn's directorial career began with The Left Handed Gun (1958). This was a western story that looked at one of the most compelling stories of the old west \u2013 the legend of Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid. The film stars Paul Newman in the role of Billy, with John Dehner as Pat.</p> <p>The film was an attempt by Penn to unpick the romanticised mythology of the west in Hollywood. The revisionist western of the 1960s and 1970s accepted the arbitrary violence of the wild-west as a product of social, political and economic forces beyond the control or understanding of its cast. Accordingly, the new heroes were presented as composite characters with both good and evil in their natures. Left Handed Gun was originally conceived as a vehicle for James Dean, the poster boy of American teenage anxiety and rebellion during the 1950s.</p> <p>The revisionist western is, at its most accomplished, a proto-Marxist exposition of the determining forces that shaped the westward American expansion. The genre also includes Once Upon a Time in the West from 1968, and Heaven's Gate (1980). These films refuse the complacent moral judgements used to justify the manifest destiny of western expansion.</p> <p>Sam Peckinpah's Pat Garrett and Billy the Kidd (1973), with Kris Kristofferson, James Coburn and Bob Dylan was part of a slightly different effort. Peckinpah's project, begun with Ride the High Country (1962) and The Wild Bunch (1969), sought to make a definitive statement about the American west. For Peckinpah, the isolation of the far west removed all but the most basic of determining forces. The result was an unforgiving environment that revealed the moral integrity, or otherwise, of the men and women placed within it. For Peckinpah, failure was always met with a bullet. More recently, Clint Eastwood has explored this version of the west.</p> <h2>The Legend of Pat and Billy</h2> <p>The legend plays itself out against a backdrop of the small, but intensely violent, Lincoln County wars. This conflict pitched the vested interests of ranchers against those of the wider community. The war ranged across New Mexico in America's southwest during 1878.</p> <p>Billy the Kid was a member of the ranchers' outlaw force, named The Regulators. These enforcers, drawn from criminal elements across the southwest, eventually ran out of control. They were brutally suppressed in a series of bloody shoot-outs. Those that survived were dispersed and forced on the run. The implacable law-man Pat Garrett, eventually tracked, caught and executed Billy in 1881.</p> <p>The legend of Pat and Billy was mostly created through the sensationalist memoir published by Pat Garrett in 1882. The myth showed Garrett as an enforcer who would follow his prey to the inevitable and bloody conclusion. This myth has been variously recast across American history and in various contexts, so that corruption and lawlessness will never, in the USA, be allowed to go unpunished.</p> <p>Billy the Kid, like Jesse James, is one of the hero villains of the wild-west. His reputation as a violent killer was tempered by recollections of his friendly and personable character. Surviving photographs of Billy show his appreciation of fine clothes. He was remembered as a neat dresser who favoured an unadorned Mexican sombrero hat. So, Billy survives as both outlaw and folk hero dandy.</p> <p>The attempt, by revisionist Hollywood, to rehabilitate the western outlaw reached its apotheosis in George Roy Hill's Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969).</p> <h2>The Poster</h2> <p>This week's poster is a piece of ephemera from the Royal College of Art in London. The poster is a simple, rough-and-ready, example of student design and screen-printing.</p> <p>The design of the poster, narrow portrait, allowed it to be printed two-up on double crown paper measuring 20x30 inches. The poster was printed in a tiny print run for display within the College. The make-ready for screen-printing would have taken a few hours using new photo-mechanical processes.</p> <p>The poster design is made up of several pictorial elements. These are the map of the USA, the lawman's stripes and the revolver. The map is embellished with a line of letterpress printing, The Western Plains. This second printing, combining two quite separate forms of printmaking would only have been possible within the non-commercial environment of the RCA.</p> <p>The success, or otherwise, of poster designs at the RCA could always be judged by how many were removed from the walls and how quickly. John Lewis, typographer at the RCA, saved this example.</p> <h2>The RCA</h2> <p>The Royal College of Art played a key role in the transformations of British visual culture during the 1960s. The first generation of post-war designers rejected the sense of established good taste prevailing in Britain at the end of the 1950s. The use of irregular typography, the general references to popular culture, and to American popular culture in particular, were strategies calculated to wind up the old guard.</p> <p>The conceptualisation of society based around the hedonistic consumerism of experience and lifestyle began in the early 1950s at the ICA in London. The artists and architects associated with the Independent Group rejected established and polite good taste. These artists revelled in the more energetic and visceral possibilities of cultural production.</p> <p>In this context, it was entirely appropriate that the College Film Society should provide screenings of American, rather than of higher-brow, European art-house films.</p> <p>The College magazine Ark provides a more permanent legacy of these ideas. The editors recall that their efforts were an attempt to produce a magazine as part of a visual culture whose experience was immediate and exciting. They rejected the usual idea that the work should be about something beyond itself and the immediate here-and-now.</p> <p>Eventually, these ideas formed the basis of swinging London and its politics of an ephemeral and hedonistic consumption. Later, the same willingness to wind up the establishment formed the basis for the punk counter-culture of the mid 1970s.</p> <p>The designer of the poster remains unknown. Perhaps it was Brian Haynes who later worked at The Sunday Times Magazine. Maybe it was Brian Tattersfield.</p>",
  "<p>For 10 days in August, the world held its breath. Its attention was fixed on a small Caucasian province where the old passions of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/26/russia.georgia2\">cold war</a> seemed to have reignited. The first <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/01/russia.georgia2\">emergency summit</a> of European leaders since September 11 was held in Brussels soon after, and the European Parliament was briefed by French foreign minister Bernard Kouchner on the crisis. But through the glamour and etiquette of high-level politics, and out of sight of concerned international strategists, the human tragedy of the conflict has too often struggled to make itself known. </p> <p>The world's attention already seems to have moved on. Although the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/04/russia.eu\">international community</a> has done much good work already, providing people with desperately needed shelter and food, these efforts must continue if Georgia is to recover. We hear much about showing solidarity with others, especially from those of us who are on the left. But solidarity should be about showing as much concern for the suffering of people 2,000 miles away as we do for the suffering of people just down the road. It should be about not ignoring people's pleas for help from Europe and America, about not taking sides, about not deserting those in trouble when they need it most. </p> <p>Because a humanitarian crisis is unfolding by the day in Georgia. I returned last week from a European Parliament fact-finding mission sent to the war-torn north and west. For such a small country, the numbers affected are huge. It is estimated that the Russian-Georgian conflict has left some 130,000 people displaced and desperately in need of help. Even a month and a half after the conflict, in the eyes of the people I met I could still see their shock at how quickly their communities had turned to rubble. People are no longer able to provide for themselves because of the devastation of their lands and livelihoods. School children are attending school, but there is a shortage of books to teach them with. </p> <p>I went to Georgia as a member of a Parliament working group on reproductive health, HIV/AIDS, and development, set up to assess the impact of the fighting on these policy areas. I was looking specifically at the impact that the conflict and the current humanitarian situation is having on women and their families. </p> <p>As in all humanitarian crises, it is <a href=\"http://newsblaze.com/story/20080923115515tsop.nb/topstory.html\">women</a> who have been disproportionately affected. Of the 130,000 refugees there are around 14,000 pregnant women, many of whom are now forced to live without the basic medication and sanitation that any expectant mother should expect. During my time in Gori, a city at the heart of the fighting, I met women and young families whose young lives had been blighted by the war. One woman had given birth hours before and simply had nowhere to go to care for her child; other women had miscarried as a result of the traumas they were made to undergo. </p> <p>Vulnerable young families had been forced due to the fighting into grimy, unsanitary conditions. In the area surrounding Gori, down-trodden Soviet architecture had been made even more ramshackle by shelling and small arms fire. Believe me, this is no place to endure the trials of pregnancy or give birth. </p> <p>So it is sadly unsurprising that, according to recent statistics from the World Health Organisation , around 30% of deliveries currently taking place in Georgia are encountering severe difficulties. And the medical infrastructure in and around Gori has been utterly destroyed, leaving the 10,000 or so refugees in the area cut adrift. </p> <p>The European Parliament recently voted to take urgent action on Millennium Development Goal (MDG) Number 5, which aims to reduce the sickening global levels of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/28/sierraleone.internationalaidanddevelopment\">maternal mortality</a> \u2013 one woman dies in childbirth every minute. In the Caucasus we are witnessing just how the breakdown of infrastructure can exacerbate health crises. Measures need to be put in place immediately to secure the healthy futures of women and children in the region. But these measures need to take into account the widest ramifications of conflict. An example: there are four mobile health units in the area I visited. These, however, had all been deployed to the zone where fighting was heaviest, leaving the remainder of the rural population without health cover for pregnancies and births. </p> <p>So if we as MEPs are to make good the commitments we have laid out for ourselves, we need to recognise the full human horror of this conflict, and conflicts worldwide. The great games of the instigators of the crisis should not be allowed to distract the international community from its commitment to the MDGs. The aftermath of this war cannot be allowed to do more damage to those who are worst affected \u2013 people who simply wish to live their lives, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/18/georgia.gender\">women</a> who want to give birth to their children without fear of infection and death.</p>",
  "<p>The government is facing increased pressure to follow its European counterparts in pledging 100% protection for UK savers. </p> <p><strong>What has the German government pledged? </strong></p> <p>Chancellor Angela Merkel vowed that the federal government would guarantee all private savings accounts in German banks. Finance minister Peer Steinbrueck said that from today German citizens need not worry about \"a single euro of their deposits\" during the global financial crisis. </p> <p><strong>Is Germany the only country to offer such a promise? </strong></p> <p>No. Last week Ireland said all money held in savings accounts at six institutions - Allied Irish Bank, Bank of Ireland, Anglo-Irish Bank, Irish Life and Permanent, Irish Nationwide Building Society and the Educational Building Society - will be guaranteed in their entirety. Greece, Denmark and Austria have likewise guaranteed their depositors' savings. </p> <p><strong>What is the situation in the UK? </strong></p> <p>In the UK, savings of \u00a350,000 are covered under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). The limit relates to deposits with an organisation, regardless of how many accounts the customer holds. The limit had, until recently, been set at \u00a335,000 but as a result of the current crisis, ministers agreed to up the ceiling. </p> <p><strong>Can UK citizens benefit from the announcements in other countries? </strong></p> <p>Yes. Three Irish banks - Allied Irish Bank, Anglo Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland - have branches in the UK. These will be covered by the Irish government's guarantee and British citizens can open accounts with relative ease at branches in the UK. In addition, the Post Office's savings products are run by Bank of Ireland, giving customers 100% protection. </p> <p>There is also nothing stopping UK customers opening up an account with a bank branch in Ireland. Although it may be harder, as many will want you to appear in person to open the account. </p> <p><strong>How have British banks responded? Aren't they at a disadvantage?</strong> </p> <p>On Wednesday the British Bankers' Association (BBA) challenged the Irish government, claiming that the guarantee was anti-competitive, especially for banks in Northern Ireland. It fears that UK savers will move their money to Irish banks in a bid to benefit from the guarantee offered. </p> <p><strong>But don't some institutions in the UK already offer 100% protection? </strong></p> <p>Yes. When Northern Rock collapsed, the UK government made an exception to end the run on the bank, ensuring that all of the Rock's savers will have deposits covered in their entirety. </p> <p>National Savings &amp; Investment, which is backed by the Treasury, also offers complete protection on people saving through its products. And Bradford &amp; Bingley savings are safe while part of the collapsed bank goes through the process of being transferred to Santander, owner of Abbey. </p> <p><strong>So, if ministers pledged complete protection for Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley, what's to say they won't do the same if another bank fails? </strong></p> <p>Nothing. The whole question in many experts' view is purely theoretical. It would, it is argued, be almost inconceivable for the government to let savers lose their money as a result of a bank failing. Unlike more risky investments, people are not given explicit warnings that they could lose their savings - the whole stability of the banking system depends on the belief that money is safe in the bank. If people started to lose money, it would lead to instability on a grand scale and a return to a run on the banks as panicked savers attempt to move cash out. </p> <p><strong>So why doesn't the government just follow the German and Irish lead and guarantee all savings?</strong></p> <p>Because it shifts liability from the banks to the taxpayers. And we are talking about a lot of money. Estimates suggest it would mean a risk running into the trillions of pounds. This would place a huge burden on public finances. </p> <p>And it could be the \"thin end of the wedge\", some fear. Banks' business customers may be next in asking for their money to be covered. A 100% guarantee could also impact on the government's ability to raise funds which in turn could hit public spending. The theory has it that with a promise to protect all savings, people would be less willing to buy into secure state-backed bonds. </p> <p>The main attraction of government \"gilt-edged\" bonds is that they are seen as one of the safest places you can put money. If bank saving accounts are covered by a government guarantee this will no longer be the case. As such they would be deemed to be less attractive, especially as they currently offer a return which is less than that of a top savings account.</p>"
