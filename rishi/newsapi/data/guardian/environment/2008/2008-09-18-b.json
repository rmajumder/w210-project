  "<p>Mariza has moved on. Portugal's theatrical young diva brought a new global audience to fado, but as a singer with links to both Africa and Brazil, it was inevitable she would begin to explore other influences. On her first set of new songs in three years, the classic guitar-based fado lineup is augmented not by strings, as on her last recordings, but by piano, drums, muted trumpet and extra guitars. Fado still dominates, but now has an international flavour. Pequenas Verdades, a brave duet with the earthy new Spanish star Buika, is driven on by flamenco guitar work from her Spanish producer Javier Lim\u00f3n; on Beijo de Saudade there's an easygoing burst of Cape Verdean morna, this time with Tito Paris helping out with the vocals. There are sections where she edges towards the mainstream, as on Vozes do Mar, which features Sting's impressive guitarist Dominic Miller. It's a sophisticated, classy set, and her voice is as subtle and dramatic as ever. All that's lacking is the spine-tingling emotion of Mariza at her best.</p>",
  "<p>The blue-and-gold Europe golf bag lettered with the name of Padraig Harrington stood alone at the side of the tee box, awaiting the start of the practice round. No caddies, no coaches, no players. Just the bag. It was there for 10 minutes, sending a silent message to the watching US spectators: your opponents include the winner of the last two major tournaments. Look on his works, you Yanks, and despair.</p> <p>\"There's Paw-drayg,\" said a young man wearing wraparound shades, JB Holmes-lookalike moustache-and-goatee combo and a \"US Embassy, Kabul, Afghanistan\" baseball cap. \"He can hit it a mile,\" he added to a friend after the players finally appeared, before taking a gulp from his plastic beer glass. \"He wins 'em all. He beats Americans! Dammit, we're gonna KICK. HIS. ASS.\" </p> <p>Mind games are the stuff of the Ryder Cup build-up, with every tiny piece of circumstantial evidence endlessly examined for its possible significance. The enforced absence of Tiger Woods, the world's No1 player, thrusts Harrington, noted for his modesty, into a position of pre-eminence: the one on whom all the others keep an eye. It remains to be seen whether Nick Faldo, Europe's captain, can make the most of such a player's presence in his team room, or whether Paul Azinger, his opposite number, will use the absence of Woods to get the rest of the United States players, veterans and rookies alike, to treat the added responsibility as a challenge.</p> <p>Faldo, who is hoping to celebrate a fourth European triumph in a row, looks back to his playing days and remembers the 1981 tournament at Walton Heath, where the crushingly victorious US team contained 11 men who had won majors. Now Azinger is the first American captain in Ryder Cup history to go into battle at the head of a team without a single player who has won a major during the year. The role of favourites, however, can be as burdensome as that of underdogs can be stimulating, and it looks very much as though the tournament will be won by the team whose leader can tune himself in to the internal dynamics of his line-up and elicit the greatest advantage from a complex range of perceptions and expectations.</p> <p>Never in the history of the Ryder Cup has the pre-tournament debate been so dominated by the personalities of the two captains. Their predecessors have often provoked mild debate but this time Faldo and Azinger have virtually monopolised the build-up. Big characters are essential to the dramatic interest of any competition and, in the absence of Woods, the media spotlight has switched away from the players and on to two near-contemporaries with entwined destinies - from their occasional bitter personal rivalry during their playing days to their apparently amicable partnership in the television commentary box.</p> <p>Azinger has had the easier job. His good humour covers the hint of an inferiority complex lingering from his playing days and the US media do not question the motives of an engaging man who, while in his mid-30s, got the better of cancer. His decision to send six rookies to face Europe is applauded as a brave recognition of the need to erase the memory of past defeats, and his tilting of the side towards a kind of blue-collar golfing ethic embodied by the big-hitting Holmes seems calculated to strike a chord with the crowd who will line the course today. Should he fail to lead the side to victory, the reaction will be one of disappointment rather than scorn.</p> <p>His adversary is batting on a very different wicket. For all his late-blooming bonhomie and the arrival in his vocabulary of a Boris Johnson-like set of expostulations, including \"Cripes!\", \"Crumbs!\" and \"Gosh!\", Faldo cannot escape a past in which his great career as a six-times major winner was seen to be founded on an ironclad solipsism. Those who were around during his playing years find it hard to accept that his pursuit of Ryder Cup captaincy - with the \u00a31m or so that it brings - was impelled by anything other than that same self-centredness.</p> <p>A man of his achievements and temperament will always find it hard to sit quietly in the background, and it was tempting to conclude that when he described the make-up of the ideal Ryder Cup player this week - \"big heart, strong in mind and strong in battle\" - he was basing his template on the attributes of the player who is closest to his own heart.</p> <p>Criticised for moulding the team to suit his own needs, he has been teased and tested by the representatives of the British media in the days leading up to the tournament, most obviously when a photographer took a picture of a piece of paper that appeared to contain his pairings for the opening foursomes. As he attempted to laugh it off, his clumsy sarcasm reminded listeners that he is at his least amusing when he is trying to be funny. </p> <p>There are those who believe that, aside from the business of making speeches and supervising the design of the players' uniforms, a Ryder Cup captain's influence is overstated, and the blossoming of the likes of Sergio Garc\u00eda and Lee Westwood in this environment certainly seems largely self-generated. But a bunch of individuals on one side or the other will need to perform to spectacular effect if, on Sunday night, the outcome of golf's premier team competition is not to be seen as the result of a straight fight between the minds and wills of two men whose strengths and weaknesses have been so thoroughly examined this week.</p>",
  "<p>The government will fail to meet its target of building 3m homes by 2020 unless ministers intervene further in the housing market, according to a report out today.</p> <p>The National Housing Federation warns that, without immediate action, only about 1.6m will be delivered by the deadline and that it could take until 2029 for the rest to be built.</p> <p>Federation chief executive David Orr said: \"With the global credit crunch worsening, and conditions getting tougher for all housebuilders, it is time to recognise the very commendable 2020 target is now almost impossible.</p> <p>\"The climate for housebuilding has changed beyond all recognition, for private developers and social house builders. The number of homes being built is falling, and we need the government to take further action.\"</p> <p>Private developers, which usually build some 75% of homes, have been badly hit by the property downturn. The Construction Products Association said recently the number of homes being built was at its lowest since 1945. </p> <p>Several big constructors are struggling in the credit crunch. Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey have seen their stockmarket values plunge 65% and about 80% respectively over the past year.</p> <p>Speaking at the federation's annual conference in Birmingham, Orr said that unless ministers intervened, the number of homes being built was likely to stay between 100,000 and 110,000 in the short term, and 160,000 in the long term. </p> <p>He said housing associations built 30,677 homes last year, but with the right level of government support this could reach 70,000 a year by 2011, boosting the chances of the target being met. </p> <p>But Orr warned that, with the cost of private finance rising, it was becoming tough for housing associations to raise the cash for building, privately and from their own resources. The federation wants the government to increase the grant available for each new housing association home to cover the private finance shortfall. </p> <p>A communities and local government spokesman said: \"We remain committed to our housing target as the right long-term goal, whilst recognising the scale of the challenge this entails. </p> <p>\"Only this month we announced a \u00a31bn package of support which will help first-time buyers, support vulnerable households at risk from repossession and deliver more affordable homes sooner, whilst helping the housebuilding industry.\"</p>",
  "<p>Business leaders including directors at Tesco, Lloyds TSB and other top high street names have urged Gordon Brown to drop his slowly, slowly approach to tackling global warming and go for \"transformational change\", saying the prime minister should not be held back by fears over the current financial crisis.</p> <p>But the involvement in the initiative of BAA, owner of Heathrow, and the energy firm E.ON angered environmentalists, who said the companies that encouraged flying and built coal-fired power stations showed \"hypocrisy of the purest strain\". </p> <p>A letter signed by some of the biggest figures in British business, to be sent today to Brown and to David Cameron and Nick Clegg, said the party leaders should work together urgently on measures such as higher energy efficiency standards, support for low-carbon technology and the auctioning of carbon allowances.</p> <p>The companies, all members of The Prince of Wales's Corporate Leaders Group on Climate Change, said they saw their own business opportunities in being at the head of a green revolution, but wanted regulatory certainty to help them plan their investments better.</p> <p>The letter said: \"Climate change poses global social, environmental and economic risks and demands a transformational change in how we manage our economy. Incremental change will not do. </p> <p>\"We have addressed this letter to the leaders of all political parties with representation in the houses of parliament with a view to encouraging a cross-political consensus on the scale and speed of change required, and a constructive</p> <p>political debate on how this can be achieved.\" The note was signed by Lucy Neville-Rolfe, director of corporate and legal affairs at Tesco, and Ian Cheshire, boss at B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher, but also Paul Golby, the chief executive of E.ON UK and Colin Matthews at BAA.</p> <p>Greenpeace said the signatures of the German-owned energy group and Spanish-owned airports operator were inappropriate. \"This is hypocrisy of the purest strain. It's astounding that E.ON would call for action on climate change when they're agitating to build Britain's first coal-fired power stations in decades. It makes an environmentalist's jaw drop to see the BAA logo on this letter when they're trying to expand airports across the nation,\" said Ben Stewart, the Greenpeace communications director.</p> <p>\"This is like Howard Marks calling for a crackdown on pot. If the executives of these companies want action on climate change they should immediately lock themselves in their boardrooms and not come out until Kingsnorth and Heathrow expansion have been dropped.\"</p> <p>The business group, coordinated by a Cambridge university programme for industry, said Brown should assume a legally binding deal on a 30% cut in greenhouse gas emissions will be signed at the 2009 United Nations climate change summit in Copenhagen.</p> <p>It tells political leaders problems in the financial markets and an economic slowdown cannot stand in the way of action on climate change. </p> <p>\"The global economic slowdown may cause some to question whether the UK can afford to act so boldly, but we believe action cannot be delayed, and furthermore that decisive action will stimulate economic activity and job creation in certain sectors,\" it said. </p> <p>Cheshire denied the letter implied the signatories did not believe the government was serious enough about climate change. </p> <p>\"No, its the reverse,\" he said. \"The government needs some space to implement change and we are showing our support for new measures.\"</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p>Business leaders calling for regulation could be viewed as turkeys voting for Christmas, but the primary aim of this initiative is to save themselves. Some of this is to do with reputation: it is good to be seen leading a green revolution when your customers accept climate change is of huge importance. But chief executives also hate uncertainty and find it difficult to make long-term investment decisions when they do not have a good idea of what the regulatory framework will look like. Business leaders are keen to win public money for experimental schemes such as carbon capture and storage, which has been linked with E.ON's proposed Kingsnorth coal-fired power station. They would also like public bodies to \"go green\", providing opportunities for business.</p>",
  "<p>Tate &amp; Lyle sounded another sour note yesterday when it said it was facing \"very difficult\" market conditions, had run into problems commissioning equipment at a corn mill in the US and was parting company with its finance director.</p> <p>Shares in the sugar and sweetener group fell 7% in early trading after it said \u00a315m would be shaved off its first-half profits by difficulties at the plant in Loudon, Tennessee, though management said this deficit would be made up by a stronger performance in other parts of the business.</p> <p>The chief financial officer, John Nicholas, is to leave at the end of this month and his role will be performed by investor relations director Tim Lodge, pending appointment of a permanent replacement. Nicholas has been finance chief since July 2006. The sugar sector continues to struggle against low prices inside the European Union at a time of soaring raw material and energy costs at its refineries.</p> <p>Iain Ferguson, the chief executive, put a brave face on Tate &amp; Lyle's performance in the past six months after a grim 2007. \"The group continues to trade satisfactorily. We expect profits from the group's continuing operations in the first half of the year, to September 30, to be broadly in line with the corresponding period in the prior year and our own expectations,\" he said.</p> <p>Volume growth of its sucralose sweetener, sold under the name Splenda, was strong in the first half but Tate &amp; Lyle saw less growth in value terms.</p> <p>The company admitted the general deterioration in global economic conditions, coupled with increased volatility in commodity prices, energy costs and exchange rates, made any statement about the outlook \"more than usually difficult\".</p> <p>Graham Jones, an analyst at stockbroker Panmure Gordon, said there was little to lift the gloom. \"John Nicholas's short and troubled tenure has come to an end but we doubt this will materially change sentiment in Tate,\" he wrote in a research note. Analysts at investment bank Citigroup were also downbeat. Eammon Ferry expressed \"concern\" at Tate &amp; Lyle's comments on the sugar and sucralose markets but remained hopeful the difficulties at Loudon could be quickly ironed out.</p> <p>The sugar group, which has come under fire from activist shareholders, said its new patented technology at the mill would bring considerable savings once fully up and running. The plant is operating at 75% capacity but additional equipment to be introduced next month would raise this to 85% in the third quarter of the financial year and 100% by next March.</p> <p>Tate &amp; Lyle warned a further \u00a310m to \u00a315m could be sliced off profits in the second half of the financial year as a result of the delays in Tennessee. But the experience gained there would be useful in ensuring a corn mill under construction at Fort Dodge, Iowa, meets expectations.</p> <p>The shares recovered ground during the day, closing down 1% or 4p at 396p.</p>",
  "<p>Capitalism is imploding with the credit crunch, just as communism fell with the Berlin Wall in 1989, with both systems morally bankrupt. Successive British governments have sold off public assets and utilities at knockdown prices, leaving us defenceless against massive energy price increases. Politicians have engineered a disastrous housing boom and bust, with parliament allowing Blair-Brown and Bush their murderous $5tn Iraq war. And now corporate socialism is being extended by Brown at vast taxpayer expense to the predatory city bankers whose only value is that \"greed is good\", even while the same bankers are destroying HBOS through speculative short selling. This is a defining historic moment, with the collapse of light-touch, laissez-faire turbo-capitalism. </p> <p>So how can we the people reassert democratic power over our elitist parliamentary shamocracy?

But how bad does the collapse of neoliberal capitalism have to get before you bring left analysis out of the features section into the mainstream of news and analysis? For example, what sort of team have you sent to the European Social Forum starting now in Malm\u00f6?<br><strong>Michael Edwards</strong><br>University College London </p> <p>Your various prominent leftwingers trot out the usual tired idea of capitalism having failed and it being \"socialism's turn\" (I seem to recall it had a \"turn\" across much of the world in the last century - how do they think that turned out?). To suggest that we can do without capitalism is clearly ridiculous; you can refuse to recognise or organise markets, but they will come into being wherever there is trade, of even the most modest kind. And the moment you have a market, you will have those who seek to take advantage of it.</p> <p>No, the problems of recent weeks have been caused by a simple lack of regulation, from both governments and the financial industry itself. The basis of power in a capitalist system should lie, unsurprisingly, with whoever has the capital. The trouble is that nobody bothered, until it was too late for most, to check whether AIG, Lehman Brothers et al could actually produce the capital they were playing with when their investors demanded it. Recent administrations on both sides of the Atlantic have trumpeted their deregulation of the financial industries - if they announced they were disbanding the police, would anybody be surprised when crime shot up? </p> <p>A healthy system depends on restoring and maintaining the balance between the industry's drive to make money for its investors, and the regulatory bodies making sure they do not run roughshod over the rest of us. I hope that recent events are enough to motivate us to (re)construct that system.<br><strong>Simon Dennis</strong><br>London </p> <p>I thoroughly agree with the Green New Deal group. A crash programme to make every UK building energy efficient is just what our planet needs.

  "<p>The public finances suffered yet another lurch into the red last month amid warnings of a record deficit this year that would force the next government to raise taxes or cut spending - or possibly both.</p> <p>The overall shortfall between tax revenues and spending was \u00a310.2bn in August - the worst figure for that month since such records began in 1993. Economists said the deficit could reach \u00a370bn this financial year, double the 2007/08 figure and way above the \u00a343bn estimate the chancellor, Alistair Darling, made in the budget in March.</p> <p>A deficit of \u00a370bn would easily exceed the previous record of \u00a351bn set by the Conservative government of Sir John Major in 1993. For the April to August period, the deficit was running \u00a312bn higher than in the same period last year - at \u00a328bn. </p> <p>The national debt figures lurched higher as the government's nationalisation of Northern Rock's \u00a387bn debt came onto the books for the first time, pushing debt up to 43.3% of national income, well above the government's self-imposed 40% ceiling.</p> <p>Excluding Northern Rock, the benchmark stood at 38.3%. The Treasury is reviewing its two main fiscal rules - the second being that tax should cover current spending over an economic cycle. Both are likely to be broken even if the impact of Northern Rock is removed.</p> <p>The government's problem will be exacerbated by the downturn in the economy. Figures out on Wednesday showed the biggest rise in unemployment for 16 years in August, which will push down income tax receipts and increase benefit payments, pushing the deficit out still further.</p> <p>The \u00a32.7bn cost of unwinding the 10p tax debacle, the postponement of fuel duty rises and the temporary scrapping of the starting rate of stamp duty for house purchases will all push up the deficit, as will the housing market collapse.</p> <p>This week's 4,500 job losses at Lehman Brothers, added to other City job losses, are particularly bad news for the public finances because bankers pay a lot of income tax, analysts pointed out.</p> <p>Jonathan Loynes of Capital Economics said: \"The state of the public finances continues to go from dreadful to even worse. If this rate of increase is sustained, borrowing will hit \u00a370bn this year.\"</p> <p>The figures show the government is struggling to control spending growth at a time when tax revenues are weakening.</p> <p>Andrew Goodwin, an economist at the Ernst &amp; Young Item Club, said: \"If recent trends are sustained, borrowing would reach \u00a364bn for the year as a whole. And with the economic outlook likely to worsen over the coming months there is a good chance that the out-turn could be even worse.\" </p> <p>Howard Archer, the chief UK and European economist at Global Insight, said the chancellor's predictions had been \"well and truly blown out of the water\".</p> <p>The shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Philip Hammond, said: \"Gordon Brown has built our economy on a mountain of public and private debt, leaving Britain poorly prepared in the face of the current economic crisis. His fiscal rules are now totally discredited. </p> <p>\"This is yet more evidence of why we need a new fiscal framework to bring the public finances back under control - and a new government to implement it.\"</p> <p>Yvette Cooper, chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \"Faced with unprecedented world shocks, it is right that we increase borrowing this year to help support the economy. </p> <p>\"We are cutting taxes by over \u00a34bn for low and middle income families, and maintaining public sector investment to help families and the economy through these tougher times.\"</p>",
  "<p>A man and a woman alleged to have worked around the clock dealing cocaine to clubbers in London's West End were arrested yesterday after a six-month police surveillance operation.</p> <p>Detectives believe the business - thought to be run by a 24-year-old man and his mother, who is in her 40s - operated 24 hours a day, supplying the drug almost anywhere within the M25 area. It is thought that the pair worked in shifts, with one of them always able to travel across the capital at short notice.</p> <p>In some cases they are alleged to have acted as wholesalers, selling large quantities of cocaine to other dealers who would target individual clubs.</p> <p>Officers from Scotland Yard's clubs and vice unit launched a series of raids, codenamed Fairsailing, early yesterday morning. The pair were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to supply class A drugs.</p> <p>Specialist officers searched their home in Camden, north London, for evidence of the illegal trade.</p> <p>A third man, in his 20s, was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to supply class A drugs after presenting himself at a central London police station, while a 48-year-old man was arrested on unrelated matters.</p> <p>Detective Superintendent Dave Eyles said: \"We believe that these three have been running a highly organised and highly profitable cocaine supply business. </p> <p>\"Our investigation has uncovered that the two worked a 'shift' system: one of them available to travel anywhere within the M25 to supply cocaine.</p> <p>\"Intelligence leads us to believe that the drugs are being bought by people using them as part of a night out clubbing or to sell on to others in that environment. They have been dealing within the M25 but, particularly, close to some of the well-known West End clubs. </p> <p>\"London has a world-recognised night-time economy.

  "<p>I have had a really jolly week. I know: weird or what? Frankly, if you saw anyone this week with a smile on their face, they had probably just been to a fashion show. While the rest of you have been watching gloomy-faced bankers on the news and wondering whether one of them siphoned off your pension into his 1998 bonus, leaving you to face penniless old age while he purrs into the sunset in the Jag he bought with your cash and whines about no longer having a driver, I have been looking at pretty clothes in lovely colours and listening to feelgood nostalgia classics, from the Jungle Book's I Wan'na Be Like You at Christopher Kane to LL Cool J's I Need Love at David David.</p> <p>The upbeat mood at London fashion week is all the more strange because last time around, in February, it could not have been more different. Then, the designers were into references such as medieval armour or witches or science-fiction horror. Sitting in the front row as the models came marching along, chainmail clanking menacingly against their jutting bones, I felt as if I was witnessing the onslaught of the horsemen of the apocalypse, only these ones travelled on platform spike-heeled gladiator boots rather than horses. Fashion seemed to be knuckling down for gloomy times ahead. But seven months later, in the very week that doom-mongering turned into reality, the mood was all smiles. </p> <p>If there is an overarching theme to be teased out of this week's shows, it is that this season, the mid-1980s to mid-1990s retro trend finally grew up and got wearable. Nostalgia for this era is nothing new in fashion - for the thirtysomethings currently populating London's design studios, these years were their teenage heyday. Hoxton clubbers have been dressing as if for a fashion shoot in a 1986 issue of The Face for years. But this week, the look took on a new commercial gloss. I suspect there is an element of escapism at play here. Now that they are stuck at work frowning over Excel spreadsheets, a generation is beginning to hone and polish its nostalgia for the days of Tetris games, acid house and Ray-Bans.</p> <p>Giles Deacon performed a radical about-turn from last season's portentous capes with a rainbow-coloured collection inspired by the Pacman obsession of his early teens and featuring a tongue-in-cheek double-G logo. Luella meshed 80s high society and pop culture: Tatler bows and pearls worn with Madonna-esque lace gloves and grey marl sweatshirting from the days when Pineapple dance studio was a hip hangout and yoga classes were for old hippies. Luella's cocktail dresses came in Tango orange, lipstick pink, candied violet - or, in some cases, all three. Richard Nicoll, Roksanda Ilincic and Sinha-Stanic all used brilliant colour in a clean, elegant way that somehow made teaming pink with orange or lime seem the height of chic. Temperley zeroed in on pink and electric blue, but orange was the unignorable colour of the season - from Christopher Kane's Flintstones-meets-Raquel Welch chiffon frocks to Jaeger and Betty Jackson's easy summer pieces to Amanda Wakeley's red-carpet looks. Natascha Stolle, a promising newcomer to the London schedule who scored a coveted spot on the Fashion East roster this season for her take-no-prisoners aesthetic of primary stripes against monochrome, was inspired \"by the 1980s glamour of her mother's Honolulu wardrobe\". </p> <p>The must-have shoes for next season? The slick purple patent Bayswater high-heeled loafers and mustard-yellow Roxanne sandals from Mulberry. (In her first collection, new Mulberry designer Emma Hill, alumna of Marc by Marc Jacobs and Gap, has given you shoes to match the spirit of your favourite Mulberry bag.) I think it's safe to say that colour is most definitely happening next summer. So much so, in fact, that even designers who remained aloof from the prevailing trend-silliness embraced colour. Now that bright orange and pink-with-lime are fashion-forward, the lemon-yellow that seemed so daring a year ago has become the summer colour of grown-ups: see the checked coatigan at Paul Smith and the mini-mac at Nicole Farhi. </p> <p>The right mood gets more style points than the right references, though. Louise Goldin, London's avant-garde knitwear star, seemed to mesh Tetris graphics with the Gaultier conical bras of Madonna's 1990 Blonde Ambition tour in this season's body-conscious dresses. And yet in a season that was all about clothes to make you smile, this collection felt a little too clinical. These are sexy dresses that could have been designed with latex gloves on: they lack a little human warmth. </p> <p>Topshop Unique had the right idea. In the past, this has sometimes been an oddly po-faced show, rather conceptual and serious and strangely at odds with the fashion-as-fun philosophy that Topshop is all about. This one brought to mind Kelly McGillis in Top Gun, and Madonna circa Like a Virgin - heart-print jumpsuits, aviators and wonky bows in the hair. Jumpsuits and playsuits will be completely unavoidable next year, from loose, dayglo and short at Marios Schwab to flowing, full-length bird-printed chiffon at Jaeger. The halterneck jumpsuit is next summer's maxidress, mark my words. </p> <p>The vintage-era Madonna influence made itself felt in another micro-trend: dresses on which integral bra-straps were a feature. At Louise Goldin's show, what looked like a dress from the front was a skirt and bra top from the back; at Richard Nicoll, coordinating silk bras were layered under racer-back vests. (Forensic fashion watchers will wonder whether the Sex and the City movie, in which Carrie wore a contrasting bra with a backless dress, played a role in this trend.)</p> <p>The bad news? Cycling shorts are back. But if we can smile through global financial meltdown, surely we can laugh in the face of lycra-clad thighs.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>All the latest news, reviews, gossip and pictures from the catwalks of the capital <a href=\"http://theguardian.com/fashion\">theguardian.com/fashion</a> Sign up to Fashion Statement, the Guardian's free new email service, for updates on fashion, catwalks and new trends, and the chance to win a trip to New York.</p> <p><a href=\"http://theguardian.com/fashionstatement\">theguardian.com/fashionstatement</a></p>",
  "<p>For Gordon Brown, the silver lining of the financial market implosion is massive and simple. The turmoil ensures that his leadership will not come under direct or sustained challenge at Labour's conference in Manchester next week. On the leadership question, Manchester will now offer a monumental study in collective hypocrisy, a connoisseur's display of untruth almost worthy of the annual conference of the North Korean Communist party. But it can't really last - and therefore it probably won't.</p> <p>The stories that have forecast a bruising Labour conference for the prime minister were always mainly that - stories. Labour is certainly in private despair - but it is not about to commit public suicide. Not only are revolts much harder to launch and carry through in this era of ruthlessly managed conferences, but there is no significant section of the Labour party that wants it to happen in Manchester. Those who do want it to happen think this is not the time. Many remain determined that it should not happen at all. The only person who stands to gain from mayhem in Manchester is Brown himself - a point worth bearing in mind. If you read something improbably disloyal over the weekend, ask yourself who benefits?</p> <p>On one level this rallying behind the Great Leader makes political sense. Even before the latest financial calamities, there was always a risk that another change of leader would turn the public even more solidly against Labour than it is already, especially when there is no pre-eminent replacement candidate. Now, as banks totter and assets plummet, a challenge to Brown risks looking out of touch, irresponsible, even frivolous. The political impact of the financial earthquake has barely made itself felt yet. After all, if this latest economic crunch frightens voters into demanding an experienced hand at the helm then - who knows? - we might even be on the verge of a Brown recovery. Or of a national government.</p> <p>On another level, though, there is no logic here at all. What happens if, instead of turning to Brown to get us out of these troubles, the voters turn on him for getting us into them? The financial institutions that have sacrificed savings, investments and pensions to pay for greedy speculations, dividends and bonuses are, after all, the exact same institutions that Brown himself licensed, lionised and let off the leash.</p> <p>By what logic, therefore, does this deregulator par excellence now claim to be the rectitudinous regulator, especially when his reputation for rectitude has taken such a massive hit over the 10p tax band abolition scandal? Yes, there is global turbulence, but the man who claims to be uniquely able to protect us from it is also the man who uniquely exposed us to it. He had a choice between strategies; he took one and rejected the other. There is no credit crunch taking place in Germany's more balanced mixed economy.</p> <p>Loyalty always plays well in any party, and those who recall the Tony Benn era remember the price that the wilful absence of it can entail for Labour. But loyalty to a lost cause can be idiotic not heroic, and if there are more polls like this week's Ipsos-Mori survey, placing the Conservatives on 52% and Labour on 24%, then loyalty may soon seem like foolish denial. In any case, why should anyone in the party owe much loyalty to the most consistently disloyal Labour politician of modern times? Imagine the vicious briefing that would be taking place this weekend if Blair not Brown had been in No 10.</p> <p>These are fluid and unpredictable times, and those who claim that Labour's course through them is clear are oversimplifying a situation of great complexity and considerable instability. Some political realities, though, have to be accommodated in any serious analysis. One is that Brown has been a dreadful leader, a man who promised change for the better and has delivered change for the worse. A second is that most Labour MPs and ministers - the people who really matter in this drama - hesitate to act. Their infirmity of purpose is a fact, in spite of the current drip-feed of individual revolts and resignations.</p> <p>A third reality is that while some cabinet ministers - Jack Straw, David Miliband, Alan Johnson, perhaps Ed Balls, and maybe Jacqui Smith (described to me this week as \"our Sarah Palin, the game-changer we need\") - may carry a field marshal's baton in their knapsacks, all of them hold back. A fourth is that Labour is heading for a wipe out of historic proportions unless something changes. Talk to Labour MPs and ministers and the one clear thing is that the prime minister's future is unclear. These are times in which witnesses to the same event give starkly different accounts. Tuesday's cabinet meeting is a case in point. Some who sat round the table attended a blunt, impatient and even defiant gathering, which challenged Brown's refusal to face up to Labour's unpopularity. Others felt they had taken part in a constructive, notably unrancorous, exchange of views about the political situation. </p> <p>For most Labour MPs, Brown remains a leader on probation. If there was a secret ballot on him today, he would be out. Since there is not, he has been allowed a relaunch, which has failed, a reshuffle, which has been postponed and which becomes increasingly complicated by his weakness, and a conference, which will support him with a show of unity. </p> <p>Whether Brown can rise to the occasion on Tuesday - he is a grim speechmaker - or whether it makes much difference remains to be seen. Five or six cabinet ministers, perhaps more, none of them plotters and none of them looking for Brown's job, are ready to quit if someone senior gives a lead. A possible moment for that comes if Labour loses the Glenrothes byelection, probably on November 6: \"It would be a disaster if we hold the seat,\" a senior Labour critic of the prime minister confessed this week.</p> <p>Brown has few rolls of the dice left. Yet the inertia factor still matters. Do nothing and things probably won't get any worse, terrible though they already are, many seem to feel. And then there's fear of the unknown. How would the markets, in their current febrile state, react to the ousting of a man of such governmental experience? Brown's chances of leading Labour into the next election are running out. But market turmoil has offered him a lifeline this week - and it may do so again. <br><a href=\"mailto:martin.kettle@theguardian.com\"><br>martin.kettle@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Have you ever queued for a toilet? Tried changing a baby's nappy on a park bench? Slid off the alleged \"seat\" at the bus stop (or failed to perch on it in the first place)? If so you are a victim of anti-women urban design. Research presented last month at the Royal Geography Society's annual conference found that our cities are still being designed for the benefit of men. The report, by Dr Gemma Burgess of Cambridge University, concluded that the vast majority of town planners are ignoring the gender equality planning regulations that were brought in last year. This is significant, because if public spaces were designed with women in mind, they would look entirely different, with much more lighting, better-situated car parks and more areas where residential and office spaces are mixed, making it far easier to juggle work and childcare.</p> <p>The report noted progress in some specific areas. In Lewisham, in south-east London, for example, says Burgess, \"They asked themselves, 'Where have we decided to build new office blocks?' They realised that where they were located was no good for anyone wanting to combine work and home, so now they are thinking: 'Where can we get mixed development to make it easier for those people?'\" Another local authority, in South Yorkshire, organised a series of walkabout tours with architects and local women, whose views were written into planning briefs.</p> <p>There is something of a buzz around this subject. In July the Women's Design Service (WDS) launched Gendersite, the world's largest database on gender and the built environment, and on October 2 an all-day Gendersite event at Queen Mary University will feature an exhibition of work by women architects. The speaker will be Ruth Reed, who was elected the first woman president of the Royal Institute of British Architects in July; the current president of the Royal Town Planning Institute is also a woman, Janet O'Neill.</p> <p>The WDS publishes such mind-boggingly fascinating titles as At Women's Convenience: A Handbook on the Design of Public Women's Toilets, and celebrated its 20th anniversary last year, having been founded by a group of women architects, designers and planners in 1987. \"Most of the things in our built environment are designed on a male model,\" says Wendy Davis, director of the WDS, before noting, \"There are differences between men and women in terms of ergonomics. Women are generally smaller, they have less reach, they are less strong.\" But designs that are hostile - or useless - to women still make it through. As an example, Davis cites the recent removal of seats from train stations because of fears of vandalism. \"They have been replaced with sloping shelves at the height of a 6ft 6in man's bottom. By and large things are designed to accommodate men's bodies. They don't take account of all the issues around the fact that we're the ones who menstruate, get pregnant, need to breastfeed.\"</p> <p>Which brings us neatly to the subject of toilets. Almost all public spaces still accord the same number of square metres to male and female toilets, and because women can't use urinals, they end up with half as many toilets in the allocated space. So why not double the allocation? \"If you want to know the true position of women in society look at the queue for the ladies' loo,\" says Clara Greed, professor of inclusive urban planning at the University of the West of England.</p> <p>The urban planning concepts that affect women most are predictable: creches, housing design, parks, pavements, safety and transport. Burgess points out that 75% of bus journeys are taken by women and only 30% of women have access to a car during the day, but urban schemes are designed around car drivers and commuters. Many of the problems of urban planning simply reflect women's domestic inequality: the fact that women still do the bulk of childcare, looking after the elderly, shopping and cleaning. \"Women are less likely to have a simple journey to work like men,\" says Greed, \"They break up their journey, stop off at the childminder, school and then work and maybe the shops and school on the way back. Public transport favours the male commute in and out of the city centre.\"</p> <p>It is disturbing, when you start to think about it, that women simply accept the physical and geographical limitations placed on them in everyday life. \"You are used to it being uncomfortable,\" says Eeva Berglund, a social anthropologist and author of Doing Things Differently, a history of the Women's Design Service. \"One of the major issues is the way that women restrict their lives. You choose where you go and where you don't go and you come to find that acceptable.\"</p> <p>This chills me slightly as I remember the times I have excluded myself from shops, offices, public transport options, arts events and restaurants because I have a buggy with me, because I am carrying a baby who will need breastfeeding or have various children in tow who won't make it up all the steps. When I first had a baby I noticed this and found it annoying. Now, like a Stepford Wife automaton, I accept it. And I never sit on those sloping shelves at bus stops or stations because they are at a weird height.</p> <p>But how can we change all these things? Above all, it is about architects, whether male or female, being open to these issues. More women in the industry would help too, because at least some of them would design in their own image. \"Designers see themselves at the end of their pencil - or their mouse,\" says Davis. \"Until about 15 years ago most architects and planners were men. They saw themselves moving through this environment. Because they were men and they were car drivers, they were interested in keeping commuters moving. It's the same issue as with disability. They didn't understand how a 15mm lip on a kerb could upset a buggy or a wheelchair. Not that they were being sexist - it just didn't occur to them.\"</p> <p>Burgess argues that, despite the failings revealed in her report, there has been some significant progress. \"There are massive new developments planned for the next decade and there is a lot of potential for getting things right,\" she says. Others are more sceptical. \"Most of the planners and urban decision-makers are still men,\" says Greed, \"Do they care? Is anything happening? Not a lot. Gender has a low priority, but what is good for women is good for everyone. It will create better cities for all.\"</p>",
  "<p>For a growing number of office workers fluorescent lighting and clunky air-conditioning are fast becoming distant memories, as employers realise that not only is a well-designed working environment essential to attract and retain staff, it also reflects how an organisation is perceived by the outside world.</p> <p>This weekend, thanks to an initiative called <a href=\"http://www.openhouse.org.uk/public/london/event.html\">Open House London</a>, more than 650 London buildings will be open to the public, many of which are office spaces. Some, such as the foyer of 120 Fleet Street, formerly the Daily Express building and considered to be one of the best examples of British art deco, are of historic interest, while others demonstrate that a bold, beautiful building can also be a practical and efficient workplace. </p> <h2>A bit of a shock</h2> <p>The surface of the striking Blue Fin building in Southwark, home to IPC Media, is covered by 2,000 aluminium blue fins that not only change and shimmer throughout the day, but keep the building cool. </p> <p>\"Each office around the perimeter of the building has one of these fins outside the window, so it's a significant part of people's daily experience,\" says Alex Wraight, associate director of architect <a href=\"http://www.alliesandmorrison.com/\">Allies and Morrison</a>. \"They give the building an identity and focus, which is important in a large organisation.\"</p> <p>The fa\u00e7ade is all glass, as are most of the internal walls, which means that although the building is flooded with light, there is very little privacy. \"That was a bit of a shock at first,\" says Claudia Lopes, PA to a director of the weekly titles. \"But everyone is much more accessible now, which is way more important than having privacy. But you do have to keep your desk tidy.\" </p> <p>Open plan spaces are flexible and make it easier to communicate with colleagues, but in the past, unless you happened to be by a window, you might not see a ray of natural light all day. Thankfully architects are finding ingenious ways of getting round this. </p> <h2>Change of scene</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337720368\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2008/09/17/10-queen-street220.jpg\" alt=\"Open House: 10 Queen Street\" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">10 Queen Street Place</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Law firm S J Berwin is based in 10 Queen Street Place, SE1. \"The original building was constructed during the financial boom in the 1980s with a vast football pitch space suitable for City traders,\" says Festus Moffatt from <a href=\"http://www.jra.co.uk/\">John Robertson Architects</a>. \"Fifteen years later it was obsolete and we had to find a way of turning it into a modern office that people could work in for another 25 years.\"</p> <p>Interestingly the decision was made not to string a row of offices around the edge of the building, which would inevitably be occupied by lawyers and leave the ancillary staff stuck in the middle with no natural light, but to bring the offices into the middle and create a boulevard around the perimeter of the building so that everyone had access to daylight. </p> <p>\"It's fabulous. Everyone really seems to walk around with a bit more of a spring in their step,\" says PA Gerry Thompson. \"We also have a wonderful roof terrace with unparalleled views of the river where we have social functions, and as Wi-Fi is available throughout the building lawyers can escape with their laptops if they feel they need for a change of scene.\" </p> <h2>Local impact</h2> <p>The Willis building is a spectacular 28-storey building in the heart of the City of London. \"We used to be in a very traditional building and this is a much more conducive working environment,\" says Grant Corrigan, executive director of facilities management for the Willis Group. \"Quite apart from it being lighter and more spacious we have far better communication facilities such as Wi-Fi and an auditorium.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337720369\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2008/09/17/Willis-Building220.jpg\" alt=\"Open House: The Willis Building\" width=\"220\" height=\"450\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Willis building.

The Inland Revenue centre in Nottingham was a pioneering \"green\" project in the UK when it was completed in 1984. It is comprised of seven separate buildings, all naturally ventilated. \"Linking into the city district heating system as well as the city streetscape by a network of publicly accessible streets, it immediately became a 'good neighbour' to the community around it,\" says Bill Taylor, a partner at Hopkins Architects who designed the building. </p> <p>Revenue employee Andrea Molver-Hunt says she enjoys working in the building, but it does have some quirks - such as the blinds automatically closing at 6 o'clock at night. </p> <p>Environmental sustainability, along with long-term employee relations, were of crucial importance to Wessex Water when it moved to a new building overlooking the rolling countryside just outside Bath. All the rock that was dug up when it was built was crushed and used for the perimeter walls. The car park was designed around the trees rather than cutting them down, and has porous paving so the water drains into tanks to be recycled. And not surprisingly staff are encouraged not to drink bottled water.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337755669\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2008/09/18/WessexWater220.jpg\" alt=\"Wessex Water\" width=\"220\" height=\"220\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Control room, Wessex Water</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bennetts</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\"Our old offices seem really old-fashioned now,\" says Lisa Hobbs, PA to the chairman. \"I used to be tucked away in the chairman's suite, which was very isolating, but now the whole company is open-plan.

  "<p>Surfers who ride waves through areas reserved for swimmers off a Cornish beach could be taken to court and issued with antisocial behaviour orders, it emerged yesterday. </p> <p>Lifeguards at Sennen beach, near Land's End, are so fed up with rogue surfers who refuse to follow the rules that they have turned to the police for help. </p> <p>Police are now considering sending a community support officer to patrol the beach and perhaps even the use of asbos to control the surfers. </p> <p>The beach at Sennen is popular with surfers but has a no-go area which is reserved for people, including many families, who use it for swimming. Lifeguards employed by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution patrol the beach but have no powers to enforce the rules. They have asked the police to help them next summer after a series of incidents in which surfers cut through the bathing zone and almost injured swimmers. </p> <p>Devon and Cornwall police have a project called Beach Beat at St Ives, Newquay and Perranporth in Cornwall, where they have worked with the RNLI to try to cut drinking and antisocial behaviour. </p> <p>There are no current plans to formally extend Beach Beat to Sennen, but an officer could be drafted in to patrol the beach next summer if the problems persist. </p> <p>Local constable Andrew Tonkin said: \"The RNLI lifeguards have logged quite a few problems with surfers recently. There have been particular problems with longboarders whose refusal to use leashes could cause injury to swimmers.\" A leash connects the surfer's ankle to the board and stops it zipping off in a fall. </p> <p>Tonkin said an officer on the beach could monitor surfers' behaviour and, if necessary, intervene. </p> <p>A police spokesman said the Beach Beat project was intended to make the environment safer for all users. He said: \"The idea is to provide a high-visibility uniform presence on the beach.\"</p> <p>The RNLI said it had a problem with a few surfers at Sennen. A spokeswoman said: \"Our lifeguards cannot enforce the bylaws. Their remit is to advise.\" </p> <p>Surfer Sam Bleakly said: \"The idea is narrow-minded. It is unsustainable to pay police to patrol the beach when we already have very qualified RNLI lifeguards. </p> <p>\"Surfers are famous for being rebels. It is part of the identity of the sport and the extra bureaucracy will only create strife.\"</p>",
  "<p>There has been a 150% increase in the volumes of carbon trading on the European Climate Exchange in the first six months of the year and its boss predicted there would be further growth despite a global economic slowdown.</p> <p>Shares in the parent company - UK-based Climate Exchange - briefly added to this week's falls in early trading yesterday amid widespread concern that the company's rapid growth cannot be sustained in a world hit by the credit crunch. The group published a first half pre-tax loss of \u00a3304,000, well down from the \u00a32.8m deficit it ran up in the same period in 2007, while operating revenues nearly doubled to \u00a310.5m. \"We've had a great first half. I'm pretty bullish about the foreseeable future,\" said Neil Eckert, chief executive, who said he had seen no slowdown in business. </p> <p>Climate Exchange owns and operates a carbon bourse in Europe, ECX, and Chicago while also having joint ventures in China, India, and Japan. Shares in the parent group fell almost 45% from a three month high of \u00a320.41 in August, and analysts have expressed concerns about the company's rapid growth. Yesterday the shares turned up after an early 1.5% fall. By the close they had risen 70p to \u00a312. </p> <p>\"Climate Exchange has been growing like stink, but there are a lot of ifs [surrounding emissions trading] and this staggering valuation takes some justification,\" one analyst said. </p> <p>\"Volumes have been strong and we have no exposure to sub-prime,\" Eckert said, referring to the mortgage-related debt that has led to a meltdown in the global financial markets. </p> <p>Average monthly volumes for European Union allowances, credits traded under the EU's emissions trading scheme, almost doubled to 167.3m, representing 88% of all such exchange-traded volumes in Europe. Volumes for CERs, the UN-issued emissions offsets generated by clean energy projects in developing countries, averaged 47.2m per month since being launched by the ECX in March, or 84% of all European exchange-traded volumes. \"Ironically, the one time you really need an exchange is when credit is so frightening,\" said Eckert in reference to the global financial crisis. </p> <p>The Climate Exchange boss was most excited by China's emissions trading plans, saying Climate Exchange was the only western bourse with a shareholding in an exchange in China. In July, Climate Exchange announced a pact with Chinese National Petroleum Corporation Asset Management and the city of Tianjin to launch a new trading platform. \"China's going to be the biggest market ... it'll take a while for them to do it, but once they do it will be a monster,\" Eckert said.</p>",
  "<p>The world's leading central banks tried again to ease the growing stress in the world's money markets yesterday with coordinated action to provide $180bn (\u00a3100bn) in extra liquidity.</p> <p>The US Federal Reserve announced that the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, the Swiss National Bank and the Bank of Canada would provide extra funding. </p> <p>The collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers, the takeover of Merrill Lynch and the nationalisation of the United States insurance giant AIG this week has made banks unwilling to lend to each other, leading to an acute shortage of funds in dollar markets.</p> <p>Banks need dollars to keep trading so the Fed, in effect, lent other central banks huge amounts of the currency so that they could pump extra liquidity into markets in Europe, Asia and North America.</p> <p>Cash-strapped commercial banks scrambled to take up the money and, for a while at least, the move seemed to do the trick, as overnight inter-bank lending rates in London, known as Libor, fell back in the daily fixing announced late morning. However, the interest rate for three-month dollar funds rose to its highest since January as banks still refused to lend money to each other longer than overnight. But while stockmarkets rose for a while on the news, the rally later petered out and analysts warned that any relief could be brief.</p> <p>\"Funding had to be added ... but will it encourage lending and an end to the ossification of the money market? Until that happens in all major markets we will be locked into a market as unpredictable as a rabid hound,\" warned Stephen Pope, a strategist at broker Cantor Fitzgerald.</p> <p>The Fed said in a statement that the move was \"designed to address the continued elevated pressures in US dollar short-term funding markets.\" </p> <p>It added: \"These measures, together with other actions taken in the last few days by individual central banks, are designed to improve the liquidity conditions in global financial markets. The central banks continue to work together closely and will take appropriate steps to address the ongoing pressures.\"</p> <p>The Bank of England is making $40bn available, with the ECB increasing its funding by $55bn and the Swiss National Bank offering $15bn. The Bank of Japan will lend $60bn; the Bank of Canada $10bn.</p> <p>In a separate response to the crisis, Russia's president, Dmitry Medvedev said the country would spend up to 500bn roubles (\u00a310.9bn) to stabilise its market.

  "<p>Graham Birse, deputy head of the chamber of commerce, summed up a funereal mood in Edinburgh yesterday: \"There is a sense of losing part of our heritage, a sentimental sense of loss.\"</p> <p>The overnight sale of the Scottish capital's fifth largest employer has been a violent shock to the city's confidence. The growth of HBOS into Britain's fifth largest bank had helped insulate Edinburgh and Scotland from the worst of the global downturn. The city's famously high house prices only stopped growing last month, while its unemployment level is among the UK's lowest: Scotland last month recorded a 4.2% jobless rate, versus 5.5% at UK level, thanks to its \u00a3600bn financial sector.</p> <p>Edinburgh's two banks - the Bank of Scotland and its brasher rival RBS - are woven into the city's psyche. The Royal Mile's skyline is punctuated by its three great civic institutions: the military fortress on Castle Rock, the sharp spires of the Church of Scotland's general assembly and the bank's imposing baronial headquarters on the Mound. The 200-year-old building was reduced to a largely symbolic role as the bank's corporate headquarters during its expansion from a respected national bank, founded 313 years ago, to a global financial force. It will now become just a regional headquarters. </p> <p>Graeme Combe, 53, a civil servant and HBOS customer, said the bank's sale would have \"a major impact\" on the city and the wider area. \"My initial reaction was disappointment, but I would much rather have a change of name than have no bank at all.\" </p> <p>Birse fears the closure of HBOS's global headquarters in Edinburgh - the group's corporate offices are currently spread across 16 sites in the city - will significantly affect the wider economy. </p> <p>Across Scotland, lawyers, architects, printers and office servicing companies will suffer losses. HBOS employs 6,459 people in the city - the merged group says that management focus is to keep jobs in Scotland.</p> <p>Edinburgh's city airport had been planning to expand to cope with the surge of corporate executives flying in from Frankfurt, London, Paris and Geneva to broker deals with HBOS and RBS, which is headquartered on a vast new campus within sight of the runway.</p> <p>The City of Edinburgh council may now have a vast new site to fill. In May, HBOS announced that it was to build a new global HQ building for \u00a3100m in Fountainbridge, just west of the city centre, for all its employees. That plot is now likely to be put up for sale by Lloyds-Halifax, as are around a third of the new combined bank's local branches. \"We have to be wary that as much of influence and corporate wealth of the Bank of Scotland is retained in Scotland as possible,\" Birse added. </p> <p>Edinburgh's arts scene also faces a period of unexpected austerity. Both HBOS and Lloyds-TSB - a bank itself created by the merger of Lloyds with another Scottish financial institution, the Trustee Savings Bank - are \"essential players\" in sponsoring the city's international festival, theatre and art galleries.</p> <p>The fear is that Lloyds-Halifax will slash its arts funding in parallel with its branches. \"The festival will be concerned because the contribution from both banks is significant,\" said one senior figure in Edinburgh's arts scene.</p>",
  "<p>I have just done the shopping at one of our local supermarkets in the Tarn region of France. At the entrance to the Leclerc car park in Gaillac there is a McDonald's. Today it looked full. It looked full the last time I drove past too, with cars queueing at the outside takeaway hatch. McDonald's. In France. Full. Listen to many politicians and anti-globalisation campaigners in France, and the fast-food choices that so many French families make are collective acts of culinary treason. At the very least, in a country where restaurants serve snails, fast food is clearly culturally aberrant. Much more than that, however, McDonald's represents to these critics all that is worst in globalisation: indeed, it represents all that is worst, full stop. It stands for big, brutal, unethical business, for US imperialism, for environmental despoliation, for loss of jobs and local identity, for the rape of familiar terroir, for the further impoverishment of the downtrodden, and so on ... and on and on. The world is a bad place run by neoliberal ideologues. The state has been overthrown by roistering banks and grasping multinationals. </p> <p>All of which would be more convincing if the French themselves weren't such effective globalists. French businesses are globally very successful. Carrefour comes second only to Wal-Mart in size as a mass-market retailer. Louis Vuitton Mo\u00ebt Hennessy owns New Zealand's Cloudy Bay wine. How's that for respect of <em>terroir</em>?</p> <p>As a colonial power, France inculcated its territories with Frenchness - the food, the language, the education, the urban planning. In parts of Hanoi even today, there is a thoroughly French feel with its squares and boulevards. The croissant is as widely travelled as the burger. So it is not commercial or cultural imperialism that the French political class abhors, but the stamp not bearing the words \"Made in France\". </p> <p>But perhaps it's unfair to single out the French for their ability to demonise certain manifestations of the free flow in people, business and culture while happily accepting others. The anti-globalisation movement, in its many forms, is a tangle of incompatible attitudes. The romantic right argues that globalisation destroys community, erodes custom, and brings lots of strange people into our country - wherever it may be - who eat the wrong food, worship the wrong gods, speak the wrong language and cannot be trusted to root for the national team. The romantic left argues that globalisation makes the strong stronger and the weak weaker, undermining individual freedoms by chipping away at the welfare state in the developed world, leaving individuals everywhere exposed to the remorseless exploitative force of capital. What both groups share is their opposition to liberal principles that open up countries to do more business with one another, while governments allow markets to operate with the minimum of interference under the rule of law. </p> <p>With international banks failing and stock markets crashing, this is not the easiest of times to make the case for globalisation. Yet this is a cause that is worth fighting for. Those who defend globalisation stake out the territory of liberalism, the liberalism of free choice and expression, the liberalism that believes that individuals will usually make sensible choices within an open market that benefit both themselves and their societies. Globalisation is ultimately about choices exercised on a global level: economic choices, lifestyle choices and identity choices. </p> <p>What defines the anti-globalisation radicals, by contrast, is an extraordinary lack of faith in human beings. The movement of people from one country to another will apparently destroy national cohesion and integrity. Individuals will be ground down, along with their local identity, by an impersonal global capitalist machine. Consumer choice will be distorted by and subjugated to the marketing of brands. The \"comparative advantage\" of poverty will lead to the export of jobs from rich countries, impoverishing white-collar as well as blue-collar workers. </p> <p>Globalisation is something \"out there\", a pitiless, inexorable process, or else a shadowy, threatening conspiracy. The irony of anti-globalisation, even at the extremes of ecological Druidism, Islamic radicalism, skinhead isolationism or Marxist irredentism, is that all the activists are more than happy to use the means of globalisation - cheap air fares, internet communication, blogging, money transfers - even as they damn them. I once saw someone at a demonstration in London holding a poster announcing the presence of \"The World-Wide Movement against Globalisation\". </p> <p>This may be one of the ironies of globalisation, that the foundation of a truly global civil society will begin in the organisations and charities of the anti-globalisation movement. They can certainly use the technologies and methods of globalisation to try to change the choices people make. For all the talk about powerlessness, those who reject globalisation have the power to shut it down if they build up a sufficiently large critical mass, if they are able to put themselves in control of the right levers of power. It is salutary to remember that those who came so close in Europe to shattering belief in democracy and the values of reason and liberalism in the 1930s and 40s began life as bands of extremists. Lenin, Stalin and Hitler all rose out of the wreckage of liberalism. </p> <p>Extremism is not the only \"ism\" that we need to worry about among the anti-globalists. There is also much ill-informed anti-Americanism. As Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye point out in Governance in a Globalising World, \"Globalism is not intrinsically American, even if its current phase is heavily influenced by what happens in the United States.\"</p> <p>We should beware, in other words, of overstating the case that global civilisation is American civilisation. David Beckham may be a global sporting superstar, known from Birmingham to Beijing to Borneo, but in Baltimore he is \"David who?\" The Italian culinary magazine Gambero Rosso asserts that while there may be 17,000 McDonald's outside the US, there are 54,000 decent Italian restaurants outside Italy. Even those loathed symbols of American cultural expansion, the hamburger and the frankfurter, testify to earlier German influence. </p> <p>What the US does contribute is as much a distinctive and successfully competitive way of doing things as a distinctive civilisation: how to combine, for instance, several cuisines on a miniature assembly line (miniature, so that it can be called handmade), operating from a corner franchise, financed by a multinational corporation that also handles strategy and advertising, while outsourcing cleaning to the lowest bidder and data entry to a firm in Mumbai. Such is the genius of the US. The export of the McDonald's model is a much greater component of globalisation than the export of actual McDonald's, while the uptake of both the model and the McDonald's is about choice within the free market. There is nothing imposed or imperial about this aspect of American culture, any more than there is in the spread of Italian restaurants. Neither the burger nor pasta manifests a colonial hegemony. </p> <p>The greatest threat to globalisation comes from the rich and powerful states failing to make the corrections in the system that would benefit all. Better government and different policies, for example, would have prevented the mortgage crisis and the resulting credit crunch. What created mayhem in the financial markets was not the inherent weakness of globalisation but the greedy incompetence of the banks and other credit institutions, whose precise level of exposure to bad debts seemed sometimes to be obfuscated by the technology they employed. I remember a banker once trying to explain to me how the mortgage of, say, an unemployed single parent in St Louis could be morphed into a triple-A rated financial investment in London, New York or Paris. Magically, impoverishment became a \"special investment vehicle\". Try as hard as the banker did to get me to comprehend the beautiful simplicities of the whole process, I remained baffled. It was, I suppose, some sort of relief later on to discover that it was not me who was stupid. </p> <p>Governments, central banks and other regulators do not want to react too heavy-handedly to the crash. They can hope not only that in the short term American and European banks will be bailed out by Middle East and Asian investors, but that growth in Asia will help avoid a global economic crash. Some changes, however, will have to be made. Regulators need to take a beady look at the way banks pay their staff: the bonus culture needs to change. It is not self-evidently in the interests of the shareholders who own a bank that its executives are paid more for taking ever greater risks. Bank lending should also be constrained during periods when asset prices are booming - when the froth is piling up.</p> <p>We must not, however, allow the current turmoil in the financial markets to blind us to what globalisation has achieved, above all for developing countries. The growth in world trade in the last century was substantial. It doubled as a proportion of world output in that period. More trade means more economic activity, more jobs, more investment and more prosperity. By the last decade, a quarter to a third of the growth in trade was between the 60,000 multinational corporations and their 820,000 foreign subsidiaries. In less than four decades, the exports of manufactured goods from developing to developed countries rose 12-fold.</p> <p>Most of the international investment by rich countries - the members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development - goes to about 30 newly industrialising economies. As a result Sao Paolo, for example, has been described as one of Germany's largest industrial cities, home to more German industrial firms than any other foreign city in the world. </p> <p>Increases in trade and investment have triggered growth that has lifted unprecedented numbers of people out of poverty, especially in Asia. The number of people in east Asia in extreme poverty (that is, living on less than a dollar a day) fell during the 1990s from 486 million to 275 million; in China itself the decline was from 376 million to 222 million.</p> <p>Globalisation, then, has not been an impoverishing conspiracy by the rich against the poor. If it has not helped every country, that is because some countries have excluded themselves by accident or design from the whole liberal project, some have been excluded by its imperfections, and others still have governments too weak or incompetent to take advantage of it. </p> <p>India, for example, would be much more prosperous if reform had been pushed further and faster. As it is, that country's fractured political system has made it particularly easy for interest groups to block radical changes in public spending. It is generally reckoned that 10% of India's GDP - roughly 40% of all public spending - goes into subsidies to cut the food, water and power bills of the relatively prosperous. </p> <p>Within the US and Europe, hostility to free trade is on the rise, largely because it is seen as a threat to jobs and livelihoods. Switch on Lou Dobbs' news programme on CNN and you hear about the hollowing-out of the American middle class. Not only have blue-collar workers lost their jobs to foreign competition, but now white-collar jobs are threatened mainly by outsourcing. Moreover, while all this is happening, immigrants are allegedly streaming into the US, partly at the behest of big business, to keep the labour market weak. Figures for the first quarter of 2004, however, suggested that less than 2% of layoffs in the US were the result of relocation overseas. A survey for McKinsey showed that every dollar spent on outsourcing in India led to a larger benefit back home. Others suggest that jobs are not on the whole lost to India or China - they disappear because technologies change. Protectionism is invariably about protecting the losers from this process, pinning labour down in low value-added, low-paid jobs at a high cost to consumers and taxpayers.</p> <p>This is not how it seems, of course, nor how it is portrayed. The result is that globalisation is viewed a lot more favourably in poor countries than in rich ones. A survey for the Financial Times in July 2007, measuring views on globalisation in the US and Europe, showed that in none of these countries was it believed that globalisation had a more positive than negative effect. In Spain, Britain and the US less than a fifth of respondents thought that globalisation had been beneficial to them; they were plainly affected by resentment at growing income disparities and low regard for company bosses. That, someone should have pointed out, is the result not of rampant globalisation but of poor domestic government. A chief executive in Japan typically earns 11 times as much as one of his average workers; his typical American counterpart earns 170 times as much. You do not have to be a socialist to regard this as pretty grotesque.</p> <p>The growing protectionist sentiment in the US and Europe is particularly noisome because it reeks of so much hypocrisy. We preach free trade to the poor while shutting their own goods out of our markets, or slapping prohibitive tariffs on them. The most notorious examples of this are in agriculture. I was privy to the row at a European Council meeting in 2002 when Tony Blair and Jacques Chirac went head-to-head over the impact of agricultural protectionism on poor African countries. In response to a rather mild critique by Blair of the disjuncture between French expressions of concern about the poverty in sub-Saharan Africa and French support for agricultural protectionism, Chirac blew a Gallic gasket. Presidential rage was excited by the observation, as it were, that the vicar was committing adultery behind the presbytery. But the story about agricultural protection in the US, Europe and Japan is true. At the beginning of the new century the EU provided in subsidies more than 100 times as much money for each Union cow as for each sub-Saharan African human being - $913 in contrast to $8. Japanese cows enjoyed an even bigger, almost 2,000-fold advantage. Subsidies in rich countries, which invariably go to the better-off farmers, disrupt global markets and cut back the exporting prospects of poor farmers in poor countries. As Martin Wolf noted in his book Why Globalisation Works, the world's least-developed countries face tariffs that are four to five times higher than those faced by the richest economies.</p> <p>European politicians talk more and more about protecting their industries against Asian competition, and occasionally do so. The debate in the US, however, is much louder and more aggressive. Americans have already used spurious security arguments to block the sale of six port-management businesses in the country to a Dubai-based company. Opponents of the deal in 2006 included senators John Kerry and Hillary Clinton. There is growing protectionist sentiment even in those parts of the Democratic party that piloted the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) through Congress. There is a general feeling, especially in Asia, that a change of administration in Washington should bring a more sensitive multilateral approach to security issues, but might lead also to a ham-fisted and unilateralist policy on international economic affairs. American politicians might recall the impact of the protectionist Smoot-Hawley legislation in 1930, which helped to tip the US and the world over the edge into depression and a slump in world trade. </p> <p>The increase in the number of multinational corporations, which account for more than 20% of world production and 70% of world trade, has not, surprisingly, attracted the wrath of the anti-globalisation movement. This has been aggravated by the growth of investment instruments such as hedge funds and private equity companies. Private equity companies now employ through their investments in Europe about the same number of people as the population of the Netherlands. There are serious issues about the role of these new financial instruments, touching on transparency, the taxation of profits, the driving down in the past of the price of risk and the driving up of the amount of credit in the marketplace. But these questions, which ignore the fact that the main investors in these vehicles tend to be the organisations that manage pensions for you and me, do not really add to or subtract from the rage about big capitalism. </p> <p>Part of the argument against capitalism is unanswerable. Money often confers power - market power, political power. Is life fair? No. Have collective attempts to make it more fair been successful? No - unless equality of misery and oppression is regarded as desirable. Can the rich enjoy themselves more than the rest of us? Well, they can spend more money, that's for sure, but quite why they choose to do this in places such as Monte Carlo has always puzzled me. Can a lower tax bill ever make it worth living somewhere so expensively tacky? Yet it is not simply envy and resentment about money that drags the corporate world into the centre of the debate about globalisation. After all, there would be rich people even if we lived in a world where there was widescale protectionism, and as we saw in China and the Soviet Union, socialism often generates both poverty and extreme inequality. </p> <p>The two other charges that need to be answered are, first, that globalisation leads to a race to the bottom in the conditions of workers and environmental quality and regulation and, second, that the economics of globalisation threaten the end of the nation-state. Concern about the race to the bottom was not the reason for labour unions joining the demonstrations in Seattle. They were not concerned principally about the conditions experienced by workers in poor countries. They wanted to protect their own jobs in a rich country. Wages are lower and working conditions usually worse in poor countries. Growth raises pay levels and improves conditions. There is scant evidence that wages are driven down by multinationals, nor that they help perpetuate indefinitely bad working conditions. As growth accelerates, child labour falls. Any multinational, if it is sensible, will try to ensure that its factories everywhere meet high standards, something that makes good business sense, not least since the consumers and the workforce in their countries of origin increasingly demand it. While there are many things wrong with China, it is not obvious that the lack of a strong trade union movement is the biggest of them. Strong trade unions would represent a welcome development of civil society in that country, but they might also have held back economic development, as has happened in India. Trade unions there have been all too effective in imposing conditions on governments and employers that inhibit growth and give too many people the privilege of continuing joblessness and poverty. </p> <p>There are terrible examples of corporate capitalist recklessness in developing countries; the chemical leak in the Union Carbide plant in Bhopal, India, in 1984, is an often-cited instance. But capitalists are not always wrong, as was shown in 1995 when Shell and the British government, under pressure from Greenpeace activists, gave up a perfectly sensible plan to dump the Brent Spar oil platform at sea in favour of a more expensive and less environmentally friendly disposal on shore. Nor does the record of central planning suggest that it offers benefits to living conditions or the environment. A visit to central Asia - to the shrinking and polluted Aral Sea, for example - provides evidence of that. It is true that growth affects the environment; that is not a problem to lay at the door of globalisation, unless we embrace the full eco-totalitarian position that everyone - everyone else, that is - has an inalienable right to live in a primitive state of nature. A World Bank study in 2003 showed that with very few exceptions companies did not choose to invest in poorer countries in order to avoid the costs of pollution abatement in richer ones. </p> <p>So what about the charge that globalisation kills off the state? Does economic globalisation mean the end of sovereignty and the creation of new kinds of governance, perhaps by global corporations, with what the essayist John Ralston Saul describes as their own royal court, their own fool, at Davos, the annual World Economic Forum? When discussing globalisation, the greatest danger time and again is in letting the word itself run far ahead of the thing it is supposed to describe. We know that a central feature is greater trade between more open economies brought closer together by technology. But global corporations such as Exxon Mobil, General Motors and Wal-Mart are still operating within structures that influence and constrain what they do. They have to be aware, for a start, of a network of other firms and businesses, producers and customers. </p> <p>The principal regulator of any production line or enterprise remains the nation-state, though there are other supranational institutions, such as the IMF , the WTO, or regional groupings such as the EU or Nafta, that also contribute to regulating companies. States have set up an expanding number of suprastate organisations with their own growing jurisdiction. Shipping laws are written by the International Maritime Organisation; air-safety laws by the International Civil Aviation Organisation; many food standards are set by the Food and Agriculture Organisation. There are expanding networks of influence and control from banking and accountancy to health and water. Many corporations inevitably try to shop around for lighter regulation; many states seek to provide it. The fact remains that all big corporations continue to operate within national and international regulatory frameworks, even if some are ingenious in manipulating them to reduce their tax burden. From an economic standpoint, globalisation is defined not by the obsolescence of the state, nor by the rise of new \"megacorporations\" with greater value than the GDPs of many states. What really defines what has been happening are the new interactions between corporations and national and international regulatory regimes. </p> <p>It is an awful thing when states die, as the world saw in China in the 1920s and 30s and the former Soviet Union in the 1990s. But whatever the scaremongers might tell you, it is not what we are witnessing today.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Extracted from What Next?: Surviving the Twenty-first Century by Chris Patten, to be published by Allen Lane on October 2, price \u00a325.

  "<p>Banks in Europe and the US will suffer a second wave of massive losses from the credit crunch over the next few months that could leave some fighting for survival with little access to additional funds, according to a report by credit rating agency Standard and Poor's.</p> <p>After six months spent shoring up their finances, banks will be forced to write off billions of pounds in extra losses after a further deterioration in the economic outlook for western economies and, more particularly, a further slump in the US housing market, which was the spark for the first credit crunch last summer.</p> <p>Homes in some US states have fallen in value by as much as 50%, with a knock-on effect around the world. UK house prices have fallen 10% to 12% with predictions of further falls over the coming year.</p> <p>The Standard and Poor's report said its estimate earlier this year of total credit crunch losses of more than $250bn had now risen to $378bn - and could double to nearer $500bn as house prices in the US continue to fall.</p> <p>The demise of Lehman Brothers at the weekend has made the situation worse because it was a major player in the buying and selling of toxic mortgages that, in some instances, have lost more than 80% of their value. Lehman also owned $33bn of property. A fire sale of its assets could further depress the property market. </p> <p>While the sovereign wealth funds of countries such as Kuwait and China have come to the rescue of banks such as Barclays and Citigroup with large injections of cash, the report points out that they are reluctant to invest further until the turmoil in western stock markets has calmed. South Korea's sovereign wealth fund pulled out of a last-ditch rescue deal of Lehman's last week, triggering its collapse. </p> <p>Without access to further cash to replace losses on prime real estate in the US, and mounting losses from house price falls in the UK, banks could face a double squeeze on their finances.</p> <p>The report said: \"The finance industry raised a huge amount of capital over the past year to compensate for losses. Present market conditions are less favourable, and financial institutions face this next wave of write-downs with reduced opportunities to raise additional capital.\"</p> <p>For this reason, the report added: \"The second half of 2008 may prove to be the most difficult test yet for the battered global financial sector.\"</p>",
  "<p>Children who are given paracetamol in their early years are more likely to get asthma, researchers say today at the end of a major worldwide study.</p> <p>More than 200,000 children were involved in the research in 31 countries, making this the biggest and most authoritative study of the links between asthma and paracetamol ever carried out. The scientists found that babies given paracetamol, such as the ubiquitous Calpol, which is licensed for use over two months of age, were more likely to develop asthma. So were those in later childhood who were given it frequently. Use of the drug was also associated with a risk of eczema and rhinoconjunctivitis (allergy-linked runny nose and watering eyes).</p> <p>Professor Richard Beasley, from the Medical Research Institute of New Zealand in Wellington, and colleagues, who publish their results today in the Lancet medical journal, say the study shows taking paracetamol is a \"risk factor\" for childhood asthma. It does not prove it causes it, but may be a reason to avoid over-use.</p> <p>\"We stress the findings do not constitute a reason to stop using paracetamol in childhood,\" they say. \"Paracetamol remains the preferred drug to relieve pain and fever in children. However, the findings do lend support to the current guidelines of the World Health Organisation, which recommend that paracetamol should not be used routinely, but should be reserved for children with a high fever (38.5C or above).\"</p> <p>The spread in the use of paracetamol has coincided with a rise in asthma worldwide over the 50 years since the drug was launched on the market.</p> <p>The suspicion of a link to asthma has been around for a while and other studies have been done suggesting it could have an impact on babies in the womb, children and adults. The power of the new study, however, is in its scale and its global scope.</p> <p>A total of 205,487 children aged between six and seven were involved in the study. Their parents filled in detailed questionnaires including questions that asked about the use of paracetamol to treat fever in the first year of the child's life and the frequency of use in the last year. </p> <p>The researchers found that children aged six to seven who had been given paracetamol in the first year of life had a 46% increased risk of asthma. Those who had been given it in the last year were more likely to develop asthma the more doses they were given - medium use increased the risk by 61% and high use (once a month) more than three times. If they were given it in the first year of life, their chances of rhinoconjunctivitis rose by 48% and of eczema by 35%.</p> <p>Professor Jeffrey Aronson, president of the British Pharmacological Society, said the report \"underlines the importance of a current recommendation that paracetamol should not be used regularly in young children.\"</p>",
  "<p>It's faintly terrifying. It's the sound of a million tills ringing. And of a hundred light bulbs going on above the heads of harassed record company executives. </p> <p>The screaming that accompanies the London appearance of the Jonas Brothers, Disney's latest clean-cut teen pop idols, at the premiere of the TV movie that has helped propel them to stardom in the US, is at once the sound of pop's past and its future. From the Monkees on, television and films have played a role in bringing music to the teen masses. But the Disney franchise machine, spinning off albums, theatrical performances and concerts from the likes of High School Musical and Hannah Montana, takes it to another level entirely. </p> <p>Camp Rock, which airs on the Disney Channel in the UK tonight, is a vehicle for perhaps the company's biggest stars to date - Nick, Kevin and Joe Jonas. It also acts as the debut for another, Demi Lovato, whose first album will be co-produced and co-written by the Jonases. As hundreds of kids pour out of the premiere, wide-eyed and breathless, it is clear they have found their soundtrack to the autumn. And other broadcasters and record labels are looking on, eager to make their own version of the Disney model. </p> <p>Next month, ITV launches Britannia High. The \"Fame meets High School Musical\" weekly show will feature songs by Take That's Gary Barlow and a cast of fresh-faced wannabe stars. It will culminate in a 90-minute finale showcasing songs from the series and the \"journeys\" of the individual characters at a fictional performing arts school. </p> <p>A co-production between ITV and Globe Productions (the TV arm of Universal, the world's biggest record label), it borrows shamelessly from the Disney lexicon. Rich Ross, president of Disney Channels Worldwide, says: \"We have these touch points that underpin everything we do. One of them is 'express yourself', another is 'celebrate your family.'\" The blurb from Britannia High's advance publicity reads: \"They're learning to be the best they can, in every possible sense, learning as much about life, themselves and each other as they do about their art.\" </p> <p>As the music industry is looking beyond traditional revenue streams for new income, so mass-market broadcasters, which have always relied on advertising revenues, are looking to global sales and licensing deals for growth. ITV's hope lies in coming up with formats and ideas that, like Britannia High, can be sold around the world. It also hopes to use the show, the brainchild of Strictly Come Dancing judge Arlene Phillips and theatre producer David Ian, as a model for future co-productions with major record labels. </p> <p>\"We're very excited by it. It's one we hope will be an all-singing, all-dancing 360-degree proposition. What we want to do is offer it on as many platforms as possible around the main broadcast. We would hope to be successful with international exploitation of the format and programme sales. You're looking to create something that can be replicated anywhere else in the world,\" says Kate Little, director of business affairs at ITV Productions. Expect to see a raft of spinoff programmes, supplemented by content on the internet, mobile phones and ITV's digital channels. Add to that soundtrack albums, downloads and merchandise. It is no coincidence that ITV has recently hired a raft of senior US executives well versed in the art of creating global brands. </p> <p>\"The main ambition for Britannia High is that it rates well and gradually grows into an international property. It doesn't have to sell x-thousand albums or launch an artist straight away,\" says David Joseph, the chairman and chief executive of Universal's UK division. </p> <p>The link between the Disney behemoth and the ITV attempt to replicate its success is Universal, which distributes some artists signed to Disney subsidiary Hollywood Records, including the Jonas Brothers and Miley Cyrus, the star of Hannah Montana. But what Universal really wants is its own slice of the action. Among the major labels, casting around for new models to compensate for plummeting CD sales and the impact of digital piracy, there is a new enthusiasm for trying to combine television and the internet to create a direct route to the hearts of young fans. </p> <p>So how did Disney find this new way to sell music?</p> <p>\"David Agnew, who runs the Walt Disney record label in the States, says he is the envy and the scourge of his colleagues,\" says Gary Marsh, president of entertainment for Disney Channels Worldwide. \"The envy because he has the power of Disney Channel to help launch these acts, and the scourge because they don't. Television has become the new radio. Our audience, the six- to 12-year-old demographic, is acutely attuned to the music world. By and large, the record companies dismissed them as too poor, too uninterested, too parochial. We figured out a model that feels like music just for them, that somebody thought through and delivered to the place that is most natural for them to consume it.\" </p> <p>David Joseph says access to a platform - be it primetime ITV with Britannia High, or the social network Bebo with its interactive drama experiment The Secret World of Sam King - is now crucial in launching a pop act, because the old routes such as Saturday morning kids' TV and pop magazines like Smash Hits have died. </p> <p>\"The single biggest change in the pop market in the last five years is that you now look at the platform as much as the music or the artist,\" he says. \"It's more difficult, but if you get it right the rewards are greater. If you hit the bullseye it's exciting. With all of this stuff, Disney included, the songs have to be great. When you go to a Jonas Brothers concert, you still get the same sensation as when you saw Take That in 1992.\" </p> <p>The reason that rivals will find it so hard to replicate Disney's global success is demonstrated by its impressive - and slightly terrifying - efficiency. Months before Camp Rock hit town, Disney began bombarding journalists with figures about High School Musical's global dominance. To take just one, the High School Musical 2 soundtrack was the biggest-selling album in the world last year, shifting more than 6m copies. And the biggest seller the year before? The first High School Musical soundtrack. </p> <p>Then comes the hype about the US version of Camp Rock (24.5 million viewers over its opening weekend in the US; the song This Is Me rocketing to the top of the iTunes chart). And that's before seemingly the entire Disney board hits town, together with the cast, for the impeccably organised premiere. </p> <p>While the rest of the industry gave up on the under-14 market to target less challenging, less volatile areas, Disney seized its opportunity. \"Clearly, the paradigm has changed. What has really accelerated in the last three or four years is that the Disney Channel has become an incredible content creation machine for the rest of the Walt Disney company. It is a fundamental shift in how business is done and how television is perceived within the company,\" says Marsh. </p> <p>Mark Sutherland, global editor of trade magazine Billboard, says Disney is practising what every other major label preaches when it comes to the much-discussed, but rarely realised, \"360 degree\" model. \"They have been clever in the way they've gone about this. They're not just selling records, they're signing talent and applying it across multiple platforms,\" he says. </p> <p>The other thing Disney has on its side is a keen appreciation of the need for a bottom-up, viral buzz in the digital age. The Jonas Brothers' most recent video has been viewed almost 30m times on YouTube. \"The successes we've had would still have been successful, and the failures would still have failed, without the global digital model,\" says Marsh. \"What it's done is accelerate the process geometrically. You've supercharged the curve. That's what the internet has done.\" </p> <p>Combine that viral buzz with saturation television coverage - Disney will typically air each movie dozens of times across its various kids' channels - and the audience will develop a far deeper relationship with the artists than a record company marketing budget can create. </p> <p>\"Our relationship between the performers and the audience is fundamentally different because of the way they experience this talent,\" says Marsh. \"You see these kids in a storytelling context, so you know who they are. Your relationship to them is as a friend. It's as though you're buying your best friend's record. That's why it's working.\" </p> <p>There is another useful side effect to targeting under-12s, Marsh says. \"Our audience is either too young or too well supervised to steal. They're buying the music, they're actually buying it. This is a dream come true for a label.\" </p> <p>However, new star Demi Lovato, in town with the Jonas Brothers as part of the aforementioned media blitz, has forgotten to read the script. \"I probably shouldn't say this for business reasons,\" she says. \"But if someone stole my music, I'd be honoured that someone was listening to my song. I love making music so that people can listen to it rather than to make money out of it.\" </p> <p>Kevin Jonas, the eldest brother, jumps in to save his Camp Rock co-star. \"And then buy a T-shirt! That's why the internet has played such a huge part in both our careers - that's why the demand for the new album here was so quick. They had already heard the last one and they wanted more.\"</p> <p>For those tiring of the Disney production line, there is little respite. High School Musical 3 is on its way, as a theatrical release rather than a TV movie, and Lovato and the Jonas Brothers have new TV series to look forward to. Inevitably, Camp Rock 2 is already in production. </p> <p>The last word goes to Rich Ross of Disney: \"In the old days, the line used to be 'the hits that keep on coming'. We're making that a reality again.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Camp Rock premieres on the Disney Channel tonight at 6pm</p>",
  "<p>John McCain is to take his running mate Sarah Palin to the UN general assembly in New York next week for the annual gathering of foreign leaders, to address her chronic shortage of foreign policy experience.</p> <p>McCain is scheduled to open an international conference in the city at the same time - Bill Clinton's Global Initiative foundation, which provides funds to help fight Aids in developing countries.</p> <p>Palin's fast-learning trip to New York comes as a veteran Republican senator, Chuck Hagel, who is on the Senate foreign affairs committee, yesterday questioned her fitness for office. \"She doesn't have any foreign policy credentials,\" Hagel told the Omaha World-Herald. \"You get a passport for the first time in your life last year?

  "<p>This Sunday is World Alzheimer's Day, an annual event, and it's happening this year at rather an encouraging time. It is encouraging not because of any great breakthrough in the diagnosis or treatment of this terrible disease, but because sufferers and their relatives are increasingly willing to talk about it.</p> <p>Carol Thatcher was harshly rebuked in the Daily Mail last month for revealing in a book that her mother, Margaret, had been suffering from dementia for at least eight years: columnist Amanda Platell, a former press secretary of William Hague, accused her of \"betrayal\" and of not \"contributing anything other than prurience to her mother's personal and political legacy\". But Platell's comments suggest that she, like many others, still regards dementia as something to be ashamed of, whereas those directly affected by the condition are desperately keen that no stigma should be attached to it.</p> <p>One such is Diana Melly, widow of the writer and jazz singer George Melly, who had a very tough time looking after him when he had the disease. \"If more people talked openly about dementia, the people who care for [its victims] wouldn't get so lonely,\" she has said. \"I think keeping it a secret adds to the loneliness.\"</p> <p>This was a consideration that prompted Ronald Reagan in 1994 to reveal that he was afflicted by Alzheimer's. In a touching letter to his \"fellow Americans\", he said he knew that he was going to become a heavy burden on his wife Nancy. \"I only wish there was some way I could spare Nancy from this painful experience,\" he wrote. \"When the time comes, I am confident that with your help she will face it with faith and courage.\"</p> <p>Before he died last year, Melly followed Reagan's example by coming clean about his dementia. He was rather skittish about it, claiming even to enjoy it because, he said, he was a surrealist and dementia was a surreal experience. He nevertheless took Diana's trials seriously enough to give his last concert, three weeks before his death, in support of the charity For Dementia which runs a nursing service, called Admiral Nurses, for its victims and their carers. Diana turned to them for help as she struggled to take care of George, which involved stopping him going out on his own, endlessly searching for his things, reminding him to eat and drink, and coping with his uncharacteristic fits of aggression. They were, she says, a \"godsend\", and now she is a patron and fundraiser for the charity.</p> <p>Author Terry Pratchett not only informed the world that he had a rare form of Alzheimer's but also described his experiences of it on several radio and television programmes. Like Reagan, he disclosed his condition at an early enough stage to be able to talk lucidly and with good humour about it. Pratchett said he was \"taking it fairly philosophically\" and \"possibly with a mild optimism\", and that he was \"scrabbling to stay ahead long enough to be there when the cure comes along\". This is a spirit that gives encouragement to the afflicted and comfort to the carers, while also stimulating public interest and support. </p> <p>It would have been good if Margaret Thatcher, as a patron of the Alzheimer's Research Trust, had been able to do as her friend Reagan had done and not left it to her daughter to spill the beans. But then she has never been one to admit to any kind of frailty. As it is, we owe it to Carol that the public now understands that dementia can strike even the clearest and most ordered of brains. </p> <p>Margaret Thatcher's case was invoked this week by a fellow patron of the Alzheimer's Research Trust, who appealed in a letter to the Times for the state to end the \"national disgrace\" of its measly expenditure on dementia research (3% of its medical research budget on a disease that already costs the British economy \u00a317bn a year).</p> <p>Pauline Perry, another Conservative member of the Lords and a former Chief Inspector of Schools in England, wrote that she had recently sat at lunch with the former prime minister and found it \"sad to see how she struggles with everyday conversation\". As Perry said, dementia \"can attack anyone, no matter how famous or clever\".</p> <p><strong>The event most likely to relieve the gloom of the financial </strong>crisis is the coming vice-presidential debate between Joe Biden and Sarah Palin. It will be hugely entertaining to see how the seasoned old senator copes with the ferociously ambitious and wildly popular \"hockey mom\" who makes a virtue out of her lack of Washington experience.</p> <p>\"I will take issue with her ideas as strongly as I possibly can,\" Biden has said. \"I will be unrelenting in my debate,\" he promised. \"But I will not do what she is able to do so well ... I am not good at the one-line zingers.\" Happily, \"one-line zingers\" may have had their day. When people are deeply worried about their jobs and prospects, they are likely to be less tickled by jokes about pitbulls and lipstick. It's reassurance and authority they will be looking for, and this, one hopes, will give Biden the advantage. </p> <p>If anything good is to come out of the banking meltdown, it will be the fall from grace of Palin, whose record reveals her as lacking in both substance and consistency - a \"fiscal conservative\" who as mayor of the little town of Wasilla raised taxes and expenditure by more than a third; a campaigner against cronyism who, both as mayor and governor of Alaska, ruthlessly fired experienced staff and replaced them with her own cronies.</p> <p>But, to be fair, she is consistent about some things - killing polar bears, for example, drilling for oil in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge, and allowing mines to pollute salmon streams. On Wednesday she won the Rubber Dodo award, given to her by the The Centre for Biological Diversity, for crimes against the environment.</p> <p><strong>This week Alexander's ignorance of </strong>\"credit default swaps\" and \"triparty repo\" undermined his efforts to understand the world banking crisis, but <strong>he enjoyed the Last Night of the Proms on TV</strong>: \"A blatant attempt to promote the Union with contributions from every corner of the British Isles.

  "<p>Retail sales showed a surprising jump of 1.2% in August, official figures showed yesterday. The City had expected a fall of 0.5% but the Office for National Statistics said the growth was driven by summer promotions and back-to-school shopping. </p> <p>Textile, clothing and footwear sales rose 4.1% in the month to stand 8.8% higher than a year earlier. Statisticians pointed to a surge in sales of childrens' shoes ahead of the new term. </p> <p>Sales on the high street and internet increased by 3.3% in the year to August.</p> <p>Economists said the figures were surprisingly strong and at odds with recent figures from the British Retail Consortium and Confederation of British Industry. They also contradicted figures from the housing market, where the Council of Mortgage Lenders said yesterday that mortgage lending in August hit its lowest in three years.</p> <p>Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at Global Insight, said: \"Frankly these retail sales data are hard to believe and probably need to be taken with a huge pinch of salt. The data seem very much at odds with the survey evidence coming from both the British Retail Consortium and the CBI, as well as the news coming from most retailers.</p> <p>\"Regardless of what the hard data show, the prospects for consumer spending over the coming months look bleak. Consumers are being hit left, right and centre. Furthermore, the current heightened financial sector turmoil is likely to further depress spending.\"</p> <p>He believed that the jump diluted the case for an interest rate cut in the near-term, particularly given current inflation, but stated that the Bank of England had expressed reservations on the accuracy of the retail sales data.</p> <p>The British Retail Consortium releases its own monthly survey of high street sales, and reported that sales fell 1% last month compared with August last year.</p> <p>Stephen Robertson, director general of the consortium, said: \"These unexpectedly resilient [ONS] figures fail to convey how tough conditions are for customers and retailers. Plenty of retailers would be delighted if their sales values were up nearly 4% on a year ago. </p> <p>\"Fundamental conditions are weakening, not improving, and recent banking industry uncertainty can only make customers more nervous about spending.</p> <p>\"Yes, clothing and footwear sales growth has risen but that growth is modest and driven by discounts. It cannot be called strong and cannot explain the ONS's high overall figures. We respect the ONS's process but the Bank of England is right to treat these figures as only one measure of retail performance.\"</p> <p>Several big retailers have been struggling. Department store chain Debenhams posted a 0.9% fall this week in sales for the year to August 30, although it said the performance was credible given the tough environment. Woolworths slumped to a \u00a399.7m loss in the six months to August. It reported this week that like-for-like sales were down more than 3% in August despite a boom in computer games . </p> <p>Gross mortgage lending fell by 12% to \u00a321.8bn in August from \u00a324.7bn in July - its lowest since April 2005. Gross mortgage lending was 36% down in August from the same month last year.</p> <p> Michael Coogan, director general at the Council of Mortgage Lenders, said: \"These figures reflect the heightened uncertainty for both lenders and consumers in the mortgage market. </p> <p>\"Lenders are uncertain about future sources of funding and the cost of funding, while consumers are unsure about how much further and for how long house prices will continue to decline.\"</p> <p>The council blamed the slump on the \"exceptionally low\" housing market turnover, which has seen transactions drop by 50% compared with last year. It said re-mortgaging activity had also been lower than anticipated, adding that monthly lending figures looked set to remain subdued in the immediate future.</p>",

  "<p>Mrs A lives in Dovercourt Road in north Bristol and considers five people on her street as friends. But Mrs B, who is roughly the same age and lives round the corner in a very similar house in Muller Street, has only one friend. </p> <p>The difference, says a study, has nothing to do with personality, but is because of the weight of traffic. Fewer than 150 vehicles a day pass down Dovercourt Road, compared with more than 21,130 a day on Muller Street. </p> <p>New research, based on interviews with households on three Bristol streets, has found that people who live with high levels of motor traffic are far more likely to be socially disconnected and even ill than people who live in quiet, clean streets. </p> <p>It confirms a study done by a British academic in San Francisco in 1969. This found the weight of traffic in urban areas largely determined people's quality of life and also identified a major erosion of community on busy streets. The Bristol study is the first time that research has been conducted in Britain.</p> <p>Joshua Hart, a researcher at the University of the West of England, Bristol, looked at Muller Street, Filton Avenue and Dovercourt Road, three streets with very different traffic flows. </p> <p>He dubbed them Heavy (Muller Street), Medium (Filton Avenue), and Light (Dovercourt Road) streets and mapped the movement of residents. People were asked to identify their social contacts, and say what they considered to be their \"home\". </p> <p>He found wide differences in community interaction and a serious deterioration of community life on busy roads. On average, residents on Heavy Street had about one fifth the number of local friends and only half the number of acquaintances compared with the people living in Light Street. </p> <p>People there admitted to knowing very few others in the road, had very few friends on the other side of the street and seldom crossed over. \"It's hellishly busy. The buses and lorries shake the house and the air pollution can be quite bad,\" said one man. Residents on Light Street, however, reported that they felt a sense of community, frequently popped in and out of each others' homes and said that they felt personally responsible for a much larger area than residents on Heavy Street. </p> <p>More than half the people interviewed said they felt \"at home\" in other people's houses. \"People stay for a while and put down roots,\" said one man. \"We look after each other,\" said another.</p> <p>Hart also found people were taking extreme measures to adapt to the noisy, dirty environment on Heavy Street. Residents largely lived in the back rooms of their houses and many chose dark or black curtains to conceal the soot build-up from vehicles. </p> <p>They kept their front windows closed, did not allow children to play in the street and usually accompanied them to school, he said.</p> <p>Heavy Street also found people less likely to care for their street. \"The whole street needs knocking down and rebuilding\" was one comment. \"People argue and shout regularly.\" </p> <p>It could not have been more different on Light Street, reported Hart. There, very few people felt the need to build a fence or a wall in the front garden, and most people had their windows open. </p> <p>Residents there reported almost three times the number of gathering spots compared with Heavy Street. </p> <p>\"The primary influence on social deterioration is the external effect of traffic, not any possible personality differences among residents of the three streets,\" he concluded. </p> <p>\"Growing car dependence is creating an epidemic of deteriorated mental and physical health associated with air and noise pollution, inactivity and road deaths and injuries. </p> <p>\"It seems that community and quality of life have been neglected whilst planning and transport policies have led to a massive growth in motor vehicles in the UK,\" said Hart. </p> <p>\"More than 5 million extra cars are expected on the UK's roads by 2031, and these findings point to an urgent need for the government to provide healthy residential environments and to stem traffic growth by investing in public transport, walking and cycling in order to avoid many more local communities being impacted.\"</p>",
  "<p>At least seven African countries or regions have reduced malaria deaths by half following a drive to protect people through the use of bed nets, treat those who fall sick and eliminate mosquitoes, the World Health Organisation said yesterday.</p> <p>The success stories include Eritrea, Rwanda and the island nation of Sao Tome and Principe, which are not only managing to prevent and treat malaria but also have good data on cases and deaths. In a report on the global burden of the disease, published yesterday, the WHO says more countries may be reducing death rates, but do not yet have the statistics to prove it.</p> <p>\"With dramatic increases in funding and intense momentum towards reducing the malaria burden in recent years we have a greater need for reliable information and analysis,\" said WHO director general Margaret Chan. \"Progress in malaria control has accelerated dramatically since 2006, especially in the wake of the UN secretary general's call for universal malaria control coverage by the end of 2010.\"</p> <p>But the report, which covers the years 2004 to 2006, estimates that there were 247m cases in 2006 and an estimated 881,000 deaths. Nearly all who died (91%) were in Africa and 85% were under five.</p> <p>There is now general agreement on measures to fight malaria but, particularly in the worst-hit areas of Africa, drugs, bed nets and sprays are slow to get to where they are needed and far short of the 80% target for coverage set by the WHO.</p> <p>Surveys in 18 African countries show that 34% of households own an insecticide-treated bed net, but even in those homes that have them they are not always used to protect the most vulnerable - only 23% of children and 27% of pregnant women slept under a net.</p>",
  "<p>He calls himself Robin Bank and acts as the self-appointed avenger of downtrodden loan defaulters and all poor victims of the global financial meltdown. </p> <p>Like his hero Robin Hood, Spanish outlaw Enric Duran steals from the rich and gives, if not to the poor, at least to the activist groups who are sworn enemies of the banking system. </p> <p>Yesterday Duran circulated 200,000 copies of a single-issue free newspaper called Crisis to show how he had spent the past two years fooling banks into lending him nearly half a million euros (about \u00a3395,000).</p> <p>He said he had given it all away to social activists or spent it on the newspaper. He is refusing to pay the money back and daring the banks to get him sent to jail.</p> <p>\"If we include interest on arrears the present amount of debt is over \u20ac500,000, which I will not pay,\" he said.</p> <p>As Duran, 32, went into hiding, copies of the newspaper were being handed out by friends and relatives to commuters at dozens of metro and railway stations in his home city of Barcelona.</p> <p>Friends said he had fled the country earlier this week.</p> <p>News of his exploits caught Spain's high street banks, consumer finance houses and building societies by surprise. They were busy yesterday checking their loan portfolios to see whether Duran was on the list.</p> <p>He has provided a list of all the 39 banks he took loans from. They include one bank, Cetelem, that gave him five loans.</p> <p>The police and the local attorney general's office said they had not yet started looking for Duran as they were waiting for one of the banks to lodge a formal request for him to be found. </p> <p>Duran said he had raised the loans partly by setting up a false television production company. He paid back some of the early loans to ensure he had a good credit rating but stopped paying them all earlier this year. </p> <p>He had started out by getting personal loans but eventually used a company name to avoid being placed on a list of bad debtors.</p> <p>A small businesses office of the regional Catalan government unwittingly helped him raise at least one of the loans, according to reports yesterday.</p> <p>Most of the money had been donated to social activism groups. </p> <p>\"What could be better than robbing the ones who rob us and distributing the money among the groups which are denouncing this situation and building alternatives?\" he asked.</p> <p>Bankers reacted angrily. \"It is not permissible for someone to laugh [at the system] like this,\" Jordi Mestre, director general of the Caixa Sabadell savings bank, told the Europa Press news agency.</p> <p>Other banks said they would have no trouble writing off the lost money. </p> <p>\"Even if it is confirmed that he took \u20ac31,000, it won't mean anything to us,\" said a spokesman for Bankinter.</p> <p>Duran posted a video interview of himself on the internet yesterday. </p> <p>\"It has been an individual disobedience action against banking that I have carried out to denounce the banking system,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Banks need to grant loans because that is the main way for them to get profits. It is a wheel that will not stop until the system comes to a standstill. As individuals, instead of helping the wheel to roll by asking for loans we have the opportunity and responsibility of making things difficult for this system.\"</p> <p>The social activist could face a prison term of up to six years if convicted. </p> <p>\"When I started this action I was already prepared for that possibility,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>In April this year the G7 finance ministers, worried about growing financial turbulence, endorsed the approach to regulation presented to them in a report from an eminent group including the chairman of Britain's Financial Services Authority, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The report began with an honest recognition of past failure: \"A striking aspect of the turmoil has been the extent of risk management weaknesses and failings at regulated and sophisticated firms.\"</p> <p>There followed a series of detailed recommendations, the essence of which was embodied in three core themes: greater transparency, greater disclosure, and stricter risk management by firms. In other words, nothing new. The committee was repeating the tired trinity that has defined financial regulation for the past three decades. The trinity failed - and without a new approach the regulators will fail again.</p> <p>That failure had two closely related origins. Regulation failed to keep up with the institutional changes that in 30 years have transformed financial markets; and the regulators accepted that firms had the technical skills, expressed in mathematical risk models, to manage risk better than the regulator could.</p> <p>Thirty years ago most loans, to businesses and to individuals, were made by banks, or specialist institutions such as building societies. The deregulatory fervour of the 1980s changed that. Credit markets became \"disintermediated\" - instead of banks acting as intermediaries between savers and borrowers, the markets took over. Borrowing is now packaged into securities that are sliced and sold through a myriad of financial intermediaries. Investment banks, such as Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs, are (or were) at the centre of this process, taking on massive amounts of debt relative to their capital base (that is, becoming highly leveraged) in order to deal profitably in the complex web of markets. Guiding their operations are their risk models, which measure the riskiness of their operations against patterns of past market behaviour. The firms claimed they could manage risky markets, and the regulators swallowed that claim. Faith in transparency, disclosure, and risk management by firms is at the heart of the financial regulation today.</p> <p>Yet at the same time it is generally accepted that a core purpose of financial regulation is to mitigate systemic risks, like a global credit crunch. Such risks are externalities; their cost to the economy as a whole is greater than the cost to a firm whose actions are creating the risk. But if regulators focus on risks that are recognised by firms already, and neglect systemic risk, why do we need regulation at all, other than to enforce best practice? Firms will manage risks well enough, using systems that are inevitably, and properly, market sensitive.</p> <p>The flaw is that in the face of systemic market failures the market is inefficient. Risk is mispriced, with consequences that are all too evident today.</p> <p>So what can be done to tackle \"systemic\" risks? First, regulators must begin to base their approach on the system as a whole. For example, while financial firms are encouraged by supervisors to conduct thousands of stress tests on their risk models, few are conducted by the regulator on a system-wide scale. If it is possible to have system-wide stress tests on the impact of Y2K, or of avian flu, why not on liquidity? The regulator should conduct tests to determine which scenarios - such as a 40% drop in house prices - are mostly likely to produce systemic stress. The information gleaned should feed into regulatory measures that might be quite different from those suggested by the risk management of an individual firm. </p> <p>Second, financial institutions must be required to undertake pro-cyclical provisioning, raising their reserves in good times and using those reserves as a cushion in bad times, as has been proposed by Charles Goodhart and Avinash Persaud. Rules determining these reserves would be quite different from those governing the regulatory capital financial institutions are required to hold today. That capital is a charge, not a buffer. The provisioning requirements should be based on the health of the economy as a whole, so capturing systemic strength and weakness. A policy like this has been pursued in Spain, where, despite the real-estate crisis, banks have remained strong. Astonishingly, the Spanish system is being dismantled because it is not in accord with international financial accounting standards.</p> <p>Third, regulation must escape from its present focus on the nature of institutions - commercial banks are regulated differently from investment banks, while hedge funds are not regulated at all - and concentrate instead on function. Willem Buiter's proposal that regulation be targeted on highly leveraged institutions, whatever their formal legal status, is an important step in this direction. Many years ago the only significant highly leveraged institutions were commercial banks. Today, leverage is a characteristic of firms throughout the financial system. There is no such thing as safe leverage. It is this leverage that threatens gridlock in a disintermediated system. Regulation must switch to a functionally defined approach as a vital component of systemic regulation. The potential spread of pollution is what matters, not the legal entity of the polluter.</p> <p>Domestic and international regulators must abandon the tired trinity and focus now on the systemic risks generated by today's financial markets. The next time you hear a regulator arguing that greater transparency is the answer, you will know that he or she doesn't understand the question.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Lord Eatwell is president of Queens' College, Cambridge, and director of the Centre for Financial Analysis and Policy at the Judge Business School </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:j.eatwell@cerf.cam.ac.uk\">j.eatwell@cerf.cam.ac.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>The return of the Champions League this week has seen Uefa conduct a behind-the-scenes crackdown on racism. In a letter circulated to match delegates and refereeing officials, Uefa's president, Michel Platini, set out a zero-tolerance policy for offenders.</p> <p>\"It is vital that your post-match reports ... demonstrate no leniency whatsoever in the face of violent, racist or discriminatory behaviour on the part of players, club officials, technical staff or fans,\" wrote Platini. \"You are the instruments and implementers of this policy and I urge you to be as firm as possible. The image of football lies, to a great extent, in your hands.\"</p> <p>Match delegates have been instructed to demand that stewards scan stadiums in search of offensive banners and conduct. In order that they know what to look for, the letter was accompanied by a handbook depicting the slogans and symbols used by extremist groups. </p> <p>Platini has made the war on racism one of the principal elements of his presidency and has given his organisation's disciplinary department new teeth. </p> <p>Clubs and national teams must adhere to a revised set of disciplinary regulations, which came into force on July 1. Under Article 11bis, which deals with discrimination, the minimum fine is almost \u00a316,000. Although a paltry sum by modern football standards, it is the additional sanction that gives potential offenders pause for thought.</p> <p>These dictate that guilty associations or clubs must play matches behind closed doors or suffer a stadium closure.

The turnaround provided some respite for Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, the last two remaining investment banks on Wall Street.</p> <p>Short-selling has inspired government action because ministers are relying on Lloyds TSB's purchase of HBOS to revive the housing market and has agreed to override competition laws in return for a pledge by the newly created megabank to offer more home loans to first-time buyers. The chancellor, Alistair Darling, told the Guardian last night that the events of the past 13 months - culminating in the collapse this week of Lehman Brothers, and the takeover of Merrill Lynch and HBOS - had made the case for improved regulation unanswerable.</p> <p>Short-selling is where a trader borrows stock and sells it on in the hope of buying it back at a lower price before returning it to the original owner, often large institutional shareholders which charge a fee for the rent of the shares. While Darling is reluctant to ban the practice outright, he is concerned about its impact on the banking sector, where confidence is crucial.</p> <p>Hector Sants, chief executive of the FSA, said: \"While we regard short-selling as a legitimate investment technique in normal market conditions, the current extreme circumstances have given rise to disorderly markets. As a result, we have taken this decisive action, after careful consideration, to protect the fundamental integrity and quality of markets.\"</p> <p>Earlier, Brown had sought to take advantage of the government's part in arranging the merger to show that he was committed to reform of the City and tackling the financial crisis. Keen to re-establish his authority ahead of Labour's annual conference, Brown said: \"We are cleaning up the financial system where there have been problems and we are going to continue taking whatever action is necessary so we have a stable financial system.\"</p> <p>Darling said it was right to waive competition rules to allow the Lloyds TSB merger with HBOS, he said. \"If this hadn't gone through, competition would have been an academic problem. HBOS wasn't going to make it through the week.\"</p> <p>Last night, the FTSE 100 index fell for the fourth day, despite a $180bn injection to help banks with their cash flow. Lloyds TSB lost 15% as the FTSE closed 32.4 points lower at 4880.0 - a 10% fall this week. Wall Street also sank in early trading but staged a vigorous comeback late in the day, pushed higher by reports that the US government is considering creating a public body to accept banks' bad debts - a move similar to the creation of the Resolution Trust Corporation which tidied up a banking crisis in the early 1990s.</p> <p>Sir Victor Blank, chairman of Lloyds TSB, yesterday revealed details of the bargain struck with the prime minister to save HBOS. \"The transaction could only happen if the government would give its support,\" he said. \"On Monday evening, the prime minister said to me the government would give that support.\" He was referring to the need for ministers to suspend normal competition policy to allow the deal to take place more rapidly.</p> <p>When asked how the bank would counter abuse of its market dominance, particularly in mortgages, he said \"new lending\" by the combined bank for households and small businesses would \"continue at least at current levels\" and the bank would increase the range of products aimed at first-time buyers.</p> <p>Amid concern that up to 40,000 of the merged banks' 140,000 jobs could be axed, trade unions said they would not allow any compulsory redundancies. \"Staff in financial services should not have to pay the price for the greed and excess of the short-sellers and speculators,\" said Unite's deputy secretary, Graham Goddard.</p> <p>City investors supported the FSA move. Guy de Blonay, hedge fund manager at New Star, said: \"To bring a sick company to its knees is one thing, but to destroy healthy companies for a quick buck is another.\"</p>",
  "<p>Labour could still win the next election, but not by <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7617984.stm\">dumping</a> Gordon Brown and replacing him with <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4426131.ece \">David Miliband</a> or <a href=\"http://www.alanjohnson.org/\">Alan Johnson</a>. Changing the captain is pointless if the ship is on the wrong course, and if all the would-be captains are committed to carrying on regardless. </p> <p>Although the prime minister is uninspiring and lacks charisma, he is being unfairly scapegoated for the collective failures of the entire cabinet. They have all backed the disastrous policies that have got Labour in its current <a href=\"http://ukpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5hRyhxlrT6-YJFBTQAZgb4vCERqWg\">mess</a>. None have an agenda for serious change. </p> <p>That's why <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6943f116-82bc-11dd-a019-000077b07658.html\">ditching</a> the leader won't help. It would result in more of the same, but probably with a younger, more smiley face in charge of the doomed New Labour project. </p> <p>What's alienating voters is not Brown per se. It is the government's dire anti-Labour policies, such as post office closures, the 10p tax-rate fiasco, the unfairness of the council tax system and the lack of a coherent plan to remedy fuel poverty. </p> <p>Astonishingly, more than a year after the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7007076.stm\">Northern Rock crisis</a>, the government has not legislated any reform of the banking system and has failed to fully protect people's savings. This inertia has undermined public confidence in the government's financial acumen. </p> <p>None of Brown's likely successors would make any difference to Labour's fortunes, since they, like him, have been arch proponents of the government's anti-Labour agenda \u2013 including the war in Iraq, privatisation of public services, curtailment of civil liberties and the neglect of any proper regulation of banks and other financial institutions, which has contributed to the current economic turmoil. </p> <p>Despite Labour's current meltdown, there is still a possibility that it could recover enough to win a majority of seats in 2010. But only if it takes radical action to change its lack lustre, anti-progressive policies. </p> <p>A Labour revival in the polls would be significantly more likely if the government publicly acknowledged its mistakes and apologised. Although this would be an unusual and dramatic thing for a government to do \u2013 and a bit of a political gamble \u2013 I suspect that most voters would appreciate a bit of humility from our leaders. Saying sorry could go down well, if it was sincerely meant. </p> <p>This apology would, of course, need to be reinforced by the jettisoning of unpopular anti-Labour policies. Such policy reversals would show that the government is listening to the people. It would offer proof of Labour's contrition, and win general public approval. Then, over the subsequent months, the government could undertake a major relaunch with a series of headline-grabbing new policy announcements.</p> <p>Brown has currently earmarked over \u00a3100bn for an upgraded Trident nuclear missile system, two new super aircraft carriers, ID cards, the ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan and an expanded road-building programme. The government clearly has vast sums of money at its disposal but it is putting it into the wrong schemes. </p> <p>It would be hugely popular if the government dumped these right-wing policies, as the <a href=\"http://www.greenparty.org.uk/\">Green party</a> has urged, and switched this \u00a3100bn-plus expenditure into Labour-style policies. What might these be? </p> <p>Economic policy isn't everything, but the credit crunch is hitting most people hard. Here are some practical, popular ideas to help individuals and boost the economy:</p> <p>\u0095 Free home insulation for everyone with an income under \u00a315,000 a year, which would assist these householders to permanently cut their energy bills, and also create jobs and reduce global warming. </p> <p>\u0095 Stricter government regulation of energy and fuel prices, in order to curb excess profits. </p> <p>\u0095 Abolition of the \u00a3300 Home Information Packs and a two-year stamp duty holiday for first-time buyers of property worth less than \u00a3300,000, to help revive the housing market. </p> <p>\u0095 Cheaper, more reliable public transport, which would aid low-income car-less households, get more vehicles off the road, ease traffic congestion and cut carbon dioxide emissions. </p> <p>\u0095 Replacement of council tax with a local income tax, to end the hardship faced by low-income retirees who, because of increased house prices over the last decade, now live in high-value, high-tax properties. </p> <p>\u0095 Increase the deposit protection for savers to \u00a3100,000, to give security to seniors who have been wise enough to save for their retirement. </p> <p>\u0095 Raise tax-free personal allowances from \u00a36,035 to \u00a38,000 for people earning under \u00a320,000 a year and to \u00a37,000 for those earning \u00a320,000 to \u00a325,000, which would be funded by a rise in tax on incomes over \u00a380,000 and which would assist the lower-paid at a time of rocketing food prices. </p> <p>While this is not an exhaustive list of the many much-needed policy changes, these or similar policies would be popular and could, over several months, begin to win back public confidence and turn around Labour's dismal <a href=\"http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23557116-details/Battering+for+Brown+as+Cameron+polls+52/article.do\">poll ratings</a>.</p> <p>Even if this new (not New) Labour agenda did not deliver Labour a majority of seats in 2010, it might at least save the party from the electoral annihilation that now looks on the cards. It might put Labour in a position to form a minority government with Liberal Democrat, Plaid Cymru and SNP support. Not ideal. But surely preferable to a Labour wipe-out and a landslide victory for the Conservatives?</p>",

  "<p>Marine biologists have discovered hundreds of new and rare species while exploring the waters around two remote islands and a reef off the Australian coast.</p> <p>Scientists conducted in-depth surveys of marine life around the Heron and Lizard islands on the Great Barrier Reef off the country's northeastern coast, and in the waters around the 170-mile-long Ningaloo reef off the western coast.</p> <p>Among their findings were an estimated 130 new species of soft corals, several undescribed shrimp-like species - some with claws larger than their bodies - and dozens of tiny crustaceans. They also collected around 100 small organisms called isopods that are believed to be new to science. Some isopods are parasites and burrow into fishes' mouths and nibble their tongues away.</p> <p>Heron and Lizard islands are well-established diving sites for tourists, and despite both having well-established scientific research stations, conservationists know very little about the diversity of organisms that live in the surrounding waters. Ningaloo also draws divers, many of whom come to spot whale sharks that feed in the region.</p> <p>\"Our main goal is to understand what lives on coral reefs. They are the most biodiverse habitats in the oceans, but we still have a very poor idea of what lives on them,\" said Julian Caley, head of conservation and biodiversity at the Australian Institute of Marine Science and co-leader of the Census of Marine Life's reef project.</p> <p>\"This work will provide us with a baseline of what is out there. Reefs are under threat from a whole variety of impacts, from global warming to pollution and ocean acidification, and if we don't know what's out there now, we won't know whether or not our policies on managing reefs are succeeding in protecting them,\" he added.</p> <p>Divers surveyed waters up to 30m deep during the expeditions, using clear plastic traps to collect organisms. At some sites, divers put bags over dead corals and chiselled them free of the seabed to capture all of the organisms living inside. A single dead coral head can contain more than 150 individual crustaceans and molluscs. Teams from museums and herbaria accompanied the biologists to help identify any new species.</p> <p>\"We were all surprised and excited to find such a large variety of marine life never before described, most notably soft coral, isopods, tanaid crustaceans and worms, in waters that divers access easily and regularly,\" said Caley.</p> <p>Isopods are a richly diverse group of crustaceans, which use antennae to taste and smell food, while tanaid crustaceans are larger and often look similar to shrimps. Soft corals do not build reefs like hard corals do, but can still cover a quarter of the seabed at some sites, creating an important habitat for other species.</p> <p>The expeditions, which are part of a four-year effort to build up a detailed picture of marine life around the sites, will feed into a global census that will release its first report in 2010.</p>",

  "<p>\"I can't do the sums any way without having a slice of nuclear power in the mix. It doesn't work. I ask my enthusiastic green friends if they'll do the sums \u2013 and they can't\" said Professor Ian Fells on Radio 4's <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_7620000/7620289.stm\">Today programme</a> yesterday. As a stalwart member of the nuclear lobby it's unlikely Fells has many green friends. Last year we did the sums and found that through a radical rethink of how we use energy and massive investment in renewables, the UK could meet its energy needs without fossil fuels or nuclear. \"The sums\", as Professor Fells calls them are contained in our report, <a href=\"http://www.zerocarbonbritain.com\">Zero Carbon Britain</a>.</p> <p>Fells' comments coincide with the release of his report, <a href=\"http://fellsassociates.awardspace.com/site/PressRelease17thSept2008.html\">A Pragmatic Energy Policy for the UK</a>. The report claims that without a nuclear revival and investment in coal the UK will face an \"energy gap\" within the next decade. The report also states that renewables have a role to play, but the hope that they could provide large amounts of energy is \"wishful thinking\" and demonstrates a \"staggering lack of understanding of the technical and engineering reality of what can be built\". </p> <p>Zero Carbon Britain provides exactly the \"technical and engineering reality\" that Professor Fells claims is missing. </p> <p>The report models current UK energy demands across all sectors of the economy and assesses the potential for different renewable sources to replace fossil fuel and nuclear generation. This isn't wishful thinking; we've carefully modelled exactly where and when we use energy, and how we could replace current generation with renewables. The scenario uses a broad spread of different sources \u2013 onshore and offshore wind, solar, small-scale hydro and tidal power. It's true that the sun doesn't always shine and the wind doesn't always blow. But we've mapped the UK for renewable energy potential and found that by distributing the generation around the country, using storage and managing our energy use intelligently we can even out the ups and downs in supply and demand.</p> <p>Energy saving is crucial. The scenario requires us to reduce our<br>energy use by almost half. This won't mean a few energy saving lightbulbs and washing your clothes at 30C. It means big changes in our energy infrastructure \u2013 switching to electric cars and public transport, serious investment to insulate our existing buildings, and rethinking how we use energy to deliver our wellbeing.</p> <p>The combined threats of energy security and climate change mean that these changes need to happen quickly. The latest climate science suggests that we need to make reductions in greenhouse gases much faster than government targets \u2013 faster even than most campaigners and NGOs are calling for. If we want to avoid seriously destabilising the climate we've got roughly 20 years to reduce our emissions to zero. Zero Carbon Britain proves that this is technically possible. Because the timescale is so short this energy scenario only uses technology that is developed and ready to go. The urgency of the situation means we need to invest our limited resources in technologies we know are going to deliver within this 20 year timeframe. </p> <p>At the <a href=\"http://www.cat.org.uk/index.tmpl?refer=index&amp;init=1\">Centre for Alternative Technology</a> we produce all our electricity from our own renewable sources. I'd say we are pretty in touch with \"technical and engineering reality\". We know what works and what doesn't. We've been building, installing and living with these technologies for 35 years.

  "<p>A mixture of messages is being recieved from the two men now most publicly identified with the 2012 Games and their prospects for success. Seb Coe, the face of Games evangelism, has <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/olympics/article4765181.ece\">declared</a> himself not cowed by China's imperious announcement of its global power: \"Beijing has delivered a spectacular games and we will also deliver a spectacular games.\" By contrast, Boris Johnson has spoken of a \"more intimate\" Games - the \"language of estate agents,\" he calls this - and, in keeping with his unofficial role as financial good housekeeper, made a firm pledge about sticking to the budget. </p> <p>Can London 2012 be intimate and spectacular at the same time? I suppose it can, though given the deepening economic gloom it might prove necessary to draw on the long British history of ingenuity if the next Games are to leave a mark on Olympic history. In this respect, Boris and Seb could do worse than learn some lessons from the two previous London Olympics, in 1908 and 1948. Both were staged under difficult circumstances. The former were held at a hurriedly-built White City because Italy, the intended host, was forced to concentrate instead on rebuilding Naples following an eruption by Mount Vesuvius. The latter took place at Wembley in the harsh aftermath of the war. </p> <p>A feature of the London Olympiad a century ago was the inventiveness of the powers that be. After <a href=\"http://www.dorandopietri.it/biografia_en.asp\">Dorando Pietri</a> was deprived of victory in the marathon because officials helped him cross the finish line, Edward VII's consort Queen Alexandra gave him a special gold cup to make up for it. The marathon's length too was adjusted in light of circumstances: it was lengthened at one end so it would start at Windsor Castle and at the other so it would end in front of <a href=\"http://www.britannia.com/history/monarchs/mon59.html\">the king</a>. Here, surely, are precedents that could be called on should events in Stratford start to disappoint. Why not award our own prizes? Why not invent our own rules? Such interventions might not add to the spectacle, but they'd certainly be memorable. </p> <p>By 1948 there was less scope for such creative tampering, and not much cash to throw around either. We mustered a 35-foot flagpole, a Royal Artillery gun salute and 2,500 pigeons to release, but it wasn't much of a show compared with the Games preceding it. Still, those were Hitler's in 1936, and I know which of the two I feel fondest towards. Those ration book Games also contain a potential crumb of comfort if budgets really have got tight by 2012 - at least the pigeons in London are free.</p>",

  "<p>Yesterday's publication of the annual <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/18/islam.religion\">Pew survey</a> of global attitudes has found that both Islamophobia and antisemitism are on the rise in Europe.<br> Hostile attitudes towards Jews have increased in all European countries, except for one: Great Britain. The <a href=\"http://pewglobal.org/reports/pdf/262.pdf\">report (pdf)</a> said:</p> <blockquote> <p>Great Britain stands out as the only European country included in the survey where there has not been a substantial increase in antisemitic attitudes.</p> </blockquote> <p>As for attitudes towards Muslims, well:</p> <blockquote> <p>Opinions about Muslims in almost all of these countries are considerably more negative than are views of Jews.</p> </blockquote> <p>The report does not look into why this could be. Is it all to do with the threat of terrorist attacks? I am not so sure. That would not explain, for example, why there is increasing anti-Jewish sentiment in Europe \u2013 we are not facing terror attacks by Jewish extremists. <br> I have written several pieces for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jul/18/amaliciouscampaign\">Cif</a> where I have given examples of what I believe are regular and quite deliberate attempts on the part of some of our national newspapers to incite anti-Muslim prejudice.<br> Just last month, I wrote about how <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/31/religion.race\">Douglas Murray</a>, director of the Centre for Social Cohesion and a regular interviewee on BBC TV and radio had in a 2006 speech entitled \"What are we to do with Islam?\" demanded that:</p> <blockquote> <p>All immigration into Europe from Muslim countries must stop \u2026 Conditions for Muslims in Europe must be made harder across the board: Europe must look like a less attractive proposition.</p> </blockquote> <p>This campaign to vilify Muslims has not gone unnoticed by the British National party, whose leader, Nick Griffin, has openly argued that:<br> </p> <blockquote> <p>We should be positioning ourselves to take advantage for our own political ends of the growing wave of public hostility to Islam currently being whipped up by the mass media.</p> </blockquote> <p>On a slightly more hopeful note, the Pew report does the make the following two observations:</p> <blockquote> <p>Older people and those with less education are more antisemitic and anti-Muslim than are younger people or those with more education \u2026 Anti-Muslim and anti-Jewish opinions are most prevalent among Europeans on the political right.</p> </blockquote> <p>As a society it is noticeable we have all moved quite some way in recent years towards regarding prejudice and discrimination based on gender, race or sexual orientation as being unacceptable. The challenge now \u2013 for all of us, including British Muslims and Jews \u2013 must be to treat religious prejudice and discrimination as being equally abhorrent. </p> <p><em>Rabbi Jonathan Romain's blog on the Pew survey will be published on Cif tomorrow</em></p>",
  "<p>The crisis in the financial markets, which is now reaching a peak not seen since the 1930s, is not just the result of poor subprime mortgage lending and the collapse in the price of associated mortgage-backed derivatives. It is also the result of orchestrated short-selling by hedge funds and others seeking to make a fast buck by trying to drive down the share price of financial institutions with exposure to these areas. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/18/creditcrunch.wallstreet?commentpage=1\">Seth Freedman argues</a> that short-selling is not a problem and that it is simply the parallel to going long. This is not quite true. Selling a stock you own because you think the price is going to fall is one thing. Selling a stock you don't own in the hope or expectation that its price will fall is quite another. It also begs the question of where sellers get the stock to sell. Letting the markets work is all very well when its business as normal but when they threaten the stability of the system, new rules are needed. The idea that government should stand idly by while short-sellers target another victim to make a profit is simply not on in current circumstances</p> <p>Short-selling involves selling stock you do not own, in the hope or expectation that prices will fall and you can buy them back at some stage in the future for less than you sold, thereby realising a profit. If speculators think that the price of house-builders is going to fall as a result of the sharp downturn in the housing market, they sell the stock short. The more they sell, the more likely it is that they will drive down the price. Thus, short-selling can be a self-fulfilling prophecy if the scale is large enough to outweigh buyers. </p> <p>This has been a particular problem of late regarding some banks such as Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays, Bradford &amp; Bingley and HBOS, that announced rights issues. Short-sellers have been charged with trying to drive the share prices down below the rights price, thus forcing a re-pricing of the issue and the <a href=\"http://www.fsa.gov.uk/pages/Library/Communication/PR/2008/057.shtml\">FSA recently stepped</a> in to require short-sellers to declare any short position of over 0.25% of the share capital. </p> <p>In the last few days it has reached dramatic proportions. We know that the Lehman Brothers' share price was pushed down so far that they filed for bankruptcy. AIG, the US insurance company, has been forced to seek federal aid. Yesterday HBOS started the day at just over \u00a32 a share and by 9am was down to under \u00a31. On Wednesday, it was announced that Lloyds are making a bid to take over HBOS. Today it could be the Royal Bank of Scotland that is facing problems. </p> <p>This may seem strange. How can you possibly sell something you don't own? Leaving aside the use of contracts for difference, and naked shorting where you sell a share you don't own, the way it is done is that a short-seller borrows the stock from someone who does own it (usually a large financial institution) and then sells it, hoping to buy it back cheaper. The lender of the stock gets a small fee for making it available and generally keeps any dividends. </p> <p>This is bizarre. Why would institutions such as a pension fund or investment manager, which may have a large holding in a bank or housebuilder, want to lend its stock to a hedge fund to help them drive down the price of its holdings? OK, they get the stock back eventually, but they are worth much less if the shorters are successful in driving down the price. </p> <p>I have no problem with people selling their own shares, if they think will fall in value. But why on earth do financial institutions lend their stock to hedge funds to sell so that it <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idUKLH11568720080917\">falls in value</a>? This seems a pointless exercise, of little or no benefit for the institutions or their investors.</p> <p>Yesterday, the US securities and exchange commission (SEC) announced new rules, which force short-sellers to deliver the shares within three days or face penalties and prohibit short-sellers lying about their positions or ability to deliver the shares they have sold. Christopher Cox, the chairman of the <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2008/2008-209.htm\">SEC stated yesterday</a>: \"The SEC has zero tolerance for abusive naked short-selling.\" Surely this is too little, too late? </p> <p>Freedman also argues that restrictions on short-selling now are shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted. To some extent, this is correct, but it is not an argument for doing nothing. Restrictions should have been put in force months ago. </p> <p>In 2002, the Financial Services Authority <a href=\"http://www.fsa.gov.uk/pubs/discussion/dp17.pdf\">conducted a review (pdf)</a> of short-selling, which concluded that it was beneficial to the efficiency of the market.</p> <p>It is time that they thought again. The financial institutions that own the shares should also put a stop to the practice of lending them out to short-sellers. We are at the point where speculative short-sellers are threatening the stability of the entire financial system, and with it, everybody's savings and the economy as a whole.</p> <p><strong>Late news update:</strong> far be it from me to claim any credit, but just now (September 18, 18:30) <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/16102460-85a0-11dd-a1ac-0000779fd18c.html\">ft.com is reporting</a> that the FSA is about to announce new rules outlawing short-selling.

  "<p>Those old computers Americans discard often end up in developing countries, bridging the so-called digital divide - when they work.</p> <p>But there's a dark side to computer exports in which children are threatened by open-air burning of hazardous metals and the \"acid baths\" used to recover bits of gold, a report from the US government accountability office report said yesterday.</p> <p>The report put the blame on the US environmental protection agency, saying the anti-pollution agency has done little to stem illegal exports of old computers and other e-waste by unscrupulous \"recyclers\" to places like China and west Africa.</p> <p>The scathing report by Congress's investigative arm - which the EPA disputes - was initiated after complaints by advocacy groups and a series by the St Louis Post-Dispatch newspaper in 2006 detailing the activities of some e-waste brokers and exporters.</p> <p>Despite evidence of harm, the government report said, the EPA has all but ignored its own 2007 rule clamping down on computer-monitor exports, refusing even to set a timetable to develop an enforcement program.</p> <p>\"To date, the agency has established no enforcement targets, done no monitoring, conducted only preliminary follow-up of suspected violations and taken only one enforcement action\" - five months after the GAO told the agency about the case, the report found.</p> <p>As part of the newspaper series, the Post-Dispatch reported from Nigeria that roughly three-fourths of the thousands of discarded computers arriving monthly in that west African nation are in bad shape or beyond repair, creating messes that pollute the air and land in one of the world's poorest countries. E-waste contains mercury, lead, cadmium and dangerous flame retardants.</p> <p>The series also showed how Americans can become victims at the hands of identity thieves in foreign lands who retrieve social security numbers and other personal information from discarded computers.</p> <p>The GAO report focused primarily on dumping in Asian countries, with its investigators posing as foreign buyers of broken computer terminals. </p> <p>Responding to fictitious e-mails, 43 US companies expressed willingness to export the non-working computers in apparent violation of EPA rules - including companies \"that publicly tout their exemplary environmental practices\", the investigators reported.</p> <p>Unlike European nations, the US allows export of most e-waste, such as computer hard drives, printers and old cell phones. The government has estimated that as much as 80% of electronic garbage collected for recycling ends up in foreign lands.</p> <p>Starting in January of 2007, a new EPA rule applying only to computer monitors which contain about four pounds of lead \u2014 required notification of EPA by exporters and consent of receiving countries.</p> <p>The GAO report noted that since the rule went into effect, Hong Kong officials alone intercepted and returned 26 containers of illegally exported computer monitors but that the EPA had fined just one exporter, a California company.</p> <p>The EPA contested the GAO report, even the title: EPA Needs to Better Control Harmful US Exports Through Stronger Enforcement and More Comprehensive Regulation. </p> <p>In a letter to the GAO, the EPA defended its use of voluntary and \"non-regulatory approaches\" to controlling e-waste exports, arguing that broader rules could take years to take effect.</p> <p>EPA spokesman Tim Lyons added yesterday that his agency had opened 20 investigations in 18 months since the computer-monitor rule went into effect. </p> <p>\"We're certainly committed to improving the compliance and improving the enforcement,\" he said.</p> <p>The report is expected to hasten broader export controls in Congress but perhaps not soon.<br>Noting \"implications for international health problems\", Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, introduced legislation yesterday that would impose an outright ban on e-waste exports.</p> <p>But Representative Gene Green, a Texas Democrat, who heads the House environment subcommittee on hazardous materials and who has proposed similar legislation, told reporters that such efforts this late in Congress amount to \"laying down markers\" and that he doesn't expect serious congressional efforts until 2009.</p>",
  "<p>Arctic sea ice has reached the second lowest extent ever recorded, according to the US national snow and ice centre, and a new map shows how far the 2008 melt has receded compared to the historical average. </p> <p>The map, produced by Collins, illustrates that the area of ice that is at least five years old has fallen by more than half since 1985. It comes as the Northwest Passage, above north America, and the Northeast Passage, over the top of Russia, are both free of ice for the first time. </p> <p>\"While slightly above the record-low minimum set last year, this season further reinforces the strong negative trend in summer sea ice extent observed during the past 30 years. Before last year, the previous record low for September was set in 2005\", said a spokesman for the Snow and Ice center based at the University of Colorado.</p> <p>A spokesman for WWF International said: \"This means two years in a row of record lows. The trend of melting Arctic sea ice is alarming for the rest of the world. The Arctic is a key factor in stabilising the global climate so this is a global problem that demands an immediate and global response.\"</p> <p>The daily rate of ice loss usually starts to slow in August as the Arctic begins to cool. But in August 2008, the daily decline rate remained steadily downward and strong. </p> <p>The average daily ice loss rate for August 2008 was 78,000 square kilometers (30,000 square miles) per day. This was the fastest rate of daily ice loss that scientists had observed since satellite photographs were started in 1979.</p>",
  "<p>The public finances suffered yet another lurch into the red last month amid warnings of a record deficit this year that would force the next government to raise taxes or cut <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/taxandspending\">spending</a>, or both.</p> <p>There was an overall shortfall of tax revenues relative to spending of \u00a310.2bn in August - the worst August figure since monthly records began in 1993. Economists said the speed of the deterioration, if continued, could push the deficit to \u00a370bn this fiscal year, double the 2007/08 figure and way above the \u00a343bn estimate the chancellor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/alistairdarling\">Alistair Darling</a>, made in the budget in March.</p> <p>A deficit of \u00a370bn would easily exceed the previous record of \u00a351bn set by the Conservative government of John Major in 1993.</p> <p>For the April to August period, the deficit was running \u00a312bn worse than in the same period last year at a deficit of \u00a328bn. And the national debt figures lurched higher as the government's nationalisation of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/northernrock\">Northern Rock</a>'s \u00a387bn of debt came on to the books for the first time, pushing debt up to 43.3% of national income, well above the government's self-imposed 40% ceiling.</p> <p>Excluding Northern Rock, the benchmark stood at 38.3%, although the Treasury is currently reviewing its two main fiscal rules as both are likely to be broken.</p> <p>The government's problem is set to be exacerbated by the downturn in the economy. Figures out on Wednesday showed the biggest rise in unemployment for 16 years in August, which will push down <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/incometax\">income tax</a> receipts and increase benefit payments to the unemployed, pushing the deficit out still further.</p> <p>The government's \u00a32.7bn cost of unwinding the 10p tax debacle, the postponement of fuel duty rises and the temporary scrapping of the starting rate of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/stampduty\">stamp duty</a> for house purchases will all push up the deficit, as will the housing market collapse.</p> <p>This week's 4,500 job losses at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/lehmanbrothers\">Lehman Brothers</a>, combined with other City job losses, are particularly bad news for the public finances because bankers are highly paid and therefore pay a lot of income tax, analysts pointed out.</p> <p>Jonathan Loynes, of Capital Economics, said: \"The state of the public finances continues to go from dreadful to even worse. If this rate of increase is sustained, borrowing will hit \u00a370bn this year.\"</p> <p>The figures show the government is struggling to bring spending growth under control at a time when tax revenues are weakening. </p> <p>\"If recent trends are sustained, borrowing would reach \u00a364bn for the year as a whole. And with the economic outlook likely to worsen over the coming months there is a good chance that the outturn could be even worse,\" said Andrew Goodwin, an economist at the Ernst &amp; Young ITEM Club. </p> <p>Howard Archer, the chief UK and European economist at Global Insight, said the chancellor's predictions had been \"well and truly blown out of the water\".</p> <p>The shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Philip Hammond, said: \"Gordon Brown has built our economy on a mountain of public and private debt, leaving Britain poorly prepared in the face of the current economic crisis. His fiscal rules are now totally discredited. This is yet more evidence of why we need a new fiscal framework to bring the public finances back under control - and a new government to implement it.\"</p> <p>Yvette Cooper, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \"Faced with unprecedented world shocks, it is right that we increase <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/governmentborrowing\">borrowing</a> this year to help support the economy. We are cutting taxes by over \u00a34bn for low and middle income families, and maintaining public sector investment to help families and the economy through these tougher times.\"</p>",
  "<p>At least seven African countries or regions have cut the number of malaria deaths by half following an intensive drive to protect people from the disease, the World Health Organisation said today.</p> <p>Measures to combat malaria included bed nets, the treatment of those who fall sick and the elimination of malaria-carrying mosquitos, the WHO said.</p> <p>The success stories include Eritrea, Rwanda and the island of Sao Tome and Principe, which are not only managing to prevent and treat malaria but also have good data on cases and deaths. </p> <p>In a report on the global burden of the disease, published today, the WHO says more countries may be bringing death rates down but do not yet have statistical proof.</p> <p>\"With dramatic increases in funding and intense momentum towards reducing the malaria burden in recent years, we have a greater need for reliable information and analysis,\" said the WHO director general, Margaret Chan. </p> <p>\"Progress in malaria control has accelerated dramatically since 2006, especially in the wake of the UN secretary general's call for universal malaria control coverage by the end of 2010. We expect these expanded efforts to be reflected in future reports.\" </p> <p>The report, which covers the years 2004 to 2006, reveals a mixed picture in most countries and a big mountain to climb. </p> <p>It estimates there were 247 million people infected and an estimated 881,000 deaths in 2006. Nearly all who died (91%) were in Africa, and 85% were children under the age of five.</p> <p>There is now general agreement on a package of measures to fight malaria.</p> <p>But drugs, bed nets and sprays are slow to get to where they are needed, particularly in the worst-hit areas of Africa. Their coverage is far short of the 80% target for coverage set by the WHO.</p> <p>Surveys in 18 African countries have revealed that 34% of households own an insecticide-treated bed net but they are not always used to protect the most vulnerable - only 23% of children and 27% of pregnant women slept under a net.</p> <p>A new class of antimalarial drugs, the artimisinin compounds, have been recommended for universal use because growing resistance in the malaria parasite has rendered old drugs useless. </p> <p>In the 18 African countries surveyed, less than half the children with fever - 38% - got any treatment with antimalarials, and only 3% were given artimisinin therapy.</p> <p>Indoor spraying to kill malarial mosquitos has regained acceptability, but only five African countries reported sufficient insecticide spraying to protect at least 70% of the people at risk.</p>",

  "<p>The world's leading central banks made a fresh attempt today to ease the growing stress in the world's money markets, taking coordinated action to provide $180bn (\u00a3100bn) in extra liquidity.</p> <p>After the unwillingness of banks to lend to each other led to acute shortages of funds in short-term dollar markets, the Federal Reserve announced that the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, the Swiss National Bank, the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England would all provide extra funding in short-term US dollar markets. The Fed is lending other central banks dollars so that they can pump extra liquidity into markets in Europe, Asia and North America.</p> <p>Cash-strapped banks scrambled to take up the money, which was offered this morning in an auction. But while stockmarkets rallied on the news, analysts warned that any relief could be brief.</p> <p>\"Funding had to be added today \u2026 but will it encourage lending and an end to the ossification of the money market? Until that happens in all major markets we will be locked into a market as unpredictable as a rabid hound,\" warned Stephen Pope, chief global market strategist of Cantor Fitzgerard.</p> <p>The Fed said in a statement that the move was \"designed to address the continued elevated pressures in US dollar short-term funding markets. These measures, together with other actions taken in the last few days by individual central banks, are designed to improve the liquidity conditions in global financial markets. The central banks continue to work together closely and will take appropriate steps to address the ongoing pressures.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor\">Bank of England</a> is making $40bn available, with the ECB increasing its funding by $55bn and the Swiss National Bank offering $15bn. The Bank of Japan will lend $60bn and the Bank of Canada will provide $10bn.</p> <p><strong>Some relief</strong></p> <p>The move, announced at 8am BST, appeared to bring some relief to the troubled markets in Europe and Asia. The FTSE 100, which has fallen into negative territory, was up 1.1% or 53.3 points at 4965.7 in afternoon trading, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index reversed a 7% fall in late trading to close almost unchanged.</p> <p>In a separate response to the crisis, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/feedarticle/7807366\">Russia's president Dmitry Medvedev said the country would spend up to 500bn roubles (\u00a310.9bn) to stabilise its market</a>. The Russian stockmarkets remained closed today for a second day.</p> <p>\"The single biggest priority right now is to prevent a run on the banks,\" explained Chris Weafer, chief strategist at brokerage Uralsib.</p> <p>Today's coordinated action from the Fed is a response to the problems banks are facing when they seek to secure short-term funding in the money markets. Up until the start of the credit crunch a year ago, financial institutions were able to borrow money at rates only slightly higher than the official interest rates set by central banks, but this process has become far more expensive since August 2007.</p> <p>The funding crisis has become particularly acute in dollar markets this week following the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the takeover of Merrill Lynch and the nationalisation of insurance giant AIG.</p> <p>In its share of the operation, the Bank of England will offer to lend each day US dollar funds overnight against eligible collateral, with the first auction of funds taking place today. \"The amount offered in each repo operation will initially be $40bn,\" the Bank said in a statement. \"This amount will be reviewed on a regular basis, in consultation with the other central banks.\"</p> <p>Yesterday, in a U-turn, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/18/bankofenglandgovernor.banking\">the Bank of England extended its existing emergency lending scheme for another six months</a>.</p>",
  "<p>With banks hoarding their cash and unwilling to lend to each other, the world's central banks were today <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/18/marketturmoil1\">forced to step in</a> to provide funds to prevent the international financial system from seizing up.</p> <p>The injection of $180bn is the latest attempt by central bankers to coordinate their response to the financial crisis. In December, they joined forces to boost dollar liquidity around the world after interest rate reductions in the US, the UK and Canada failed to ease concerns about bank lending. Analysts expect further interventions.</p> <p>\"There's a complete lack of faith in the markets,\" said Jim O'Neill, the chief economist at Goldman Sachs in London. \"There's a lot of cash-hoarding and people losing trust in banks, so the central banks are acting to relieve that. This might not be the last time they have to act.\"</p> <p>Until the start of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">credit crunch</a> just over a year ago, financial institutions were able to borrow money at rates only slightly higher than the official interest rates set by central banks. This process has become far more expensive since August 2007, hence the need for central banks to intervene.</p> <p>With the markets in turmoil, investors are turning to governments and the financial authorities to restore calm and a sense of confidence. In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Centre in New York, the markets turned to the US Federal Reserve and its chairman, Alan Greenspan. He duly obliged by slashing US interest rates to make sure the financial wheels kept turning.</p> <p>As governments step in to pick up the pieces after the market excesses of the past decade, questions will be asked as to whether national and international monetary authorities could have acted earlier to head off the present crisis. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/imf\">International Monetary Fund</a> has a mandate to oversee the global financial system and monitors the economic policies of its 185 member countries. It is supposed to act as an <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/surv.htm\">early warning system for the markets</a>.</p> <p>In every financial crisis, the familiar refrain goes up that IMF surveillance should be strengthened. However, when it does issue warnings, few people seem to take heed. In April, Alistair Darling, the British chancellor, issued the now familiar call for the IMF to be strengthened to make sure it remained credible and could prevent future crises.</p> <p>At the IMF/World Bank spring annual meetings, Darling said: \"The IMF must focus its surveillance more closely on financial sector issues and on the links between developments in the financial sector and the real economy.\"</p> <p>Similar calls were heard at the time of the Asian financial crisis in 1998 and the Latin American debt crisis in the early 1980s and even earlier. To give the IMF its due, the fund did warn back in April in its regular <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/gfsr/2008/01/index.htm\">global financial stability report</a> that the sub-prime crisis had the potential for a nasty spill-over beyond the US. It can be fairly assumed, however, that the IMF - like so many others - were surprised by how all-pervasive the crisis would be.</p> <p>The report's executive summary said: \"IMF executive directors agreed with staff that what began as a fairly contained deterioration in portions of the US sub-prime market has spilled over rapidly into severe dislocations in broader credit and funding markets that now pose risks to the macroeconomic outlook in the United States and globally.\"</p> <p>In October last year, the outgoing IMF managing director, Rodrigo de Rato, who has been succeeded by Dominique Strauss-Kahn, found himself on the defensive when the fund was accused of being \"asleep at the wheel\" over the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/subprimecrisis\">sub-prime crisis</a>. Finance ministers from developing countries publicly criticised the IMF for failing to spot the problems in the US and called for \"even-handed implementation\" of the IMF's surveillance programme.</p> <p>Their point was that the IMF treated the rich countries with kid gloves while the poor countries were told to adopt austerity measures when they got into trouble. Developing country ministers said they were tired of being lectured about their shaky financial systems by rich countries. In light of what has gone on in the past few weeks, it seems they had a point.</p> <p>While the IMF can ring its alarm bells, the fund's most powerful shareholder - the US - can disregard its advice. Only now that some of Wall Street's mightiest names have been humbled has the US started to consider measures to curb past excesses.</p>",
  "<h2>THE QUESTION</h2> <p><strong>How have food fashions changed?</strong></p> <p>The evolving menus at high-profile restaurants are a good clue to changing food fashions. This month, the restaurant at London's <strong>Oxo Tower</strong> is celebrating its twelfth birthday. It is marking the occasion with a 12-course tasting menu, featuring a dish from each year it has been open. A quick glance at the menu shows that our tastes have changed dramatically over the last decade.</p> <p>So did we want to tuck into then, and what tastes good now? Amazingly, in the nineties Britons were still in thrall to French cuisine. Foie gras featured in the dish from 1997, and frogs' legs and snails were key over the next couple of years. But by the end of the decade, the long years of French dominance were coming to an end \u2026</p> <p>At the turn of the millennium, a new cuisine was the talk of the town: Japanese. From 2000 to 2003, the Oxo menu was full of wasabi, edamame and enoki mushrooms, following the popularity of the jet set's favourite restaurant, Nobu. This cuisine complemented the noughties' obsession with food and health: 'superfoods' like seaweed were <em>de rigeur</em>. The exoticism and exclusivity associated with Japanese food was an added appeal. But by the time sushi appeared in Sainsbury's, the fashion pack had long since moved on.</p> <p>In recent years, it's all been about British food. The focus has moved to the provenance of the ingredients, and the buzzwords are regional, seasonal, simple, fresh. The Oxo dish from 2004 encapsulates the new mood: Yorkshire venison with black pudding and pumpkin. Later dishes feature mead, oatcakes, wild strawberries, clotted cream: bygone English summers on a plate.</p> <p>Nibbles hopes that our newfound pride in our food heritage is no passing fad, and British fare stays firmly in fashion.</p> <p><em>The Oxo Tower tasting menu is available until October 31. Reservations can be <a href=\"http://www.harveynichols.com/output/Page387.asp\">made online</a></em></p> <h2>IN SEASON</h2> <p><strong>Buffalo mozzarella</strong></p> <p>OK, we're cheating a tiny bit, because mozzarella doesn't have a season as such \u2013 it's just best eaten as fresh as possible. But early autumn is a particularly good time, as the water buffalo have gorged on lush grass all summer. You may be lucky enough to find fresh buffalo mozzarella at your local farmers' market (we like <a href=\"http://www.buffalo-organics.co.uk/\">Alham Wood Cheeses</a> from Somerset). If not, befriend your local Italian deli owner to find out when the mozzarella is delivered, so you can get it at its best.</p> <p>Mozzarella is a particularly chic cheese at the moment \u2013 neophiles have dubbed it 'the new sushi' \u2013 and its popularity is reflected in one of this month's new openings. <strong>Obika</strong> is the second London outpost of a mozzarella bar (the other branch is in Selfridges) that was first found Rome, Milan and Turin. Mozzarella aficionados can choose cheeses from different regions, or sample a smoked version, affumicata. For full marks in the fashionable food stakes, plump for burrata, a super-creamy mozzarella beloved by the gorgeous Giorgio Locatelli.</p> <p><em>Find more information at <a href=\"http://www.obika.it/english/\">obika.co.uk</a></em> </p> <h2>CRITIC'S QUOTE</h2> <p>At the Modern Pantry, it's the food itself that stops the conversation, a reminder that in skilled hands, this kind of fusion food can transcend passing fashion to be a design classic.<br><em><a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/reviews/global-a-gogo-the-modern-pantry-926744.html\">Tracey MacLeod reviews the Modern Pantry</a>, London EC1</em></p> <h2>BEST BUY</h2> <p>Editors refuelling between shows this week (all those parties are exhausting, darling) should try <a href=\"http://www.divinechocolate.com\">Divine's</a> <strong>white chocolate with strawberries</strong>.

  "<p>\"Is it a debate for now?\" asked Nick Clegg, Lib Dem leader and ex-MEP, of British entry to the euro. \"No. I think it's off the radar screen,\" he said at his party's annual conference this week. Like Gordon Brown, he gave the stock response to the decade-long question: \"We'll join when the time is right.\"</p> <p>Even in this era of wild <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/currencies\">currency fluctuations</a> and financial meltdown, there's no appetite in Britain for joining the single currency. But, in Nice last weekend for the informal meeting of EU finance ministers and a heavyweight conference on financial supervision organised by thinktank Eurofi, there was the exotic whiff of an <em>amuse-bouche</em>.</p> <p>At a crowded pre-dinner cocktail of champagne and canapes in a hotel on the Promenade des Anglais, a senior British (Labour) MEP suggested, in all seriousness, that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/recession\">economic downturn in Britain</a> would be so protracted and the slump in the pound so profound that the next government would take steps to join the euro.</p> <p>And, who would initiate this historic process? David Cameron and George Osborne, leaders of the most avowedly eurosceptic Conservatives ever. Ridiculous? Well, a senior EU official and a banking regulator I bumped into later were far from dismissive and I've often thought that, as political and economic events unfold in the next decade, it would be the Tories who would be forced to end the UK's 60-year position in Europe of opt-in-opt-out. Prodded by Alex Salmond, Scotland's nationalist first minister, who would love to take his country into the euro if it ever wins independence.</p> <p>Now, in research published this week by Chatham House, a commission of the great and the good readdresses the issue of Britain and the euro and the prospect that, by the middle of the next decade, the UK could be in a minority of one, two or maybe three outside a eurozone of up to 25 member countries. Unsurprisingly, the conclusions are balanced, nuanced and ambivalent.</p> <p>On the one hand, the authors reject the notion that Britain should give up the pound simply to avoid \"losing influence\" among EU economic policymakers, especially the eurogroup which increasingly dominates debates and coordinates policy responses. They are unconvinced that the eurozone will in future see a greater convergence in terms of business cycles, growth rates, inflation and unemployment than in its first 10 years.</p> <p>On the other hand, they say, the eurozone has acted as a \"safe haven\" in the credit crunch and as a bulwark against the turmoil that would have arisen were the lira and peseta, say, still traded. \"The stability offered by the euro would be especially welcome if, over the next ten to 20 years, the British economic performance deteriorated relative to that of the eurozone for a sustained period.\"</p> <p>In a nod to the (next, presumably Conservative) government, they say Britain \"may need to reconsider its position and appeal to the pragmatic self-interest of the electorate over giving up the pound\" if economic conditions continue to worsen. Meantime, Gordon and Alistair Darling should reinstate the annual review of the \"five tests\" and potential benefits of membership, promoting a wider public debate.</p> <p>This will be anathema to eurosceptics who will continue to argue about divergent economic performances, a one-size-fits-all interest rate policy and the loss of monetary sovereignty. But, as the UK pays the cost of easy credit and tries belatedly to rebalance its economy, joining a currency now accounting for almost 30% of global reserves could be a sound option. Maybe, after all, Cameron and Osborne muse about it as they face the nightmare of taking over an economy that can no longer claim to be the model for the rest of the EU.</p> <p><strong>Half a minister</strong></p> <p>The eurozone will have 16 members on January 1 when Slovakia joins and the EU, of course, has 27. But, in Nice, at the Ecofin meeting, it felt as usual as if it were 26.5. Darling came and went, giving a few very brief and anodyne comments to agency reporters, while his colleagues, central bank governors and EU commissioners reported back regularly to journalists.</p> <p>Peer Steinbrueck, German finance minister, gave a three-hour post-dinner briefing in his hotel to German journalists and held forth outside in the sun to them and others, including myself, on two or three more occasions. Colleagues from other EU countries, including Italy, Spain, Ireland and Sweden, enjoyed similar access.</p> <p>It's standard practice for them. My sole contact with the British delegation was an entirely fruitless five-minute conversation with a Treasury spokeswoman whose clear brief was to say nothing. Subsequent phone calls went unanswered. Indeed, I'm still waiting for a reply to messages I left. Treasury communications policy on the EU and its policy response to the current financial crisis appears to be founded on <em>omerta</em>. Or disdain.</p> <p><strong>A reforming character</strong></p> <p>Christine Lagarde, France's finance minister, chaired the Ecofin meeting with, apparently, Gallic rigour. A former New York-based lawyer, she allotted keynote speakers such as Jean-Claude Trichet, ECB president, strict timetables and topics and kept them in order.</p> <p>Tall, elegant, with an engaging smile, Lagarde broke with domestic tradition at the Eurofi dinner and spoke English fluently, with a mixture of finesse and down-to-earthness. She made some funny jokes. But, it seems, her penchant for reforms, more particularly for promoting them off her own back, has ruffled feathers in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e presidential palace. Sarko, it's said, is displeased at her usurping his role as sole architect of reforming France. She may not survive, a French banker whispered in my ear.</p> <p><strong>A dry reception</strong></p> <p>One French reform is thoroughly suspect and unwelcome. Dignitaries attending a reception at the Mus\u00e9e Mass\u00e9na, an opulent former princely villa, were kept kicking their heels for 40 minutes outside until the mayor arrived. Inside at last, they headed for the drinks tables set out in the formal gardens. <em>Jus d'orange, eau ou Cola, monsieur</em>? Non, merci, une coupe de champagne<em>.</em> <em>Il n'y a pas d'alcool, monsieur</em>. Another edict from the teetotal Sarko? The reception was short-lived.</p>",
  "<p>Shares on India's main stock market went on a rollercaster ride today \u2013 plunging more than 5% in early trading only to recover after the country's finance minister gave a public vote of confidence in the banking sector.<br> Earlier in the day foreign funds fled Indian shares over concerns that the global <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">credit crunch</a> would damage the bottom lines of many banks. After comments by the finance minister, Palaniappan Chidambaram, domestic investors returned to the market.<br> The benchmark Sensex index, based on the 30 largest companies on the Mumbai stock market, closed 12.47 points or 0.1% lower at 13518.80 points - recovering more than 450 points from the day's low of 13051.73. The stock rally came after Chidambaram said there is no cause for alarm as Indian banks were largely insulated from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/wallstreet\">crisis that has gripped the US financial system</a>. <br> \"Let me assure everyone there is no cause for any alarm that any Indian bank is exposed or vulnerable like a couple of banks that have failed in the United States,'' he said. Chidambaram, who was a widely respected corporate lawyer, also re-iterated the government's stance to pump funds into the banking sector if required. The effect was almost immediate. The State Bank of India, the nation's largest lender, rebounded from a 7% dip to close up 6.5% at 1,585.50 rupees (\u00a319). Analysts had feared that ICICI bank, which has consolidated assets of $103bn (\u00a355bn), was exposed to high levels of Lehman debt. By the market close, the bank's shares gained 2% \u2013 a marked gain after a week which had seen ICICI's market capitalisation drop by 14%. After the market closed the bank said it may have to set aside an additional $28m to cover losses on investments in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/lehmanbrothers\">Lehman Brothers</a> securities in Britain.<br> The finance minister also made it clear that two insurance joint ventures between Tata group and American International Group, which had to be rescued by the US government this week, will not be affected.  Both have assured India's insurance regulator that they have sufficient funds to meet all obligations, the minister said. Chidambaram also sounded bullish on growth \u2013 saying that India's economy would grow at around 8% this year. Despite the finance minister's comments, there is enough evidence that the meltdown on Wall Street has already hit Indian workers. More than 2,500 Lehman employees in the country will lose their jobs.  In the longer term, many of India's brightest corporate stars in the information technology sector, which have lucrative contracts on Wall Street, may have to shrink wage rolls. Satyam, an Indian software giant, has repeated denied rumours it would fire 9% of its workforce \u2013 about 4,500 people \u2013 in recent days. Satyam shares closed more than 4% down at 335 rupees. Many in the industry predict a bloodbath. Shiva Ramani, chief executive officer of Cybernet-SlashSupport (CSS), told reporters that the job losses due to the current crisis could see 15,000 people in the Indian IT industry lose their jobs over the next six months.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown today said the government had taken \"decisive and quick action\" to protect Britain's financial system following the threat to Halifax Bank of Scotland.</p> <p>In an interview with Sky, the prime minister appeared to take some credit for facilitating the merger between HBOS and Lloyds TSB.</p> <p>He also promised to take action to deal with \"irresponsible behaviour\" in the City.</p> <p>Until today ministers have played down their role in the merger that has rescued HBOS, Britain's biggest mortgage lender.</p> <p>But today Brown suggested that the government was instrumental in enabling it to go ahead.</p> <p>\"I believe that we have taken not only the right action, but by taking that action we have brought more stability to the financial system,\" the prime minister said.</p> <p>He said that the deal would not have been able to go ahead if the government had not taken action to ease the competition laws that in normal circumstances would have prevented a merger on this scale going ahead.</p> <p>\"This was a deal that took place between two companies. We had to deal with those issues of competition,\" he said.</p> <p>Brown went on: \"I also believe we have got to deal with the other problems, and that includes mistakes that were made in the past, cleaning up the financial system.</p> <p>\"We have got to look at where there has been irresponsible behaviour.

  "<p>September 17 will go down as the blackest day for Scottish finance in 300 years. HBOS, Scotland's second largest company, is to be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/18/marketturmoil.hbosbusiness\">merged</a> into a London-based monolith called Lloyds Halifax. What's more, there are rumours circulating in the City that Scotland's largest financial institution, Royal Bank of Scotland, may shortly be merged with HSBC. It doesn't get much worse. The two pillars of the Scottish economy are crumbling before our eyes. </p> <p>The first minister of Scotland, Alex Salmond, has <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/7621153.stm\">laid into</a> the \"spivs and speculators\" who allegedly brought Halifax Bank of Scotland to its knees. </p> <p>There was real passion here; Salmond is a former banker himself, an oil economist with the Royal Bank of Scotland before he went into politics, and he takes this personally. You felt that he was ready to get tooled up and go visit a few hedge funds.</p> <p>But also in his sights is the Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, for arranging so precipitately what Salmond called a \"shotgun marriage\" of HBOS and Lloyds TSB. Though Salmond didn't say so openly, many in the Scottish National Party suspect a degree of English perfidy in the manner in which this great Scottish institution appears to have been \"bought and sold for English gold\" to quote Burns.</p> <p>There is potentially a huge sense of national grievance here. The Bank of Scotland has emotional significance almost equal to its financial clout. It was set up under an Act of the old Scottish Parliament in 1695, 12 years before the Act of Union. It was the first European bank to successfully issue its own bank notes, a function it retains to this day. But perhaps not for much longer. The Bank of Scotland was tainted by association with the Jacobite rising in 1715, which led indirectly to the loss of its banking monopoly and to the creation of the Royal Bank of Scotland in 1727. Rivalry between the two banks \u2013 which are by far the two largest companies in Scotland \u2013 has waxed and waned for nearly three centuries.</p> <p>Even after it merged with Halifax in 2001 to form Britain's largest mortgage-lender and fourth largest clearing bank, HBOS was still regarded as a great Scottish institution. Its massive Roman Baroque headquarters on Edinburgh's Mound has dominated Scotland's capital city since 1806. There was gallows humour on the Mound yesterday among the hacks posted on death-watch outside the building. \"It would make an awfy nice hotel, wouldn't it?\"<br> Well, it could come to that. The new Lloyds Halifax superbank will almost certainly have its headquarters in <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article4776672.ece\">London</a>.</p> <p>This will be fought bitterly by the Scottish Government, and by many in the opposition parties. HBOS employs 17,000 people in Scotland, and it dominates the financial sector which has been the growth area in the Scottish economy since the departure of the electronics industry in the Nineties. The nationalists are adamant that, under an independent Scotland, such a loss would be unconscionable. But the reality is that an independent Scottish government would have been pretty powerless against the global financial holocaust which brought HBOS to its knees. </p> <p>Alex Salmond suggests that the regulators should have stepped in to bolster HBOS; that the FSA had ruled it to be a sound and solvent institution, and it should have stuck to its guns. The short sellers, or \"spivs and speculators\" could have been fought off, he believes, by determined government action to protect the integrity of HBOS. Perhaps. But equally, HBOS's fate could have been similar to Northern Rock, and that would have been an even greater national humiliation. Even the United States government has been powerless to halt the destructive domino effect that has decimated Wall St and has now spread to the City of London and the City of Edinburgh. </p> <p>The truth is that HBOS is not the canny and prudent institution that existed before the merger with Halifax in 2001. It became intoxicated with securitisation and became dependent on the wholesale markets for much of its mortgage finance. It bought heavily into American sub-prime mortgages and started throwing big money at the UK mortgage market, which is now in meltdown. </p> <p>Perhaps if the Bank of Scotland had stuck to its old fashioned banking practices, which stood it in good stead for nearly three centuries, it would still be standing today, and perhaps picking through the carrion of other fallen banks. But no one can turn the clock back, and this is beginning to look like the end of another \"auld sang\".</p>",
  "<p><strong>Philip Shaw</strong> at <strong>Investec</strong> said: \"August's public finances disappointed yet again, net borrowing (PSNB) hitting \u00a310.4bn in August against market expectations of \u00a39.0bn. So far in 2007/08 the deficit has been running at \u00a32.3bn per month above last year's levels, which if maintained over the remainder of the year implies that net borrowing would reach \u00a364bn, \u00a321bn above Alistair Darling's forecast in the March budget.</p> <p>\"This reinforces the impression that the chancellor will have to suspend or modify the fiscal rules when he delivers the pre-budget report, expected towards the end of next month. Also note that the Northern Rock debt is now fully incorporated into the public sector, so that net public sector debt has been pushed up by \u00a385bn and is now estimated to be \u00a3633bn, or 43.3% of GDP, above the cyclical ceiling of 40% set by the government's sustainable investment rule.\"</p> <p><strong>John Hawksworth</strong> at <strong>PwC</strong> said: \"Today's public finance numbers will make more gloomy reading for the chancellor ahead of the pre-budget report. The adverse effect of the economic downturn on tax revenues now looks set to push the budget deficit up to around \u00a350-55bn this year even if the Treasury can keep public spending in line with its budget plans.\"</p> <p><strong>Howard Archer</strong> at <strong>Global Insight</strong> said: \"The public finances were substantially weaker in August compared to a year earlier, adding to the chancellor's massive problems as he prepares his pre-budget report that is due in October.</p> <p>\"The public finances are being battered by the economic slowdown, and they are also being undermined by government policy concessions. Sharply weaker economic activity will take an increasing toll on VAT and corporation tax receipts, while extremely low housing market activity and markedly falling house prices are hitting stamp duty receipts (even before the government's exemption for a year of the payment of 1.0% stamp duty on the purchase of properties costing up to \u00a3175,000).</p> <p>\"Consequently, the chancellor's aim in the March budget to keep the Public Sector Net Borrowing Requirement (PSNBR) down to \u00a343.0 billion in 2008/09 and the current budget deficit down to \u00a310.0 billion have been well and truly blown out of the water. These shortfalls were based on expected GDP growth of 1.75-2.25% in 2008 and 2.25-2.75% in 2009. In contrast, Global Insight expects GDP growth to be just 1.1% in 2008 and 0.1% in 2009, and the downside risks to these forecasts are mounting. Consequently, the PSNBR looks in very real danger of reaching \u00a360.0 billion in 2008/09 and the prospects for 2009/2010 look even worse as things currently stand.\"</p> <p><strong>Jonathan Loynes</strong> at <strong>Capital Economics</strong> said: \"The \u00a310.4bn PSNB total in August brought the cumulative deficit in the first five months of the year up to \u00a328.2bn compared to last year's \u00a316.5bn. If this rate of increase is sustained, borrowing will hit \u00a370bn this year.\"</p>",

  "<p><strong>Howard Archer</strong> at <strong>Global Insight</strong> said: \"Frankly these retail sales data are hard to believe and probably need to be taken with a huge pinch of salt. The data seem very much at odds with the survey evidence coming from both the British Retail Consortium and the CBI as well as the news coming from most retailers.</p> <p>\"Regardless of what the hard data show, the prospects for consumer spending over the coming months look bleak. Consumers are being hit left, right and centre. Furthermore, the current heightened financial sector turmoil is likely to further depress spending.</p> <p>\"At face value, the jump in retail sales in August dilutes the case for an interest rate cut in the near-term, particularly given current elevated inflation levels and risks. Nevertheless, the Bank of England has expressed reservations about the recent accuracy of the retail sales data and is unlikely to be hugely influenced by the reported marked rise in sales in August.\" </p> <p><strong>Stephen Robertson</strong>, director general of the <strong>British Retail Consortium</strong>, said: \"These unexpectedly resilient figures fail to convey how tough conditions are for customers and retailers. Plenty of retailers would be delighted if their sales values were up nearly 4% on a year ago. Fundamental conditions are weakening, not improving, and recent banking industry uncertainty can only make customers more nervous about spending.</p> <p>\"Yes, clothing and footwear sales growth has risen but that growth is modest and driven by discounts. It cannot be called strong and cannot explain ONS' high overall figures. We respect the ONS's process but the Bank of England is right to treat these figures as only one measure of retail performance.\"</p> <p><strong>Richard Lowe</strong>, director of retail and wholesale sectors at <strong>Barclays Commercial Bank</strong>, said: \"Although the figures were stronger than expected in the latest month they, nevertheless, indicate a slowing in annual growth compared to rates enjoyed earlier in the year. Moreover, they also highlight the weakness in those sectors which are most vulnerable to the slowdown in the housing market, such as household goods retailers and department stores where sales have fallen over the past year (by 0.6% and 1.8% respectively).\"</p> <p><strong>David Bush</strong>, head of retail services at <strong>Grant Thornton</strong>, said: \"The reported increase in sales volumes between July and August of 1.2% could only possibly have been achieved by heavy discounting activity by retailers so any increases in sales are unlikely to have translated into meaningful gross profits. The largest increase in sales volumes were in the non-store category of 2.1% between July and August. This reflects the consumer switching to internet purchasing and reducing trips to shops in the face of the recent rises in petrol prices.</p> <p>\"Prudent consumer spending will definitely continue as banks are constricted more than ever in their unsecured lending to customers, unemployment continues to rise and UK shoppers read ever more lurid accounts of the turmoil in the world's financial markets. On this basis, only significant cuts in interest rates in the short term are likely to revive the consumer's appetite for shopping in the crucial run up to Christmas, yet the MPC is clearly constrained by the need to contain underlying rising inflation.\"</p> <p><strong>Philip Shaw</strong> at <strong>Investec</strong> said: \"While nothing would really surprise us in these turbulent times, today's number occupies the same suspicious territory as the 3.9% surge reported in May, which was subsequently followed by a 4.2% slump in June. Note that surveys and anecdotal evidence are looking very soft \u2013 for example the reported sales balance in August's CBI distributive trades survey hit its lowest level in the survey's 25-year history. A significant reversal in next month's figures looks likely, and we doubt that the MPC will place much weight on today's numbers.\"</p> <p><strong>Jonathan Loynes</strong> at <strong>Capital Economics</strong> said: \"These figures are still puzzlingly strong compared to the much gloomier message coming from the retail surveys, consumer confidence figures and anecdotal evidence. As such, we suspect that the MPC will treat them with a pinch of salt when considering the overall strength of the household sector.\"</p>",
  "<p>EM Forster's motto was \"<a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=k7xkpDw8HlsC&amp;dq=howard's+end&amp;pg=PP1&amp;ots=Y6i68_vfVo&amp;sig=BAPjiUTMVHf5qdODjJxbxRXlx38&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result\">Only Connect</a>\". Lip service is paid to this essential advice in such notions as \"joined-up government\", but it seems far more honoured in the breach than the observance \u2013 and invariably where its observance would be really, really useful.</p> <p>Take the connections one might make between the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/mortarboard/2008/sep/17/science.religiousstudiesandtheology\">resignation of Michael Reiss</a> from the Royal Society because of his views about creationism in schools, and the opening this week of the first <a href=\"http://www.hindu.com/2008/09/16/stories/2008091657362000.htm\">Hindu faith-based school</a>.</p> <p>One of the Hindu creation myths has Vishnu asleep in the coils of a cobra, itself afloat on a dark ocean whose waves lap the shores of nothingness. After untold aeons of this tranquility a sound of humming began, forming the syllable \"om\", which increased in power and brought the dawn, thereby waking Vishnu. As he woke a lotus sprang from his naval, and in its petals sat Brahma. Vishnu said to Brahma, \"It is time; create the world\".</p> <p>This charming tale is one of many myths told in the equally many religions of the world, the great majority of them long-defunct. It would be appropriate for school history lessons to include a survey of the tales mankind told itself in its infancy, not just for the interest and entertainment value, but because of the references to them in art and literature. No education could be complete, for example, without an understanding of Greek mythology, given its role in our culture; and the same applies to Christianity - itself a version of the much-iterated older myths of a god (Zeus chief among them) who impregnates a mortal maid (Zeus impregnated many) who gives birth to a hero who goes into the underworld and then attains Olympus or heaven. And the theme of return or a promised coming \u2013 <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldr\">Baldr the Beautiful</a>, expected after ragnarok; the Christian second coming; the moshiach (messiah) of Judaism - are mythical likewise, but this time as expressions of mankind's hopes for progress or a better world.</p> <p>There are, alas, those who take these tales literally, and who have died or killed or both in defending them or trying to force other to believe them literally too. Despite them, even so, one would be suspicious of anyone who proposed to teach Hesiod's Theogony or Ovid's Metamorphoses or the Mahabharata or the Epic of Gilgamesh as a textbooks of historical fact. As in all great literature there are insights and instruction to be had from these works; they are rich in allegorical meaning, sometimes it seems unconsciously so. But one would look - one looks - very askance at those who teach the two not especially compatible versions of the Bible's Genesis creation myth as historical fact.</p> <p>Should chemistry and biology teachers devote part of their lessons to explaining why the story of Vishnu and his cobra is not chemistry or biology? In effect this is what - to put the best construction on it - Professor Reiss was trying to suggest. So blindingly obvious is the answer that there can be no surprise that he ceased to be the Royal Society's director of education with such rapidity once he had, speaking more with his clergyman's hat on (for he is a thing now <a href=\"http://www.thefreedictionary.com/rara+avis\">rara avis in terris</a>: a latter-day <a href=\"http://www3.shropshire-cc.gov.uk/kilvert.htm\">Kilvert</a>), proposed the cobra-chemistry idea - though no doubt he had his own tradition's more banal version of it in mind.</p> <p>No one seems to have realised yet that the question of creationist ideas being taught in schools immediately leads to the more general question of how religion is taught in schools - because all religions have their creation myths - and because it is only an accident of history that religion is regarded as somehow more respectable than astrology or ouija boards, despite being no different in degree of credibility than they. The parallel is rather like outlawing marijuana but allowing an equally or even more dangerous drug like alcohol to be legally sold. So, no one suggests astrology should be taught alongside astronomy, or ouija-board technique alongside historical research. Yet the likes of Reiss think that the myths of mankind's infancy about the origin and nature of the world should be discussed alongside science - ! Clearly there is No Connection being made here.</p> <p>But now as to that other Only Connect matter. While controversies arise about creationism, new faith-based schools open: this week's brand-new Hindu school, admitting only vegetarian Hindu children, will provide pupils with an education set in the culture and tradition of the Hindu faith. Does that mean Vishnu in the chemistry lab and his cobra and lotus in the biology lab?</p> <p>The school's head teacher, Naina Parmar, stated a desire to make the school \"a haven of peace. Hinduism is a very inclusive faith, which naturally promotes a calm, caring and cooperative learning environment\". This is an admirable sentiment, and while faith-based schooling lasts - not too long I trust - in this country, let us hope that ambition is realised. But there is nothing inclusive about the strict exclusivity of this particular school, and there is nothing peaceful about the murderous rage with which Hindus and Muslims slaughter each other periodically in India - remember Ayodhya. The words, alas, ring a little hollow.</p> <p>The trap that the government has fallen into with its misguided, divisive, ghettoisation-inviting policy of promoting faith schools is well summed up in the words of the chairman of the new Hindu school's governing body, Nitesh Gor: \"If we are going to continue to have faith schooling in this country it is unreasonable and discriminatory to deny just a handful of Hindu parents the choice that is already available to much larger numbers of Christians, Jews, Muslims, Sikhs and others\". Quite: now everyone wants your and my tax money to bring up their children in their own version of the religions that sit on the creation myths that no sensible person wishes to be passed off on a child as any part of the truth about the world.</p> <p>There is a thus deep paradox in our contemporary society about these matters: the government funds faith-based schools; the sensible majority does not want creationism taught in schools; religion is the vehicle of creationism, despite the cherry-pickers best efforts to distance themselves from the bits they can no longer bring themselves to believe in.</p> <p>The best solution is to put religion where it belongs: in the history curriculum of non-faith-based schools where religion is no longer a compulsory observance at assembly or any other time.</p>",

People of different nationalities and ethnicities have been living in this region side by side for centuries, sharing customs, traditions, bread and wine, and mutual respect for each another's cultures and languages. But, going back to the Russian, British, and Ottoman Empires that once battled here, they have been continually exploited by politicians and generals. </p> <p>Women and children suffer the most in times of conflict. Add to this centuries-old patriarchal traditions, 15-year-old post-war traumas, a 20-year economic crisis, and current Russian aggression, and you may begin to grasp what women in South Ossetia, Abkhazia, and Georgia are enduring these days. </p> <p>Besides the general devastation that modern warfare brings, impoverished and angry Russian soldiers were wreaking havoc on civilians by stealing belongings left behind and raping women. In addition, lawlessness was enticing bandits to cross the border and vandalise and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/14/georgia.russia\">rob properties</a> left by fleeing refugees. News reports and \"analysis\" by state-controlled channels in both Russia and Georgia that promote negative images of \"the enemy\" serve only to widen the gap between ethnic groups. </p> <p>Over the past month, concerned citizens in both Russia and Georgia have started to make attempts to build alliances and reach out to each other outside of the government-controlled media and structures. There have been action calls and statements circulated on the web calling on the people of the region to unite and not allow governments to build bigger walls between them. </p> <p>Despite government propaganda, the region's people must remember that Russians are not superior to Georgians, Georgians to Ossetians or Abkhazians, and so on. We need to stop these territorial battles based on national pride and desire to control and rule. Saakashvili must be pressured to abandon his effort to wield full control over Abkhazia and South Ossetia. At the same time, the Russian government must be pressured to pull out of the Caucasus and let people there decide their future for themselves. </p> <p>Now is the time for Georgian, Russian, Abkazian, and Ossetian civilians who are bearing the brunt of the conflict to come together to stop imperial chess games that kill thousands of people and leave thousands more displaced and emotionally wounded. It is time to help civil society in this area build a world where peace, not warfare, is the rule. </p> <p>Women's rights activists in the region should not fall into a brainwashing trap of nationalism and territorial disputes, becoming another tool in the hands of politicians. They should demonstrate to their governments that they will not succumb to divisive ideology. </p> <p><em> Angelika Arutyunova is programme officer for Europe and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) at the Global Fund for Women.</em></p> <p>Copyright: <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2008.</p>",

  "<p>In typically kneejerk, crowd-pleasing fashion, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/sec-stiffens-rules-naked-short/story.aspx?guid=%7B7789308F-FFD1-40A3-A845-4B99F863CE0C%7D&amp;dist=msr_1\">last night announced</a> a toughening-up of the rules regarding \"naked short-selling\" of US securities, heralding what some see as the beginning of a process to outlaw all forms of short-selling. The practice is commonly cited as having exacerbated the current slump in global stock markets, with Lehman's CEO Dick Fuld apparently <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/darling-faces-call-for-shortselling-crackdown-after-hbos-plunge-933053.html\">threatening</a> to rip the arms off those shorting his company's stock and sending its share price crashing through the floor. However, as any honest trader would assert, short-selling is an entirely legitimate strategy in the jungle that is today's market. </p> <p>Shorting (<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2008/03/21/nhedgie321.xml\">selling stocks</a> the trader doesn't own in the expectation that they can buy them back cheaper later on) has acquired a reputation as the evil twin of \"going long\" on shares in the hope that they will rise in price; however, there is nothing illicit about the technique. </p> <p>There is no fundamental difference between going long or short, since both types of trade are financed on assets being lent: either money or stock. Shorting involves borrowing shares until the settlement period has expired, at which point the shares must be returned; going long involves borrowing money to pay for the shares, which is only repayable at the end of the agreed timeframe. Given their parity, and given that the stock market is heavily driven by the psychological whims of those buying and selling, if someone decides that the share price of a company is about to fall, they have as much right to act on that impulse as anyone anticipating a sudden rise.</p> <p>What is most duplicitous about the proclamations of the SEC, Fuld, and even <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7618096.stm\">Alistair Darling</a>, is the way in which they have chosen to scapegoat short-sellers, purely to deflect attention from their own failure to contain the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree+business/marketturmoil\">financial hurricane</a> currently engulfing bourses. If the mirror situation were in play, with a major bull market in effect, there is little to no chance that they would be complaining that \"naked long\" positions were driving the market higher. </p> <p>During the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble\">dotcom boom</a> of the late 1990s, the years of so-called \"<a href=\"http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Irrational-exuberance\">irrational exuberance</a>\", shares doubled, tripled and even quadrupled in price over the course of a few hours' trading; and while the going was good, the regulators smiled benignly upon the market players from on high. Restrictions on client borrowing were relaxed, customers were encouraged to use <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_(finance)\">margin</a> to take out far larger positions and thus increase brokers' commission rates, and no one batted an eyelid until things turned sour. </p> <p>Anyone caught short during the wild surges of the dotcom years was in danger of losing all their money and more, thanks to the theoretical unlimited downside risk in shorting shares. Despite their losses, they had no one to blame but themselves; it was they who called the market wrong, and they who had to pay the price when the time came to settle their debts. </p> <p>Nowadays, however, there is the absurd demand being made in some quarters that people long of stock who have lost out during this prolonged bear market should be able to lay the blame squarely at the feet of their more savvy peers who bet the other way. Because, to be honest, that is all that trading in today's market boils down to; making bets one way or another on the direction of share prices, index values, oil futures, and any other tradable commodity. As in the world of bookmaking, so in the stock market: for every backer, there is someone out there laying the price; if there wasn't, there wouldn't be a market at all. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2002/nov/17/mbas.highereducation1\">Simon Cawkwell</a>, the most famous short-seller in the City, and the man who first exposed the fraud within <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1249739.stm\">Robert Maxwell's empire</a>, launched a typically scathing attack on the regulators when we spoke after the closing bell yesterday. \"[The proposed rules] are infantile; they are the emotional reaction of children\", he said mockingly.</p> <blockquote> <p>They will have no effect on the market whatsoever, [since] they have nothing to do with real life at all. They are a raft of propositions offered by very silly fools to even sillier fools.</p> </blockquote> <p>Warming to his theme, he suggested that disgruntled investors and taxpayers swivel the barrels of their guns well away from the City, and towards Westminster instead. \"The problem is not short-selling\", he assured me. </p> <blockquote> <p>The problem is the electorate who voted in a <a href=\"http://www.number10.gov.uk/meet-the-pm/biography\">socialist</a> who thought he could run the economy. He talked about 'prudent stability' just to [ensure he became] prime minister; he's a fucking nuisance.</p> </blockquote> <p>Cawkwell's ire is understandable, given that the regulators' anti-shorting overtures threaten the foundations upon which his, and thousands of other short-sellers', business is based. Darling's comment that he is \"extremely anxious that we avoid a situation where people can manipulate markets, causing huge harm that is totally unjustified\" is the stock-market equivalent of anti-immigrant racism; tarring an entire section of society with one brush, in order to unite the hordes of embittered investors in a witchhunt against their undeserving peers. </p> <p>The bottom line is that had the heads of the banking behemoths and their watchdog counterparts exerted more control over the extent of firms' exposure to high-risk debt, there wouldn't have been this degree of bear market (from which short-sellers could profit) in the first place. That no one saw it coming is a tragedy \u2013 for employees, shareholders and everyone else caught up in the crisis \u2013 but to set up straw men in a desperate attempt to play the blame game is wholly disingenuous. </p> <p>Bear raiders like Cawkwell and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Chanos\">James Chanos</a> are as vulnerable to the risks they take as any other investor. They are entitled to make their money in the best way they know how, and to milk as much out of the markets as they can, based on the strength of their instinct and nous. To deny them that opportunity, based on spurious reasoning and political opportunism, is simply shutting the door of the stable five along from the one out of which the horse actually bolted. </p> <p>Furthermore, action such as the SEC has taken, rather than calming the jitters running through the market, actually threatens its stability. But that won't stop them doing it all the same, since in the current climate of fear and loathing, any points that can be scored at all are worth their weight in gold (though perhaps not at <a href=\"http://www.smartmoney.com/breaking-news/smw/index.cfm?story=20080917022355\">this week</a>'s prices), regardless of how cheap or \"childish\" they are.</p>",
  "<p>Mortgage lending fell to its lowest level in more than three years in August, as uncertainty among lenders and consumers gathered pace, figures showed today.</p> <p>A total of \u00a321.8bn was advanced to borrowers during the month - a 12% fall from July and 36% down on last August's figure of \u00a333.9bn, the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) said.</p> <p>This is the lowest monthly figure since April 2005 and the lowest figure for August since 2002. </p> <p>Rumours of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/stampduty\">change in stamp duty</a> and expectations of further falls in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/houseprices\">house prices</a> combined to deter many would-be buyers from entering the housing market in the summer months.</p> <p>The stamp duty changes have now been introduced, meaning <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/property\">property</a> purchases below \u00a3175,000 are exempt from the tax, but there are new clouds on the horizon.</p> <p>This week's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/15/lehmanbrothers.creditcrunch\">collapse of the US bank Lehman Brothers</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/18/hbosbusiness.lloydstsbgroup5\">concerns over the futures of other banks</a> led to a sharp increase in the rate at which lenders borrow money, which will put a further squeeze on mortgage availability. </p> <p>The CML said \"exceptionally low\" turnover in the housing market - where transactions are running at around half last year's level - and<br>lower than anticipated remortgaging activity were likely to keep lending levels subdued for the immediate future.</p> <p>The CML's director general, Michael Coogan, said: \"These figures reflect the heightened uncertainty for both lenders and consumers in the mortgage market at present. </p> <p>\"Lenders are uncertain about future sources of funding and the cost of funding, while consumers are unsure about how much further and for how long house prices will continue to decline.\"</p> <p>Howard Archer, chief UK economist at Global Insight, said the week's events in the financial sector was set to cause further problems for the housing market. </p> <p>\"The current financial sector turmoil is likely to deepen the pressure on housing market activity, further tightening credit conditions and exerting upward pressure on interest rates,\" he said. <br> \"Given these very poor fundamentals for the housing market it is unlikely that the recently announced government measures to support the housing market will have a significant impact in stabilising activity or prices.\"</p> <p>Mortgage broker Andrew Montlake, a partner at Cobalt Capital, said the weak lending figures would come as no surprise to brokers who had seen the property market almost come to a standstill.<br> \"In some areas you could count the number of property transactions in August on one hand, so a further fall in gross lending was always on the cards. </p> <p>\"And although August is always a fairly quiet month, it could be a few months before things start to pick up given the events of the past few days.\" </p> <p>Montlake said he believed consumer confidence had never been so low, but added: \"Many of the professional property investors and landlords we deal with are snapping up properties at present, believing now to be the bottom of the market.\"</p>",
  "<p><em>I received this email from a person whose identity I know. He/she is a <strong>Daily Telegraph</strong> journalist, but I have a feeling it could have come from the newsroom of many titles, whether national or regional. I thought it deserved a wide audience because it says a great deal about the new culture within newspapers.</em></p> <p><em>I have amended it only very slightly in order to preserve the person's anonymity. I do not necessarily agree with the writer but I am certain that many of you will be nodding throughout. I will reply to it, hopefully tomorrow... </em><br> I was discussing with one of your colleagues an issue arising from, but not directly related to, events here at the Telegraph. It was about the likely future shape of a career in journalism. This is something I've seen touched on, but not directly discussed in your blog, and it's a subject about which I find myself increasingly pessimistic. I note that you've always said that society needs journalists, but it is looking increasingly unwilling to pay for them. I can see, from here, that national newspapers are beginning to head in the direction that local papers went 20 years ago, demanding levels of commitment - in hours and workload - that are unsustainable in conjunction with a normal family life. </p> <p>In return, they offer salaries too low to support a family, especially in London. Just as local journalists had to head for the nationals or get a job in PR by the time they reached their 30s, I fear that in the next five to 10 years it will be very hard for any grown-up to sustain a career in journalism at all, unless they have a private income or a particular sense of vocation or ambition. </p> <p>One of the (many) reasons why readers have deserted regional papers is that they feel that neither they, nor their communities, are properly reflected by the journalists who work for them. If national papers, already desperately London-centric, only want people who are prepared to work 70-hour weeks and don't care if they never see their kids, I can see them going the same way.<br> By the same token, as papers/websites etc use more and more content from citizen journalists/bloggers and others prepared to work for nothing, there is a danger that the only people with a voice will be those most desperate to be heard - and they are not usually the people you most want to listen to. The growth of blogs and online communities seems to be contributing plenty in the way of opinion, of which there's already plenty and not much in the way of facts. This is creating a brand of journalism in which it doesn't really matter if you get things wrong. </p> <p>Again, it's becoming all too clear at the Telegraph, whose online business plan seems to be centred on chasing hits through Google by rehashing and rewriting stories that people are already interested in. Facts are no longer the currency they used to be.<br> I don't have a particularly rosy view of the past and I am all too well aware that many of the things I've loved about papers, particularly the craft of putting them together, are becoming obsolete.</p> <p>But I do worry that without the professionalism of the career journalist, society will be much less well equipped to hold the powerful to account and that serious and intelligent debate will be lost under a global shouting match between anonymous partisan supporters of particular opinions or interests.<br> I hope this isn't too much of a rant, but I would love to hear your views on this subject, as an enthusiast for all things digital, if only to put my mind at rest. All the best</p> <p><em><strong>PS:</strong></em> Given the situation here at Telegraph Towers, I'd greatly appreciate it if you didn't use my name in anything you may publish. </p>",
  "<p>John Prescott today urged his party to unite behind Gordon Brown as he confirmed that he is setting up an organisation to campaign for a fourth term of Labour government.</p> <p>In an interview on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Prescott said that disunity could \"kill\" Labour and that, at a time of economic crisis, Brown was the man to lead the country through its difficulties.</p> <p>\"The public is listening to Labour - all it hears it talking about is leadership,\" he said.</p> <p>\"For God's sake, they are worried about their jobs, they are worried about the future. They want somebody who can handle global problems, and Gordon Brown is that man.\"</p> <p>Prescott went on: \"Disunity kills parties, whether it's Tories or Labour, and after 10 years it's amazing that we should be allowing a climate of opinion to undermine the kind of confidence in our party as to the role of a Labour government.</p> <p>\"I think if there's disunity, any party, all parties lose - the evidence is absolutely clear.\"</p> <p>Prescott disclosed his plan to set up a new campaigning organisation, Go Fourth \u2013 Campaign for a Labour Fourth Term, in <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/uk-politics/2008/09/labour-party-term-campaign\">an article in the New Statesman</a> jointly written with Alastair Campbell, Richard Caborn and Glenys Kinnock.</p> <p>In the piece, the authors say: \"If the polls and pundits are to be believed, within two years or so, David Cameron will be prime minister and the Conservatives back in power.</p> <p>\"People should cast their minds back to the mid-90s, when the Labour party under Neil Kinnock held commanding poll leads and won great byelection victories. The same lesson is there for both parties in the subsequent re-election of the Tories in 1992. For the Tories: not to assume that poll leads automatically translate to seats. For Labour: never to give up, never to bow down before fatalism or the self-serving hope of opponents in a self-fulfilling prophesy.</p> <p>\"The only real answer to the pollsters' question, 'If there were a general election tomorrow, how would you vote?' is: 'There isn't one.' A lot can happen between now and then.\"</p> <p>The authors argue that the Conservatives, who are offering no more than \"the style and froth Mr Cameron is very good at\", are not receiving enough critical scrutiny in the media.</p> <p>They say their campaign, which they will formally launch in six weeks' time, will have four aims:</p> <p>\u2022 To \"proudly\" defend Labour's record since 1997</p> <p>\u2022 To support the government in developing new policies</p> <p>\u2022 To encourage greater participation in the Labour party</p> <p>\u2022 To highlight the damage a Tory government could do.</p> <p>\"A fourth term, once unthinkable, remains a real prospect. More than that, it is vital to the future of Britain,\" they say.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/retail\">Retail sales</a> rose unexpectedly by 1.2% in August, official data showed today, leading several analysts to caution that the figures should be taken with a \"pinch of salt\".</p> <p>Analysts had been expecting a monthly fall of 0.5%. The overall monthly growth was driven by summer promotions and back-to-school shopping. Textile, clothing and footwear sales rose by 4.1% in the month to stand 8.8% higher than a year earlier.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics said sales on the high street increased by 3.3% in the year to August. </p> <p>Alan Clarke, an economist at BNP Paribas, said: \"UK retail sales apparently surged in August, far stronger than consensus estimates. Despite dreadful summer weather, clothing and footwear sales surged.</p> <p>\"The credibility of the retail sales numbers has been seriously undermined by recent volatility and today's number will add to the doubt. The MPC will continue to take more notice of survey indicators of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/highstreetretailers\">high street spending</a> than the ONS data. Surveys have been gloomy and appear more reasonable, while the official data appear rather questionable.\"</p> <p>Howard Archer, at the consultants Global Insight, said: \"Frankly these retail sales data are hard to believe and probably need to be taken with a huge pinch of salt. The data seem very much at odds with the survey evidence coming from both the British Retail Consortium and the CBI, as well as the news coming from most retailers.\"</p> <p>Sterling rose against the dollar on the back of the news. The pound rose to around $1.8248 from $1.8218.</p> <p>Separate data from the ONS released today showed that the UK's public sector net borrowing last month rose to \u00a310.4bn, the highest for a month of August since 1993.</p> <p>Jonathan Loynes, at Capital Economics, said: \"The \u00a310.4bn PSNB total in August brought the cumulative deficit in the first five months of the year up to \u00a328.2bn, compared to last year's \u00a316.5bn.

  "<p>Labour is looking into the abyss, frozen into immobility. The plotters gather. But the problem cannot be reduced to the leader, nor solved by changes in personalities. The New Labour project is exhausted. There are vague plans by Blairites to resurrect it. But this is not the 1990s: the New Labour brand is now toxic. In such endings lie new beginnings. We need policies to tackle the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/18/hbosbusiness.lloydstsbgroup5\">economic meltdown</a>, but most of all we need a politics. The status quo <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/18/economy.creditcrunch1\">is no solution</a>. We have to rediscover our idealism and our belief in our founding values \u2013 equality, justice, democracy, freedom. Socialism once gave us passion and hope and we need to draw on its intellectual resources and remake it for this new time and for new generations. </p> <p> The future does not belong to the <a href=\"http://www.lwbooks.co.uk/conservative.pdf\">Conservative party (pdf)</a>.The prospects for a more egalitarian social democracy are arguably better now than they were in 1997. Whoever wins the next election, there will be no re-run of the neoliberal economics of the 1980s and 90s. Three decades of economic restructuring have been brought to an end by recession. The frenzied period of financial speculation and profiteering is over. Neoliberalism has done its work and its creative destruction is now <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/16/labour.gordonbrown\">undermining</a> capitalism itself. It has become structurally unsustainable. </p> <p>Britain faces acute problems in creating a more equal and sustainable economy. Decades of wealth creation have ended up in the pockets of a few. Wage levels are stagnating or falling. Benefit levels continue to drop behind earnings, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/18/unemploymentdata.recession\">unemployment</a> is set to rise. Welfare reform will see an increasing number of the ill and disabled excluded from all forms of social support. The trend to inequality and poverty will intensify. In the longer term there is the impact of the global problems of food insecurity and water scarcity. The fear of impoverishment in old age, and the burdens of caring for aged relatives extends across the population. To compound these anxieties is the threat of climate change and peak oil. For the great majority of people, there are no individual, market solutions to these problems. </p> <p>The Conservatives, with their hostility toward the state, will not be able to defend society from market failure. Their idea of a \"<a href=\"http://www.centreforsocialjustice.org.uk/default.asp?pageRef=180\">welfare society</a>\" will only tinker with social deprivation while inequality and insecurity will run unchecked. The state is the only means society has for protecting itself from the destructive forces of global capitalism. It provides the only feasible agency for social insurance, integrating transport, managing energy and water security, tackling climate change, building a renewable technologies industry, developing a national strategy for agriculture production, and coordinating and redistributing resources to create a more equitable and sustainable economic development. </p> <p>But New Labour like the New Conservatives is trapped in the outdated liberal market politics of the 1990s. It wrongly believed that capitalism had eradicated class. In reality class has been restructured around new forms of production and consumption. Spurred on by focus groups, the latest poll ratings, and fear of a scabrous media, it has followed the path of least resistance. We have to tackle the structures of power and privilege that are damaging the economy and shaping all our destinies.</p> <p>Labour now has an historic opportunity to seize the political high ground. The era of selfish individualism is on the wane. The electorate is increasingly concerned with social insurance, safeguarding living standards and ensuring social stability and ecological sustainability. From <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/sep/16/travelnews.theairlineindustry\">stranded holidaymakers</a> to pension holders, to those falling ill, they are discovering that these collective goods are in dangerously short supply. The future will demand a more active and democratic state engaging with economic development and regulation. The redistribution of wealth and resources will be essential in rebalancing a dysfunctional economy. </p> <p>But such change will come about only by re-energising individual and collective political agency. The Labour party needs its own change. It has to democratise itself and turn outward, build alliances and connect with the creative energies that are everywhere in society but few and far between in mainstream politics. Labour needs to go back to the people, and it must re-establish its roots in the working class communities whose traditional cultures and sense of belonging have been destroyed. There are no quick fixes.

He's now a youthful 74, still with that gap-tooth trademark grin.</p> <p>But don't go away. The party was held to mark publication of \"Downing St Diary, Volume II. With James Callaghan in No 10.\" And \"Is the present crisis worse than the crisis of 1976, when the government had to get a loan from the IMF to tide it over?\" was a question on everyone's lips. </p> <p>It was the first \u2013 and only \u2013 such loan Britain has needed, touching bottom in its postwar decline as the global oil price shock and consequent inflation ripped through the system at up to 26%. </p> <p>Chancellor Healey later concluded the loan hadn't been necessary, though it was certainly a very sobering shock. Plenty of people alive then remembered Britain as a Great Power, as few now do.</p> <p>It goes without saying that most of last night's guests probably had senior citizens rail cards in their pockets, though tough old folk who haven't lost their marbles \u2013 yet \u2013 are often as sharp as they ever were. </p> <p>Clever Donoughue who had been an LSE economics lecturer and later head of some grand City research operations (plus jobs involving race courses and classical orchestras) is Labour through and through. </p> <p>So those present included ex-Labour types like the entire Gang of Three - Shirley Williams, David Owen and Bill Rodgers, their capo, Roy Jenkins no longer being on the party circuit \u2013 long since forgiven for their post-Callaghan defection.</p> <p>But there were no definite Tories that I spotted: I'm sure I must have missed some, as well as business types I don't know. Mostly it was older politicians and retired civil servants, academics like Anthony King, Peter Hennessy and David Butler, some media grandees like Peter Jay and Peter Stothard, plus inky-fingered coalface workers like Alan Watkins and myself.</p> <p>What can one fairly report on private conversations at an event like that? I don't think Bill Rodgers, once Callaghan's transport secretary, now an elder of the Lib Dem kirk, will mind me reporting that he'd backed the pro-public spending rebels at the party conference vote on tax in Bournemouth. </p> <p>\"I'm still a social democrat,\" Bill proudly explained. As for David Owen, he thinks a few Wall St bankers would make a good new chapter for his own latest book, Hubris, a doctor's take on political over-confidence from which (says me) he once suffered himself. No longer: medicine now interests him again more than politics. </p> <p>Donoughue, a Northampton secondary modern schoolboy who made good, touched upon the dilemma of discretion and good manners when reporting such exchanges in his brief remarks last night. Yes, he had kept a diary in No 10, but the morality of it troubled him. </p> <p>Thus he would talk with a No 10 official \u2013 last night he cheerily acknowledged one such at the back of the room - then scurry away and write it all down. He had tried to square the circle by waiting 30 years to publish; not that the old 30-year rule seemed to apply any more. People now seem to publish within 18 months, Bernard noted. </p> <p>I should insert at this point, as Donoughue did not, that by 1974 Richard Crossman had already burst that dam by publishing his 1964-70 cabinet diaries in the teeth of legal attempts to stop him. Hugo Young wrote a book about it. Tony Benn and Barbara Castle piled in behind Crossman, as have many since.</p> <p>As the less-than-snappy title suggests there is an old-fashioned air of propriety about Donoughue's tone which smacks of Callaghan himself. </p> <p>I haven't yet read the Diaries (Jonathan Cape \u00a330), but one earlier volume, The Heat of the Kitchen, gave a vivid and alarming picture of the later Wilson years. All good stuff if you like that sort of thing.</p> <p>In his introduction to the new volume, Donoughue describes Callaghan, who left school at 14, as dominating his cabinet as Wilson, the Oxford First, never did. </p> <p>Why? Huge experience for one thing. But Donoughue also reports that Callaghan had three layers: the bluff, avuncular Sunny Jim the public saw; below that \" a shrewd secretive and even wily politician\"; below that \"an authentic and very decent person who really did believe in the straight, honest values of life\".</p> <p>And Wilson? Just two layers, the top layer the \"clever, and devious political manipulator\"; below that \"a kindly, weak and insecure man\"; below that, where Callaghan retained the old-fashioned non-conformist values of his youth, \"perhaps just a void\". </p> <p>Food for contemporary thought there, I'd say, but will leave you to draw your own conclusions. I met Wilson and knew Callaghan slightly better. </p> <p>I can endorse his verdict. As between Blair and Brown there are bits of both men in both of them, though Callaghan's self-belief, less flashy than Blair's, is the key, I think. He was pretty solid and drew great strength from his family.</p> <p>So is the financial crisis of 2008 worse than 1976-79? And what should Labour do about its internal political crisis? </p> <p>Opinions were sharply divided on both. It's a lot worse now, said one expert witness. For all the air of political crisis in the 70s, for all the trade union militancy, few pay settlements exceeded the government's pay policy norm until Mrs T took over, and the real economy suffered little.</p> <p>I had a seat in the upper gallery, not the stalls, for that crisis and I'm not convinced that version is right. For another thing, the current world crisis involves everyone in varying degrees. </p> <p>So did the oil shocks, but we were worse placed to deal with them. Wage inflation rapidly became a problem. Are we worse placed now, over-dependent on financial services? Or is the economy flexible enough to recover more quickly? We shall see.</p> <p>As for Labour's crisis, some Labour grandees felt it would be quite insane to trigger a leadership contest in the present financial crisis, especially since there is no obvious successor to Brown. </p> <p>\"I simply don't recognise descriptions of Tuesday's cabinet meeting which I read in the press,\" said one well-placed figure who detects no appetite for revolt around the cabinet table and wonders who is doing the briefing.</p> <p>Other old sweats were scornful of the present government's performance (\"I care about the Labour party, not about Gordon Brown\") and feel that blood on the carpet is inevitable, so get it over with. </p> <p>How about David Miliband with Jon Cruddas as his deputy? was one suggestion, the Straws and Ballses dismissed out of hand. And you'd need new policies as well as new faces, my friend added.</p> <p>That pair might well be the best Labour could hope for, though these things are hard to arrange (\"Harriet would win,\" I was assured mid-week) and I share John Prescott's view that the public looks for leadership, not a new leader. </p> <p>These are becoming scary times. On the radio today even the BBC's Robert Peston was sounding suitably sombre at last. Not a single burst of inappropriate laughter.</p> <p>It is a defining moment we have been keenly awaiting, like Kate Adie turning up in a war zone. That bad, eh?</p>",
  "<p>Some feminists lament the glossy rise of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin</a>, others rush with sisterly ostentation to <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122143727571134335.html\">defend her from sexism</a> even as they repudiate her politics. While plenty of typeface has been expended on analysing her obvious and <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jOTk11gvqDAgD0cY3i4WjI_2YOxwD93814FO0\">myriad failings</a> as a serious politician, what mainstream feminism and the US women's movement have yet to do is to own her or, rather, to own up to her. </p> <p>A certain brand of corporate feminism, one that has long dominated the public sphere in the western world, now finds itself trapped in the jaws of a self-proclaimed <a href=\"http://www.zazzle.com/sarah_palin_and_a_pit_bull_shirt-235176829805295136\">pitbull</a>. For while the woman who has galvanised the American right and who champions its most retrograde values may be a feminist nightmare, she was also conjured up by the monochrome dreams of its most prominent strands. Sarah Palin, hockey mom and career woman, is the disastrous product of single-issue feminism.</p> <p>There's little pleasure to be had from saying this, and yet facing up to this unpleasant truth is essential if the debate on gender and politics is to ever move beyond the impasse in which it finds itself. Sarah Palin is less an anti-feminist disaster than a triumph of corporate feminism in the US and elsewhere. With its emphasis on power and privilege, this feminism, rather than questioning the world we live in, has insisted on participating fully in almost every one of its hierarchies. It has sought to sup at the table rather than change the menu and ensure that everyone is fed. </p> <p>In its worldview, \"women\" are a generic category and the clear winners of an oppression sweepstake for which amends must be made to already privileged women at the expense of everything else. It's a position exemplified by <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/08/opinion/08steinem.html\">Gloria Steinem</a>'s support for Hillary on the basis that \"gender is probably the most restricting force in American life today\". Gender has indeed been a greatly restrictive category and nowhere more so than within this brand of feminism. With its narrow emphasis on biological womanhood to the exclusion of other factors, this feminism has persistently refused to recognise the ways in which gender necessarily intersects with other forces like ethnicity, race, class and sexuality to produce a range of different positions from which women relate to the world.</p> <p>As such, Sarah Palin is less a scourge than a lesson. She \u2013 and her rapidly growing support base \u2013 has finally laid bare the category \"woman\" as deployed by the media and prominent American feminists: all along it has actually meant \"white woman\". (The same voices that so loudly defend Palin against sexism were not so voluble when Michelle Obama was subjected to far more vicious pillorying on the basis of her race and gender.) Palin's rise has also made clear that, while it is perfectly acceptable on right and left to stress gender and gender equality, talking about race is still verboten. </p> <p>Any discussion of race or racism must be suppressed, as it has been by Obama, for fear of being seen as \"grievance\". Gender, however, can be trotted out as evidence of both restriction and accomplishment. As was evident during the Hillary-Obama contest, race and gender are also falsely defined as entirely separate in their operation. Do we really think that the now legendary <a href=\"http://ac360.blogs.cnn.com/2008/08/06/18-million-cracks-in-the-presidential-glass-ceiling/\">18 million cracks in the glass ceiling</a> credited to Hillary will work in favour of all women, regardless of race and class? Is it cynical or realistic to think that it's going to take a lot more work for both the white single \"welfare mom\" from Kansas and the married black grandmother from Virginia to break through it?</p> <p>Palin's paltry knowledge of the world beyond her own is no exception. It is a weakness she shares with the mainstream women's movement in the US. While Anglo-American feminism has tended to see women in Asia and Latin America as requiring emancipation to its own exalted standards, even a basic awareness of women's movements in other parts of the world would reveal that the most powerful kinds of women's activism have never been about gender alone. </p> <p>From landlessness, resources, reproductive rights and the environment to wages, war and imperialism, women's movements in places such as Chile, Indonesia, Nigeria, India and Venezuela have had to develop a complex understanding of the issues (in the plural) at stake. When economic justice, peace, the environment, health and reproductive rights are all seen as equally integral to the wellbeing of women and their fellow human beings, there is no question of women defending a retrograde and dangerous politician merely because she also happens to be biologically female. </p> <p>To be feminist is not simply to want to be a woman with power, but to be transformed by the most urgent issues of our time. Until that lesson is absorbed by women's movements in the US and elsewhere, our backs will be bridges for the Palins of the world - even as their spiked heels grind contemptuously into our spines.</p>",

Morgan Stanley is said to be in merger talks with US regional banking group Wachovia, but other names mentioned as possible saviours for the US investment bank - HSBC and China's Citic - seem to be ruling themselves out. <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/hsbcholdings\">HSBC</a></strong> is up 5.25p to 806.25p.</p> <p>After falling to 4883.3, the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> is now 49.1 points higher at 4961.5.

Or the markets, who have searched out weakness wherever they can?</p> <p>\"Morgan Stanley is now in the sights of the pack, as anything even remotely weakened by current events seems fair game for the predators. The problem is that as soon as the whispers and rumours begin, the afflicted bank finds it impossible to rollover inter-bank loans, as counterparties insist on repayment. Any normal bank will have billions of dollars/pounds requiring rollover each and every day, and not only this, but many longer term loans can have early redemption if requested by the lender. </p> <p>\"Money desks quickly become swamped with withdrawal requests and are unable to replace the hole in the finances quickly enough to 'flatten' their books. Even banks must have matched books at the end of each and every business day. For every pound out in loans they must have a pound of deposit.

  "<p>Now Wall Street has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/wallstreet\">made it official</a>: the boom is finally over and the world economy is not going to be quite the same for a while. But before we think of how to deal with the current mess, we need to figure out what that boom actually meant for most people in the world.</p> <p>Everyone now knows it was unsustainable, a flimsy house of cards that greedy and irresponsible financial institutions could build because deregulation allowed dodgy practices. The economic boom drew rapaciously and fecklessly on natural resources. It was also deeply unequal. Contrary to general perception, most people in the developing world did not gain from that boom. </p> <p>The bubble in the US attracted savings from across the world, including from the poorest developing countries, so that for at least five years the south transferred financial resources to the north. Governments of developing countries opened up their markets to trade and finance, gave up on monetary policy and pursued fiscally \"correct\" policies that reduced public spending. So development projects remained incomplete and citizens were deprived of the most essential socio-economic rights. </p> <p>Nor was there a net transfer of jobs from north to south. In fact, industrial employment in the south barely increased in the past decade \u2013 even in China, the \"factory of the world\". Instead, technological change in manufacturing and the new services meant that fewer workers could generate more output. So old jobs in the south were lost or became precarious and the majority of new jobs were fragile, insecure and low-paying, even in China and India. The agrarian crisis in the developing world hurt peasant livelihood and generated global food problems. Rising inequality meant that the much-hyped growth in emerging markets did not benefit most people. </p> <p>Of course, crises tend to make things worse, not better. As economies slow down, more jobs will be lost and people, especially those in the developing world who did not really gain from the boom, will face deteriorating conditions of living.</p> <p>But the gloom and doom is not inevitable. Now that there is overwhelming evidence of the failure of the economic model on which the boom was based, we can think afresh about how to organise economic life, both nationally and globally. </p> <p>Such new thinking has got to take into account the changed international context, in which the overwhelming dominance of the US is likely to be replaced by inter-imperialist rivalry and scramble for resources and markets, in which it will be harder for any individual country (or even the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G8\">G8</a>) to impose conditions on others. Three points must be noted if we want real democratic change and not just more of the same.</p> <p>First, finance must be controlled and the \"innovations\" in financial markets that are actually no more than sleight-of-hand scams must be disallowed. Otherwise we will remain vulnerable to more financial crises and continue to face speculative swings in prices of important commodities like food and oil. And poor countries will continue to send to rich ones the capital they desperately need for their own development. </p> <p>Second, fiscal policy and public expenditure must be brought back to centre stage. Across the world, we need significantly increased public expenditure to revive demand in flagging economies, to manage the effects of climate change and bring in widespread use of green technologies, to fulfil the promise of achieving minimally acceptable standards of living for everyone in the developing world. </p> <p>Third, restructuring the world order will have to be based on conscious attempts to reduce income and wealth inequalities, both between countries and within countries. We have clearly crossed the limits of what is \"acceptable\" inequality. The effects are upon us every day: in growing socio-political conflicts; in the spread of enthusiasm for terrorism and violence among the dispossessed and the frustrated; in the growing insecurity of daily life anywhere. </p> <p>Reducing inequalities is not going to be easy. It will require the north to reduce its consumption of scarce resources and carbon emissions, which means some reduction of average consumption generally. It will require the global elite, spread across both developed and developing worlds, to curb extravagant lifestyles. It will require wage shares of national income to rise from their current very low proportions, with corresponding declines in the shares of profits and interest. And it will require governments in the powerful developed countries to recognise that they can no longer call the shots in all important international decisions. </p> <p>This may seem like an impossible wish list, but it may be essential. When an economic order has so clearly outlived its usefulness and is collapsing, it makes sense to build a new one on different principles. </p> <p><em>Professor Ghosh is speaking at a Guardian/New Economics Foundation debate on Friday in London.

  "<p>Ah Washington! It's one of the few cities in the United States where walking down the street you can overhear a kid probably still a decade away from voting age ask his mother, \"Who's going to win the election?\" The mother responded wearily, \"I don't know.\" For a lot of voters, election fatigue or indifference is setting in during the closing stretch of what amounts to a two-year campaign. </p> <p>Apart from being obsessed with politics, Washington is also one of those cities where people from all across the country pass through either as tourists or on business.

He was pouring over the Wall Street Journal. Its front page was covered with towering headlines about the bailout of AIG. She and I talked about the election. She said that the economy was a big issue, but despite <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5isOFwdbq0tsqatW6vJpkDRTI1gMgD938LG500\">Barack Obama's best efforts to focus his message on the economy</a>, she still didn't have any sense of where he stood on the issue. </p> <p>That's not to say that either candidate is winning what analysts are calling a 'jump ball' issue. (Subtitled American for our international readers: a toss up, referring to basketball when the referee tosses the ball up and a player from each team tries to tip the ball to a member of his or her team.) <a href=\"http://blog.indecision2008.com/2008/09/17/the-daily-show-the-candidates-hold-a-generic-off-on-the-financial-crisis/\">Daily Show host Jon Stewart called it a 'generic-off'</a>. </p> <blockquote> <p>The solutions to the Wall Street troubles are complicated and may turn away voters, so the candidates have no choice but to provide generic answers. ...

It was a fascinating conversation. I asked them if the economy was an issue for them. This isn't just about Wall Street bankers losing their jobs. They said that \"a lot of people were hurting\". I asked them if people were focused on issues like the <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/items/200809140003\">economy or distracted by BS like lipstick-gate</a>. They said that only the people who had the luxury to get outraged about such things were distracted from the economic crisis. </p> <p>They both seemed unimpressed by either candidate. He said that both parties were engaged in \"buffoonery\". She said: \"Is this really our choice? Don't we get a third? One seems too young and inexperienced, and the other seems too old.\"</p> <p>They also said that life-long Republicans they knew had been demoralised, that is until John McCain picked Sarah Palin as his running mate. \"Everyone was watching her speech because no one knew who she was, and they all said she gave a dinger of a speech,\" he said. </p> <p>I'm wondering if this is election fatigue or a sense that neither candidate seems prepared to deal with the economic crisis. How is the economic crisis playing out where you live? Which candidate has offered up the plan that makes the most sense to you? </p> <p>John McCain has promised a 9/11 commission style investigation into the causes of the financial crisis. Barack Obama has called for tax-breaks for the middle class, tightening up on predatory lenders and an investigation into conflicts of interest at ratings agency. Some are calling for the <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/obama-says-mccain-just-doesnt/story.aspx?guid=%7BAA1A280D-3AC9-4A88-B049-55A1F0BEB981%7D&amp;dist=msr_1\">creation of an agency like the Resolution Trust Corporation</a> that helped pull the US out of the Savings and Loan crisis of the 1980s. </p> <p>Are you worried about your local bank? According to the Washington Post:</p> <blockquote> <p>As the financial crisis worsens, many consumers have been asking what would happen if their bank fails. The FDIC, an independent government agency, has 117 banks on its list of troubled institutions. That is up from 90 in the first quarter of this year.</p> </blockquote> <p>It's getting really ugly. Maybe this shock to the global financial system will be like cold water in the face of voters, shaking them out of their election fatigue. We'll see. It's definitely one of the things that I hope to find out during the trip.</p> <p>UPDATE: I've had this comment via Facebook from Philip Lim Chin Guan in Malaysia:</p> <blockquote> <p>Most of us have a plan, even if we are not politicians but the real test is when you are at ground zero.</p> <p>Anybody can stand up on a soapbox and proclaim to the world that he has a 10-point plan to take care of business or the lack of it.</p> <p>But when you are in the Oval Office or at the operations Hq, then you will start feeling the heat, and when the sparks start flying, whether or not you have got what it takes will start to show.</p> <p>In all my 32 years of professional life, everything boils down to one thing: can you think straight when everything starts collapsing around you?</p> <p>That's when the whole world will know whether you got a Plan!!</p> </blockquote> <p>If you'd like to follow the trip on Facebook, I'm the Kevin Anderson in the black Pork Pie hat.
