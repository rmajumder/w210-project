  "<p>I've been hearing it all over the place: Yes, Barack Obama is up in the polls, but <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Vote2008/story?id=6031233\">will his lead hold</a>? Even though national polls have widened slightly in the final days of the campaign, concerns about the reliability of the polls in predicting the election of our first African-American president won't go away.<br> According to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_effect\">Bradley effect</a> (also known as the Wilder effect), white Americans will exaggerate their willingness to vote for a black when asked by pollsters. The theory is that some whites think that voicing support for the black candidate is more socially acceptable. (Tom Bradley was a former mayor of Los Angeles who narrowly lost the elections for governor of California in 1982 after being ahead in the polls. Doug Wilder was elected governor of Virginia in 1989, though by a narrower margin than predicted.)<br> The concern for Obama supporters is that if the actual vote falls two or three percentage points below some polls, then John McCain could still eke out a victory.</p> <p>But the most thorough analysis of the phenomenon finds that the Bradley effect disappeared more than a decade ago. Daniel Hopkins of Harvard <a href=\"http://people.iq.harvard.edu/%7Edhopkins/wilder13.pdf\">pulled together the data from 133 state-wide elections held between 1989 and 2006</a> (pdf). He found that before 1996 blacks \"performed on average 2.7 percentage points worse than their polling numbers would indicate.\"<br> Since then, however, racially charged issues like welfare and crime have become less important to voters, according to Hopkins: \"In 1995, 12% of Americans cited social welfare issues as the nation's most important problem, a figure that was just 5% by 2001 and 4% in 2004. In 1994, 29% of Americans cited crime as the nation's most important problem, a figure that had dropped to 9% by 2004.\" If so Bill Clinton and Joe Biden may have set the stage for Obama with the passage of welfare reform and crime bills in the 1990s. Biden's 1994 crime bill, which provided funding for 100,000 police in state and local jurisdictions, helped reduce national crime rates and took away the argument that Democrats were soft on crime. \"Law and order\" stopped being a political catch phrase and became instead the name of television's most successful cop show franchise.  The next year, Clinton joined with Republicans in Congress to reform welfare, placing time limits on benefits and requiring that recipients return to work within two years. Gone are the days when Republicans like Ronald Reagan could campaign on welfare queens living off the taxes of hard-working whites. Another reason the Bradley effect has disappeared is that whites are more familiar, and thus more comfortable, with blacks representing them in office. According to the Joint Centre for Political and Economic Studies, blacks are finding increasing success with all voters, not just urban minorities. By 2007, <a href=\"http://www.jointcenter.org/index.php/current_research_and_policy_activities/political_participation/black_elected_officials_roster_introduction_and_overview\">30% of black state legislators</a> served districts with mostly white residents.<br> Obama and his campaign managers <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5h9_GcRuwpbtaVtNPEL7fLTETiMpgD944F0R00\">understand</a> that familiarity breeds consent. The campaign has opened field offices in small towns in states like Virginia, North Carolina and even Arizona. Obama has paid an astonishing <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122549472220189573.html\">48 visits to Indiana</a>, compared to McCain's two stops, which is why that red state is now in play. Political observers who thought Obama was just throwing a head fake by competing in so many red states are now seeing the Democratic candidate threatening to win these states for the first time in a generation.<br> In recent weeks, Republicans have latched on the tax issue, arguing that Obama wants to spread the wealth - as in tax you and give it someone less deserving. While this line may have caught on with Joe the Plumber and his buddies, the political environment is not as conducive to such arguments as it once was. McCain and his allies are furiously trying to paint Obama as too scary to serve as president. But Americans are increasingly comfortable with black candidates in general, and Obama in particular. With polls showing him above 50% for the last several weeks, I don't think voters are going to show a last-minute change of heart when they step in the polling booth.</p>",
  "<p>Last month, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, the Argentine president, announced the presentation in Congress of a bill to <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7682877.stm\">nationalise private pension funds</a>. The move fuelled fears in global financial markets that Argentina may default on its debt payments, just like it did in 2001.</p> <p>The ensuing arguments in Argentina have, however, focused on two very different aspects: critics of the move decry a greedy and corrupt government eager to put its hands on fresh cash, while the government portrays the move as ideological and aimed at protecting future pensioners and improving social security from the volatility of the financial markets where the funds are invested. Debt payments are hardly mentioned.</p> <p>The 10 privately-owned pension funds \u2013 or AFPJs as they are called in Argentina \u2013 have generated their share of negative publicity for themselves over the years with their low returns and exorbitant commissions. Since their creation in 1994, the funds have saved 96,000 million pesos for retirement accounts while pocketing 36,000 million in administration fees. The ratio of pension contributions to pensions paid also highly favours the funds, which currently have some 3 million contributors but only pay pensions to around 450,000 people. </p> <p>Created in 1994 by the conservative Peronist president Carlos Menem, the private pensions scheme has been widely criticised. Because of this, Kirchner's bill has split the opposition. While the centre-right is infuriated \u2013 in an editorial, the conservative daily La Naci\u00f3n called the move \"<a href=\"http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1061925\">legalised robbery</a>\" \u2013 the centre-left is happy with the bill's core idea (they take issue with the wording but are more than willing to negotiate).</p> <p>This is not the first change to the original scheme. Last year, N\u00e9stor Kirchner, Cristina's husband and predecessor, modified it to allow workers to freely move between the private scheme and the state (previously, this could only be done once, at the start of a person's working life). The overhanging question is why has Cristina Kirchner decided to change a system her husband had already modified.</p> <p>The president has been in office for less than a year and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/30/argentina-kirchner\">has not done well</a>. She has been battered on many fronts, most notably by growing inflation and a months-long battle with farmers over export tariffs that ended in July when the Senate rejected a government-sponsored bill to tax exports of soy and other grains. The congressional defeat was especially painful because it was inflicted not only by the centre-right parties but also by members of the centre-left opposition who are ideologically close to the administration \u2013 like the Socialist and Radical parties \u2013 and, more painfully, by members of Kirchner's own Peronist party.</p> <p>This new bill puts those rebel Peronists and the Socialists and Radicals in an odd position. The rebel Peronists can hardly oppose the proposal because they are part of a self-named \"workers' party\" and the pension scheme change is widely perceived as a win-win situation for workers (the two leading union umbrellas have celebrated the move). Socialists and Radicals have been critical of the private pensions for years and therefore cannot oppose change either. </p> <p>Therefore, the pension bill can also be considered an attempt to win a large-scale political victory that would serve as political redemption for the government and redefine the line between progressive and rightist political camps.</p> <p>Problems surface among supporters of nationalisation when it comes to writing the bill itself, since the government version is extremely ambiguous. Critics, even those who support nationalising the funds like <a href=\"http://artepolitica.com/volver-a-reparto-es-respetar-la-constitucion/\">the opposition lawmaker Mar\u00eda Am\u00e9rica Gonz\u00e1lez</a>, have serious doubts about how pensions funds will be managed and regulated once they fall into government hands. Given the history of political patronage by Argentine governments, many say the funds will be used next year to win votes in the midterm elections.</p> <p>The government says that under state management, pension funds would never be invested in \"intangible\" markets as they are today and would only be used for social security or investments in infrastructure in Argentina (after the bill was presented, the government <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b16ee040-a558-11dd-b4f5-000077b07658.html?nclick_check=1\">ordered AFPJs to repatriate assets invested abroad</a>). To ensure this, several members of the opposition have suggested controls and regulations for the money, such as limiting the use of the funds to social security.</p> <p>With these arguments going on, there is little space for talk of possible debt defaults, mainly because debt payments are due in the second half of 2009, light years away in Argentine political terms. Fiscal gaps are growing, and the government may need reserves to control the exchange rate, but had the administration really been concerned about obtaining cash to control a problematic market, it had other ways to do so. Currently, around 55% of all pension fund assets are Argentine government bonds, which proves that when the government wanted to get funding from AFPJs it knew how to. It could have done the same this time, and it could have also made AFPJs repatriate funds without nationalising them. Instead, it decided to make a political gambit whose results are yet to be seen.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/privateequity\">private equity</a> firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, which controls scores of global businesses including Boots the Chemist, has delayed plans to go public because of the \"extraordinary turbulence\" in global markets.</p> <p>KKR said its public offering, which had been expected to raise up to $15bn (\u00a39.5bn), will not go ahead until 2009, although it stressed it remained committed to the move.</p> <p>The US firm is due to access the markets through a complex deal involving a merger with an offshoot, KKR Private Equity Investors, which is already listed on Amsterdam's Euronext stockmarket.</p> <p>It has become clear this Dutch-listed venture is suffering the effects of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketturmoil\">global economic turmoil</a>. It reported yesterday the value of its assets had slumped by $649m, including a $44m fall in its stake in Boots, blamed on the decline of sterling against the dollar.</p> <p>One of the biggest private equity firms in the world, KKR is run by billionaires Henry Kravis and George Roberts, who founded the business in 1976.</p> <p>In a statement, Roberts said: \"Some of our investments faced reduced valuations during the third quarter as a result of the extraordinary turbulence in the global capital markets.\"</p> <p>Among the assets losing value were investments in computer firm Sun Microsystems, market research firm Nielsen and Capmark, a financial services group with exposure to US mortgages.</p> <p>The company insisted the reduced valuation for the Boots investment was triggered entirely by the pound weakening against the dollar. </p> <p>KKR partner Paul Raether told investors on a conference call: \"Our investment in Alliance Boots is performing well and validating our initial investment thesis for the business, which was to own a market leader in a defensive industry with significant potential for revenue enhancement and cost savings.\" He added that sales and top-line operating profit for Boots were \"above budget\".</p> <p>Nevertheless, many investors remain concerned about high levels of debt and shrinking consumer spending. In common with many private equity-backed firms, Alliance Boots' debt continues to trade at a discount to its face value. </p> <p>KKR's Euronext-listed arm said sources of liquidity \"may not only be more difficult, but also impossible to obtain\" in the current market. But it said KKR's plans to go public were still a firm commitment: \"The parties remain committed to completing the transaction, but do not at this point expect the transaction to close until 2009.\"</p> <p>The delay is the latest in a string of hold-ups. The company initially filed regulatory documents in June 2007 for a flotation, shortly after rival Blackstone's public offering. </p> <p>The company, whose ruthless approach was immortalised in the book \"Barbarians at the Gate\", sees the public markets as a source of evergreen capital and as an eventual way for its founders to draw down the value of their stakes.</p>",
  "<p>A terminally dull weekend at the North American box office that to be fair was hijacked by the second most commercial holiday in the US calendar \u2013 you have to see Halloween here to believe it \u2013 saw Disney's tween dream <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/126069/high.school.musical.3\">High School Musical 3: Senior Year</a> hold on to the No 1 spot for the second consecutive weekend.</p> <p>Zac Efron and his shiny happy cohorts chalked up a further $15m (\u00a39.48m) according to studio estimates and boosted the movie's running total to $61.8m (\u00a339m). This prized asset from the Disney empire's highly lucrative Disney Channel may have the legs to propel itself past the talismanic $100m mark, although $90m would seem a safer bet as it winds down in the coming weeks.</p> <p>Regardless of where it ends, Disney chiefs will be pleased with what its theatrical releasing division Buena Vista has accomplished here, teeing the movie up perfectly for substantially richer revenues on DVD and TV. Significantly, the movie is going great guns outside the US where it has amassed more than $85m from 32 territories in 10 days, the UK alone accounting for $28.5m. Global box office matters more than ever to studios' greenlight committees and it can only be a matter of time before chaperones across the world steel themselves for a fourth instalment.</p> <p>Kevin Smith movies don't typically make a bundle of cash, but the goateed cult film-maker could be on to something with his latest effort, the engaging comedy <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/126330/zack.and.miri.make.a.porno\">Zack and Miri Make a Porno</a>, released through the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/harvey-weinstein\">Weinstein</a> Company. Like everything else this weekend, Zack and Miri took a heavy blow from Halloween on Friday night but bounced back on Saturday and Sunday to finish in second place on $10.7m.</p> <p>Hot comedy star Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks, a rising actor who earned solid reviews for her portrayal of Laura Bush in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/126059/w\">W</a>, play best friends who shoot a skin flick to make ends meet. The Weinsteins' distribution chief Steve Bunnell said the use of the word \"Porno\" in the R-rated movie's title may have confused certain moviegoers, some of whom chose to stay away. Puritanical America is discerning when it comes to porn and prefers torture porn, which is why <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/126713/saw.v\">Saw V</a> helped Saw become the most successful horror franchise last weekend. The Weinsteins now hope that positive word of mouth will get more audiences to see Zack and Miri throughout November; if that happens it stands a chance of passing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/77523/dogma\">Dogma</a>'s $30.7m final gross set in early 2000.</p> <p>Lionsgate's Saw V, meanwhile, dropped one place to No 3 in its second weekend and grossed $10.1m to elevate its tally to as respectable $45.8m. Arguably the most impressive performer in the top 10 was Universal Pictures' period mystery <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/124297/changeling\">Changeling</a>, which stars an enraged but strangely unengaging Angelina Jolie as a wronged mother who is flung this way and that by a Los Angeles Police Department<br>desperate to claw back the public's trust. Changeling climbed 16 places to No 4 on $9.4m after expanding into a wide release pattern following last weekend's limited launch.</p> <p>The movie is directed by Clint Eastwood and represents the first strike in this remarkable film-maker's awards season one-two punch (Gran Torino follows on December 17). Putting the film out in a small number of cinemas and extending the reach in successive weekends is the accepted way of handling the Eastwood oeuvre these days, the idea being that astute arthouse audiences will get all frothy about what they'be ve seen and whet the appetite of a wider demographic. It appears to have worked and the movie, now on $10.1m, looks like it might stick around.</p> <p>In a Halloween top 10 surprisingly light on thrills and chills, the teen supernatural tale <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/oct/28/horror\">The Haunting of Molly Hartley</a> featuring a low-key cast opened in fifth place on a whisker over $6m through the service distributor Freestyle Releasing. Freestyle, co-founded by the British former film sales executive Susan Jackson, is unlike studio distributors in that it agrees to handle the administration that goes with distributing a movie for a flat fee and takes a limited share in the gross receipts, far less than a studio. The upside for a company like Freestyle is it doesn't pay the cost of cutting prints and paying for the advertising campaign, which on a wide release like this would run into many, many millions of dollars. Jackson asks the<br>producers to do that.</p> <p>The bottom half of the chart is a story of decline as the successful <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/126327/beverly.hills.chihuahua\">Beverly Hills Chihuahua</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/126065/eagle.eye\">Eagle Eye</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/126616/secret.life.of.bees\">The Secret Life of Bees</a> and the not so successful <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/126712/max.payne\">Max Payne</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/126201/pride.and.glory\">Pride and Glory</a> begin their inexorable<br>slide into obscurity after several weeks of action.

With all respect to Ritchie and Gerard Butler, however, there's only one Brit US audiences are anxious to get their eyes on and after this weekend's stunning $25.3m record launch in the UK, all eyes will be on Daniel Craig when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/122628/quantum.of.solace\">Quantum of Solace</a> arrives in the US on November 14.</p>",
  "<p>Attempts by Gordon Brown to enlist banks in softening conditions for families and businesses suffered a setback yesterday when one of the country's most senior bankers travelling on the prime minister's own trip said his company was unlikely to pass on to customers the full effects of future interest rate cuts.<br> David Hodgkinson, chief operating officer at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/hsbcholdings\">HSBC</a> and one of 27 business leaders on the four-stop tour of the Gulf, said yesterday that even if the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor\">Bank of England's monetary policy committee</a> (MPC) was to reduce interest rates on Thursday, the effect would not be \"linear\".<br> Brown will be infuriated with both the content and timing of Hodgkinson's comments since the banker's interview broke moments before the prime minister delivered the key note speech of his four-day trip to the Gulf. Addressing a conference in Abu Dhabi, Brown laid out his five-point plan for the G20 meeting in Washington. He also restated the expectations the government now had of banks after it intervened to save three of the UK's biggest with \u00a337bn of public money. Brown said: \"Having helped to strengthen the global banking system through recapitalisation, governments must ensure that the money is used to enable a resumption of lending to families and businesses.\" HSBC is Europe's largest bank and has 3% of the 11m mortgages sold in the UK. Hodgkinson's remarks represent the first time a senior businessman has so clearly articulated the thinking of the banking sector. In an interview Hodgkinson said: \"As an adjustment process that is taking place, clearly if interest rates are down significantly the rates for borrowing will go down but I am not going to say it is absolutely linear, because it depends on the particular [situation] and the risk.\" He said he expected there to be some \"stickiness\" should the Bank of England's monetary policy committee cut rates. However, the activity of banks in the past month indicates many may share Hodgkinson's thinking. Though the MPC carried out an emergency rate cut of half a percentage point last month, only half of banks have cut their standard variable rates. The website moneyfacts.co.uk also revealed that 82% of lenders had not passed on the full 1% cut from the past three base rate cuts and 57% of lenders passed on just half or less of the last three base rate cuts. The businessman was immediately slapped down by the prime minister's official spokesman who said that should official rates be cut, consumers could expect to see full benefits. A government spokesman said: \"The prime minister is very clear that we are taking the action to ensure that more mortgage holders and small businesses feel the benefit.\" The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/regulators\">Financial Services Authority</a> recently said repossession rates had risen by 71% as householders struggled to meet rising bills. In the April to June quarter, repossessions had risen to over 11,000 from about 6,500 in April. In September mortgage lending fell 10% to its lowest level in more than three years, thought in part to be down to the difficulties first-time buyers were having in obtaining finance.<br> Last week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/30/interest-rates-us-economy\">the US federal reserve cut rates by half a percentage point</a> and it was expected that the MPC would make a half percentage point cut this week, with some holding out for a full 1% cut. Interest rates in the UK currently stand at 4.5%.<br> Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Vince Cable said it was difficult to see the justification for not passing on the full benefit of any cut. </p> <p>\"Banks are only too happy to increase the cost of lending when interest rates go up,\" he said. \"For customers to get a fair deal, this needs to be a two-way street.<br> \"When the whole banking industry owes so much to taxpayers for their very survival, any bank will find itself on very thin ice if it is found to be unfairly profiteering from its customers. \"As the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\"> credit crunch</a> continues to keep millions of customers and small businesses in a stranglehold, borrowers need interest rate cuts now.\"<br> In a speech to the Saudi chamber of commerce Brown praised the delegation of businessmen on his trip, saying their collected wealth was $400bn and calling them the \"highest profile trade delegation\".</p>",
  "<p>The billionaire property developer, Donald Trump, today won permission to build \"the world's greatest golf course\", complete with high-rise timeshare flats and eight storey hotel, on a rare and ecologically sensitive stretch of dunes overlooking the North Sea.</p> <p>The New York-based businessman said he was \"greatly honoured\" after Scottish ministers in Edinburgh confirmed that his dream of creating one of golf's most northerly resorts had been approved, despite vociferous opposition from environmentalists and many local residents.</p> <p>And his most famous opponent, Michael Forbes, the fisherman and quarry worker who earned abuse from Trump last year after refusing repeatedly to sell his home at the centre of the resort, still has no intention of moving out.</p> <p>\"He has no hope in hell of getting us away,\" said his wife, Sheila Forbes. \"We're staying put, and that's it.\"</p> <p>The \u00a31bn resort, north of Aberdeen, will feature two 18-hole championship courses, four blocks of 950 timeshare flats, 500 private homes, 36 villas, a golf academy, housing for 400 staff connected by a coast road officially named \"Trump Boulevard\".</p> <p>Today's outline planning approval, however, legally binds Trump to agree to a series of environmental checks and controls, giving Aberdeenshire council and the Scottish government's environment agency, Scottish Natural Heritage, legal oversight to ensure remaining plant species and wildlife are fully protected.</p> <p>Trump will also be required to build a 225-pupil primary school, shops, 98 low-cost houses and 50 starter homes - on land provided free by the council - in return for the private 500-home estate, chalets and the timeshares, which will fund the entire development.</p> <p>The widely-anticipated decision was welcomed by the local constituency MSP, first minister and leader of the Scottish National party, Alex Salmond, and by numerous business and tourism groups as a major boost to the regional economy.</p> <p>Salmond, whose party faces a crucial byelection on Thursday in Glenrothes, Fife, insisted he had not influenced the decision. \"In tough economic times, substantial investment of this kind is at a premium. Six thousand jobs, including 1,400 which will be local and permanent, is a powerful argument,\" he said.</p> <p>\"This proposal would never have been made if it were not for the outstanding natural beauty of the area. It is entirely right and proper that the resources of the country are harnessed to boost one of our great industries, and tourism is a great Scottish industry.\"</p> <p>Trump added: \"It will be a tremendous asset and source of pride for both Aberdeenshire and Scotland for many generations. As I have often said, because of the quality of the land we are given to work with, we will build the greatest golf course in the world.\"</p> <p>Conservationists were furious since ministers had agreed to override legal protection for part of the Foveran links, a system of naturally shifting sand dunes, which are designated a site of special scientific interest under EU habitats legislation, but are central to Trump's vision.</p> <p>The so-called \"back nine\" holes of the main 18-hole course will be built over about a tenth of the dunes despite protests from Trump's own ecologists and SNH that this was unnecessarily destructive.</p> <p>Trump had refused to move that section of the course, again overruling his own environmental experts, telling the planning inquiry in June that he didn't do \"half-assed\". It was, he told the inspectors, all or nothing. It was the \"magnificence of the dunes, the valleys of the dunes, the access to the ocean, the views of the ocean, the elevations\" that made it \"potentially, the greatest course in the world\", he told the inquiry.</p> <p>The planning inspectors ruled that the damage to the dunes was outweighed by the resort's substantial value to the economy - a judgment challenged by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.</p> <p>\"It appears that the desires of one high profile overseas developer, who refused to compromise one inch, have been allowed to override the legal protection of this important site,\" said Aedan Smith, head of planning for RSPB Scotland.</p> <p>Martin Ford, the Liberal Democrat councillor whose casting vote against the development forced Scottish ministers to \"call in\" the plans, said: \"This is a very, very bad precedent indeed and sends out a bad message about the protection in Scotland of our natural heritage sites.</p> <p>\"It appears to me to be a vanity project. I don't think we can claim this is a nationally important development, and it certainly did not need to be built on this site.\"</p> <p>Critics of Trump's proposals, which also breach Aberdeenshire's local development plan by building homes on green belt, believe Scottish ministers have been over-awed by his reputation.</p> <p>Jack McConnell, the then Labour first minister of Scotland, met Trump twice in the US after his resort proposals emerged, facing accusations that his neutrality was being compromised. Salmond too was accused of being \"cavalier\" in his dealings with Trump and his aides after an investigation by MSPs at Holyrood.</p> <p>Trump, owner of the Miss World beauty pageants, has also been warned that he can only begin building the high rise timeshare blocks - already nicknamed \"the Benidorms\" by angry local residents - in stages after a certain number of affordable homes are completed.</p> <p>He must also ensure that local walkers and visitors will still have unimpeded access to the dunes under Scotland's strict right to roam legislation - rules Trump was unaware of until he was questioned by the Ramblers Association at the planning inquiry.</p>",
  "<p>Even as the squeeze in interbank lending has started to ease after the rescue of financial systems across the advanced countries, falling economic indicators have sent stock markets <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/22/pound-recession-interest-rates\">tumbling</a>. Pressures on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/29/hungary-forint-imf\">emerging-market countries</a>, which were once thought by many to have \"decoupled\" from the rest of the world, have intensified as foreign loans are called in and assets sold off. </p> <p>With fear gripping consumers, companies, and countries worldwide, talk has turned from a moderate advanced-country recession to a major world <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/edmundconway/3227454/Worst-slump-since-Great-Depression.html\">depression</a>. A sense of despondency has set in that nothing can be done to stop it. </p> <p>What is going on? Were the measures taken two weeks ago to <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/bankingFinancial/idUKL332467020081003\">shore up</a> the financial system simply wrong? Absolutely not. The provision of liquidity, the recapitalisation of banks, more uniform deposit insurance across the advanced countries \u2013 these were all correct and necessary measures. But they were only the first installment on what needs to be done. </p> <p>In the advanced countries, the fall in asset values and, more generally, fear of what comes next has shattered consumer and business confidence. Consumption is dropping, and companies are cutting investment. The financial crisis has created a sharp fall in demand, what economists call a <a href=\"\" http: en.wikipedia.org wiki keynesian_economics\">Keynesian recession</a>.\" </p> <p>To help confidence revive, there is no alternative but to use macroeconomic tools to boost demand and sustain output. Monetary policy can be used in countries where interest rates remain high, but its effectiveness in a credit squeeze is likely to be limited. Fiscal policy must, therefore, play a central role. Fiscal expansion is always risky, as it adds to debt and raises dangers later. But, given where we are, the benefits exceed the costs in countries with sustainable debt. </p> <p>Emerging-market countries face an additional problem. Not only must they contend with the prospect of falling exports and confidence; they also are the latest victims of a financial crisis that started in the United States, traveled to Europe, and now has swept across their borders. Foreign banks are cutting credit. Foreign investors are repatriating their funds on an unprecedented scale. Ironically, the measures being taken to resolve the crisis in advanced countries are making it more attractive to bring money home, making life harder for emerging-market countries.<br> In order to shore up their financial systems and overall demand, emerging-market countries must be ready to take actions similar to those pursued by the advanced countries. But the recent prosperity of many of these countries has come from access to global capital. A sudden stop to such flows is a severe blow and raises special challenges that cannot be solved by these countries alone. </p> <p>So the advanced countries must be ready to provide the required financing, and to do so on an unprecedented scale. The alternative is the prospect of widespread debt default, banking controls, and protectionism \u2013 an outcome that would set back these countries, and the global economy as a whole, for years to come. </p> <p>The IMF has the wherewithal to commit up to $250 billion. We have set in motion the internal procedures and facilities that will allow us to provide resources quickly, with conditions limited to the core crisis-policy response at hand. In addition, the <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/survey/so/2008/POL102908A.htm\">fund</a> is working on a new liquidity line to provide resources immediately to strongly performing emerging markets with sound policies and fundamentals. </p> <p>This should give confidence to investors. But, given the scale of capital flows, I am also urging the governments and central banks of the advanced countries to provide parallel financing to the IMF's crisis-response programs. I also am convinced of the need to find ways to bring into play the resources of countries with large reserves. The Fund will play its part, but all these actions are needed to reinforce the credibility of the coordinated global response to the crisis. </p> <p>We must also think ahead, especially in regard to low-income countries in Africa. Because of their limited participation in international financial markets, these countries have, so far, been somewhat shielded from the storm. But it is an uneasy calm that probably will not last. Many low-income countries will suffer from the decline in commodity prices. Others, including those that were becoming the new frontier in emerging markets, may see their access to foreign capital dry up. They, too, will need help from the international community. Lending by the IMF and global development banks, and the maintenance of donor aid at current levels, will be essential if we are to avoid new human tragedies. </p> <p>The dynamics of fear are potentially catastrophic, but these dynamics can be broken. Whatever the problems in the financial system, the massive improvements over the years in technology, productivity, and social progress \u2013 the real fundamentals \u2013 are a genuine testament to the power of globalisation as a force for good. It may be too late to avoid a recession in the advanced countries and a slowdown in emerging and low-income countries. But it is not too late to avoid a global depression. </p> <p><em>Dominique Strauss-Kahn is managing director of the International Monetary Fund. </em></p> <p><em>Copyright <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\">Project Syndicate</a> 2008. </em></p>",
  "<p>A year, as any beleaguered banker will tell you, is a long time in the markets. Banks crash, governments bail them out and the landscape of the City shifts forever.</p> <p>But in the cloistered colleges of Cambridge University it's a mere blip in financial history and the brightest academics in the land are banking on the good times rolling round once again.</p> <p>Clare College, Cambridge is attempting to cash in on the current economic crisis by borrowing money for the first time in its 700-year history to take advantage of cheaper shares.</p> <p>On the advice of some of its wealthiest alumni, it has borrowed \u00a315m on a 40-year inflation-linked loan, which, it hopes, will one day in the distant future reap a profit of \u00a336m.</p> <p>Only Oxbridge with its bulging endowment coffers could afford to squirrel away \u00a315m over such a long period of time, as Donald Hearn, Clare's bursar freely admits.</p> <p>\"Because we have a very, very long term perspective \u2013 we've been around for 700 years and plan to be around for at least 700 more \u2013 we have the advantage of not worrying about short term thresholds, he said.</p> <p>\"We are putting the \u00a315m away for 40 years and will not touch it for all that time.\"</p> <p>The college has borrowed the money at 1% interest to invest it in rock-bottom stocks and shares.</p> <p>The length and type of loan makes it the first of its kind for any British or American college, according to HSBC, who did all the work on the deal.</p> <p>Rather than a conventional loan paying back the same amount of money in 40 years plus interest, the inflation-linked loan means the college will have to pay back \u00a370m in 2048 but with a projected profit of \u00a336m.</p> <p>\"Because real interest rates adjusted for inflation are so unusually low it happened to be one of those occasions where we could borrow at 1% and it's almost inconceivable that inflation returns will be less than 1% in 40 years' time,\" Hearn said.</p> <p>Imperial College, London and Sheffield University have both taken long-term loans \u2013 50 and 40 years respectively \u2013 but on conventional terms, rather than inflation adjusted \u2013 and to spend on capital projects rather than investing in the market.</p> <p>The college has the priceless advice of several of Clare's alumni to thank for the innovative deal.</p> <p>They include Andrew Smithers, the investment guru who runs his own economic and financial consultancy and is a member of the college's investment committee.</p> <p>Norman Cumming, who runs hedge fund CR Global is also a committee member and the idea was discussed with Martin Weale, head of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. Weale shared Clare undergraduate tutorials with Cumming, and David Swensen, Yale's chief investment officer and also Clare fellow and alumni.</p> <p>\"We're all rude about bloody bankers but they have done a great deal of work and without the gurus that we have we would have been reluctant to get on board,\" Hearn said.</p> <p>\"They were absolutely crucial in convincing the college as a whole that this is a sensible way to go.\"</p> <p>Rather than a conventional loan paying back the same amount of money in 40 years plus interest, the inflation-linked loan means the college will have to pay back \u00a370m in 2048 but with a projected profit of \u00a336m.</p> <p>Cambridge University overall stands to lose \u00a311m from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/oct/16/universityfunding-oxforduniversity\">collapse of Iceland's banks</a>, while Oxford University's losses could be \u00a330m - small change in comparison with its \u00a3600m in annual cash deposits and \u00a33.4bn endowment fund.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble:</strong> The big guns have been summoned to Westminster this afternoon for a grilling by MPs who are conducting an urgent inquiry into the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/creditcrunch\">banking crisis</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/alistairdarling\">Alistair Darling</a>, the chancellor, Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, and Lord Turner of Ecchinswell, chairman of the Financial Services Authority, have been hauled before the Treasury select committee to answer questions on the causes of the banking crisis. </p> <p>MPs also want clarification about what responsibilities the banks and the government has to taxpayers.</p> <p>To spice up the proceedings, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/johnmcfall\">John McFall</a>, chairman of the committee, has for the first time asked members of the public to submit questions that the MPs will put to the heads of the so-called tripartite authority, which is responsible for the health of the financial system. I'm told more than 4,000 suggestions were submitted.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-339283660\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Politics/Pix/pictures/2008/11/03/mk4.jpg\" alt=\"Mervyn King Darling speaking to the Commons treasury committee\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mervyn King speaking to the Commons treasury committee. Photograph: PA</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The fun kicks off at 4pm.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>4:04pm:</strong> They are taking their seats.</p> <p>This is the first time the tripartite group has appeared together, McFall says.</p> <p>It's also the first time they have asked the public to submit questions - there were more than 5,000 in total he says.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>4:08pm:</strong> McFall starts with the chancellor - he asks how the crisis started.</p> <p>Darling says it started across the Atlantic and escalated to the point where banks stopped lending to each other, so the government had to step in.</p> <p>\"If you look at the money paid into Northern Rock, it is being paid slightly ahead of schedule,\" Darling says. \"The reason we are doing it is because it's necessary to restore the banking system because we all rely on it.\"</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>4:15pm:</strong> The \u00a337bn bailout, is that not an admission that banking regulation has failed? McFall asks Turner.</p> <p>He says it has been a global problem.</p> <p>McFall asks King if the taxpayer has been \"taken for a mug\".</p> <p>King insists recapitalisation was exactly the right response.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>4:20pm:</strong> McFall reads out another submitted question about where the money is coming from to pay for the bank bail-out.</p> <p>Darling says the government will borrow it in the normal way and details will be set out at the time of the pre-budget report.</p> <p>Conservative MP Michael Fallon asks the chancellor, if he takes responsibility for the boom, why not the bust?</p> <p>Darling says there are lessons to be learned but the problem is a deficiency in spotting the way problems build up not just in our own country but elsewhere as well.</p> <p>Fallon says Darling and Gordon Brown were responsible for all this; why not accept responsibility and say sorry?</p> <p>The chancellor says he accepts responsibility for things he is responsible for but in the future we must be aware of what banks are responsible for.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>4:24pm:</strong> The consequences of what happened in the American banking system were \"catastrophic\", Darling says. \"We need to keep a close eye on what is going on elsewhere.\"</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>4:23pm:</strong> Turner says the tripartite authority reached a decision that a bail-out of the British banking system was necessary. \"It was obvious in discussions that something radical had to be done to restore confidence,\" Turner says.</p> <p>They did \"extreme stress tests\" on bank assets. \"There was a process of developing stress tests that determined what was required to restore confidence,\" he says.</p> <p>It is put to Turner that the reason full confidence has not been restored is because banks fear there are still some \"toxic\" loans yet to be discovered. He rejects the suggestion, saying that it takes time to recover after such a big jolt to confidence.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>4:30pm:</strong> Darling is asked about banks failing to honour commitments to lend to individuals and small businesses at the same rate as last year.</p> <p>Darling says he is about to write to the committee to set out details of the body to oversee the government's stake in the banks. The treasury said earlier today that the arms' length body would closely monitor activity, especially lending to small businesses and the treatment of mortgage holders, but would not intervene in day-to-day decisions.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>4:32pm:</strong> Darling says they will publish the agreements they have with the banks.</p> <p>Darling is asked about city bonuses.</p> <p>The chancellor says anyone who uses the bank reconstruction arrangements will be treated the same way.</p> <p>\"There will be restrictions while the preference shares are there,\" he says.</p> <p>The sitting is suspended for 10 minutes while MPs attend a vote in the Commons.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>4:45pm:</strong> They're back.</p> <p>Hot of the press: George Osborne, the shadow chancellor (who is not at the committee) is apparently calling this afternoon for a full public inquiry into banking crisis. Witnesses should include not only regulators but Gordon Brown himself, the Tories say.</p> <p>Back to the committee...</p> <p>Conservative MP Graham Brady wants to know why people with money in Equitable Life aren't being treated the same way as people with money invested in banks and building societies.</p> <p>Darling says he understands the problem and has many constituents affected by the problem, but Equitable Life is a different issue and they hope to respond to the problem shortly.</p> <p>McFall comes back in to ask about the future of lending and deposits.</p> <p>King says, in the future, banks will need to generate new levels of funding.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>4:54pm:</strong> McFall asks Turner if there will be more \"imbalance\" in the future.</p> <p>\"I think there is going to be some sort of process of rebalancing,\" Turner says.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>4:47pm:</strong> Lord Thurso reads out a question about why HBOS and Lloyds should be merged. \"What are the pressing matters of financial stability which means [Lord] Mandelson has pushed aside competitive practices to let this go through?\" he adds.</p> <p>The only alternative was full scale nationalisation, which would have had very big consequences, King says. The merger was in the public interest and now that it's there on the table, you can't undo it, he says.</p> <p>Thurso asks the chancellor why it has now become a commercial decision which doesn't need any intervention any more?</p> <p>Darling says HBOS had to engage in a rights issue, which wasn't without its problems, and it became clear that the best thing to do was get involved with Lloyds TSB. He decided to allow this to happen in the interests of financial stability. It's up to the shareholders to decide if they want to vote for the merger, Darling says.</p> <p>\"It's open to anyone else to put in a bid,\" he says, \"But I say to you that so far no one else has come forward.\"</p> <p>The chancellor urges the committee to look at the Office of Fair Trading report into HBOS's financial situation and suggests that, even if the deal goes ahead, it is not necessarily out of the woods.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>5:04pm:</strong> Thurso asks about compensation for people with Bradford and Bingley shares. Darling says everyone feels very sorry for small shareholders in B&amp;B and they will be entitled to whatever is left when everyone else is paid off, but he admits the prospects \"aren't great\".</p> <p>Thurso asks if the shareholders have any recourse from directors who told them everything was ok. Darling says he would be careful about offering them legal advice.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>5:05pm:</strong> McFall says if you've got money in B&amp;B and a director stands up and says everything is ok and it goes bust four days later, is that not bad supervision?</p> <p>Turner says the markets were moving very fast.</p> <p>King is asked about his claim some time back that Northern Rock had a \"good quality loan book\".</p> <p>He says it followed advice from the FSA.</p> <p>The same question is put to Turner. The FSA chairman says there was no evidence at the time that the loan to value ratios were bad.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>5:13pm:</strong> Darling is asked why anti-terror laws were used to freeze the assets of the Icelandic bank.</p> <p>The chancellor said it was \"contemplated at the time that the powers may be used more widely\".</p> <p>\"We did need to step in to protect the interests of the British taxpayers. It is my job to protect the British taxpayer and I'm perfectly happy to stand up and do that,\" he says.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>5:15pm:</strong> MP Mark Todd asks what is being done to strengthen the FSA's grip on the banking sector.</p> <p>Turner says a very major programme - the supervisory programme - has been put in place with \"218 extra people on top of the 500 already there.\"</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>5:21pm:</strong> Turner is asked if any bonuses are being paid in the regulatory sector.</p> <p>He says some will be. \"We will not reward bad work but it is part of our remuneration package to reward good work,\" he says.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>5:27pm:</strong> MP Sally Keeble asks about credit ratings agencies.</p> <p>Darling says there are plans to regulate credit rating agencies across a number of countries.</p> <p>When is it going to happen? she asks.</p> <p>Darling says you need a solution certainly at a European level but also a global level and although it's \"frustratingly slow at times\" there is no point in Britain acting alone. \"You do need other countries involved in this,\" he says.</p> <p>\"I'm optimistic we will get something agreed with Europe if not the end of this year, then certainly some time next year,\" Darling adds. \"But a wider agreement, involving America, will take longer.\"</p> <p>Turner says credit rating agencies tried to predict the likelihood of single banks or companies defaulting and they were quite accurate on the whole, but over time it became clear that they were subject to much more rapid changes.</p> <p>Turner says credit rating agencies tried to predict the likelihood of single banks or companies defaulting and they were quite accurate on the whole, but over time it became clear that they were subject to much more rapid changes.</p> <p>He says he's not opposed to regulation of credit rating agencies but suggests they will be used more appropriately and won't be relied upon for information they are not qualified to give.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>5:40pm:</strong> There is another 10-minute break while MPs attend another Commons vote.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>5:50pm:</strong> They're back. McFall is asking Turner whether the boards of banks have run amok?</p> <p>Turner says they are going to have to think in future how even very competent people can go into enough detail.</p> <p>McFall asks the Bank of England governor if he is now going to \"stick his nose in individual institutions\".</p> <p>King says the fact that there is a crisis isn't evidence in itself that people in charge of banks have done something wrong.</p> <p>\"We needed, and now we are going to get, a regulation framework for banks... regulation of liquidity...\"</p> <p>How can we get better, more alert people in charge of banks? McFall asks.</p> <p>King says what he is suggesting would be putting the government in full charge of banks.</p> <p>MP Jim Cousins asks what is going to be done to help the housing market and home owners who are in difficulty?</p> <p>Darling replies that all banks and building societies are being asked to \"pursue every alternative to reposession\".</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>5.56pm:</strong> Darling says the constraints placed on Northern Rock are a result of European legislation on state aid.</p> <p>\"That is the reason Northern Rock is reducing its loan book at the moment,\" the chancellor says. \"In relation to people looking for mortgages, although mortgage availability isn't a problem now it will be when the housing market picks up and I've asked James Crosby [who is reviewing the mortgage market] to look at that.\"</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>6:04pm:</strong> Cousins asks the chancellor about the BBC's business editor Robert Peston. Darling says to laughter he can't answer for Peston. Cousins says there are suggestions Peston is \"the real governor of the BoE\" and asks about leaks of information.</p> <p>Turner says: \"There is no sign there is market abuse. There is leakage of information that shouldn't be leaked... we are troubled by that but we can only investigate that when there is sign of an offence against market rules.\"</p> <p>Turner says he will take what Cousins says and \"look into it further\". He adds \"We are troubled by that but we can only investigate that when there is sign of an offence against market rules. We are continually monitoring unusual movements in markets.\"</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>6:04pm:</strong> The committee moves on to the issue of the Icelandic bank.</p> <p>Darling again defends the steps he took to protect British taxpayers.</p> <p>\"Iceland has been having problems for some time,\" he says.</p> <p>Asked about depositors from the Isle of Man, Darling indicates that his obligation is only to people who put their deposits in UK branches.</p> <p>Michael Fallon, the committee's deputy chairman, accuses the chancellor of \"washing his hands\" of the people of the Isle of Man. Darling rejects this.</p> <p>The chancellor says that one thing this situation has shown is \"we need to have a long hard look at the relationship between this country and the Isle of Man, a tax haven\".</p> <p>There would be \"no knee-jerk reaction\" but Darling adds: \"It is something this committee might want to look into.\"</p> <p>And with that the evidence session was brought to a close.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordonbrown\">Gordon Brown</a> today issued an eve-of-election plea for the winner in the US presidential poll to show leadership during the global financial crisis.</p> <p>Barack Obama or John McCain will only be president-in-waiting when world leaders including the outgoing President Bush convene in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/23/creditcrunch-globaleconomy\">Washington on November 15</a> \u2013 the winner will be sworn in as president on January 20. </p> <p>But Brown said the world would need clear American leadership in the \"coming weeks and months\" during a speech to Arab businessmen on the penultimate day of his trip to the Middle East.</p> <p>Leaders of the world's 20 most developed nations are due in Washington in 10 days' time to thrash out new rules for revamped international cooperation.</p> <p>Brown said: \"The next stage of globalisation will require even more international cooperation with American leadership central to its success. In the coming weeks and months, the whole world will want to work closely with America on a shared common agenda to bring growth and jobs back to our economies; to give greater stability to our financial system; to defeat protectionism in favour of free trade; and of course to work for a more secure world and, in the Middle East, peace.\"</p> <p>Brown is thought to have discussed his ideas for a revamped IMF on at least one of the occasions he has met the presidential candidates.<br> In a speech to Gulf businessmen in Abu Dhabi on the third leg of his Gulf tour, Brown said he feared that countries retreating to isolation and protectionism might wreck chances for a quick and sustainable recovery.</p> <p>Brown seems to have had some success in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/nov/03/gordon-brown-saudi-arabia-qatar\">enlisting Gulf support</a> for his plan to see developed nations contribute funds to an emergency bail-out fund, the details of which will emerge in Washington. </p> <p>The prime minister has proposed a five-point plan for November 15 meeting:<br>\u2022 stronger banks and more lending;<br>\u2022 the restoration of confidence in the financial system;<br>\u2022 better coordination of fiscal and monetary policy;<br>\u2022 free trade;<br>\u2022 more money for the IMF, which he has spent the past three days drumming up from the oil-rich states. </p> <p>On Sunday, Brown said he expected the Saudis would contribute funds and Qatar's prime minister, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim, has pledged support, but confirmation will not come before the November 15 meeting. Brown said if the money was forthcoming, the IMF would need to be overhauled to reflect changed international relations. </p> <p>Despite being one of Brown's closest allies in the Gulf, the Qatar prime minister appeared to ridicule the his call for a fixed oil price. \"We wish that we have a fixed price but this is a market need [to have a variable oil price],\" Jassim said at a joint press conference with the prime minister in Doha. He said he thought a fair oil price was $70-90 (\u00a344-56).</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble:</strong> Evening. Newcastle have a task on their hands to haul themselves out of the basement tonight. Villa, with the astute if not a little eccentric Martin O'Neill manning the tiller, are a heavyweight proposition in the top-flight these days. They haven't tasted defeat since Chelsea turned <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/oct/06/premierleague.chelsea\"> them over 2-0</a> at Stamford Bridge and have plundered a whopping nine goals in their last three matches. The understanding cultivated between John Carew and Gabriel Agbonlahor has been key to Villa's good form. Big Bad John has been too much for defenders to handle at times this season, and despite reportedly being slapped with a \u00a3100,000 fine for <a href=\"http://www.birminghampost.net/midlands-birmingham-sport/west-midlands-sports/2008/10/29/john-carew-tells-of-strip-club-misunderstanding-65233-22143165/\"> 'mistakenly entering'</a> Birmingham's Rocket lap-dancing bar \u2013 where customer perks include <a href=\"http://images.icnetwork.co.uk/upl/icbirmingham/jan2005/5/5/0008A500-A957-11EF-B9CB80BFB6FA0000.jpg\"> 'The Best Bouncers In Town'</a> \u2013 on the morning of a match, his form appears undiminished. Providing Carew doesn't mistakenly turn up at Villa Park tonight , he'll start alongside Gabriel Agbonlahor in attack.</p> <p>Another key striker who often finds himself surrounded by sweaty mares (at the racecourse, I might add), is little Mickey O'. He's due to make yet another return from injury for Newcastle tonight, although with Obafemi Martins beginning to look sharp up top, Joe Kinnear might start Owen on the bench or play him in a deeper lying role behind Ameobi and Martins. The former Wimbledon manager appears to have instilled some belief back into his players since arriving at St James' Park. They've certainly got a competitive midfield. Joey Barton, Nicky Butt and Danny Guthrie aren't shy of giving an opponent a good clout. And in Senegal international Habib Beye they may have found an answer to some of their comedic defending. Toon fans have already taken to singing 'Monday , Tuesday Habib Beye,' to the tune of Happy Days in his honour. Beye's response: \"Monday, Tuesday, Habib Beye, yes, I like it. I used to watch Happy Days and know all about the Fonz. <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=H2i0QWXvOn0&quot;\"> The Fonz</a> was cool but I am cool too.\" I need say no more. </p> <p><strong>An early email:</strong> \"Mr Roughley,\" says Patrick Sullivan in Washington DC rather formally. \"In the spirit in what the U.S calls exercise of democracy, which is really an attempt to gerrymander [MBM frantically checks online dictionary and finds this definition: \"To divide (a geographic area) into voting districts so as to give unfair advantage to one party in elections.\" MBMer suddenly feels smarter than he did a minute ago.] one's way into an election that is essentially determined by voting trends in four states, thereby making the opinions of others irrelevant, I am curious to see if you can predict this match's outcome through analogy of the American election. Will refreshing Barack Villa defeat aging but loyal Newcastle McCain, or will those who think they deserve victory by virtue of conviction shock the world with an upset?\" Judging by recent US election trends Patrick, I suspect a particularly close race, a few dodgy decisions and an undeserved victory for Newcastle McCain. Just call it a hunch. <br><strong>My prediction:</strong> Newcastle McCain 2-1 Barack Villa</p> <p><strong>Teams to follow</strong>.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Here's Gary Naylor...</strong> \"In your photo, isn't John Carew saying, 'I wasn't at the strip club. It's always this size.'\" I presume you're referring to the size of his talent Gary?</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>The teams are in:</strong> </p> <p><strong>Newcastle:</strong> Given, Beye, Coloccini, Taylor, Jose Enrique,<br>Gutierrez, Barton, Butt, Duff, Martins, Ameobi. <strong>Subs:</strong> Harper,<br>Guthrie, Owen, Bassong, Cacapa, N'Zogbia, Geremi.</p> <p><strong>Aston Villa:</strong> Friedel, Luke Young, Cuellar, Laursen, Shorey,<br>Milner, Reo-Coker, Barry, Ashley Young, Agbonlahor, Carew. <strong>Subs:</strong><br>Guzan, Harewood, Davies, Knight, Salifou, Sidwell, Gardner.<br><strong>Referee:</strong> Steve Bennett (Kent) </p> <p>So Michael Owen starts on the bench for Newcastle, as does Guthrie as Joe Kinnear favours the experience of Nicky Butt. For Villa, Carew and Agbonlahor start up front and former Newcastle player James Milner gets a start on the right wing. In fact looking at the Villa team my 2-1 prediction in favour of Newcastle is looking a bit ropey.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Joe Kinnear</strong> seems a little confused as he gives an interview on Setanta. He reckons a win tonight will take Newcastle into the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague/tables\">top 10 in the Premier League</a>. Sorry Joe, but it'll take Newcastle up to 14th. Perhaps the altitude when he was coaching Nepal in the 1980s had a lasting, and confusing, effect.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>A disgruntled Fantasy Football fanatic writes:</strong> \"If Martin O'Neill keeps leaving Curtis Davies out of his starting 11 we're going to have words,\" growls James Kenny. \"He has been my standout <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fantasyfootball\">Guardian Fantasy Football</a> team player and now he is suddenly getting dropped for yesterday's nearly man Cuellar!\" Well he has dropped him again James. So, those words better be stern ones; like Eh! and Oy!</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>Pre-match build-up:</strong> The Blaydon Races can be heard blaring out of the PA system on a chilly looking evening in Newcastle. The teams make their way onto the pitch and we'll shortly be underway.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p>\"Dear Mr. Roughley,\" writes another formal reader, this time the ever so polite Paul Jackson in Baltimore. \"Doesn't the 'Happy Days' theme begin with \"Sunday, Monday Happy Days'? So shouldn't it have read, \"Sunday, Monday, Habib Beye\"? As a child of the TV age I couldn't help but point that out. Does this reflect poorly on the level of intelligence of Toon fans, given that they now can't even seem to get TV theme lyrics correct? I hope not. As a Yank Toon Fan I find them more loveable than the management/players for the most part.\" Perhaps they were too busy watching <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IqznlB1GhI\">Jossie's Giants</a> Paul.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> We're off! And Joey Barton immediately launches himself into a bone-crunching tackle with Reo-Coker. He wins the ball and lays down a marker.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> Villa have the better of possession in the early exchanges, with Newcastle looking a little tentative as they look to play the ball forward quickly.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> Martins forces Luke Young to play a difficult pass back to Friedel. His clearance is picked up by Duff, who crosses low and hard, but Laursen clears.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> This is better from Newcastle. Martins has a pop from 25 yards but his shot is deflected for a corner. Duff knocks the corner in, but Villa have some huge players in the box and clear the aerial threat quite comfortably.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> Ashley Young clears and Carew gathers it on his chest, under no real pressure from Colocinni. He thens ambles up the right wing and buys a corner off Colocinni.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>10 min:</strong> Villa captain Gareth Barry swings the corner into the six-yard box. Given chooses to stay on his line and Laursen jumps highest and shaves the left hand post with a glancing header. Newcastle need to be strong in the air.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>12 min:</strong> Ameobi <em>is</em> strong in the air as he outjumps Laursen and flicks Given's goal kick to Martins' feet. He turns sharply inside Cuellar, who looks somewhat cumbersome, and lashes a powerful shot a couple of yards over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> Newcastle are giving Barry and Reo Coker little time on the ball in midfield. This time Butt wins back possession and works the ball back to Given. But he humps the ball forward to no-one in particular. Back to the picture: \"Perhaps in the photo John's wondering why a Norwegian is wearing gloves and a short-sleeved shirt,\" reckons Keith McIntyre. It's been positively Baltic in Britain recently Keith. I suspect you're emailing from your laptop on a deck chair in some sunny part of the States. Am I right?</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>17 min:</strong> Barton gets his buttocks in the way to prevent Agbonlahor from winning the ball. Agbonlahor throws Barton over his shoulder and somehow Villa get a free-kick in a dangerous area on the right of Newcastle's goal. Barton is given a talking-to by Steve Bennett, and as is his way in these reformed days, he puts his arm around Bennett statesman-like and walks away a better man. Villa then waste the free-kick, much to the Toon fans' pleasure.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>20 min:</strong> Apart from a few tasty tackles it's been a poor match.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>21 min:</strong> Oh hang on! A bit of decent football. Big Bad John Carew brings a long ball down with his ripped six-pack turns sharply and finds Milner on the right. He skips away from Coloccini and plays a come-and-spank-me cross to Agbonlahor, who completely misses the ball and belies his great form this season. Oh and he's in my fantasy team too.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>23 min:</strong> More action! Barry is booked for tripping Gutierrez, who goes down far too easy - the soft sod. Barton then picks up a headed clearance 30 yards out and drives a low shot off the slippery turf which Friedel does well to gather in his chunky midfriff.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>25 min:</strong> Did I say this game was poor? It's warming up nicely now. Milner turns inside his marker, and from 25 yards out, drives a shot at goal which, for a moment looks like it's about to trouble Given, but actually sails high over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>27 min:</strong> Villa fans inform the Toon faithful that their team is 'going down, going down, going down'. I presume they're singing that because they haven't got anything as original as Habib Beye's 'Happy Days' song - even if the Newcastle fans get the words wrong.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>30 min:</strong> Martins turns Laursen inside out on the right hand corner of the 18-yard box, he then shifts the ball onto his left foot 12 yards out but crashes his shot wide. If he'd have shown more composure there he could have put Newcastle ahead.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>33 min:</strong> Barton is trying to pull the strings for Newcastle, but on this occasion he pings a ball into the feet of Ameobi who can't untangle his legs and has the ball stolen off him by Cuellar.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> <strong>Great save from Shay Given! </strong>Agbonlahor beats Coloccini on the right wing and finds Ashley Young in the six yard-box. He shifts the ball onto his right foot and hammers the ball at point blank range straight into the chest of Given, who stays big ala Schmeichel, and deflects the ball over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>38 min:</strong> Ashley Young wastes the corner and Newcastle clear. A shush descends on the stadium and referee Steve Bennett can be quite clearly heard every few seconds shouting \"don't foul him\". Luke Young then does exactly this to Gutierrez and is booked for it. He can't say he wasn't warned.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>40 min:</strong> Martins looks like Newcastle's chief threat. He's the only real player in their team, perhaps barring Duff with the wind behind him, with any real pace.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>42 min:</strong> \"John Carew's ripped six-pack, Brad Friedel's chunky midriff...\" begins Tom Chivers, \"have you got a torso fetish, Mr Vaguely, or are you just concerned that you're letting yourself go a little?\" I think you're onto something Tom. Subconsciously I think I yearn for a washboard to thump a medicine ball off. Meanwhile at St James' Park. Beye ventures forward and curls a low cross invitingly towards Steven Taylor, but being a central defender, he ponders and watches the ball race past him instead of instinctively throwing a leg at the ball.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>Half-time:</strong> Well that petered out after a promising opening. Apart from Given's stunning save from Ashley Young and Friedel's stop from Barton there was very little for either keeper to do. I'm off for a half-time cuppa. Your emails to follow...</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>Half-time emails:</strong> Is Steve Bennett's instruction \"don't foul him\" allowed?\" enquires Mike Brown. \"What does the rule book say about refs giving coaching lessons during a match I wonder?\" I don't think there's any issue with it Mike. I'd imagine the FA would have a problem with it if he was jumping around shouting \"break his f***ing legs\" though. </p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p>Setanta have just shown a replay of Joey Barton flicking Agbonlahor's lips in the first half. I've got to say that boy is good. He got that one past my eagle eyes, and Steve Bennett's, expertly. It didn't seem that bad, but <em>The Rage</em> is obviously still bubbling nicely within the facade that is <em>New Barton</em>.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> We're back underway. Ashley Young goes scampering down the right wing immediately and plays a low cross towards Agbonlahor on the back post, but 'Sunday, Monday, Habib Beye' comes hurtling in front of Agbonlahor and clears for a corner.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> Barry swings the corner into the six-yard box but Newcastle clear the danger.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>48 min:</strong> Villa have started the second-half with a little more urgency than Newcastle. Although, after a tepid first-half that doesn't take much. Ashley Young clashes heads with Gutierrez and falls to the floor clutching his bonce. A lull in play.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> Ameobi backs into Laursen and somehow wins a free-kick. Jose Enrique wastes the opportunity though. Villa win a corner. But again it doesn't beat the first man.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>50 min:</strong> <em>New Barton</em> again shows that <em>The Rage</em> is bubbling beneath the surface as he stamps on the ball and Luke Young's ankles and receives a booking for his trouble. He reminds me of Michael J Fox in Teen Wolf. He's desperately trying to contain the beast within.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>53 min:</strong> Barton then releases Martins down the left. Cuellar kicks Martins into the scoreboard. The little striker throws the mother of all tantrums as he protests that Cuellar should be booked, and is deservedly booked himself for being a whining sod.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>56 min:</strong> After all that hullabaloo the free-kick is wasted. The set pieces haven't been good from either side tonight.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>Goal!!! 58 min Newcastle 1-0 Aston Villa:</strong> Barton plays a neat ball into the right hand channel for Martins, who shrugs Laursen off with a sharp turn for the second time tonight and lashes a brilliant low drive into the bottom right hand corner. He might be a whining sod, but he deserved that for his efforts tonight.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> The match has been largely poor apart from that moment of class from Martins. Barton has been Newcastle's other chief threat tonight (not just physically) so it is apt that he was instrumental in providing the assist. As for Villa, Barry has never really got the midfield working and too many long balls have been humped up towards Carew.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>63 min:</strong> Newcastle are passing the ball much better now. It's amazing what a goal can do for a team's confidence. Conor Coen writes: \"Be honest Gregg , you've been waiting a long while to work this line into your play by play...'He reminds me of Michael J Fox in Teen Wolf. He's desperately trying to contain the beast within.'\" Honestly Conor, I haven't. I was sat in a dingy flat, drunk on Halloween and happened to end up watching the film again for the first time in years. So maybe I've been waiting four days.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> Duff is fouled on the edge of the penalty area. Nicky Butt pulls rank on Barton and clatters the post with a curled effort from 20 yards. Martins then slaloms past three defenders as he cuts in from the left, before Laursen nicks the ball away from him. This is good from Newcastle.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> Barton wins a corner on the left which Duff swings in. Carew, who has looked like he'd rather be in The Rocket Club so far, hooks the ball into the air and Butt, bouyed by his previous effort on goal, shows little composure and thwacks the ball into the Gallowgate End.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>70 min:</strong> As if to sum up what a bad night Carew is having, Nicky Butt - all 5ft 9in of him - outjumps the 6ft 5in Norwegian to clear a rare Villa attack.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong> 71 min:</strong> Martin Laursen gets a forearm in the face from Ameobi and is booked for his trouble. A moment later, Laursen returns the favour, but escapes a booking. If I was American I'd say: go figure!</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>74 min:</strong> Nicky Shorey is replaced by Steve Sidwell as Villa look to win the midfield battle and work the ball forward on the floor.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>76 min:</strong> Sidwell brings little finesse to proceedings though as he lunges into a tackle with the game's star performer Obafemi Martins. He is deservedly shown a yellow card.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>78 min:</strong> The match has descended into a bitty, nasty spectacle, which will suit Newcastle as they look to hold onto their lead.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>80 min:</strong> Ameobi receives a long ball in the right hand corner and holds the ball up with aplomb. He wastes a few seconds with some rubber-legged stepovers and holds off a few defenders before... wasting possession.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>Goal!!! Newcastle 2-0 Aston Villa, Martins 82 min:</strong> Gutierrez and Duff exchange passes on the left wing. Gutierrez draws his defender in towards him and then races to the by-line. He cuts the ball back inside and finds Martins a yard from goal, who simply taps the ball into the empty net. Well deserved on the balance of play.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>84 min:</strong> A concerned Villa fan called Nathan, currently residing in Amsterdam, writes: \"Bugger me! Just when it's the time for the Villa to grasp the moment, assert our credentials as the real deal \u2013 now that Arsenal are slipping \u2013 we appear to be bottling it. I wish I had something witty or incisive to say. But I don't. That's the truth of it. It's just painful. Mind you, at least we don't have that thug Barton playing for us...\" No Nathan, if you had Barton on your team tonight you might have scored a goal. Perish the thought...</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>87 min:</strong> Man of the match Obafemi Martins is substituted to a huge round of applause. Cacapa replaces him.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> Newcastle fans 'ole' every pass now as Villa look consigned to defeat. I suppose they should be allowed their small moments of pleasure, they've had precious little else to enjoy so far this season.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>89 min:</strong> Beye stings Friedel's palms with an angled drive from 12 yards. Villa break and win a corner which is cleared to Sidwell; but his strike goes yards over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>90+1 min:</strong> Shola Ameobi, who has worked his long socks off, is replaced by a grinning Michael Owen. His first touch is a pass to Duff who works the ball back to the Newcastle defence. Given receives the ball and clears long to Gutierrez.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>Full-time:</strong> Duff jinks through the Villa midfield and referee Steve Bennett blows his whistle really loud to bring an end to play.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>Full-time musings:</strong> What a strange weekend (and no, not the Teen-Wolf party). All four of the Premier League's bottom clubs won. Villa showed very little of the attacking prowess that has made them an exciting team to watch this season, but Newcastle clearly wanted it more. Joe Kinnear doesn't appear to have altered Newcastle's tactics any great deal, but he has instilled steel into the Magpies defence and midfield, which is making them difficult to break down in open play. Barton's return hasn't been heralded by many, but his nous, together with his competitive spirit, has clearly helped the Magpies. The problem for Kinnear - and a nice problem this is too - is how to fit Michael Owen into the frontline with Ameobi and Martins. Perhaps poor Mickey O' is going to find himself left out by England and Newcastle too. Thanks for all your emails.</p>",
  "<p>Now that the shock waves touched off by <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/5353208.stm\">Pope Benedict XVI's remarks</a> at Regensburg on September 12 2006 have subsided, the overall consequences have proven more positive than negative. Above and beyond polemics, the Pope's lecture has heightened general awareness of their respective responsibilities among Christians and Muslims in the west.</p> <p>It matters little whether the Pope had simply mis-spoken or, as the highest-ranking authority of the Catholic church, was enunciating church policy. Now the issue is one of identifying those areas in which a full-fledged debate between Catholicism and Islam must take place. Papal references to \"jihad\" and \"Islamic violence\" came as a shock to Muslims, even though they were drawn from a quotation attributed to Byzantine emperor <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_II_Palaiologos\">Manuel II Palaiologos</a>. It is clear that the time has come to open debate on the common theological underpinnings and the shared foundations of the two religions. The appeal by Muslim men of religion, \"<a href=\"http://www.acommonword.com/\">A Common Word</a>\", had precisely this intention: our traditions have the same source, the same single God who calls upon us to respect human dignity and liberty. These same traditions raise identical questions concerning the ultimate purpose of human activity, and respect for ethical principles.</p> <p>In a world that is experiencing an unprecedented global crisis, a world in which politics, finance and relations between humans and the environment suffer from a cruel lack of conscience and ethical integrity, it is a matter of greatest urgency that Christian-Muslim dialogue turn its attention to both theological issues and to those of values and ultimate aims. Our task is not to create a new religious alliance against the \"secularised\" and \"immoral\" world order, but to make a constructive contribution to the debate, to prevent the logic of economics and war from destroying what remains of our common humanity.</p> <p>Our constructive dialogue on shared values and ultimate goals is far more vital and imperative than our rivalries over the number of believers, our contradictory claims about proselytism, and sterile competition over exclusive possession of the truth. Those dogma-ridden individuals who, in both religions, claim truth for themselves, are, in fact, working against their respective beliefs.</p> <p>Whoever claims that he alone possesses the truth, that \"falsehood belongs to everybody else ... \" has already fallen into error. Our dialogue must resist the temptation of dogmatism by drawing upon a comprehensive, critical and constantly respectful confrontation of ideas. Ours must be a dialogue whose seriousness requires of us, above all else, humility.</p> <p>We must delve deep into history the better to engage a true dialogue of civilisations. Fear of the present can impose upon the past its own biased vision. Surprisingly, the Pope asserted that Europe's roots were Greek and Christian, as if responding to the perceived threat of the Muslim presence in Europe. His reading, as I noted after the lecture at Regensburg, is a reductive one. We must return to the factual reality of the past, to the history of ideas. When we do so, it quickly becomes clear that the so-called opposition between the west and Islam is pure projection, an ideological instrument if you will, designed to construct entities that can be opposed or invited to dialogue, depending on circumstances.</p> <p>But the west has been shaped by Islam, just as Islam has been shaped by the west; it is imperative that a critical internal process of reflection begin: that the west and Europe initiate an internal debate, exactly as must Islam and the Muslims, with a view to reconciling themselves with the diversity and the plurality of their respective pasts.</p> <p>The debate between faith and reason, and over the virtues of rationalism, is a constant in both civilisations, and is as such far from exclusive to the Greek or Christian heritage; nor is it the sole prerogative of the Enlightenment. The Pope's remarks at Regensburg have opened up new areas of inquiry that must be explored and exploited in a positive way, with a view to building bridges and, working hand in hand, to seeking a common response to the social, cultural and economic challenges of our day.</p> <p>It is in this spirit that I will be participating on <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKTRE49T51N20081030\">November 4, 5 and 6 in Rome</a>, and in the meeting with the Pope scheduled for November 6. Our task will be to assume our respective and shared responsibilities, and to commit ourselves to working for a more just world, in full respect of beliefs and liberties. It is essential, then, to speak of freedom of conscience, of places of worship, of the \"argument of reciprocity\"; all questions are possible in an atmosphere of mutual confidence and respect.</p> <p>Still, it is essential that each of us sit down at the table with the humility that consists of not assuming that we alone possess the truth; with the respect that requires that we listen to our neighbours and recognise their differences; and, finally, the coherence that summons each of us to maintain a critical outlook in accepting the contradictions that may exist between the message and the practice of believers. These are the essential elements to be respected if we are to succeed.</p>",

And a fisherman, Michael Forbes, whose farm lies in the middle of the site initially approved, has insisted he will <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/oct/10/golf.scotland\">never sell his land to Trump</a>.</p> <p>The plans were first approved in principle by the local Formartine area committee of Aberdeenshire council last year.</p> <p>But the council's infrastructure committee, led by the Liberal Democrat councillor Martin Ford, then sparked uproar among supporters by voting to turn down the resort application.</p> <p>Ford said today he was \"extremely disappointed\" by the decision.</p> <p>\"This is a very, very bad precedent indeed and sends out a bad message about the protection in Scotland of our natural heritage sites.

  "<p>The Great Exhibition held in the Crystal Palace in London's Hyde Park in 1851 was, so the late Clive Wainwright, a much missed curator at the Victoria and Albert museum, told me, a \"great opportunity to go shopping\" for millions of British people who could never have seen, let alone imagined, anything like a modern mall such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/gallery/2008/oct/24/westfield-shopping-centre?picture=338951077\">Westfield</a>, the \u00a31.7bn Australian-owned retail complex that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/gallery/2008/oct/30/retail-shopping-westfield-london?picture=339167995\">opened to a deafening fanfare</a> in west London this week.</p> <p>Wainwright's idea made me sit up and think. I'd always thought, a little unthinkingly, of the Great Exhibition as a stirring, if sometimes kitsch, celebration of all that was meant to be best in British and British imperial design in the middle of the 19th century. But, Wainwright was right. The Crystal Palace was indeed a progenitor of today's colossal shopping malls. Some of the malls and other big shops built in Britain in the 1980s even borrowed more or less directly from the design of Joseph Paxton's revolutionary iron and glass exhibition hall.</p> <p>Significantly, the vast Westfield mall occupies the site of what, long ago, had been the legendary White City, a fairytale gathering of exhibition halls in the guise of exotic palaces designed by the Hungarian engineer and showman Imre Kiralfy. For a number of years, the White City, first opened for the 1908 Franco-British exhibition, was a playground for Londoners. It stood empty for several decades before the last surviving of its buildings, long shorn of fancy decoration, were demolished in the 1990s. I remember walking through these lofty halls when the biggest were nothing more than giant aviaries for distinctly messy feral pigeons and the haunt of scuttling rats.</p> <p>So, Westfield has opened in the right place. White City is the spiritual home of the contemporary shopping mall, which is as much a place to buy things as it is a place to seek entertainment and amusement and, indirectly, to make an exhibition of ourselves. The big ambition of Westfield is very much a reflection of who we have become in Britain over the past 150 years, a nation of shopkeepers and avid shoppers crazy for ever more bangles and beads as long as they are \"branded\" made by sweated labour in developing countries and implausibly expensive.</p> <p>The huge new buildings, designed largely in-house by Westfield architects are far, far less interesting from a design point of view than either Kiralfy's White City or Paxton's Crystal Palace. They look like a cross between a giant 1980s airport terminal and, well, a big, brash and shiny shopping mall of the sort you might expect to find anywhere today from Des Moines to Dubai via Shanghai and Sydney. </p> <p>Originally, this mega mall with its chain stores, interspersed with unlikely branches of Neal's Yard, the independent Covent Garden cheese shop, and Rigby &amp; Peller, purveyors of undergarments to HM Queen Elizabeth II, multi-screen cinema, chain cafes and bling'n'branded luxury good outlets, for celebrities, footballers and credit card junkies, was to have been designed in an adventurous, tented way by the London architect Ian Ritchie. But, who wants innovation when there is so much more to buy and sell than Paxton's Crystal Palace could ever have offered? </p> <p>Perhaps there are people in London who have never walked through a shiny, mega mall like Westfield before and who might well be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/video/2008/oct/30/westfield-shopping-centre-opening\">impressed by its bright lights, sheer scale and the daunting range of costly gewgaws on sale inside</a>. Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, is certainly impressed. Good luck to him, the Westfield company and anyone else who feels the need for yet another giant mall. My own preference for traditional city streets, a mix of architecture historic and new, covered markets, street markets, independent shops and a sense of normal, everyday life - birdsong, dogs, passing traffic, sun, showers, frost and snow - will mean very little to the millions who will come here to mill around, gawp, spend and lark about as the crowds once did in the long forgotten halls of White City and the burned down naves and aisles of the Crystal Palace.</p> <p>If you've seen the Disney film Wall-E, you'll certainly recognise Westfield and malls like it. In the film, humans who long ago abandoned the Earth they messed up through greed, live a supremely sedentary life shopping and eating. They are very tubby and have lost the use of their legs. Is this how we'll end up? Or will we plunge into the depths of some <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/24/retail-recession-westfield\">mammoth recession</a> or some fearful age of global warming, or cooling, and end up with nothing and nowhere to spend?

In a letter to shareholders outlining the terms, the Lloyds TSB chairman, Sir Victor Blank, said the bank expected to buy back the \u00a34bn of so-called preference shares issued to the Treasury during 2009. </p> <p>Under the government's \u00a337bn plan to bail out part of the British banking system, it is buying preference shares that it must be paid back before ordinary shareholders can receive dividends again. </p> <p>\"The Lloyds TSB board recognises the importance of dividends to shareholders and its clear intention is to achieve the repurchase of the enlarged group preference shares during 2009 so as to enable it to resume the payment of dividends,\" said Blank.</p> <p>Despite competition concerns, the government has waived through a takeover of HBOS, owner of Halifax and Bank of Scotland. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/nov/03/lloydstsbgroup-hbos1\">The enlarged \"superbank\" will be known as Lloyds Banking Group</a>, it emerged today.</p> <p>HBOS today said its hit from the value of risky assets and bad loans topped \u00a35bn for the nine month period.</p> <p>The letter to investors came as Lloyds TSB warned that its profits for the first nine months of the year had suffered \"a substantial reduction\" due to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketturmoil\">turmoil in financial markets</a> as well as the rising level of bad debts. </p> <p>It said it would have to write off a further \u00a3420m in the second half, the lion's share relating to the growing number of business customers defaulting on their loans. Of that figure, \u00a3120m related to its mortgage book as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/housingmarket\">house prices continue to fall</a>.</p> <p>The circular to shareholders confirmed its offer to pay 0.605 Lloyds TSB shares for every HBOS share as part of a government brokered takeover. It will ask shareholders to approve the deal next month, with the expectation it will complete in January.</p> <p>By 1pm Lloyds TSB shares were off nearly 4% at 190p while HBOS gained 4% to 103.35p, helped by a weekend report of a potential counterbid led by Scottish financier Jim Spowart.</p> <p>Lloyds stepped in to rescue HBOS after its rival was hit by the deepening global financial crisis and concerns about its exposure to the weakening UK housing market.</p> <p>Both banks were forced to recapitalise under the government's rescue plan, taking a combined \u00a317bn from the sale of preference shares to the UK government and from the issue of equity guaranteed by the state.</p> <p>There had been concerns that investors will not receive a dividend for several years until preference shares sold to the government had been repaid.</p>",
  "<p>Anti-Americanism doesn't just manifest itself at the dining tables of fashionable London or at routine flag-burning displays in the Middle East. It has serious practical consequences too. Hostile public opinion in Turkey prevented American troops from invading Iraq from the north, seriously complicating the whole war. In Poland and the Czech Republic it has delayed cooperation with Washington on missile defence. Many American businesses and tourists will also testify to the problem. But are we getting the full story from Pew and the other pollsters that aim to teach us about the world's view of the United States? New opinion polling, conducted for <a href=\"http://americaintheworld.typepad.com/\">AmericaInTheWorld</a>, questions three components of the conventional wisdom on anti-Americanism.</p> <p>First of all we found that British citizens may make anti-American noises in the abstract but they still look to America when the chips are down. We are all too familar with <a href=\"http://pewglobal.org/americaagainsttheworld/\">those surveys</a> that find that many Europeans regard America as a greater threat to world peace than Iran. Our demographically balanced survey of nearly 2,000 British citizens tried to probe more deeply. We asked respondents to imagine that they had been taken prisoner by terrorists and that they had to be rescued by troops from a foreign nation. More than half (53%) said that they would most want to be rescued by the American military. Less than 1% preferred their liberators to be Iranian soldiers. Nearly five times as many Britons wanted the Stars and Stripes to be on their rescuers' uniform than wanted to see the flags of Germany or France. America scored almost as highly when we asked British people to choose a nation that they would like to work or holiday in.</p> <p>The second misconception concerns <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a>. The likely election of Barack Obama as America's next president will have an electric effect on global opinion but it will not cure every form of anti-Americanism. We found that his current popularity might struggle to survive the real challenges of presidential office. To a large extent we found that he is damned whatever course of action he chooses. For example, 51% of Britons would think less of him if he approved a military strike against Iran but 52% would also rate him less favourably if he failed to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. The course of action most likely to erode his support within Britain would be protectionist measures that stopped UK businesses from enjoying free access to US markets. Seventy per cent of British citizens would feel less warmly about him should he pursue such protectionism. A President Obama offers no inoculation against the unpopular responsibilities that burden the world's superpower.</p> <p>The third piece of conventional wisdom treats anti-Americanism as a rational phenomenon. Anti-Americanism is often understood to be a response to the mishandling of the Iraq war or of Washington's failure to ratify the Kyoto treaty on global warming. These factors certainly explain much of the rise in anti-Americanism documented by Pew but they don't tell the full story. Our survey found that much anti-Americanism is based in ignorance. We asked our panel of British voters to say whether certain factual statements about America were true or false. We found that Britons were consistently prone to inaccurately think the worst of America. They wrongly believed that America had sold Saddam Hussein a large share of his weaponry. In reality China, Russia and France had armed the former Iraq dictator.</p> <p>They wrongly believed the US was performing worse than Europe on CO2 emissions. Many also believed that emergency medical treatment was unavailable to America's poor and that polygamy was protected by US courts. These misconceptions exist in a nation widely regarded as America's best friend. The ignorance and associated negativity may be much worse in nations with less historical and cultural empathy.</p> <p>Anti-Americanism is not going to disappear when President Bush leaves the White House or when the Iraq war fades in the memory. It is a more complex phenomenon than most analyses suggest. The world's top power has always been resented. Perspectives are often contradictory. Some hate America for its religious conservatism. Others hate America's social liberalism and the violent output of Hollywood. Some protest against America for intervening in the world. Some for washing its hands of global responsibilities. I do not argue that America should ignore world opinion but it should not believe that world opinion is as simple as some opinion polls suggest.</p>",

  "<p>Britain will suffer a deeper <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/recession\">recession</a> than any other mature EU economy, with a contraction of 1% next year and only 0.4% growth in 2010, the European commission said today.</p> <p>The EC's latest half-yearly forecast predicts UK <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/unemploymentdata\">unemployment</a> will rise from 5.3% in 2007 to 7.1% in 2009 \u2014 which would bring the number out of work to about 2.25 million.</p> <p>It expects the budget deficit to jump to 5.6% next year, which would be around \u00a380bn, and 6.5%, or \u00a394bn, in 2010. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/governmentborrowing\">Government debt </a>is forecast to rise by more than 15 percentage points to more than 60% of GDP in 2010-11. The figures would break stability and growth limits set by the EU's stability and growth pact.</p> <p>The bleak EU forecasts blow a hole in the government's assertion it has been running the EU's model economy for the past decade.</p> <p>Britain's contraction will be worse even that that of Ireland, which is forecast to shrink 0.9% in 2009 but recover to 2.4% growth in 2010. Ireland's budget deficit is forecast to be higher, at 6.8% of GDP in 2009 and 7.2% in 2010.</p> <p>Only Estonia and Latvia are expected to suffer deeper recessions in 2009, contracting 1.2% and 2.7% respectively. Germany, France and Italy, the eurozone's three biggest economies, are expected to stagnate.</p> <p>Presenting his \"dark\" forecast, Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, economic and monetary affairs commissioner, said it was highly uncertain and volatile given the fragile state of global financial markets.</p> <p>He indicated tension had eased in inter-bank lending after the co-ordinated stabilisation plans adopted by governments in recent weeks.</p> <p>But he insisted the EC would stick to its revised stability and growth pact, with the UK expected to receive a warning early in the new year. The UK is already in the so-called excessive deficit procedure but cannot be sanctioned as it is not part of the eurozone.</p> <p>Senior EC economists said: \"The central outlook (for Britain) envisages a marked fall in private consumption in 2009 and 2010, driven by more restrictive borrowing conditions and lower household wealth.\"</p> <p>Presenting a bleak picture of falling housing prices, falling living standards and rising joblessness, they said: \"The heightened unemployment risk is also likely to prompt increases in savings from their currently very low level.\" </p> <p>The EC is forecasting a gradual recovery in the eurozone and most of the rest of the 27 EU member states in the second half of next year but this is unlikely in Britain until 2010, with business investment shrinking until the end of 2009. Inflation is likely to fall to 1.2% in 2010.</p> <p>The forecast comes ahead of this week's expected decisions by both the bank of England and European Central Bank to cut interest rates by up to 0.5 percentage points as governments adopt fiscal stimulus packages to help lead the way out of recession across Europe.</p>",
  "<p>Tomorrow, MPs have the chance to strike a blow for social justice and represent society's abhorrence of racism and fascism. Amendments to the employment bill <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/nov/02/trade-unions-bnp-far-right\">are coming before the Commons</a> to restore to trade unions some of the rights lost during the long years of the Thatcher-neoliberal consensus (remember that?).</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.hopenothate.org.uk/Reinstate18/\">The central amendment</a>, backed by the trade union group of MPs and the campaigning anti-fascist magazine Searchlight, seeks to reverse a decision in the Lords that restricts the right of unions to exclude or expel active fascists from our ranks.</p> <p>The European court of human rights has found that the 1992 Tory <a href=\"http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1992/ukpga_19920052_en_1\">trade union and labour relations act</a> is in violation of the right to freedom of association under the European convention on human rights. Workers should be free to join a trade union without sanction, and so too should the trade union be free to choose its own members. </p> <p>This amendment is vital if unions are to be able to exclude British National Party activists and other active racists from membership. As the economy slides into recession, experience teaches us that racists will most likely step up their activities and try and blame social problems on migrants or black people generally.</p> <p>Trade unions are a bulwark against this poison. Our aim is to fight for social justice for all working people in unity. We will resist any effort to set workers against each other.</p> <p>That is why active support for fascists and racists is, and should be, incompatible with trade union membership. Trade unions should be free to use their own democratic procedures, without state interference, to control the right to membership. Amendment NC6 will simply repeal Section 174 of the 1992 act, giving trade unions back their right to act against active racists and ensuring that UK law is in compliance with European standards.</p> <p>Other amendments are scarcely less important if the industrial relations playing field is at long last to have a semblance of balance. Currently, the duties placed on trade unions to provide employers with notice of ballots and industrial action place are onerous, costly and excessively complicated. They expose unions to applications for injunctions by employers to prevent industrial action taking place, even where a clear majority have voted to support the action. A new clause will introduce greater fairness by cutting the \"red tape\" that unions face. Employers would be required to supply trade unions with information they need to comply with notice and balloting requirements. </p> <p>All workers should also be protected from suffering detriment or being sued as a result of their taking part in industrial action, other than appropriate deductions from the worker's wages. A further amendment will mean that all workers have the right to take official industrial action free from the fear of dismissal or victimisation.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.ilo.org/global/lang--en/index.htm\">International Labour Organisation</a> has repeatedly found that UK law is in breach of international human rights treaties by failing to provide this protection. The effect of one amendment would be to establish that dismissals made in anticipation of, during or after lawful industrial action would be void unless the employer can show that the reason for the dismissal was unconnected. </p> <p>Regulation currently bars employment agencies from supplying agency workers to carry out duties normally performed by a worker undertaking lawful strike action. A loophole in the law, however, means that this duty does not apply if the agency does not know that the agency worker is replacing a worker taking industrial action. A further amendment would close this loophole. </p> <p>These are all modest measures, which perhaps, now that the days of deregulation as a panacea are past, MPs can finally adopt.</p>",

  "<p>President Bush has taken a welcome step by <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-bush23-2008oct23,0,877363.story\">inviting the G-20 to Washington</a> on November 15 to discuss the global financial crisis. This meeting should put in place a stability package that includes the developing countries and lays the groundwork for the creation of a new multilateral financial architecture.</p> <p>Over the past five years, GDP per capita in the world's developing economies has been rising faster than in rich countries for the first time in history. According to statistics released by the World Bank last week, the developing world has pulled 232 million people over the global poverty line of $2.50 per day since 1999. </p> <p>These gains in economic growth and poverty alleviation are the result of an economic model that significantly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/14/economy-development\">deviates from the Washington Consensus</a>. Nations like China, India, South Africa and Brazil have all recognised that markets and trade are important for development, but they have also shown the world that markets must be guided by appropriate governmental policy. In the <a href=\"http://www.wto.org/\">World Trade Organisation</a>, where each nation has an equal vote, the developing world has worked hard to preserve the ability to deploy the mix of state and market policies that have been working for them. </p> <p>Until a week ago it was thought that poorer nations were \"de-coupled\" from the current economic crisis because they had piled up reserves and their banks weren't heavily involved in mortgage markets. Now it is clear that the crisis, which was not of their making, is <a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5ib3xv8TuVnwXRBcoVP_rMOSkn12w\">at their doorstep</a>.</p> <p>Much of the economic boom in the developing world was fueled by commodities exports. Demand for exports has declined as prospects of a recession increase, causing a sharp decline in the prices of those exports. Global credit, which is crucial to exporters, has all but frozen. Banks in developing countries weren't heavily involved in the mortgage business, but they did swap with and borrow money from banks in developed countries, creating a credit squeeze for the local economy as well. If that wasn't enough, rising interest rates and credit tightening has strengthened the dollar, and currencies across the developing world are losing value.</p> <p>World leaders should swiftly coordinate interest rate cuts and provide massive liquidity to markets in developing countries. New capital should also come from the larger developing countries, like China, and from the IMF's new short-term liquidity facility.</p> <p>Developing countries can't do this on their own. Many of these nations simply don't have the capital. Some have reserves from the commodity boom but are draining them to save their currencies. What's more, when developing nations unilaterally mimic a rich country's methods of dealing with this crisis by nationalising private assets, such actions can instill even less confidence in a developing country's markets and provoke more capital flight. </p> <p>New capital can be used in the short term to fend off runs on their currencies. Just as important, new credit and capital can be coupled with coordinating governmental policies to build the productive capacities of promising and strategic domestic enterprises and toward domestic consumers to stimulate demand. With jobs becoming scarce and food prices still high, small farmers are also among the strategic sectors worthy of government attention.</p> <p>Non-OECD countries are now half the global economy and more than half the destination of OECD exports. Maintaining the growth in developing countries not only saves them from meltdown but can also help rich countries dig themselves out of a downturn with new demand. </p> <p>Under no circumstances should a developing country's capital infusion have IMF-like conditionalities. Historically, the IMF often gave loans only if recipients deregulated markets, privatised industries, slashed government budgets and devalued currencies. A new book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Development-Redefined-International-Studies-Intensives/dp/1594515239\">Development Redefined: How the Market Met Its Match</a> by Robin Broad and John Cavanagh, documents how IMF conditionality often caused irreversible social and environmental costs on recipient countries and created a global backlash against the IMF and other international institutions. There is simply no legitimate reason for these conditionalities today. Indeed, it was the deregulation in rich countries that helped get us into this economic mess in the first place.</p> <p>Finally, the global summit should be the first step toward a \"<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/23/AR2008102302984.html\">Bretton Woods II</a>\" that supports multilateralism and policy diversity as core principles. This summit must be dedicated to setting counter-cyclical capital standards, regulating all parts of financial markets (including the rating agencies) and creating a credible lender of last resort. Under the current system, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Belgium have more votes in the IMF than China, India and Brazil. A truly multilateral organisation must have a one country-one vote system. Without a new infusion of capital and a multilateral approach to reform, the November meetings will be one step forward, two steps backward.</p>",
  "<p>Activity in Britain's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/manufacturingdata\">manufacturing</a> sector shrank for the sixth month in a row in October, with export orders falling to their lowest level since the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001.</p> <p>The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply said its index of manufacturing activity was 41.5 last month, slightly up from 41.2 in September. This was better than economists' forecast of 40, but still the second weakest reading since the survey began in 1992. Any reading below 50 indicates a slowdown.</p> <p>Roy Ayliffe, director of professional practice at the CIPS, said: \"Conditions for UK manufacturers remained brutal in October, as the turmoil in the world's financial markets showed no signs of abating. </p> <p>\"Purchasing managers in the sector have now reported six consecutive months of decline in production, endorsing industry reports that the UK is now technically in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/recession\">recession</a>.<br>\"While weak domestic demand continued to severely hamper new business prospects, October also saw new export orders slump to levels last seen in the immediate aftermath of 9/11.\"</p> <p>Businesses said lower demand abroad due to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics\">deteriorating economic conditions</a> in the European Union, US and east Asia outweighed any benefit from the weaker pound. October's seasonally adjusted new export orders index was 43.5, the lowest since September 2001.</p> <p>Howard Archer, analyst at IHS Global Insight said: \"The best thing that can be said about the October manufacturing purchasing managers' survey is that it was not quite as dire as feared. </p> <p>\"Nevertheless, this is still an extremely weak survey across the board that does little to dilute fears that the UK could suffer an extended, deep recession.\"</p> <p>Ayliffe said a dramatic easing in price pressures \u2014 with its output prices index falling to 55.6 from 71.8 \u2014 should enable the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor\">Bank of England</a> to make further cuts to interest rates when it meets on Thursday. It cut by 0.5 percentage points last month to 4.5%.</p> <p>Archer said: \"The survey reinforced belief that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/inflation\">inflation</a> is headed sharply down over the coming months, thereby increasing the Bank of England's scope for aggressive interest rate cuts.\"</p>",
  "<h2>Paul Dales at Capital Economics </h2> <p>\"October's UK CIPS/Markit report on manufacturing does little to suggest that the economic downturn will not deepen from here. The rise in the headline PMI from 41.2 in September to 41.5 in October (consensus 40.1) reversed only a very small part of September's fall to a record low. At this level, the survey is pointing to annual growth in manufacturing output of around -8% compared to August's reading of -2%. </p> <p>\"Accordingly, we would be wary of interpreting the rise as a sign that the worst is now behind us. Admittedly, the further fall in the pound over the past month offers some hope. But with the overseas activity environment seemingly weakening by the day, we doubt that this will prevent the manufacturing sector from enduring a deep and long recession. Overall, there's nothing here to prevent the MPC from cutting interest rates aggressively on Thursday. We've gone for a 75bps cut, but it could easily be larger.\"</p> <h2>Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight</h2> <p>\"The best thing that can be said about the October manufacturing purchasing managers' survey is that it was not quite as dire as feared. Nevertheless, this is still an extremely weak survey across the board that does little to dilute fears that the UK could suffer an extended, deep recession.</p> <p>\"The survey shows that activity in the manufacturing sector contracted for a sixth successive month in October and at the second fastest rate after September since the survey started in 1992. Output, new orders, and backlogs of work all contracted sharply again in October, despite rising modestly from September record lows. Employment in manufacturing also continued to contract sharply in October, thereby maintaining fears that unemployment is heading substantially higher over the coming months.\"</p> <h2>James Knightley at ING</h2> <p>\"This is a touch better than the consensus forecast of 40.0, but is still the sixth consecutive month of contraction. Output rose to 42.4 from 41.7 and new orders rose to 37.8 from 36.3. However, export orders fell to the lowest reading since September 2001 despite sterling's plunge. </p> <p>\"Nonetheless, both output and input prices fell sharply, suggesting that the BoE has plenty of room to cut rates. We continue to favour 50bp moves at every meeting between now and March.\" </p> <h2>Alan Clarke at BNP Paribas</h2> <p>\"It's surprisingly robust given all the bad news in October, but that probably reflects the fact that it dropped so much in September. </p> <p>\"It is still very weak indeed, and consistent with a further contraction in the sector. It still supports our view that the Bank of England will cut interest rates this week by more than most people expect.\"</p>",

The following day, Tony Blair was confirmed as Prime Minister. It was a success from the off. Cape had to reprint before publication day due to an unexpectedly high take-up. Reviewers from the Guardian to the Independent to the Telegraph heaped praise on the book and it seemed not impossible that, in the wake of Trainspotting making its mark in cinema, Awaydays, too, might translate to screen.</p> <p><strong>Summer 1998</strong></p> <p>A phone call from my friend Pete Naylor. He and Carl Hunter run a film production company called Domestic Films, which has just made Unlovable, a short film about a Morrissey acolyte. Their executive producer is a young Scot called Angus Lamont, and he's setting up a slate of films with Muriel Grey's Glasgow-based indie, Ideal World. Pete wants to know if the rights to Awaydays are available and, if so, can he bung Angus a copy ? Of course he can.</p> <p>My agent, Norman North, calls a few days later. Gus \u2013 as he shall henceforth be known \u2013 likes the book. He's keen to meet. We have a drink at Ma Egerton's near Liverpool's Lime Street station, and I like him. He's realistic about our chances (slim to zero) but confident he can give Awaydays a good run for his money. Crucially, he wants me to write the script. I offer little resistance. </p> <p>Norman negotiates a fee of \u00a34,000 for the underlying rights in the book, and \u00a310,000 for me to write the script. I'll get \u00a35,000 for the first draft, \u00a32,500 for a set of revisions and a further \u00a32,500 on delivery. Furthermore, should the film be made, I will receive a staggering sum amounting to 2.5 per cent of the film's budget, with a minimum (or 'floor' as it says in the contract) of \u00a340,000, going up to a 'ceiling' of \u00a375,000. I celebrate with my friend Charlie Galloway , the music supervisor behind a lot of great film soundtracks.</p> <p>I tell Charlie I don't care about the money, I just want the film to get made now. Fingers crossed, I pray for a \u00a33m budget.</p> <p>A few weeks later I get a call from Dave Hughes. Yoz is a mate from the Liverpool post-punk scene. He's just finished working on the soundtrack to a film from the up-and-coming producer-director team of Matthew Vaughn and Guy Ritchie. It's called Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. 'Stupid fucking name for a gangster film, that,' I say. 'Is Norman Wisdom in it?' But Yoz reckons it is destined for big things.</p> <p>He's given Matthew Vaughn Awaydays to read and he's keen to discuss a deal. There's a strange gnawing in my guts as I tell Dave the rights have gone. Instinctively I'm relieved that Awaydays won't be at the mercy of a Southern sensibility. But Yoz's aubade has a haunting timbre: 'Pity, that, mate. They're going to be players, these two. They can make pretty well whatever they want\u2026'</p> <p><strong>Spring 1999</strong></p> <p>Uh-oh. Gus has registered for the Robert McKee lecture. McKee is the L Ron Hubbard of screenwriting theory, and those exposed to his teachings emerge beatific converts, unable henceforth to embrace work that fails to conform to McKee's principles-of-story structure. In a previous life I worked for Steve Garrett at Channel 4 (today, Steve's Kudos company makes such high-concept television drama as Life on Mars, SpooksHustle and Echo Beach/Moving Wallpaper).</p> <p>Steve attended the McKee lecture in 1988 and returned, evangelical, handing out precis of the notes he'd taken. I well remember one of the first principles, concerning your film's hero. 'What does your hero want? Why can't he get it?'</p> <p>In our first script meeting after the McKee experience, Gus fixes me with his producer's look and says: 'Carty. What does he really want? And why can't he get it?'</p> <p><strong>Summer 1999</strong></p> <p>I've written a first draft, a second draft and revised versions of both \u2013 all quickly rejected by potential film financiers. The problem is that there are very few serious film funders in the UK. Essentially it's Film 4 (the movie business arm of C4), the BBC and, soon, Blair's new baby, the UK Film Council. Gus just wants to get us into the system and reckons the best way is to apply for script development funding. I sit with Gus through three meetings with script development executives and watch their eyes glaze . One woman says: 'I fail to comprehend why I should care even a jot for these frankly unpleasant creatures.'</p> <p>But Gus doesn't give up on me. He gives me three things. A further \u00a32,500 for a new draft. A piece of software called Final Draft that will format my dense script works into something resembling a screenplay. And he gives me a script editor. Chris Penfold is a revelation . We spend three or four sessions on an old sloop moored at Liverpool Marina giving the script an intensive workout. He just sits , hour after hour, asking me questions: 'And who does Carty relate to more? His mother or his father?' It works. I head into the new draft with a spring in my step and a clear idea of what's needed to make this great rites-of-passage story into equally great cinema.</p> <p><strong>Winter 1999</strong></p> <p>All change at Film 4. Under the tutelage of Paul Webster , they're looking to make bigger-budget films \u2013 but insist there will always be a place for distinctive British projects. Gus sends them the latest draft of our distinctive British project. It's December. Webster's deputy at Film 4, Elinor Day, is keen to discuss the script, before the Christmas break if possible. Gus has already booked a snow boarding holiday and can't make it, but thinks I should still go, solo. </p> <p>Film 4's offices are a minimalist glass-and-steel affair in Charlotte Street. I'm insecure in meetings like this, in places like this. I'm 38, my hair is going white and I know C4 prizes youth above everything. They want mussed-up hair and chunky red spectacles, not my lived-in face and fl at vowels.</p> <p>I'm in such a funk of angry, regionalist resentment that I almost don't care when the receptionist tells me Elinor is on her way down to collect me. I'm a bit disarmed by this. Big cheeses in the film world don't come down to collect their guests. But my terror-fuelled prejudices come coursing back as the lift disgorges a bespectacled, funky-looking student speaking excitedly to a very tall lady. In French. She kisses him on both cheeks, tells him it's been fantastic meeting him and sends him on his way with a Joyeux No\u00ebl. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm thinking \u2013 just piss off back to Paris, you spiky-haired divvy\u2026 Elinor turns to me, and her face lights up. 'My God, Kevin, I'm so sorry! I really couldn't avoid that. Thanks so much for coming in. I just love Awaydays\u2026'</p> <p>She means it . She reckons the script needs a tweak, nothing too drastic. But she's already sent it on to Paul Webster with a rave review. Maybe Awaydays will be the Quadrophenia of the new millennium.</p> <p><strong>2000</strong></p> <p>The joy is short-lived. Not that anything fatal happens, but Film 4 give Gus the go-ahead for another of his films, Late Night Shopping , and that's him out of action for most of the year. I can't shake the feeling that this is going to hurt Awaydays. Not long after the book was published, Mike Hodges sent me a postcard saying how much he'd loved it. I was overjoyed \u2013 maybe, just maybe, the director of Get Carter would want to get involved?</p> <p>Somehow, it never happened. Hodges was going through a terrible time with Film 4 over his new film Croupier and I suspect that Gus was, justifiably, unwilling to jeopardise his hard-won relationship with the UK's only real superpower in the film world. Elinor Day, too, is preoccupied with a major budget adaptation of Sebastian Faulks's novel Charlotte Gray. It feels like Awaydays has gone flat.</p> <p>Gus dispatches me to see Chris Auty at The Film Consortium , which has tons of cash, and Chris is 'a fan of the book'. I'm becoming a little cynical at all these 'fans of the book' . If everyone loves it so much, why is it proving so hard to make? The meeting is a much-needed shot in the arm, though. Chris genuinely does 'get' Awaydays. He's a Northerner, a very amusing raconteur and reckons Awaydays is the first novel ever to mention Joy Division. And just as I'm allowing myself to get excited, he follows up with the hammer blow: 'I'm fascinated by Factory Records. Aren't you? I'd love to do omething about Factory. Don't you think that'd be great? If I don't do your film I'll definitely do Factory.' It was to be our first and last meeting. A couple of years on, 24 Hour Party People comes out. It remains one of my favourite films, ever.</p> <p><strong>2001</strong></p> <p>Late Night Shopping wins a prize at the Berlin Film Festival. Gus is cock-a-hoop. With Film 4 and others now clamouring for his next projects, he sets us up with Pat Harkins , a young Scottish director who has just completed his first movie, The Final Curtain. Hallelujah! We have a director attached. Alan Yentob calls Gus. Yentob is a legendary arts producer and programmer at the BBC with a seemingly free remit . He spends his life being courted by aspiring programme-makers and very rarely feels the urge or the need to call people. But Gus is going to Yentob's house for dinner. We agree that this can only mean one thing. He wants Awaydays. Gus recounts the evening with typical bleak humour. He and Yentob discussed everything from lottery funding to the spiralling budget for the new Opera House. They drank several bottles of exceptionally good wine. After three hours and four or five bottles, Gus found himself saying: 'So\u2026Awaydays?' Yentob had never heard of it. Bemused, Gus gently inquired as to the purpose of the evening.</p> <p>'I have you on my radar,' said Yentob. </p> <p>Late Night Shopping bombs in the UK. The clamour for Gus's next winner recedes. But it's not all bad. Film 4 have unveiled The Lab, a hothouse for low-budget, experimental and regional film. It will be headed by Robin Gutch. Robin is a fan of the book. I get to work on a new draft of the script.</p> <p>Gus reckons this new draft is very nearly there but wants my blessing to bring in a new writer. It takes half a minute or so for me to process what<br>he's saying here. I think I'm being sacked. Gus is quick to reassure me. It's not going to be a rewrite. More of a trim from a 'safe pair of hands' who can take a dispassionate look and help carve out the film we all know this can be. </p> <p>The writer's name is Rob Fraser , an experienced TV writer. After all the support I've had from Gus and Glasgow production company Ideal World, I owe them a bit of grace. I summon up every last spark of wit and good humour I can dredge from my soul, and try to squeeze some enthusiasm into my voice. In December, Rob's script comes through. It's a complete rewrite.</p> <p><strong>2002</strong></p> <p>In what will be Gus's last throw of the dice, he commissions the Manchester-based casting agent Michael Jackson to workshop Rob 's version of the script. Until now I have been almost saintly in my praise for Rob's redraft. I badly want to help Gus get Awaydays made. But seeing it play out now in front of my very eyes is more than I can bear. It's like sitting there, a set smile on your face as you thumbs-up the man ravishing your wife. These characters are not my Pack. Carty is not Carty. I stumble out, and don't come back.</p> <p><strong>2003</strong></p> <p>'The film should be 77 minutes long. We'll just go punk on it. Do everything ourselves\u2026 it'll be brilliant!' The rights in Awaydays have reverted back to me. Ideal World have given the film a brave go, but they're cutting back. They won't be renewing their option. Gus is executive producer of a new<br>Robbie Coltrane drama on ITV, The Plan man. I think we parted on good terms, but I'm relieved that the last version of Awaydays didn't see the<br>light of day. </p> <p>I've come to realise that I'm emotionally attached to Awaydays in a way that is almost unhealthy. I will never hand over control again. 'We should do it like Zoo Records, or Factory. Take control of all the creative decisions, everything\u2026' I'm in The Ship &amp; Mitre in Liverpool's Dale Street , talking to Dave Hughes. I've just hosted a war council for anyone and everyone who has ever shown an interest in Awaydays, telling them the film is getting made, come what may. Present are Ian Lysaght and Dave Cotterill, who will go on to make excellent films of their own. Alex Cox pops in and offers encouragement, too. Alex is a fan of the book.</p> <p>But once the party breaks up, Yoz tells me that if I can rewrite the script with a minimal cast and an eye on a micro-budget of around \u00a3300,000 (\u00a33m is considered 'low-budget' in the UK), he's confident he can do something . He's formed a company with an experienced producer called Peter La Terriere. Their plan is to take advantage of revolutions in digital (ie cheap) movie-making, along with tax incentives for investors in film.</p> <p>I am now consumed by the idea of seeing Awaydays on the silver screen. I've long since realised there'll be no big payday, no \u00a375,000 ceilings. But fuck that, I'm convinced that audiences will love this film and here's one last chance to prove it. I start from scratch. New era, brand new script. I take a deep, deep breath and ask myself: 'What does Carty really want? Why can't he have it?' </p> <p>The resulting screenplay is a lean, mean 78 pages. It's the best version yet \u2013 taut and punchy, but poetic too, I think. It's beautiful. Yoz and Peter L a Terriere agree. Just a case of finding the money then.</p> <p><strong>2004</strong></p> <p>Peter receives an offer he'd be mad to refuse (the UK producer's role on the long-awaited Terence Malick picture The New World ). Yoz receives notice that Parr Street Studios , where he's based, is to be sold to property developers. In the wake of Liverpool being announced as European Capital of Culture 2008, the city centre has been invaded by cranes and scaffolding. </p> <p>Our little cultural enterprise will have to find a new home. Chris Moll joins North West Vision, the local outpost of the UK Film Council, charged with<br>identifying, supporting and providing business structure for the North West's talent. I've applied to them a few times for script development support on Awaydays but invariably been dejected by the response.</p> <p>I warn Dave that the moment NWV know it's Awaydays the curtains will come down. But Moll arrives with a good reputation and Yoz has a cunning plan. His strategy is to apply for business and infrastructure funding. He has a long-standing partnership with a Liverpool-supporting, chain-smoking, serial-swearing techno-boffin whizzkid called Dave Harry. Where computers and cameras and technology are concerned, Dave can build or fix anything. </p> <p>Yoz wants to build a micro-studio from scratch. More than half a film's budget is spent on post-production costs, but if we own that equipment\u2026 </p> <p>The decision will rest on the viability of Yoz's business plan. Editorial concerns will not come into it. </p> <p><strong>2005</strong></p> <p>I'm barefoot on what passes for a lawn in our postage-stamp garden, sipping tea. I'm supposed to be trimming the overgrown borders with an electric hedge trimmer. I took my training shoes off to go indoors and make myself a cuppa, and was too lazy to put the mug down and put my shoes back on. A moment ago, I skinned the plastic coating on the trimmer's long orange lead, and the stupid thing is, I know I've exposed live wires. I got a tiny little shock just before, and I've just seen a wasp explode. But I'm daydreaming as I take up a load of slack so that I can move on and tackle a new patch. </p> <p>I grasp the live wire in my hand. The flesh of my palm starts to smoulder immediately. The current jolts through me and I become a part of the electric circuit. I can't drop the trimmer \u2013 I'm magnetically welded to it. I can't control it either. I try to keep my head out of its way as it lurches up and down, steel teeth churning. I scream and scream but know no one can hear me. It occurs to me that I am going to die. With no shoes to earth the current, I'm going to frazzle to death. I start to accept it, and begin to wonder what, technically, will cause my death. Heart attack? Burns? I can<br>smell my flesh melting, and I'm going weak and can't even hold the trimmer off. </p> <p>It's chopping at me and all I can do is keep my head craned out of its way. It chops at my shoulder, chops at my collar bone, chops and chops and I pass out. I'm unsure, still, how I survived the accident. I came to, vomiting, on the grass. There was a man standing over me, but I could never describe him. <br>He must have called an ambulance. The paramedics said it was a miracle I was alive.</p> <p>Reconstructive surgery, rehabilitation, physiotherapy and very, very strong painkillers mean I cannot work for the remainder of the year. I've paid my taxes and NIC for ever, but find I'm ineligible for any kind of unemployment or incapacity benefits. Debt closes in on me. But I realise that I can't face death again without getting this one thing out of the way. I have to see Awaydays made.<br><strong><br>2006</strong></p> <p>Having transmitted this vision to Yoz as my New Year's resolution, he and I set about formalising the company. We're both in tune as to the guiding principles of this bold new entity. Its model will be the great independent record companies of the Seventies \u2013 Zoo, Fast Product , Factory. Our driving force is that we shall not be at the mercy of the institutional development process that, we believe, is suffocating the talent flow in British film. We bandy names about and, in a bolshie mindset, decide on Red Union.</p> <p>Shooting commences on Control. In my current state of mind, now so far adrift financially that I've taken debt counselling , it's hard not to feel a pang of hurt. T he world had forgotten about Joy Division until Awaydays was published. I was on to this stuff way before all these London media ponces.</p> <p>But that's how martyrs think \u2013 and I'm not ready to fall on my sword. Yoz has found a haunted, disused pub overlooking the Mersey that fits his needs. He and Dave Harry can move into the upper floor immediately, then kit out the lower floors with editing and duplicating gear as and when funding arrives. After months of filling in forms , we have made it to the panel stage of North West Vision's funding process. </p> <p>The received wisdom is that if they call you in, you'll get something. Dave, Dave and I arrive at their loft-style offices in the former Mantuna Tea Factory. We're relaxed \u2013 until we're taken through to the panel. There are 12 people round the table. Some never speak and it's all over before it's even begun. They tell us that (a) they really like us, (b) they really, really want to support Red Union but (c) they don't like Awaydays. Sorry. Editorial concerns have, after all, come into it. A detailed script report will follow in the post. It does. It's insulting in its generality and subjectivity. But rejection is perhaps the most powerful creative motor known to man.</p> <p>What started as a vague desire to make a good film out of a good book has become a mission to prove The Industry wrong. It's become a class war.</p> <p><strong>January 2007</strong> </p> <p>Yoz has been analysing the latest version of the government's enterprise investment scheme. An EIS encourages persons of high net worth to invest in small business enterprises. If the business qualifies , there's a tax incentive for the investor that makes their gamble pretty attractive. Red Union qualifies. It's going to be another slog, with most of the onus on Dave as the producer. But he engages the services of Malthouse , a much respected firm of chartered accountants, to set up the fund.<br><strong><br>July 2007</strong></p> <p>We have \u00a3400,000 in the EIS fund. Terrifyingly, we can press the magic button marked ' green light'. Soberingly, we have neither a cast nor a director.</p> <p>Since composing the soundtrack for The Long Weekend, Yoz has had his eye on Pat Holden , the director. We meet him in the garden of our local coffee shop and spend the afternoon giggling over near-misses and catastrophes in the film business. He seems to have an intuitive feel for the heartbeat of Awaydays \u2013 Carty and Elvis's search for meaning in their young lives. We've found our director. </p> <p>These are halcyon days. We don't fully realise it , but Yoz and I are film producers. We're doing the things and making the decisions producers do. And our biggest decision is whether to go hell for leather and make this film before the year is out or wait until spring and do things properly. No contest, then. Having waited 10 years , it's going to take a powerful argument to hold us back.</p> <p>But we agree to let fate decide. We call revered casting director Michelle Smith . Michelle has just cast This is England and clearly has a knack for unearthing young, untried acting talent. If she can find us a Carty and an Elvis, we make the film. If the search has to go on indefinitely, that's fine<br>too. But there has to be alchemy between Carty and Elvis. There has to be magic. The moment Nicky Bell walks into the casting suite we're hypnotised . He's a cocky little rascal, but vulnerable, too. He's Carty. It's now a case of<br>finding the perfect foil . Elvis has to be sexy, arrogant, romantic, poetic, violent\u2026 not much to ask for in a young, untried actor. Part of the Red Union<br>philosophy is that we're keen to foster unknown talent. Just as Quadrophenia launched a dozenyoung actors, we want Awaydays to showcase a brand new Rat Pack \u2013 the Pack Pack. </p> <p>We're smitten by the performances of Alfie Allen, Oliver Lee, Christian Cook \u2013 but Liam Boyle makes Elvis all his own. He's one of these kids that the camera just laps up and the chemistry between him and Nicky is enchanted. It's an indescribably emotional moment, coming out of the final casting into an electric storm that tears the sky into strips, knowing that this is it. No turning back now.</p> <p>Awaydays will be released on 5 March 2009</p> <h2>Musical Youth - British Teenage Tribes on the Big Screen</h2> <p><strong>Teddy Boys 1950s</strong></p> <p>Credited for bringing fashion to the postwar male consciousness, teddy boys sported clothes infl uenced by both Edwardian England and contemporary America \u2013 loose-collared white shirts with skinny ties and a brocade waistcoat, high-waisted trousers in a drainpipe cut and suede 'brothel creeper' shoes. Musically, meanwhile, they listened to early rock'n'roll by acts such as Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis. As seen in: The Damned (Joseph Losey, 1963) <br><strong><br>Rockers, 1950s/1960s</strong>.</p> <p>As the teddy boy subculture faded, it split into two distinct factions that formed their own subcultures: mods and rockers. Also known as greasers, rockers were infl uenced by American film and music and were synonymous with motorbikes. Their style was practical as much as it was fashionable \u2013 leather motorcycle jackets, aviator sunglasses, Levi's jeans and slicked-back hair \u2013 while Chuck Berry, Eddie Cochran and Bo Diddley soundtracked their lives. As seen in The Wild One (Laslo Benedek, 1953)</p> <p><strong>Mods, 1960s</strong></p> <p>Mods were also a rejection of mainstream British pop culture. Stemming from the material wealth of postwar working-class Britain, mods were characterised by Vespa scooters, expensive, tailored suits, button-pin badges and the Union Jack and RAF roundel symbol. Keen to be on the cutting edge, they listened to whatever was new, from African-American soul music to Jamaican ska, and frequented London's all-night nightclubs the Scene, the Flamingo and the Marquee. As seen in Quadrophenia (Franc Roddam, 1979)<br><strong><br>Skinheads, 1970s</strong></p> <p>The harder mods soon merged into the early skinheads, at first a nonpolitical subculture that mixed with Jamaican rudeboys and danced at West Indian clubs. Later, skinheads became increasingly associated with racism and extreme right-wing politics. Eventually skins swapped ska for oi!, a thuggish strain of punk, although their main interest was football, to which they wore Ben Sherman shirts, braces and heavy workboots. As seen in This is England (Shane Meadows, 2006)</p> <p><strong>Casuals, 1980s</strong><br>Heavily influenced by the skinhead subculture before them and the late-Seventies mod revival, casuals were noted for their participation in football hooliganism and fondness for designer clothing. The expensive<br>labels helped them escape the attention of the police and infiltrate the pubs of rival football teams on match days. Their musical tastes were eclectic, but<br>casuals are associated with acid house, techno and the Madchester and Britpop movements. As seen in The Business (Nick Love, 2005)</p>",

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/panasonic\">Panasonic</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business+world/japan\">Japanese</a> electronics firm, is poised to launch a bid for rival Sanyo in a deal that would see the formation of the country's biggest electronics maker. Panasonic will announce its plans later this week, according to media reports, and begin negotiations with Sanyo's three major shareholders, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/goldmansachs\">Goldman Sachs</a>, Daiwa Securities SMBC and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group. They aim to complete the deal by April next year.</p> <p>Together, the two electronics firms would have revenues of \u00a511.29tn (\u00a370bn) based on forecasts for the current financial year, higher than the \u00a510.9tn forecast by Hitachi, Japan's biggest electronics maker in terms of sales. Under the agreement, Panasonic would buy nearly 430m preferred shares in Sanyo, each of which can be exchanged for 10 common shares, giving it a 70% stake in the company worth about \u00a5620bn.</p> <p>Reports said today that the presidents of Panasonic, the world's biggest maker of plasma TVs, and Sanyo, the global leader in rechargeable batteries, had agreed in principle that Sanyo would become a subsidiary.</p> <p>The tie-up would strengthen Panasonic's position in the expanding global market for lithium-ion batteries and put it in direct competition with Sony for contracts with makers of electric and hybrid cars. It would also have access to Sanyo's expertise in solar power cells, while its smaller rival would be able to take advantage of Panasonic's huge customer base.</p> <p>Sanyo was forced to issue \u00a5300bn in preferred shares in 2006 to Goldman and the two Japanese banks after a fall in earnings, blamed in part on earthquake damage to its microchip plant. </p> <p>Panasonic's ambitious plans for global expansion have been boosted by the financial crisis and recent plunges in Japanese stocks. Its interest in Sanyo is rumoured to have intensified as it watched shares in the struggling firm sink by almost a third over the past two months. It may eventually attempt to acquire all of Sanyo's shares and make it a wholly owned subsidiary, reports said.</p> <p>The for-cash sale would also help Goldman Sachs as it attempts to reassure creditors and stabilise its balance sheets. Sumitomo Mitsui, too, is in the hunt for revenue after lowering its profit forecast for this fiscal year by 63% last week.</p> <p>Sanyo registered net profit in March for the first time in four years after its new president Seiichiro Sano \u2013 the first to have been appointed from outside the founding family in the firm's 60-year history \u2013 targeted growth areas such as rechargeable batteries and solar panels. But it has struggled in the face of competition from more than ten other electronics firms, including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/sony\">Sony</a> and industrial conglomerates such as Hitachi and Toshiba.</p> <p>Panasonic sources were quoted as saying that the jobs of Sanyo's 100,000 employees would be safe.</p>",
  "<p>Nothing has highlighted the fragmentation of the left and our inability to intervene collectively and effectively as much as the current economic crisis. There's an eerie silence as the global financial world crumbles and \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/31/banking-royalbankofscotlandgroup\">nationalisation</a>\" just happens. Some say that what is emerging is \"socialism for the bosses\", not the people who have paid the real price. The final settlement is yet to emerge, but the extent to which need not greed is at the heart of bail-outs with hitherto unavailable and unimaginable quantities of public cash, will tell us whether New Labour is changing tack. </p> <p>The left \u2013 and truly progressive forces in all their many guises \u2013 should not wait to find out. Whatever the outcome of the credit crunch rescue mission or the next general election, the social fault lines have been there for all to see since 1997 and beyond. But the left has increasingly failed to find popular yet forceful means of articulating the fall-out from turbo-capitalism and discrimination, let alone organising to make governments act or power shift towards the people. Whatever the roots of the left's inertia \u2013 be it the disillusion with New Labour, middle age or our recent inability to stop the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/09/georgebush.usforeignpolicy\">war in Iraq</a> \u2013 our self-belief is surely shaken. But now is not the moment to give in. </p> <p>The real spectres haunting the earth are clear for all to see: there's still grinding poverty for many. The obsession with markets and failure to understand the importance of public services for collective wellbeing and a sense of belonging, has led to costly, alienating and ineffective mass privatisation. There's disrespect for many public sector workers, mostly low-paid women. Social care services are under-funded and rationed as the need for them grows. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/28/recession-pension-decline-money\">Pensions are disappearing</a>, race and gender discrimination remain breathtakingly evident in the gender pay gap and unemployment patterns. Migrant workers face new threats, the BNP and fascism are on the rise and 5 million people in England alone languish on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/oct/29/social-housing-statistics\">housing waiting lists</a>. That's not to mention the threats facing the planet and the desperate need for international solidarity.</p> <p>These are all issues which the left and civil society organisations together must find new and effective ways to organise and mobilise around. We need strong but flexible coalitions that break with the sectarianism of the past and name, shame and campaign. Organisations as diverse as <a href=\"http://www.londoncitizens.org.uk/\">London Citizens</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/\">Fawcett Society</a>, <a href=\"http://www.compassonline.org.uk/\">Compass</a>, <a href=\"http://www.searchlightmagazine.com/\">Searchlight</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cpag.org.uk/\">CPAG</a>, <a href=\"http://www.foe.co.uk/\">Friends of the Earth</a>, <a href=\"http://www.philosophyfootball.com/\">Philosophy Football</a>, <a href=\"http://www.shelter.org.uk/\">Shelter</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.wdm.org.uk/\">World Development Movement</a> and <a href=\"http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/\">Liberty</a> will all be vital to new forms of sustainable campaigning. </p> <p>But trade unions and the TUC with members and money need to broaden their horizons, initiate and provide long-term support to coalitions on the big issues and give access to workers' organisations across the world. Academics must share their knowledge more freely, working within these coalitions, as well as talking to each other and the already converted. Radical journals should engage with real struggles, as well as develop theory. </p> <p>The left has much to learn from organisations like London Citizens whose winning campaigns are led by those who face poverty and injustice themselves and are rooted in painstaking organising involving established community and faith groups. From time to time we could also ask ourselves Brecht's questions from The Doubter: \"Who are you? To whom do you speak? Who finds what you say useful? Is it also linked to what's already there? How does one act if one believes what you say? Above all; how does one act?\" We might learn a thing or two.</p> <p><em>\"After New Labour\", the second debate in the \"Who owns the progressive future?\" series, organised by Comment is free and <a href=\"http://www.soundings.org.uk/\">Soundings journal</a>, will take place in London at <a href=\"http://www.kingsplace.co.uk/\">Kings Place</a> tonight at 7pm.

  "<p>During this coming month everyone over 60 will find an extra \u00a3200 in their bank account. Without much fanfare the <a href=\" http://www.thepensionservice.gov.uk/winterfuel/ \"> winter fuel payment</a> has arrived. </p> <p>To many recipients of this payment the money is vital, to some it is useful and to a minority it is good to have, but in no way essential. In fact last year I remember hearing a friend remark that the winter fuel allowance had arrived and he was off to buy a case of \"winter warming\" champagne!</p> <p>It seems strange, when there is still an unacceptable level of child poverty in Britain and so many old people are living in straitened circumstances, that the government is unable to set up a scheme to enable and encourage the better off to make a gesture which will benefit the neediest.</p> <p>In the absence of a government scheme this is something that a theatre - so often a central part of the community - can easily do. This week the <a href=\" http://www.tricycle.co.uk/htmlnew/index.php\">Tricycle</a>, together with <a href=\"http://www.brentcab.co.uk/\">Brent Citizens' Advice Bureau</a>, is launching a <a href=\"http://www.tricycle.co.uk/htmlnew/winter/\">winter warmth campaign</a>. We are asking our more well-heeled (and better centrally heated) older audience to spread a little happiness at the time of Diwali, Hannukah and Christmas to those to whom this money will make real difference.</p> <p>Why the theatre? Well, each year we, like many other theatres, work with 12,000 socially excluded children many of whom come from families in our local area. To these families the enormous rise in energy bills is a cause of real hardship. Our \"pay what you can\" scheme on Tuesdays and Saturday matinees ensures that a prosperous older audience often rubs shoulders with those facing real need to enjoy a play that has common interest.</p> <p>Theatre can and should be the centre of its community - at its best it should tackle issues that concern all of society. The scourge of abject poverty, cold flats and homes are issues that should matter to us all.</p> <p>The theatre, by leading a campaign like this can ensure it gets a high profile: Joanna Lumley has kindly offered to be patron of this scheme and to lead by example. The beauty of this is that her \u00a3200 donation will (courtesy of the government's <a href=\"http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/MoneyTaxAndBenefits/ManagingMoney/GivingMoneyToCharity/DG_10015097\">gift aid scheme</a>) immediately becomes \u00a3256 when it is received by Brent CAB. They have promised, with no administration charge, to immediately pass it on to the neediest families in our community.</p> <p>How about a national campaign?</p>",
  "<p>So much for Bono's bird's-eye view. The vaunted <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/u2\">U2</a> Tower \u2013 a massive development planned for the Dublin docklands \u2013 was shelved on Friday, as Ireland slumps further into recession.</p> <p>After six years of negotiation and three rounds of architectural competition, the Dublin Docklands Development Authority (DDDA) has set aside these plans, blaming the city's dwindling housing market and Ireland's general economic malaise. </p> <p>The 200m euro (\u00a3160m) development would have been the first skyscraper in Ireland \u2013 and the country's tallest building. It would also have been Ireland's tallest recording studio, with an egg-shaped studio \"pod\" at the top of a 120-metre column.</p> <p>Though the DDDA said that it remains committed to the Tower, the downturn in Ireland's property market has made the situation perilous. Some 20,000 new Irish residences remain unsold, according to the Associated Press, and earlier this year Ireland became the first euro country to enter a recession. Developers had meanwhile planned to sell more than 180 of the Tower's riverside apartments, each for at least 1m euros. </p> <p>\"The objective is to see this landmark project completed. However, given the current unfavourable economic environment, more time is needed at this juncture,\" the DDDA said in a statement. It plans to re-open developer negotiations within 12 months and is \"confident that these economic uncertainties are short to medium-term\". </p> <p>Norman Foster's swish design calls for a building at least twice as tall as any other building in Dublin, with room for riverside traffic to pass through its base. Besides the sky-high recording studio, the roof would also feature wind turbines and solar panelling \u2013 while two sides of the Tower would be coated to look like fish scales. Dubliners may have already been debating whether to call it the \"giant haddock\", \"big cod\" or \"posh tilapia\".</p> <p>All four of U2's members \u2013 as well as manager Paul McGuinness \u2013 had a stake in the project. U2 signed on after being tossed from their docklands studio six years ago. The Associated Press reports that this agreement has now been set aside.</p> <p>Work on the tower was originally intended to begin this year, with a completion date in 2011.<br></p>",
  "<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/barclay\">Barclays</a></strong> is leading the FTSE 100 fallers after analysts cut their price targets following Friday's news of a \u00a37.3bn cash injection giving Middle East investors a 30% stake. The Abu Dhabi owner of Manchester City football club will become the bank's biggest single investor.</p> <p>The news sent Barclays' shares down 12% on Friday because of the heavy dilution of existing investors, and the slide has continued today. It is down 13.2p at 165.7p, a decline of more than 7%. </p> <p>Merrill Lynch has cut its price target from 235p to 204p, while UBS has reduced its estimate from 220p to 170p to reflect the higher number of shares in issue.<br></p> <p>UBS said: \"Barclays is not an expensive stock. However, expected return on equity is below cost of equity and the price/earnings ratio of 8.1x 2009 estimate profit is at a premium to peers. We also continue to expect substantial sector-wide negative earnings revisions from the UK cyclical downturn. As a <br>consequence, we retain a neutral rating on the shares.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile Panmure Gordon, in a sell note, said: \"Of course, it is a good thing that Barclays has boosted its capital ratios; it is just the cost of it that concerns us. And at first glance, the interim management statement [on Friday] seems to show additional deterioration in credit quality in some key areas (CLOs, CMBS) along with further deterioration in credit ratings of some counterparties (eg monolines).\"</p> <p>Still in the banking sector, <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/hbos\">HBOS</a></strong> has climbed 3p to 102.3p. The bank has raised its bad debt estimate to \u00a35.2bn, in line with estimates, and there is also vague talk of a counter bid to the agreed <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/lloydstsbgroup\">Lloyds TSB</a></strong> offer. Lloyds, down 2.7p to 195.1p, has warned of a sharp fall in profits due to rising bad debts and the current financial turmoil.</p> <p>Alex Potter at Collins Stewart said there was little unexpected in the HBOS statement and its shares were a cheap way into Lloyds. He said: \"Capital has not been impaired beyond our expectations today. Therefore the Lloyds bid appears likely to go through (contingent on Lloyds' EGM on 19 November.) HBOS is at a discount of around 20% to the bid and we see that gap closing.\"</p> <p>Overall we can expect another volatile week, awaiting the US election results and the UK interest rate decision, with some hoping for a full 100 basis point cut from the Bank of England. Some turnaround that would be, if it happened, given the Bank's reluctance to move until the recent global co-ordinated cut.</p> <p>At the moment the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> is continuing its upward trend, 19.33 points higher at 4396.67.</p> <p>Miners continue to make much of the running, with<strong> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/kazakhmys\">Kazakhmys</a></strong> up 29p at 314.5p and <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/xstrata\">Xstrata</a></strong> 84p better at \u00a311.39.</p> <p>The <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/londonstockexchangegroup\">London Stock Exchange</a></strong> has climbed 36.5p to 595p.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/europeanbanks\">Commerzbank, Germany's second-largest bank</a>, today said it would accept a \u20ac8.2bn (\u00a36.44bn) capital injection from the state and a further \u20ac15bn in guaranteed funding. </p> <p>Commerz, which is taking over Dresdner, its smaller rival, said it had agreed to pay no dividends for the next two years. It will also scrap all boardroom bonuses in 2009 and 2010 and cap its chief executive's salary at \u20ac500,000.</p> <p>The bank made its moves as it reported a net loss of \u20ac285m in the third quarter when it was heavily exposed to both <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/lehmanbrothers\">Lehman Brothers</a>, the bankrupt US investment bank, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business+world/iceland\">Iceland, the virtually insolvent country</a>. </p> <p>It said it made a combined operating loss of almost \u20ac900m through these two events. In the first nine months its pre-tax earnings of \u20ac2.3bn a year ago shrank to \u20ac419m.</p> <p>Germany's private sector banks have been under considerable pressure from chancellor Angela Merkel to join her government's \u20ac500bn stabilisation package, with the biggest, Deutsche, creating a storm by saying it would be \"ashamed\" to take part.</p> <p>Martin Blessing, Commerz chief executive, said today: \"We have decided to make use of the package because this is good for the bank, its employees and its clients. As a result, Commerzbank further enhances its competitiveness.\"</p> <p>Its decision raises its Tier 1 capital ratio closer to 9%, still well below the benchmark level of 13.7% set by Swiss bank Credit Suisse - or the 11.2% reported separately today by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, the French bank.</p> <p>SocGen, stung earlier this year by a \u20ac4.9bn loss because of alleged rogue trader Jerome Kerviel, is taking a \u20ac1.7bn injection from the French state in return for agreeing to increase its lending by 4%<br>a year.</p> <p>It said its net earnings declined 84% to \u20ac183m in the quarter, with operating income down 59% from \u20ac1.78bn to just \u20ac724m, as the global banking crisis peaked in September.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's biggest home lender HBOS raised its hit from the value of risky assets and bad loans to over \u00a35bn pounds on Monday and its takeover partner Lloyds TSB warned of a sharp fall in profits.</p> <p>The banks said the takeover of HBOS by Lloyds TSB remained on track, however, and Lloyds said it expects to resume dividend payments next year after repaying preference shares taken by the UK government.</p> <p>Lloyds also raised its expected cost savings from the deal to \u00a31.5bn a year from \u00a31bn.</p> <p>By 8am GMT Lloyds shares were up 4.7% at 207p, valuing its offer at 125p per HBOS share. HBOS shares jumped 9% to 108p, also helped by a weekend report of a potential counterbid.</p> <p>Both banks said market conditions remain tough.</p> <p>HBOS said writedowns and losses on bad debts for the first nine months of this year had risen to \u00a35.2bn, up \u00a32.7bn in the third quarter.</p> <p>The owner of the Halifax said losses on structured credit related assets was \u00a31.8bn at the end of September, up from \u00a31.1bn at the end of June.</p> <p>Bad debt losses in its retail bank rose to \u00a31.2bn pounds and more than trebled in its corporate banking arm to \u00a31.7bn by the end of September.</p> <p>Lloyds said its profit for the first nine months of the year also fell sharply as a result of financial market turmoil and rising bad debts.</p> <p>The bank said it expected to write off a further \u00a3300m in the second half of this year as a result of an increase in bad loans to businesses, and predicted a further \u00a3120m impairment charge as a result of falling house prices.</p> <p>The bank published a circular to shareholders confirming its offer of 0.605 Lloyds shares for every HBOS share.</p> <p>Lloyds stepped in to buy HBOS in a government-brokered deal, after HBOS was hit by a deepening global financial crisis and concerns about its exposure to the weakening UK housing market.</p> <p>Both banks were forced to recapitalise under the government's rescue plan, taking a combined \u00a317bn from the sale of preference shares to the UK government and from the issue of equity guaranteed by the state.</p> <p>There have been concerns that investors will not receive a dividend for several years until preference shares sold to the government had been repaid.</p> <p>Lloyds Chairman Victor Blank said in his letter to shareholders the bank intends to repay the preference shares \"during 2009 so that the block on the payment of cash ordinary dividends will be removed.\"</p>",
  "<p>Campaigning for Barack Obama in the still warm and sunny battle-ground of Virginia, what lessons are there for British politics in this historic election?</p> <p>1) First, find your Tony Blair. Watching Obama give a long <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/30/rachel-maddow-interviews_n_139402.html\">interview to Rachel Maddow</a>, a woman who the BBC could hire tomorrow to show how political talk shows can be interesting and fun, I was struck by his uncanny resemblance to Blair. It was time to get past tit-for-tat politics, said Obama. Capitalism was OK. The Republican party had many fine people in it, the Democratic candidate declared. Obama is as devout a Christian as he is devoted family man. Welcome to Barack Blair!</p> <p>2) Speak well. The old rules of rhetoric never go away. Obama is a terrific public orator. Every time he stands at a podium, still, slim and in control of his body as he speaks without notes in short, effective sentences he exudes command and control. By contrast, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/01/davidcameron.toryconference1\">David Cameron's conference speech</a> this year was as interesting as John McCain's Tory conference speech in 2007.</p> <p>3) If you are a Conservative, be one. McCain is tarred with being the continuation of Bush-Cheney years by other means. In fact, he opposed much of the Bush ideology over the years. His latest TV advert shows Obama praising McCain for initiating environmental legislation in the Senate. This makes Obama look good but dismays American rightwing voters who don't like to see their man hugging the enemy close.</p> <p>4) Gear up for door-to-door canvassing. Spending time with Democrats gives the lie to the view that American elections are all about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/30/uselections2008-barackobama-4m-30-minute-infomercial\">big money and TV campaigning</a>. They are but the intensity of phone canvassing and door knocking is greater than I have ever seen in the UK outside byelections. Canvassers have handheld personal data machines that allow instant transfers of voters' intentions and interests. As I write friends are taking leave from work to drive hours to North Carolina to get out the vote in a state where Obama and McCain are neck and neck.</p> <p>5) Hit greed but love business. Obama lashes Wall Street but talks up Main Street. Small businesses are the new working unrich in America. The Tories chez nous are now the party of the super-wealthy as the millionaires' frontbench presided over by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/27/osborne-tories-deripaska-mandelson\">Oligarch Osborne</a> and super-rich Cameron demonstrate. But Labour can come dangerously close to being anti-business especially in the rhetoric from those looking to a post-election leadership fight.</p> <p>6) Be tough on international issues. Obama wants to <a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jnI2PmONXtYeD7lMyxUPK4Y5gEGg\">increase troop commitments</a> in Afghanistan and has taken India to task over <a href=\"http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/News/PoliticsNation/Obamas_remark_on_solving_Kashmir_dispute_welcome/articleshow/3664967.cms\">Kashmir</a> where nearly a million Indian and Pakistani soldiers face off against each other, instead of the latter being transferred to Pakistan's western borders to help uproot Islamist jihadists seeking to reconquer Afghanistan to close down every girls' school. His vice-presidential running mate, Joe Biden, is friend and supporter of Georgia's Mikheil Saakashvili in contrast to Tory footsying around with Russian money or Tories on the Council of Europe collaborating with Kremlin puppets. Obama wants to work with Europe as a whole, not deal one by one with EU member states rejecting European unity as in the Hague-Cameron vision of Europe. His promise of an undivided Jerusalem as the eternal capital of Israel is a further example of a foreign affairs approach that his mixed-message language on Iraq should not occult.</p> <p>7) Don't invite losers to speak at your party conference. Cameron cosied up to McCain who has been the only major international speaker at the Tory conference since Cameron became leader. At least one Tory shadow cabinet member has been spotted sitting with Republicans at the McCain-Obama debates. While some Tory MPs keep Obama buttons in their pockets and I came across a Tory activist working for Obama, the Cameron-McCain link is another example of Cameron's shallow judgment on international politics.</p> <p>8) Talks about individuals not just families. Obama has dropped the tired Clinton line about hard-working families and now talks of hard-working Americans. This is right. In Britain, 30% of households are not family units. They are single people, widows, the divorced, parents alone. Tax policy now has to focus on the individual as much as the family.</p> <p>9) Don't promise too much. Obama is riding two waves. One is the deep sense of despair mixed with shame that the Bush-Cheney years have done so little for America at home and abroad. The second is a deeper tide-of-history movement that is bringing to an end the long 30-year era of global market capitalism which begun with the arrival of Thatcher and Reagan just as they ended the 30-year era of welfare state capitalism initiated after 1945. Americans hope Obama will be the new Roosevelt. He may be a new Carter. But underneath the rhetoric of change, Obama is centrist, cautious and careful in limiting specific pledges. But he is offering a tax cut to all middle- and working-class Americans.</p> <p>10) Don't fall for populism. Obama exudes thought and intellect. He can speak clearly and vividly. He acknowledges differences and seeks to bridge them, not use the culture and other wars throbbing in American civil society as a vehicle for partisan point-scoring. The arrival of 50 million non-Americans in the last 15 years as legal or illegal migrants has provoked political storms across the red (Republican)-blue (Democrat) divide. In Britain there is a loser-takes-all auction between politicians on immigration. Obama refuses to play that populist card and British politics could learn from him.</p>",

Instead, its affluent students are regular targets for attack and attempted kidnappings in an increasingly unstable Kabul. Some now believe foreign forces should leave and the Taliban come back into government.</p> <p>\"I think we have almost reached the point of no return. There are no good solutions left,\" said Ali Padsha, 19, who was raised in America. \"The longer foreign forces stay, the more problems will be created. When we [Afghans] see foreign forces in our country, it makes us crazy, it always has.</p> <p>\"The new Taliban are smarter than before and not as hardcore. They know what to do to keep the people happy.\"</p> <p>Seven years after the US-led invasion of Afghanistan, the situation is deteriorating rapidly. \"The rivers are running backwards,\" has become a popular lament in Kabul, whose residents are now looking to a change of leadership in America as the starting point for change in Afghanistan.</p> <p>Afghans generally favour Barack Obama. Some like him because he is the son of a Muslim, affectionately referring to him as Hussein Jan, adding Jan (an Afghan term of endearment) to his middle name. Many educated Afghans believe he has a more nuanced understanding of the regional predicament and support his plans to get tough with Pakistan. But others are cynical, seeing no difference between the candidates and viewing both men's commitment to sending more troops with hostility.</p> <p>Afghans face elections next year and are aware that the new American leader will play a defining role in determining who will be the next Afghan president. </p> <p>\"Whoever takes over America must bring a new leadership to Afghanistan,\" says Fahim Dashti, the editor of the popular Kabul Weekly. The victor will also have to work to counter the country's rampant anti-Americanism.</p> <p>\"The US has failed on everything they said they would do,\" says Dashti, a popular and influential thinker who fought with the Northern Alliance supported by America to drive out the Taliban in 2001.</p> <p>\"They said they were going to get rid of the Taliban - now the Taliban are at the edges of the city and even operating inside Kabul itself. They said they were going to end opium production but there is more opium than ever being produced. They said they were going to bring democracy but what we have is more like a dictatorship. Most people live beneath the poverty line and there is mass unemployment.\"</p> <p>Ali and his university friends are sympathetic to the incoming president. \"I feel bad for whoever wins this election,\" he said. \"They are going to have a really hard job cleaning up the mess left by the previous administration.\"<br><strong>Clancy Chassay</strong></p> <h2>Paris: 'Obama is France's ideal of the American dream'</h2> <p>Paris's Rue La Fayette, named after the great French hero of American independence, is known for its hordes of shopping US tourists. But struggling bars, hotels and even famous department stores are lamenting a fall in trade as US tourist numbers in Paris shrink to a record low. \"Business is down, we're all suffering,\" said Lionel Pinheiro, a waiter at one bistro. \"If Obama wins, I hope it might ease the financial crisis and bring the tourists back.\"</p> <p>Liberal Americans abroad have grown tired of having to apologise for their nationality during the Bush years. But France is now wondering: is it OK to start loving Americans again?</p> <p>\"We don't lynch Americans in the street,\" said Charlotte Lepri, a US specialist at the French thinktank, Institute for Research in Integrated Strategies (IRIS). \"But there are certain associations with Bush. Now there is a turnaround and real enthusiasm for a black candidate who represents France's ideal of the American dream.\"</p> <p>This new optimism could make it easier for the pro-US French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, to deepen rapprochement with Washington if Obama is elected. The latest poll shows over 70% of French people would vote for Obama. </p> <p>So great is the myth surrounding Obama, that some analysts warn the public could be in for a shock. The war in Afghanistan, France's increase in troops there and the growing death toll have unsettled public opinion. But few appear to realise that an Obama presidency will ask for more military involvement from allies. \"I don't think all French voters are aware of this part of his project, and they are going to get a surprise,\" said Jacques Mistral of the French Institute of International Relations (IFRI).<br><strong>Angelique Chrisafis</strong></p> <h2>Baghdad: 'The Republicans must finish their commitment'</h2> <p>Dr Amira Edan al-Dabab, above, has spent the past five years picking up the pieces of Iraq's plundered past and fears the results may again be lost if America elects Barack Obama.</p> <p>Since the fall of Baghdad in 2003, Edan, the director of the Iraqi Heritage and Antiquities Directorate, has been travelling the globe in search of up to 15,000 looted relics that used to comprise the essence of the National Museum of Iraq, treasures from three millennia which etched Iraq's place in the Arab heartland.</p> <p>Through half a decade of occupation, several years of brutal insurgency and attempts at sectarian cleansing, Iraq has seen tens of thousands of people killed, and at least two million leave. Security has improved and so too have prospects for some. But throughout Baghdad, many like Edan believe the country could again find itself at the edge of the precipice if the US doesn't tend to unfinished business.</p> <p>\"The Republicans must finish their commitment to Iraq, especially by signing the security treaty,\" she said. \"McCain is going to win,\" she continued. \"I read that the other man nominated is going to pull out the troops. We wish, we need and we hope that this won't happen.\"</p> <p>Most Iraqis seem more concerned about the short term. The time, they say, is not even nearly ripe for the Americans to leave and - for now - they'd rather the devil they know.</p> <p>Twenty kilometres north of Baghdad, the Tarmeya and Qadr district was until earlier this year the most active spot in the most dangerous area of Iraq. But the worm has turned. Tarmeyah is no longer an al-Qaida safe haven and McCain is seen as the best bet to keep it that way. </p> <p>\"If they go now, we may as well all leave too,\" said Bassam Jassam, from the region's dominant tribe, the Mashadani. \"McCain is best for us now. But we need to get through the next two years and after that all the Americans can leave.\"</p> <p>\"The thing we need is stability and strength,\" said Edan. \"If that goes, and it could, all of this could go again. There is so much at stake for us.\"<br><strong>Martin Chulov</strong></p> <h2>Beijing: 'America is going down while China is rising up'</h2> <p>Rao Jin has a soft spot for Barack Obama; he's drawn to his friendly face as well as admiring his personal achievements. But the hero of young Chinese nationalists stops well short of an endorsement.</p> <p>\"I hope the next president can really change the way the US deals with things, always using weapons or economic sanctions,\" says the 24-year-old founder of anti-CNN.com. \"The election has been a hot topic on our site. [But] one individual can't change much. Both Obama and McCain are standing for certain interest groups, and both of them will serve for America's benefit.\"</p> <p>Rao's website became a rallying point for fenqing (\"angry youth\") after the international storm over Tibet this year. He says it is not nationalist; merely a counterweight to western media bias and hegemony.</p> <p>For many in China, the US epitomises Occidental aggression and hypocrisy: preaching free trade but practising protectionism; idealising democracy while allowing vast donations; using human rights to justify invading Iraq.</p> <p>Some hope that Obama's mixed parentage and peripatetic childhood have made him more sympathetic to other cultures. He's popular among the young and there's fascination at the prospect of a black president - and what that would say about US tolerance of differences.</p> <p>But younger people are not counting on America to change itself. Many see the end of its global dominance as inevitable, given China's growing economic and international power.</p> <p>\"America is going down, while China is rising up,\" said Rao. Hu Ben, erstwhile Chinese subtitler for The West Wing and international editor for a major portal, added: \"A lot of young people still think America is our enemy. They're quite happy with the sub-prime crisis - they think this is China's chance.\"</p> <p>Officials and analysts also seem relaxed about the election result. The \"China card\" has been waved less often in this race than previous campaigns. They sense an emerging, broadly optimistic bipartisan consensus on Sino-US relations. John McCain appears more hawkish on security issues and relations with Taiwan, but Obama seems tougher on trade, Tibet, human rights and environmental protection.</p> <p>\"There will be differences on detailed issues, but the big picture won't change whoever wins,\" predicted Jin Canrong, associate dean of the School of International Studies at Renmin University.<br><strong>Tania Branigan</strong></p> <h2>Moscow: 'We don't beg from the west any more'</h2> <p>With its padded vinyl seats, chrome fittings and Wurlitzer jukebox, the famous Starlite Diner is a little corner of small-town America right in the heart of Moscow. When it opened in 1994, Russia was reeling in post-Soviet turmoil and was trying to court the west for much-needed investment.</p> <p>\"That's all changed now,\" said Sergei Demidov, 35, a banker, tucking into a plate of tenderloin steak and fries. \"We don't beg from the west any more and Washington can't order us around like it did in the 1990s.\"</p> <p>Relations between the US and a resurgent Russia hit a post-cold war low this summer after a fierce proxy conflict in former Soviet Georgia. Most Russians see the US as an aggressive bully that wants to encircle and weaken their country - regardless of whether a Democrat or a Republican is in charge.</p> <p>Barack Obama, however, is widely perceived as the lesser of two evils. A survey in October by Moscow's Levada Centre polling agency showed that 35% of Russians supported Obama, with 14% for John McCain and 37% confessing no sympathy for either. \"Obama would be better,\" said Maria Balandina, 26, an arts events manager. \"He's a democrat, he was against the war in Iraq, he's young.\"</p> <p>Former Vietnam pilot McCain, on the other hand, has called for Russia to be ousted from the G8 for allegedly backsliding on democracy and famously claimed he saw only the letters K-G-B in the eyes of Vladimir Putin (unlike George Bush, who thought he glimpsed the Russian leader's soul).</p> <p>However, observers say Obama's messianic zeal for reform inside America may not transform into a clear foreign policy. McCain, while a tough talker, might be more convenient for Kremlin hardliners who identify with his blunt rhetoric. \"Obama represents a new challenge for Moscow,\" said Andrei Kortunov, an analyst from the New Eurasia foundation. \"I'm just not sure Russia is ready for that challenge quite yet.\" <br><strong>Tom Parfitt</strong></p> <h2>Tehran: 'I'm not optimistic it will make much difference'</h2> <p>Rhythmic chants of \"Marg bar Amrika\" - \"death to America\" - boomed from loudspeakers in the streets as the crowd warmed up for Friday prayers, in an event unchanged since the 1979 revolution.</p> <p>Ayatollah Mohammad Emami-Kashani, frail but imposing in the white turban and brown robes of a senior cleric, lambasted \"global arrogance\". That is shorthand for the US, but he spells it out anyway. \"The claims the US makes against Iran are wrong. The world is waking up to its lies.\"</p> <p>Weekly prayers combine politics and religion, agitprop with faith. Mullahs, militiamen and civilians, including schoolchildren, are bussed in to sit on the mosque's pale green carpets. Women in black chadors are kept separate behind a screen. Kashani does not mention Barack Obama, though there is plenty of discussion of whether victory for him will do anything to improve relations between these old enemies.</p> <p>Iran's nuclear ambitions - which it insists are peaceful - and its role and influence in Iraq, Lebanon and Palestine, have kept it locked in confrontation with the US since George Bush included the Islamic republic in his \"axis of evil\" address in 2002. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, seemed to be signalling no change ahead last week when he called Iran's dispute with America \"deep-seated\". </p> <p>Still, Mohammad Khatami, the reformist former president, has spoken of \"new possibilities\" if Obama wins. Parliamentary speaker Ali Larijani found the Illinois senator \"more rational\" than John McCain.</p> <p>By coincidence, the word obama is close to the Farsi for \"with us,\" though few believe a Democratic victory will be enough to draw the sting from this relationship. Some think all the change must come from the US side - an unlikely prospect. \"I'm not optimistic it will make much difference to Iran,\" Mohsen Rezaei, ex-commander of the Revolutionary Guards, told the Guardian.</p> <p>Others hope it will. \"The countries that have good relations with the US see the benefits,\" said Mehdi, a young consultant, walking past Tehran's \"nest of spies\" - the old US embassy, still festooned in angry slogans. \"We should consider that.\"<br><strong>Ian Black</strong></p> <h2>Lahore: 'McCain understands the Pakistan reality better'</h2> <p>The liberal elite at Pakistan's most prestigious university, which offers American-style business education, look like their peers anywhere around the world. Except here many are backing John McCain.</p> <p>The students at the Lahore University of Management Sciences are not drawn to McCain as a person, saying that Barack Obama is far more appealing, but many believe McCain will be better for Pakistan, a view that is widely held across the country.</p> <p>It all goes back to Obama's statement that he would order unilateral and immediate strikes against Osama bin Laden in Pakistan if intelligence pointed to him being present in the country.</p> <p>\"Obama has stated, so clearly, that 'I'm going to attack Pakistan',\" said economics student Motahar Saleheen, between classes at the sprawling LUMS campus. \"One nation should not be allowed to interfere with the sovereignty of another.\"</p> <p>In Pakistan, Obama's remarks have been distilled down to a commitment to \"bomb Pakistan\", causing fury in a country fearful of becoming the next theatre of war in Washington's anti-terror fight.</p> <p>\"Tomorrow, if Obama attacks Pakistan, we will all rise up to defend ourselves, and the western media will brand us all terrorists,\" said fellow student Shahzad Mehboob.</p> <p>Even before Obama's position on Pakistan was known, there has long been a belief in the county that Republicans are more Pakistan-friendly than Democrats, rooted in the massive financial and military aid provided by he Eisenhower, Reagan and Bush presidencies to Islamabad.</p> <p>Pakistan has been a key ally of the Bush administration, which heavily backed the military-led regime of former president Pervez Musharraf, so the change in US president could have a profound impact on the country.</p> <p>\"John McCain understands the Pakistan reality better,\" said politics undergraduate Osama Khawar. \"But as a human being Obama is a better candidate. It's a dilemma for us.\"<br><strong>Saeed Shah</strong></p> <h2>Nairobi: 'Whether you're black or white, vote for Barack'</h2> <p>For reggae fans there is Makadem, for rock, Extra Golden. Folk lovers have Kenge Kenge while Tony Nyadundo offers a more traditional sound.</p> <p>All have recently released songs in Kenya with a common word in the title - Obama - and a similar message.</p> <p>\"If you're voting for real change, Barack Obama be the right man, whether you're black or white, young or old, vote for Barack, Barack Obama,\" sings Makadem, who launched the video for \"Obama be thy name\" at Nairobi's National Theatre last week.</p> <p>Obama-mania in Kenya is no surprise. The Democratic candidate's late father was Kenyan, and many of his relatives, including his 87-year-old step-grandmother Mama Sarah, still live here. Neither is it a recent phenomenon; during his Obama's trip to Kenya in 2006, thousands turned out to see him.</p> <p>But the presidential campaign has lifted the excitement to a new level. Obama's face now appears on many of the ubiquitous Matatu minibus taxis, thousands of bumper stickers bear his name. Locally printed campaign T-shirts are selling fast; one features the slogan \"Ndio Tunaweza\" - Swahili for \"Yes we can\". A musical based on Obama's memoir is set to open. Underlying the enthusiasm, is aspiration: many people still believe strongly in the American dream; Kenya has more students studying in the US than any other African country. And Obama, whose father travelled to Hawaii on a scholarship, is the ultimate embodiment of that immigrant dream.</p> <p>Policy-wise, a more nuanced US approach to terrorism issues, especially in places like Somalia, might be expected. But the biggest change may be intangible. One Kenyan columnist wrote this week an Obama win would unleash a \"momentum of enlightenment\" proving that talent and character rather than ethnicity and power should determine success.<br><strong>Xan Rice</strong></p> <h2>Gaza: 'Without pressure on Israel there's no solution'</h2> <p>Only a few years ago the bright yellow and orange al-Awda Factory for Biscuits and Ice Cream was a vibrant business and one of the largest factories in the Palestinian territories. Today, like most private firms in the Gaza Strip, it is in dire trouble.</p> <p>Only one of four production lines is working. There are barely two-dozen staff producing packets of hazelnut-flavoured wafers. There is not enough ink to print a sell-by date, not enough cardboard boxes to hold the packets, not enough plastic to wrap the boxes. When the wafers are delivered, they arrive at stores in old fruit cartons. Sales are down to 25% of what they were eight years ago. And this is a good day - for the previous week all production lines were shut down for want of ingredients, packaging and spare parts.</p> <p>The factors that have brought the biscuit factory to such a parlous state will be one of many unenviable Middle East challenges awaiting the new president.</p> <p>Since the Islamist movement Hamas won Palestinian elections in 2006 and then took full control of Gaza last year, Israel has gradually increased the pressure on what it calls the \"hostile entity\". It has severely limited imports and prohibited all exports. Few of Gaza's 1.5 million people can ever leave. Despite this, Hamas grows steadily stronger, not weaker.</p> <p>Like many Gazans, Mohammed Telbani, the factory's general manager, says he has little interest in the election. \"Presidents have changed but no one did anything for us,\" he said, waving his hand dismissively. He doubts that a new president will have the power or the will to reverse decades of US policy in the Middle East which he, like most here, sees as decisively pro-Israeli. \"Without pressure on Israel there won't be any solution to the problem,\" he said.</p> <p>If they had to choose, most Palestinians, like most other Arabs, would probably side with Obama (and, conversely, opinion polls show more Israelis would side with McCain). Gazans talk urgently about the need to lift the economic blockade of the strip, to allow the crossings to open and the economy to restart. Palestinians as a whole simply want Washington to play a much tougher role as a Middle East peace broker, bringing concrete change and eventually that much-promised independent Palestinian state.<br><strong>Rory McCarthy</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Monday November 3 2008.

  "<p>Gordon Brown yesterday said he felt confident that he has successfully enlisted the help of Gulf states for international plans for an emergency bail-out fund, with both Qatar and Saudi Arabia indicating they will offer funds when leaders of the 20 most developed countries meet in Washington in a fortnight. </p> <p>As the prime minister arrived in Qatar on the second leg of his whistlestop Gulf tour last night, the Qataris hinted they would contribute money to an International Monetary Fund bail-out fund - being billed as a \"new Bretton Woods\" after the initiative of 1944 - the details of which will be thrashed out in Washington on November 15. </p> <p>The prime minister, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani, said: \"We are sharing the same world. Qatar is not excluded, so we have to work together.\" </p> <p>Speaking after his three-hour private conversation with the King of Saudi Arabia on Saturday, Brown told the BBC's Sunday AM programme: \"The Saudis will, I think, contribute so we can have a bigger fund worldwide.\" Yesterday Kuwait said it had still not made up its mind.</p> <p>Brown's diplomacy appears to have been in the face of some disquiet among Arab leaders that they are being looked to to provide funds to shore up ailing countries. A senior government source involved in the talks said the Arab states did not want to be cast as the West's \"cash cow\". </p> <p>The business secretary, Peter Mandelson, travelling with Brown, also appeared to play down expectations of big results from the visit, telling journalists that the trip was a \"process, not an event\". </p> <p>The climate change minister, Ed Miliband, who was also in Qatar, signed a deal between Qatar and the UK to invest in the development of green technologies. Of the \u00a3250m Low Carbon Innovation Partnership, he announced \u00a3100m was to be provided by the government of Qatar to invest in research into sustainable energy in the UK. A further \u00a310m would come from the UK's Carbon Trust and the government hoped \u00a390m would be raised from investors.</p> <p>Miliband said: \"It will use British expertise in renewable technology, matching it with investment from Qatar and the private sector in Britain. It will help take us another step on the road to a green revolution.\"</p> <p>Though the trip has many ambitions, Brown has concentrated on securing Gulf support for the emergency IMF bail-out fund before the Washington summit. He believes the oil-rich countries in the Gulf have profited from the higher oil prices of recent years - something he put at $1tn - which he believes puts them in a position to contribute. He would like to see the $250bn in the IMF's pot increased by \"hundreds of billions\". </p> <p>Adding further significance to the Washington meeting, Brown told Sunday AM that the fall in inflation was creating the economic conditions for a fall in interest rates. The Bank of England's monetary policy committee meets this week to decide what to do.</p>",
  "<p>The government should revise its target to build 3m new homes by 2020 in the light of the economic downturn, which gives ministers a chance to save greenfield land from development, a committee of MPs says today.</p> <p>In a report, the environmental audit committee (EAC) calls on ministers to recognise that the slowing of the housing market means that greenfield sites could be developed unnecessarily if local authorities continue to face pressure to provide land.</p> <p>Gordon Brown announced in July last year that he wanted to build 2m new homes by 2016, with a further million by 2020. All new homes were to have a zero carbon rating from 2016 and there were to be 10 new eco-towns by 2020.</p> <p>Tim Yeo, the Conservative chairman of the EAC, called for a wholesale review of the targets. \"These ambitious targets were agreed in a time of economic optimism and easy credit,\" he said. \"Clearly the assumptions on which the 3m target was based must be reviewed in the current climate. This is an opportunity for the government to place environmental concerns at the heart both of targets and planning regulations for new housing.\"</p> <p>Yeo added \"The government needs to ensure that in the current market downturn, an excess of land is not made available to developers which could lead to greenfield land being developed in preference to brownfield. Once greenfield land is released for development, this land will be lost for ever.\"</p> <p>The Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) endorsed the committee's findings. Kate Gordon, CPRE's senior planner, said: \"The pressure for greenfield development will intensify in an economic downturn. Inflexible government targets and planning rules are forcing local councils across the country to needlessly allocate greenfield land for housing.</p> <p>\"It is vital that ... targets are revised to ensure that we recycle brownfield land and bring back into use empty buildings before building on green fields, just as the EAC has recommended.\"</p> <p>But Margaret Beckett, the housing minister, said that the government had no plans to water down its targets. \"We have shown we can build the homes that are needed whilst protecting the environment ... and preventing urban sprawl. Now is not the time to scale back on long-term ambitions because of economic difficulties.\"</p>",
  "<p>The case for building a third runway at Heathrow has been challenged by figures showing a significant fall in flights this winter as cabinet ministers join a Labour revolt against expanding the airport.</p> <p>The number of flights to and from Heathrow will fall by 1.9% this winter compared with the same period last year, according to figures obtained by the Guardian. The reduction, equivalent to 25 fewer flights a day, was pounced on by anti-expansion campaigners, who said it undermined one of the key arguments for a third runway: that the airport is too congested.</p> <p>\"It means a third runway is a bit of a gamble for [Heathrow owner] BAA. The government's aviation policy was drawn up in 2003 when aviation was expanding and the economy was booming. We are now in a different world,\" said John Stewart, chairman of the Hacan campaign group. </p> <p>According to the aviation white paper, a third runway is needed because the number of air passengers using UK airports will double to at least 460 million by 2030. A new runway would take Heathrow's capacity from 480,000 flights a year to 702,000. The overall economic benefit to the UK of expansion is put at \u00a35bn, with tens of thousands of jobs at stake.</p> <p>However, figures from the company in charge of coordinating takeoff and landing slots at Heathrow show that the schedule will reduce by 1.9% between October and March next year, due to high fuel costs and dwindling passenger demand. \"This is a reflection of the high fuel prices and weakening economy leading to airlines making tactical flight cancellations,\" said James Cole, of Airport Coordination Ltd. </p> <p>BAA said the long-term growth forecasts for aviation in the UK showed a different trend. \"History very clearly demonstrates that aviation recovers well from short-term events such as this economic downturn,\" said a BAA spokesman. </p> <p>It is also understood that a number of cabinet ministers believe agreeing to a third runway would damage the government's green credentials and cost marginal seats in the south-east. They believe ministers need to re-examine the issue in the light of the government's new commitment to cut carbon emissions by 80% by 2050, including emissions from aviation.</p> <p>The scale of the revolt spreading across the parliamentary party prompted Gordon Brown to meet Labour MPs to discuss the issue last week and agree to hold a further meeting with them this week. </p> <p>The transport secretary, Geoff Hoon, is due to make a decision next month on whether Heathrow expansion, including a sixth terminal, should go ahead, with ministers committed to the idea in principle since a white paper in 2003. </p> <p>But Brown is now coming under surprisingly strong last-minute pressure to rethink his strategy by at least putting the decision on hold until after a 2010 election, possibly by proposing the government put the issue into a new national planning statement on aviation and rail. </p> <p>MPs opposed to the expansion of Heathrow are reporting that they are receiving degrees of private support for their stance from Hilary Benn, the environment, food and rural affairs secretary, Ed Miliband, the new energy and climate secretary, Harriet Harman, the leader of the house, and the foreign secretary, David Miliband. Support is also coming from ministers of state. </p> <p>One MP said he had spoken to three minsters who had encouraged him to think the issue needed to be re-examined. </p> <p>Andy Slaughter, the MP for Ealing Acton and one of the group who met Brown last week, said: \"This issue is coming to a head and in the past few weeks there are signs of a change in mood. This is a vote- changing issue for the electorate, and with the Tories and the Liberals Democrats opposed to expansion, marginal seats will be lost unless the policy is rethought. </p> <p>\"There has been a sense in which the government went to sleep over the issue after the aviation white paper in 2003, and yet so much has changed since then, including our policy on climate change. </p> <p>\"More than one million people will be affected by this decision and now is the time to look at it afresh.\" </p> <p>So far, 41 Labour MPs from across the country have put their names to a parliamentary early day motion tabled by John Grogan, MP for Selby in North Yorkshire, calling on the government to rethink the third runway and instead start a consultation on a new national planning policy statement on airports and high-speed rail. </p> <p>John McDonnell, the MP for Hayes and Harlington, said 10 to 20 Labour seats across the south-east were at risk. \"If this gets the go-ahead, the government's increasingly deserved green credentials will be severely damaged.\"</p>",

The furore surrounding Sachsgate again shows the ferocity of stories fuelled by interactivity: 35,000 complaints so far, 49,000 comments on the BBC's Have Your Say site. How does the BBC begin to respond?</p> <p>The digital veteran Steve Bowbrick argues it could and should have reacted through its blogs, with a \"response blog\" from the managers who authorised the broadcast.</p> <p>But the BBC faces a tough task. A single company response is impossible in a social media environment where everyone has an opinion. Donald Steel, head of press, says the public value the BBC site's editorial independence, and that cannot be compromised by its corporate voice: \"We'll continue to consider blogging as an approach but it's a huge challenge because of the likely scale of the response.\"</p> <p>The technology consultant Martin Belam criticises the lack of a unified web response and says the BBC failed to limit the brand damage online. \"I'm sure the BBC's PRs have been trying to influence tomorrow's newspaper headlines all day,\" he blogged. \"Meanwhile [people] visited <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/\">bbc.co.uk</a> and [assumed] the BBC wasn't reacting to the crisis at all.\" He suggests a rapid response team able to update any part of the site. Otherwise \"it just gives the impression the BBC is paralysed\".</p>",
  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Tuesday November 4 2008</strong></p> <p>The Mail's parent company no longer has a stake in the commercial radio group GCap. Global Radio took over GCap earlier this year</p> <p> </p> <p>Last week may have seemed just another in the long decline of print.</p> <p>In America, Gannett, the largest newspaper publisher (and owner of the British Newsquest), proposed to lay off 10% of its workforce; Time Inc proposed to cut 600 jobs; the Christian Science Monitor dropped daily print publication. Here, the Wolverhampton Express and Star, the highest-selling regional paper, announced 10% cuts while Express Newspapers tried to persuade more than half its subeditors to volunteer or redundancy.</p> <p>But, in one respect, every newspaper employee in Britain should have felt a little bit more cheerful and positive about the future last week. Not for the first time, the Mail showed that, in this country at least, newspapers can still lead the news agenda and alter the national mood. The resignations of Russell Brand and Lesley Douglas, and the suspension of Jonathan Ross were a triumph both for the Daily Mail and its Sunday sister and for the papers' distinctive and, in many ways, quaint worldview. What is remarkable is not just that the Brand-Ross broadcast went unnoticed for seven days, but also that, even last Monday morning, after the Mail on Sunday had broken the story, most newsdesks still didn't see it as a big deal. The Guardian, Mirror and Express were among the papers that didn't follow it. The Sun put it on page 3, a sign that it rated it an entertaining curiosity and just another example of bad taste from a familiar quarter.</p> <p>Even the Mail - perhaps reluctant to go overboard on a story broken by a Sunday in the same house - didn't make it the splash, though it ran a front-page picture of Brand and inside, Melanie Phillips gave her usual imitation of a Victorian dowager who has overdosed on laudanum. Ross and Brand, she raved, were guilty of \"cruelty and indeed sadism\" and their behaviour was \"bordering on the psychopathic\". Her column attracted 209 comments (mostly anti-BBC) on the Mail website, the Sunday story 220 - numbers well above average. The Mail scented blood.</p> <p>Any MP able to string \"lewd\", \"offensive\" and \"disgusting\" into a coherent sentence was pursued for comment. \"Sack them!\" screamed the Mail's front page on Tuesday. The paper kept its teeth in the story to the end of the week, running a leader each day, and highlighting more examples of how the BBC was outraging \"decent people\", such as a show last week that made a \"disgracefully foul\" joke about the Queen. On Friday, Richard Littlejohn hailed \"a stunning victory over self-appointed, self-obsessed metropolitan narcissists who control so much of our public life\".</p> <p>Yes, I know. The Mail is hypocrisy on stilts. It claimed to find the broadcast offensive and hurtful to a 78-year-old man, but it ran the YouTube video of it on its website. It denounces cruelty and sadism while highlighting the tiniest physical flaws of anyone in the public eye, particularly women. It demands BBC heads should roll, but no Daily Mail executive was sacked when it was among 11 papers forced to apologise and pay damages to Robert Murat and two others over the Madeleine McCann case. It has a long-standing vendetta against the BBC but rarely mentions that its parent company has a stake in GCap, the UK's leading commercial radio group.</p> <p>Nevertheless, every editor - whatever his or her politics or position in the culture wars - can learn from the Mail's single-mindedness. Many young people adore Ross and Brand and won't thank the paper for hounding them off the airwaves. The Mail doesn't care. It reliably sets its face against what it sees as modish and insincere. It offers a view of the world - that everything has gone downhill since the 1950s, when women stayed in the kitchen, sex was saved for marriage and homosexuality was shameful - that is now rarely found elsewhere, not even in the Telegraph as that paper strives for a younger, trendier audience. It understands that one of a newspaper's functions is to give its readers a sense of security, belonging and simple values in an increasingly complex and unsettling world. The Mail is a supremely confident paper. Where others, trimming to focus groups, muffle their message, the Mail projects it relentlessly, and with great technical skill, from almost every page.</p> <p>The great strength of the British press is that it has a range of papers, each with its own character and identity. That explains why radio \"shock-jocks\" and internet bloggers don't have anything like the influence here that they have in America, where most newspapers are bland, characterless and cautious. </p> <p>If they are to survive, British papers need to preserve and develop their individuality. The Mail, in the past week, has shown them how.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Jane Johnson </strong>BSME chair; editorial director, Fabulous, and deputy editor, News of the World<br>\u2022 <strong>Vanity Fair, May 2008</strong></p> <p>The combined power of Madonna and the iconic magazine Vanity Fair make for a show-stopping cover. There isn't a more coveted cover star in the world than her Madgesty - especially at her half century. There is no more important global issue than climate change. Inspired by a mid-century fashion magazine cover, the visuals manage to be classic as well as bang up to date. And the fact that Madonna autographed the custom-made globe she's clutching for charity adds a clever twist. Most magazine editors would give up their favourite Jimmy Choos for celebrity access of this kind - at least Vanity Fair have used their 10th cover shoot with her wisely.</p> <p><strong>Conor McNicholas </strong>BSME vice-chair; editor, NME<br>\u2022 <strong>Private Eye issue 1219 - End of the World</strong></p> <p>At the height of the financial madness this cover made me stop and smile, delivering a succinct and biting verdict on the state of the world. No one else came close to this pithy analysis. It's also four great covers in one, which is always a sign that the office went into gag overdrive and couldn't decide on a favourite. Something tells me that were we ever to achieve armageddon Private Eye would still be out the following week, its cover featuring a mushroom cloud and a witty one-liner.</p> <p><strong>Amanda Baillieu </strong>Editor, Building Design<br>\u2022 <strong>The Economist, April 10 2008</strong></p> <p>As the world headed into recession, the Economist really got into its stride. People read the magazine because it's scrupulously fair and balanced, so when it puts a snail painted with the American flag on the cover you know something is seriously wrong. Like their best covers they've done this year, this one is really very simple, but conceptually summarises its editorial stand inside. </p> <p><strong>Jane Bruton </strong>Editor-in-chief, Grazia<br>\u2022 <strong>Observer Woman, October 2008</strong></p> <p>I loved Observer Woman's David Walliams cover. It was simple, witty and powerful, as well as wildly glamorous. Their cheeky take on celebrity is instantly visible and the fashion, as seen on Walliams, is oddly covetable. Everybody was talking about it.</p> <p><strong>Gillian Carter </strong>Editorial director, BBC Good Food magazine<br>\u2022 <strong>Homes &amp; Gardens, August 2008</strong></p> <p>This Homes &amp; Gardens cover gets my vote because it makes me want to be there - living a more lovely life in an ideal world. Well, we needed something to cheer up the terrible summer we had here. It sums up the magazine's contents in a restrained, non-shouty kind of way. I also really love the olive green masthead. </p> <p><strong>Celia Duncan </strong>Acting associate editor, Vogue<br>\u2022 <strong>Esquire, June 2008</strong></p> <p>In an amazing publicity coup, Esquire celebrated its 75th birthday by inviting 10 designers and photographers to reinterpret its archive of George Lois covers. Everyone from Karl Lagerfeld to Giorgio Armani took part, but it was Burberry's creative director, Christopher Bailey, or rather his co-star, a hirsute pig, who stole the show in a copy of Esquire's The Kids vs the Pigs issue. Not only did the covers dominate headlines in a brand-appropriate way, but they ensured Esquire pulled off the near-impossible: it succeeded in creating homages that became iconic in their own right, and now fetch a tidy sum on eBay. </p> <p><strong>Jo Elvin </strong>Editor, Glamour<br>\u2022 <strong>Pop, September 2008</strong></p> <p>I loved all the Pop covers in this split run (Amber, Jourdan, Natalia, Naomi and Oluchi) but Agyness Deyn was my favourite. For me, it is the arresting use of photography by Sebastian Faena and the typography that really make it stand out. I also love that they took such a recognisable \"face\" and did something extraordinary with it. It is the sort of cover that makes you do a double take.</p> <p><strong>Elsa McAlonan </strong>Former editor, Woman's Own<br>\u2022 <strong>Harper's Bazaar, November 2008</strong></p> <p>Creating a cover that makes you look twice is every magazine editor's dream - and challenge. The November 2008 cover of Bazaar is a real dream cover. All the elements come together - from the jewel-encrusted masthead to the swishy movement in the main image of 40-year-old supermodel Stephanie Seymour. The colour palette is both cool and elegant, the main coverline - The Icon Issue - jumps out and promises an issue packed with things you want to read about and look at. Bazaar is aimed at a sophisticated, discerning readership who know exactly what they want from a magazine and won't be fooled by gimmicks. Regular readers will love this cover - and I expect they'll pick up more than a few new fans this month too.</p> <p><strong>Morgan Rees </strong>Editor, Men's Health<br>\u2022 <strong>Wallpaper*, May 2008</strong></p> <p>The May 2008 edition of Wallpaper* magazine is one of the finest things that I have seen in a very long time. In the age of Photoshop it is rare to see something that genuinely stops you in your tracks. But commissioning the sculptor and designer Dan McPharlin to create this beautiful model did just that. It ticks all the boxes for a great cover: wit - it both surprises you and makes you instantly identify with it; simplicity; and a clear, confident understanding of who its reader is. It is a wonderful, original piece of art, but at the same time it punches its weight as a proposition on the shelves of any local newsagent.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown is on a tour of Gulf states drumming up orders with a delegation of ministers and business leaders, the size of which would make Margaret Thatcher blush. Mr Brown insists he has gone for a higher purpose, to bolster not the Treasury's empty coffers but the IMF's. Having already spent $29bn of its $250bn responding to emergency cash calls from Iceland, Hungary and Ukraine, the IMF is plainly in no shape to cope with the demands that could be made of it if another set of dominoes fall. Oil-producing countries need healthy customers and stable markets, so why should they not be prepared to recycle some of the windfall profits they made at a time when oil hit $147 a barrel on shoring up the needy and vulnerable, like Pakistan?</p> <p>Well, partly because a barrel is worth only $63 today, and Opec's emergency decision in Vienna to cut output by 5% may well not be enough to stop the price halving again. If it did, oil producers with raging inflation, like Venezuela, or even those with high inflation, like Russia, could well be destabilised, leading to further restrictions in supply. In a global slump, each country will respond first to the demands of its own industries and, as Opec said, the collapse in the price of oil could jeopardise existing oil projects and lead to the cancellation of others. Each would entail a medium-term shortage of supply. </p> <p>Besides, it is not Saudi banks that last year lent \u00a3750bn more than they were taking in deposits but British ones. The financial crisis was brought about first and foremost through over-leveraging in the west. While it is clear that a government has a duty to protect its citizens from the effects of a collapse in the banking system, how does that argument apply to other countries whose banks behaved more prudently? But perhaps the biggest question facing the cash-rich Gulf states is why they should use the IMF at all to channel their funds to their less well-off neighbours.</p> <p>Pakistan's newly elected president, Asif Ali Zardari, will arrive in Saudi Arabia this week to seek help with oil payments. Pakistan has already asked Riyadh to defer payments for imports of crude worth nearly $6bn this year. Saudi Arabia is more likely to want to top up funds that the IMF gives Pakistan and increase its influence over the political leadership in Islamabad in the process, rather than top up the IMF, in which it has only 3% of the votes. America seeks the same influence, through direct funds to Pakistan's army, for its part in the war against the militants. Given the IMF's current domination by the United States and the G7 industrialised countries, the more likely scenario is that the Gulf states will await a meeting of the G20 nations to be held in Washington in two weeks' time to hammer out a reform of the global financial system.</p> <p>Two weeks in this crisis is a long time, but one can already predict the mood of this meeting. On Saturday a senior Bank of China executive said China had already started to feel the impact of the crisis, with a sharp slowdown in industrial profit growth. The central bank in India cut its main lending rate for the second time in two weeks and Russia took $6.4bn from its national wealth fund (the fund created after the collapse of the rouble in the last crash) to staunch the bleeding wounds of its own stockmarket. Mr Brown was arguing for a reform of the IMF and the World Bank long before this latest crisis. But the viral nature of the collapse is unlikely to lead now to a mood of generosity by nations whose voice largely went unheard when times were good. Besides, China, Russia and the Gulf states would all do better to develop their own economies while they still have the money. If a new global financial system were to emerge from the ashes of the current one, it is likely to be one where the G7 calls fewer of the shots. Nations like China and India might be wary of responding to entreaties to play ball until that lesson has sunk in.</p>",
  "<p>From a small fleet of luxury yachts to mansions and chateaux scattered among the world's most exclusive resorts, the opulent lifestyle of Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich has been laid bare.</p> <p>In a 134-page ruling at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, Mr Justice Christopher Clarke gave an intriguing glimpse into the lives of the super-rich, revealing a wealth of detail - from the Chelsea owner's labyrinthine business holdings to his intercontinental property portfolio and even the number of days he spent in the UK last year: 57.</p> <p>\"Abramovich is a billionaire,\" said Clarke. \"His overall wealth is said to be such that the \u00a330m that he spent on [property in Knightsbridge] represents less than 0.5% of his estimated net worth.\"</p> <p>The judgment came in the latest of a series of cases in English courts that have explored the opaque dealings of the billionaire Russian oligarchs who divide their time between London, Moscow and continental Europe.</p> <p>Abramovich, 42, was facing claims by the energy company Yugraneft that it was cheated out of its 50% stake in an oilfield in Siberia. Abramovich successfully fought off the \u00a32.5bn claim after the high court ruled that he was neither \"resident\" nor \"domiciled\" in Britain and therefore the case could not be heard here.</p> <p>\"He spends more time in Russia than anywhere else and his business and personal interests are focused on Russia,\" said the judge. \"Virtually all of the business associates with whom he is said to have dealt in these proceedings are Russian.\"</p> <p>To underpin the detailed legal argument the judge delved into the tycoon's private life, listing a host of multimillion-pound properties, yachts and planes to demonstrate the global nature of his business empire.</p> <p>Clarke said that seven years ago Abramovich had owned \"a chateau in France, some real estate in England and, elsewhere, a yacht, a plane and a helicopter\".</p> <p>Fast-forward to 2008 and his empire has expanded, according to the ruling delivered last week. \"[His assets are now] worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with properties acquired and renovated in the UK, France, Sardinia, the US and St Barts in the Caribbean, and Chelsea FC.\"</p> <p>Among his homes, three of four multimillion-pound properties in the UK were given to his ex-wife, Irina, as part of their divorce settlement last year.</p> <p>At one address in Lowndes Square, Knightsbridge, the court heard that the Russian has bought \"eight or nine flats\" which he reportedly plans to turn into a \u00a3150m house with bullet- and blast-proof windows and separate housing for staff and bodyguards. But the oligarch's English homes are just the tip of his international estate. The ruling revealed that outside the UK Abramovich also owns:</p> <p>\u2022 Two ski chalets in Colorado</p> <p>\u2022 A villa in St Barts</p> <p>\u2022 A French chateau</p> <p>\u2022 \"A grand historic house\" rented from the Russian government</p> <p>\u2022 Leonid Brezhnev's former home in Moscow</p> <p>Abramovich has a hectic schedule, flitting between Russia, the UK and Europe. In 2007, the court heard, he spent an average of just over a day and a half at a time in the UK, with his longest stay stretching 11 days, during which he attended four football matches. \"Such visits are not the sort that suggest an intention to make England one's usual or settled place of abode,\" noted the judge. \"In 2007 he spent only 57 full days here, virtually all in connection with football matches.\"</p> <p>The judge said a \"very large\" percentage of his visits to England were connected with Chelsea which he bought in 2003, rather than any personal or professional ties. Abramovich has poured hundreds of millions into the club but Clarke described his involvement as a \"hobby and a leisure interest ... It is not a business investment. The sums that Mr Abramovich has given to the club far exceed any return that could possibly be expected\".</p> <p>To facilitate his globetrotting trips between Stamford Bridge, Russia and the Caribbean, Abramovich makes use of private jets, helicopters and supercars. The court ruling said that he \"charters several yachts\" and \"leases aircraft for use when he is in England\". </p> <p>And according to press reports, his latest extravagance is entering its final phase in a German shipyard. For now, it simply goes by its codename, Project M-147, but when the covers come off the Eclipse in a few months' time, the 550ft-long, 12,000-tonne vessel is expected to be the world's largest privately-owned.</p> <h2>The road to riches</h2> <p>Roman Abramovich, who came to public attention in Britain when he bought <strong>Chelsea</strong> in <strong>2003</strong>, made his fortune in post-Soviet Russia. He became involved in <strong>oil export</strong> deals and in <strong>1995</strong> entered the ranks of the super-rich when with <strong>Boris Berezovsky</strong> he took over oil company <strong>Sibneft</strong> for a fraction of its market value. Abramovich gained increasing <strong>control</strong> over the business and got most of the money when it was sold in <strong>2005</strong> for <strong>\u00a37.5bn</strong>. More recent acquisitions include stakes in Russian steelmaker <strong>Evraz Group</strong> and a piece of the UK mining company <strong>Highland Gold</strong>. Since buying Chelsea, in a deal worth <strong>\u00a3140m</strong>, he is thought to have invested <strong>\u00a3578m</strong> in the club. He has an interest in art and was revealed as the buyer of <strong>Lucian Freud's</strong> Benefits Supervisor Sleeping (\u00a317m) and <strong>Francis Bacon's</strong> Triptych (\u00a343m). He is 15th in the Forbes rich list, with \u00a314.6bn.<br><strong>Holly Bentley </strong></p>",
  "<p>BT is planning to raise the staff retirement age as its \u00a337bn pension scheme - the largest private-sector guaranteed fund in Britain - looks set to drop into a multibillion-pound deficit after the collapse of global stockmarkets.</p> <p>BT will update the City on the size of the fund's deficit when it reports second-quarter figures next week amid growing concerns that paying more into the fund will reduce scope for dividend payouts. The fears were heightened by last week's shock profits warning, which saw the company's shares drop under the price at which they were floated by the government of Margaret Thatcher.</p> <p>BT is in talks with unions and its trustees on a range of possible changes to boost the fund - including raising the retirement age to 65, increasing staff contributions and basing payments on career average rather than final salary.</p> <p>\"We have been talking to the trustees and the unions for some months to make sure that our pension schemes are sustainable for the long term,\" said a spokesman. \"We have no intention of closing any of our pension schemes. In fact this review is taking place in order to protect the schemes and its members.\"</p> <p>An independent pension consultant today warns that the British taxpayer could have to write a \u00a316bn cheque to bail out the fund if BT gets into trouble. A sizeable chunk of BT's pension fund - about 75% according to the firm's estimates - is covered by the government under a crown guarantee that was put in place when BT was privatised in 1984. This guarantee covers the pensions of employees who worked for BT when it was state owned and comes into effect only if the business collapses.</p> <p>John Ralfe, independent pension consultant and former head of corporate finance at Boots, reckons that at the end of September the fund had total liabilities of \u00a355.5bn and assets of \u00a334.2bn. The scheme has 65,000 active members, 275,000 deferred and a further 20,000 in a defined-contributions scheme. BT closed its final-salary scheme in April 2001.</p> <p>Ralfe says that if BT ran into trouble the guarantee would leave the government having to write a \u00a316bn cheque to ensure everyone already promised a BT pension would receive one when they retired. </p> <p>\"This is all hypothetical because it only comes into effect if BT goes into liquidation,\" stressed a BT spokesman. He refused to say more as the company is in closed period before the release of its figures on November 13. </p> <p>At the time of the company's first-quarter results, in late July, BT said its pension scheme was showing a deficit of \u00a3600m at the end of the previous month, compared with a surplus at the same time in 2007 of \u00a31.4bn. The scheme had assets of \u00a336.8bn at the end of June 2008 compared with \u00a339.5bn at June 30 2007.</p> <p>Since then, the FTSE 100 index has plunged from 5625 points at the end of July to 4902 at the end of September. </p> <p>It then dropped as low as 3852 last month. Bernstein Research says the fund is now \u00a35bn in the red as a result. </p> <p>BT will provide the latest figure - calculated under the IAS 19 accounting rule - next week and the fund's actuaries, Watson Wyatt, will begin the triennial valuation at the end of the year.</p>",
  "<p>The AA has urged the government to put downward pressure on petrol prices by publishing a wholesale price table.</p> <p>The motorists' organisation said forcing wholesalers to reveal the cost of fuel before it hits forecourts would expose profiteering when a drop in the oil price is not matched by a reduction in pump prices. Such a move would follow the example of Australia, where a wholesale chart was published after a competition watchdog's investigation.</p> <p>\"The wholesale price is not published in the public domain and we do not think it is fair,\" said Edmund King, the AA's president. \"As a nation, whether we like it or not, we are dependent on diesel and petrol. It affects commerce and mobility. This is a crucial national issue and there ought to be more transparency.\" </p> <p>The wholesale price for petrol sold by suppliers such as Petroplus and Ineos is available only through expensive database subscriptions. The AA admitted that the government was unlikely to reach an agreement with suppliers over disclosing full prices but could indicate whether the trend is downward or upward. </p> <p>Ministers would remain under pressure to reduce petrol costs if the chancellor, Alistair Darling, signals a 2p rise in fuel duty in the pre-budget report, the AA added. The average price for a litre of unleaded petrol has fallen below 100p only recently and stands at 97.82p.</p> <p>Analysis by the Guardian has shown that petrol is still expensive in relation to the global oil price. The average pump price is falling by about 1p every five days but still needs to fall by another 5.8p a litre if it is to match recent declines in the price of oil.</p> <p>The AA argues that the wholesale price - or the cost of petrol once it emerges from the refinery before being sold on by suppliers - is a more effective measure of whether consumers are being short-changed than the cost of a barrel of crude.</p> <p>Petrol prices started to fall across Britain after repeated interventions last month by the prime minister.

  "<p>Four leading European banks have set aside a combined pot of \u00a37.45bn to cover six-month staff costs - including discretionary bonuses - for 72,000 investment bankers, many of them employed in the City of London, according to Guardian research.</p> <p>With the near collapse of the financial system putting pay for bankers on the political agenda, the investment banking division of Barclays has set aside a \"staff cost\" pot for the first half of the year of \u00a31.16bn. Similar pay and bonus pots for investment banking operations at Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse and UBS - all large employers in Britain - amounted to \u00a32.12bn, \u00a32.27bn and \u00a31.91bn respectively for the same six-month period.</p> <p>On Saturday the Guardian revealed that Royal Bank of Scotland, which has accepted \u00a320bn of taxpayers' money, had set aside \u00a31.79bn for staff compensation.</p> <p>A source at one of the investment bank divisions, which posted deep losses in the first half of 2008, told the Guardian: \"What you have to understand is that the losses are in a very, very small part of the business. A lot of other parts of our investment banking division did very well ... We still will pay bonuses for performance - otherwise you are out of business.\"</p> <p>High-profile executives at Barclays, UBS and Deutsche Bank have told angry investors they will forgo their annual bonuses but it has become clear many investment banking businesses are quietly setting aside sizable salary and bonus pots to ensure they retain their star performers.</p> <p>Another investment banking source said: \"We can all debate bonuses and whether they are out of line with reality but if you are going to operate these businesses you have to pay people well, including bonuses.\"</p> <p>The total set aside for staff by the four banks for the first six months of the year is 40% lower than for the same period in 2007 - a boom spell for investment banking before the credit crunch struck. Despite the year-on-year reductions, the banks are still understood to be preparing sizable bonus payouts this year. Last month the pay and bonus pot earmarked by Credit Suisse for its 21,300-strong investment banking division had reached Sfr5.67bn (\u00a33.04bn) for the first nine months of the year, down 30% on the previous year. The division has generated losses for the nine months to the end of September of Sfr6.4bn compared with an operating profit of Sfr4.4bn for the same period in 2007.</p> <p>Last week Deutsche Bank's 15,547-strong Corporate and Investment Bank division revealed its nine-month pay and bonus fund had reached \u20ac3.25bn (\u00a32.58bn), down 38% on the previous year. At the same time it posted a nine-month loss of \u20ac1.89bn, compared with a profit for the same period in 2007 of \u20ac4.48bn.</p> <p>Barclays released a limited third-quarter trading statement on Friday revealing that write-downs at its investment banking business Barclays Capital had risen by \u00a31.2bn to \u00a34bn. The statement gave no update on the amount set aside for pay and bonuses.</p> <p>Barclays Capital had shown \"strong growth\" in several product areas, the statement said, while write-downs were blamed on \"dislocation\" in the credit market. Asked about bonuses, chairman Marcus Agius said: \"Barclays, in common with every other bank around the world I would guess, is giving very careful thought to the whole question of the structure of remuneration and what we should do with it. It is premature to tell you what we are going to come out with in the new year, but I can assure you it will be different.

  "<p>Whether it's front runner Barack Obama or outsider John McCain who makes it to the White House when America goes to the polls tomorrow, the first briefing the new president gets on the economy from the US treasury and the Federal Reserve will be a sombre affair. Rarely, if ever, in the postwar period has a new chief executive faced a more challenging baptism.</p> <p>On the plus side, circumstances do not look quite so bleak as they did a month ago, when there was justifiable concern that the entire global financial system was on the point of collapse. One positive result from the mayhem that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers was that it forced policymakers around the world to act quickly, decisively and collectively to halt the slide into the abyss.</p> <p>Japan's decision last week to force down the value of the yen was partly driven by the need to help the big exporters on whom the economy relies, but it was also intended to boost capital flows into the US through the sale of yen for dollars. That was one reason Wall Street rallied so strongly.</p> <p>Policy action has not been confined to recapitalising the banks and injecting large dollops of cheap money into financial markets in the hope that it will persuade banks to start lending to one another once again.</p> <p>Monetary policy is being eased everywhere, with the expectation that the Fed will join Japan in having a policy rate below 1% by the end of the year. Rates in the UK are also set to tumble: Roger Bootle at Capital Economics believes they could be cut to 1% in 2009 as the Bank of England tries to jump-start the economy. Rates have never been lower than 2% in the postwar era.</p> <h2>Deepest recession</h2> <p>Central banks will be able to use easing inflationary pressure to justify these rock-bottom interest rates. Oil prices are less than half their peak of early July, and other commodity prices are also down sharply as global demand weakens. The new US president will be hoping that the boost to real incomes from cheaper gasoline prices provides a boost to confidence and spending.</p> <p>That, though, is just about the extent of the good news. The bad news for Obama or McCain is that the US and the other members of the G7 industrialised nations face the deepest recession since the 1930s; that the crisis has not gone away, merely been pushed - perhaps temporarily - from the core of the system to the emerging markets; and that the dominant financial model of the past decade and more is bust.</p> <p>Part of the problem, as Stephen Lewis of Monument Securities has noted, is that it has taken far too long for policymakers to understand that they cannot shove the genie back into the bottle, and as a result the downturn in prospect for 2009 and 2010 will be much deeper than it ought to have been.</p> <p>\"If the G7 had recognised at an early stage, say a year ago, that the financial capitalism model was irretrievably broken, they might have managed the transition to a new economic model at less cost than they have subsequently incurred,\" Lewis says. \"They might have dissolved the investment banks and the toxic products they had created before a negative feedback loop from the economy to the financial sector was established.\"</p> <p>That \"negative feedback loop\" works as follows. The financial sector goes haywire during the boom years, developing business models that work only in the good times. As the Bank of England noted in last week's financial stability report, the British banking system was lending \u00a3750bn more than it was taking in deposits, covering the gap by raising money in the wholesale markets and betting that the good times would go on for ever. When the bust arrives, the model collapses and the financial sector retrenches. It severely rations credit, with the result that house prices fall, businesses go bust and people lose their jobs. The losses of the financial sector mount, leaving them short of capital and even more unwilling to lend.</p> <p>Everything that policymakers have done over the past month - from nationalisation of banks to cuts in interest rates - has been designed to break this vicious circle. Their efforts have worked to the extent that money market rates have started to fall, but this is a skirmish in a much longer war.</p> <p>In the US, for example, the official interest rate has come down from 5.25% in the summer to 1%, yet mortgage rates have not fallen as much. The 30-year home loan rate has declined by a little over half a percentage point, a tiny reduction in the context of the biggest housing boom-bust in American history. Mortgage rates at their current levels mean the real estate market will remain in crisis, with knock-on effects for all those under-performing mortgage-backed securities held by the banks.</p> <h2>Crowding out</h2> <p>Policymakers also need to be aware of the dangers of what economists term \"crowding out\". This is where a big increase in borrowing by governments makes it more expensive for the private sector to obtain funds. In the context of a global economy, there is the added dimension of sovereign \"crowding out\", whereby the need to bolster the countries at the core of the global financial system leads to a dearth of funds for weaker countries. There is evidence of both these phenomena: upward pressure on non-investment corporate bond yields and in the problems faced by Iceland, Hungary, Ukraine and other emerging economies.</p> <p>Equally, the fall in the cost of crude may be good news for western consumers but it is not so hot for the oil-exporting countries, many of which are hardly models of stable democracies. A further halving of the oil price to about $30 a barrel could quite easily lead to severe political unrest, perhaps even revolution, resulting in restrictions in supply and a surge in crude prices to the peak levels reached earlier this year.</p> <p>The message for Obama or McCain is simple. Things have moved on apace even from where they were in the summer when only one of the 17 agenda items for the new president listed by the Associated Press mentioned the credit crisis. So far, America's downturn has been shallow, but the squeeze on consumer incomes and the deteriorating labour markets mean there is worse to come. The US will be in recession in 2009, as will the eurozone, Japan and Britain, and for the G7 as a whole this is likely to be the worst downturn since the second world war. The big developing countries, China in particular, cannot be immune from the problems in the west; given the export-dominated nature of these economies it was always fanciful to suppose that they could decouple themselves.</p> <p>All of which suggests that the new president faces an economic challenge as testing as any since Roosevelt arrived in the White House in 1933. The good news is that even using the most pessimistic assumptions it is hard to see a peak-to-trough decline in US GDP of anything like the sort suffered in the Great Depression, when the economy contracted by 25%.</p> <p>The bad news for tomorrow's victor is that FDR arrived after the worst of the slump was over, rather than just as it began. Even if everything goes according to plan and there are no policy errors, America will still have a recession every bit as costly as those in the 1970s and 1980s. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Can we add the environment to the roll call of casualties of recession? There is a nail-biting tussle going on at the centre of government about the planned expansion of both Heathrow and Stansted airports, and all the signs are that No 10 remains on the wrong side of the argument. Get ready for this: \"In these difficult times it is - hrrumph - all the more important to listen to business and - hrrumph - invest for the future.\"</p> <p>The prime case against another runway at Heathrow, and a major expansion at Stansted, remains stark. If you take climate change seriously then you can't go along with a philosophy of constant and continuing expansion of air travel. While it's true that carbon emissions from air travel are only around 6.3% of the UK's total, this is likely to soar. Listen to this: \"Forecasts suggest that emissions from flying could make up between 10 and 16% of the UK's contribution to climate change by 2020, if no action is taken to lessen the environmental impacts.\" Alarmist Guardian nonsense? Er, no, actually, it comes from the government's own website.</p> <p>Yet when it comes to a choice between general principle and the sharp pointed edge of a business lobbying campaign, things don't work out that way. Heathrow has atrocious road links back into London. Most of the year, most times of the day, they seem to be snarled up and crawling. Its jets roar over densely populated areas every 30 seconds at some periods, with a level of noise pollution that is becoming intolerable, particularly for the lower income housing nearest the airport. </p> <p>When T5 was being lobbied for, everyone was promised this was not a prelude to a third runway, and when the inquiry into the runway took place, we were assured it was a genuinely open one, and that all options were on the table. Now the government faces a backbench revolt, the mask slips. Briefings over the past few days suggest that Gordon Brown and Geoff Hoon, the transport secretary, will ride roughshod over the critics. They want to push through approval of the new runway so that when the Tories come to power, it's too late to cancel. \"We have to show that we are on the side of business,\" says one minister.</p> <p>The story with Stansted is similar. Here BAA wants to double the number of flights to almost half a million a year, adding 40 million passengers. The expansion plan would destroy numerous listed buildings and two ancient monuments, and gobble up three square miles of countryside. As with Heathrow, the impatience of ministers is palpable. The planning inspector was told his report was wanted by Christmas, which is considerably earlier than it would normally be, and the public inquiry is being accelerated so the go-ahead can be given before the general election.</p> <p>The Conservatives are for now on the other side of the argument. They have said they would refuse permission for the Stansted expansion and are hostile to the third Heathrow runway, suggesting a new high-speed rail link to the north and Midlands instead. Separately, the London mayor, Boris Johnson, has revived the idea of a new airport to the east of the city, at the Isle of Sheppey in Kent.</p> <p>There is no doubt that the expansion plans for both airports are hugely unpopular in the areas affected by their flightpaths. A swath of Labour ministers and MPs can expect to lose their seats if Heathrow's third runway is given the go-ahead. Tory opposition doesn't just fit with their proclaimed green agenda, but makes good sense politically. Which raises the obvious question: what in the world is No 10 up to?</p> <p>The most cynical explanation, which I have heard buzzing around in the past few days, is simply that ministers who know they have lost the next election are cosying up to the business interests that may help them out in the private sector afterwards. New Labour has close links with BAA, and the big-business lobby for Heathrow may still be in a position to offer cushy jobs, recession or not. Loth as I am to admit there might be a shred of truth in that, it wouldn't be the first time favours done in government have been repaid afterwards.</p> <p>Gordon Brown is not that kind of character. More likely, but just as dangerous, is that he believes this is clever politics. He thinks that in a recession, the party which seems most pro-business will gain. As deep fear grips the electorate over unemployment and bankruptcy, green arguments about the way we live, about pollution and climate change, will seem merely namby-pamby and irrelevant. If Labour commits itself to job-creating grand projects, and the Tories are forced to promise to try to halt them, then it is David Cameron who will suddenly look silly and old-fashioned.</p> <p>But how does that fit with rushing through the decisions before the election? Surely, if Brown thinks expanding Heathrow and Stansted will be popular, and opposing it will lose Cameron votes in bleak times, he should want the choice left as clear and open as possible when the election comes. Why the rush? Why the first signs of a dirty tricks campaign aimed at John Grogan, the Labour backbencher leading the revolt? Why not let the inquiries play out in their own good time? After all, with airlines going bust all over the place, and the pound weak, we hardly need much busier skies tomorrow.</p> <p>I fear what has happened is this. Brown, as a classic Labour man, was never keen on the environmental arguments. Hearing Cameron chirrup on about voting blue and going green merely stoked his contempt. He doesn't much care about a clutch of ministers and MPs whose seats will be lost if Heathrow expands; he's more interested in a national argument about priorities. Heathrow and Stansted have become willing conscripts for his assault on the recession. And if it all goes wrong, the Tories will be left to pick up the pieces. </p> <p>Is this not the politics of despair? To write off seats as lost before the election happens; to ditch the single most important long-term argument about the way we live? And to plan to attack the Tories for the only distinctively progressive policy they have had is hardly the strategy of a self-confident administration. The cabinet itself, like the parliamentary Labour party, is still divided. But the minister from whom we haven't yet heard a cheep is the new energy and climate change secretary Ed Miliband. </p> <p>He's been spoken of as a future leader. He is often at the PM's side. Yet he is said not yet to be \"fully briefed\" about the arguments and is therefore not ready to comment. Well, if your grand new cabinet title means a thing, and you're really made of the right stuff - now, Ed, is the time for an ear-splitting cheep.<br><a href=\"mailto:jackie.ashley@theguardian.com\"><br>jackie.ashley@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>On the lookout for \"cracks in the regime\", analysts of Iran had a thrill last month. The bazaars of Isfahan, Tehran, and several other cities went on strike for the first time in a generation. </p> <p>In the labyrinth of vaulted passages the richest traders were always the jewellers. Their glittering windows are rarely without at least one mother and daughter glued to the glass. When one pair of black chadors goes in to buy or moves away, another takes its place. The hunt for the right wedding ring is constant and business never flags.</p> <p>Except three weeks ago, when Isfahan's goldsmiths closed their doors, soon followed by jewellers elsewhere. Spice merchants and clothes stores joined in, and the heavy wooden doors of Isfahan's bazaar swung shut. </p> <p>Police swooped on the homes of suspected strike leaders but it was not just repression that ended the protest a day or two later. The government caved in, releasing the detainees and announcing that plans to introduce value added tax, the cause of the anger, would be suspended for a year. </p> <p>Outside Iran, the regime's critics excitedly recalled that the bazaaris have not struck since the months before the Shah's fall three decades ago. Traditionally anti-western, and with close ties to the clergy, they helped to produce the Islamic revolution in 1979. They still control a large chunk of Iran's wholesale trade and distribution networks. Their donations help to fund the mosques. If the bazaaris break ranks, something truly big is under way.</p> <p>So goes the wishful thinking, but it is wrong. First, what infuriated the bazaaris was not the tax (a modest 3%) but the fact that it would require them to open their books for the first time. They were resisting President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's cautious attempts at modernisation, not protesting against dictatorship. Second, the \"cracks in the regime\" theory assumes a brittle monolith. But neither my fleeting impressions from visiting seven Iranian cities nor the comments of Iranian pundits put the country anywhere close to this. On the contrary, calm and normality are what strike you. The western stereotype of a threatening and dangerous country is wide of the mark. People regularly greet foreigners with \"Welcome to Iran\", partly to practise their English but also to thank you for resisting panic and coming to see for yourself. </p> <p>Such analysts as Bijan Khajehpour, who heads a strategic consulting firm in Tehran, see Iran becoming more homogeneous over time. The divide between big cities and smaller rural towns is shrinking, he says, as young people aspire to learn English and computer skills, follow global dress and music codes, and embrace consumerism. Saeed Leylaz, the editor of Sarmayeh, a financial daily, notes an opposite tendency at least in the economy - a widening of the income gap over the last three years. Ahmadinejad's highly publicised tours to small towns and villages, and the largesse he gives for local projects, have not increased equality. Galloping inflation, which has just reached 30% annually, hits the poorest hardest. \"In the last year of Khatami [the previous president] the Gini coefficient for income inequality was 0.39. Now it's 0.43, not far below the 0.45 of the Shah's worst period,\" Leylaz says.</p> <p>The fall in oil prices and the improbability of any early upturn are plunging Iran into a financial crisis as sharp and sudden as that of western economies. This threatens living standards far more than western sanctions. Experts calculate that Iran needs a price of at least $76 a barrel, compared to the current $60, to prevent a rise in the government's budget deficit as well as a trade deficit that will require a slash in imports. Yet the likelihood that Iran's crisis will lead to a political upheaval is as remote as the chance that the wreck of western neoliberalism will produce revolution in the US and Europe.</p> <p>Iran's system is flexible and resilient. Media controls are strong but getting less so. State TV reported the bazaar strikes because most families, in the smaller towns as well as Tehran, watch foreign TV via satellite dishes installed through the black market. The government has to put its own spin on bad news rather than ignore it. </p> <p>With presidential elections next June the political factions are filling the print media, as well as parliament, with heated arguments over domestic and foreign policy. If one test of democracy is having elections in which the result is unpredictable, Iran certainly passes it. \"The key point,\" as Khajehpour puts it, \"is that we don't have a dominant political faction or agenda nowadays. They are all minorities.\" As many as six credible candidates may contest the first round before a French-style run-off.</p> <p>Ahmadinejad represents the conservatives. They prefer to call themselves \"principle-ists\" since they believe in the principles of Islam and a strong Iranian (that is, non-western) identity. But Ahmadinejad comes under frequent attack from \"radical principle-ists\" as well as other moderate conservatives like himself. Amir Mohebbian, an economic commentator for the conservative paper Resalat, criticises the president's poor choice of words before foreign audiences as well as aspects of his tax and welfare policies.</p> <p>A parliamentary showdown is looming over Ali Kordan, the interior minister, who will be impeached this week for faking his university degrees. This could trigger a vote of no confidence in Ahmadinejad's government. Some commentators say his reformist opponents may not support it. \"They don't want to make him a martyr. They think he will not be re-elected next year anyway,\" says one analyst who prefers to keep his name unpublished.</p> <p>Foreign critics may claim that in spite of boisterous faction-fighting, Iranian politics are imprisoned within a narrow spectrum of ideas and therefore count as undemocratic. But don't European and US politics also display what the French call pens\u00e9e unique? It is only when societies are already moving into instability that the political class begins to tolerate, or is forced to accept, a widening of the margins for debate. </p> <p>Iran is becoming more secular. A group of mullahs in Shiraz concede that fewer people attend mosques than a decade ago \"because more time has passed since the revolution\". Ali Reza Manaei, a guide at Tehran's martyrs' museum and a member of the Basij, a group of revolutionary volunteers, complains that the values of social solidarity are ebbing while corruption is on the rise. \"The government's behaviour has got worse, and so has people's behaviour towards one other,\" he says.</p> <p>Even Ahmadinejad is a quasi-secularist. Formed politically by the eight-year war with Iraq, \"he represents a kind of thinking that doesn't see a huge value in having the clergy in power,\" one commentator argues. Another points out that the president feels he has a direct link to the Hidden Imam (the Shia version of the returning messiah) and can dispense with the mediation of clerics. </p> <p>In short, Iran is complex. Even to Iranians it seems unfathomable. For foreign governments the message is this: don't expect regime change in the near future. Above all, don't try to force it.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:j.steele@theguardian.com\">j.steele@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>A couple of years ago the physical theatre company Complicite were workshopping their new play when they decided they needed some help. Given that A Disappearing Number (currently playing at the Barbican in London) involves the early 20th-century Cambridge mathematician GH Hardy, and an Indian mathematician he tutored, Srinivasa Ramanujan, they thought they would call on the services of a real live mathematician for their games, so they rang Marcus du Sautoy, a professor of mathematics at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/oxforduniversity\">Oxford</a>, and began their pitch.</p> <p>\"'You probably don't know who we are -'\" Du Sautoy remembers them saying. \"And I said, 'Well, I do, and whenever my maths is going badly, it's you I want to run off and join.'\" In fact, he'd done workshops with them during his undergraduate days at Oxford, and has always loved the fact that Comlipicite don't try \"to replicate real life, they're not trying to create something that you could perhaps do better on film - they're celebrating the space of the theatre. And in a way that appeals to me because it's a bit like doing mathematics. Mathematics is a place where you can do things which you can't do in the real world.\" </p> <p>As is clear from his most recent book, Finding Moonshine, many brilliant mathematicians are rather like we might imagine them to be - eccentric, unworldly, obsessed with train timetables or freakishly large numbers (he tells of one who courted his wife by reciting the expansion of pi; they took it in turns to do 20 decimal places each). Du Sautoy, who plays football, the trumpet, the piano, is a cook and a curious traveller, surfs (\"I count the waves - every seventh one is good\") has a stronger claim on the so-called real world. Yet even he, as he puts it in Finding Moonshine, \"can't step over a starfish in the sea without spinning the pentacle in my head. I can't ignore the strange pattern that adorns my swimming trunks.\" He makes deals with his long-suffering son - a morning looking for symmetry in the British Museum for an afternoon in the skateboard park; a day searching for the 17 possible types of plane symmetry in the Alhambra for shopping in Granada.</p> <p>Du Sautoy, 43, was this week made Charles Simonyi Chair in the Public Understanding of Science at the University of Oxford, and in many ways the post merely formalises what - in the 2006 Royal Institution Christmas Lectures, in his previous book The Music of the Primes, on his current BBC4 show, The Story of Maths - he was doing for his subject already: his particular achievement has been that he is both of mathematics and the world, rather as Complicite are of theatre and the world - interested in making wondrous shapes we can't quite comprehend, but intent on showing them to us anyway, saying, \"Look, isn't it wonderful?\" </p> <p>Well-practised advocate that he is, he also knows that \"of all the sciences, mathematics is the real challenge. People sort of understand the other sciences - what you do, what you're studying, the things, whether it's animals or chemicals, even little particles - but I think for me the challenge is to try and overcome people's antagonism towards mathematics, to show them that mathematics is really part of all the other sciences - you can't do the other sciences without mathematics. It is the language of the sciences, and built the modern world we have today.\" His wife and twin daughters are away on half term, so he is cooking dinner for his 12-year-old son in their cosy kitchen in north London, evangelising over the potatoes. He waves green-and-yellow oven gloves at me; they match, if that's the right word, his pale pink hoodie, lime-green shirt, orange trousers, and shiny blue trainers.</p> <p>\"For me the challenge of the job is to try and communicate that - not to preach to the converted, but to reach the BBC Radio Five Live audience ...\" But shouldn't he start with children? Bored, recalcitrant teenagers? \"I think my primary audience is in some sense an adult audience, because I think that will then have a knock-on effect for children.\" Having said which, he remembers \"a frightening statistic that over half the teachers who teach maths in school don't have a maths degree. That means that they don't really understand what mathematics is about. I think that's one of the problems across the whole of society. People think it's long division to lots of decimal places - but actually, it's something much more exciting.\" </p> <p>And times tables. \"Yeah. Times tables. You know, I'm not terribly fast at my times tables, because that's not what I think mathematics is about. I think it's the same thing as thinking that a good speller will make a great writer. Well, no, actually - great writers can be crap at spelling, but have great vision and ways of bringing stories alive - and I think you've got to put over that mathematics is a similar idea.\" </p> <p>His attitude to key stage 3 - 11- to 14-year-olds, measurably the group most likely to be lost to maths, because they get bored - is to lure them in with familiarity (he has a favourite presentation about why David Beckham chose the number 23 shirt at Real Madrid and Los Angeles Galaxy) then dump them in at the deep end. Though perhaps he wouldn't put it in quite such sadistic terms: he compares his method, rather, to playing music students Beethoven, or giving English students Shakespeare. \"They don't get everything that's going on in Shakespeare, but we're still quite prepared to throw it at them. Well, why aren't we throwing something like the Riemann hypothesis [which would explain how the primes are distributed through the universe of numbers] at them? It's exciting, it's got big ideas, it's got things that you can engage with - although you won't understand the whole thing. That was the mission of my Christmas lectures - to choose a great unsolved problem to lead up to in each lecture, and you know, show them things I don't know how to do. To say, 'I don't understand this, and the goal is for us to try - you're the next generation. You do this.' I think it is possible. It's just we're a bit timid about it.\" </p> <p>Some of it has nothing to do with numbers at all. \"One of the themes in [Finding Moonshine] is about how many of the advances we've made in mathematics are about finding the right language to capture a structure. You know - how do you see in four dimensions? That's something I think you can explain to a kid, and they get quite excited about it - wow! I can see in four dimensions!\" Now we're talking about leaps of faith, aren't we? \"I wouldn't say faith, no - that's a dangerous word, especially in relation to this professorship.\" (This issue is relevant because Richard Dawkins, the previous incumbent is, not to put too fine a point on it, a bit of an atheistic fundamentalist.) \"I think very often the exciting moments in mathematical history are moments when suddenly there's a leap of imagination - for example, the idea of negative numbers, or zero - I mean, that's almost as imaginary as a four-dimensional shape. What's a negative number? I can't show you minus three potatoes - but let's come up with the idea of a negative number and the way that it will behave and explore that. That's why it's a creative subject. It's a lot about creative intuition.\"</p> <p>Du Sautoy once wrote that \"in Einstein's view, the ultimate test for an equation was an aesthetic one. The highest praise for a good theory was not that it was correct or that it was exact, simply that it should be beautiful.\" This doesn't sound particularly scientific to me. \"I think what Einstein was getting at was that mathematics and physics has a lot of beauty in it, and often that's a good motivating force to try and find the right answer. Quite often the answer that you want to discover is probably the most beautiful one - something like Occam's razor, which holds that nature seems to like things that have an in-built simplicity and beauty to them. So in my work, if I look for a direction that I think looks exciting and aesthetically pleasing, often that will be the direction where the right answer lies.\" But isn't that quite a self-fulfilling approach? \"No, because sometimes it's wrong! So for example, there was a theorem - a conjecture - I was working on for 10 years. I thought there was a beautiful symmetry happening in my equations. And I worked for 10 years, trying to prove why it would always be there, and then a student comes along and shows me an example where it didn't have this beautiful symmetry, where it all kind of broke down.\" He claims this discovery had a silver lining, in that he can now explore the new textures it has thrown up; at the time, as he puts it in Finding Moonshine, it was like having \"Oedipus sitting here in my office\". </p> <p>How about the God question? \"Well, I'm an atheist,\" he says, backing away slightly and gripping the kitchen counter. \"When people ask me what my religion is, I say it's the Arsenal. That's my kind of irrational ...\" But all this talk of beauty and nature, surely that's just as irrational? Apparently not. \"Because we have the power of proof - I can prove with 100% certainty that there are infinitely many primes, and nobody's going to question that. And that is, I think, why I was drawn to mathematics out of all the sciences. What the Greeks proved 2,000 years ago is as true today as it was 2,000 years ago. And actually - when I look through the history of my subject, very often you find that mathematicians have had quite tough childhoods, and have been drawn to mathematics as a place of security, as something that's not going to break down. That's an appealing side to the subject.\"</p> <p>Du Sautoy was not a maths-as-party trick kind of child; he has said that his parents were told not to bother entering him for selective schools because he couldn't spell or do times tables. Like countless small boys he wanted to be James Bond; unlike countless small boys, he had a mother who had worked at the foreign office (an inventive, artistic woman, she spun this out, pretending she had a little black gun hidden somewhere in the house). So he tried to learn languages, but they infuriated him by refusing to behave logically. It was only when a discerning maths teacher noticed he liked patterns and started recommending books to him that he found his metier. One especially, A Mathematician's Apology by GH Hardy, which was about the business of \"being a mathematician - and it brought out the aesthetic side, the creative side. It kept on comparing maths to writing poetry. And it had two little proofs in there. One why there are infinitely many primes, and one why the square root of two is not a fraction, and they were just so beautiful, and turned you on!\" His voice goes a little squeaky. \"You suddenly could prove things about infinity! You know? That's amazing!\"</p> <p>After an undergraduate degree at Oxford he entered All Souls, where, as Matthew d'Ancona, then also a fellow, wrote last week, he stuck out because he \"liked the Happy Mondays and New Order ... dressed like a student, had changeable hair colour, was a great cook, loved music and Arsenal, and spent his evenings at theatre workshops.\" Du Sautoy has compared All Souls to being like \"living in a 1920s novel. I was dining in college every night, fine wines, headache in the morning.\" It was too rarefied; he left for the Hebrew University in Israel, where more people study what he does: primes, and group theory, the study of what symmetries are possible. Essentially, he spends his days envisioning shapes twisting through hyperspace, in up to 196,883 dimensions - in fact, into infinity. (Donate a minimum of $10 to the Guatemalan street-kids' charity Common Hope, and he'll name a symmetry he discovers after you.) </p> <p>In Israel he met his wife, Shani, who thought the fact that he was learning Arabic and spending all his time in East Jerusalem rather funny; she was then a website designer and is now a trained psychologist. He works at home, in his counter-intuitively messy office (he finds searching for things helps him make connections). He doesn't do long hours, because he finds his work exhausting. \"I can often be squirming around so much in my chair trying to work out what's going on that I've probably ended up running, you know, 10km by the end of the day.\" Most of it gets scribbled down on yellow legal pads, rather than entered into a computer, \"because actually, when you're trying to explore the infinite, a computer isn't terribly helpful\". </p> <p>And in fact he finds the infinite consoling. His eldest son, Tomer, calls, and as we stride out across Stoke Newington to meet the school bus, past dog-walking hoodies, women returning from work, a grey-bearded Hasid carefully cycling along a dark park, he talks about the child they lost, at term; the fact that Shani was then in a coma for two weeks and no longer able to have children. \"It was like a bomb going off in our lives. Nobody was able to provide a rational explanation of what the hell had happened. And that I found very difficult to deal with. So I did the classic male thing of just hiding in my subject. And I found the security of what I do very reassuring.\" Surrogacy didn't work so they adopted, twin girls from Guatemala who are now five. </p> <p>Mathematics (as he almost always calls it, as opposed to maths) may not explain everything in life, but he considers it his mission to show how it is involved in nearly everything: on the way back we talk about how jazz musicians play with time, and infinite divisions of time; how Fibonacci numbers were first discovered not by Fibonacci, but by Indian musicians, \"because actually these numbers describe the number of different rhythm patterns you can make with long and short beats\". He often works with composer Dorothy Ker; for the last three years they have collaborated on a piece of experimental music in which, as Ker puts it, \"we imagine a four-dimensional space through paths of movement, sound structures and projected imagery\" and combined it with an interpretation of Borges' The Library of Babel; The 19th Step was performed early this year. We discuss the mathematical models beloved of hedge-fund managers, the maths involved in predicting the weather - the degree to which to understand mathematics is to wield a very real-world kind of power. As well, of course, as in more esoteric realms. He once referred to the \"arrogant superior manner that mathematicians can have about truth, as if they alone are its custodians\". He laughs. \"Gosh, did I say that? Um - well, I think there is something about the power of proof, that you can be so confident in it. I think there are very few other areas, even other sciences, where you can be so certain about something. So yeah - I think it does give you confidence in what you know. That's important to me, as I said. I don't like things where I can't pin down what's happened. I like the power of mathematics to take you from a place that you're happy with to a new place which is unexpected, but you're still totally certain that it's true\".</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Audio: </strong>Marcus du Sautoy on the Simonyi professorship <a href=\"http://theguardian.com/science\">theguardian.com/science</a></p>"
