  "<p>Mike Davis has constructed this book more precisely than his other recent works on the disintegration of the world's social and ecological contracts. He sums up the development of asymmetric warfare in a cool one-page chronology, tabulating innovations from the horse and cart that detonated on Wall Street in 1920, through to 9/11 (\"car bombs with wings\") and a guerrilla war in Iraq principally waged through exploding motors. He has strictly disciplined himself to pack the maximum density of facts into a small volume, so there's minimum editorialising; extreme violence blows away any melodrama. And he calibrates the increments in kinetic force and the advances in political and strategic deployment (for example, the 1993 IRA London blasts that were intended to devastate the international reinsurance business, and did). His tone sounds more furiously calm with each campaign, as the car bomb - so cheap, efficient and simple - expands into a global deterrent, the unanswerable weapon that \"gives claws to the weak\".</p>",
  "<h2>More senior moments in the railcard debate</h2> <p>I have never laughed out loud when reading Your Shout before but when I saw the conclusion to Chris Chapman's letter (August 9) complaining of having to pay a penalty fare when he forgot his senior railcard, I could not contain myself. </p> <p>\"I am left with the impression the rail companies' only interest is to make as much money as they can.\" D'oh!<br><strong>Chris Renn</strong><br>Donington, Lincs </p> <p>On a recent round trip between Nottingham and Fleet in Hants, I used my senior railcard to purchase tickets costing \u00a327.70. Only on the final leg of the journey was I asked to show my railcard. I had forgotten it so was refused access to the train and sent to the ticket office to buy a new ticket. There was a queue so not only did I have to spend a further \u00a349.70 to get home but I missed the train I was booked on and arrived home much later and poorer than planned.</p> <p>I, too, wrote to the rail company concerned, East Midlands Trains, enclosing a copy of my valid railcard, but here our experiences differ. </p> <p>I received a letter of apology, a refund of \u00a349.70 and a description of plans to ensure a more consistent ticket and railcard checking procedure in the future. </p> <p>On time, clean and comfortable - and fair to its passengers - a lesson for the Norwich to London line?<br><strong>Tony Stafford,</strong> <br>Nottingham </p> <p>The deal on the trains is that a discounted fare is offered with a valid railcard. A condition is that the railcard must be carried at the time of travel. If Chris Chapman had forgotten his when he travelled then he breached the conditions of the ticket and is consequently liable for the full fare. It really is that simple and the message is clear: do not forget your railcard.<br><strong>Peter Salter,</strong><br>London</p> <p>Why is Chris Chapman left with merely \"an impression\" that \"the rail companies' only interest is to make as much money as they can\"?</p> <p>As he holds a senior railcard, he is old enough to remember that these companies are the product of the Conservative government's privatisation programme - the purpose of such programme being to provide rich, and subsidised, pickings for their corporate and wealthy supporters at the expense of the rest of us, and certainly not a public service.<br><strong>George Redman, </strong><br>London, SE9 </p> <h2>Why is no one called to account for this greed?</h2> <p>As I read Patrick Collinson's article on self-certification mortgages (On Reflection, August 9), I could not help but reflect on the hoops my wife and I had to go through as teachers in 1965 to obtain a mortgage on the basis of what was considered to be a reliable formula of 90% of the value of the property and not more than three times our annual earnings - with some reservation as to whether the building society was prepared to take into account my wife's earnings. </p> <p>I have followed the saga of Northern Rock's collapse; the sheer greedy foolhardiness of specialist finance people being so ready to provide 125% mortgages; then your information about these \"specialist lenders\" and the investment banks. </p> <p>And still no one is called to account. </p> <p>Senior people at Northern Rock, taking huge bonuses that make a little household burglary seem irrelevant, walk away scot-free. </p> <p>It is difficult to understand how governments have been prepared even to countenance this level of irresponsibility and greed. Yet they have encouraged it. </p> <p>Where did it all go wrong? Who is going to be brave enough to turn the clock back after so much demutualisation and the City slickers being regarded as the nation's heroes? <br><strong>Malcolm Matthews, </strong><br>Nottingham </p> <p>The self-certification mortgage is indeed a hilarious concept, but take a look at the Guardian's website. At the foot of the Money homepage is an ad for an outfit offering loans to those with bad credit, county court judgments, etc. </p> <p>But full marks for stating the bleedin' obvious about Northern Rock - that it should be returned to mutuality and not to the kind of spivs who buggered it up in the first place. <br><strong>Root Cartwright, </strong><br>via email </p> <h2>It's easy to fall for the high-pressure scam</h2> <p>Richard Cooper is too hard on the victims of lottery scams, boiler rooms, etc (Your Shout, August 9). One does not have to be greedy or dishonest to fall for the persuasive, high-pressure lies that salespeople often tell; one just has to have a trusting nature that has not been hardened by previous scams. It is experience and cynicism that stops me falling for things, not a superior moral nature. </p> <p>The government should come down hard on con artists: they ruin people's lives and they should face imprisonment, not merely fines.<br><strong>Richard Mountford,</strong> <br>Tonbridge, Kent </p> <h2>Company right to stall on car insurance claim </h2> <p>Your correspondent (August 9) admits having failed to disclose a relevant fact when applying for car insurance, then failing to do so at every renewal. He has thus benefited from cheaper car insurance for several years and now seems to be cross he has been caught.<br><strong>Tony Evans,</strong><br>Hove </p> <h2>Whatever happened to the service template?</h2> <p>I read with surprise in Your Shout (August 9) that Royal Mail refused to send a cardboard measuring template to a customer who had requested one, instead referring the person to the company that makes the expensive Perspex version. </p> <p>Excellent customer service from Royal Mail, once again.</p> <p>Postwatch, the consumer council for postal services, was involved in the implementation of the new system in August 2006, during which we received several hundred measuring templates to issue to customers on our UK-wide information programme, or to send out whenever customers requested them.</p> <p>You may print my contact details should you wish to do so, informing customers that a limited stock of templates are available should they require one. </p> <p>However, they'll need to hurry - Postwatch is due to be wound up on September 30. </p> <p>I will also raise the matter with Royal Mail because it really should have a stock of templates for instances such as this.</p> <p><strong>Jerome Mallon, policy manager, </strong><br>Postwatch <a href=\"mailto:Jerome.Mallon@postwatch.co.uk\">Jerome.Mallon@postwatch.co.uk</a> </p> <h2>Luring new customers at expense of old ones</h2> <p>Please warn your readers about the banks' and building societies' continuing practice of bringing out new issues of existing savings accounts. My bank, Anglo Irish, has just brought out a second issue of its Easy Access account. </p> <p>We have two accounts with them and if I hadn't noticed their interest rate increase to 6.4% in your paper, I would have been none the wiser. Although I read the Guardian and the Observer, I have seen no notice of this new issue. To change over to this higher interest rate one has to phone up and order application forms, and R85 tax exemption forms. </p> <p>This is obviously a ploy to discourage existing customers from obtaining the higher rate and is nothing short of a con. <br><strong>John Driscoll,</strong><br>Honiton, Devon</p> <h2>Red light on bank's Green Flag cover </h2> <p>Having seen reports alerting people to the financial inefficiency in paying extra for premium bank accounts and not actually using any of the services in the package, I decided to downgrade because I was paying \u00a312.95 every month and not benefiting. </p> <p>When I mentioned this to my bank, I was told: \"Hang on, you're paying for the AA when you've already got Green Flag with us, and it's \u00a315 a year cheaper.\"</p> <p>So I decided to stay with the premium account because it included Green Flag's roadside assistance. </p> <p>Last week, on the way from Wiltshire to my home in Wales, my car died on me, leaving me stranded in the thunder and lightning on the hard shoulder of the M4. </p> <p>I phoned Green Flag and I told the man I was 23 miles from the Severn Bridge on the English side, and which service station I had just left. </p> <p>But that was not good enough. I was told to walk up the motorway and find the next junction or emergency phone. I then received a call to say they would be there in 60 minutes - in all fairness, they were there in 30 minutes. </p> <p>However, once in the recovery vehicle, I was informed that I am only covered under my bank's policy for a 10-mile radius.</p> <p>I had to leave my car with a garage in Chippenham. They kindly dropped me off at Leigh Delamare services, from where I had to ring my son to pick me up. </p> <p>The following day I went to the bank to complain that I had been misled. They were very nice but pointed out that all information concerning Green Flag was sent to me alongside any bank statements. </p> <p>I pointed out that this was junk mail and, anyway, who reads junk mail? </p> <p>I did, however, manage to get a refund of three months' payments for my premium bank account. </p> <p>Drivers beware. <br><strong>Irene Brown, </strong><br>south Wales</p>",
  "<p>Pity Georgia's bedraggled first infantry brigade. And its second. And its hapless navy.</p> <p>For the past few evenings in the foothills of the Southern Caucasus on the outskirts of Joseph Stalin's hometown of Gori, reconnaissance units of Russia's 58th army have been raking through the spoils of war at what was the Georgian army's pride and joy, a shiny new military base inaugurated only last January for the first infantry, the army engineers, and an artillery brigade.</p> <p>A couple of hours to the west, in the town of Senaki, it's the same picture. A flagship military base, home to the second infantry brigade, is in Russian hands. And down on the Black Sea coast, the radars and installations for Georgia's sole naval base at Poti have been scrupulously pinpointed by the Russians and destroyed.</p> <p>Gori and Senaki are not ramshackle relics of the old Red Army of the type that litter the landscape of eastern Europe. \"These bases have only recently been upgraded to Nato standard,\" said Matthew Clements, Eurasia analyst at Jane's Information Group. \"They have been operationally targeted to seriously degrade the Georgian military.\"</p> <p>\"There is a presence of our armed forces near Gori and Senaki. We make no secret of it,\" said the general staff in Moscow. \"They are there to defuse an enormous arsenal of weapons and military hardware which have been discovered in the vicinity of Gori and Senaki without any guard whatsoever.\"</p> <p>The \"enormous arsenals\" are American-made or American-supplied. American money, know-how, planning, and equipment built these bases as part of Washington's drive to bring Nato membership to a small country that is Russia's underbelly.</p> <p>The American \"train and equip\" mission for the Georgian military is six years old. It has been destroyed in as many days. And with it, Georgia's Nato ambitions. \"There are a few countries that will say 'told you so'\" about the need to get Georgia into Nato,\" said Andrew Wilson, Russia expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations. \"But many more will want to walk away from the problem. And for the next few years, Georgia will be far too busy trying to pick itself up.\"</p> <p>If Georgia and Nato are the principal casualties of this week's ruthless display of brute power by Vladimir Putin, the consequences are bigger still, the fallout immense, if uncertain. The regional and the global balance of power looks to have tilted, against the west and in favour of the rising or resurgent players of the east.</p> <p>In a seminal speech in Munich last year, Putin confidently warned the west that he would not tolerate the age of American hyperpower. Seven years in office at the time and at the height of his powers, he delivered his most anti-western tirade </p> <p><strong>Pernicious</strong></p> <p>To an audience that included John McCain, the White House contender, and Robert Gates, the US defence secretary and ex-Kremlinologist, he served notice: \"What is a unipolar world? It refers to one type of situation, one centre of authority, one centre of force, one centre of decision-making. It is world in which there is one master, one sovereign. This is pernicious ... unacceptable ... impossible.\"</p> <p>This week, he turned those words into action, demonstrating the limits of US power with his rout of Georgia. His forces roamed at will along the roads of the Southern Caucasus, beyond Russia's borders for the first time since the disastrous Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s.</p> <p>As the Russian officers sat on the American stockpiles of machine guns, ammunition, and equipment in Gori, they were savouring a highly unusual scenario. Not since the Afghan war had the Russians seized vast caches of US weaponry. \"People are sick to the stomach in Washington,\" said a former Pentagon official. And the Russians are giddy with success.</p> <p>Celebrating the biggest victory in eight years of what might be termed Putinism, the dogged pursuit by whatever means to avenge a long period of Russian humiliation and to deploy his limited range of levers - oil, gas, or brute force - to make the world listen to Moscow, the Russian prime minister has redrawn the geopolitical map.</p> <p>In less than a week, Putin has invaded another country, effectively partitioned Georgia in a lightning campaign, weakened his arch-enemy, President Mikheil Saakashvili, divided the west, and presented a fait accompli. The impact - locally, regionally, and globally - is huge.</p> <p>\"The war in Georgia has put the European order in question,\" said Alexander Rahr, one of Germany's leading Russia experts and a Putin biographer. \"The times are past when you can punish Russia.\"</p> <p>That seems to be the view among leading European policymakers who have been scrambling all week to arrange and shore up a fragile ceasefire, risking charges of appeasing the Kremlin.</p> <p>\"Don't ask us who's good and who's bad here,\" said Bernard Kouchner, the French foreign minister, after shuttling between Tbilisi and Moscow to try to halt the violence. \"We shouldn't make any moral judgments on this war. Stopping the war, that's what we're interested in.\"</p> <p>His boss, President Nicolas Sarkozy, went to the Kremlin to negotiate a ceasefire and parade as a peacemaker. Critics said he acted as Moscow's messenger, noting Putin's terms then taking them to Tbilisi to persuade </p> <p>Saakashvili to capitulate. Germany also refused to take sides while Italy warned against building an \"anti-Moscow coalition\".</p> <p>That contrasted with Gordon Brown's and David Milliband's talk of Russian \"aggression\" and Condoleezza Rice's arrival in Tbilisi yesterday to rally \"the free world behind a free Georgia\".</p> <p>The effects of Putin's coup are first felt locally and around Russia's rim. \"My view is that the Russians, and I would say principally prime minister Putin, is interested in reasserting Russia's, not only Russia's great power or superpower status, but in reasserting Russia's traditional spheres of influence,\" said Gates. \"My guess is that everyone is going to be looking at Russia through a different set of lenses as we look ahead.\" </p> <p>In Kiev certainly. Ukraine's pro-western prime minister, Viktor Yushchenko, Saaksahvili's fellow colour-revolutionary, is chastened and wary. His firebrand anti-Russian prime minister, Yuliya Tymoshenko, has gone uncharacteristically quiet.</p> <p><strong>Invasion</strong></p> <p>\"An invasion of Ukraine by 'peacekeeping tanks' is just a question of time,\" wrote Aleksandr Sushko, director of Kiev's Institute of Euro-Atlantic Cooperation. \"Weimar Russia is completing its transformation into something else. If Russia wins this war, a new order will take shape in Europe which will have no place for Ukraine as a sovereign state.\"</p> <p>All around Russia's rim, the former Soviet \"captive states\" are trembling. Even Belarus, the slavishly loyal \"last dictatorship in Europe\", went strangely silent, taking days before the regime offered Moscow its support. \"Everybody's nervous,\" said Wilson.</p> <p>The EU states of the Baltic and Poland are drumming up support for Georgia, with the Polish president Lech Kaczynski declaring that Russia has revealed \"its true face\". That divides the EU since the French and the Germans refuse to take sides and are scornful of east European \"hysteria\" towards Russia. Rahr in Berlin says the German and French governments are striving to keep the Poles and the Baltic states well away from any EU-led peace negotiations. It was the Germans and the French who, in April, blunted George Bush's drive to get Georgia into Nato. They will also resist potential US moves to kick Russia out of the G8 or other international bodies.</p> <p>There are many who argue that Putin's gamble will backfire, that he has bitten off more than he can chew, that Russia remains weak, a \"Saudi Arabia with trees\" in the words of Robert Hunter, the former US ambassador to Nato.</p> <p>Compared to the other rising powers of China, India or even Brazil - the companions referred to as the BRIC - Russia does indeed appear weak. Its economy struggles to develop goods or services, depends on raw material exports and on European consumption and the price of oil for its current wealth.</p> <p><strong>Resources</strong></p> <p>But Putin's talent is for playing a weak hand well, maximising and concentrating his limited resources, and creating facts on the ground while the west dithers.</p> <p>\"There is a lack of a clear and unified European policy towards Russia,\" said Clements. In the crucial contest over energy \"the Russian strategy of keeping control of exports and supply is outpacing any European response\".</p> <p>Putin may now calculate he can call off the dogs of war, having achieved his aims and able to pocket his gains very cheaply. The Georgia campaign becomes the triumphant climax of Putinism.</p> <p>\"In politics, it is very important to know one's measure,\" wrote Aleksey Arbatov, director of Moscow's International Security Centre. \"If Russia continues to inflict strikes on Georgian territory, on facilities, on population centres, we may lose the moral supremacy we have today.\"</p> <p>But Wilson and many in eastern Europe worry that rather than being the climax of Putinism, the Russians in Georgia signal the start of something else. \"This may not be a culmination, but only step one,\" said Wilson. \"If you don't stop this kind of behaviour, it escalates.\"</p>",

It's a simple deal - one man sits in the hut, reading a book, then jumps up, stuffs your flatbread full of just-done falafel and salad (the green chilli sauce is only for the brave) then sits down to read his book again. </p> <h2>Aziz</h2> <p><strong>228-230 Cowley Road, Oxford, 01865 794945</strong></p> <p>Before I moved out of London, my vote for best Indian restaurant in the world went to my local, Bawarchi, in Kensal Rise.

  "<p>Merrill Lynch could avoid paying tax in the UK for decades thanks to $29bn (\u00a316bn) of losses made on its toxic investments through its London subsidiary.</p> <p>The impact on the Treasury's coffers is the latest illustration of the impact the credit crunch is having on the wider economy and has led to concerns about the reduction in tax receipts on the government's fragile finances.</p> <p>Banks are a crucial contributor to the public finances. National Audit Office data for the 2005-06 financial year - the most recent available - show that banks were the biggest payers of corporation tax, at \u00a37bn. Contributors included the high street banks and UK operations of Wall Street firms now hit by the credit crunch.</p> <p>The impact of shrinking bank profits on tax receipts may become apparent in the pre-budget report this autumn when the Treasury publishes estimates of the public finances.</p> <p>Bill Dodwell, head of tax policy at accountants Deliotte, said: \"The good news is they have been collecting more corporation tax from the oil sector, but who knows if that is going to compensate for the losses by the banks?\"</p> <p>In the first half of the year, the profits of the high street banks listed in London were down \u00a314bn on the same period in 2007, which will affect their tax bills, set at the end of the financial year. For the first six months of last year the banks expected to pay taxes of more than \u00a35bn, but their latest figures indicate that will be \u00a31bn. </p> <p>Under UK law, a loss can be carried forward indefinitely until the company has made as much in profit as it has losses. According to accounts filed at Companies House this month, Merrill Lynch made \u00a37.4bn of losses in the year to end-December, compared with a profit of \u00a3393m the previous year. </p> <p>After the financial year end, the accounts show the firm recorded exceptional write-downs of \u00a35.5bn related to investments that have turned toxic in the credit crunch, taking the total loss to almost \u00a313bn. Further losses are revealed in a US regulatory filing, taking the total loss to \u00a316bn. Merrill could record further losses on the collateralised debt obligations - complex instruments at the core of its losses - which will also be booked through London.</p> <p>Merrill Lynch yesterday took steps to attempt to return to profitability by announcing a hiring freeze. In a memo from New York head office signed by Gregory Fleming, president and chief operating officer, and Thomas Sanzone, chief administrative officer, the bank said only financial advisers were immune from the ruling on headcount.</p> <p>\"A global hiring freeze will be in place for the remainder of the year. This freeze covers any incremental hires including previously approved budgeted hires and replacement hires. This policy does not apply to financial advisers or client associates who the firm will continue to recruit and hire in line with business plans.</p> <p>\"Typically, the majority of the firm's hiring occurs during the first and second quarters of the year with the third and fourth quarters progressively tapering off,\" the memo said.</p>",

  "<p>For environmental campaigners who are also republicans, the Prince of Wales is a bit of a thorn in the flesh. He's involved in just about all the principal issues - championing organic agriculture, supporting local produce, rainforest campaigning, and sounding off about GM foods. Whereas in the past it might have been possible to ignore him as an eccentric fellow traveller, these days his views often sound so like those of the leading environmental NGOs, that increasingly they are having to ask themselves: does he know what he's talking about? Is he an asset or a liability? </p> <p>This questioning is likely to become more insistent over the coming year. Prince Charles turns 60 in November and some people will ask more loudly than before: what is an ageing prince for? Insofar as he asks himself the same question, it seems that focussing on the environment is the answer. Last year he set up Rainforests Project, giving himself a year to come up with action to save the rainforests. The man, whose main role was ticking off politicians and newspaper editors in letters written in green ink, seems to be finally settling on a role as the environmental conscience of the nation.</p> <p>It is easy to mock Prince Charles - and large sections of the media have done so in the wake of his latest outburst, earlier this week, on GM food. He has a strange, strangulated, plummy accent. He tends towards hyperbole, on this occasion describing GM crops as \"the biggest disaster, environmentally, of all time\". He often looks and sounds silly, as when he sung the praises of \"wibbly wobbly carrots\", while dressed in ancient tweeds and carrying a shepherd's crook. And he famously loses his temper, becoming more and more like his irascible father with every passing year. According to Jeff Randall, the Daily Telegraph journalist who interviewed him on this occasion, Prince Charles \"jabbed\" at him with his finger and was \"bouncing in his chair\" while setting out \"his nightmare vision\", a world in which millions of small farmers \"are driven off their land [by global conglomerates] into unsustainable, unmanageable, degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness\". Out of context, that statement rivals his views on nanotechnology a few years ago - comments which came to be known as his \"grey goo\" moment after he apparently spoke of the horror of such technology turning the world to grey goo.</p> <p>But even though many newspapers wheeled out scientists to denounce Prince Charles as \"unscientific\", he has garnered significant support. Several commentators noted that in fact the scientific community was far from united in support of GM crops, while Patrick Holden, the director of the Soil Association, rallied to support his seriousness and expertise. The Daily Mail, consistent in its hostility to GM \"Frankenstein foods\", said Prince Charles had \"put forward serious arguments that need to be heard and struck a resounding chord with the public\". </p> <p>\"His comments are being misrepresented,\" says journalist Felicity Lawrence. \"He was actually talking at the time about how to support local food producers in Scotland, something he knows a lot about. I suspect his explosion about farmers going to live in horrible cities wasn't like his denunciation of the modern UK city along the lines of his 'hideous carbuncle' speech, it was addressing how, if you pursue further industrialisation of agriculture, it inevitably means growers are displaced from the land and will end up in mega slums. This isn't wild fantasy. It's describing what is happening.\" </p> <p>No one doubts Prince Charles's commitment to the environment. It has been a lifelong passion - sometimes derided, as when he famously announced that he always talked to his plants, but often prescient. He set up a natural filter bed and water recycling system at Highgrove in Gloucestershire long before most people were aware of the need to conserve water. His Rainforests Project makes explicit his desire to make an impact in his 60th year on what he considers the world's most pressing problem: deforestation. But the cause to which he remains closest is promoting organic food production and small-scale local farming. He's been an organic farmer since the 1980's, and set up the highly profitable Duchy Originals in 1992. An organic food company, it helps small farmers find new markets for their goods while promoting more sustainable production. </p> <p>\"He has many interests,\" says Paddy Harverson, his communications secretary. \"But farming is right at the top not least because he's a farmer. He spends a lot of time on Home Farm in Gloucestershire and takes an immense interest in contemporary farming. This year he is Patron of the Year of Food and Farming and most small farmers would see him as a friend and advocate.</p> <p>\"The Daily Telegraph interview was given to highlight The North Highland Initiative. That's one of the four or five initiatives he has set up to help farmers' products become more competitive by using imaginative marketing solutions.\"</p> <p>The prince's interest in food and food production is one of the main reasons he is once again mired in political controversy. The current food crisis, say critics of the food industry, has allowed the supporters of GM to come rushing back into government circles offering biotechnology as a solution. His spokespeople are keen to insist that debating issues of food production and food security are not political but social and environmental. But as the global food crisis moves centre stage and politicians position themselves, that distinction will be harder to maintain. Could Prince Charles become more than a royal mascot for the greens? His seriousness is not in dispute but does he have the depth of understanding to be a spokesman environmentalists would be happy to line up behind? </p> <p>\"Was he talking nonsense?\" says Andrew Simms, the policy director at the New Economics Foundation. \"No, but I think he was overstating it. If someone asked me what was the most serious issue affecting the environment at the moment I'd say climate change rather than biotechnology. Biotechnology is a very important issue. There are lots of scientific and health issues connected with it that are still unanswered. But the most important issue about biotechnology is that the vast majority of applications which have come out of research into GM have had nothing to solving the problems of poverty, hunger and food security and everything to do with extending the control which agri-business has over the food chain.\" </p> <p>According to Simms, tackling food security and hunger necessarily entail issues of social justice and redistribution. \"If you do ask how to go about solving those issues, biotechnology would be quite low down. Higher up would be solutions such as giving people more entitlement to the land, land reform, redirecting agricultural extension services to small farmers, and looking at a wide range of sustainable farming techniques which don't rely on invasive high technology approaches but build on farmers' existing knowledge.\" </p> <p>And if the real solutions to food security and sustainable food production entail equitable redistribution, where does Prince Charles - a person of immense, almost unimaginable privilege, stand on these issues? \"What is really interesting\" says Lawrence, \"is that he's talking about corporate control and its effect on agriculture. It's not exactly leftwing but it is radical. I would place him in that tradition of philanthropic, experimental landowners like Robert Owen, who does things in a patriarchal and paternalistic way but genuinely wants to leave the world a better place.\" </p> <p>There are other examples of this kind of paternalistic philanthropy in Britain, including around food production. Mac Fisheries was set up by William Hesketh Lever, one of the Lever Brothers, in the early 1920s as an attempt to guarantee work for the fishing community on and around the Isle of Harris. </p> <p>It may also be the case that environmental issues are recasting the old left/right divisions. Figures such as Zac Goldsmith, Peter Melchett, Jonathan Porritt and even David Cameron - people who might all fit the description \"radical toffs\" - are involved in causes which could easily bring them into conflict with the activities of big corporations. But even if old alignments are changing there is a long way to go to overcome most people's ambivalence about embracing Prince Charles as a green superhero or even as a spokesman. </p> <p>\"He says he's concerned,\" says Simms. \"But he doesn't strike me as being too concerned about poverty and poverty reduction.\" Others would be harsher. Ken Wharfe, the former royal protection officer for Princess Diana who had the opportunity to observe the prince at first hand, says: \"The point is that Charles, for all his current 'voice of the people' role, is someone whose life is wrapped in cotton wool, where every whim is catered for and not challenged. </p> <p>\"I remember leaving Balmoral one evening with the Prince of Wales in a convoy of four vehicles, suddenly to be instructed to return immediately to the castle. Fearing a real emergency I asked why, he told me that he had left an electric light on, and not to turn it off would be a terrible waste of electricity. So the whole convoy returned to extinguish the light. I don't begrudge the Prince of Wales his reed and lily bed for the natural recycling of liquid waste. It's just that no one seems to notice how totally at odds it is with all the devotion to detail and excess which is the hallmark of his life at Highgrove.\"</p> <p>\"Prince Charles is who he is and says what he says. And that's fine\" adds Simms. \"But I don't think he should stand as a spokesperson for the broader environmental and social justice system. The trouble is we are trapped in a celebrity culture and royalty is part of that. There are many voices out there possibly more suited to speak - people who know more about the issues in greater depth and from the perspective of global justice. But it's a celebrity system and celebrities crowd out more informed voices.\"</p>",
  "<p>A hot midday on a hillside overlooking Ramallah, a blue sky with some bashful, short-lived clouds and Palestinian flags everywhere, side by side with his photo - and the voice of Mahmoud Darwish reciting his own poetry came pure and powerful through the huge loudspeakers and covered the whole landscape. In the middle of the courtyard of Ramallah's Cultural Palace, where he'd given his last poetry reading a few weeks ago (at which he read \"The Dice Player\"), the empty grave was waiting for the body of the poet. The roads up the hill carried wave after wave of people of all ages and affiliations, all trying hard to get as close as possible to the grave to say goodbye to their poet. As the coffin was lowered into the ground, a small regiment of Palestinian security officers had to restrain a crowd struggling to look at the grave, and another fired 21 shots in salute. </p> <p>We circled around the grave, and I found myself next to his mother, Houria, aged 92 - who was brought from Galilee in an ambulance and brought on a wheelchair to have a last glance at her boy, whose most famous line is \"I yearn for my mother's bread and my mother's coffee\" - and his two brothers, Ahmad and Zaki. I saw his sisters only after the ceremony was over. The family was almost apologetic for their presence among those thousands of mourners; his mother, in her feeble, broken voice, said: \"He is the son of all of you.\" This was the first time I had seen his mother. She does not travel, and I am not allowed to go to Galilee.</p> <p>Earlier in the day, just before 10am, Darwish's body arrived on a flight from the United States in Amman, Jordan. After a short ceremony the casket was loaded on to a Jordanian military helicopter, which flew to Ramallah, landing at noon. Far from Ramallah, a procession left the Ahihud junction, east of Acre, heading towards the former village of Al-Birweh, where Darwish was born. A symbolic funeral was held there, as youths recited Darwish's poems. What an embarrassment to those who accuse the Palestinians of all sorts of evil. Now you have thousands and thousands of Palestinians with poems and roses in their hands, going out to honour a poet whose lines are full of butterflies, doves, bees, ancient mythology and biblical allusions. They are out for beautiful verse, and that's it. This is praise for them and also for their poet, who proved to them only through his aesthetic experiments the value of art and its charms. Those are the same people who filled halls and theatres and auditoriums to listen to him. Many more people like them in most of the Arab countries were no less enthusiastic. In 2002, an audience of 25,000 Lebanese and Palestinians living in the refugee camps of Lebanon filled a football stadium in Beirut to listen for three hours to his fascinating words. Occupation and dictatorship do everything possible to suppress their victims' desire for any kind of self-expression. But the victims do express themselves: they do it politically, through acts of resistance, and culturally, through songs, folk dances, handicrafts, memoirs and poems. By self-expression they achieve self-assertion, and this makes them stronger and guards them against self-pity and sentimentality. This explains the precious unwritten contract between Palestinian and Arab writers, as masters of expression, and their audience.</p> <p>Darwish gave them this without sacrificing his self-imposed aesthetic ambitions and rules. I think it is safe to say that this is what distinguished him among Arab poets. But Darwish did not come out of nowhere, and his absence will not be the end of excellent Palestinian poetry. This land needs its poets and will always have them.</p> <p>Long ago Darwish had walked out of professional politics, out of his literary quarterly Al Karmil, out of two very brief, almost unpublicised, childless marriages. From August 9 2008, Mahmoud, as we used to call him, will live among us as pure poetry, exactly as he'd always wished.</p> <p>I phoned him from Cairo just before what turned out to be his final trip, and he told me he knew the risks of failed surgery in his case: paralysis or death. \"I can accept death,\" he said. Now his famous shyness will not prevent him from accepting our invitation to stay with us a bit longer; he will walk freely in our reading hours and our bedrooms. </p> <p>The story of the Palestinian people since their nakba is a story of unfulfilled desires: the desire for normal life, for justice, for national independence and freedom, but even Mahmoud had to come to this cheerless conclusion: \"I thought poetry could change everything, could change history and could humanise, and I think that the illusion is very necessary to push poets to be involved and to believe. But now I think that poetry changes only the poet.\"</p> <p>This time he was wrong. This man's poetry has changed the language of Arabic writing and shifted readers' conceptions of resistance poetry. The drums receded to give way to the harp and the flute. Single-coloured khaki poems full of slogans gave way to rainbow-intertwined shades. Even the physical image of the victimised and the oppressed had to give way to Mahmoud's unmatched elegance in dress and in daily conversation alike.</p> <p>As a poet, he had that overwhelming presence of an elderly figure, while as a person he was like the beloved youngest son in the family, a polite and vulnerable grandson, for whom you are tempted to do anything to protect him from harm. In this world of polluted international political language, where the word \"freedom\" is abused in every manner, referring to everything from capitalism to the occupation of Iraq, Mahmoud's poetry and life were an attempt to give it back its meaning. This was his destiny because he was a poet, and also because he was an Arab and a Palestinian. </p> <p>Born in Al-Birweh, a Palestinian village in northern Galilee that was completely destroyed by the Zionist militias that built the state of Israel in 1948, he fled the country with his family, only to return in secret to live in an adjacent Arab village that had escaped destruction. Like those Arab Palestinians who stayed in the state of Israel, he lived under military rule, confiscation of lands and constraints on movement until 1966. He therefore joined the only non-Zionist political party in Israel, the Israeli Communist party. For many Arabs, their class and national identities were congruent; they were poor and oppressed, because they were Arabs. </p> <p>Belonging to a political party, however, brings its own constraints. The choice offered to Mahmoud, like that historically offered to many of his people, is a choice between shackles and shackles: a choice between the shackles of occupation and the shackles of resisting it. In the early 1970s he decided to leave. He went to Egypt and then to Lebanon. In a press conference in Cairo, he said: \"I changed my place, but not my position.\" He left Palestine, to join the Palestine Liberation Organisation.</p> <p>Here is another paradox that Mahmoud shares with his people: in the Arab world, Palestinians are in exile, but they are not strangers. Mahmoud's life in Egypt, and later in Lebanon, was not a disconnection from Palestine - rather, it made him more of a pan-Arab poet, which in turn made him more of a Palestinian one. </p> <p>Mahmoud was at the centre of Arab culture in the 20th century because he was a poet, and a Palestinian. Poetry lies at the centre of all Arab arts, and Palestine at the centre of Arab collective consciousness. A poem about Palestine was therefore a poem to all Arabs.</p> <p>Among the many arts that the Arabs have produced without interruption over 15 centuries of their history, poetry is still the most celebrated. Arab cultural identity revolves around language. The eloquence of the Qur'an was the proof of its divinity. The beauty of a line of poetry turned it into a proverb with all the moral authority of law or tradition. The role of poetry in creating collective identity among Arabs is well known. It is no coincidence that the prophet of the Arabs was called by some a poet, and that three centuries later Al-Mutanabbi, the greatest poet in medieval Arab history, called himself a prophet.</p> <p>Among the Palestinians this passion for poetry is heightened, because their collective identity is negated by their enemies and the rulers of the world. Poetry becomes a means of collective self-expression and hence of collective self-assertion. As such, it is safe to say that Mahmoud's poetry was never dissociated from Palestine and the Palestinian struggle for freedom. However, being an Arab Palestinian poet made him a spokesman for the Palestinian and Arab struggles for freedom, and that in itself was a heavier constraint on his freedom of writing and style.</p> <p>Mahmoud's later poetry was a continuous attempt to break free from the shackle-like crown bestowed on him by his people. Nonetheless, in his writing, these intentional attempts to make the struggle absent only made it all the more present, for one cannot intend to forget without remembering the very thing that one wants to forget.</p> <p>The paradoxical tension between freedom and its shackles was reflected in Mahmoud's relations with his friends, foes and political authority. He was close to the Palestinian leadership, whether in the phase of the PLO or the Palestinian Authority after Oslo. Nonetheless, he maintained a distance. Palestine had chosen his comrades for him, and he did not always like the choice. He once told me that, were it not for \"the struggle\", \"I would not have returned a good morning to many of those who now say they are my friends\". </p> <p>Like a kind of scientist, Mahmoud spent his life concocting Palestinian national identity, though its links to the land, and to the Arabic language and culture, were established long before him. In his poetry he tried to link that identity to a humanist global culture, to pre-Arab and pre-Islamic cultures of the Middle East, and to those details of human life that are beautiful in any culture or place. In doing so, he was not only asserting the humanity of the Palestinians, so often denied by Zionist discourse, but he was also humanising humanism to his people. To them and to Arabs, humanism was the discourse of a colonial invader who spoke about freedom and human rights, but gave them the state of Israel and military occupation and the prison at Abu Ghraib. In his poetry Mahmoud was trying to strengthen the ever-thinning thread between the Arabs and western culture, of which they have had very bad experiences. Already entrenched in his Arab culture and language, he started visiting other traditions in writing, style and content.</p> <p>It was certainly a sad moment on the hillside overlooking the city of Ramallah, just 16km from the prohibited Jerusalem, suffocated by the apartheid wall and military checkpoints. It was even a tragic moment for Mahmoud Darwish to die, leaving his people in this unprecedented vulnerability caused by the mistakes of their political leadership and the bloody and absurd fratricidal divisions that have emerged between the leading Palestinian factions over an illusory and ridiculous power. The nationwide grief for the loss of Mahmoud is partly a grass-roots protest against those worthless politicians on both sides of the divide. </p> <p>Darwish's complex legacy cannot be understood without reference to the political role he played, or was persuaded to play, however short or interrupted that was, but it would always be wise to place it in the context of the wider Palestinian question, which only becomes more complicated as time goes by, instead of reaching a just solution. On the hillside overlooking Ramallah, the Palestinian leadership intended to stage a funeral for a member of the PLO, while the people, who came out in their thousands with lines of his poems in their hands and on their shirts, and who were continuing a line of verse before he'd finished reading it, made it a poet's funeral. Mahmoud Darwish had once been a member of the PLO executive committee, but he resigned a very long time ago, and he finally emerged as one of the great Arab poets of modern times. The PLO wanted to celebrate his past. People celebrated his future. They were sure, and I am sure, that a real poet is one who never takes his future with him when he is laid to rest.</p> <h2> from The Dice Player</h2> <p>. . .

  "<p><strong>Jill Tunstall, 46</strong><br>Cards on the table? I've always felt that today's parents are a pampered breed. Legislation for this, time off for that, allocated parking spaces in Tesco ... I mean, how hard can it be? </p> <p>I arrive, after leaving two pages of detailed notes about my cat, my house and my library books, to find Alice halfway out of the door. \"Hero needs to be at her music lesson in an hour and she'd like her hair cut,\" are the only two instructions I get before she leaves with almost indecent haste.</p> <p>Suddenly, I am in charge of two kids, a huge B&amp;B, 15 guests (not the eight I was promised), an alsatian, two cats, three chickens and a hamster.</p> <p>It couldn't be further from my own life. At 46, and by choice, I live and work alone in a modest house on the North Wales coast, my only responsibilities a mortgage and an elderly cat. Instead of assuming more responsibilities with age, I am living the life of a carefree thirtysomething.</p> <p>Yet here I am in charge of what could, potentially, become the domestic version of the Titanic during my captaincy.</p> <p>But there is no time to contemplate my incarceration as I realise that we need to get cracking to make the music lesson. \"Get your shoes on,\" I instruct the children. Ten minutes later, I discover that neither has taken a bit of notice. </p> <p>We finally get there - 10 minutes late - and I realise Tybalt is wearing his mother's walking boots and two pairs of trousers. While his sister Hero, nine, performs her scales, I take Tybalt, my godson, to the outdoor shop. He wants everything, especially penknives. We leave with a pair of slippers, three sizes too big, that he insists he will grow into. </p> <p>An hour in and I'm already the victim of pester power. I've earned a coffee, I reckon, and head for a cafe where I tell the children to grab the sofas. Tybalt orders a chocolate cone with double choc-chip chocolate ice cream, a chocolate flake and a fudge stick. As I hand it to him, Hero tells me Tybalt sometimes has to go to his bedroom when he has too much chocolate. </p> <p>Later - at the end of the swap and by then far too late - I also discover that shandy with their pub supper, lemonade with breakfast and coffee at any time are also not allowed. </p> <p>I get them home and realise the chicken won't be cooked until 8pm - their bedtime. I bang it in the oven as the children start chasing each other round and round the kitchen in a sugar-fuelled frenzy. Just as I begin to get really, really tired of it all, they stop squabbling and agree to peel and chop the carrots. I feel like Supernanny. </p> <p>I wake at 7am to the full horror of having to meet and greet 15 people, plus get the children ready for the day. How? </p> <p>If I started every day like this I'd have a nervous breakdown within a week. In my life it begins about 9am with coffee and newspapers. </p> <p>Then Hero arrives in the middle of breakfast in her pyjamas demanding that I straighten her hair, the toilet blocks and, as I pull on rubber gloves, the cat brings a dead mouse into the breakfast room.</p> <p>\"Are you really 52?\" asks Tybalt. No, I'm really not but I feel much, much older right at this minute, I tell him. And, I wonder, how does Alice manage this on a day-to-day basis, let alone with PMT, flu or a broken heart? I try to book the children into a skiing session so that I can tackle the B&amp;B ironing but the children scream so much I cannot hear a thing. I scream back: \"Shut up!\"</p> <p>Their eyes pop out on stalks but my position of supremacy crumbles when two B&amp;B guests walk in and I have to apologise.</p> <p>I fall into bed each night without a shower or a proper meal, and not realising that the children haven't washed, cleaned their teeth or done their homework. I'm craving solitude or a full-on night out with adults who speak my language. And my maternal instinct is as dormant as ever.</p> <p>Days later Alice returns with blow-dried hair, San Tropez tan, red dress and heels. I want to cry. I am in a tea-stained T-shirt and have just spent an hour mopping floors. \"That's how I feel when you turn up looking glamorous,\" she confides, which makes me feel quite guilty.</p> <p>But at least I'm finally free again. I say goodbye to the kids, who seem rather relieved to have their mother back, and drive away, stopping at a cafe to relish the freedom of not having to think for anybody else.</p> <p>I feel a small stab of pride at having survived Alice's life. Strangely though, the chairs opposite me do seem sadly empty and I find myself wondering if I will have anyone to mourn me when I'm gone, especially as the Tunstall line ends with me.</p> <p>Why is that important, I muse? When I'm gone, I'm gone. And then it occurs to me that all this lineage stuff is just an emotional burden heaped on women over the years to keep them busy bearing children.</p> <p>My child-free state was never a decision I took. I just never wanted them. I used to wonder whether I'd wake up one day with the over- whelming urge to create new life that other women, including my sisters, talk about - but it never happened. </p> <p>Recently it cost me a long-term relationship with my partner.</p> <p>So there was no epiphany after being at Alice's, just a realisation of what it takes if your hormones do tell you that you cannot live without children. </p> <p>Oh, and a grudging concession that, OK, maybe those supermarket parking spaces are deserved, after all. I may have a bit further to walk in the rain but, having seen the alternative, I'll take that any day of the week ...</p> <p><strong>Alice Douglas, 43</strong><br>Jill is my childless best friend. All overworked, over-achieving mothers have a childless best friend. They serve, for the mother, a dual role. On the one hand they allow us to pretend that we would be as well-dressed, well-organised, healthy, thin, successful and independent, not to mention politically informed, as they are, were it not for the fact that we are mothers. </p> <p>On the other, when we are feeling in need of some reassurance that our lives are not simply a round of spare tyres, sleeplessness and dirty hair, we can flip things over and affirm ourselves by feeling sorry for them because they haven't got children. (This works despite the fact that I know that Jill never wanted kids in the first place.)</p> <p>Even Jill's front door is calm. Not like mine, scuffed in mud from being kicked in impatience by my children as I fumble to open it. This front door is battle-scar free, spotless. I open it slowly, fearful of spoiling its pristine facade, but not slowly enough to stop Flinty, the decrepit cat, from making her getaway. </p> <p>The next thing to greet me is a tidy hallway. As if to offer a taste of the shocking comparisons to come, the image of my own front porch flashes before me. I have always dreamed of a tidy porch like this. But then I'd have to sort the hundreds of pairs of out-grown, scuffed shoes and bits of mud-splattered kit - and who knows what horrors lurk beneath.</p> <p>I tried to pacify myself. Smugness usually works, I thought. My porch-way is, after all, the stuff of life, of living - a full life. A life of children. Poor Jill, I think, smiling Madonna-like to myself.</p> <p>Despite the fact that Jill has been a patient observer for years, I have played down the chaos that is my life. The last thing I want is for her to pull the rug on my first opportunity for peace and order in nine years.</p> <p>For my part, I am looking at a glorious spell off the treadmill. Bliss. I won't even go into the deal that Jill is staring in the face.</p> <p>I slump on the sofa and stare at the order around me. I breathe a relaxed sigh. Then it begins. Solitude. Terror of my youth. I hoick up Flinty, the cat, against her will, on to the sofa beside me and begin to stroke her frantically. </p> <p>It is a little like a phobia, this long-lost enemy. Before, I was always afraid when my life wasn't filled to the brim, but I had so many fears in those days that life was one long round of running away from them. I thought that children had cured that, but now sitting alone in the delicious tranquillity of Jill's house I begin to ask myself whether, in fact, I hadn't been running all the time. How would I now cope with being forced to stop and smell the roses? Flinty, I think, Flinty will be my friend.</p> <p>I also turn to my most reliable form of diversion from complicated thoughts and started to feel peckish. As mothers know, when all else fails, eat. I decide to check out the kitchen. </p> <p>The first thing I find (and the guilt, bearing in mind that I have left nothing for Jill, is acute) are two pages of meticulous instructions. How to water the plants, how to feed the cat, how to take a library book back. That will certainly be a new experience. I shall very much enjoy the gentle five-minute walk to the library, unencumbered by children and shopping. Yes, this library book will certainly go back.</p> <p>The next thing I find - to my utter dismay - is that apart from a jar of gherkins, half a packet of oatcakes and a tin of olives, the cupboard is, as they say, absolutely bare. Jill told me later that she thought that I would enjoy the pleasure of shopping alone, for just me. The thought doesn't even occur to me. It's not that I don't know how to shop - after all, shopping in our house is usually a two-trolley, \u00a3400 affair. It's just that left with the thought of \"just me\" I am utterly lost. Thank goodness for the booze! </p> <p>As I climb up the stairs with a glass of white wine and my little plate of titbits I start to worry. How will Jill cope? What if she forgets to lock the doors or the place catches fire? What if she doesn't shut up the chickens for the night or check that we have enough sausages for breakfast? How will she manage 15 B&amp;B guests? </p> <p>Then I miss my children and the guilt starts. </p> <p>But then I remember Jill, who she is. She will cope, of course, and we will laugh about it. And life opens up. It's amazing how the hours pass with a glass of wine, a bit of peace and a telephone. And then there is Jill's fantastic library. I'll be able to read more than 10 lines without falling asleep. Perhaps solitude isn't so bad.</p> <p>In the morning, the number nine etches itself out before my eyes on the digital clock - 9am, a full 14 hours sleep. Oh, joy! </p> <p>Putting on Jill's Mindfulness CD, I gently saunter to my breakfast and to Desert Island Discs on Radio 4. This can't be true. The whole programme uninterrupted. </p> <p>The days follow serenely. I hum to myself as I water plants. I even tell my son Tybalt to stop ringing all the time. Over-anxious Mum seems to have gone on holiday too. Perhaps I realise that I might just as well worry about the sky falling down or the planet spinning off its axis as worry about the kids incessantly. </p> <p>Experiencing Jill's environment showed me that she lives her life, while my life lives me. She chose her child-free state for well thought out reasons, while I jumped into my fantasy of a big family and a welter of people coming and going without a shadow of deliberation. </p> <p>This life swap experience forced me to deal with the present in a way I never do. I usually have no time to savour the moment because I am too busy preparing for the one to come. I have promised myself that I'm going to take better care of myself. More aromatherapy baths, less toxic food. More sauvignon blanc. And more books. Jill has such lovely books.</p>",
  "<p>The world swirls all around him, but Martin Lawrence seems strangely trapped in space and time. We hardly notice any more but, yes, he still makes movies. Indeed, College Road Trip is his second comedy this year after Welcome Home, Roscoe Jenkins, both of which I very kindly watched so that you wouldn't have to (and, yeah, I think I do deserve a medal). </p> <p>But whatever I think, his movies somehow make depressingly high sums anyway, given the disputable quality of what he's selling us. But how did it come to this? Lawrence has at various points in his career fallen into the orbit of nearly every major figure in the highest circles of African-American Hollywood, either receiving from them the baton of comedy genius (only to fumble it with another crappy sex comedy or naff interracial action movie) or handing it on to younger performers eager to make something of the opportunity. Lawrence certainly has a raw, natural talent - I can attest to his having made me laugh on, ooh, several occasions - but what has he ever done with it? </p> <p>Lawrence was in at the dawn of the New Black Cinema of the late-80s, when Spike Lee and others finally - finally! - won a measure of access for African-American artists in Hollywood. He had roles in Lee's Do The Right Thing and in the box-office smash House Party. In Boomerang he was second male lead to Eddie Murphy, his idol, a sure sign that he was on the way to the top.</p> <p>Thus he found himself in Bad Boys alongside Will Smith, whose TV-launched career ran parallel to Martin's for a while. </p> <p>The Fresh Prince turned himself first into a superstar, then into a global brand, and thence into the box-office phenomenon known as Mr July The Fourth. Martin Lawrence, meanwhile, went nuts, being at various times found waving loaded guns around in public places while raving incoherently, marrying Miss Virginia for a nanosecond, making sexist jokes that got him banned from Saturday Night Live for life, or being accused of sexually harassing co-star Tisha Campbell on his sitcom Martin. He later claimed he'd been smoking too much pot - which any pothead will tell you is, like, totally bogus, bro! </p> <p>Since his recovery, Lawrence has hacked his way through Blue Streak, Black Knight, Rebound, the Big Momma movies and other dross, while being utterly outpaced. He's now cannibalising the work of his more industrious imitators: the Dave Chappelles, Chris Rocks and Bernie Macs (RIP) who went on to better, funnier projects of their own. College Road Trip, however, is little more than his retread of Are We There Yet? (in which Ice Cube did an eighth-rate Steve Martin retread), while Roscoe Jenkins is a witless stab at the hit formula patented by black cinema's latest poster boy, Tyler Perry. </p> <p>In fact, all his most successful movies are like embarrassing entries from other people's mid-career slumps. </p> <p>Me, I've stopped waiting for The Real Martin Lawrence to stand up. Now I'd just like him to shut up.</p>",
  "<p>Almost everyone hates meetings, and yet the idea of doing away with them is seen as revolutionary, or ridiculous. Jim Buckmaster, chief executive of the hugely successful website Craigslist, has a simple policy - \"No meetings, ever\" - but if you're a manager, you're probably already thinking of reasons why you couldn't do the same. An important new book, Why Work Sucks And How To Fix It, proposes a total shift in how we think about office life, but one part is considered so startling, it's singled out on the cover: \"No meetings.\" Senior executives find at least half of all meetings unproductive, studies show. Yet still they happen. \"Meetings,\" writes the humorist Dave Barry, \"are an addictive, highly self-indulgent activity that corporations and other large organisations habitually engage in only because they cannot actually masturbate.\"</p> <p>Why Work Sucks And How To Fix It reports on an experiment I mentioned here during its earlier stages, at the US electronics chain BestBuy: a \"results-only work environment\", in which staff could work where and when they liked, so long as their jobs got done. The first casualty was meetings. \"Why do we spend so much of our business life talking about the business we need to take care of?\" the authors write. </p> <p>There are several reasons why meetings don't work. They move, in the words of the career coach Dale Dauten, \"at the pace of the slowest mind in the room\", so that \"all but one participant will be bored, all but one mind underused\". A key purpose of meetings is information transfer, but they're based on the assumption that people absorb information best by hearing it, rather than reading it or discussing it over email, whereas in fact, only a minority of us are \"auditory learners\". PowerPoint presentations may be worse. The investigation into the 2003 Columbia space shuttle disaster, caused by a fuel tank problem, suggested that Nasa engineers might have been hampered in addressing it sooner because it was presented on PowerPoint slides, forcing the information into hierarchical lists of bullet points, ill-suited to how most brains work.</p> <p>The key question for distinguishing a worthwhile meeting from a worthless one seems to be this: is it a \"status-report\" meeting, designed for employees to tell each other things? If so, it's probably better handled on email or paper. That leaves a minority of \"good\" meetings, whose value lies in the meeting of minds itself, for example, a well-run brainstorming session.</p> <p>Countless books advise managers on how to motivate staff. But motivation isn't the problem. Generally, people want to work; they gripe when things like meetings stop them doing so. Indeed, a 2006 study showed there's only one group of people who say meetings enhance their wellbeing - those who also score low on \"accomplishment striving\". In other words: people who enjoy meetings are those who don't like getting things done.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com\">oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The number of homeowners in England and Wales facing repossession has risen to levels unseen since the last recession in the early 1990s. </p> <p>Ministry of justice figures released yesterday showed the number of court orders for mortgage repossessions in England and Wales rose to 28,568 in the three months to the end of June. That is 24% more than in the same period a year ago and the highest since the third quarter of 1992, when 30,587 orders were made.</p> <p>Adam Sampson, chief executive of the housing and homelessness charity Shelter, accused mortgage lenders of \"still using repossession as the first, rather than last resort, despite being urged not to\".</p> <p>He said the figures could be the \"thin end of the wedge\" as Shelter data showed the proportion of people approaching the charity for help with mortgage possession actions over the past six months had increased by 55%.</p> <p>\"Every day Shelter is seeing more and more people who are terrified of losing their homes. They're being punished by rising household bills, escalating fuel charges and food prices that are going through the roof,\" said Sampson. He said people finding it hard to meet mortgage payments should seek advice early. </p> <p>Opposition parties attacked the government. Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Vincent Cable, said: \"The level of growth of repossession orders suggests we are on track for a repossession crisis very similar to the early 1990s.</p> <p>\"It is absolutely vital the government should intervene and require a proper code of conduct to be implemented by mortgage lenders. This should not just apply to the big banks but to the large number of secondary lenders who are using court action to pursue their debts in a very aggressive way.</p> <p>Shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Philip Hammond, said: \"This is the human cost of Gordon Brown's economic incompetence. He betrayed families by claiming he'd abolished boom and bust and encouraging a 'spend now, pay later' culture. Now times are getting tougher, thousands are losing their homes because they can no longer make ends meet.</p> <p>\"Lenders must now act responsibly - even if our prime minister has not done so - to minimise the number of people losing their homes.\"</p> <p>Housing minister Caroline Flint said the government was doing more to help hard-pressed homeowners, including expanding free legal representation in county courts for those at risk of repossession and providing more free debt advice.</p> <p>\"Whilst we are not seeing repossessions on the same scale as the early 1990s, we are making sure the right advice and support is available for the minority of borrowers who may need it at the moment because of global economic pressures.\" </p> <p>The ministry of justice said the number of people facing bankruptcy in England and Wales rose 7% in the second quarter to 19,158, from 17,847 in the first three months of the year and a near 5% increase on a year ago. The number of creditor petitions, served by people who are owed money, jumped 17% to 5,625 from the first quarter, while the number of people who opted for bankruptcy - debtor petitions - climbed nearly 4% to 13,533.</p>",
  "<p>The fall-out from Liverpool's arduous pursuit of Gareth Barry continued yesterday when Xabi Alonso asked to leave Anfield and Rafael Ben\u00edtez revealed evidence of his strained relationship with the club's chief executive, Rick Parry.</p> <p>Alonso, a recent transfer target for Juventus and Arsenal, wants to be sold having become disillusioned with the manager's attempts to finance the Barry deal by off-loading the Spain international amid concerns that his first team chances will be reduced this season. The 26-year-old has not submitted a transfer request, but has asked the club to renew its efforts to sell him in the coming weeks - a stance that will alert the Arsenal manager, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger.</p> <p>Arsenal are the only club to have made an official inquiry about Alonso since his proposed transfer to Juventus collapsed over Liverpool's \u00a318m valuation. They too, however, share the Italians' view that Liverpool's price-tag is excessive and are only prepared to pay around \u00a312m for the playmaker who moved to Anfield from Real Sociedad for \u00a310.5m in 2004. Without a compromise from either party Alonso will be left in limbo this season but Ben\u00edtez remains intent on signing Barry, who is also valued at \u00a318m by Aston Villa, and is prepared to sell his compatriot and/or Jermaine Pennant and Andriy Voronin to fund the transfer of his own accord.</p> <p>Ben\u00edtez was refused a short-term loan to complete the Barry transfer last week by the Liverpool owners, Tom Hicks and George Gillett, with Parry, while denying the Americans had not backed their manager's judgement, issuing a statement that confirmed Villa's asking price was \"too high\". The Liverpool manager has since had e-mail conversations with the Americans and has been told money is available for other transfers. But yesterday he dismissed suggestions he had driven up Barry's price by publicly revealing Liverpool's interest before the end of last season and that the failure to sell Alonso had changed the club's transfer policy. In doing so, he indicated the Liverpool chief executive was accountable for the Barry saga now entering its fourth month.</p> <p>\"I get blamed for everything, for global warming to high petrol prices,\" said Ben\u00edtez. \"But in this case [Barry] I want to be very clear. Since I talked to Martin O'Neill about the situation in April, I have not talked to anyone at Aston Villa. All the talks have been between our chief executive Rick Parry, the owner and the chief executive of Aston Villa. And those talks have all been pretty good.</p> <p>\"If anyone wants to talk about Barry in the future they must talk with the owner, Rick Parry or the chief executive of Aston Villa. I was not involved in the talks about Barry, I was not involved in the talks about Alonso and Arsenal. If you want to talk about these players you must talk to the chief executive of our club who was handling the discussions. If you want to talk about football, then you talk with me.\"</p> <p>The Liverpool manager remains confident of a resolution before the close of the transfer window, however. \"We continue working and we have time. I have some players in mind,\" he added.</p>",
  "<p>China defeated Hong Kong last night to advance into the final of the Olympic women's team table tennis, which on the spectrum of the unexpected is like saying Doris Lessing defeated Katie Price last night to advance to the final shortlist of the Orange Prize for literature.</p> <p>The comparison may seem like a slight on the three members of the Hong Kong team, Lau Sui Fei, Lin Ling and Tie Yana, all of whom played as well as they could in front of a riotously partisan home crowd at the Peking University Gymnasium before succumbing by a 3-0 margin (in a best-of-five-matches contest). But the outcome of the women's table tennis team event at the 2008 Olympic Games is written in the stars, or at least in the rankings.</p> <p>The Chinese trio of Zhang Yining, Guo Yue and Wang Nan are listed as one, two and five in the world, with numbers three and four - also Chinese - deemed surplus to requirements for these Games.</p> <p>It is a similar story in the men's team event, where the host squad comprises three of the world's top four players, with the fourth warming up on the subs bench. Only in the individual events, where upsets do occasionally happen, as was the case when Seung Min Ryu of Korea won the men's singles in Athens four years ago, is there a slight chance of the hosts failing to win the gold medal this time round. </p> <p>Even if the athlete in the Chinese kit does not win then a Chinese athlete probably will. Seventeen of the 56 nations entered in the table tennis events are being represented by Chinese nationals.</p> <p>In their relentless way these numbers tell their own story of China's obsession with table tennis but there is a more human version and it was present last night in the 7,000-seater arena, where the full house raucously encouraged their players on to an easy win. It was present, too, in the post-match comments of the Singaporean player Li Jiawei, who had earlier helped her team defeat South Korea, landing them with the unhappy task of facing the home team in today's final. \"We fought today's contest as if it was the final,\" Li said. \"We won't beat China.\"</p> <p>Those who have forked out exorbitant sums (by local standards) on the black market for tickets for today's session might frown at such defeatist talk but, as they wait for the inevitable, they can seek comfort in something Confucius never said but should have; in life, in sport, in table tennis, it is sometimes the journey that counts not the destination.</p> <p>Fortunately, the journey that led table tennis to become China's national pastime is a fascinating one, with its origins in the 1949 revolution. The Communists were ostracised by most of the world, including by those who ran sport, but one of the first organisations to recognise the new regime, in 1953, was the International Table Tennis Federation. Grateful for this small, if bizarre, mercy, Mao Zedong gave his government's backing to a campaign to educate the masses in a sport that had been little played in China until then. Within six years, Rong Guotuan became the country's first world champion. The rest is history, and not just of the sporting variety. In 1971, friendly contact between US and Chinese players at the world championships in Japan encouraged Mao to invite a US team to China, which led to President Nixon's visit within the year.</p> <p>The China-US rapprochement was a serious achievement for table tennis, but then the Chinese have always taken it seriously, never more so than in the run-up to these Olympics. Home athletes have spoken over the last week about the added pressure of performing in front of the adoring home crowds but none must feel the pressure like the table tennis players.</p> <p>\"If I could have my life again I would not have chosen to be an athlete,\" Zhang Yining, China's leading female player, was reported as saying in the run-up to the Games. </p> <p>This was a miserable admission from the mouth of the world's best player and, as she skipped through her match last night, the suspicion was that she must surely have been misquoted.</p> <p>Yet afterwards in the press conference, Zhang cut an exhausted, miserable figure. \"We can turn the pressure (of playing in Beijing) to our advantage and make it a driving force,\" she said, and in these robotic words came the sense that if the immediate future was gold for Chinese table tennis then all is not golden in the life of a Chinese table tennis player.</p>",
  "<p>In the anarchic world we politely term international relations, there was little surprising or unusual about the Russian aggressions into South Ossetia and Abkhazia. A great power was in a fierce quarrel with a small neighbour about that most commonplace cause of war - who should be boss when mixed ethnic groups claim the same lands and straddle international borders. Eventually the larger nation savagely spanked the smaller one, chiefly to impose its own solution on the problem but partly also to remind onlookers of that age-old truth: \"the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must\". Big boys still rule. </p> <p>Yet if there are no surprises, there certainly are many intriguing implications. As diplomatic historians well know, a relatively small incident in foreign affairs can have an importance well beyond the region in which the clash takes place - because of the responses of the larger powers, because it reveals the strengths and weaknesses of the available international machinery, and because it reminds us of the political realities and priorities of the age. Yet crises that seemed serious at the time - say, the Anglo-French confrontation over Fashoda in 1898 - have faded into the dustiest textbooks. A somewhat later crisis, such as Munich in 1938, is continually thrown up as a \"lesson\" for our present age.</p> <p>More often than not, a sudden confrontation can catch a great power in a state of some confusion. It would be fascinating, for instance, to know how the Chinese politburo is regarding the events in Ossetia. At present, clearly, its chief concern is the Olympics, and there must surely be irritation with both Georgia and Russia for pushing their quarrel into open shooting now. There must also be concern about revived Russian assertiveness and nationalism - although there is no fear in Beijing, for the Chinese know the canny Putin wouldn't push things against them: China is strong, and doesn't mind taking losses, so don't mess with it. More upsetting, Russia has breached that clause of the UN charter China holds most important of all: no interference in the internal affairs of a member nation.</p> <p>On the other hand, the Han Chinese cannot but like the idea of dissident ethnic minorities along a troublesome border being firmly spanked. Georgia's fate is not a matter of direct concern to Beijing. And Putin's roughing of Mikheil Saakashvili's government is a blow to American prestige and influence in Asia, always a congenial thought to China. So, while never, ever trusting the Russians, China can see that the Ossetian mess is nothing to get upset about.</p> <p>This is certainly not the feeling in Nato and the EU, or in the major capitals of Europe. Here, above all in France and Germany (Gordon Brown seems beset by his own regional difficulties, in Scotland), there is concern that Russian military actions and political toughness portend a fading away of the post-1991 \"new European order\" - that it is a sort of latter-day Rhineland crisis of 1936, heralding the end of Versailles treaty Europe. Friendship with Russia cannot wear the bullying and blackmail of western companies like BP, the attempted intimidation of Russian dissidents in the west, the re-entry of the KGB into foreign countries - in sum, the plain fact that Russia is not \"normal\". It is not Poland, it is not Hungary; it never knew the Enlightenment. </p> <p>And it is scary in other ways. First, Russia is terrifying to all those east European states that sought eagerly to flee the bear's grasp at the first opportunity following 1989 and 1991: to states, therefore, to whom Europe extended not only the economic and cultural ties of the EU but the security ties of Nato, with all its frightening implications. Right now, Georgia is not a Nato member, despite the Bush administration's urgings. This must be a cause for massive, nervous relief in Brussels and Washington. But what if a border dispute arises between Estonia (now in Nato) and Russia? Are the Portuguese and Danish armies prepared to march east? Are the Germans? Secondly, how will western and central Europe handle its heavy dependence on Russian natural gas, and its awful capacity for being blackmailed by Moscow? Things have come a long way since the wall crashed down in November 1989.</p> <p>As for the US, the possible implications of the last week are many and serious. Consider the challenge facing Washington: how on earth to make a coherent policy in response to a distant, fast-exploding ethno-linguistic conflict, contested borders, a risk-prone Georgian ally, an increasingly assertive Russia with a new energy trump card, a confused EU and a paralysed security council? All at a time when other areas of the world have sucked in US military resources, as if its own politicians were not already preoccupied enough by the nonsenses of presidential campaigning. We don't have the big stick. Moscow does, at least in this area of the world. You can only push western influence so far eastwards into Eurasia. Napoleon learned that, Hitler learned that: George Bush's time has come.</p> <p>This brings us to the larger geopolitical meaning of the Georgian scrap - namely, the measure of US power in today's fast-changing world. It could be better. It has been brought lower during the past eight years by inconsiderate and sometimes arrogant diplomacy, by an obsession with \"the war on terror\" and reckless fiscal policies. The post-1991 decade of the US's position as unchallenged number one - in Charles Krauthammer's memorable phrase, \"the unipolar moment\" - is over. To later historians, the pace of this shift will seem astounding. In the early 1990s, the elder George Bush, James Baker and other foreign policy veterans were wondering how to prevent Russia collapsing. Now the concern is about excessive Russian power.</p> <p>To other scholars, the Caucasian struggles may appear as a storm in a teacup. The real challenge to the US in the future - and perhaps to the west more generally - is the steady rise of Asia and, in particular, China. Putin's muscle-flexing against pesky small neighbours is a mischievous distraction. </p> <p>At the end of the day (but when is that?), it is probably Putin's hard-knuckled Russia that will be the loser. He may look tough and confident now, but his deck of cards is not so strong for the future. His strength rests on two supports: energy supplies and Russian nationalism. Those oil and natural-gas resources may evaporate sooner than he thinks. And Russian nationalism provokes enormous fear, enmity and resistance. Around the vast, open frontiers of the present Russian republic, and among the 100 ethnic minorities within the borders, no one loves the Russians. That has to be a geopolitical drag.</p> <p>So the Ossetian scrap is important, though it should not be exaggerated out of proportion. But it tells us a lot about our present, delicate, international system of states. We have interesting times ahead.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Paul Kennedy is Dilworth professor of history and director of international security studies at Yale University.

  "<p>Awful August, the weather forecasters call this unseasonably cold, wet month, as holiday-makers huddle against intermittent monsoon downpours, reminded that global warming doesn't necessarily mean a Mediterranean Britain. </p> <p>Every month, reports from climatologists deliver worse predictions of the speed and tipping points for irreversible climate change. A 4C temperature rise is the latest warning: it would bring unimaginable horror in its wake. The time to act gets shorter, but the political will to act lags ever further behind the science that tells politicians they must do so. Latest figures, including air travel, shipping and energy used in our goods manufactured abroad, show no cut in Britain but an 18% growth in emissions.</p> <p>If the market is the answer, soaring energy prices should drive down emissions. Road traffic figures showed a 2% drop in car use, with demand for petrol briefly 20% down - but already it is rising again as the price falls. On household energy - responsible for 27% of emissions - it's too early to know the effect of 30% price increases. But as one hour of an old-fashioned lightbulb still only costs 0.8p, energy prices may not be noticed by those who already consume most. Those who will make serious cuts are the poorest and debt-averse pensioners. Official fuel poverty figures are expected to rise to 5 million people this winter: more deaths are expected among the old and cold. Back in Labour's optimistic can-do days in 2000, the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act created a legal obligation to eliminate fuel poverty among the vulnerable by 2010, a target missed by so many light years that Friends of the Earth is seeking a judicial review to get the act enforced. Gordon Brown's plan to buy off the problem with \u00a3100 vouchers for the poor is no answer.</p> <p>What does the public think the answer should be? The Institute for Public Policy Research has just conducted the most extensive consultation so far, with focus groups in Newcastle, Camden, Southwark, Bristol and rural Suffolk across all social groups, as well as a nationwide opinion poll and interviews with energy companies, climate change NGOs and consumer organisations. The results pointed in one clear direction.</p> <p>Seventy-four per cent said they are \"very concerned\" or \"fairly concerned\" about climate change - so politicians can ignore the shrinking, unconcerned minority. Seventy-one per cent thought action was necessary to curb people's energy use. But there was pessimism about the public changing its behaviour: only one in 10 thought people would drive less or take fewer flights. Naturally, favourite choices were the painless ones - the cheaper, environmentally friendly options. Least popular was any system that taxed energy use.</p> <p>They were offered three possible government actions. First, a carbon tax could be added to all energy not generated from renewables. Second, a cap on the amount of carbon that companies could emit in selling their energy to consumers would force them to generate more from renewables: they would pass on the extra cost to consumers. But both of these were regarded as too unfair, with the impact felt least by the wealthy who burn most energy.</p> <p>Personal carbon trading was the most popular option: it was the fairest and it wasn't seen as a new tax. Here's how it works: each year everyone gets equal carbon credits to spend on petrol, home heating or air travel. People exceeding their quota can buy more credits. People who use less can sell credits. It encourages home insulation, energy saving and less driving or flying. Since low earners use less - 20% have no car, 50% don't fly - they can profit by selling to those with big houses, foreign holidays and gas-guzzling cars. It would be a powerful but voluntary agent for redistribution.</p> <p>Failure to pursue personal carbon trading (or any other method) joined the long list of good causes killed by Labour cowardice. At Defra, David Miliband took it up with enthusiasm and commissioned a feasibility study, but after he made a strong speech advocating it, Gordon Brown at the Treasury banned any further mention. Miliband was moved away and what was called a \"pre-feasibility study\", limped out with the judgment that this idea was \"ahead of its time\". They guessed it would cost \u00a32bn a year to run, threw up sundry obstacles, and the report disappeared.</p> <p>Odd that a government with computers thinks it can't introduce a simple credit system, when a Nectar or Oyster card shows how easily home and car fuel bills and airline tickets could be deducted. Historian Mark Roodhouse of York University draws comparisons with his work on wartime rationing. Back then the state provided ration books for all, covering not just fuel but coupons valuing virtually every individual item in the shops from clothes to food. </p> <p>Have we become more administratively incompetent since then? Roodhouse records the wartime internal debates about whether to cut national consumption by raising prices. \"They concluded rationing was the only way to achieve dramatic cuts without feeding inflation or causing social unrest,\" he reports. They, too, considered making ration coupons tradable but decided equality of sacrifice was essential. But Roodhouse considers tradable carbon rations \"would improve on the system, preventing black markets in unused coupons\". The trading element makes carbon rationing feel more voluntary and less oppressive. </p> <p>In distribution of wealth, Britain is now back to 1937 levels of inequality, regressing backwards every year: that's what makes any kind of carbon tax or reliance on high prices impossible, the burden falling too unfairly. Doling out ad hoc energy vouchers to the poor at the taxpayers' expense is the wrong answer, and it only adds to the poverty trap by making the step up harder to climb. Will Brown at least pay for it with a windfall tax on profiteering energy companies? But if personal carbon trading is \"ahead of its time\", that is exactly where we need to be. Cowardly political leaders dare not tell voters the plain truth that we need to cut energy use. If Miliband makes his run for the leadership, plain speaking about the climate will be one of his pitches - and bravery on personal carbon trading will be a test of candidates' seriousness about both climate and social justice.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>But, soft! What light through yonder window breaks? Yes, folks, it's new season time, and we're going to be wearing doublets. I'll talk you through the breeches next week.

(Yes, crecrunched. That credit crunch phrase is so last season, don't you think? Needs a new season makeover, as we say in this neck of the woods.) The last couple of winters have done the groundwork, warming us up to the sleeveless concept (waistcoats, tank tops).

Not just in an anointed-by-Marc-Jacobs kind of a way (although they are) but in a surprisingly practical way.

In the lobby, a self-consciously hip young couple are having a domestic. At the front desk, a man with silvery hair stands with a pigeon on his shoulder. They are all regular guests.</p> <p>The Chelsea, a landmark on Manhattan's West 23rd Street, has for decades been a mecca for bohemians - poets, painters and punks who lived and died in its rooms. Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin all once called it home. Edie Sedgwick set fire to it. Sid Vicious was charged with stabbing his girlfriend to death in room 100. In short, it's not what most people would call a great environment for families. </p> <p>But try telling that to Joseph O'Neill, Sally Singer and their three children. O'Neill, an Irish writer whose new novel Netherland is hotly tipped to win this year's Man Booker prize, and Singer, a fashion journalist at Vogue, have set up an elegant, kitschy home in the hotel that describes itself as \"a rest stop for rare individuals\".</p> <p>Saturday morning breakfast at the O'Neills' is a chaotic affair. When I visit, we sit over takeaway coffee and croissants in the tiny retro-chic kitchen as a flurry of small, screaming boys dash around us. The cat, Lola, a tawny, green-eyed queen with a powder-puff tail, swishes in and out of the room. O'Neill, dressed in cricket gear for his weekly game, is gracious and chatty. </p> <p>\"They like the Chelsea,\" he says, referring to the children, because despite the sensationalised stories, \"There's a strong sense of community and it's one of the last fragments of a counter-cultural, unselfconscious place.\"</p> <p>Singer enjoys the perverse glamour of living in a hotel. \"I like that there are transients coming in every night,\" she says. \"I love the continual stream of people to look at. I don't want to live in my own closed-off space. People just drop by and knock on your door. I want to open my door and let the world in - and let my kids out.\"</p> <p>Their cosy, light-filled, three- bedroom suite, sparsely decorated with a mix of modern and antique pieces, seamlessly blends glamour and domesticity. In the living room, the white walls are filled with family photographs, while moody silkscreen images of Sid Vicious take pride of place above a curvy white sofa. </p> <p>The children have their own brightly wallpapered two-room suite - one room for sleeping and the other for playing. Tucked away beyond the playroom, stretching along the entire length of the wall, cubby-hole shelves sparkle with a vast clutter of women's shoes. (O'Neill reveals that \"Sally confessed only after we were together for a while that she was a fashion addict.\") </p> <p>The couple arrived in Manhattan in 1998, having emigrated from London with their two cats. \"Sally was offered a job at Elle,\" says O'Neill, \"so we crossed the ocean out of curiosity.\" He had no credit history and Singer, who is American, had virtually lost hers as a consequence of living abroad. So they ended up at the Chelsea with its bordello-like atmosphere, rock'n'roll ghosts and luminaries past and present. Since they have lived there, Deborah Harry, Ethan Hawke and the singer-songwriters Ryan Adams and Rufus Wainwright have taken up residence at various times.</p> <p>Previously little known, O'Neill, 44, is this year's sensation for his novel Netherland. Hailed as the \"King of New York\" by New York Magazine, he's been compared to an array of literary greats from F Scott Fitzgerald to VS Naipaul. The New York Times Book Review praised Netherland as \"the wittiest, angriest, most exacting and desolate work of fiction written about life in post 9/11 New York\". Much of his racy thriller is set in the Chelsea itself. The narrator, Dutch exile Hans van der Broek, adrift after his wife leaves him, observes that at the Chelsea, \"the furtiveness and ornamental diversity reminds him of the population of an aquarium he kept as a child\". </p> <p>For the O'Neill boys, too, the hotel is vivid and otherworldly, like the inside of a genie bottle, teeming with magical possibilities and exotic creatures. They race their bikes and skateboards along the white marble corridors past drag queens, mad old ladies, ageing rockers and men with angel wings and tiaras. For them, as their father says, every day is Halloween. Their mother thinks it's a good, stimulating environment for children.</p> <p>\"Come talk about why you live here,\" Singer asks her eight-year-old son, Malachy, as he shows his new comic book, one of a series that he wrote, coloured and stapled, scattered around the flat. </p> <p>\"Because I was born here,\" he snaps.</p> <p>\"What do you like about the hotel?\" she persists. </p> <p>\"I like the guy who lived in the bathroom.\"</p> <p>This gentleman, she explains, was \"squatting in the communal bathroom. They had to kick him out one morning and he went crazy.\" </p> <p>Does Malachy think any of the people are strange? \"Mrs Bolow. The woman who lies in bed all day,\" he says after a while. \"And the ghost who threw your platform shoe at me while I was sleeping.\" As for his younger brothers, they like living at the hotel \"because you get to climb stuff\". </p> <p>What do their family and friends think about bringing up children in a hotel? \"Most of our friends don't think it is strange,\" says O'Neill. \"I'm not sure how my parents feel. I imagine the Chelsea is not what they had in mind, but that it's no big deal. It's not as if we're living in a yurt.\" </p> <p>\"I know there are many people who wouldn't dream of bringing up their children in a hotel, where a large proportion of the people are checking in for the night,\" adds Singer. \"I know some people like to control the environment that children live in. They find comfort in predictability because the city is unexpected enough. But if you want to live in a sheltered world, where there's a doorman and no rogue element, you don't check into a hotel. What makes you persist, even when it doesn't make economic sense, is that people who live here deeply connect with it and don't think about things in a traditional way.\" </p> <p>Singer considers the hotel to be an eclectic, multi-generational village. \"There are grandparents whose grandchildren come and visit them and the teenagers next door, who we've known since they were kids, are our babysitters. There are other families in the building so the boys have friends here. They go to the local primary school and take part in the usual round of sleepovers, parties and adventures in the hallways. We also have eccentrics of every description and everyone tolerates it. There's that old-fashioned communal attitude here.\" </p> <p>O'Neill claims he's not one for nostalgia but \"the whole place is magic. But it's not a theme park. It's authentic, an organic village in the middle of the city, where the people are friendly and fascinating.\" It's also a place where you quickly learn to integrate the extraordinary into the everyday - the stream of fashion and film shoots and cocktail parties in the lobby. One of O'Neill's fondest memories is when he and Malachy, then a baby, were invited over for dinner by the late playwright Arnold Weinstein, who lived across the hall, and they ended up spending the evening with Arthur Miller, his photographer wife Inge Morath and friends. Their daughter, Rebecca Miller, the writer and filmmaker, was raised here for part of her childhood, in room 614, where Henri Cartier-Bresson sometimes read her bedtime stories and the Grateful Dead lived next door, smoking pot and having three-day-long parties with bus-loads of groupies.</p> <p>When Singer, 43, was growing up in Oakland, California, in the 1970s, \"with the surrealism of hippie culture, the violence of the Manson Family killings and the SLA [Symbionese Liberation Army] and Patty Hearst kidnapping happening in our backyard,\" she lost herself in fashion magazines. Seduced by the myths of Studio 54 and the Factory, she \"wanted to work for Warhol's Interview magazine and wrote him letters. I love that whole world - the beat Generation, Allen Ginsberg, Gregory Corso. I was absorbed by the fabulousness of it,\" she says. \"So it was inevitable that this is where I should live.\" </p> <p>\"Actually, it was my idea to come to the Chelsea,\" O'Neill says, throwing his wife a knowing glance. \"Sally made it happen. I had the outsider's sense of possibility.\" </p> <p>O'Neill met Singer in 1991 when she was his editor at the publisher Farrar, Straus and Giroux on his first book, This Is the Life, shortly after graduating in law from Cambridge. They lived in Stockwell, south London, and upgraded to Soho while he worked as a barrister, mainly defending death-row prisoners in the Commonwealth. She worked for the London Review of Books and later British Vogue. Moving to New York, they expected to stay briefly and rented a seventh-floor, one-bedroom apartment in the Chelsea, shifting to a bigger place upstairs when Malachy was born in 1999.</p> <p>After two more sons followed - Pascal, now seven, and Oscar, five - they left the hotel. \"You know, some people leave because of the mice, some because of the cockroaches and others because of the people in the elevator,\" says O'Neill. \"For us, it was sheer practicality. We thought our life had to assume a more adult size.\" So they bought \"an adult-size, eight-bedroom Victorian\" in Flatbush, one of the not-so-fashionable parts of Brooklyn, and spent months renovating it. </p> <p>O'Neill \"liked the light, the summer roses, the horse chestnuts\" and melting-pot neighbourhood. The boys and the cat enjoyed \"having a garden, lots of stairs and rooms to run and hide in. They loved the ice-cream truck that went down the street.\" But Singer was miserable and felt isolated from her Manhattan friends.</p> <p>\"I thought I was living the life that my parents hoped for,\" she says. \"but when I showed them the house they were disappointed. They're so used to coming to see me in seedy neighbourhoods with two rooms and a bed that pulls out of the wall. I know many English people think children need gardens, country houses to escape to. I don't want that. I think there's too much stuff in the world. You're not light on your feet and can't go at any moment.\"</p> <p>Within months, Singer was desperate to return. O'Neill reluctantly agreed. \"Well, you know,\" he sighs good-naturedly, \"if your wife says to you, 'I don't want to live here any more,' what are the options?\" After 18 months, they sold the house and returned to their old flat, knocking together an adjacent studio to create a three-bedroom apartment, for which they pay $5,000 (\u00a32,600) a month in rent. </p> <p>\"It surprised me how attached I am to the Chelsea,\" says Singer. I cried for days when we left. It's a village that I feel at home in. The residents feel they live in a sprawling extended house. We often have dinner with our neighbours. Last Thanksgiving, she \"made a feast for 30. We cooked here and moved upstairs to my friend Susan's for dinner. Then we went up to Gerald's top-floor apartment, which has a roof garden, for drinks.\" </p> <p>Some thrive on the buzz of communal living. Others come here to disappear. O'Neill and Singer are drawn by the diversity of the Chelsea hotel, which is like New York itself - dark, crumbling and colourful - a microcosm of Manhattan, where everyone has a story. </p> <p>\"These days, to rent and not buy is a radical act. We chose to rent this place instead of buying an apartment elsewhere and we don't have anything to show for it. A lot of people find that unacceptable,\" says O'Neill.</p> <p>But don't they love their life here? \"Yeah, exactly,\" he beams. \"How do you place a value on happiness? You'll never have a conversation about real estate in this hotel. And that's because the owner, Stanley Bard, has created this extraordinary community that reflects his whimsies and his peculiar, rather crazed priorities.\"</p> <p>They speak of Bard with warmth and frustration. He was ousted by his two partners last year after running the hotel for 50 years, helping many brilliant artists along the way. The change in management, stream of evictions and public disputes have left many residents worried that the Chelsea will be turned into just another boutique hotel. \"It's a fake war,\" O'Neill says philosophically. \"We just have to ride it out.\"</p> <p>In a world where imitation is celebrated, the Chelsea is a bulwark against conformity. As Arthur Miller wrote, \"This hotel does not belong to America. There are no vacuum cleaners, no rules and no shame.\"</p> <p>\"It's a grounding place and it defines my existence in New York,\" says Singer. She describes how Hiroya, a Japanese artist who paid his way through life with his paintings, left several works of art to the hotel before dying of a heroin overdose a few years ago. One of his paintings, which hangs between the seventh and eighth floors, has writing scrawled across it that translates as: \"From here, it's heaven.\" \"That's how we feel,\" she adds. \"I can't imagine living anywhere else.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>Wednesday June 4: The Clifton pub, St John's Wood, London</strong></p> <p>I find Rhys Ifans and Dafydd \"Daf\" Ieuan hiding behind their sunglasses in a London pub's beer garden, working their way through some bottles of cider. Would Ifans like some crisps or anything? \"Oh no,\" he replies quickly. \"No, no. No solids.\" The Welsh pair - not shy about their enjoyment of drink or drugs - are here to talk about the band they've formed with eight sometime musicians, mostly from Cardiff. They are called The Peth, which means \"thing\" in Welsh. It is also in-band slang for cocaine. </p> <p>Ieuan's normal source of employment is as the drummer in Super Furry Animals. Ifans is an actor, the scruffily charismatic star of Notting Hill and Enduring Love. They're a bit fuzzy on exactly how long they've known each other, but they think it's around 25 years, their friendship dating back to a Cardiff flat-share in the very early days of the Super Furry Animals, and a good few years before Ifans made his big-screen debut in 1997's Twin Town, a film routinely described as \"the Welsh Trainspotting\". </p> <p>\"I was kind of homeless at the time,\" says Ifans, \"so Daf offered that I sleep in his studio.\" Briefly, Ifans sang with an embryonic incarnation of the Super Furries, and they attempted to record some demos. \"But we passed out, didn't we?\" recalls Ieuan. \"And we had to stop recording.\"</p> <p>Ieuan went on to make eight studio albums with the Welsh indie-psychedelic band; Ifans has just finished shooting the latest film from Richard Curtis, The Boat That Rocked, about British pirate radio. After The Peth's autumn tour he's playing the title role in an adaptation of Welsh drug-smuggler Howard Marks's bestselling autobiography Mr Nice. \"There's gonna be a lot of dope smoking,\" the actor says with a grin. \"That's gonna stretch me!\"</p> <p>But, through the years, their friendship remained firm. When Ieuan began writing songs for an album, a collection called The Golden Mile that hymns the praises of a stretch of Cardiff road where you can buy all your store-cupboard staples (\"Food, beer, plectrums, strings, drugs, whatever\"), he decided to ask Ifans if he'd like to sing them. Who better to front a set of beery but tuneful songs that evoke the best bits of Oasis, Happy Mondays and the Super Furries than the man commonly referred to as \"Britain's most rock'n'roll actor\"? The album's lead single says it all. It's called Let's Go Fucking Mental.</p> <p>Which brings us to the other reason Ifans is hiding out at the back of a quiet pub this afternoon. The off-duty behaviour - boozing, partying, gobbing at the paparazzi - of this fully paid-up member of the Primrose Hill set often propels him into the pages of the tabloids. But Ifans' value to the red-tops has rocketed since he began going out with Sienna Miller in mid-2007. And since they split up, it's zoomed higher still. With unfortunate timing, the news that Miller, 26, reportedly dumped Ifans, 40, by telephone has appeared in The Sun this very morning. She, it is said, caught him going through her texts; he, apparently, was suspicious of her friendship with Matthew Rhys, her co-star in The Edge Of Love; she, allegedly, couldn't cope with his jealousy.</p> <p>Mucky and deeply personal stuff for sure, and it goes some way to explaining Ifans' wobbly demeanour and slurred diction, if not the fact that he's turned up to the interview without any shoes. </p> <p><strong>Wednesday July 2: Portmeirion Town Hall, Portmeirion, Wales </strong></p> <p>We are in Sir Clough Williams-Ellis's model village. The Peth are playing their first-ever gig in the town hall, the opening leg of a five-date tour of the Welsh hinterlands. In the foyer the merchandise stall is selling T-shirts that say \"Pwy Ffwc Di'r Peth?\" (\"Who The Fuck Are The Peth?\").</p> <p>Underneath a vaulted 17th-century ceiling depicting the labours of Hercules, the band pile through their 50-minute set. Ifan clutches a can of Fosters and hangs on to the microphone stand for dear life. Behind the singers, Ieuan plays a Fender Telecaster; it's the first time he's played guitar in public. He, like Ifans, is wearing shades. A couple of the musicians he's recruited appear to be playing little more than their knees. For Last Man Standing, The Peth are joined by an eleventh musician, on banjo. They sing Let's Go Fucking Mental, which they describe as a \"beer chucker\" anthem, with Ifans screaming the word \"mental!\" 27 times as the song clatters to a halt. All told, it should be a disaster. In fact, it's brilliant. Like the Happy Mondays, the band have a shambolic magnetism, the sheer strength of their tunes providing a centre of gravity in all the chaos.</p> <p>In the pub in London I had asked Ifans about the lyrics to Last Man Standing, which, melody-wise, is a breezy pop song: \"If I only had my crack pipe it just might have kept me sane\", it begins, \"instead of picking up the toaster and toasting half my brain.\" Can he remember how those lyrics came up?</p> <p>\"Uh, I can, yeah...\" begins Ifans. \"It was during the time when I was hanging out with Pete Doh...\" He stops and scratches his Worzel Gummidge hair. \"It was... It came...\"</p> <p>Was it inspired by the environment you were in at the time?</p> <p>\"No, it was inspired by the cult...\" He tails off again.</p> <p>The cult of Pete Doherty?</p> <p>\"No, the cult, the culture of that time... That whole obsession with... The crack pipe has never kept anyone sane. There's a lot of stuff in there that is very raw, lyrically. And there's a lot of stuff that is just complete and utter situationist mischief.\"</p> <p>What category does that line fall into?</p> <p>\"Em...\" Ifans pauses. \"Mischief,\" he says finally, twice. \"We had this debate when we were writing lyrics: are we swearing too much? Not because we think swearing is wrong, but is it lazy?\" In the end, The Peth's attitude to lyrics can be summed up as \"Oh, just keep it in. We're not Radiohead,\" says Ifans with his lazy, vulpine smile. \"We're not poets.\"</p> <p>The day after Portmeirion, The Peth hit the small town of Bala. And Bala hits them back: Rhys Ifans gets in a fight with a local chip-shop owner, while two other members of the band are visited in their hotel room by the local constabulary. There is, as Ifans later describes it, \"claret all over the room.\" The police tell The Peth to \"have some breakfast, have a drink, and get out of town.\"</p> <p><strong>Thursday July 10: Blossom Street Studios and Hoxton Square Bar &amp; Kitchen, Shoreditch, London</strong></p> <p>The Peth straggle into a studio for the Weekend photoshoot. Rhys Ifans is wearing many of the same clothes he had on the previous week. But his T-shirt is new. With evident pride he says that a couple of fans made it for him. \"Ccadw Dy Fw*in Fish\" (\"Stuff Your Fucking Fish\"), it says, which is what - according to the papers - \"jilted star\" Ifans shouted at the Bala chip-shop owner.</p> <p>Nine-tenths of The Peth are wearing sunglasses. The only one who isn't is the one who's not actually in the band; he's a mate, and he's pretending to be the drummer, who's gone awol. </p> <p>\"It's the first time I've been on stage as me,\" reflects Ifans, of the Welsh shows. \"And this may sound such a naff thing, but in the initial daze of nervousness, because I didn't have a character, the sunglasses became so important. I did two gigs in girls' pink sunglasses. I've got to wean myself off the shades.\"</p> <p>Everyone drinks Kronenbourg, which has been hastily fetched by a studio assistant. Someone is rolling a joint. The attention span of this dirty near-dozen is not lengthy. A lone voice suggests they all stand in a long line for the photographer \"and someone will snort you\". </p> <p>\"I'll do that!\" bellows Ifans.</p> <p> The video for Let's Go Fucking Mental is being made by artists Jake and Dinos Chapman. \"I was hoping they'd just give me a mannequin with a cock coming out its head... We do share a very similar sense of humour,\" says Ifans. </p> <p>They first met when all three were hired by Italian fashion label Missoni. \"They do horrible clothes, but they wanted non-model models and they flew us out to Milan and said you can have some free clobber. Well, I'll go anywhere for free clobber. So it was me, Jake and Dinos and some other people I didn't know, and we had to do a catwalk show. We could barely walk in a straight line. </p> <p>\"So they're old friends,\" he continues. \"And I'm a fan of their work. But they wouldn't have offered to do this if they didn't like the music. They're very particular people.\"</p> <p>In fact, the Peth video commission - the first the brothers have accepted - is something of a favour returned. The Chapmans are currently making their own quasi-autobiographical film, featuring Ifans as their dad and Samantha Morton as their mum (next year, Ifans will also star in the brothers' first \"proper\" film, as an art critic). In return, Ifans asked if the Chapmans would make The Peth's music video.</p> <p>Ifans pulls up a still from the Chapmans' biopic on his mobile phone. It shows him and Morton standing beneath a giant model of a vaginal passage.</p> <p>Ifans says: \"It's the first time in my life where I'm not the biggest cunt in the room.\" </p> <p>Photoshoot quickly over, the band straggle out for the short walk to the Hoxton Square Bar &amp; Kitchen, venue for tonight's London debut. Their guest list numbers 260. \"Yeah,\" sniffs Ifans, \"if you want to rob Primrose Hill, tonight's the night.\"</p> <p>Sure enough, when The Peth take to the stage in the tiny sweat box, the audience includes Kate Moss and Sadie Frost dancing at the front, while The Charlatans' Tim Burgess and former Libertine Carl Bar\u00e2t linger near the back. </p> <p>As in Portmeirion, the gig teeters on the edge of sozzled chaos: on Let's Go Fucking Mental, Ifans manages to scream \"mental!\" only 17 times, while on bluesy ballad Stonefinger he seems to lose the plot entirely.</p> <p><strong>Monday July 28: Final Cut edit suite and Soho House, Soho, London</strong></p> <p>Is Stonefinger about you-know-who? The opening lines are: \"Every little thing you said would break me, all of it came true / Every bit of love I give, you mock it, yes you do...\" </p> <p>Thus far, I've been loth to mention Sienna Miller. In Portmeirion, a journalist from music magazine Q asked Ifans about his ex; Ifans responded by walking out. But at our first meeting, in the pub, when I suggested that Ifans sounds completely broken when he sings Stonefinger, he replied: \"I was, I was in a bad way... Heartbroken. It's a diary, in a way, this album. Coz I've been through several states of mind through the process...\" </p> <p>The Golden Mile has taken the best part of two years to make, with studio sessions in Cardiff fitted around other commitments. On the day they recorded Stonefinger, Ifans \"fell off the train, fell into the room, Daf stuck a mic in my face, I thought it was a fucking ice-cream, I was that off me head.\" </p> <p>Since Stonefinger's public unveiling in Portmeirion, The Sun - alongside splashes about Miller and her supposed new beau Balthazar Getty - have been reporting that the song is about Miller.</p> <p>Ieuan says that he wrote half the album's lyrics on his own, but Ifans wrote some bits and bobs, including Stonefinger. While Ifans is off on the phone I ask Ieuan which lines are about Miller. \"None whatsoever,\" he replies emphatically. When Ifans returns, I ask him to tell me about Stonefinger.</p> <p>\"I'd split up with me girlfriend. No, no, not the little one,\" he says, meaning Miller, adding that the lyrics are approximately 18 months old. So are any of the album's lyrics about... \"No, no, fuck no,\" he interjects. \"Jesus Christ, no. She doesn't deserve a fucking song, that one.\" </p> <p>It's lunchtime, and we're on the roof terrace of Soho House. Ifans was unsure if we'd get in; he thought he might still be banned from the private members' club after an \"incident\" involving a \"small fire\". But Jake Chapman has smoothed our passage. </p> <p>We had met at an edit suite earlier in the day to see a rough-cut of the Chapmans' video. There had been no sign of Ifans - Ieuan had last seen him at four that morning, going off with \"some bird\". He finally rolls in nearly an hour late, full of apologies and with the address of the edit suite written on a pink, heart-shaped Post-it note pinned to his chest. His underpants are poking out of his back pocket.</p> <p>The current public view of Ifans, as filtered through the papers, is of a brokenhearted, unhinged man partying his way through a break-up, his bonkers band a convenient excuse for rock'n'roll excess. </p> <p>\"Absolutely,\" he says, the band has been a refuge during his recent troubles. \"It all had a kind of poetic symmetry. I'm not the kind to lie down on a couch... This band was bang on the right time.\" His impulse was to think, \"right, I'm going back to gang life.\" </p> <p>But for all the shambling mess that seems to attend him, like the dustcloud hovering above Peanuts' Pig-Pen, Ifans is serious about The Peth, and serious about it not being seen as a dilettantish excursion by a bored thespian. \"This is a proper band,\" he and Ieuan chorus. No one wants Ifans's celebrity status to get in the way - even though it inevitably does.</p> <p>At Soho House The Peth drink cider and Ifans waves his underpants about. Chapman goes off home, motorbike helmet in hand; unbeknown to him, Ifans has secreted his pants inside.</p> <p>In a short while, Chapman returns, and it's on to the pub, followed by Soho House again. And it's only six o'clock in the evening. I leave soon afterwards, waking up on a bus, some distance past my house, without my bag containing my laptop, iPod, house keys, sunglasses. The next day I make frantic phone calls to the rest of our party, trying to retrieve it. Apparently, most headed home in the early evening but Ifans and Chapman kept going. We know this because Ifans is in the next day's papers, careering out of nightclub Bungalow 8 at 3.30am, straight into another fight with photographers. The stories report that he spent the evening with Rod Stewart's daughter Kimberly - another attempt, they suggest, to \"bounce back from his split from Sienna Miller.\" </p> <p>Then Ifans disappears. For two days. No one can reach him - except the long arm of the tabloid lens. They photograph him and Stewart leaving her house and having \"nosh in a seedy Soho strip club\". </p> <p>Many phone calls later, I finally receive word that Ifans has my bag. Remarkably, everything is there. Except my sunglasses. I text Jake Chapman to thank him for all his efforts in trying to locate Ifans and my bag. Shame about the glasses, I say, but in the circumstances, it's not surprising they've been lost.</p> <p>Chapman texts back. \"Think you'll find your glasses on the front page of most tabloids...\"</p> <p>I look online. Sure enough, there on The Sun's Bizarre pages is Rhys Ifans, strolling with his latest flame, wearing my sunglasses. At the time of writing, he still hadn't returned them. Not weaned off the sunglasses yet, then.</p>",
  "<p>I would have thought my mobile phone bills come a pretty long way down the list of environmental threats facing the Earth. Still, every little helps and maybe it would have been green to stop getting paper bills. That, after all, was the reason Virgin Mobile, part of the Richard Branson conglomerate, gave customers when it recently introduced a \u00a31 per month charge to those who would not agree to receive their bills electronically. </p> <p>I must admit the teeniest bit of scepticism about Branson's commitment to saving the environment. Paper bills are not quite up there with running a long-distance airline - never mind competing to get into outer space - when it comes to causing global warming. Virgin Mobile's idea of sponsorship doesn't involve the usual \"green\" things like woods, rivers or small wild animals, but it does sponsor the Big Brother television programme.</p> <p>I have no objection to having phone bills emailed to me, but Virgin has not exactly developed a user-friendly method of receiving them. The procedure is so time-consuming that by the time I have completed it, the saving of \u00a31 means I am probably \"working\" at less than the minimum wage rate.</p> <p>I was also a little perturbed that this commendable attempt to reduce paper waste was being taken by one of the main purveyors of junk mail to our home. </p> <p>Scarcely a week goes by without some missive trying to persuade us to fly more on Branson's airline or change to his broadband company. I emailed Virgin Mobile's managing director, Graham Oxby, saying I would agree to his proposed change of terms, if Virgin would agree to allow me to make a deduction from my bill for each piece of junk mail sent to our house.</p> <p>I was phoned a few days later by a very polite chap called James who told me Virgin Mobile could not stop other Virgin companies sending their mailings. He did not really engage with my point that as most of the companies have the same chairman or president it would be remarkably easy to give an instruction to all of them to stop junk mailing anybody. </p> <p>All James could do was stop Virgin Mobile, and its apparently related broadband company, junk mailing me. Even those companies would not stop sending their letters to my wife unless she personally asked them to stop it. It would appear she, like most of the population have, in Virgin's eyes, a divine right to receive junk mail. </p> <p>Virgin and I are in something of a legal grey area: I have not agreed to pay the \u00a31 charge, though that has not stopped it helping itself to the sum through my direct debit. It has not agreed to pay my charges. The best analysis is probably that the contract continues on the original terms with neither Virgin nor me being entitled to charge in respect of mailings.</p> <p>As corporate misbehaviour goes this is relatively mild stuff. No real harm to anyone is done by the \u00a31 charge and its junk mail is no more than a minor irritant to those who receive it. </p> <p>For blatant hypocrisy, though, it has few rivals. A few dozen more customers refusing to pay the charge would probably make it unworkable and inflict upon Virgin the chaos some might think such a display of double standards deserves. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Richard Colbey is a barrister</p>",
  "<h2>Which country has the best diplomats?</h2> <p>Life as a diplomat is not all Ferrero-Rocher chocolates and cocktail parties, and it will take more than smooth talking to clear up the mess after the war over South Ossetia. But was David Miliband, the foreign secretary, right to call this a crisis which needs \"British values and British diplomacy\"? The UK is on the hawkish side of the EU debate, blaming Moscow for \"blatant aggression\", though it did urge Georgia to act with restraint in the face of Russian provocation.</p> <p>Britain still punches above its weight as one of the five permanent members of the UN security council. It has a veto, but few chances to use it. The fact that Russia (and China) also sit at the world's \"top table\" limits the scope for coercive diplomacy, especially as the punitive measures being mooted would hurt others more than Russia.</p> <p>The Foreign Office used to be seen as the Rolls-Royce of diplomatic services and did not take kindly to the suggestion a decade ago that it be replaced by a fax machine. Still, important diplomatic business is now conducted directly between capitals rather than embassies, or via presidential prime ministers like Tony Blair. The FO was perceived as having appeased the Serbs during the Balkan wars of the early 1990s. The fiasco of Iraq and its non-existent WMD did not cover it in glory either.</p> <p>French diplomacy can be steely, and it was the flamboyant Nicolas Sarkozy who flew to Moscow to secure the Georgia ceasefire. Germany is well-connected in the Caucasus and appreciated in the Arab world. The EU has not yet got its own diplomats though its Spanish foreign policy chief, Javier Solana, has taken the lead in dealing with Iran's nuclear ambitions. Turkey has proved a useful mediator between Israel and Syria. Could this crisis be the hour of the Nordics? Sweden's foreign minister, Carl Bildt, flew to Tiblisi on behalf of the Council of Europe. His Finnish colleague, Alexander Stubb, representing the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, is a former EU policy wonk who makes even the famously brainy Miliband look dim by comparison. <br><strong>Ian Black</strong></p> <h2>Why is sterling falling against the dollar?</h2> <p>If you are thinking about jetting to New York for a cheap shopping spree courtesy of the strong pound, you've left it too late. Sterling has completed its 11th straight daily fall against the US currency - something that has not happened for 37 years. It has fallen from a peak of just over $2.10 last year to about $1.85 in London yesterday and looks likely to fall further.</p> <p>Three big factors lie behind the pound's weakness. The first is that the dollar has been getting stronger because foreign exchange dealers believe the Federal Reserve will soon raise interest rates to combat inflation. Higher rates attract flows of investment into a currency, thus pushing up its value.</p> <p>The second is a growing belief in the markets that the Bank of England will be forced to cut the cost of borrowing in the UK in response to the threat of recession. When the Bank said on Wednesday that it saw inflation falling sharply next year and growth grinding to a halt, sterling dropped by 3 cents against the dollar. The gap between interest rates in the UK and the US is wide - 5% compared with 2% - but dealers expect it to narrow. That said, the downward trend in the value of sterling started well before the Bank released its inflation report, suggesting that the markets are looking at the UK and not liking what they see. </p> <p>Over the past 10 years, the UK has run ever-bigger trade deficits, financed by the speculative flows of capital that came flooding into London when global markets were booming. The credit crunch has meant those flows have dried up and the markets have realised that the UK's trade deficit is unsustainable. This looks like reality checkpoint. <br><strong>Larry Elliott</strong></p> <h2>Should we listen to thinktanks?</h2> <p>The short answer is yes, with serious provisos. Thinktanks are the public equivalent of the chattering classes. They provide excellent debating points at dinner parties. They raise controversial issues of the day. They can influence people, particularly the \"movers and shakers\" who make political decisions. They are usually staffed by bright, young things who enjoy putting over controversial views. The people who staff thinktanks tend to go on to stand as MPs, become directors of companies or charities or advise people in government.</p> <p>The serious proviso is to make sure you don't take their views as gospel. They often come from a particular political perspective - authoritarian or libertarian - right of centre or left of centre. So the type of report they commission aims to promote that point of view. The Adam Smith Institute - well on the libertarian right - would never commission a report on, say, nationalising utilities or turning the railways into non-profit making organisations. Yet the left of centre Fabian Society has published a study proposing that Scotrail become a not-for-profit company.</p> <p>There is a pecking order in thinktanks, too, and some are more influential than others. The Adam Smith Institute and the Centre for Policy Studies had their heyday in setting the Thatcherite agenda. Demos and the Institute for Public Policy Research were at their zenith influencing Tony Blair's agenda. And the centre-right Policy Exchange is one of the main drivers for influencing David Cameron's Tories.</p> <p>So the controversy over its latest report on the failure of the regeneration of Northern cities, written by a Liberal Democrat adviser and denounced as \"barmy\" by Cameron, is an exception to the rule - though it is firmly in the centre right's domain by querying whether too much public money has been spent.</p> <p>There is one other point about thinktanks - to be really effective they should have a limited shelf life. One senior Tory told me they usually run out of steam after 20 years. <br> <strong>David Hencke</strong></p>",
  "<p>The very term gap year is a misnomer; it implies a space to be filled, something passively waiting rather than a period when a young adult will be actively constructing an identity and taking responsibility for their own lives in a way unlikely to be matched by friends going straight to university or college. There is a lot of learning in a gap year: meeting and judging new people, learning to assess risky situations, and taking responsibility for your actions. Parents might, if you are lucky, top up your funding, but they won't be there to get you out of sticky situations.</p> <p>What kind of gap year is for you, if any? Six months on a beach in Thailand might be fun, but what is it going to do for you, the person? Are you going to get more out of it by being on your own and forced into making new friends? Or will you just be lonely? If you travel with friends, is that just going to be the sixth form in a tropical environment? Do you have to leave the UK? Answer these questions and see if you can work out the kind of gap experience that will most benefit you.</p> <p><strong>Your parents tell you that to celebrate finishing your A-levels they will take you on a holiday to a place of your choice. Your immediate thought is:</strong></p> <p>a) A month clubbing in Thailand - it will be wild and it will be easy to give the olds the slip</p> <p>b) They tell me now! It's going to take me at least 10 weeks to research all my options</p> <p>c) Great, I've always wanted to visit Machu Picchu and Mum and Dad are paying; it will look so cool on my CV</p> <p>d) Fantastic; we can visit all those wild, remote places in the UK and it will really give us time to be a family together</p> <p><strong>Your loving aunt is worried about how you will cope catering for yourself when you finally go to university. You reassure her by telling her:</strong></p> <p>a) Don't worry, there are lots of cheap ethnic food markets around the campus, I am planning to try them all and I'm bound to learn how to cook eventually - how hard can it be?</p> <p>b) Don't worry, I've set a budget and sorted out the best places to buy cheaply and healthily</p> <p>c) Relax - I am planning to get work related to my course so money won't be a problem, I can eat out</p> <p>d) It's OK; I'll only be 100 miles away so I can get a cheap coach home and raid my parents' food supplies</p> <p><strong>You receive a text on your phone that has clearly been sent to the wrong number.

What a gap experience will do, though, is change you; your outlook, your attitudes, your plans will all be informed by the experiences you have had and things you have seen. You will have had to develop personal responsibility and independence. Travelling may even get to be a habit; if your first port of call when you arrive at university is the office of the Erasmus/Socrates or study abroad coordinator, you'll know you caught something really infectious while you were away.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Dr Jane Prince is principal lecturer in the psychology department at the University of Glamorgan</p> <h2>How did you score?</h2> <p><strong>Mostly a)s</strong></p> <p>You are the person of whom everyone thinks when they think of gap years. You are someone who values spontaneity and embraces the unknown. Your gap year will just happen; the round-the-world ticket with no pre-planned stops is purchased and you are ready to go. If a single place appeals to you, then you could stay there for the whole year - or just wander to a different place every week. Who knows. You need to explore what you want to get out of your gap year, to go with all the photos and memories. Don't search for the exciting just for the sake of stimulation; life is sometimes calm and mundane and yet still enjoyable.</p> <p><strong>Mostly b)s</strong></p> <p>You like to plan ahead, so you would probably be attracted to a structured experience such as those provided by commercial companies. These can be expensive and some feel a bit \"packaged\". You could try to find local charities that take volunteers if they have certain skills, and then apply yourself to acquiring those skills. Or apply to one of the UN projects where young people from two countries spend several months working together on a local community project. But give yourself time for a bit of spontaneity, too - it will give you confidence in your ability to deal with uncertainties. And life is filled with these.</p> <p><strong>Mostly c)s</strong></p> <p>You would like your gap year to relate to your career plans. You might be planning actual employment relating to your anticipated career. Try to think outside the box, too, and look for transferable skills; these might be organisational (getting visas and tickets coordinated takes some skill), communication (persuading that office manager in Ulan Bator to give you a job) or even practical. Take the opportunity to learn a new language and you will demonstrate to a future employer not just a useful skill but also your capacity for tenacity and hard work.</p> <p><strong>Mostly d)s</strong></p> <p>You are the kind of person who sees no great benefit in being a long way from home; you enjoy finding out more about your own community. Talk of a gap year tends to invoke an image of far-flung and exotic places, so your initial thoughts might be that a gap year isn't for you. Why not consider spending some time working and travelling in one of the most beautiful islands in the world? There are opportunities to work in a range of paid occupations (including community projects) and get to meet other international travellers. And at the end of a gap year in Britain, you could even reward yourself with a couple of weeks' holiday on a sunny beach somewhere.</p>",
  "<p>Ribena was the superior fruit drink of my youth, and over the years I've consumed a fair amount of blackcurrants in liquid form, though more as cassis in kir and the like. I've even tried to make cassis with blackcurrants from the solitary bush in my garden, but it wasn't a success. But until meeting Edward Thompson, engineer, fruit farmer and guiding force of Pixley Berries, I'd never given much thought to cordial production or growing blackcurrants on a large scale. </p> <p>And here they were, row upon row of them, different varieties with different qualities, with names such as Ben Hope, Ben Tirran, Ben Gairn and Pixley Black, 300 acres of them in all. There were raspberries and apples, too, but the blackcurrants are the backbone of this business.</p> <p>\"Ribena is God,\" Thompson said. He's a tall man, with unruly, white hair, a ruddy face and an insistent enthusiasm for his products. \"It's easy to criticise them, but they've put a lot of money into research and development. And we supply them with a lot of blackcurrants. But Ribena is a clear cordial, which means it's been refined to take out the natural cloudiness of the juice. And the more you refine something, the more you take out the flavour. And I'm preoccupied by flavours. Pixley Berries cordial is cloudy, and I'd say it packs more flavour.\"</p> <p>Thompson is especially fond of the Pixley Black, which he selected after a worldwide search, having become concerned about the effect that global warming was having on the seasons (less winter chill, more summer heat). This, he felt, is a superior blackcurrant - superior in flavour, that is, not in productivity. \"Here,\" he said, stripping off a handful of plump berries, \"try them.\" </p> <p>They burst easily in my mouth, and sent the sweet/sour juice gushing down my throat. The flavour was as full and rich as the fruit looked. \"See?\" Thompson said.</p> <p>The thing about blackcurrants, it seems, is not only do different varieties taste different - \"The question is, do they taste good?\" Thompson said - but they have different ripening times, because they have different time clocks and respond differently to different temperatures, which differ according to which field they grow in, because fields have different microclimates. \"Vive la diff\u00e9rence,\" Thompson said.</p> <p>No, his currants aren't organic. For all its robust flavour, the blackcurrant is a delicate shrub, prone to spider mite, leaf spot and aphids, but they'd cut down pesticides and built a cordon sanitaire of hedgerow and grass around each field to promote bird life and insects that feed on insects that would otherwise infest the crop.</p> <p>Then, from July to August, pickers strip the fruit from the bushes, using machinery that Thompson adapted for the purpose - in a former incarnation, he had an engineering business. The pickers, as seems customary these days, come from eastern Europe, in some cases two or more generations of them. (It makes you wonder what will become of British agriculture, not to mention our restaurants, hotels and hospitals, when the xenophobia promoted by a sad alliance of cheap politicians and cheaper newspapers reduces the flow of itinerant labour on which we rely to do the jobs we are too lazy or too snooty to do ourselves. But that is by the by.)</p> <p>Then it's off to the juicing plant, all gleaming stainless steel and the heady smell of fruit. Even here, the fruit is treated with kid gloves, allowing time for maceration and natural filtration, so that the cordials retain the oomph of the natural fruit, ready for bottling as pure blackcurrant cordial, or mixed with juice from the farm's Cox's apples or elderflower or Scottish raspberry juice. Or champagne, cider, white wine or gin, come to that. (\"We do try to be different,\" Thompson said. \"We have to.\") Or poured over ice cream. Or... well, I'm sure you get the picture.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Score </strong> 9.25/10 <br><strong>Telephone</strong> 020-7437 9585 <br><strong>Address </strong>26-29 Dean Street, London W1 <br><strong>Open</strong> Monday-Saturday, lunch 12-2.45pm, dinner 5-10.45pm</p> <p>Anyone looking to this column for help in resolving the age-old struggle for supremacy between nurture and nature (and it's hardly for me to second-guess the readers' motivation) is in for a brutal disappointment.</p> <p>Today's restaurant is Quo Vadis, which stands in the heart of London's dismally sanitised Soho, as it has done for some 80 years. Previously the upstairs bit was Karl Marx's workplace, and these rooms' present incarnation as a private members' club for moneyed media types, vaguely on the lines of the one a few doors up opened by Karl's cousin Groucho, is an irony that needn't detain us today.</p> <p>What need detain us is that in the 1990s Quo Vadis was taken over by a syndicate including my old schoolmate Matthew Freud. Matthew, as you know, is frequently cited by those on the nurture side of the debate as the single most compelling argument against the power of heredity. Times beyond counting I've challenged Steve Jones, Richard Dawkins and other top-ranked geneticists to explain the progression, in just three generations, from Sigmund to Matthew via Clement, and never have they dared take up the gauntlet. </p> <p>One up to upbringing over environment there, then. The equaliser, however, comes from the latest owners of Quo Vadis, Sam and Eddie Hart. These brothers are the sons of gifted restaurateurs themselves, their parents owning Hambleton Hall, a country house hotel and restaurant in Rutland about which people have long raved. </p> <p>Now this might tempt some to chalk up another to nurture, on the obvious grounds that growing up in that world inevitably imbued the boys with their parents' abilities. I won't have it. The outstanding restaurateur is too rare a creature to be explained by environmental influences. The gift is as much bred in the bone as one for football, and these Harts are the Charlton brothers of the food world. It's true that they have yet to fall out for opaque reasons connected with their mother Cissie, but in any British squad for the Restaurateur World Cup a place would have to be found for both because they bring to their work flair, passion, perfectionism and the surest of touches.</p> <p>At Quo Vadis, their first major non-Hispanic venture after opening the admired Spanish restaurant Fino and the even more vaunted tapas joint Barrafina, both stalked the room, eyes slaking from side to side in the quest for problems in the manner of the masters of the trade Chris Corbin and Jeremy King (The Wolseley). Eventually they settled down for a late afternoon digestif with my so-called rival Giles Coren, who was taking a well-merited break from composing his much-loved lyrical odes to the subeditors of the Times, but if they'd hunted down and resolved any failings during their travels around the parquet floor, they certainly weren't at our table. In fact the entire experience, from the warm and jolly greeting onwards, was pretty much perfect. </p> <p>Whether through good sense or parsimony, they have left this spacious Edwardian room - antique frosted-glass mirrors, low ceilings providing unusually good acoustic - largely untouched, save for some squishy, tan-coloured banquettes and the abstracts on the walls. They have also gone for the sort of unponcey, emulsion-free, old-fashioned British menu that not only goes with the room but makes the heart sing at the sight of at least a dozen dishes you want to eat. </p> <p>My friend kicked off with whitebait, and a finer, more accurately fried serving of that delectable little fish (served with impeccable tartare sauce) he could not remember. I went for the razor clams, those underrated princelings of the seafood world, and these were also superb, arriving enticingly browned in their shells and laced with garlic and parsley.</p> <p>The main courses were better still, thanks to the obvious-sounding but highly unusual synthesis of beautiful meat and accurate cooking. \"I must tell you, this is the lightest, tenderest lamb I've ever eaten,\" enthused my friend of his beautifully pink and milky roast saddle, served in one gratifyingly vast circular slab. I felt the same about a veal cutlet of a meltiness and richness of flavour I couldn't recall. Vegetables were also flawless, the spinach drawing an almost mystified, \"But everything is brilliant here\" from my friend's roseate lips (the pinot grigio turned out to be pink, and delicious with it). </p> <p>Raspberry trifle was slightly too sweet for my embittered palate, but he loved it, and it was worth the money just for the aesthetics. Even the cover charge I alighted on in the quest for a quibble turned out to cover terrific bread and olives and filtered water, which seemed a fair deal for two quid.</p> <p>No, there's nothing for it but to accept this is one of those ultra-rare, spirit-lifting restaurants that has you proselytising its splendours to anyone polite enough to listen. But then these Hart boys do have their forebears' talent stamped throughout their DNA. If only the same could be said for Matthew Freud and that Pedigree Chum-peddling sire of his.</p> <h2>The bill</h2> <p>Whitebait \u00a36.20</p> <p>Razor clams \u00a311</p> <p>Veal cutlet \u00a318</p> <p>Saddle of lamb \u00a317.50</p> <p>Mashed potatoes \u00a34.50</p> <p>Fresh peas \u00a33.50</p> <p>Spinach \u00a34</p> <p>Trifle \u00a36.20</p> <p>Pink pinot grigio \u00a339</p> <p>Calvados \u00a39</p> <p>Espresso \u00a31.75</p> <p>Americano \u00a32.25</p> <p>Two covers \u00a34</p> <p>Subtotal \u00a3126.90</p> <p>Service @ 12.5% \u00a315.86</p> <p><strong>Total: \u00a3142.76</strong></p>",
  "<p><strong>We have lived in a house with a garden for some time but have no experience of making compost. My youngest, aged eight, has been composting at school and is very interested, so we thought we should try it at home. My son wants a wormery, which, frankly, scares me. Is that the same as a compost bin? What are our options? We are a family of five, with three boys aged from eight to 13. Our garden is 100ft by 60ft, mostly consisting of neglected plants and lawn. Most of our waste is household scraps - what is suitable for compost?</strong><br><strong>Kelly Salter, Bath</strong></p> <p>The first thing to do is look at the Recycle Now website (<a href=\"http://www.recyclenow.com\">recyclenow.com</a>). If you go to the home composting section and put in your postcode, it tells you which compost bins your council offers at a reduced rate (note: you may still be able to buy these cheaper at garden centres, so shop around). Plus there's a very good section on what to put in your compost bin and what to leave out. You can also buy wormeries and bokashi systems (more on those later) online but the choice is more limited. </p> <p>A wormery isn't the same as a compost bin. A compost bin/heap is where you can put things such as vegetable peelings, shredded paper and cardboard, garden waste and more - but it's easier for you to look at the online list I mention for dos and don'ts. It requires little maintenance other than turning occasionally, but it can take about two years to produce useable compost. A wormery is usually a tiered system containing worms that munch through your kitchen waste (but not meat or fish) and provide you with liquid fertiliser and worm casts, which will give you useable compost in as little as six months. </p> <p>People either love or hate wormeries. They do need some attention to get right, as you can overfeed them and you have to be careful not to put too much of one type of food in, such as citrus fruit, bananas and onion skins. You need to keep the pH balanced, and there are stories galore about people who just didn't get on with them. Don't let that put you off. It's perfectly do-able for an eight-year-old and your other boys will love it. </p> <p>Then there's something called a bokashi bin. I have a compost heap and a bokashi system. The latter involves putting all your kitchen scraps in - cooked or raw meat and fish included - and sprinkling it with bran that contains microscopic bacteria, yeasts and fungi. (The only kitchen waste you can't put in is teabags but I do - I think it's only if you get through tons in a day.) The bran causes the waste to break down quicker. When one bin is full you store it (the lid is airtight so it doesn't smell, although when you open it it smells of pickling) and start on the next one. In two weeks, the full one is ready to be dug straight into vegetable beds or the compost bin (not just dumped on top) where it will break down much quicker. The ongoing cost of bokashi is the bran (about \u00a315 every six months). You also get liquid fertiliser from bokashi, which you dilute (as with the wormery one) - or you can use it neat to clear drains. </p> <p>You can make do with just a compost heap, otherwise get a wormery or a bokashi system to deal with kitchen waste and use your compost for garden waste. There's a good table online at <a href=\"http://www.greengardener.co.uk/compostingtable.htm\">greengardener.co.uk/compostingtable.htm</a>. I got my bokashi system from there (\u00a359.99 for two bins and 600g of bran) and the service is excellent. It takes you through the pros and cons of each system. </p> <p>As far as a compost bin goes, you have a choice of either a contained bin or an open one. A contained bin looks a bit like a water butt. I find these a bit limited for space. Once you start composting, it's amazing what you can find to add - shredded paper and cardboard (good to stop your heap getting too sludgy), grass clippings, fallen leaves etc. It fills up fast. I would recommend you just make a compost heap and this link tells you how: gardenersworld.com/how-to/projects/compost-bin. </p> <p>Otherwise, Wiggly Wigglers (<a href=\"http://www.Annalisa Barbieri\">wigglywigglers.co.uk</a>, 01981 500391) specialises in wormeries. The Can-o-Worms kit, which is a wormery plus worms, is \u00a389. I haven't dealt with this company but I know lots of people who have and have been very happy with the result. Green Gardener (<a href=\"http://www.greengardener.co.uk\">greengardener.co.uk</a>, 01603 715096) also sells wormeries. The Junior Wormery (ideal to see how you get on with it) is \u00a339.99 for the wormery and worms. Both companies also do interesting compost bins. Have fun. Your dustbins will be practically empty.</p>",
  "<p>At nearly 900 pages, this is a suitably monumental book about the biggest subject of all: the cosmos. This history of our love affair with the stars was first published in 1993. Now, British historian of astronomy John North has updated it and increased the illustrations by about 200. The scale of the subject is daunting: more than 20,000 scholarly articles are published each year on astronomy, and the roots of our fascination lie as far back as 36,000BC. Archaeologists have found bones from that time carved with moon-shaped marks representing the lunar days of the month. As North says, this was the \"first step towards a mathematics of the heavens\". From Stonehenge and ancient China, where sunspots were first recorded in 28BC (European astronomers didn't spot them until the 17th century), to today's search for dark matter, Machos and Wimps, this remarkable work brings together the global history, theories, people and technologies of astronomy to tell a story that \"has very few intellectual parallels in the whole of human history\".</p>",
  "<p>More than 400,000 holidaymakers face severe disruption at the end of the month after staff voted to go on strike at Britain's two busiest airports for charter airlines and low-budget carriers. </p> <p>Union leaders warned that industrial action at Gatwick and Stansted could spread across the UK with workers at Manchester, Birmingham and Newcastle airports also holding walk-out ballots. </p> <p>Baggage handlers and check-in staff at Gatwick and Stansted will stage 24-hour strikes on bank holiday Monday, August 25, and on August 29 after rejecting a 3% pay offer. The strike by workers at airport services firm Swissport will affect services by Gatwick-based airlines including Virgin Atlantic, Thomsonfly, Monarch and First Choice, and flights operated by Ryanair and easyJet at Stansted, where they are the biggest customers.</p> <p>The Unite union said all airlines using Swissport's services would be grounded. \"The flights could not operate. If these strikes go ahead it would effectively shut down the airlines' operations,\" said Steve Turner, Unite's secretary for aviation.</p> <p>Swissport and airport owner BAA were holding talks with airline bosses last night to gauge whether they can keep flights running with a skeleton workforce. Swissport said it hoped to \"minimise disruption to the travelling public\" while one airline, Virgin Atlantic, said it had contingency plans in place and expected \"business as usual\" for its Gatwick flights. Ryanair said it would operate hand-luggage-only flights if the strikes go ahead. </p> <p>Services to Las Vegas, Lanzarote and Malaga will be among the flights affected on August 25 and 29. Industry experts warned that passengers should at least expect delays, if not cancellations, if last-ditch negotiations fail.</p> <p>\"The airlines and Swissport will attempt to draft in management and where possible use non-unionised workers,\" said John Strickland, an airline consultant. \"There will be a risk of delays and this is worst time of year for it to happen, at the peak of the summer season when flights are their fullest.\" Swissport said it intended to continue talks with the Unite and GMB unions over averting the strikes. </p> <p>BAA's much-maligned airports have had an uneventful summer but their vulnerability to operational mishaps was underlined on Thursday, when thousands of passengers at Heathrow's Terminal 3 had to fly without their bags after a computer glitch shut down the baggage handling system. BAA said 3,500 bags were separated from their owners following the software breakdown, which also saw 4,500 passengers ordered to queue outside the terminal after check-in desks were closed. The airport group said airlines had begun reuniting passengers with their bags.</p> <p>Gatwick and Stansted are the UK's second and third largest airports and will handle a total of more than 200,000 passengers a day over the bank holiday weekend. Holidaymakers will be most affected because both airports are popular with charter and low-budget carriers. </p> <p>Unite described the 3% pay offer as an insult and has demanded a pay rise of 5% for its members, in the latest pay dispute to focus on the rising rate of inflation. \"Our members are already struggling to keep up with rising food and energy costs. This pay offer is an insult to professional, hard-working men and women who have to operate in extremely difficult conditions. Our members have had enough,\" said Unite's Turner. </p> <p>A Ryanair spokesman said: \"This strike is totally unjustified. Union chiefs should be grateful that they are getting any increase at all at a challenging time for the global economy.\"</p> <p>Baggage screeners at Stansted have also voted to go on strike, but the airport said services would not be affected. </p> <p>BAA is braced for another blow next week, when the Competition Commission is expected to demand the sale of Gatwick and one Scottish airport. The competition watchdog has indicated BAA's monoply over airports in the south-east is bad for airlines and passengers because it encourages the group to hold back plans for runways and under-invest in services.</p>",
  "<p>Music publisher Chrysalis, whose roster includes Portishead and Estelle, warned yesterday that revenue from song royalties would fall this year as it predicted an annual loss across the group.</p> <p>Chrysalis said net publisher's share (NPS), the royalties it receives after writers, performers and right holders have taken their slice, would be lower in the 13 months to the end of September than for the previous year.</p> <p>It blamed the \"challenging macroeconomic environment\" for hampering sales of CDs. The advertising market downturn affected synchronisation revenue, which it gets when music is used in TV programmes, films and advertisements.</p> <p>Over the 10 months to the end of June, NPS was down 2.9% on last year, reflecting a quiet release schedule in the first half of the year and uncertainty about Chrysalis's future, when it was up for sale. The three months from April to June saw a 12.8% gain, however, thanks to chart hits.</p> <p>Investec analysts predicted NPS would fall 9% year on year to \u00a311.1m for the 13 months to the end of September. Since rejecting a bid from EMI and ending talks with other potential buyers in April, Chrysalis has identified increasing NPS as a significant way to boost shareholder value.</p> <p>Chrysalis said its incubator business Echo, which nurtures artists before they sign with big labels, performed below expectations and is under review with other non-publishing assets. It predicted an operating loss for the 13 months that would be at a similar level to the \u00a31.2m it reported for the seven months to the end of March.</p>",
  "<p>This is it. After 13 years in the musty confines of classrooms, watching life go past the windows while the teacher sincerely tries to interest you in the sex life of daffodils, you're free. All right, if you're planning to go to uni it's only for a year: after that your tutors will be clamping you in another set of dusty arms, but that still gives you a year to change and improve the world on your own terms. </p> <p>And if, like most young people today (57% according to the latest Defra figures), you are fairly worried about climate change, then you may wish to focus your year on the environment. But what is the best way to go about that?</p> <p>Well, the modern gap-year industry, which is becoming more and more commercialised by the day, caters for everything, so it certainly offers a few ecological opportunities. You can sweep off to combat deforestation in Kenya, or help with wallaby conservation in Australia. You might decide that you want to head to the Arctic to monitor carbon stores in the peat, or whisk yourself to the base of Mount Fuji in Japan to search for endangered butterflies. And these are just a few of the options offered by gap-year organisations under the conservation label: some offer construction work, some want you to work with scientific projects; there are opportunities all over the world that sound equally exotic and exciting, with the additional plus of helping the environment. </p> <h2>Carbon footprint</h2> <p>But before you shout \"that's for me, I'm off to save the world\", a moment's sober thought is sadly necessary. Leaving aside the high financial cost, many gap-year packages are for just one or two weeks, and, as we all know these days, the carbon cost of flying to the other side of the world is pretty heavy. The emissions from a return flight to Australia equal the emissions of three average cars for a year: you would really have to save a lot of wallabies to compensate for that kind of impact on your carbon footprint. Even more crucially, how much real difference can you make in two weeks anyway? </p> <p>Kate Simpson runs Ethical Volunteering, a website aimed at helping people to get the most out of their volunteering experience, and she is increasingly concerned about the actual value of some of these projects. \"Some of the big agencies are using the environment as a kind of marketing tool and actually what they're selling are essentially holidays.\" (I noticed that i-to-i, a commercial gap-year organisation now owned by First Choice, advertises projects such as sea turtle conservation in Costa Rica as also being an opportunity to \"live the 'beach' lifestyle\".) </p> <p>\"The rationale behind a lot of these projects is that you're getting people involved and engaged in the environment. But if they're only going out there for two weeks, I don't see how that can be possible,\" adds Simpson, who is also concerned about the scientific basis of some of these projects. \"Some of them are certainly part of authentic scientific research expeditions, but you need to establish very thoroughly before you go that this is the case. What is the organisation you will be working with? Do they have plans to publish their research?\" </p> <p>And even if they are genuine, how useful will you really be? Last year, Tourism Concern did some research into the overseas voluntary industry, and found some worrying results. Many of the organisations gave skimpy answers to questions about the satisfaction of the community hosting the volunteers: it is obvious in many cases that the happiness of the volunteers takes priority over the happiness of the community they are supposed to be helping. And a third of the volunteers who were questioned thought that their placement had been of greater benefit to them than to the community in which they were placed. One volunteer described feeling that \"what I was actually doing wasn't truly benefiting the local community (we did build a playground and they were totally grateful). It was a western ideal and it made me realise that I did it for my own selfish reasons.\"</p> <p>But don't despair. There are plenty of ways of having an exciting, wonderful gap year, seeing whole new parts of the world, keeping your carbon footprint low, not going broke, and really making a difference to the environment. </p> <p>First of all, consider staying closer to home: there are plenty of conservation opportunities in the UK and Europe. Earthwatch, for example, a long-established charity that organises placements with scientific expeditions, has projects off Scotland, while the National Trust and the British Trust of Conservation Volunteers both have green volunteering opportunities. If you're planning to work as well, Phil Murray of Gap Advice suggests do-it.org, a website that will help you choose a volunteering activity that fits in with your working hours. A quick scan shows just how useful this can be: within a few miles of my home in Brighton, for example, I can help to organise the London-Brighton Green Car rally, work with the RSPB, do a few hours at the Peace and Environment centre, sort things out at the Green Library, clean beaches or collect used mobile phones. Or you could get involved in some of the energetic environmental campaigns taking part around the country: groups such as Friends of the Earth, Plane Stupid, Rising Tide, the Climate Camp and Greenpeace are always looking for volunteers for fundraising, newsletter-writing, or non-violent direct action, whichever appeals to you most.</p> <h2>European horizons</h2> <p>If you were at least hoping to leave the country, there is a large landmass usually referred to as Europe, which has a reputation for a fair amount of diversity and complexity. Wwoof (World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms) has been going for over 20 years: it's basically a network where organic farmers looking for help post messages. The possibilities are unbelievable as Wwoof, which started up in England, now stretches around the world. If you want to go somewhere a train-ride away, you could be gathering hazelnuts in Piedmont, Italy, herding goats in the Austrian Tyrol or building a straw-bale house in Asturias, Spain: it's actually quite hard to look through the websites without making immediate plans to set off. Wwoof is an astonishing key to unique experiences.</p> <p>Finally, no one in the world would say you're forbidden from travelling long distances. Sure, flying to South America may be a huge chunk of carbon emissions, but everyone deserves the opportunity to see the other side of the world at least once in their life. Just try to be wise with it. Is it really worth going just for two weeks? When you get there must you plane-hop from country to country? Perhaps the best thing would be to consider one of the long-term placements such as those offered by Lattitude. They might send you to Ecuador to work in an ecotourism centre in the cloud forests for six months, or to Brazil for five months to help to build an eco-village. </p> <p>\"The most important thing,\" says Dr Simpson, \"is to ask questions, find out who you're travelling with and think it all through very carefully. Volunteering is a long and great tradition: for hundreds and thousands of young people, it's a brilliant experience. There are always going to be downsides: you just have to try to nudge it all in the right direction.\"</p> <h2>Useful websites</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.ethicalvolunteering.org\">ethicalvolunteering.org</a>; <a href=\"http://www.gapadvice.org\">gapadvice.org</a>; <a href=\"http://www.wwoof.org\">wwoof.org</a>; <a href=\"http://www.wwoof.org\">btcv.org.uk</a>; <a href=\"http://do-it.org\">do-it.org</a>; <a href=\"http://www.national trust.org.uk\">national trust.org.uk</a>; foe.co.uk (Friends of the Earth); <a href=\"http://www.planestupid.com\">planestupid.com</a>; <br><a href=\"http://www.risingtide.org.uk\">risingtide.org.uk</a>; <a href=\"http://www.climatecamp.org.uk\">climatecamp.org.uk</a>; <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk\">greenpeace.org.uk</a>; <a href=\"http://www.earthwatch.org\">earthwatch.org;</a> <a href=\"http://www.lattitude.org.uk\">lattitude.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Fears that the UK economy is heading into recession sent sterling tumbling against the dollar for the eleventh day in a row yesterday - its longest losing streak since the break-up of the Bretton Woods fixed exchange system in 1971.</p> <p>The pound fell to its lowest level against the US currency in almost two years on expectations that the Bank of England will be forced to cut the cost of borrowing to boost growth. A pick-up in US industrial production also helped a resurgent dollar and pushed down the price of oil and gold on global commodity markets.</p> <p>The pound closed at $1.85 on the foreign exchanges. It is down 6.5% since July, a move that will make it more expensive for British holidaymakers to visit the United States but will make UK exports cheaper to the world's biggest market.</p> <p>Michael Saunders at Citigroup said: \"Sterling remains vulnerable, especially against the US dollar. The pound averaged $1.55/\u00a3 over 1993-2002 and it would not be a surprise to see a return to those levels in the next 12-18 months.\" </p> <p>Tim Clayton, chief strategist at currency consultancy Investica, said: \"The US was the first economy to hit trouble. Now people are realising that the UK has the same problems, if not more so, as the US.\"</p> <p>Speculation about a cut in the cost of borrowing has intensified after the governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King delivered a bleak assessment of the British economy on Wednesday. The Bank has kept interest rates at 5% since April, as inflation has risen to 4.4% - more than double its 2% target - but Threadneedle Street believes growth in the economy will grind to a halt over the coming year. </p> <p>King said that there were \"bound\" to be one or two quarters of falling output as the UK felt the full force of rising commodity prices and the year-long credit crunch, with living standards under severe pressure. The Bank believed that the collapse in housing starts to a postwar low could reduce growth by between a quarter and half a percentage point.</p> <p>\"Increases in food and energy bills will intensify the squeeze on real take-home pay which, for many households, is unlikely to grow this year,\" King said at a press conference for the Bank's quarterly inflation report. \"These are circumstances in which consumer spending and house prices are likely to weaken together.\"</p> <p>Oil dropped to $112 a barrel yesterday, continuing its slide from a record of $147 a month ago. A rising dollar typically pushes oil lower as investors who buy crude and other commodities as hedges against inflation start dumping their positions to cut their losses.</p> <p>US crude fell $2.67 to $112.34 after dipping to $111.34 at one stage, the lowest price since May 2. London Brent lost $2.52 to $111.16. Speculation that the global economic slowdown will diminish demand, and that the Russia-Georgia conflict will not interrupt deliveries put crude under downward pressure yesterday.</p> <p>President Bush accused Russia on Friday of \"bullying\" Georgia, and European ally Germany criticised Moscow for going too far.</p> <p>Simon Wardell, oil analyst at Global Insight, said: \"We might get to $110 - how quickly we get there would depend on the demand outlook. If next week's US inventory data shows an increase in stocks, we could go lower.\" </p> <p>The price of metals, vegetable oil, corn, wheat and rubber also fell, while gold fell to $789 an ounce - its lowest since last December. Gold has fallen 23% from its record $1,032.70 an ounce on March 17 and silver has slumped 40% from its $21.3550 peak, hit on the same day.</p> <p>\"There's a fear that the whole commodity boom is going to end,\" said James Hughes, market analyst at financial traders CMC Markets. \"That's giving the dollar a bit of cheer.\"</p>",
  "<p>Days after Russia scored a stunning geopolitical victory in the Caucasus, President Abdullah G\u00fcl of Turkey said he saw a new multipolar world emerging from the wreckage of war.</p> <p>The conflict in Georgia, G\u00fcl asserted, showed that the United States could no longer shape global politics on its own, and should begin sharing power with other countries.</p> <p>\"I don't think you can control all the world from one centre,\" G\u00fcl told the Guardian. \"There are big nations. There are huge populations. There is unbelievable economic development in some parts of the world. So what we have to do is, instead of unilateral actions, act all together, make common decisions and have consultations with the world. A new world order, if I can say it, should emerge.\"</p> <p>G\u00fcl, relaxing in a hotel suite with a spectacular view of the glistening Bosphorus, spoke just hours before meeting with the visiting president of Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. </p> <p>He rejected the idea, promoted by the United States and Israel, that the best way to deal with Iran was to isolate, sanction and punish it. \"There are so many important issues, like the nuclear issue, Iraq, the Caucasus, Afghanistan,\" he said. \"Iran is definitely having some influence of these issues, so we are talking.\"</p> <p>G\u00fcl said Iran had a right to develop nuclear energy but not nuclear weapons. \"We don't want to see weapons of mass destruction in this region,\" he said. \"If it's in our neighbourhood, we definitely don't want to see it.\"</p> <p>Asked about the possibility of an American attack on Iran, G\u00fcl replied: \"I don't want to think about that. Everybody should take a lesson from what happened in Iraq,\" he said. \"Diplomatic solutions are always better than hard solutions.\"</p> <p>Few countries in the world have changed as dramatically as Turkey over the last decade, and G\u00fcl is among the most intriguing new political leaders to emerge here during that period.</p> <p>When first elected, he seemed to be part of a new Islamic wave that was challenging the entrenched secular elite. He is a practicing Muslim who married his wife when she was 15; she wears the headscarf that some secular Turks consider a badge of reactionary Islam. Yet he and his closest political ally, the prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, have led a political revolution that has brought Turkey closer to democracy than any regime in the modern state's 85-year history.</p> <p>G\u00fcl said Turkey could play a decisive role in bridging the chasm that separates the west from more turbulent regions. His country's effort to join the European Union, he said, was its \"main agenda\".</p> <p>\"I wish to see Turkey as an island where the European standard of democracy is being fulfilled and the free market economy is functioning very well,\" he said. \"This will be a real gift to the region, to the world, for peace. And this Turkey will be a source of inspiration for so many.</p> <p>\"As we are transforming ourselves in that direction, we will not forget our natural links and relationships and advantages with other countries - Muslim countries, central Asian countries, Caucasus countries, Middle Eastern and other countries,\" he added, speaking in fluent English. </p> <p>\"Turkey is having a positive impact on them, spreading the values of democracy, freedom, rule of law. Also, the economic changes here ... are admired. Maybe that is the indirect influence of this country.\"</p> <p>For much of this year, political life in Turkey was frozen as the constitutional court considered a prosecutor's charge that the ruling Justice and Development party should be banned because it was a \"focus of anti-secular activity\". Last month the court rejected that argument. </p> <p>Now, G\u00fcl said, Turkey's priority must be to resume its stalled progress towards political reform. \"In the last two years, we spent our energy on domestic issues, and the reforms slowed down,\" he said. \"Now, after the court case, there is a new era. This is a big opportunity for Turkey. Everybody realises that reforms are necessary.\"</p> <p>Some European leaders, G\u00fcl said, fail ed to recognise the contribution that Turkey was making to stability in the world's most volatile region.</p> <p>\"This is a big asset for Europe,\" he said. \"Turkey has great capacity to influence the region, indirectly, very peacefully, being an inspiration for changes. Turkey has been playing this role already. This has not been appreciated enough.\"</p> <p>Opposition to Turkish membership in the EU was for years based on the country's failure to meet democratic standards. More recently, politicians in some European countries have sought votes by bashing Turkey and pledging to keep it out of the EU regardless of its progress toward democracy. These campaigns, G\u00fcl said, harmed Europe's long-term interests.</p> <p>\"Europe should realise that Turkey can do more for the stability and security of the region,\" he said. \"Start with the Caucasus; last month, the problem was not serious, but suddenly we found ourselves in a war situation. </p> <p>\"Europe should encourage Turkey, and not create some artificial problems during the negotiation process with us. Some member countries or some politicians should not mix domestic issues and strategic issues. Domestic issues are conjunctural; today it's there and tomorrow it's not. But the strategic issues are always there, and we cannot sacrifice strategic issues for domestic issues. Unfortunately, nowadays we see this kind of shortsighted policies in some countries.\"</p> <p>G\u00fcl repeatedly returned to the importance of Turkey's democratisation process. He said it would ultimately resolve all of the country's domestic problems, including the long-festering conflict with Kurdish nationalists in south-eastern provinces. \"Some call it terror, some call it the south-east problem, some call it the Kurdish problem - whatever you call it, we will find a solution,\" he said.</p> <p>\"There are other problems - secularism and anti-secularism - those things will also find solutions in this climate. That is why I focus on the reform process. The problem was this: the lack of democracy, the standard of democracy. That was creating problems, not only in the south-east but in other issues. That is when we upgrade the standards, these problems will find solutions.\"</p> <p>With that, G\u00fcl was off to meet Ahmadinejad. \"Our values are different,\" he said with a smile, \"but having a good relationship helps the stability of the region.\"</p>",
  "<p>It was hailed as a heroic operation. Four Royal Marines strapped themselves to the sides of two Apache gunships to recover the body of a dead comrade. Dodging Taliban gunfire, the pilots landed allowing the marines to pick up the body of Lance Corporal Mathew Ford before taking it back across the Helmand river to their base.</p> <p>Yesterday, however, an official report on the circumstances leading to Ford's death revealed he had been killed by one of his own comrades in an operation carried out by poorly trained troops.</p> <p>A devastating board of inquiry report released by the Ministry of Defence exposed a catalogue of errors. The report revealed how a request for more troops by the commander of 3 Commando Brigade was turned down, and how communications became confused as troops struggled to cope with unfamiliar equipment.</p> <p>Amid the gun battle, a marine company commander, a major, was relieved of his post, the Guardian has learned.</p> <p>Ford died on January 15 last year during Operation Glacier, an assault on Jugroom Fort, a Taliban base in Garmser, in the south of Helmand province. The idea, says the board of inquiry, was to show that the Nato-led coalition was \"capable of operating anywhere it chose\". However, \"shortfalls in combat power\", identified by the brigade commander whose request to London for more troops was refused, prevented British forces from succeeding, specifically in being able to \"take and subsequently hold\" ground, the report says.</p> <p>Training was geared too much towards old-fashioned peacekeeping operations. The commando brigade \"was forced to adapt to a fast-moving operational environment quite different to that for which they had trained ... lessons were learned the hard way\", says the report. </p> <p>\"A lack of mutual understanding was exacerbated by the turnover of key staff,\" it adds.</p> <p>As Operation Glacier began, Z Company, from 45 Commando, gathered close to the fort. They attacked shortly after dawn, storming across the river in a convoy of Viking amphibious vehicles. Apache gunships and armoured vehicles. Troops made for the fort walls, jumped out of the armoured track vehicles, and started a ground assault. It was then that things started to go badly wrong.</p> <p>There was tension and strained relations between the commander and more junior officers in a new force structure \"facing a task for which it was not originally designed\". The problems were compounded by \"a great deal of confusion, exacerbated by the weight of fire from multiple locations\".</p> <p>Amid all this, a machine gunner on one of the Vikings opened fire. \"Thinking he had seen a muzzle flash [he] swung his weapon round almost 180 degrees and opened fire in the direction of the flash. Almost immediately the troops ... began shouting at him to stop firing towards the wall, as did his driver.\"</p> <p>The board of inquiry notes that the machine gunner's briefing \"had been hurried, that he was disorientated and that actions were spontaneous on witnessing what he believed to be enemy fire\".</p> <p>Four marines were evacuated. A head count revealed that the 30-year-old Ford was missing. An Apache pilot reported seeing a heat source by the wall of the fort. Ford was found with wounds to his head and chest.</p> <p>\"In hindsight, it is highly likely that L/Cpl Ford had already - instantaneously - died from his wounds,\" the report concludes. Both of his wounds, it adds, \"were very probably caused by Nato rounds\".</p> <p>His fellow marines and the Apache's army pilots agreed that the quickest and least risky way of getting him out was by strapping him to a helicopter. This, they achieved, as a US plane dropped three bombs to distract the enemy.</p> <p>The board of inquiry does not explicitly apportion blame and no disciplinary action has been taken. </p> <p>Major General Jerry Thomas, commander of 3 Commando Brigade at the time, said yesterday: \"If I did not think we were ready to deploy and if I did not believe in the ability of my people to conduct this operation successfully, I would not have allowed them to go. Although there was risk in mounting this offensive, the decision was made after a careful judgment, accepting that, while risk can be minimised, it can never be removed entirely. </p> <p>\"While the death of Lance Corporal Ford was a tragic incident, the courage and professionalism of those men that recovered his body was exemplary and in the best traditions of the UK's armed forces. </p> <p>Bob Ainsworth, the armed forces minister told the BBC: \"It is not the case that the brigade involved was under-prepared or under-resourced. There clearly were issues with the preparation of the operation, and the Royal Marines themselves will be looking at that soon.\"</p> <h2>Friendly fire</h2> <p>Sergeant <strong> Steven Roberts</strong>, 33, of the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment killed while manning roadblock near Basra, in 2003.</p> <p>Corporal <strong>Stephen Allbutt</strong>, 35, and trooper <strong>David Clarke</strong>, 19, of the Queen's Royal Lancers, were killed by British tank fire in 2003 near Basra. </p> <p>Lance corporal <strong>Matty Hull</strong>, 25, of the Blues and Royals, was killed after US A10 anti-tank aircraft attacked his convoy north of Basra in 2003. </p> <p>Private <strong>Andrew Cutts</strong>, 19, was shot in the head in Helmand province, Afghanistan, in 2006.</p> <p>Privates <strong>Aaron James McClure</strong>, 19, <strong>Robert Graham Foster</strong>, 19, and <strong>John Thrumble</strong>, 21, from the 1st Battalion of the Royal Anglican Regiment, killed in Afghanistan in 2007 by an American F15 bomber, called in to help during a fight with Taliban insurgents.</p>",
  "<p>A leading Blairite MP who is a close ally of David Miliband is being tipped for promotion to the cabinet in a move that indicates Gordon Brown wants to shore up his leadership by uniting the party after a series of electoral setbacks.</p> <p>Jim Murphy, the minister for Europe, impressed the prime minister with his handling of the Lisbon treaty during its bumpy passage through the Commons, and is being pencilled in as the next Scottish secretary.</p> <p>The promotion of a long-standing ally of Tony Blair would show that Brown wants to move on after Miliband prompted speculation about his leadership ambitions when he set out his vision for Britain in a Guardian article this month. </p> <p>Murphy, 40, has worked closely with Miliband after they were appointed to the Foreign Office by Brown after the resignation of Blair last year.</p> <p>Though Brown is understood to be in no rush to carry out his long-awaited reshuffle, he will hope that Murphy can be a safe pair of hands to calm nerves in Scotland after Labour's disastrous performance in the Glasgow East byelection. The MP for East Renfrewshire will be a fresh face for the party as it faces an uphill struggle to hold the normally safe seat of Glenrothes, which borders the prime minister's seat in Fife, in the forthcoming byelection.</p> <p>However, Murphy's promotion would prompt criticism that Brown made a mistake when he appointed Des Browne as both Scottish and defence secretaries last year. The decision opened him up to attack from the Tories and defence chiefs that fighting wars in Iraq and Afghanistan was seen as a part-time job. Browne is understood to have been lobbying to be relieved of one of his posts.</p> <p>Murphy could also take over responsibilities for Wales and Northern Ireland, as Brown finally carries out one of Blair's ambitions - to roll the \"nations\" into one job after the devolution of power from London. </p> <p>It is widely believed in Whitehall, however, that this cannot be done until the final stage of the Northern Ireland peace process has been reached, devolution of policing and criminal justice. Downing Street is determined to complete this by the end of the year, although the Democratic Unionists say this cannot be done until the IRA disbands its Army Council. This would allow Shaun Woodward, the Northern Ireland secretary, to be given a key job, possibly co-ordinating government policy.</p> <p>Brown will return to the fray next week when he visits Beijing for the Olympics closing ceremony. He is understood to be in no hurry to reshuffle his cabinet, but instead focus on \"substance\" issues, notably an economic plan to help less well off people cope with the downturn. Brown believes this is more important than the \"process\" issue of a cabinet reshuffle.</p> <p>Delaying it might complicate any challenge to Brown's authority in the run-up to the Labour conference. Sources suggest Brown has no intention of even considering standing down, and could use the reshuffle to remove people if they challenge him in private. Talk of an August bank holiday plot to persuade him to stand down seems to be fading. Dissidents, who are closely monitored by people close to Brown, seem undecided among themselves on what to do. Nobody wants to make the first move in case it backfires.</p> <p>Brown was impressed by Murphy's calm as he faced an assault in the Commons from the Tories, who insisted that the government had reneged on its word to hold a referendum on the EU constitution, an earlier version of the Lisbon treaty. Murphy was never likely to lose any of the votes, but Brown was struck by the way he dominated the argument by structuring the debates on bread and butter issues, the economy and the environment, rather than the dry areas beloved by fans and opponents of EU treaties.</p> <p>His promotion would also allow the prime minister to reprise a favourite joke: supporters of Blair, such as James Purnell and David Miliband, had to wait for Blair to resign before being given serious promotions.</p>",
  "<p>Finally allowed to leave Vienna after the Anschluss, Sigmund Freud was made to sign a document stating he had been treated well by the Nazis. He was unable to resist adding: \"I can most highly recommend the Gestapo to everyone.\" As Mark Edmundson points out, this sly aside shows how Freud devoted his life to the double - or multiple - meaning, while for the Nazis there was only \"one people, one nation, one leader and one meaning, the truth\". Freud and Hitler briefly co-existed in Vienna, but the links between them run deeper than geography; Edmundson shows how closely Freud's theories on leaders and followers anticipated the F\u00fchrer's rise. Freud may have come under attack in recent years, but at a time when the comfort offered by religious doctrine has dire global ramifications once again, Edmundson stresses the topicality of his ideas about \"the birth of the fundamentalist urge\". He describes the dying man, cigar crammed into his cancer-blasted jaw and mind ticking over, and compares his influence today: \"Against no little resistance, Sigmund Freud keeps going.\"</p>",
  "<p>Lightning forked again and again through the tropic night, flicking the perfect pair of volcanoes across the other side of the great dark lake on and off, in a scene that any special effects designer would have dismissed as impossibly de trop.

It is, after all, bedevilled with a reputation as the dark and sinister heart of Central America, beset by the ravages of a long civil war, and indelibly associated, travel-wise, with backpackers in packed buses driven by crazed and suicidal Lewis Hamilton wannabes.</p> <p>But you know about reputations. Besides, I have always been a sucker for the allure of Latin America, right from school days and that good-bad poem of WJ Turner, \"Chimborazo, Cotopaxi had stolen me away\". And then there is the not inconsequential matter of my two teenaged sons being born there, before we adopted them. There are those, I know, who object to international adoptions, arguing that help should be given there rather than here; I have never understood why it has to be either/or instead of both. This was their first trip back, an important charging of cultural batteries, and the cause of some understandable apprehension for all of us. I wish, though, that the doubters could have seen the reactions to our family, although they might have been embarrassed by my soppy tear-wellings of gratitude for the warmth.</p> <p>And now, since this is a travel piece, not a pulpit, I am going to be strong, get down and move on. We began the boys' heritage tour in Antigua, the colonial capital for more than 200 years before two earthquakes in the same year (1773) finally persuaded the Spanish that there might be a (relatively) safer site, the present buzzing, bustling capital, Guatemala City. </p> <p>Antigua, with its scores of stricken churches, monasteries and convents should be a musty museum piece, but the gusto of Guatemala and Guatemalans keeps getting in the way. In the old cathedral, for example, whose roof is long gone, a large column lies crazily crashed after the last big earthquake in 1976, just across from the unmarked grave of Pedro de Alvarado, Guatemala's ferocious conquistador; while up at the other end, in the north transept, two Antiguans were happily tinkering under a Toyota. </p> <p>A walk up the Calle dos Passos, or the \"Street of the Stations of the Cross\", each station posted by an impressive if often sundered baroque chapel, was also marked by enthusiastically courting couples. On a wall there was a notice advertising a lost dog, remarkable given that it's only 12 years since the country emerged from nearly four decades of a civil war between leftist guerrillas and the US-backed army which saw more than 200,000 people killed or disappear. There may still be gangs, drugs and poverty, but the energy of recovery and relief at ever-increasing normality is almost tangible.</p> <p>Half of the country's population of 13 million are of course Maya, descendants of those endlessly intriguing temple builders, astronomers and ritual sacrificers whose pomp came to a sudden and still not fully explained cession at the end of the ninth century. Tikal, one of their greatest cities, lies in the Peten, up in the north of Guatemala, 16 square kilometres, much of it still unexcavated, stepped temples that despite their limestoned immensity still contrive to loom suddenly above and through the swallowing jungle. Go, as we did, in July, in the rainy season, early in the day, and you will have this wonder largely to yourself, apart from the loudest cicadas I have ever heard, screeching macaws, howler monkeys hollering like lions, and, if you are of that turn, ghosts.</p> <p>The top of the Temple of the Masks, facing across Tikal's great central square to the equally mighty Temple of the Giant Jaguar, is not a bad place to muse on Mayan matters. The prediction, for instance, that 2012, the end of one of their immense and minutely calculated calendar cycles, will bring the end of the world. The dependence of such a sophisticated people on bloody sacrifices which accelerated alarmingly in the face of climate change and harvest loss. The panic sealed in stone by the just slightly out of kilter construction of Tikal's last temple. Or the Mayan Ball Game, a ritual game of keepy-uppy played with a three kilo rubber ball, first drop loses, losing captain also loses head, putting John Terry in Moscow into some perspective. And, too, the failure to develop the wheel, attributed by some to the lack of a large indigenous creature capable of pulling; by others to a belief in the sacredness of the great circle, the sun, not to be sullied by practical application. </p> <p>A large part of the journey from Antigua to Atitl\u00e1n was spent on that most romantic of roads, The Pan American Highway (I gauge we were about 10 days from Las Vegas). As we climbed up into the Guatemalan Highlands, a lush mixture of pine and pineapple, our guide, Oscar, pointed out numbers of army barracks that had been turned into schools. Musing here, however, was severely hampered by the aforesaid bus drivers, who were as driven as ever (it's about competition). </p> <p>We were overtaken at speed by an entire family on the move in what was clearly parts of two different vans welded together at a slight angle, causing the head of the family, driving through a splintered windscreen with fixed intensity, to slalom sideways downhill, through the rain. The back was packed with chairs, a wardrobe and the rest of their lives. We turned off to Atitl\u00e1n; I would have backed them to get all the way to Deadhorse, Alaska.</p> <p>Oscar, of mixed Spanish and Mayan blood, pointed out other mixtures, from Mayan arches supporting Spanish ones in Antigua, to the blending of the old and newer religions, which achieves its acme in Chichicastenango, the market town of the Quiche Maya.</p> <p>The colonial church of Santo Tomas, on the market square, sits on steps of an earlier temple: there are 18, the number of months in the ancient Mayan year. On them, shamans burn incense and say prayers to their God. Inside, there are low stone altars up the centre of the church, with candles. A sombre and murky Spanish oil painting of the crucifixion was splashed and stained with aguardiente, the Mayan alcoholic drink of choice and favoured offering. At the altar rails, a Mayan couple were praying; irreverent eavesdropping disclosed a Catholic prayer, in Spanish. That wry and seasoned traveller would doubtless say that Chichi has too many tourists now: it didn't feel like it.</p> <p>It does a touch more in Santiago Atitl\u00e1n, by the lake, under the volcanoes, where Catholicism manages to embrace a local saint called Maximon. Each year, during Easter week, an image of Maximon is placed in a little domed shrine outside the town's church (where a picture of that old doctrinal hardliner, Pope John Paul II, is prominently displayed) and then moved in solemn procession to the house of a different group of devotees. There Maximon sits in a chair, flanked by his impassive acolytes, when he's not in his bed upstairs, with his radio. He has a sombrero on his head, a cigar in his mouth, and likes to be offered strong drink, and money. This year's house also displayed a reclining Christ in a glass casket next to offerings of empty men's deodorant aerosols (English Lavender, we were proud to note). </p> <p>By now though, you will be wondering about the family element of the holiday, and that most fragile of things, the teenage attention span when exposed to culture, even if it is theirs. Well, the younger one scaled the Tikal temples as if claiming them, and has constructed his own miniature version, while his brother, taking a break from beguiling the always enthusiastic Guatemalans with his card tricks, applied that useful teenage word \"interesting\" to Tikal, and indeed the whole trip. Pressed beyond it, both of them talked about the energy, toughness and talents of Central Americans, past and present, said there was a lot to think about, whatever, and will be going back again, obviously. </p> <p>They also found travelling quickly in a harness hanging from a wire between platforms 50ft up in the jungle canopy at the entrance to Tikal, interesting. Their father would like to paraphrase Mrs Clinton: for all the pathetic, lily-livered middle-aged men who are worried by a wobbling step ladder: this one was for you. Consolation came from the man in the shop near Tikal who moved on from the ancient Mayan grasp of quantum physics to congratulate us on bringing our boys to their culture. More moistness.</p> <p>After Guatemala, we had two days relaxing across the border (which could be the model for an exotic border post theme park) in Belize at the Chaa Creek resort, a jungle lodge with canoeing, horse riding, swimming, spa, herbal medicine trail, and nocturnal flashlit treks to view jungle creatures of the night (snakes! scorpions! tarantulas!). </p> <p>Chaa Creek is run by Mick and Lucy Fleming, an Anglo-American couple who heard about it in a Belize City bar 30 years ago and have been developing it ever since, along with the help and company of a near-perfect setting, two children, more staff than they really need, six foster children and a determination to show that tourism can secure both environment and employment. They also have a river camp - shared shower block, hurricane lamps, that sort of thing - available at a lower rate than the lodge accommodation which we, naturally, wimped out of. (For those dismissive of such a cushy trip, I will merely mention the word \"suitcase\" and a sign in American Airlines' Guatemala City airport office which explains that the 10 most important words in Customer Services are, \"I apologise for our mistake. Let me make it right.\")</p> <p>But if your definition of a family holiday includes a cultural activity that grips all members equally, come back to Chichi and a dark, marginally candlelit room off the main body of the Calvario church, where our two boys sat enthralled, black olive eyes large, as Sebastian, small, 80, gold-toothed, deeply lined, but still black-haired, is talking to us about 2012. Sebastian, in the Mayan way both sacristan and shaman, told us in soft, slightly reedy Spanish that the end of one cycle leads to another rather than the end, and, just as calmly, predicted great disasters in the years leading to it, before the new age begins.</p> <p>Easier to mock here than there. Guatemala is a place where disaster is never far away. This seems to encourage time-seizing rather than resignation. And an excellent sense of humour. In the hushed gloom, I asked Sebastian, in my predictable, hackish way, the secret of his long life. He didn't hesitate: \"La cerveza,\" he said.</p> <h2>Way to go</h2> <p><strong>Getting there</strong> <br>Journey Latin America (020-8747 8315, 0161-832 1441, <a href=\"http://www.journeylatinamerica.co.uk\">journeylatinamerica.co.uk</a>) can organise a 12-day tailor-made holiday staying at the Villa Colonial in Antigua, Villa Santa Caterina on Lake Atitl\u00e1n, the Villa Maya near Tikal and The Lodge at Chaa Creek, San Ignacio, Belize for \u00a31,460 per adult and \u00a31,426 for a child (under 12) including Virgin Atlantic and American Airlines flights. </p> <p><strong>Further information</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.guatemalaweb.com\">guatemalaweb.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.travelbelize.org\">travelbelize.org</a>.<br>Country codes: Guatemala 00 501, Belize 00 502. <br>Flight time London-Miami: 9hrs; Miami-Guatemala City 2hrs 40mins. <br>Time difference: -7 hrs. <br>\u00a31=13.89 Guatemalan quetzals and 3.69 Belize dollars.</p>",
  "<p>In basketball terms, the story written this week by the Guardian's Madrid-based sports writer, Sid Lowe, looked like a slam dunk. Spain's Olympic basketball teams had posed for a pre-Olympics advertisement making \"slit-eyed\" gestures on a court decorated with a Chinese dragon. </p> <p>But now what was just a short item in the sports section of this newspaper has turned into a fully fledged international incident with claims that there could be an \"Anglo-Saxon\" conspiracy to derail Madrid's bid for the 2016 Olympics.</p> <p>The ad that started the international hoopla was for a courier company, Seur, the official sponsor of the Spanish basketball federation, and it occupied a full page in the sports daily Marca, the country's best-selling newspaper. Both the men's and women's squads posed in full Olympic kit and appeared to be pulling back the skin on either side of their eyes. </p> <p>\"No one involved in the advert appears to have considered it inappropriate nor contemplated the manner in which it could be interpreted in China and elsewhere,\" wrote Lowe. \"No offence was intended by the advert, but whether the Chinese see it that way is a different matter and it is likely to provoke more criticism at a delicate time for Spanish sport.\" </p> <p>He referred to the Spanish Olympic committee's desire to host the games in 2016 or 2020 and past incidents, including the monkey chants that greeted England's black footballers in a friendly game in Spain and the blacking up of some local fans when Lewis Hamilton was competing in the Spanish grand prix.</p> <p>What happened next could best be described in basketball jargon as an offensive rebound. The story was picked up on the internet, particularly in the US, where the picture caused some amazement and has since featured on everything from the popular satirical Daily Show to the national news networks. \"It is unfortunate that this type of imagery would rear its head at a time that is supposed to be about world unity,\" said George Wu of the Organisation of Chinese Americans.</p> <p>In Spain, the Guardian has been accused by some of the press of a national slur and there were dark hints in As, the Spanish sports daily, that this was part of a devious plot to derail Spain's Olympic bid. \"Members of the Madrid 2016 committee suspect that behind the Guardian's accusation exists a plan by certain people in the Anglo-Saxon world to dirty Spain's name over their bid for the games,\" it noted. </p> <p>As Lowe ruefully pointed out yesterday, the idea of a Madrid-based sports journalist not wanting the Olympics on his doorstep does not stand up to too much scrutiny. \"The backlash has been fairly fierce here,\" said Lowe, who has defended himself on Spanish television. \"It seems that no one read the original. I didn't accuse anyone of anything.\" </p> <p>The Spanish basketball federation has finally issued a statement to explain that the \"gesture was one of affection, friendliness and recognition\". They, too, suggested that the whole controversy had been generated \"in bad faith by some members of the press ... so we reserve the right to take appropriate legal action\".</p> <p>The Spanish players themselves have made it clear than no offence was intended. One of the squad, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Calder\u00f3n, who plays in the US with the NBA team the Toronto Raptors, said: \"We thought it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as affectionate. Nevertheless, some of the European media did not see it this way. </p> <p>\"I would like to say that we have a huge respect for the Orient and their people, some of my best friends in Toronto are from China and one of our Spanish national team sponsors is the Chinese brand, Li Ning.\"</p> <p>But another team member, Pau Gasol, who plays for the Los Angeles Lakers, added: \"Some of us didn't feel comfortable doing it. To me it was a little clownish on our part to be doing that. The sponsor insisted and insisted. They pushed because they're the people that pay the money. It was just a bad idea to do that. It was never intended to be offensive or racist against anybody.\" </p> <p>The team was booed by Chinese fans when they played and beat the host nation 85-75 on Tuesday, although it is unclear whether this had anything to do with the picture.</p> <p>The International Olympic Committee (IOC) have been anxious to defuse the row. \"Clearly, it was inappropriate,\" said Giselle Davies, an IOC spokesperson. \"But we understand the team apologised and the athletes meant no offence whatever. So, as far as we are concerned, the matter rests.\"</p> <p>Not that that has bothered the international blogosphere, where a furious cultural debate continues to rage over whether the players' gesture was harmless, affectionate and misunderstood or if the Spanish team had unwittingly accomplished what would constitute an unusual basketball manoeuvre: an own goal.</p> <p>The US basketball star Jason Kidd increased the pressure on the Spanish yesterday ahead of their meeting today, claiming: \"We would've been already thrown out of the Olympics.\" He told Yahoo Sports: \"At least, we wouldn't have been able to come back to the US ... there would be suspensions.\" </p> <p>And for his European peers, well, Kidd suggested: \"They won't do anything to them. It's a double standard.\"</p> <p>Some of the players in the Spanish picture compete in America's elite NBA, including the Lakers' Pau Gasol and Toronto's Jos\u00e9 Calder\u00f3n.</p>",
  "<p>Hurrah, it's Friday! Which means it's time for Davina to dip into her demented wardrobe, pull some random gurny faces and then kick someone out of the House of Charmless Horrors.</p> <p>I'll be liveblogging the Friday eviction show here from <strong>9-10pm</strong> on <strong>Channel 4</strong>, then <strong>back at 10.30</strong> for Davina's interview. Feel free to leave your comments below, and don't forget to click refresh for updates. Oh, and if you're just stopping by to express your withering disdain for our enjoyment of this show, can you not bother? It's just a bit of fun, and I'm sure you have better things to do, no? Ta. </p> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/organgrinder/2008/08/big_brother_9_the_eighth_evict.html\">Last week</a>, handsome fanny-nailer (ugh) <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/bigbrother/housemates/profile.jsp?housemateId=234\">Dale</a> got evicted over six-packed <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/bigbrother/housemates/profile.jsp?housemateId=470\">Stuart</a>, and was met in the studio by previous evictee Jen, who was no doubt clutching a 'we're worth more as a couple' magazine deal (cynical? me?). This week Stuart is back up for eviction against pretty Welsh girl <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/bigbrother/housemates/profile.jsp?housemateId=258\">Rachel</a>, which rather suggests that the remaining housemates have some kind of unspoken pact to remove all the good-looking people. Look, I don't know how to break this to you, but you're running out of options, frankly.</p> <p>So, what's been going on this week? Well, apart from performing their interpretation of <em>Die Fledermaus</em> and being attacked by winged monkeys (both of which I just made up, sorry), our tedious ten have been doing Olympian tasks (any excuse to put Stuart in Lycra) and extreme head shaving. There has also been cider stealing by Mo, more weird flirting between Sara and Darnell (gag) and much couply tension between Repellent Rex and his trashy girlfriend Nicole. Who full-on snogged Sara in the ashtray, ticking off the lipstick lesbian box on my Big Brother Clich\u00e9 Bingo card. Yawn.</p> <p>But back to Dale &amp; Jen (Den? Jale?) for a moment - whilst queuing in WHSmith for my lunchtime sandwich today (the lengths I go to to avoid being papped, seriously), I spotted no less than FIVE trash-mag Dale/Jen-related 'exclusives', including the mind-boggling <a href=\"http://www.ok.co.uk/magazine/\">'Our First Night Together' OK! cover story</a>. Has anyone read it? Was OK! actually IN the room? Is it quite literally a blow-by-blow account? Fair me put me off my tuna and cucumber, I tell you.</p> <p>Back at 9!</p> <p><strong>21:00:</strong> And....we're off. Davina is wearing a deeply inoffensive black dress, by the looks of it. What, no boiler suit/camel hoof combo? I am almost disappointed. Unflattering length though, and a highly dodgy alice band.</p> <p>Yesterday's update - most of the housemates are in the bedroom doing the shopping list. Lisa wants every possible variation on a cotton wool theme - pads, buds, the lot. Darnell and Mo are talking about Rex and Nicole - Darnell doesn't like Nicole, and thinks she will take Rex's shine away. Whatever that means.</p> <p>OH MY EYES!! Rex is wearing a green mankini Borat-style in the bathroom - he calls Nicole in to have a look and she is not amused. What must it be like to be entirely void of personality? FFS.</p> <p>Rachel is being profound and caring, and telling Mo not to change. He is not a bad person, she says, and doesn't deserve to be hated. He is a big part of this house, and people care about him, she says, like he is five. Mo doesn't care, and tells her so. Save your breath, love.</p> <p>In the garden, Sara admits that she would like to kiss Stuart? with her deeply irritating Aussie inflection. Mo repeats this through his loudhailer, adding on that she'd actually like 'to fuck him'. Nice.</p> <p>Ad break! Can I liveblog 'The Perfect Vagina' please? Looks like telly gold.</p> <p><strong>21:15:</strong> Davina is gurning and wittering on endlessly. Make it stop, please.</p> <p>Kathreya is wallowing in the bathtub and singing a slightly creepy song about 'Mr Swan'. I feel a hit coming on. Darnell is in the diary room; nominating Nicole has being weighing on his mind, because Rex is his mate and he thinks Rex might not like him any more if he knows Darnell nominated his girlfriend. It's an important question, which I think should be discussed at the highest level. Let's call Kofi Annan in.</p> <p>In the garden, Lisa is being attacked by killer bees. OK, she's not (more's the pity), but she is clearly an expert on this matter, having researched the potency of bee stings. Some wasp poison is equivalent to the rattlesnake, she says, or possibly a cobra. Please bear in mind that this is grown woman, rather than, say, a small child living in la-la land.</p> <p>Rex is discussing whether Nicole should be 'allowed' to wear high heels, as they make her too tall next to his diminutive form. Could he BE any more controlling? What a dick.</p> <p>There is some kind of squawky argument going on about whether you can or can't nominate people you do or don't like. I have stopped listening, and just realised what Lisa wants the cotton wool buds for. For sticking in her ears, and poking Rex in the eye.</p> <p>Ad break!</p> <p><strong>21:30:</strong> We're back! Rex and Nicole are in the bed, looking at his ring, which isn't nearly as interesting as it sounds. Kathreya and Mo are called to the diary room, and sent to jail for discussing nominations. Tsk.</p> <p>In the lounge, Lisa is saying that the house feels like home, and she has 'forgotten she's on a TV show'. Yes, but you think that BEES are as poisonous as rattlesnakes, so you're clearly talking out of your ginormous arse.</p> <p>Mo is in jail, and Vile Rex and his blonde personality vacuum have threatened to steal his cider when the shopping arrives. Mo has a crazed look in his eyes, like a man in jail with no cider. Rex is lying on the floor babbling on about how he is determined to take back the beer Mo took last night, and I have never more wanted to tread on someone's face.</p> <p>Is anyone really missing Brian and Samanda from last year? Yeah, me too.</p> <p>Beer, arguing, you don't fucking owe me fuck all blah blah whatever.</p> <p>Ad break! How DARE Nokia butcher Debussy in such a disgraceful fashion. I am appalled.</p> <p><strong>21:45:</strong> Mo is wearing a deeply disturbing gimp mask in prison. In the lounge, Lisa appears to have applied her lipliner in the dark. With a magic marker, whilst wearing oven gloves. Stuart is wearing a Dexys Midnight Runners neckerchief directly imported from 1983, and looks like a bloke I once snogged down the fairground.</p> <p>Rex takes Mo his cider in jail, who says thank you in a slightly humble fashion. Rex goes back in and tells everyone Mo didn't say thank you, because Rex is a TOTAL COCK. Ahem.</p> <p>Nicole sticks her nose in where it isn't wanted, asking Mikey why he's holding cookies (not a euphemism, blessedly) and Mikey goes off on one about her endless criticising, asking Rex if he agrees that his girlfriend is a giant pain in the ass. She has a very annoying voice, and I'm thinking Rex probably deserves her.</p> <p>Bohemian Rhapsody is being played into the house, and is systematically slaughtered by every housemate. Mamma Mia let me go.</p> <p>Rex and Nicole are in bed, and he is touching her head in a sinister fashion and demanding information about the outside world. She is not giving it up, clearly, and he is not happy that his girlfriend is not obeying his every command. Is anyone else reminded of the creepy guy from Sleeping With The Enemy?</p> <p>The lines are closed, the votes have been verified etc, and it's <strong>STUART!</strong></p> <p>There is crying. And hugging. He seems genuinely quite excited to be going. A centrespread in Men's Health calls. Oh, and his daughter, obv.</p> <p>Back at 10.35 for endless shots of Stuart's six pack! Hurrah! And Davina' perving, despite being old enough to be his mum (probably).</p> <p><strong>22:35:</strong> We're back! BACK! Davina looks somewhat excited at the prospect of being in close proximity to Stuart.</p> <p>We see the announcement again, and all the crying and hugging. Rex announces that he is 'disappointed' at the result, in front of Rachel. Nice.</p> <p>Stuart leaves, and I've just realised that the copious amounts of eyemakeup are merely there to detract from the fact that he's thinning on top. There is much cheering, and Stuart is dragged into the crowd by baying women off their heads on WKD (probably). Davina starts flapping, but the security men drag him out. The cheering turns to screaming. I believe Stuart may be popular with the ladies.</p> <p>Ad break! I want to know more about trimming one's labia, don't you?</p> <p>Stuart is safe in the studio, far from the feral crowd. He's got what he wanted, says Davina - he's been talking about leaving for weeks. Well why didn't you LEAVE, then? He's gone for the nail varnish as well as full eyemakeup, but doesn't have the hands for it, frankly. And also some kind of tie/scarf/noose thing. It's all a bit Rocky Horror. Frankly, he looks a bloody mess.</p> <p>We see who nominated him - Kathreya, Nicole, Darnell, Mo and Rex.</p> <p>Davina thinks he's lovely, and he gives her a kiss on the cheek. Down, girl.</p> <p>We see many, many shots of Stuart's over-buffed physique, and it's all deeply homoerotic - even my Other Half grudging concedes that he has an amazing body (a weird moment for me, frankly). Stuart is cringing, and says he hates it. Hmm, yet still he lifts weights in the pool, wearing speedos.</p> <p>Stuart talks about the other housemates, and comes over as being really quite cheeky and likeable, albeit a bit naive. He tries to be self-deprecating, but as Vina points out, he is clearly fishing for compliments, so perhaps not so naive. He wants Mikey to win, because he's the only one in the house who isn't acting, apparently.</p> <p>We see his best bits, which mainly involve him flirting with girls, having a laugh, getting stuck into the tasks, moaning about how much he misses his daughter and getting his body out.</p> <p>Can someone please explain to me how this guy is out, whilst Rex is still in? I am at a loss.</p> <p>And that's it! All over for another week. Not sure who's in the hot seat next week, but rest assured someone will be here. Thanks as ever for all your hilarious comments, and have a top weekend. Night! Hx.</p>",
  "<p>Few of the pioneers of the postwar pop music industry more effectively exploited the art of connoisseurship than Jerry Wexler, the American record producer and music industry executive, who has died of congestive heart failure aged 91. </p> <p>It was his good luck that along with two similarly endowed members of that small band, the Turkish brothers Ahmet and Nesuhi Ertegun, he developed the Atlantic label into a significant creative force in the fields of rhythm and blues, soul, jazz and rock. </p> <p>By supervising the recordings of Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, Joe Turner, Solomon Burke, Wilson Pickett, Dusty Springfield, Willie Nelson, Bob Dylan and many others during a studio career lasting almost 50 years, Wexler left a discreet but indelible mark on the popular culture of the second half of the 20th century.</p> <p>It was in 1947, as a young reporter with Billboard magazine, that he coined the term \"rhythm and blues\" to replace \"race records\" as the title of the weekly charts listing the best-selling 78rpm discs among America's black population. Having given it a name that became universally accepted, he helped define the genre after switching to record production. </p> <p>He had loved black music from childhood, developed a strong empathy with its exponents and knew how to encourage the finest expression of their art usually by the simple yet often overlooked expedient of setting their instincts free in a sympathetic environment.</p> <p>As influential as the individual recordings he supervised was his migration, in the mid-60s, from his New York base to a working environment below the Mason-Dixon line. First at the Stax and American studios in Memphis, then at Muscle Shoals in Alabama, and finally at Criteria in Miami, he popularised an ambience that put the emphasis on relaxation and a good groove, allowing a mixture of black and white musicians and singers to blend gospel, blues and country music with a minimum of extraneous decoration or polish. Wexler believed in an organic approach, and in his best recordings he made it sound like the only way to function.</p> <p>Location and environment became Wexler's secret: he took Pickett to Memphis, Franklin and Dylan to Muscle Shoals, Dire Straits to Nassau, and Mac Rebennack (better known as Dr John) back to his roots in New Orleans. By encouraging his artists to relax in the surroundings in which they made their records (when inspiration faded or energy flagged, he would take them fishing), he established a modus operandi that was eagerly copied by young white rock musicians. He was also meticulous in his choice of collaborators. After Ahmet Ertegun came the arranger Arif Mardin, the engineer Tom Dowd and the keyboard player Barry Beckett.</p> <p>Unlike most of their rivals in the somewhat primitive music business of the early 1950s, Wexler and the Erteguns were at ease with all levels of culture. Wexler's appetite for great literature, instilled by his mother who hoped he would become a writer, gave him an extensive knowledge of authors from Plato, Plutarch, Shakespeare, Dante, Moli\u00e8re, Tolstoy, Turgenev and Balzac to Havelock Ellis, Theodore Dreiser, Ring Lardner and John O'Hara. Their influence was blended with Harlem vernacular in the sometimes recondite <em>mots</em> justes that studded his conversation and the occasional album sleeve note. Describing an early Ray Charles recording, for example, he wrote: \"Losing Hand is a blues masterpiece, and the conversation between Ray's piano and Mickey Baker's guitar is now and always afterhours balm in excelsis.\"</p> <p>Born to a German Jewish father who struggled to make a living from a window-cleaning business and a doting Russian Jewish mother whose socialist inclinations led her to sell the Daily Worker on the streets of Harlem, he was brought up in the Washington Heights district of Manhattan. There he spent more of his early life in a notorious pool hall than at school. At night he would steal off with his friends to hear the big bands of Fletcher Henderson or Jimmie Lunceford at the Savoy ballroom. \"I loved the Harlem of the 30s,\" he wrote in his autobiography, \"loved its look and feel, its dance halls and nightclubs and especially its sounds.\" He was already combing junk shops for discarded 78s by Louis Armstrong, Coleman Hawkins or Fats Waller. Down in Washington DC, where their father was the Turkish ambassador, the Erteguns were doing the same.</p> <p>Eventually Elsa Wexler secured her son a place to study journalism at Kansas State College of Agriculture and Applied Science (now Kansas State University) in Manhattan, Kansas, but he lasted only two of the scheduled three years before returning home, where attempts at various careers \u2014 delivery boy, liquor store clerk, waiter \u2014 foundered until he began working for his father, \"the only employer who woudn't turn me down\". Washing the windows of office blocks and brownstone houses was an ordeal alleviated by jazz and blues, the films of Jean Renoir and Marcel Carn\u00e9, at the Museum of Modern Art, and a meeting with Shirley Kampf, who would become the first of his three wives (the others were Renee Pappas and Jean Arnold) and the mother of his three children.</p> <p>Their wedding delayed his call-up by a year, and he worked as a customs officer. In 1942 he was drafted into the army, where he took a psychology course and gave personality tests to trainee pilots, bombardiers and navigators in the Army Air Corps. After demobilisation, he went back to Kansas in 1946 to complete his degree, and the following year secured a job at Billboard, one of the two major trade papers serving the music industry. For the next four years he deepened his knowledge and developing a range of contacts in a community that quickly recognised his energy and perception.</p> <p>A brief interlude in music publishing was followed in 1953 by Ahmet Ertegun's invitation to become a partner in the fledgling Atlantic concern, an investment of $2,000 securing him a salary of $300 a week and a 13% stake, rising to 30% as other shareholders departed. Ertegun spent the stake money on a green Cadillac which became Wexler's company car.</p> <p>Immediately he was thrown into an environment where doing whatever was necessary to keep an influential disc jockey such as Alan Freed playing Atlantic's records alternated with supervising sessions that produced such classics as the Drifters' Money Honey (with a lead vocal by the superlative Clyde McPhatter), Big Joe Turner's original version of Shake, Rattle and Roll and LaVern Baker's Tweedlee Dee. Within months Wexler and Ertegun were also involved with a 23-year-old singer and pianist from Florida named Ray Charles, with whom they would lay the foundations of soul music.</p> <p>\"I realised that the best thing I could do with Ray was leave him alone,\" Wexler wrote 40 years later, although Charles's own memory of their early collaborations was somewhat different, and involved the singer responding to the producer's stream of musical suggestions with a caustic ultimatum. \"If I'm gonna do a session,\" Charles told Wexler, \"I'm gonna do it my way, or I ain't gonna do it at all.\" Wexler was shrewd enough to step back and allow Charles's extraordinary talent to express itself in a stream of hits that included It Should Have Been Me, This Little Girl of Mine, Lonely Avenue, and the two records in which Charles created the formula for the fusion of gospel and R&amp;B that became soul music: I Got a Woman and What'd I Say.</p> <p>By the time Charles left Atlantic, in 1959, the company was well established. \"I dig cross-cultural collaborations and craved success,\" Wexler wrote, \"which is maybe why Ahmet and I got on so well.\" He went on to produce Solomon Burke, another fine singer adept at bringing gospel fervour to the cadences of a blues or a country song, resulting in a string of hits that included Goodnight Baby, Everybody Needs Somebody to Love and a magnificent version of Jim Reeves's country ballad He'll Have to Go.</p> <p>It was his recordings with Pickett, including In the Midnight Hour and 634-5789, that immersed Wexler in the specialmusical culture of Memphis, where he negotiated Atlantic's distribution deal with the Stax label, thereby ensuring his company's participation in the profits from hits by Otis Redding, Sam and Dave, Rufus and Carla Thomas, and Booker T and the MGs.</p> <p>Aretha Franklin, however, was his greatest success, even though the Muscle Shoals session that produced her first Atlantic single, I Never Loved a Man, featured a near-catastrophic row between the session musicians and Franklin's volatile husband and manager, Ted White. As soon as the record was released, however, it became apparent that Wexler, Dowd and Mardin had succeeded where other labels had failed in capturing the essence of the singer's artistry. Her hits with Wexler would include Respect, Chain of Fools, I Say a Little Prayer and many others. </p> <p>Two decades of producing classic R&amp;B and soul records had made Atlantic a legend to young British rock musicians, and towards the end of the 1960s Ahmet Ertegun was able to add the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin to the label's roster, their recordings boosting the company's profits at a time when it was being taken over by Warner-Seven Arts. Eventually Wexler and his old partner went their separate ways, Ertegun retaining his stature as the label's public face while Wexler relocated to Florida and eventually left the company altogether.</p> <p>His taste, experience and gifts as a raconteur made him a magnet for a younger generation, meaning there was no shortage of work as an independent producer, including Dusty Springfield's Dusty in Memphis (with its hit single, Son of a Preacher Man), Cher's 3614 Jackson Highway, Willie Nelson's Phases and Stages, Etta James's Deep in the Night and The Right Time, Dire Straits' Communiqu\u00e9, Carlos Santana's Havana Moon, and the two albums with which Bob Dylan celebrated his conversion to Christianity, Slow Train Coming and Saved. By the time he stepped down from the front line in the 1990s, just about the only significant name missing from Wexler's CV was that of Elvis Presley, whom he had narrowly failed to capture for Atlantic in 1956 and whose subsequent recordings, it is fair to say, he would have improved immeasurably.</p> <p>His survived by his wife Jean, and his son Paul and daughter, Lisa . His daughter Anita, predeceased him. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Gerald \"Jerry\" Wexler, record producer and music industry executive, born January 10 1917; died August 15 2008</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Monday August 18 2008.

  "<p><br> Piazza Grande ... the audience during the screening of Berlin Calling. Photo: Fotofestival/Ti-Press/F. Agosta</p> <p>Locarno is the proverbial sleepy hamlet, with a population of some 15,000 tucked into a valley along the shores of Lake Maggiore, at the foot of the Swiss Alps. But every night for 11 days in August, a good half that number throng the town's central Piazza Grande and gape at the sights imported onto a massive outdoor movie canvas. Down the road the Fevi expo hall hosts another couple of thousand punters, and there are simultaneous screenings at five other sites.</p> <p>Locarno's international film festival doesn't fetch the stars or elite auteurs of A-list festivals like Cannes, Venice and Berlin, but it's nothing if not eclectic. The night I stumbled in, the piazza was all sturm und drang with Philipp St\u00f6lzl's Nordwand (North Face), an Alpine-conquest saga based on an actual Nazi-era tragedy.</p> <p>Festival first-nighters would have encountered the perhaps more exotic spectacle of Evelyn Waugh's Oxford aristos in the new big-screen condensation of Brideshead Revisited; and I left shortly before the second coming of James Caviezel (Mel Gibson's Christ) as an extra-terrestrial Viking saviour doing battle with a fellow-travelling space monster in Howard McCain's Outlander. </p> <p>Garth Jennings' pint-sized Stallones got the screen of their dreams as Son of Rambow continued its meandering global rollout, and the piazza also hosted several repertory tributes. Egypt's late Youssef Chahine was saluted with a screening of his exuberant call-to-tolerance Destiny; blacklistee Jules Dassin's London noir Night and the City turned up in a tribute to the Royal Belgian Film Archives; and Italy's Nanni Moretti, the subject of a sweeping festival retrospective, was given the outdoor treatment as a water polo-playing Communist politician with amnesia in his 1989 Palombella Rossa.</p> <p>I caught Choke, another adaptation of a novel by Chuck Palahniuk, the author of Fight Club. It was suitably off the wall: Sam Rockwell brought his mild derangement to bear as Victor Mancini, a self-loathing sex addict raised by a fugitive hippie mother (Anjelica Huston) who's now la-la in a mental home. To pay her bills, he works in a colonial-history theme park by day, and by night redeems the rich by choking on his food in front of them in restaurants. \"Somebody saves your life, they'll love you forever,\" he counsels.</p> <p>Victor reckons he'll find redemption in the identification of his unknown father, especially when his mum (mistaking Victor for her lawyer) confesses that his father was not, after all, a travelling salesman from Norway with Tourette's. Instead a new doctor at the hospital (Kelly MacDonald), translating mum's Roman diaries, reveals that Victor owes his paternity and blessed abilities to a fragment of sacred foreskin.</p> <p>Confused yet? The film (directed by actor Clark Gregg) didn't have the skills or derring-do of David Fincher's Fight Club, but it was amiably shambolic, oddly soft-centred - and certainly kinder to its satyric protagonist than Anne Fontaine's supposedly comic La Fille de Monaco was to its titular nympho.</p> <p>Julian Temple's The Eternity Man, an adaptation of Jonathan Mills' opera about Arthur Stace, the prolific religious graffitist of Sydney, was also a lot more fun early on, while it dealt in sin rather than salvation.</p> <p>But I must confess to a hollow feeling for having missed the advent of Nanni Moretti to the festival with a specially devised film quiz. First prize was 11 days in a luxury hotel in Vienna, with a guided visit to the best cake shops in the capital.</p>",
  "<p>More than 400,000 holidaymakers face severe disruption at the end of the month after staff voted to go on strike at Britain's two busiest airports for charter airlines and low-budget carriers. </p> <p>Union leaders warned that industrial action at Gatwick and Stansted could spread across the UK with workers at Manchester, Birmingham and Newcastle airports also holding walk-out ballots. </p> <p>Baggage handlers and check-in staff at Gatwick and Stansted will stage 24-hour strikes on bank holiday Monday on August 25, and August 29, after rejecting a 3% pay rise offer. </p> <p>The strike by workers at airport services firm Swissport will affect services by Gatwick-based airlines including Virgin Atlantic, Thomsonfly, Monarch and First Choice and flights operated by Ryanair and easyJet at Stansted, where they are the biggest customers.</p> <p>The Unite union said all airlines using Swissport's services would be grounded. \"The flights could not operate. If these strikes go ahead it would effectively shut down the airlines' operations,\" said Steve Turner, Unite's national secretary for aviation.</p> <p>Swissport and airport owner BAA were holding talks with airline bosses last night to gauge whether they could keep flights running with a skeleton workforce. Swissport said it hoped to \"minimise disruption to the travelling public\" while one airline, Virgin Atlantic, said it had contingency plans in place and expected \"business as usual\" for its Gatwick flights. </p> <p>Ryanair said it would operate hand-luggage-only flights if the strikes went ahead. Services to Las Vegas, Lanzarote and Malaga would be among the flights affected on August 25 and 29. Industry experts warned that passengers should at least expect delays, if not cancellations, if last-ditch negotiations fail.</p> <p>\"The airlines and Swissport will attempt to draft in management and where possible use non-unionised workers. There will be a risk of delays and this is worst time of year for it to happen, at the peak of the summer season when flights are their fullest,\" said John Strickland, an airline consultant. Swissport said it intended to continue talks with the Unite and GMB unions over averting the strikes. </p> <p>BAA's much-maligned airports have had an uneventful summer but their vulnerability to operational mishaps was underlined on Thursday when thousands of passengers at Heathrow's Terminal 3 had to fly off without their bags after a computer glitch shut down the baggage handling system. </p> <p>BAA said 3,500 bags were separated from their owners following the software breakdown, which also saw 4,500 passengers ordered to queue up outside the terminal after check-in desks were closed. The airport group said airlines had begun reuniting passengers with their bags.</p> <p>Gatwick and Stansted are the UK's second and third largest airports and will handle a total of more than 200,000 passengers a day over the bank holiday weekend. Holidaymakers will be most affected because both airports are popular with charter and low-budget carriers. </p> <p>Unite described the 3% pay offer as an \"insult\" and has demanded a pay rise of 5% for its members, in the latest pay dispute to focus on the rising rate of inflation. </p> <p>\"Our members are already struggling to keep up with rising food and energy costs. This pay offer is an insult to professional, hard-working men and women who have to operate in extremely difficult conditions. Our members have had enough,\" said Unite's Turner. </p> <p>A Ryanair spokesman said: \"This strike is totally unjustified. Union chiefs should be grateful that they are getting any increase at all at a challenging time for the global economy.\"</p> <p>Baggage screeners at Stansted have also voted to go on strike, but the airport said services would not be affected. BAA is braced for another blow to its business next week, when the Competition Commission is expected to demand the sale of Gatwick and one of its Scottish airports. </p> <p>The competition watchdog has already indicated that BAA's monopoly over airports in south-east England is bad for airlines and passengers because it encourages the group to hold back plans for new runways and underinvest in services.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/business/merrilllynch\">Merrill Lynch</a> could avoid paying tax in the UK for decades after booking \u00a313bn of losses on its toxic investments through its London subsidiary.</p> <p>The impact on the Treasury's coffers is the latest illustration of the impact the credit crunch is having on the wider economy and has led to concerns about the reduction in tax receipts on the government's fragile finances.</p> <p>Banks are a crucial contributor to the public's finances. National Audit Office data for the 2005/2006 financial year - the most recent available - shows that banks were the biggest payers of corporation tax at \u00a37bn. This is the payment from all large banks, and includes the high street banks as well as the London operations of Wall Street firms now hit hard by the credit crunch.</p> <p>The impact of the downturn in the profitability in the banking sector on tax receipts may become apparent in the pre-budget report this autumn when the Treasury makes its estimates for the public finances.</p> <p>Bill Dodwell, head of tax policy at accountants Deliotte, said: \"The good news is they have been collecting more corporation tax from the oil sector but who knows if that is going to compensate for the losses by the banks\".</p> <p>In the first half of the year, the profits of the high street banks listed in London are down \u00a314bn on the same period in 2007 which will have an impact on their tax bill which is set at the end of the financial year. For the first six months of last year the banks expected to pay taxes of more than \u00a35bn, but their latest set of figures indicate they now expect to pay \u00a31bn. </p> <p>Under UK law, losses can be carried forward indefinitely until the company has made as much in profit again as it has losses. According to accounts filed at Companies House earlier this month, Merrill Lynch made \u00a37.4bn of losses in the year to end-December compared with a profit of \u00a3393m the previous year. </p> <p>After the financial year end, the accounts show the firm recorded exceptional writedowns of \u00a35.5bn related to investments that have turned toxic in the credit crunch, taking the total loss to almost \u00a313bn. Merrill could yet record further losses on the collaterialised debt obligations - complex instruments at the core of its losses - which will also be booked through London.</p> <p>Merrill Lynch today took steps to attempt to return to profitability by announcing a hiring freeze. In a memo from New York head office signed by Gregory Fleming, president and chief operating officer, and Thomas Sanzone, chief administrative officer, the bank said that only financial advisors were immune from the ruling on headcount.</p> <p>The pair wrote: \"A global hiring freeze will be in place for the remainder of the year. This freeze covers any incremental hires including previously approved budgeted hires and replacement hires. This policy does not apply to financial advisors or client associates who the firm will continue to recruit and hire in line with business plans.</p> <p>\"Typically, the majority of the firm's hiring occurs during the first and second quarters of the year with the third and fourth quarters progressively tapering off,\" the memo said.</p>",

So far as I know, no British paper reported the typhoon at all, since the victims were all Vietnamese in untouristed parts of the country (on the beach they just grumbled that it was raining a lot) and if I felt anything when I heard the news of all those deaths it was a faint pleasure or gratitude, or at least approval that it was they who died and not anyone I love.</p> <p>I don't think this is blameworthy, any more than I would blame a Vietnamese peasant who rejoices when my son, not his, is drowned in the next typhoon. To have different degrees of affection and different priorities is natural and in a Darwinian world inescapable. We love our own children most because we are descended from creatures who did \u2013 and who behaved as if they loved them long before they could feel emotions, still less talk about them. Those who were indifferent whether their own or others' children survived left no descendants.</p> <p>That's why I find extraordinary the view among some Cif commentators that religion is to blame for human selfishness and groupthink. So far as I know, chimpanzees practice no religion, yet they have no qualms about exterminating weaker bands.</p> <p>One of the atheist commentators here, Kimpatsu, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/12/religion.usa?commentid=0751d864-db82-41c6-b374-998f401aa0b0\">quoted a Nobel prize winner,</a> Mohammed el Baradei, as saying in his acceptance speech: \"I shall not rest until all of us feel as much pain at the death of an unnamed child in Africa as we would for the death of our own son or daughter.\" All I can say is that El Baradei is going to die a very tired and disappointed man.</p> <p>Perhaps we should all care more about the deaths of unknown children everywhere; certainly we should do more to prevent them, even without caring any more. I'd be much more grateful to the politician who works out how to convert lukewarm feeling more effectively into action than one who relies on whipping up feeling on everything that matters. But it's perfectly grotesque to suggest that we should feel as much for the sufferings of un-named and unknown children as we would for our own.</p> <p>Perhaps, at this point Guardian readers are feeling a tepid wash of liberal guilt: even though we know that we don't in fact feel anything like the same sentiment for other people's distant children as we do for our own, surely we ought to acknowledge that we ought to feel more than we do? This, too is wrong. We oughtn't at all to feel more for unknown African orphans. In proof of this, consider the halfway case, of Madeleine McCann. Here is a child whom we don't know, and will never know, but whose name is extremely familiar because lots of people get a kind of pleasure out of the story, and so demand more of it. The faint mixed feelings so pleasurably aroused in millions of consumers by the tabloid press and the television news have done no one any good at all. They have helped make the McCann's life an even greater misery. They have done nothing whatever to diminish the chance of other children being kidnapped.</p> <p>If that is the effect of sentiment on a child whose face we know, and to whom we are able to attach a nickname (even if it is one the family never used), how much more fatuous is it to pretend to feel anguished about the fate of people whose existence we know nothing about? By all means help them, but let's not pretend to anguish as we do so. To try to relieve global poverty should be a duty about as pleasurable as paying taxes, not an occasion for self-congratulation on our exquisite sensibilities.</p>",
  "<h2>Uganda</h2> <p>A programme of mass circumcision to <strong><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/6h5l7u\">prevent the spread of HIV and Aids</a></strong> has been announced by the Ugandan government. It is responding to the results of recent studies that indicate that the procedure provides up to 70% protection from the deadly infection, if other safe sex practices such as condoms are also used. Taking advantage of what some tribal groups already call \"circumcision season\", the state hopes to encourage 3,000 young men aged 12-18 to go under the knife in the coming weeks.</p> <p>Aids activists have shown support and called for a similar approach to be adopted on a global scale, but critics argue that men may engage in more risky sexual behaviour if they think circumcision makes them immune. There are also concerns that HIV and other conditions could be further spread \u2013 in the past, scalpels have been re-used unsterilised, but the government has introduced a strict \"one knife per operation\" policy.</p> <p>* Also in the fight against Aids, Oxfam is calling on governments and international aid agencies to include <strong><a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org/en/policy/bp115-female-condom-0808\">the female condom</a></strong> in their disease prevention programmes: a recent report indicated that they are an effective yet much neglected form of protection.</p> <p>Women make up 75% of new HIV infection cases in sub-Saharan Africa but have often had little control over barrier contraception. Oxfam spokesperson Farah Kamiri said : \"The female condom is the only method that women have to protect themselves. It has been embraced in many countries and cultures, it works and it is cost-effective. Political leadership and funding are needed now. No more excuses.\"</p> <p>* Meanwhile, the New Vision reports that the first <strong><a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/200808130095.html\">Ugandan-made anti-retroviral drugs</a></strong> are now on sale in the country. Pharmaceutical company Quality Chemical Industries is producing 60 million tablets per day in the first African factory to produce the drugs.</p> <p>Although they have not yet been granted a licence by the World Health Organisation, which have visited the factory, the drugs have been endorsed by the Ugandan National Drug Authority.</p> <p>* Elsewhere in Uganda, the Ministry of Education has received a large injection of cash from the African Development Bank to <strong><a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/200808140148.html\">refurbish government-aided secondary schools</a></strong>, the New Vision reports.</p> <p>$70million has been donated to equip laboratories and libraries, to renovate classrooms and dormitories, to expand 15 secondary schools and to build 12 more. The schools, selected from all over the country, have not been refurbished for more than 30 years and have been struggling to cope with the number of students.</p> <h2>Kenya</h2> <p>Hopeful news is emerging from Kenya, where the Ministry for Energy claims to have found a way to <strong><a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/200808130867.html\">increase production of bio-fuels without causing greater food shortages</a></strong>.</p> <p>The <strong><a href=\"http://www.irinnews.org\">United Nations humanitarian news department, IRIN</a></strong> reports on a five year strategy to cultivate the poisonous jatropha curcas shrub and process its seeds to produce bio-diesel for transport and power generation. If all goes according to plan, the Ministry foresees significant drops in the country's diesel imports and domestic use of kerosene over the next five years. Other benefits will include an increase in forest cover and a reduction in environmental degradation.</p> <p>The plan states that Kenyans will be able to, \"enjoy and derive comfort from the supply of bio-diesel for agricultural production, employment creation, rural-urban balance and blending in the motor vehicle industry.\"</p> <h2>Eastern European aid to Africa</h2> <p>Africa will benefit from increased support from Eastern Europe as a growing number of countries sign up to the European Union and its aid regulations. The end of the Cold War saw a redirection of resources away from Africa as aid money was focused on Eastern European countries instead, <strong><a href=\"http://www.afrol.com/features/25604\">Afrol News reports</a></strong>, but this trend is now slowly being reversed.</p> <p>The UN recommends that 0.7% of developed states' GDP be used for aid. Although the EU stipulations are lower (0.39% is the long-term goal), they require countries applying for membership to outline their international development aid policy and plans for setting up aid agencies.</p> <p>As former Communist countries have benefited from EU economic help, so their wealth has grown. Of the new EU members, Poland has most developed its donation policies and is about to meet the EU spending targets \u2013 Angola has been the main beneficiary.</p> <p>The spending on the continent will continue to increase in future as the EU aims to double aid by 2010, and triple it by 2015.</p>",
  "<p>The repossession crisis could get as bad as it was in the early 1990s, the Liberal Democrats claimed today.</p> <p>Vincent Cable, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, said that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/aug/15/repossessions.property\">today's figures showing a 24% rise in the number of repossession orders</a> was \"very worrying\".</p> <p>\"The level of growth of repossession orders suggests that we are on track for a repossession crisis very similar to the early 1990s,\" Cable said.</p> <p>\"It is absolutely vital that the government should intervene and require a proper code of conduct to be implemented by mortgage lenders. </p> <p>\"This should not just apply to the big banks but to the large number of secondary lenders who are using court action to pursue their debts in a very aggressive way. </p> <p>\"The Council for Mortgage Lenders' code of conduct should be put on a statutory footing for all repossession actions.\"</p> <p>Today's figures show that there were 28,658 repossession orders against borrowers in the second quarter of 2008.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/aug/15/advertising.marketingandpr\">Stella Artois and ad agency Lowe have bid adieu after 26 years</a>, bringing an end to one of the most famous relationships in UK advertising history.</p> <p>Stella's famous \"Reassuringly expensive\" ads have charmed TV audiences but in recent years have made for a tricky juxtaposition as the brewer has struggled against a street-level view of its premium brand as \"wife beater\".</p> <p>Sir Frank Lowe, the eponymous founder of the agency who left in 2005, hit brand gold with his founding client when he launched the \"Reassuringly expensive\" positioning in the early 1980s.</p> <p>There is no question of the pedigree of the ads, which are mostly French-themed, cinematic, often shot in black and white and always epic.</p> <p>The first of the famous ads featured \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuYVq8M7ybs\">Jacques\" the flower seller</a> in the in the Jean de Florette-inspired series of commercials.</p> <p>A string of often award-winning ads followed over the years including <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msFh08ZsE48\">\"Returning Hero\"</a>, which saw a bar owner cunningly stand on a beer hose to save giving \"precious\" Stella to two war veterans; and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01mG3RDdf28\">\"Pilot\"</a> featuring a bartender giving up a downed pilot to the Germans.</p> <p>There was also <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esgT1dpGOZo\">\"Last Wishes\"</a>, the one with the man who gets a pint of Stella for a man on his deathbed after the villagers have had a whipround. On the way back from the bar, he drinks the pint but convinces the villagers that the priest has drunk the beer by tking the cleric's coat and passing him the empty pint glass.</p> <p>Hellboy actor Ron Perlman made an appearance in 2003's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OKw3_XTvro\">\"Devil's Island\"</a> and Jonathan Glazer's witty <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qq0pdtEtrig\">\"Ice Skating Priests\"</a> have appeared in more recent TV campaigns.</p> <p>The ads draw on images from another place and time, of quality and reserve. Gentleness even.</p> <p>Problem is, back in the real world Stella Artois has found itself on increasingly tricky ground as health campaigners have targeted the brand for its alleged role in binge drinking culture.</p> <p>Stella Artois this year pulled its sponsorship of the pre-Wimbledon tennis tournament at Queen's Club, which Lowe created as a marketing vehicle 30 years ago. Some argue this was because of the increasingly contentious issue of linking the brand with sport.</p> <p>The writing was on the wall for Lowe when Stella's parent company InBev, which has rattled the marketing department changes since the merger of Interbrew and Ambev in 2004, handed part of the brand's ad account to rival agency Mother - a hot front runner to take the whole business, surely.</p> <p>Still, the account defined Lowe and its loss, which comes after a string of managerial shakeups in recent years, will undoubtedly sting the agency and its ambitions as a global network.</p> <p>Stella spends around \u00a313.5m a year on above-the-line advertising in the UK alone, according to Nielsen Media Research.</p> <p>Perhaps the biggest question as Stella charts new horizons is what creative approach the brand needs to take to tackle its \"wife beater\" image.</p>",
  "<p>At last, a conservation success story. This week the world welcomed news that humpback whales have made a remarkable recovery, following four decades of protection from commercial whaling. But is this really a turning of the tide in the battle to save the world's magnificent whales from extinction?</p> <p>The Guardian reported earlier this week that the population of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/12/conservation.wildlife\">adult humpbacks</a> is now estimated to be around 40,000, prompting the <a href=\"http://www.iucn.org\">International Union for the Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) to reclassify the humpback whale from \"vulnerable\" to \"of least concern\" in its \"red list\" of endangered species.</p> <p>But could this new-found status be of dubious benefit \u2013 allowing Japan and other whaling nations to argue it is time once again to turn their harpoons on this species?</p> <p>The threat is real: just last year Japan threatened to kill 50 humpbacks (in addition to over 900 minke whales and 50 endangered fin whales) in the Southern Ocean sanctuary in the waters around Antarctica \u2013 defying both the global moratorium on commercial whaling and the existence of an internationally recognised whale sanctuary. </p> <p>This announcement caused huge outcry as people around the world condemned plans to kill humpbacks \u2013 icons of the conservation movement. Famed for their haunting songs and highly visible, energetic leaping displays, they have become one of the mainstays of the fast-growing whale-watching industry.</p> <p>Following global condemnation, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/dec/22/japan.endangeredspecies\">Japan didn't follow through</a> with its threats to slaughter humpbacks last year, although other threatened species were still pursued and hunted down, dying painfully at the end of an explosive harpoon. Whaling is inherently cruel, with many animals taking up to half an hour to die.</p> <p>In addition to hunting the fin whale, Japan also regularly kills endangered sei whales. Iceland has also <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/sep/04/conservation\">hunted fin whales</a> as recently as 2006 and is currently attempting to defy the ban on international trade in whale products. Historically targeted in huge numbers by the world's whaling industry, both species are still at very low levels compared to their pre-whaling era abundance. </p> <p>The red list should serve as a reminder of the challenges facing all the whale species still struggling to recover from more than three centuries of commercial whaling. The largest animal ever to have lived, the blue whale, is still so rare that it remains on the list as \"critically endangered\", the highest category of threat.</p> <p>Today, our planet's great whales face more threats than at any time in history. In addition to commercial whaling, which is cruel and unnecessary, whales and dolphins are threatened by ocean noise pollution, ship strikes, entanglement in fishing gear and climate change.</p> <p>With all these threats, the ban on commercial whaling needs to be defended. Only then do we stand a chance of a future where whales are once again abundant. Responsible whale-watching \u2013 currently a billion dollar industry \u2013 is the way forward and commercial whaling should be consigned to a watery grave.</p>",
  "<p>Music publisher Chrysalis warned today its revenue from song royalties would fall this year as it predicted an annual loss across the group.</p> <p>The company, whose roster includes the likes of Portishead (above) and Estelle, said the key measure of net publisher's share (NPS), the royalties it receives after writers, performers and right holders have taken their slice, would be lower in the 13 months to the end of September than for the same period last year.</p> <p>It blamed the \"challenging macroeconomic environment\" for hampering sales of CDs. The advertising market downturn affected synchronisation revenue, which it gets when music is used in TV programmes, films and advertisements.</p> <p>Over the 10 months to the end of June, NPS was down 2.9% on last year, reflecting a quiet release schedule in the first half of the year and uncertainty about Chrysalis's future, when it was up for sale. The three months from April to June saw a 12.8% gain, however, thanks to chart hits.</p> <p>Analysts at Investec predicted NPS would fall 9% year on year to \u00a311.1m for the 13 months to the end of September, which is Chrysalis's reporting period this year as it puts back its financial year-end.</p> <p>Since rejecting a bid from EMI and ending talks with other potential buyers in April, Chrysalis has identified growing NPS as a key part of its strategy to boost shareholder value.</p> <p>Chrysalis said its \"incubator\" business Echo, which nurtures artists before they sign deals with major labels, had performed below management expectations, with \"marginally higher\" write-offs for new unproven artists. Echo, which along with other non-publishing assets has been put under review, had not \"upstreamed\" any artists to major labels in the third quarter, Chrysalis said.</p> <p>These factors, along with a quiet period for new releases in the last four months of the year, meant the company predicted an operating loss for the 13 months. </p> <p>Investec suggested this would be in the region of \u00a31.1m, compared with \u00a3300,000 profit last year.<br></p>",
  "<p>As fuel bills look likely to top \u00a3100 per month, the government is thought to be planning additional payments to some of the most vulnerable households. But with significant sources of renewable energy still some way off, the prospect of spending more and more money topping up fuel bills isn't sustainable. </p> <p>Not only will it eat in to precious public funds, but it will do little to change either consumption patterns or cut carbon emissions.</p> <p>There is some good news. The homes being built today will be better for the environment and will be cheaper to heat and power. But 70% of the homes we have today will still be around in 2050. Against this backdrop there is a real danger of new energy wealth gap emerging - between those who can afford to retrofit their homes with insulation and energy saving devices and those who can't.</p> <p>On this basis, what is needed now is not an increasingly expensive temporary fix that will do little to cut demand or consumption. Rather, we need bold leadership to take forward an ambitious approach to mainstreaming retrofitting. Critically this will achieve not only a much more sustainable reduction in fuel poverty but will also help address the 27% of carbon emissions that come from our homes. </p> <p>How tough will this be? Well, it's not unprecedented. Almost 20 years ago, we faced a large proportion of our social housing stock that was in significant decline. By 2010, the decent homes programme will almost be complete. </p> <p>This time, however, we need to think differently - to think bigger - because a similar approach to all existing homes would simply cost too much and take too long. </p> <p>While supporting the most vulnerable must remain our first priority, we must also look at how we can drive down the costs of sustainable technologies. By achieving this, we will be able to make real inroads into fuel poverty levels - taking advantage of already planned (and funded) mainstream upgrading of properties as part and parcel of normal repairs and maintenance cycles. </p> <p>However, if we focus our attention solely on homes then we will fall short in mainstreaming sustainability and driving down costs. One solution lies in widening our thinking to cover the entire construction sector (whether office buildings, schools, hospitals or homes). Imagine what could be gained if there was a coordinated public sector lead across the billions of pounds that are spent annually on defence estates, hospitals, schools, public housing, and municipal buildings. </p> <p>Perhaps it is here that we should be looking for government leadership - and for this leadership to come to the fore sooner rather than later.</p> <p>Acting now may even provide an added bonus. Job losses in the construction sector are on the rise and will provide a real threat to much-needed future infrastructure and housing provision. Mainstreaming sustainability would help mitigate this loss of capacity by driving forward retrofitting, and it would also help open up future opportunities for UK industry in what is a fast growing green technologies market. </p> <p>Either way, inaction is not an option. We need to start work on sustainable solutions now or face a cost to individuals and society that will only get worse.</p> <p><em>Richard Capie is director of policy and practice at the Chartered Institute of Housing</em></p>",
  "<p>A detritus-loving bug that can be found in nearly every garden compost heap in the land could be about to transform the way the world makes biofuels. </p> <p>Initially, it is set to make bioethanol production from corn in the US more efficient, but the British company that has developed it says it can be applied much more broadly.</p> <p>Unlike the yeasts traditionally used in brewing and bioethanol production it is more tolerant of tough plant matter, so raw materials such as grasses, willow, forest waste, wheat stalks and waste cardboard could all be converted into fuel. </p> <p>The company, <a href=\"http://www.tmo-group.com/\">TMO Renewables</a>, has built a trial plant near Guildford in Surrey to demonstrate the process. It is the first plant in the UK to use so-called \"second generation\" raw material - inputs that are not themselves foodstuffs. \"It completely eliminates the debate about food versus fuel,\" says the company's CEO, Hamish Curran. </p> <p>Curran is no hair-shirted, lentil-eating ecowarrior. He began his career in the oil and gas industry and now has a fondness for burning around the Surrey countryside in his convertible BMW. \"You have to be a petrol-head to work here,\" he says as we drive with the wind in our hair to TMO's demonstration plant. The hot maze of hissing and clanging silver-grey pipework is sited next to the track and hangar where the TV show Top Gear is filmed. \"Whilst we want to save the planet, if it's not profitable it's not going to be sustainable,\" says Curran.</p> <p>Critics argue that the massive expansion of biofuel production in the US has displaced food crops and taken land out of food production, contributing to a massive hike in food prices worldwide. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jul/03/biofuels.renewableenergy\">According to a World Bank report</a> obtained by the Guardian earlier this month, the extra demand for agricultural produce and land from biofuels has pushed food prices up by 75%. The US government claims the figure is 3%. </p> <p>Using woody non-food plants would get away from the displacement problem and has long been the goal of the biofuels industry. But so far the technology to do it has proved elusive. The problem is breaking down tough molecules such as cellulose into smaller sugars that can be fermented into ethanol or other fuels. </p> <p>Curran has big plans. \"I see the opportunity within the UK to leapfrog the first generation and go directly to the second generation, making ethanol from biomass,\" he said. But he knows that is not going to happen anytime soon because the infrastructure for supplying the raw materials will take years to build up. </p> <p>In the meantime TMO plans to license its technology to US corn ethanol producers. \"The market is gigantic because of the legislative agenda in the US,\" he said. The fuel ethanol industry is currently worth around $30bn (\u00a316bn) and this year is expected to produce between 9bn and 9.5bn gallons of fuel this year.</p> <p>But making corn ethanol requires a substantial input of fossil fuels, which partially cancels out its green benefits. After fermenting the corn, producers are left with a cloudy ethanol mixture. The cloudiness is a cellulose-rich waste product that needs to be settled out, dried and then disposed of. At the moment producers recover some costs by selling the waste - called distillers dried grains - as cattle feed. That typically means transporting it from a bioethanol plant in the mid-West to a farmer in Texas using huge amounts of energy.</p> <p>However, by feeding it into TMO's process, Curran says a plant could make 15% more ethanol and reduce its energy consumption by 35% to 50%. He says he has already had interest from 22 US bioethanol producers in buying the technology.</p> <p>TMO Renewables began by testing thousands of bacteria from compost heaps, farm silage pits, forest leaf litter - in fact, anywhere where there were rotting plants - and testing how good they were at decomposing plant matter. They eventually settled on a Geobacillus bacterium which was particularly unfussy about what it ate, and set about genetically tweaking it so it stopped converting food into other waste products. That boosted the bug's ethanol production and at the same time the team \"turbo-charged\" its metabolism, as Curran puts it. So rather than taking days to ferment a batch of raw material as yeast would, it can do the same job in hours. </p> <p>The genetically altered bug - christened TM242 to distinguish it from Geobacillus in the wild - is still only part of the way toward the ultimate goal of munching on raw cellulose, however. The fibrous input needs first to be blown apart with high pressure steam and then treated with enzymes to partially break up the long chains that make up cellulose molecules and convert them into sugars. That means adding enzymes to the mix, but unlike other bacteria TM242 can handle longer chain sugars so the cellulose only needs to be partially broken down. </p> <p>Another advantage is that because TM242 operates at 65C to 70C and generates its own heat, the hot beer that comes out of the end of the fermentation process needs less warming to distil off the ethanol, thus saving energy.</p> <p>\"I think they are half way there,\" said Edward Green of Green Biologics in Abingdon, another company that is researching the use of bacteria to create biofuels. \"Whether or not that gives them something unique - probably not. There are other people out there with similar types of microbe, but TMO probably has more of an advanced position in terms of demonstration scale up.\"</p> <p>Some environmental campaigners remain unconvinced, however. A spokesperson for Friends of the Earth, which campaigns against biofuels, says that so-called second generation technologies are not the answer. </p> <p>\"Sustainable second generation biofuels are a PR promise, not a commercial reality \u2013 and are a distraction from real green transport solutions, like more fuel efficient cars, better public transport and safer routes for walking and cycling,\" she said. </p> <p>\"The EU must scrap its proposed biofuels targets and vote instead to double the fuel efficiency of new cars.\"</p>",

  "<p>Stella Artois and ad agency Lowe have parted company after 26 years, bringing to an end one of adland's most enduring and creatively-lauded relationships.</p> <p>The decision, which affects the Lowe Worldwide network, ends a relationship begun by Sir Frank Lowe when he started the agency in the 1980s.</p> <p>Stella Artois is famous for its \"Reassuringly expensive\" strapline and Lowe developed a reputation for stylish, cinematic ads for the beer, notably in the style of Jean de Florette.</p> <p>The beer brand's parent company InBev, which recently handed the advertising business for the launch of its new 4% Stella Artois variant to rival agency Mother, is understood to be set to hold a pitch to handle the business.</p> <p>Lowe, which runs the Stella business from its London headquarters, will not be taking part in the pitch.</p> <p>This year also marked the close of Stella Artois's 30-year relationship with the eponymous tennis tournament at the Queen's Club, a prelude to Wimbledon.</p> <p>Lowe came up with the idea for the sponsorship, but in recent years the Stella brand name has been dropped from the association.</p> <p>Some have argued the decision to drop Stella from the Queen's Club sponsorship was linked to the brand being linked by some with the worst excesses of binge drinking culture, with the company instead promoting the \"Artois family\" of beers.</p> <p>Lowe still retains the global advertising account for InBev's Becks beer brand.</p> <p>Despite Stella acquiring an unsavoury reputation in recent years for fuelling the UK's binge drinking culture, Lowe has maintained its premium brand image by drawing on the continental roots of the beer.</p> <p>Before the advent of the famous Stella TV ads, Lowe produced highly applauded print work for the brand - such as the \"My shout, he whispered\" campaign - in the early 1980s that became the vehicle for the \"Reassuringly expensive\" positioning that was to follow.</p> <p>The early 1990s saw the debut of the first in a string of famous TV ads featuring the flower seller <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuYVq8M7ybs\">\"Jacques\"</a> in the Jean de Florette-inspired series of commercials.</p> <p>A string of epic TV ads followed over the next 15 years, often using black and white footage with a number set during the first world war in France.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msFh08ZsE48\">\"Returning hero\"</a> in 2001 saw a bar owner cunningly squash a beer hose so he did not have to give two war heroes the pints of Stella they so crave.</p> <p>And in 2004 the brand returned to war with <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01mG3RDdf28\">\"Pilot\"</a>, which saw a bar tender giving up a downed fighter pilot who was hiding in his establishment to German soldiers in order to keep his Stella stock safe.</p> <p>Hell boy actor Ron Pearlman starred in the 2003 epic <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OKw3_XTvro\">\"Devil's Island\"</a>, one of the most expensive ads ever made, while ice skating priests in 2005 was one of the most recent epic ads.</p> <p>However, the Stella brand has struggled in recent years to maintain its premium positioning.</p> <p>A chunk of its ad spend has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/sep/21/advertising.marketingandpr\">transferred online</a>, which is where a number cinematic ads have been created, although not all of them have made it to TV and cinema.</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p>Library fines could become a thing of the past if a group of librarians get their way. A fiery debate has been raging for the past week between librarians, with anti-fine campaigners describing the charges as punitive, old-fashioned and creating a negative impression of libraries. </p> <p>\"Libraries are facing competition from television, magazines, the internet, e-books, yet they have this archaic and mad idea of charging people money for being slightly late,\" said library consultant Frances Hendrix - a loud voice in the debate which has been taking place on an online forum for librarians. \"It's all so negative, unprofessional and unbusinesslike; like any business, libraries need not to alienate their customers.\" Liz Dubber, director of programmes at reading charity The Reading Agency, agreed. \"My personal view [is that] they're past their sell-by date because they do sustain a very old-fashioned image of libraries which is out of sync with today's modern library environment and the image libraries are trying to project - tolerant, responsive, flexible, stimulating,\" she said.</p> <p>Rates of fines differ around the country but range from between 10p to 20p per book per day to a maximum of around \u00a35. The anti-fine faction of librarians believes that fines are alienating their users, and with book prices plummeting have also reached the point where they are sometimes more expensive than purchasing the book. One librarian wrote online: \"I've met plenty of ex-borrowers...who say they paid a few medium-sized fines and decided it was cheaper and more convenient for them to buy the books - and stopped using the library.\" </p> <p>The other side of the debate points out that without fines, customers are unlikely to return their books. Alison Wheeler, adult services manager at Suffolk Libraries, told the Guardian that her personal view was that some people do need the \"occasional financial nudge\" to remind them about doing the right thing. \"No one would argue against a parking or speeding fine - if we didn't have speeding fines it wouldn't mean that people behaved better on the roads,\" she added.</p> <p>The pro-fine faction also says that without the income from fines, some local authorities would suffer a significant reduction in their budgets. One librarian estimated that fines brought in \u00a3250,000 to his council last year, and stressed that \"if fines were removed as an income stream, no matter what the strength of argument might be, it would seriously challenge the budgetary position of many library services.\" Hendrix ridiculed this idea. \"When fine income is being used by libraries to run libraries, I think it's madness,\" she said. \"We've got to the stage that our fines are now paying for the library service.\" </p> <p>Librarian Loz Pycock asked how libraries that want to ditch fines would go about retrieving their books from negligent readers. \"We never have enough copies of Driving Theory Test manuals or the Life in the UK citizenship books on the shelves. How do we stop borrowers from keeping the books for the months up to their tests and depriving other users? I don't believe the public are all selfish but it only needs a very small percentage of bad apples to cause problems.\" </p> <p>One librarian suggested adopting the ancient practice of some monasteries, in which monks who offended in the handling of books were publicly cursed. Another pointed to Soviet Russia, where they said that offenders' names were published in newspapers to shame them into returning their books. In New Zealand town Palmerston North next week, library users returning late books are being challenged to beat librarians on Guitar Hero to have their fines waived. </p> <p>Dubber said that with local authorities around the country all charging different rates of fines, perhaps the only way to abolish the charges would be for central government to legislate and make good the drop in local income for every authority. Wheeler suggested the framework should be changed to reflect people's ability to pay the charges. <br> A spokesperson for libraries body the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council said: \"This is primarily a matter for library authorities, but clearly it is in the interests of all library users that books are returned on time. MLA best practice advice would to recommend that authorities politely alert customers before they go overdue and to avoid the word 'fine' in preference for 'charge'.\"</p>",
  "<p>The pound continued to tumble against the dollar today, hitting its lowest level in two years due to the weakening economy and fears that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jul/26/economics.economicgrowth\">UK may slip into its first recession</a> since the early 1990s.</p> <p>Extending its recent losses, sterling was down 0.9% in morning trading to $1.8514. The last time the pound was this weak against the dollar was July 2006. It also marked the 11th straight day of falls - the longest run of losses in 37 years.</p> <p>\"The US was the first economy to hit trouble\" in the current global economic crisis, said Tim Clayton, chief strategist at Investica. \"Now people are realizing that the UK has the same problems as the US, if not more so.\"</p> <p>\"Sterling is being hit on all sides at the moment with a broad-based dollar rebound and the realisation that the UK economy is facing a very difficult period,\" said Geraldine Concagh, economist at AIB Group Treasury.</p> <p>The pound's fall also reflects a strengthening dollar, which is benefiting from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/13/oil.energy\">falling commodities prices</a> and fears over the European economy. Yesterday the 15-nation eurozone registered its first contraction since the single currency was introduced over a decade ago.</p> <p>The outlook for the UK however is less optimistic with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/06/manufacturing.economics\">signs of weakening on all fronts</a>. </p> <p>Data earlier this week showed unemployment rose at its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/14/unemploymentdata.economicgrowth\">fastest rate for 15 1/2 years</a>. Meanwhile falling house prices, large trade and budget deficits and slowing economic growth are all putting pressure on the pound even though inflation is currently at a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/12/inflation.creditcrunch\">16-year high</a> and well above the Bank's 2% target.</p> <p>Sterling started falling dramatically after the Bank of England's inflation report on Wednesday. Bank governor Mervyn King <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/14/inflation.bankofenglandgovernor\">downgraded UK growth</a> saying it would be broadly flat for the rest of the year, but not ruling out the possibility of the economy experiencing two quarters of negative growth - the common definition of a recession. </p> <p>As a result, financial markets are now expecting the Bank to cut interest rates as early as the year end and again in early 2009. This is putting further downward pressure on the pound since if interest rates fall sterling deposits become less profitable, prompting investors to flee from the currency.</p> <p>News of a falling pound is bad news for British holidaymakers who have been enjoying favourably high exchange rates on their trips abroad. However, it provides much-needed relief for British businesses, including exporters and the tourism industry, whose products and services will become more affordable to potential customers around the world.</p> <p>The euro also made gains against the pound, up 0.2% at 79.35p. Measured against a basket of trade-weighted currencies, the pound is now at its weakest level since 1996.</p>",
  "<p>Much of the global warming debate is perhaps best described as a constant outbidding by frantic campaigners, producing a barrage of ever-more scary scenarios in an attempt to get the public to accept their civilisation-changing proposals. Unfortunately, the general public \u2013 while concerned about the environment \u2013 is distinctly unwilling to support questionable solutions with costs running into tens of trillions of pounds. Predictably, this makes the campaigners reach for even more outlandish scares.</p> <p>These alarmist predictions are becoming quite bizarre, and could be dismissed as sociological oddities, if it weren't for the fact that they get such big play in the media. Oliver Tickell, for instance, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/11/climatechange\">writes that</a> a global warming causing a 4C temperature increase by the end of the century would be a \"catastrophe\" and the beginning of the \"extinction\" of the human race. This is simply silly.</p> <p>His evidence? That 4C would mean that all the ice on the planet would melt, bringing the long-term sea level rise to 70-80m, flooding everything we hold dear, seeing billions of people die. Clearly, Tickell has maxed out the campaigners' scare potential (because there is no more ice to melt, this is the scariest he could ever conjure). But he is wrong. Let us just remember that the UN climate panel, the <a href=\"http://www.ipcc.ch/index.htm\">IPCC</a>, expects a temperature rise by the end of the century between 1.8 and 6.0C. Within this range, the IPCC predicts that, by the end of the century, sea levels will rise 18-59 <em>centimetres</em> \u2013 Tickell is simply exaggerating by a factor of up to <em>400</em>.</p> <p>Tickell will undoubtedly claim that he was talking about what <em>could</em> happen many, many millennia from now. But this is disingenuous. First, the 4C temperature rise is predicted on a century scale \u2013 this is what we talk about and can plan for. Second, although sea-level rise will continue for many centuries to come, the models unanimously show that Greenland's ice shelf will be reduced, but Antarctic ice will increase even more (because of increased precipitation in Antarctica) for the next three centuries. What will happen beyond that clearly depends much more on emissions in future centuries. Given that CO2 stays in the atmosphere about a century, what happens with the temperature, say, six centuries from now mainly depends on emissions five centuries from now (where it seems unlikely non-carbon emitting technology such as solar panels will not have become economically competitive). </p> <p>Third, Tickell tells us how the 80m sea-level rise would wipe out all the world's coastal infrastructure and much of the world's farmland \u2013 \"undoubtedly\" causing billions to die. But to cause billions to die, it would require the surge to occur within a single human lifespan. This sort of scare tactic is insidiously wrong and misleading, mimicking a firebrand preacher who claims the earth is coming to an end and we need to repent. While it is probably true that the sun will burn up the earth in 4-5bn years' time, it does give a slightly different perspective on the need for immediate repenting. </p> <p>Tickell's claim that 4C will be the beginning of our extinction is again many times beyond wrong and misleading, and, of course, made with no data to back it up. Let us just take a look at the realistic impact of such a 4C temperature rise. For the <a href=\"http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Default.aspx?ID=788\">Copenhagen Consensus</a>, one of the lead economists of the IPCC, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Yohe\">Professor Gary Yohe</a>, did a survey of all the problems and all the benefits accruing from a temperature rise over this century of about approximately 4C. And yes, there will, of course, also be benefits: as temperatures rise, more people will die from heat, but fewer from cold; agricultural yields will decline in the tropics, but increase in the temperate zones, etc.</p> <p>The model evaluates the impacts on agriculture, forestry, energy, water, unmanaged ecosystems, coastal zones, heat and cold deaths and disease. The bottom line is that benefits from global warming right now <em>outweigh</em> the costs (the benefit is about 0.25% of global GDP). Global warming will continue to be a net benefit until about 2070, when the damages will begin to outweigh the benefits, reaching a total damage cost equivalent to about 3.5% of GDP by 2300. This is simply not the end of humanity. If anything, global warming is a net benefit now; and even in three centuries, it will not be a challenge to our civilisation. Further, the IPCC expects the average person on earth to be 1,700% richer by the end of this century.</p> <p>Tickell's hellfire and damnation sermon also misinforms us of the solutions to global warming: panicking is rarely the right state of mind for finding smart solutions. In essence, Tickell says that because the outlook is so frightening, we need to cut much, much more than the <a href=\"http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/items/2830.php\">Kyoto protocol</a> called for. Now, all peer-reviewed, published economic models demonstrate that such an effort is a colossal waste of money \u2013 one of the leading models shows that, for every pound spent, Tickell's solution would do about 13p-worth of good.</p> <p>Tickell finds that current climate efforts like Kyoto have been \"miserable failures\", which is true, but makes it seem rather odd that he thinks much-more-of-the-same will suddenly be great policy. He claims that the reason these policies are not realised is because our governments are \"craven to special interests\". While this is convenient to believe, it is, of course, incorrect; the real reason is that no one in the electorate wants to pay \u00a32, \u00a33 or even \u00a34 for a litre of petrol. </p> <p>If we are to find a workable and economically smart solution, we would do well to look at the best climate solution from the top economists from the Copenhagen Consensus. They found that, unlike even moderate CO2 cuts, which cost more than they do good, we should focus on investing in finding cheaper low-carbon energy. This requires us to invest massively in energy research and development (R&amp;D). Right now, we don't \u2013 because the climate panic makes us focus exclusively on cutting CO2. </p> <p>R&amp;D has been dropping worldwide since the early 1980s. If we increased this investment ten-fold, it would still be ten times cheaper than Kyoto, and probably hundreds to thousands of times cheaper than Tickell's proposal. The literature indicates that for every pound invested, we would do \u00a311-worth of good. The reason: because when we all talk about cutting CO2, we might get some well-meaning westerners to put up a few inefficient solar panels on their roof-tops. While it costs a lot, it will do little and have no impact on Chinese and Indian emissions. But if we focus on <em>investing</em> in making cheaper solar panels, they will become competitive sooner, making everyone, including the Chinese and Indians, switch. </p> <p>Such a proposal is efficient, politically feasible and will actually fix climate change in the medium term. Being panicked by incorrect data and suggesting outlandish policies might create a splash, but it will stall our prospects of achieving real change.</p> <p>Let's not be silly \u2013 let's choose the best solution.</p>",
  "<p>Reuters plays straight into the Obama-as-celebrity theme (yeah, I suppose <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/usa/2008/08/friday_memo_bodysurfin_usa.html\">I did too</a>) with <a href=\"http://blogs.reuters.com/trail08/2008/08/15/obama-takes-shirt-off-again-goes-body-surfing-in-hawaii/\">this headline</a>:</p> <blockquote> Obama takes shirt off again, goes body surfing in Hawaii </blockquote> <br> <p>...prompting this immediate media email from the McCain campaign:</p> <blockquote> You know you may just be a global celebrity when you get this headline in Reuters, \"Obama Takes Shirt Off Again, Goes Body Surfing In Hawaii.\" </blockquote> <br> <p>I know!

  "<p>The company at the centre of this year's Sats test debacle had its contract terminated today by the government's exams watchdog.</p> <p>The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority and ETS Europe agreed to dissolve the five-year contract to handle the national curriculum tests with immediate effect, after test results were delayed this summer. Under the deal, ETS will make a payment of \u00a319.5m to QCA, and the watchdog will save approximately \u00a34.6m in cancelled invoices and charges.</p> <p>Full results for tests sat by 14-year-olds this year were still not available when national figures were released earlier this week.</p> <p>The agreement to end the contract early has been made by both parties and there will be no payments made by QCA to ETS Europe for any future years of the contract.</p> <p>It was feared QCA would have to pay off ETS Europe for breaking the deal.</p> <p>QCA signed the \u00a3156m five-year contract with ETS in February last year. However, serious problems with the administration and marking of the tests this year meant the publication of results for key stage 2 and 3, which should have been released on July 8, were delayed by almost a month. KS3 results were released on Tuesday, although schools still did not have complete results.</p> <p>ETS will continue to work to conclude this year's Sats operations, publishing outstanding results and making sure all schools have a complete set of results and any unreturned scripts.</p> <p>Schools are expected to call for a record number of remarks over disputed results this year.</p> <p>The QCA said information about the arrangements for next year's Sats tests would be made available to schools in the autumn.</p> <p>The exams regulator, Ofqual, has asked Lord Sutherland to lead an <a href=\"http://sutherlandinquiry.independent.gov.uk/callforevidence.shtml\">inquiry</a> into the delays in this year's Sats results, which will conclude in the autumn.</p> <p>The Conservatives have asked Sir Richard Sykes, the former vice-chancellor of Imperial College, London, to carry out a <a href=\"http://education.theguardian.com/sats/story/0,,2291962,00.html\">separate inquiry</a> into the debacle.</p> <p>Last month, ministers refused to sever the contract with ETS. Ed Balls, the schools secretary, insisted that negotiations should be kept \"at arms length from ministers, to ensure the independence and objectivity of the testing regime\".</p> <p>Ken Boston, the QCA's chief executive, said today: \"ETS Europe was selected due to the strength of their worldwide experience in delivering large scale assessments.</p> <p>\"It is disappointing that the issues with this year's national curriculum test results have meant that the partnership between QCA and ETS Europe must end early.\"</p> <p>Zoubir Yazid, ETS Global BV's managing director, said: \"ETS Europe has apologised to schools for the delays in marking national curriculum assessments in England.</p> <p>\"As a subsidiary of a global, non-profit company, we are dedicated to assuring quality and equity for all pupils, and we are sorry that the results this summer were delayed for some schools.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/pns/DisplayPN.cgi?pn_id=2008_0175\">letter</a> to the Commons schools select committee chairman, Barry Sheerman, the schools secretary said the contractual discussions have legally been a matter for the QCA and ETS.</p> <p>He added: \"My department has sought to ensure that due process has been followed throughout, that the public purse is protected.\"</p> <p>Balls said that contractual costs to the end of the 2008 test cycle were \u00a339.6m, of which \u00a324.1m had been recovered from the \u00a335m ETS Europe received from QCA.</p> <p>He said schools now had 99% of KS2 and 95% of KS3 results - 93% in English, 97% in maths and 96% in science.</p> <p>Balls told Sheerman the Sutherland inquiry would help \"learn the lessons of this year's delays\" and QCA would offer a single year contract to run the 2009 Sats.</p> <p>The shadow schools secretary, Michael Gove, said today's announcement was long overdue.</p> <p>\"ETS had a long history of international failure before they were signed up by this government to run Sats tests. Ministers bear direct responsibility for signing up with a firm that let down children and teachers so badly,\" he said.</p> <p>Mary Bousted, the general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, called for next year's Sats to be cancelled.</p> <p>\"It is simply not possible for the QCA to appoint a new test contractor to deliver the Sats exams for 2009,\" she said.</p> <p>\"The government needs to take this golden opportunity to completely overhaul its testing regime, and in the interim should suspend Sats for 2009.\"</p> <p>John Dunford, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, agreed.</p> <p>\"Nine months is an incredibly short time in which to appoint a new provider, prepare the infrastructure and recruit and train markers. Many markers have lost confidence in the system and, even with ETS out of the picture, it will be difficult to deliver a wholly successful system in 2009,\" he said.</p> <p>The testing and examination system is \"sinking under its own weight\", he added, and it is time for the government to \"examine seriously how it can streamline the assessment regime and again make it fit for purpose\".</p> <p>Chris Keates, the general secretary of the NASUWT teachers' union, said the termination of the contract was \"good news\". But the Sutherland review would be \"critically important\" to identify the causes of the problems and to try to ensure that they do not arise in the future, she said.</p> <p>\"Given the high stakes nature of testing, schools, teachers, parents and presumably the government will want to ensure that the inquiry examines fully the implications of arms-length private companies being charged with such onerous responsibilities.\"</p>",

  "<p>London's <a href=\"http://www.capitalradio.co.uk/default.asp\">Capital 95.8</a> is suffering an embarrassing isolation, seemingly trapped in the hell of eternal puberty, struggling to find its own identity and acceptance among its peers, <strong>writes Paul Smith</strong>.</p> <p>One of the first rules of radio is that a station needs consistency to prosper, through its brand, its music, its schedule - or ideally all three. Even if a station's music is as varied as <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/\">Radio 2</a> or <a href=\"http://www.jackfm.co.uk/\">Jack FM</a>, it must be consistent in its approach and the context in which the output is presented. And radio shows rarely rely on ensemble casts that can survive without their star; listeners don't respond kindly to their favourite presenters being chopped and switched.</p> <p>Over the past couple of years, Capital's music and schedules appear to have been put through a mincer and fed to a clutter of cats. Leading the way, a breakfast show that last week bid farewell its third co-presenter, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/aug/04/radio.gcapmedia\">Denise Van Outen</a>, in just four years.</p> <p>Presenters and staff had previously been told the station schedule would remain unchanged for the forseeable future, so the exit of a personality like Van Outen is significant, in that it will cause further uncertainty for listeners. While the station won't see its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/jul/29/radio.rajarradioaudiencefigures\">Rajar figure's nosedive</a> as they did when Johnny Vaughan replaced Chris Tarrant in 2004, the loss and introduction of yet another host will be felt.</p> <p>Which brings us to another rule of radio; succession planning. Before your long-established breakfast show signs off for good, make sure the torch has been passed to their replacement. New flagship shows for Radio 1 and Radio 2 may be half a decade away, but the heirs to the breakfast throne are already well established in the schedules.</p> <p>When Capital waved goodbye to Tarrant, it changed the whole tone and offering of the station. Despite knowing that Tarrant's days were numbered, management prepared for the inevitable loss in listeners by sticking its fingers in its ears and whistling loudly. Vaughan was brought in cold, not only to the Capital audience but to radio.</p> <p>Throw in three or four station rebrands in three years, wholesale changes in management and ownership and you have a station that looks like a burglar's dog.</p> <p>So what next for Capital? New owners <a href=\"http://www.globalradiosales.com/global/\">Global Radio</a> are all about brands, not stations. There's talk of Power FM in Portsmouth, <a href=\"http://www.xfmscotland.co.uk/\">Xfm in Scotland</a> and London's <a href=\"http://www.choice-fm.co.uk/default.asp\">Choice FM</a> all rebranding as <a href=\"http://www.galaxyfm.co.uk/\">Galaxy</a> to strengthen the existing network of four Galaxy licences.</p> <p>It also seems likely that GCap's former <a href=\"http://commercial.gcapmedia.com/index.php?id=8\">One Network</a> of local stations will be rebranded as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_%28radio_network%29\">Heart</a>, with 106.2 providing a shop window to this quasi-national brand for media buyers. With Capital falling by the wayside, Global needs Heart to continue delivering in London and drive advertising spend out into the regions. Once its fierce rival, Heart 106.2 is now Capital's wicked step-sister.</p> <p>The flipside of not being part of a Global gang is that Capital could become a true London station once more, without having to compromise its output for the sake of local radio networking. It would mean Global having to adopt a radically different approach; to have both Heart and Capital compete for a similar audience simply divides the potential spoils, leaving Bauer's <a href=\"http://www.magic.co.uk/home.asp\">Magic 105.4</a> to continue dominating the London market.</p> <p>There have even been calls by some commentators for Global to sell Capital, but that seems unlikely. Besides, putting your kids up for adoption because they're socially inept, while incredibly tempting, could mean losing out on a bigger prize.</p> <p>There's an opportunity to make Capital 95.8 the true sound of London once again. But will it become the golden child or the black sheep of the Global family?</p>",
  "<p>The Prince of Wails is at it again. Ten years ago Prince Charles announced that scientists were entering \"realms that belong to God and God alone\" by dabbling in GM crops (and having been appointed by God to rule over us \u2013 he should know). Now, in interview with the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?xml=/earth/2008/08/12/eacharles112.xml\">Daily Telegraph</a> his Royal Highness revisits the subject \u2013 throwing over the God references in favour of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_K._Dick\">Philip K Dick</a>. </p> <p>\"Throughout our conversation he has been calm, measured and disinclined to rubbish the supermarket chains,\" the Prince's interviewer Jeff Randall revealed. \"But my suggestion that Big Food, industrial-scale operators, are the way ahead sends him whizzing off piste. Jabbing his finger at me, he lets rip: 'What, all run by gigantic corporations? Is that really the answer? I think not. That would be the absolute destruction of everything and ... the classic way of ensuring that there is no food in the future'.\"</p> <p>This is, of course, cracked. The classic way of ensuring there is no food in the future is to grow it all by hand on small inefficient farms without pesticides, leaving matters entirely at the mercy of a bad harvest. But his Royal Highness warms to his theme nevertheless. </p> <p>\"Bouncing in his chair, the Prince sets out his nightmare vision, a world in which millions of small farmers 'are driven off their land [by global conglomerates] into unsustainable, unmanageable, degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness'.\"</p> <p>Sod the farmers. What about the rest of us? Are we to be driven back into the fields because the future king likes the patina of farmyards? As a result of ditching lots of small farms for fewer and bigger ones, society has come on in leaps and bounds. </p> <p>While Charles' great-grandfather spent his life in a similarly cosseted state to Charles himself (having a valet iron his newspaper, put toothpaste on his toothbrush; occasionally exhausting himself having people bow at him) my great-grandfather was an agricultural labourer. (I'll hazard a guess, and suggest yours probably was, too.) After toiling away all day - on a farm he had no share in - to produce food that would be sold in the village, he came back home and tended to the vegetables he was growing for his family in both the front and back garden. </p> <p>Apart from a four-year sabbatical in and around Passchendaele and Mesopotamia, Walter Hill spent his life in a routine of never-ending food production \u2013 raising a family in his spare time. If Charles had his way, all food would be produced in this way again, and vast tracts of the populace, who currently buy things from supermarkets and don't have to spend the better part of their lives growing it in the fields, are freed up to enjoy all the opportunities for which we have mass production to thank. </p> <p>Note that you have never seen Charles digging up a vegetable in his life. He may have spent the 1980s talking to his plants (\"Just come and talk to the plants, really,\" he once advised to universal derision. \"Very important to talk to them, they respond, I find.\") But it was all talk \u2013 just foreplay \u2013 at no point did his Royal Highness actually get down and dirty in the soilbeds, sweating and back-breaking, with a fork and a spade. When he says we need to farm sustainably, he means us --\u2013 not him. </p> <p>As the Times science correspondent, Mark Henderson, <a href=\" http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/science/article4523786.ece\">explains</a> \"few of [his claims] are based on data from the real world. While some of the agricultural and environmental problems he highlights are clearly genuine, his explanations for them are long on bombast and short on evidence.\" There is no scientific evidence implicating GM crops in climate change \u2013 which predates their invention. Not is there any evidence that biotechnology is a \"gigantic experiment with nature and the whole of humanity that has gone seriously wrong\". </p> <p>\"Hundreds of millions of consumers in the United States have been eating GM food for 12 years, with no evidence of any health problems.\" The salination problems in Western Australia \u2013 which Charles lumped at the door of GM \u2013 are nothing to do with GM at all: \"GM crops have not contributed to the problem, but they may help to offer a medium-term solution. Scientists are working actively to develop new crop varieties that require less water and that grow in more saline soils, using both transgenic and conventional breeding techniques.\"</p> <p>What's really \"unmentionably awful\" in this scenario is the respect society is still according to the royals. Prince Charles, dense even by aristocratic standards, and with a history of prescribing coffee <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/society/2004/jun/27/themonarchy.medicineandhealth \">cures</a> for cancer, should have no influence on the GM debate whatsoever. To update <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/06/monarchy.military\">Willie Hamilton</a>, why do we continue to tolerate a status quo in which a farm worker or a factory worker can work a lifetime without earning \"as much as we pay that twerp in a year?\" I'm not so churlish as to claim that Prince Charles has never done anything for our society (he has of course invented a new vowel all by himself \"aieeeeeyyyyy\") but he hasn't done enough to start firing off self-important claims that we can \"count him out\" of future scenarios that involve a plentiful food supply. </p> <p>If only Prince Charles would confine himself to his former principal ambition -\u2013 to become Camilla's <a href=\" http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2294/is_54/ai_n27052712\">tampon</a> \u2013 he could finally do something useful: in sparing us the insult of being sporadically bashed about the brain with nonsense by a living anachronism.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>Russell will be here from 1.55am...</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>1.59am:</strong> Morning all, and welcome to day seven. Plenty of action in store, with 18 gold medals on offer. Some would say the Games hit top gear today with the beginning of the track and field programme, but I'm not so sure. Until we see the first report of bedroom marathons and empty condom wrappers strewn about the Athletes' Village the Games haven't truly reached full speed, I reckon - but then I've always been a romantic.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>2.04am:</strong> Aside from the track and field, the nation of Phelpsia will dive back into the Water Cube this morning to resume climbing up the medal tally (he is now 11th, one behind Great Britain), and the 200m individual medley should offer little resistance to the young country's gold medal march.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>2.12am:</strong> Let's head out to the Bird's Nest, as Britain's <strong>Kelly Sotherton</strong> begins her heptathlon assault. The true test, of course, will come later in the javelin - not exactly her strong suit - but there's no harm in kicking off with a decent showing this morning in the 100m hurdles. The absence of the Athens 2004 gold medallist, Carolina Kluft of Sweden, can't hurt either.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>2.23am:</strong> Britain's other heptathlon hope, <strong>Julie Hollman</strong>, is first up for GB, and she finishes fourth in her heat. Hollman says that her most humorous moment was being sick during an 800m race - which is exactly how I'd react after running 800m.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>2.32am:</strong> Across at the men's shot put, we see Reese Hoffa - the 51st American state, by the look of him - propel the pill 21.41m. Reckon he then went off to eat a pizza or 12 for elevenses.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>2.29am:</strong> <strong>Sotherton</strong> sets off now, and looks confident as she clears the hurdles with ease to finish fourth in her heat in 13.18sec. That impressive effort gives her 1,097 points and places her fourth overall, with Hyleas Fountain of the US leading on 1,158 points. High jump next.<br>See our <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/15/olympics2008.britisholympicteam1 \">full report</a> of Sotherton's opening effort</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>2.45am:</strong> Now to the fast show, the men's 100m sprint. Two rounds today, final tomorrow. Usain Bolt, the Jamaican juggernaut who runs like a rugby league winger in need of a ball, is in the first heat. He's only run seven 100m races, but he's still managed to set a world record so the lad's got talent.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>2.50am:</strong> La, la, la, la, la, la: that was the sound of Bolt humming a merry tune as he strolled to the line in 10.20sec. Sweat? Not on this bloke, not when he's virtually walked into the second round. Ironic that surname, no?</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>2.54am:</strong> Asafa Powell - don't call him Yesterday's Man, not yet at least - is next up, along with Great Britain's <strong>Craig Pickering</strong>.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>2.58am:</strong> So far so good for Asafa, who jogs through to win in 10.16sec. <strong>Pickering</strong> runs an impressive 10.21 to finish third and qualify for the second round. The Brit seemed to require just a bit more effort, though.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>3.12am:</strong> Off to the pool now, where Australia's Lethal Liesel Jones attempts to win an elusive Olympic gold medal, in the 200m breaststroke final.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>3.16am:</strong> And it remains elusive for the Australian. Rebecca Soni of the US has no trouble keeping up with the Jones girl and trumps her on the last leg to win the gold medal in 2min 20.22sec. That's another world record in the Cube - is it time we introduced handicaps?</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>3.24am:</strong> To the men's 200m backstroke final, and for once the name Phelps is nowhere to be seen on the results board. Of course, that's because he's not in the race, which was won by his fellow American Ryan Lochte in 1:53.94. Another world record? Silly question. GB's <strong>Gregor Tait</strong> finishes eighth in 1:57, and announces he's going off to Australia for a while. Finishing eighth isn't that bad, surely?</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>3.29am:</strong> Back to the track, and the US of A's Tyson Gay eases into the 100m second round in 10.22m, slower than his two main rivals but we're talking 0.02sec difference across the three sprinters. Splitting hairs at this stage, perhaps.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>3.32am:</strong> Hang on a second, says Great Britain's <strong>Tyrone Edgar</strong>, who coasts to victory in the following 100m heat in 10.13sec. Cuts a glance across the line as if to say: \"Don't you forget about me, don't, don't, don't, don't.\"</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>3.37am:</strong> Humble apologies to Liesel Jones, who of course won the 100m breaststroke gold medal this week. Think I was sleeping at the time. Nice to know you're out there, readers.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>3.50am: </strong>Here comes Mr Phelps. Five golds so far and now on the blocks for a sixth here in the 200m individual medley.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>3.55am: </strong>Another gold, another world record. The American master touches in 1:54.23 for gold No6. GB's <strong>James Goddard</strong> finishes sixth in 1:59.24 while <strong>Liam Tancock</strong> is eighth in 2:00.76.</p> <p>Read the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/15/olympics2008.olympicsaquatics2\">full report</a> on Phelps' latest triumph</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>3.58am:</strong> Shamini from Singapore writes to offer this early-morning brainwave on how to make these Olympics better: \"Why not superimpose Brad Pitt's head on Phelps for TV?

If beach volleyball gets a starter's shirt, why not let WWE wrestlers have a crack at Olympic medals? Imagine Batista preparing to finish off John Cena and claim gold, only for JBL to arrive on the scene and smash a chair over the Animal's head? Now <em>that's</em> an Olympic sport.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>4.05am:</strong> GB's <strong>Elizabeth Simmonds</strong> qualifies seventh for the women's 200m backstroke final after finishing her semi-final in 2:08.96.

A Vietnamese artistic gymnast, who finished out of the medals, has also tested positive for a banned substance, she said. I've just had a coffee, but I'm sure it's far from performance-enhancing.

Over to strong, strong runner Alan Gardner.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>5.49am: 'Sup?</strong> Big praise indeed from Russell... I've been limbering up in the background, and he must have noticed my impressive calves. Although, my desk-accustomed frame has got nothing on either the gymnasts or the beach volleyballers who are currently occupying my attention. And I think the US girls have just nailed their routines in the women's all-around. Is it going to be a dainty slap upside the head for China?</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>5.54am:</strong> Chants of <strong>USA! USA! USA!</strong> in the National Indoor Stadium. Shawn Johnson, the pint-sized princess of American gymnastics - who appears to have been confected entirely from pink satin and sunbeams - is lapping up the applause. Blue Peter's Matt Baker doesn't think she's quite done enough though...</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>5.57am: USA! USA! USA! take gold... and silver.</strong> China will have to suck their thumb whilst clutching bronze. Baker called it: Johnson had to settle for second; but Nastia Liukin, also a Yank, picked up gold. <strong>Britain's Becky Downie finished a respectable 12th.</strong></p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>6.00am: Psychedelic cartoon alert.</strong> Must mean it's time for Olympic Breakfast, with the Beeb's finest. Once the animated pigs and monkeys have trotted off, of course...</p> <p>Opinions on Jamie Hewlett's creations? Personally, it seems to have sod all to do with the Games - but looks quite nice.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>6.05am:</strong> And welcome to the global conversation, Australia: \"Where are Britain's next six gold medals coming from then?\" flaming galas Adrian Hill. \"If the Brits are going to beat Australia, that's what you'll need. As for the overall medals count, roll on 2012, eh?\"</p> <p>Well, Adrian, may I point you in the direction of this <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympicscycling\">little section of our site</a>? On yer bike, mate.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>6.10am:</strong> Not a whole lorra 'lympics going on at the moment, as far as I can tell, not least because BBC1 have decided that some events in this country are in some way newsworthy, which I doubt, frankly. Anyway, as part of their services to japery and clowning around, those zany Spaniards have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/15/olympics2008.olympicstennis\">been at it again</a>. When will they learn...?</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>6.13am: Team GB sailing</strong> You'd have thought with all the corporate suits and politico types guffing their way around Beijing, such a lack wouldn't be problematic, but <strong>we currently have no sailing over in Qingdao because there's no wind.</strong> Ainslie and the Yngling girls are cooling their heels, and possibly drinking some lovely, lovely green tea.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>6.17am: Team GB athletics</strong> Yes, that does read athletics. Kelly Sotherton, one of only two people in Britain who can run without her legs falling off, is doing a cracking job over in the heptathlon. Last I heard she'd gone over 1.77m in the high jump, but it looks like she may have just bettered that.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>6.20am:</strong> Sotherton knocks the bar off at 1.83m, but I think, in going over 1.80m, she's already set a new PB. The American, Hayleas Fountain leads after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/15/olympics2008.britisholympicteam1\">storming through the 100m hurdles this morning</a>. But Kelly's just floated over at 1.83m!!! G'wan Kel!</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>6.26am: Team GB archery</strong> Alan Wills' defeat in the men's singles is being re-lived on the Beeb, while Eurosport have gone with this morning's 100m heats.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Andrew Jolly has joined the Aussie de-baiting: \"Yes, as a Brit living in Australia, I've been talking up our cycling team whilst the Aussies sweep up at the swimming (except this morning where Libby &amp; Liesel threw it away). It's a good job choking isn't an attribute of supposedly superior British sports people. Eh? Oh.\" And some classic self-deprecation to round things off. Mr Jolly, you are wasted down there.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>6.31am:</strong> Seems the <a href=\"http://www.olympics.org.uk/beijing2008/AthleteProfile.aspx?id=5585\">Team GB website</a> tells lies about our Kelly, who has in fact jumped 1.87m before. Anyway, there's some judo going on, and some badminton... not that we have much interest in either now.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>6.34am: Acronym fun, with Al Parkes.</strong> \"As for yngling [cf. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/14/olympics2008.britisholympicteam1\">yesterday's MBM</a>, 7.15am], when faced with 'epee', and thinking it might be a typo, I googled it and the first thing that caught my eye was 'european partnership for energy and the environment'\" writes Al. \"Sounds worthy, but what do the participants actually do? Do they win points for the extent to which they 'reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the use of refrigerants'?\" Another convoluted Olympic sport in the offing, maybe.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>6.40am:</strong> Cuba and the US are locked at 2-2 in the <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=blurnsball\">blurnsball</a>. Still not enough wind for the sailors to have a paddle, so we're reduced to Uzbekistan v Poland in the men's judo.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>6.44am:</strong> Mr Jolly cranks up the pressure on the MBM team (me). \"For some reason, Channel 7 and SBS in Australia aren't covering the athletics today - at the moment we have the mouthwatering choice of Chinese Taipei vs Hong Kong in table tennis or Australia vs Holland in water polo (we don't have new fangled things like 'the red button') down under yet.\" Cue, dramatic music and scenes of MBMer perspiring profusely: \"We're relying completely on MBM to know how the lovely Kelly et al are getting on.\"</p> <p>Well, er... I, er, hang on... just let me switch the chann... bye!</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>6.50am: Fleeing MBMer hits electrified fence around Rebranded Website compound and is corralled back to his seat.</strong> Never fear, text-based sports commentary fans, I'm still here. Not much to report on viz. Ms Sotherton, as there are about 313 competitors in the heptathlon so the high jump wil be some time in finishing.</p> <p>More scandal news, however. According to Reuters, the Chinese faked the ethnicity of some of the kids at the opening ceremony. For shame.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>6.55am:</strong> More people in need, this time Amy from America and Max from Germany who are \"on hols without TV and are counting on you!\" Great. At least their request is simple. Yes, Amy and Max, Germany do have eight golds, our table is just reluctant to acknowledge the facts currently.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>7.00am:</strong> An Estonian judoka is trying to give his Brazilian opponent what looks like a chinese burn. Must be something in the Beijing air. Meanwhile, word is that Kel failed at 1.83m, so my earlier optimism was misplaced/erroneous.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>7.03am:</strong> Peru v Cuba on the mat... and Cuba hands out some ippon pain straight away. Still 2-2 in the baseball.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>7.07am:</strong> If you missed the exciting denouement to USA! USA! USA! crushing 'One World. One Dream' China in the gymnastics earlier, why not read the full report <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/15/olympicsgymnastics.olympics2008\">here</a>. The fun part is... wait for it, wait for it... really, a Russian won. What a delightful Cold War triptych, eh.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>7.12am: Are you listening, Australia? You're rubbish.</strong> Or words to that effect. \"As a Brit living in Brisbane, i'm wondering if the Aussies, following on from the rugby world cup - where the rules must now be changed so that a team with no scrum can win - will now float some ELVs for swimming,\" enquires John Davis, with a mischievous grin all over his mush. \"I mean the Americans getting from the start to the finish in the fastest time, whilst following a straight line, is something of a hollow victory isn't it?\"</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>7.17am: Chiles shows some love.</strong> The Beeb are running (Australian former world record holder) Leisel Jones choking in the 200m breaststroke again, from earlier this morning. But before that, we had Adrian Chiles flapping his chops about the Guardian and in particular <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/14/michaelphelps.swimming1\">this piece on Michael Phelps' diet</a>.

Can you contain your, etc and so forth...</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>7.25am:</strong> No sailing, remember, due to a lack of wind. The French judoka, who looks like a bear, is taking it to the Uzbeki, who looks like an accountant.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>7.35am:</strong> Some of our top stories now up in the standfirst, there. Bit of a newspapery word, standfirst. You and I can call it, 'slightly washed-out text beneath the headline', if you like.</p> <p>And news of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/15/olympics2008.drugsinsport\">some disqualifications for nasty drug cheats</a>, brought to you with nothing more than the pure blood, sweat and tears of the Guardian team.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>7.38am:</strong> Upstanding fellow and noble Englishman-on-foreign-shores Andrew Jolly is disappointed with the complete lack of 'bring it' being shown by Australian readers. \"Typical, they start off the sledging, fueled by weak beer and sunstroke, but as soon as a couple of Brits slap them around a bit back they go, retreating to the BBQ...\" complains Andy, who likes a sporting contest.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>7.44am: Sotherton watch</strong> It seems that in the confusion and to-and-fro of instantaneous reporting, Kelly did indeed clear 1.83m, but that wasn't quite up there with some of the best. <strong>She's lying in fifth, after the two events so far</strong>, and you can read some proper journalism on the subject <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/15/olympics2008.britisholympicteam1\">here</a>.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>7.48am:</strong> The American with the barmy handle, Hyleas Fountain, is top o'the tree in the heptathlon. Clare Balding loves Kelly Sotherton \"because she's got attitude\". And cos she's such a feisty type, the bods on the BBC couch reckon she'll have been none too pleased about having to wait two hours to have a go on the high jump.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>7.56am:</strong> Brett Badger, who refuses to declare himself as an Australian but probably is, weighs in for the Sheilas: \"l must admit to being a little confused by all this British babble. Perhaps the medal tally l am looking at which shows Australia miles ahead of our Imperial Overlords is wrong?\" [at this point Badger, whose name sounds made up, proffers a link to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics/2008/medals/full\">Guardian medal table</a>, mocking us with our own fancy technology] \"Or am l to understand we are being criticised for not being further ahead of Team GB? OK, l guess that would fit in with the general self flagellating principles of British sport.\" It is customary to let the hare get well out in front before it is overhauled, Brett. In this case by a tortoise on an advanced carbon fibre bicycle.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>8.00am:</strong> While Gary Naylor endures a Kluft-less and therefore Sotherton-less broadcasting landscape in Sweden, I'm stuck with reruns and news segments. Oh, and USA 3-3 Cuba in the baseball. \"With no Kluft-mania to drive the coverage here in Sweden, television has cut away from the Bird's Nest and is now showing Germany vs Sweden in the women's handball,\" laments Gary. \"You wouldn't think it would be possible to make 14 super-fit, Amazonian, European women a-stretching and a-straining dull. But handball manages it.\" To be honest, I'd like to take an objective decision for myself on that one, but not even the internet can help me here (and don't get cheeky...)</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>8.10am: Team GB</strong> Up later, there'll be some rowing, with Zac Purchase and Mark Hunter in the men's lightweight double sculls. The cycling - also known as the basket in which I've placed all my eggs in a verbal spat with Australia - should start in an hour or so, where the Brits will be looking to vanquish the French.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>8.15am:</strong> Andrew Jolly, my partner in crimes against the Australian nation, is beginning to get the wobbles after Brett Badger's robust assault: \"We (the British) are going to look right stupid a bit later on if we all fall off [our bikes]. Actually, as we've talked it up a fair amount, we're going to look right stupid if we don't win 10 gold medals. Not that I'm stepping back towards my BBQ, Agincourt spirit and all that...\" Badger, real name or not, you've certainly brought it.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>8.23am: Team GB athletics</strong> Marilyn Okoro and Jenni Meadows both qualified for the 800m earlier. Not sure we mentioned Marilyn at the time. There's one track gold up for grabs today, but it's not till much later (3.45pm BST).</p> <p>Oh, and in the Amazon-ball, it seems to be Germany 26-27 Sweden... but I'm not really sure how the scoring works. Maybe Gary Naylor can help?</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>8.29am:</strong> News on the baseball from Kyle Hauptman, who has Sydney and Tokyo numbers in his email signature, so I'm going to assume is approximately somewhere in the middle of the Philippines.</p> <p>China 8-7 Chinese Taipei<br>Cuba 5-4 USA</p> <p>The spectre of communism is haunting baseball, then. Or something.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>8.35am:</strong> Almost time for me to chuck in the towel and head home for some kip. Howard Swains will be taking over from me, and he's a stirling chap with a full head of glorious hair. Get ready though, cos some <strong>Brits appear to be out on the lake at Shunyi</strong>...</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>8.43am:</strong> OK, something got lost there in the transition in personnel, but it seems that Britain finished fifth in the lake which, ordinarily, is never good enough to qualify. I'll try to confirm that failure momentarily, but I think we can assume the British pair are out.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>8.47am: Prepared introduction:</strong> Morning again to all, and welcome back to Beijing, being brought to you via a tiny Hitachi screen and an uncertain internet connection channelling an uncertain web-stream. These are the mysteries unravelled.</p> <p>This is the greatest show on earth which, incidentally, is also the name of a song by the rather excellent <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zAioPRKmN4\">Felice Brothers</a> that appeared on my I-Pod this morning. \"I'm in a suit of burgundy/There's a deerhead lookin' at me/It's blowin my mind away.\" That is what it's like at Guardian Towers on day seven of the Olympics. </p> <p>Today's deerhead will be eyeing some canoe/kayaking, some archery, some judo, weightlifting, fencing, shot put, badminton, athletics (where Kelly Sotherton in the heptathlon is the main British attraction) and the chance of some British metal acquisition in the cycling. I haven't so far presided over a single British medal win, but have high hopes for today. The wind has even got up in the right place, offering the prospect of some sailing, and died down elsewhere, permitting some rowing, both of which were postponed yesterday.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://en.beijing2008.cn/\">official Beijing Olympics website</a> sometimes struggles to keep up with what's going on around the whole Games, which can throw us (OK, me) for a loop.</p> <p>Please send in your observations, comments, complaints and typo-spots to <a href=\"mailto:hswains@gmail.com\">hswains@gmail.com</a>.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>8.48am: Unprepared introduction:</strong> Some women rowers have just come fifth in the sculling and have not qualified for the final. \"We gave it our best shot and it's really, really gutting not to reach the final,\" says Helen Casey. Her ship-mate Hester Goodsell is similarly disappointed. \"We're just not quite there yet,\" she says. \"Have a good scull tomorrow,\" pipes up Steve Redgrave.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>8.51am:</strong> Turns out that this telly is actually a Tosumi, not a Hitachi as previously advertised. In the second <strong>sculling</strong> semi-final, Canada beat China who beat Greece.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>8.54am</strong> The British men have just started their semi-final in the double sculls. \"What a fascinating six minutes this will be,\" insists John Inverdale.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>8.58am:</strong> The British pair -- Zac Purchase and Mark Hunter -- are way out in front at the half-way mark, leading the Cubans, Italians and French boats. This one is in the bag.</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>9.02am: Purchase and Hunter cruise into the final of the men's lightweight double sculls</strong> with a comfortable victory in the semi finals. Italy and Cuba come second and third. The final is not for another 48 hours, but there are now very high hopes for gold in the lake. </p> <p>This from table-tennis correspondent Tim Maitland: \"Alan teased us with a mention of the Hong Kong v Chinese Taipei table tennis match, without giving the result or capturing the humungous importance of it. Hong Kong's first medal of the Games! A 3-0 sweep of the-island-otherwise-known-as-Taiwan in the bronze medal match, sealed by Athens-silver-medal-winning legends Li Ching and Ko Lai-Chak in the doubles.\" That's that covered.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>9.03am: Drug cheat news: </strong> North Korean shooter Kim Jong Su has been stripped of his two medals for failing a drugs test. I'm actually not sure how \"new\" this news is, but I hadn't noticed it yet, even though there's an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/feedarticle/7726560\">article being fed onto the Guardian website about it</a>.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>9.10am:</strong> Here are our options for live coverage: Clare Balding in ravishing pink, women's 75kg weightlifting, women's team semi-final table tennis, boxing or sailing. Over to you. (Bear in mind that one email vote would probably win this.)</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>9.16am:</strong> I'm watching some sailing at the moment because there appear to be a British boat involved, skippered (is that the right word?) by Ben Ainslie, who is a definite medal prospect. There's some terrific rhythmic chanting going on courtesy of the Chinese fans on the harbour side, but otherwise I'm at a bit of a loss as to what's really going on. In the rowing lake, Greece beat Denmark beat China in the second lightweight sculls semi-final.</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>9.17am:</strong> Joe Milton wants boxing; Julian Wilson wants Clare Balding in the weightlifting. That's a dead heat, so I'm sticking with the sailing.</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>9.20am:</strong> They've started a 5-minute, 16-boat race in the sailing and deciphering is currently is progress. Meanwhile, the first semi-final of the lightweight fours has just ended in the rowing lake, and Poland won, with Canada and Holland in their slipstream.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>9.22am:</strong> British interests take precedence here, and the men's lightweight fours -- Chambers, Lindsay-Fynn, Mattick and Clarke -- are going in lane two of the rowing lake, against Ireland, Denmark, France, Italy and the USA. Britain are current world champions, so are hotly tipped. And they're off.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>9.26am:</strong> Britain lead. Gary Naylor is in Sweden, and Ranil Dissanayake, who claims to be our most exotically-located reader, being based in Malawi, says \"Boxing! Boxing!\" on the grounds that: \"The skills are all there without any of the queasy liberal guilt of watching the pros maim each other without the protection.\" Hold still, let's get this rowing out the way, and I'll check back on the pugilists.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>9.28am:</strong> Denmark have gone into the lead against Great Britain in the <strong>rowing</strong> after 1,500m. This is only the semi-final, remember, so second is good enough to go through. Ben Ainslie is ahead in his race in the <strong>Finn class sailing</strong>.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>9.30am: Great Britain qualify in third place in the men's lightweight fours. </strong>Denmark win the semi-final, France are second, but the World Champions (that'll be the Brits) are through. Ireland were fourth, and have another chance to qualify in some kind of race off.</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>9.32am: </strong> Dan Smith has the coveted 9.32am update all to himself: \"Can I be the first to mark Team GB's triumphant Government funded march to 2012? We seem to be working with an illustrious combination of reliable bankers (sailing, rowing, cycling), relatively impressive stasis (white water canoeing, 3-day eventing), individual excellence marred by appalling relay error (swimming), slight improvement unnoticed because it's so far down the field (gymnastics) decline (badminton, archery), marked decline (shooting), predicted continued decline (athletics), irreversible decline/abject embarrassing failure (judo), more abject failure (diving), ridiculous hype coupled with abject embarrassing failure at both individual and organisational level (boxing, see Frankie Gavin) and non-qualification (almost everything else).\"</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>9.34am:</strong> At the third mark in the yngling race, the Dutch team are ahead, with the Brits in third. Ben Ainslie, in the Finn class, is \"doing what he does best\" according to the Beeb's enthusiastic boat-bound commentator, who is kind of angular and looks as though he's peering into the back of a spoon.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>9.40am:</strong> Apologies to Irish rowing fans, your boys are out. They get to race in the B final, but can't qualify for the final, as Joanne Harris, a Brit in New Zealand has just emailed to tell me. If anyone knows the point of the B final, please let me know. Meanwhile, the Slovak brothers Pavol and Peter Hochschorner have won gold in the men's canoe doubles. Having improbably enough spent three months in Slovakia last year, I can tell you those Hochschorners are heroes over there.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>9.44am:</strong> They're preparing for action in the velodrome, the second heat of the men's team sprint. Greece go up against Malaysia. Britain are up in heat six. Wow, that was quick. It's all over in just over 44 seconds, with Malaysia winning it.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>9.50am:</strong> China against Japan in heat six in the velodrome, and it's a disaster for Japan, one of those three riders has a problem with his back wheel and drops out right at the start. A puncture, it seems, as a Chinese Wile E. Coyote is seen creeping out of the arena carrying a box of ACME tacks.</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>9.53am:</strong> Thanks again to Joanne Harris for her insight into the rowing. \"And the point of the B final?\" she writes. \"It's about the same as the point of the C and D finals (and E and F, for the singles at these Olympics). It's for FISA (the international rowing federation) placings, so the minor rowing countries know where they've come overall - funding within the countries can depend on it. It's not unimportant, given that 60 nations sent crews to the rowing in Beijing, and occasionally it pays off. Cuba beating Germany is priceless and definitely wouldn't have happened a few years ago.\" Excellent. I genuinely didn't know, so thanks for the info.</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>9.56am:</strong> Australia v Russia in the cycling, and the Aussies take it in 44.335seconds, which is the fastest yet. Russia were seventh fastest so far. The Japanese, meanwhile, didn't get a puncture, but one of their riders' chain snapped, so they'll get another chance. Great Britain are up next. (And, Amy from America and Max from Germany, the Germany/Sweden women's handball finished 27-26 in favour of the Swedes.)</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>10am:</strong> Here it is then: Great Britain share the track with Germany in heat six. Britain are represented here by Chris Hoy, Jason Kenny and Jamie Staff. Staff goes like the wind in the first lap, Kenny takes over for the second, leaving Hoy to <strong>BREAK THE WORLD RECORD!!!</strong></p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>10.02am: GREAT BRITAIN BREAK THE WORLD RECORD IN THE HEATS OF THE TEAM SPRINT</strong>. It's a phenomenal achievement from Jamie Staff, Jason Kenny and Chris Hoy. Staff rides the fastest opening lap of any rider ever and Kenny/Hoy keep the pace to finish in 42.950 seconds. Their previous best was 43.777, so that's extraordinary. France and Holland go head to head in heat seven and the French posted the second-fastest time behind that universe best ever cycling feat by three men on two wheels and a bit of fibreglass EVER!</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>10.07am:</strong> Apparently, this cycling track in Beijing, the Laoshan Velodrome, was always expected to be a fast one, and that world record is not as surprising as it seemed to me (and to the cyclists' mothers, who are all in the crowd and chewing on a British flag like it's a comfort blanky.) Again, over to you lot: how and why is one cycling track faster than another?</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>10.11am:</strong> <strong>Ben Ainslie guaranteed at least silver in Finn class sailing</strong> As all our (my) attention was on the velodrome, Ben Ainslie finished second in his latest race in the Finn class sailing and is now guaranteed at least a silver medal. There are two races left and gold is very much in his sights. If only everyone was either on a bike or a boat. Great Britain would rule the world.</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>10.15am:</strong> Simon Thomas is asking for trouble, or is at least encouraging me to get into trouble: \"Can you don your fashion critic hat for me and describe the plastic suits worn by our cycling heroes? I can't get to a telly so can't see for myself but I'm hoping they've kind of come over all batman on us.\" Well, there are no capes and there are no pointy ears but otherwise, yes.</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>10.20am: </strong>The men's individual pursuit cycling is now underway, and Brett Lancaster of Australia is fastest in the first heat. Steven Burke of the newly-enthused Team GB! GB! GB! goes in the second heat, which is starting .... now!</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>10.25am: </strong> <strong>Steven Burke</strong> trounces his track-mate, the Colombian Alzate, lapping him in fact, and beats his own personal best by nine seconds. <strong>He finishes in 4.22.2, which puts him first from the four who have been out so far</strong>. More wonderful stuff from the British cyclists. Graham Pierce has the skinny on velodromes: \"Beijing is fast mainly because it's new and the surface is clean and blemish free. When velodromes periodically replace the boards speeds always pick up. The angle of banking and tightness of the curves is also a big factor, when the curves are tighter and G forces higher times suffer particularly in the sprint events. This was the case at the world champs in Los Angeles a few years ago. The weather conditions on the day also play a part and generally when it's warmer times are faster. Finally Moscow is known as a really fast track because the aircon system is set up to give the riders a tailwind right the way round the track.\" Is that really true about Moscow? Not that I'm doubting, or anything, but isn't that like installing a huge fan underneath the pole vault run-up, or a motor on the back of a yngling boat?</p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>10.29am:</strong> Another gold medal for Slovakia in the white water singles kayak as Elena Kaliska defends her Olympic championship. They're some canoe/kayakers are the Slovaks and they now move ahead of Team GB! GB! GB! in the medals table. They don't have quite the strength in depth in the cycling or sailing, however. So we'll be back.</p> <!-- Block 103 --> <p><strong>10.35am:</strong> A couple more shiny hyper-links for you to click in the standfirst up there, which will take you through to stories about the cycling world record and Ben Ainslie's sailing antics.</p> <!-- Block 104 --> <p><strong>10.40am:</strong> \"Was that really a world record for the cyclists?\" asks Andrew Jolly, who says that the Australian television coverage has not mentioned it at all. Well, everyone is still reporting that it's a world record, although the usually hyperbolic Press Association have included this caveat in their most recent dispatch: \"There is no world record for the event as the team sprint is held over three laps, regardless of the size of the track.\" They still lead the same piece with the line: \"Britain set up a great chance of winning the first gold medal awarded at the Laoshan Velodrome by qualifying for the first round of the team sprint in unofficial record time.\" So, if the track sizes vary, then there can't be any official world record, it seems. But it stands that the British trio have just recorded the fastest time ever in that event, and you can bet your life that if the Aussies had done it, news of a new world record would be all over the surf club and being shaved into Bouncer's soft labrador fur.</p> <!-- Block 105 --> <p><strong>10.52am: </strong>OK, let's get a grip here. The individual pursuit is underway in the velodrome, with <strong>Bradley Wiggins</strong> up soon. <strong>The British Yngling crew -- Sarah Ayton, Sarah Webb and Pippa Wilson -- have now guaranteed at least bronze</strong> in their sailing class, and still have an outside chance of gold. Roger Federer's vanquisher James Blake is into a final set against Fernando Gonzalez in the tennis; Brazil are about to play Norway in the quarter finals of the women's football, and much, much more. </p> <p>There's a lot of AAARRGGHHing coming my way from Alex Pace, who is watching the cycling in Australia. \"AAAARGGGHHHH,\" he aaarghhhs. \"In Australia, they are only showing the Aussie cyclists but even worse hey have put some ignorant Aussie buffoon in the commentary box with the commentating legend that is Phil Liggett, his sole purpose seems to be to interrupt, contradict and irritate the silver-tongued Liggett with observations about how BLOODY GREAT the Australian cyclists are. AAAAARGHHHHH.\"</p> <!-- Block 106 --> <p><strong>10.59am: </strong>\"An under-ripe banana is as bad for you as a biscuit,\" says the commentator on the tennis. I'm not sure who it is, but she follows up with: \"There's all sorts of banana analysis that's been done.\" Flicking through these internet streams is a lot like listening to snippets of conversations on the tube or something. There's probably some context, but it's usually missed. I'm not sure what Gary Naylor is on about here, either, but it's always good to have him: \"Can anyone confirm if the crowd in Olympic velodrome has adopted the same practices as the crowds in the Belgian Six Day events - specifically, smoking, boozing and eating chips with mayonnaise? Possibly not, I suspect.\" And Roger Cook is thinking of shaving the world record cycling time in to his cats, photographs of which would persuade me to learn how to embed images into this minute-by-minute sports coverage tool to share with the world.</p> <!-- Block 107 --> <p><strong>11.07am:</strong> <strong>Bradley Wiggins </strong>is on the track in the final heat of the individual pursuit. Steven Burke is still leading, I think, although Wiggins is da man. More on the is-it-isn't-it a world record in the team sprint comes courtesy of Simon Carmouche: \"Most but not all tracks are 250m, so it's not meaningless even though not official.\" Not meaningless, if not official. Is it wrong to adopt that as a life ambition?</p> <!-- Block 108 --> <p><strong>11.10am:</strong> <strong>Bradley Wiggins eases to the fastest qualifying time in the individual pursuit, and sets a new Olympic record to boot.</strong> The time is 4.15.031. And he'll lead the New Zealander Haydn Rolleston when they reconvene.</p> <!-- Block 109 --> <p><strong>11.13am:</strong> Wiggins was awesome there, and is a clear favourite for gold. Rolleston was second-fastest, then Markov, Dyadnya and then Steven Burke. Steven Gagola, who's pretty sharp on the old email, is angry: \"Your lack of info annoys me. So the British Yngling crew are<br>guaranteed a bronze! Where are they on the current standings and where<br>did they finish today?\" Sorry about that Steven, it did kind of creep up on us. They finished fifth in today's race 8, but still lead the overall standings, which look like this: 1 Gr Britain 22.0 pts, 2 Netherlands 23.0 pts, 3 Greece 42.0 pts, 4 United States 43.0 pts, 5 France 46.0 pts, 6 Russian Feder 46.0 pts, 7 China 47.0 pts, 8 Australia 49.0 pts, 9 Germany 52.0 pts, 10 Norway 57.0 pts, 11 Finland 60.0 pts, 12 S Africa 63.0 pts, 13 Canada 66.0 pts, 14 Spain 67.0 pts, 15 Italy 74.0 pts.</p> <!-- Block 110 --> <p><strong>11.17am:</strong> The team pursuit semi-finals (or second round) are underway. I missed the first one -- these really do fly by -- but I understand that Australia won it, but that Germany recorded a faster time in the second. The British world record holders* are out soon. (*Not an official world record), but first we have Malaysia and France.</p> <!-- Block 111 --> <p><strong>11.22am: </strong>The division of labour here in Guardian Towers is severely imbalanced. The entire media desk behind me are riveted by television coverage of a penguin being knighted at Edinburgh zoo by the Norwegian army. You. Couldn't. Make. It. Up. France won that team sprint against the Malaysians, and the French are quickest so far, from Germany and Australia.</p> <!-- Block 112 --> <p><strong>11.24am:</strong> Team GB! GB! GB!'s (unofficial) World Record holders are on the track. They're up against the United States. Here they go...</p> <!-- Block 113 --> <p><strong>11.24 and 43.034 seconds am:</strong> Another superlative effort from Staff, Kenny and Hoy who, in that order, have taken the Brits through to the final to face France in the final of the team sprint. The bronze medal ride off will be between Germany and Australia.</p> <!-- Block 114 --> <p><strong>11.26am: GB through to final in team sprint</strong>. Jamie Staff, Jason Kenny and Chris Hoy will ride for the gold medal against France, a repeat of the World Championship final. Australia and Germany will contest the bronze, which will no doubt please Cameron McCallum, who I suspect is from Down Under: \"Just wondering why you're getting so excited about about a guaranteed bronze,\" says McCallum, mistaking this line \"<strong>The British Yngling crew -- Sarah Ayton, Sarah Webb and Pippa Wilson -- have now guaranteed at least bronze</strong>\" for excitement. \"That wouldn't even make the news in Australia. You can have a couple of ours for a while if it makes you feel better.\" Are they yours to give away Cameron?</p> <!-- Block 115 --> <p><strong>11.34am:</strong> Some talking up, and some dressing down: \"Short of falling off, Brad Wiggins and the team sprinters must have golds in the bag. Or is that hubris?\" says Ga Naylor, obviously friendly enough with Mr Wiggins to drop the \"ley\". For what it's worth, yes it's hubris, but let's hope it's not misplaced. Meanwhile Tim Chadderton and Paul McMillan are right to say I understated the Yngling team's chance of gold. They lead after eight races, so have it all to lose. Which, as it happens, etc., and so forth.</p> <!-- Block 116 --> <p><strong>11.38am: </strong>I can't say I'm all that keen on this, but my inbox is positively groaning from emails from you lot asking me to stick it to the Aussies. \"After tomorrow, we shan't need Cameron McCallum's hand outs, as I believe we will be above the Aussies in the medal table,\" says Richard Alderson, whose comments are fairly representative. Meanwhile the news wires report that Australian cyclists Brad McGee and Brett Lancaster are out of the individual pursuit, the event in which nice and British Bradley Wiggins seems nailed on for gold, and David Hopkins provides a link to an <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,24174888-5012768,00.html\">Australian newspaper story which details a Hong Kong man's attempt to have sex with a park bench</a>. (Warning, link goes to story in an Australian newspaper about a Hong Kong man attempting to have sex with a park bench. With video of the rescue.)</p> <!-- Block 117 --> <p><strong>11.46am:</strong> Claire Wright speaks for a lot of us here, but has made a mistake in thinking we can clear it up: \"So Bradley Wiggins can set a new Olympic record (11.10am), but (10.02am) the team sprint can't set a new world record. Did Wiggins cycle a set distance rather than number of laps so the length of track (11.07am comment) doesn't matter?\" I really, really don't know. The television coverage definitely flashed up \"Olympic record\" for Wiggins, and also flashed up the same for the team sprint. It didn't, thinking about it now, flash up \"World record\", however. Official/unofficial, Olympic/World. Who cares, huh? GB! GB! GB!</p> <!-- Block 118 --> <p><strong>11.53am: </strong>Roget Federer's vanquisher James Blake and Fernando Gonzalez are involved in a titanic battle on the tennis court. It's eight games all in the final set (of three) with no tie-break in sight. I actually wrote about this earlier, but those computer gremlins seem to have deleted it. This happens a lot.</p> <!-- Block 119 --> <p><strong>11.55am: </strong>The velodrome is now hosting the women's 3,000m individual pursuit, in which GB! GB! GB! is represented Wendy Houvenaghel and Rebecca Romero (if the British Olympic team website is correct, which I hope it is). \"In disciplines like the team sprint where the event can be raced over non-standard tracks (thus the distance can vary) the terminology for the British team's achievement is \"world best\",\" asserts John Ogmore, and earns my gratitude. \"On events like the 4000m pursuit the fixed distance allows it to be called a world record no matter which track it is ridden on.\" Thanks to all, who said much the same thing.</p> <!-- Block 120 --> <p><strong>12pm:</strong> Houvenaghel has started her individual pursuit and is in pursuit of/being pursued by the American cyclist Sarah Hammer. The Brit is a second ahead after 2km.</p> <!-- Block 121 --> <p><strong>12.05pm: Wendy Houvenaghel sets a personal best of 3mins28.443secs in the 3,000m individual pursuit, the fastest time after five heats. </strong>Rebecca Romero is next up, against Katie Mactier, of Australia.</p> <!-- Block 122 --> <p><strong>12.08pm</strong> Fernando Gonzalez has broken James Blake's serve and is now serving for the match at 10-9 in the final set. Meanwhile Rebecca Romero trounced her Aussie opponent in the individual pursuit and is the second fastest qualifier, behind her team-mate Wendy Houvenaghel. Have some bold text: <strong>Wendy Houvenaghel and Rebecca Romero qualify first and second fastest in the women's 3,000m individual pursuit.</strong></p> <!-- Block 123 --> <p><strong>12.11pm:</strong> Are you watching Cameron McCullum? If so, you've just seen your country miss out on third place in the men's team sprint, as Germany edged it on the line to take the bronze medal race. It's the final next, between France and GB! GB! GB!</p> <!-- Block 124 --> <p><strong>12.15pm: GB! GB! GB! win GOLD in men's team sprint</strong> Terrific stuff from the British cycling team, who set a world best in the heat, cruised through the semi and have now completed the gold medal charge by thrashing the French team, who take silver. Delirious scenes. GB! GB! GB!</p> <!-- Block 125 --> <p><strong>12.20pm:</strong> Jamie Staff, Jason Kenny and Chris Hoy will soon be on the podium with a big chunk of gold around their neck. Staff was characteristically exceptional in the first leg, Kenny kept the pace over the second and Hoy anchored it perfectly. Gonzalez beat Blake in the tennis, by the way.</p> <!-- Block 126 --> <p><strong>12.27pm:</strong> Over to the National Stadium, Beijing, for the heats of the men's 1,500m. Andy Baddeley goes in one of these heats for GB! GB! GB! and has the British commentators all afluster. In the tennis, Gonzalez will play either Novak Djokovic or Rafael Nadal in the final. Their semi takes place later today. \"Is Cameron McCullum's e-mail the most ill-timed piece of jingoistic tub-thumping, or was it simply the dawning realisation that he is fast running out of time to make such a comment?\" asks Robert Hill. Timing, as any comedian will tell you, is 90 percent perspiration.</p> <!-- Block 127 --> <p><strong>12.30pm:</strong> Tom Lancashire, the British \"hope\" in the second heat of the men's 1,500m finishes out of the qualification places in seventh. A 19-year-old Kenyan, whose name is on the tip of my fingers, wins it.</p> <!-- Block 128 --> <p><strong>12.37pm:</strong> Andy Baddely leaves it late but looks comfortable in the third heat of the 1,500m to qualify. He sits at the back of the pack for the first couple of laps, which frightens Bredan Foster in the commentary box, but edges forward through the final 600m and comes good on the back straight, where he is forced wide but has the savvy to get into the first few across the line. Five qualify and he's safely through in fourth. \"I..puff...thought...puff...it...puff...was...puff...bang...on,\" says Baddely himself.</p> <!-- Block 129 --> <p><strong>12.40pm</strong> The heptathletes are back in town and that means Kelly Sotherton. Her first put in the shot put goes 13.87m which is \"solid enough\" according to someone who knows more than me. Just previously, Anna Bogdanova put one 14.04, which is presumably more solid.</p> <!-- Block 130 --> <p><strong>12.46pm:</strong> \"I've never heard of this \"on the tip of my fingers' guy,\" zings Chris Riley. \"What's his previous form?\" Don't know about other events, but he seems to win a lot when I'm on M-B-M duty. I still can't actually find out the winners of those 1,500m heats, but assume they'll be filtering onto <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics/2008/events/aug/15\">our results page</a> soon-ish.</p> <!-- Block 131 --> <p><strong>12.53pm:</strong> It's the men's 100m second round now, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/15/olympics2008.olympicsathletics3\">Gay, Powell and Bolt are all comfortably through from the first round.</a> Simeon Williamson, who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2008/aug/05/simeon.williamson.olympics.beijing\">previously boasted that he's a medal prospect</a>, is in the first race. And he's out. He finished fourth, with the top three qualifying, who were: Churandy Martina, from Michael Frater and Naoki Tsukahara. Williamson is \"going back to the drawing room\" according to his post-race interview.</p> <!-- Block 132 --> <p><strong>1pm:</strong> Tyson Gay goes in the second round two race. Metre-by-metre coverage has proven to be just a pipe dream, incidentally. There's a false start before they finally get away and Richard Thompson from Trinidad and Tobago wins it in 9.99, after a slow start. Gay is comfortably through in second, but looked a touch rusty. He'll need to improve.</p> <!-- Block 133 --> <p><strong>1.03pm: </strong>\"This \"on the tips of my fingers\" implies that you are actually typing this,\" says Simon Martin. \"This is a revelation. I previously pictured you lot sunk into a big armchair in front of a large TV barking dictation to some poor sod on minimum wage.\" That, Simon, is over-by-over cricket coverage you're talking about. \"Toss another typo in the mix, intern. Keep them on their toes.\"</p> <!-- Block 134 --> <p><strong>1.07pm:</strong> Another false start in the third round-two 100m race allows some football updates or, more precisely, a solitary football update. the Brazilian women are through to the final after beating Norway 2-1. Dinara Safina has taken the first set off Jelena Jankovic in the women's tennis semi-final.</p> <!-- Block 135 --> <p><strong>1.09pm:</strong> <strong>GB! GB! GB!'s Tyrone Edgar finishes third in his second-round heat of the 100m in 10.10 and goes through to tomorrow's semi final.</strong> Marc Burns wins it, Kim Collins is second and they both qualify alongside Edgar.</p> <!-- Block 136 --> <p><strong>1.11pm: </strong>Tempted as I am to fill this MBM with the non-stop barrage of anti-Australian sentiment that is pouring into my inbox, I <em>do</em> want to get served in the bars of Earls Court next time I go there, so I'm going to have to omit most of it. Andrew Jolly, Alex Pace and Chris Bridge, are suffering at the hands of the Australian broadcasters, meanwhile, and have been forced to watch handball and gymnastics repeats instead of the British cycling win. Bridge offers: \"If two slugs were crawling up a wall and one was painted green and gold it would make the news here.\"</p> <!-- Block 137 --> <p><strong>1.15pm: </strong>That is absolutely extraordinary. Usain Bolt has just <em>jogged</em> to victory in the fourth 100m second-round heat, running 9.92secs without even breaking sweat. \"How much is still in the engine?\" asks the track-side commentator. \"A lot,\" Bolt replies. It really was amazing: he hardly seemed to strain <em>at all</em> and yet won by a mile. Craig Pickering, of GB! GB! GB! finished back in sixth in 10.18 and does not qualify. \"I'm gutted,\" says Pickering. \"Congratulations,\" says the interviewer, inappropriately.</p> <!-- Block 138 --> <p><strong>1.20pm:</strong> Asafa Powell also ambles into tomorrow's semi-finals, winning his heat in 10.02 but no less comfortably than Bolt. Walter Dix, of the United States, is second and Derrick Atkins third. There are no Brits. Pay attention to John Davis: \"Ease up on the pre-emptive gloating with the Aussies eh? Remember that we are British and that the order of the Universe requires that the wheels fall off (probably literally) our gold medal charge soon.\"</p> <!-- Block 139 --> <p><strong>1.26pm:</strong> Replays of the <strong>Usain Bolt</strong> run are now on repeat on the telly, and rightly so. \"What am I supposed to say?\" says Michael Johnson, who is paid to say something in the BBC commentary box. \"We're pretty much guaranteed a world record in the 100 metres,\" he adds. Kelly Sotherton holds onto fifth place in the heptathlon after the shot put, although her best throw was way short of her personal best, and Nataliia Dobrynska broke the record for a heptathlete in that event and leapt up to second in the leaderboard.</p> <!-- Block 140 --> <p><strong>1.32pm: </strong>Turns out -- as many of you have pointed out -- that I understated the extent of the <strong>Yngling</strong> team's achievement earlier. The always-accurate television is confidently declaring that they're set for at least silver and not at least bronze, as previously reported. They're one point ahead of the Holland crew and simply need to finish in front of the Dutch to win.</p> <!-- Block 141 --> <p><strong>1.35pm:</strong> As the BBC show footage of three tearful British <strong>cyclists</strong> -- Messrs Staff, Kelly and Hoy -- receiving their gold medals for team sprint triumph, news reaches that a French team -- presumably Messrs Porthos, Athos and Aramis -- has won the men's <strong>epee</strong> competition, catapulting France ahead of Britain in the medal table.</p> <p>\"Forget the negativity - talk it up!\" booms Richard Greaves, who actually just wants to tell us that he's going to the Games tomorrow. \"There are plenty more medals to come from our velodrome boys and girls (well there had better be, I'm going tomorrow night and Monday).\"</p> <!-- Block 142 --> <p><strong>1.45pm:</strong> Back to the Bird's Nest stadium, where Helen Clitheroe goes in the heats of the <strong>3,000m steeplechase</strong>, an event making its Olympic debut in Beijing (the women's version, at least). They're not talking up her chances, mind you, with ten of the field having run faster than Clitheroe's personal best.</p> <!-- Block 143 --> <p><strong>1.49pm</strong> Here's something about the steeplechase I've just learned from Wikipedia (which is the sole reason that A Level pass rates continue to rise, in my opinion. Wikipedia, not the steeplechase): \"The event originated in the British Isles. Runners raced from one town's steeple to the next. The steeples were used as markers due to their visibility over long distances. Along the way runners inevitably had to jump creeks and low stone walls separating estates.\" I like the use of the word \"inevitably\" there, as if there aren't two steeples in the entire land without a couple of creeks and stone walls between them. Clitheroe is going great guns, by the way, and is on course for a British record.</p> <!-- Block 144 --> <p><strong>1.52pm</strong> <strong>Helen Clitheroe finishes sixth in the 3,000m steeplechase</strong>. It's probably not good enough to qualify (top four go through, plus a couple of fastest losers from three races), but it's a massive personal best, 10 seconds better than she's ever run before, a British record, and we'll give her a big Team GB! GB! GB! pat on the back for that.</p> <!-- Block 145 --> <p><strong>1.57pm:</strong> \"Your etymology of steeplechase is interesting, but refers to the horseback version I feel. I know this because of pictures on biscuit tins.\" Nope, Gary Naylor, nope. You and your biscuit tins can <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steeplechase_%28athletics%29\">eat this link</a> which takes you to the athletics disambiguation of steeplechase. In another heat, incidentally, there was a huge pile up over the water jump and I suspect some photographers will have got it. Check out our <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2008/aug/11/olympics20081?picture=336621666\">weird Olympic photos gallery</a>, where I expect it to appear overnight.</p> <!-- Block 146 --> <p><strong>2.08pm: </strong>More steeplechase news and it's of the \"agonising\" variety for Team GB and brave Helen Clitheroe in particular. Despite fearing her run wouldn't be good enough, she was given massive hope throughout the final heat when she seemed set to go through as one of the three fastest losers. But at the last minute, an Italian athlete just pipped her and it will be her to who will have to do all that running between the Beijing steeples over creeks and walls again on Sunday. Hard luck Helen.</p> <!-- Block 147 --> <p><strong>2.10pm:</strong> Humliating backtrack here: Gary Naylor was right about the steeplechase. He usually is right. The athletics took its name from the horse race, where the horses were jumping over walls and creeks and not brave athletes named after towns in Lancashire. Sorry Gary. Back to the action, Great Britain are playing South Africa in the hockey and David Davies has made it to the final of the 1,500m freestyle. Grant Hacket, going for his third gold in a row in this event, broke the Olympic record in qualifying fastest.</p> <!-- Block 148 --> <p><strong>2.18pm: </strong>I've had a quick scout around for the latest hockey tables but can't seem to find them, although I remember that Great Britain essentially need to win all their remaining games to have a chance of going through to the medal play-offs. It's 0-0 with 21 minutes left in the first half.</p> <!-- Block 149 --> <p><strong>2.21pm:</strong> Lu Yong wins China's eighth weightlifting gold medal, and the world record to boot. Andrei Rybakou, of Belarus lifted the same weight in the men's 85-kg class, which was a world record, but Lu weighs less and so took the gold.</p> <!-- Block 150 --> <p><strong>2.27pm: </strong>Excellent goal for Great Britain in the hockey, courtesy of James Tindall. A South African player totally missed an attempted interception of a pass in the middle of the pitch and Tindall was clean through on goal. The keeper advanced, but Tindall casually lifted it over him and into the net. Team GB lead 1-0.</p> <!-- Block 151 --> <p><strong>2.36pm:</strong> Quick round-up: Team GB's <strong>Paul Goodison</strong> is joint leader in the men's <strong>laser</strong> (that's sailing, by the way.) He won race four, and the current top three are: 1. Paul Goodison (Britain) 33, 2. Rasmus Myrgren (Sweden) 33, 3. Igor Lisovenko (Russia) 37. <strong>Penny Clark</strong> wasn't quite so good in the women's race and finished 10th in the fourth radial. Japan lead China 1-0 in the first-half of the women's <strong>football</strong> semi-final, where the winners play Brazil. Jelena Jankovic is 4-2 down to Dinara Safina in the <strong>tennis</strong> semi-final. The British women's 100m medley team are into the final, qualifying second fastest behind the Australians, as are the men, who qualified fifth fastest, behind, well, just behind.</p> <!-- Block 152 --> <p><strong>2.38pm: </strong>The 200m is the final event today in the heptathlon, and Kelly Sotherton, lying fifth overall, is in lane three in heat two. She'll be off momentarily.</p> <!-- Block 153 --> <p><strong>2.40pm</strong> Excellent run for Sotherton, who finishes second in her heat in a time of 23.39, which is her personal best. That means 1,040 points, but what that means to the overall standings remains to be seen. Sotherton had a decent day on the track, but blew it in the high jump and shot put. \"I'm gutted,\" said Sotherton, using the buzz word of Team GB! GB! GB! today.</p> <!-- Block 154 --> <p><strong>2.44pm:</strong> Natalia Dobrynska, of Ukraine, wins her heat of the heptathlon 200m and does so wearing a \"leader\" badge, a new innovation here that is kind of like the yellow jersey in the Tour de France. GB's Julie Hollman is back in seventh or eighth. Full standings at the end of the first day to follow.</p> <!-- Block 155 --> <p><strong>2.47pm:</strong> Britain's top discus thrower, Philippa Roles, just misses out on a place in the final. She wangs it 57.44m, but it's not far enough and she ends 16th. The men's shot put final is underway, at the same time as the final heat of the 200m of the heptathlon. After that, we should have the overall standings that will show us where Sotherton is.</p> <!-- Block 156 --> <p><strong>2.53pm:</strong> Dinara Safina has just successfully served for the match against Jelena Jankovic and goes through to the semi-final. Contrary to previous reports, that was the quarter-final and she'll now play China's Li Na in the semi. There are three Russians already in the semis, but Jankovic, the world No1 is out.</p> <!-- Block 157 --> <p><strong>2.54pm:</strong> Tom Bryant is coming in for the coming ten minutes or so, and I'll leave you with news that Kelly Sotherton is up to third in the heptathlon rankings at the end of the first day. Hyleas Fountain leads with 4060, Natalia Dobrynska is second with 3996 and Sotherton third with 3938, but probably won't be happy after a couple of poor events. Anyway, here's Tom.</p> <!-- Block 158 --> <p><strong>3pm:</strong> The men are still doing their thing with their sticks in the hockey and they're still 1-0 up against the South Africans, so jolly good for them. On the track, meanwhile, they're lining up for the men's 400m hurdles heat - which has always struck me as a particularly tricky race to run.</p> <!-- Block 159 --> <p><strong>3.04pm:</strong> The favourite Bershawn Jackson wins it in 49.20 but, even better is the bloke who comes in last. Not sure who he is yet but he came in what must have felt like three days behind the winner. Brilliant stuff, that's what all that training was for. Ah - it was Harouna Garba from Nigeria. See ya!</p> <!-- Block 160 --> <p><strong>3.08pm:</strong> Over in the shot put, it looks like a ZZ Top roadie's convention as a succession of bearded, muscle-bound men compete in what I'd argue is one of the more bizarre track and field events. I can see the point, in an evolutionary sense, of virtually everything else - the javelin was useful for hunting, the running useful for chasing or being chased, the long-jump useful for jumping over things etc. However the point of hurling a large ball as fas as possible? It eludes me. Same for the discus, obviously.</p> <!-- Block 161 --> <p><strong>3.11pm:</strong>Just past halftime in the big women's football semi-final grudge match* between China and Japan, the Japanese are winning 1-0. Currently there are a lot of people lying flat on their backs looking winded. </p> <p><em>* May not actually be a grudge match, reporter groundlessly basing comments on the fact that the two countries are quite close to each other and very little else.</em></p> <!-- Block 162 --> <p><strong>3.13pm:</strong> And with after fact-less reporting, I'll let Howard take back over.</p> <!-- Block 163 --> <p><strong>3.15pm</strong>: \"We are up here TV-less and PC-less, and the New York Times site says Germany has eight golds so far (with no detail), while the Guardian site sticks to 7. Which is right?\" pleads Amy Hordes. Well, last week the NY Times apparently printed a correction from an article written in the mid 1960s, and are the noted arbiters of journalistic accuracy worldwide. I previously not only quoted from Wikipedia, but actually <em>mis</em>applied that baseless \"fact\". You take a guess.</p> <!-- Block 164 --> <p><strong>3.20pm:</strong> Somewhere at the Greatest Show on Earth, Rafael Nadal, arguably the greatest athlete in the world at the moment (Usain Bolt possibly excepted) is playing Novak Djokovic, arguably the greatest Serbian tennis player/impressionist combo in the world. But I can't find any evidence of it on the gogglebox on even the various internet streams, so can't really tell you anything about it. But The Polish ZZ Top roadie has won the shot put, it seems.</p> <!-- Block 165 --> <p><strong>3.24pm:</strong> Roger Cook has the investigative nose of his journalistic namesake: \"If Amy Hordes is TV-less and PC-less, how does she know what the NYT site says (or the Guardian for that matter) and how is she emailing you?\" Good questions, and I'll send the intern to the telex machine straight away to pick up her answer. That Polish shot putter is named Tomasz Majewsky, by the way, and he's taken gold ahead of the American Christian Cantwell.</p> <!-- Block 166 --> <p><strong>3.29pm: </strong>Great Britain have beaten South Africa 2-0 in the men's hockey and stay in with a chance of qualification for the medal matches. It's a fairly big ask - they'll have to beat Australia - but Matt Daley's late goal, added to James Tindall's first-half strike, give them a crucial victory in this match.</p> <!-- Block 167 --> <p><strong>3.32pm: </strong>You leave Tom Bryant in charge of a MBM for ten minutes and he starts a diplomatic incident. Regarding his \"throwaway\" comment that the China-Japan football match might be a grudge match, we have opened up a huge can of military worms: \"Yes, China v Japan most certainly is a grudge match, given added spice by the fact that today is the anniversary of Japan's defeat in WWII,\" explains John Senior. \"The Chinese, as usual, are playing what might be politely described as a robust physical game. Hopefully their fans won't follow suit and pelt the Japanese embassy with eggs and stones, like at the Asian Cup a few years ago.\"</p> <!-- Block 168 --> <p><strong>3.35pm:</strong> The line-up for the semi-finals of the men's 400m hurdles have been decided and there are no members of Team GB! GB! GB! in them, so we can happily pretend the event doesn't exist. \"Yep, grudge match seems fair given Manchuria, Nanking, Japan's continued inability to apologise for war crimes and Chinese support for North Korea and its missile testing in the area,\" intones Anthony O'Keefe.</p> <!-- Block 169 --> <p><strong>3.39pm:</strong> Ker-rash goes my computer. \"I'm watching the tennis live on Malaysian TV in Kuala Lumpur,\" writess Simon Price. \"Nadal has just broken forthree two in the first set.\" Ta.</p> <!-- Block 170 --> <p><strong>3.46pm:</strong> Simon Price's email footer claims he's an executive director of a building communications company in Kuala Lumpur. But today he's moonlighting as a MBM correspondent, watching the tennis: \"Djokovic double faults to go 5:2 down. Nadal serving for the first set. He's killing him.\"</p> <!-- Block 171 --> <p><strong>3.47pm</strong> Meanwhile, John Senior is watching the football, so I don't have to: \"Excellent second goal by Japan. A neat one-two through a crowd on the edge of the box left several Chinese defenders sprawled in a heap as<br>the ball was slotted past the keeper. They'll be boarding up the<br>windows at the Japanese embassy in Beijing about now, I should think.\" A joke too. I never realised how easy this could be. Anyone watching the weightlifting?</p> <!-- Block 172 --> <p><strong>3.48pm:</strong> Joe Milton is concerned for our well-being: \"Are you continuing the MBM over the weekend?\" he asks. \"If so are feeling slightly bitter about it being that hardly anyone will be at work and therefore will be watching on TV or using websites instead of following your commentary?\" Yep, there'll still be full text commentary - in for a penny, etc. But on your second point, you'd be amazed. There are some folk who read this <em>while</em> they're also watching it on TV. Lord knows why, but it's true. Anyway, the women's 10,000m final is underway in the Bird's Nest.</p> <!-- Block 173 --> <p><strong>3.52pm: </strong>And finally the tennis appears on my screen, so Simon Price, you can now go to bed if you want to. Djokovic broke back against Nadal, but the Spaniard is still serving for the set at 5-4.</p> <!-- Block 174 --> <p><strong>3.55pm</strong> This straight from the news-wires: Women's doubles Final: 1 DU Jing &amp; Wei Yili &amp; Yang Wei &amp; Yu Yang &amp; Zhang Jiewen &amp; Zhang Yawen (Chn), 2 Jungeun Ha &amp; Minjung Kim &amp; Hyojung Lee &amp; Kyungwon Lee (Kor), 3 DU Jing &amp; Wei Yili &amp; Yang Wei &amp; Yu Yang &amp; Zhang Jiewen &amp; Zhang Yawen (Chn), 4 Miyuki Maeda &amp; Kumiko Ogura &amp; Reiko Shiota &amp; Satoko Suetsuna (Jpn), Tania Luiz &amp; Eugenia Tanaka (Aus), DU Jing &amp; Wei Yili &amp; Yang Wei &amp; Yu Yang &amp; Zhang Jiewen &amp; Zhang Yawen (Chn), Wen-Hsing Cheng &amp; Yu-Chin Chien (Tpe), Kamilla Rytter Juhl &amp; Lena Frier Kristiansen (Den), Gail Emms &amp; Donna Kellogg (Gbr), Liliyana &amp; Vita Marissa (Ina), Miyuki Maeda &amp; Kumiko Ogura &amp; Reiko Shiota &amp; Satoko Suetsuna (Jpn), Jungeun Ha &amp; Minjung Kim &amp; Hyojung Lee &amp; Kyungwon Lee (Kor), Eei Hui Chin &amp; Pei Tty Wong (Mal), Chantal Botts &amp; Michelle Edwards (Rsa), Yanmei Jiang &amp; Yujia Li (Sin), Eva Lee &amp; Mesinee Mangkalakiri (USA)</p> <!-- Block 175 --> <p><strong>3.56pm</strong> Nadal wins the first set 6-4. That garbled stuff below was my attempt to find out who won the women's doubles badminton, and I think this says it better: DU &amp; Yu (Chn) bt Lee &amp; Lee (Kor) 2-0; (21-15), (21-13) , so that's another gold for the home nation.</p> <!-- Block 176 --> <p><strong>3.59pm:</strong> \"There's a 'Racket of God' controversy brewing in the tennis,\" says Kevin Davies, and he's right, although he's maybe overstating it. \"Near the end of the Blake-Gonzalez match, NBC showed Blake losing a critical point after his shot fell out. It clearly grazed Gonzalez' racket, but the Chilean didn't acknowledge the touch. Blake tried showing restraint but bemoaned lack of Olympic spirit in the press conference.\" The TV commentators are on about this as well at the moment. Apparently Gonzalez should have called the foul on himself, but didn't, and Blake didn't win another game after the incident. This should give the noted moodster Blake something to whinge about for the coming few months.</p> <!-- Block 177 --> <p><strong>4.02pm:</strong> They're 14 minutes into the women's 10,000m, and GB's Jo Pavey is in about 16th place and \"running very wisely\" according to Brendon Foster. Holland's Lornah Kiplagat is out front.</p> <!-- Block 178 --> <p><strong>4.09pm:</strong> Kiplagat still leads with 11 laps to go, with Mestawet Tufa, of Ethiopia, second. Jo Pavey is beginning to struggle, especially compared with the casualness of the leaders. Pavey is out of the leading group now and is going to find it hard to get back into this.</p> <!-- Block 179 --> <p><strong>4.12pm: </strong>Elvan Abeylegesse, of Turkey, is the new, mightily inconvenient leader for anyone typing this up. Tirunesh Dibaba, from Ethiopia, is second and Britain's Jo Pavey has fallen off the back of the earth.</p> <!-- Block 180 --> <p><strong>4.16pm:</strong> Abeylegesse still leads a strung-out group five, from Dibaba. Dibaba remains an Ethiopian, the nation that Abeylegasse left for Turkey. And it's definitely just between these two now as they move well clear of the rest of the field. Jo Pavey has now slipped off of even Brendan Foster's radar.</p> <!-- Block 181 --> <p><strong>4.20pm: </strong>Novak Djokovic has broken Nadal in the second set of the men's semi-finals and leads 3-1. Abeylgesse and Dibaba are still going this alone, with both looking totally at ease, but Dibaba sitting threateningly on Abeylgesse's shoulder. Shalane Flanagan has moved into third spot for the United States.</p> <!-- Block 182 --> <p><strong>4.22pm:</strong> <em>That's</em> how you win a <strong>10,000m </strong>race. At the bell, <strong>Tirunesh Dibaba</strong> explodes past Abeylgesse and flies into the lead. She sprints for the final 400m at a phenomenal rate and no one can get close. Abeylgesse keeps second and Flanagan takes third for the United States. \"That's not the result she would have wanted,\" says Steve Cram in the commentary box, as Jo Pavey comes in 412th from a field of 32. Dibaba's time was 29:54.68, which is one of the fastest times ever, despite smog, heat, etc., and so forth.</p> <!-- Block 183 --> <p><strong>4.26pm:</strong> Novak Djokovic leads 4-1 in the second set, but is one set down to Rafael Nadal. I'm busily trying to find someone to take over this to see you to the end of the tennis.</p> <!-- Block 184 --> <p><strong>4.28pm:</strong> With a repeated punch to his own chest, Novak Djokovic breaks Nadal again to lead 5-1 in the second set. Looks like this one's going to a decider. Meanwhile, Jo Pavey asks \"What can you do?\" in her post-race interview and Kate Reed, whose was running in her first ever 10,000m final and didn't even appear in the commentary until it was done, also has a brief, sweaty chat. Not the results the British athletes will have been looking for, but a decent race nonetheless.</p> <!-- Block 185 --> <p><strong>4.33pm: </strong>OK, Pavey actually finished in 12th spot and Kate Reed 23rd. Djokovic levels the tennis and that goes to a decider, while Caroline Kluft doesn't qualify for the triple jump final. That's it from me. I'm off, but a full report from the tennis will follow. Full coverage continues over the weekend. Thanks for your emails. Bye.</p>"
