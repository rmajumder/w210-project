  "<p>European ministers will meet today in Brussels to discuss the renewable energy directive, a ground-breaking piece of legislation that could kick-start the energy revolution we desperately need to tackle the dual challenges of climate change and energy insecurity. However, rather than wholeheartedly supporting this green energy plan, the UK has until now worked behind the scenes to seriously undermine the agreement - for example by omitting energy from aviation when calculating the renewable energy targets.</p> <p>We hope the creation of a Department of Energy and Climate Change signals a change in direction. We call on the government to support the directive and get behind building a thriving renewable energy industry in the UK that will not only help cut climate change emissions, but also generate millions of pounds worth of investment, hundreds of thousands of jobs and a secure energy supply. </p> <p>As one of the major contributors to the climate change problem, the UK should lead the way in tackling it - both for our own benefit and the benefit of the world's poorest people who will suffer first and worst as temperatures rise. </p> <p>Gordon Brown promised he would generate 15% of our energy from UK renewables by 2020. The prime minister needs to demonstrate that this is a promise he intends to keep, with every sector of the economy playing its part.<br><strong>Daleep Mukarji </strong>Director, Christian Aid, <strong>Andy Atkins </strong>Executive director, Friends of the Earth, <strong>John Sauven </strong>Executive director, Greenpeace, <strong>Ian Leggett </strong>Director, People &amp; Planet, <strong>Graham Wynne </strong>Chief executive, RSPB, <strong>Matthew Frost </strong>CEO, Tearfund, <strong>Dave Prentis </strong>General secretary, Unison,<strong> Fay Mansell </strong>Chair, Women's Institute<strong> and 20 other members of the Stop Climate Chaos coalition</strong> </p> <p>While Shell should be commended for disclosing its carbon footprint (Nearly half of FTSE-250 companies keep their carbon footprints hidden, October 8), the sheer scale of its emissions is staggering. That one company can be responsible for the release of more carbon than the whole of the UK is disturbing. And Shell's determination to treble investment in \"unconventional\" sources such as tar sands suggests it is unworried by increasing its emissions further and the impact that will have on developing countries. </p> <p>Shell's claim that producing oil from sands releases only 15% more pollution than conventional oil is misleading because it calculates the increase as a percentage of life-cycle emissions. The true carbon cost of the processes for which Shell is directly responsible - extracting and refining the oil - is 300-500% higher than for conventional oil.<br><strong>Phil Bloomer</strong><br>Campaigns and policy director, Oxfam </p> <p>Juliette Jowit's piece (End use of fossil fuels in 20 years, UK warned, October 7) reporting on the climate change committee makes encouraging reading, but it will not have done its job if aviation and shipping are not brought into the CO2 emissions audit, nor if Heathrow's third runway is allowed, nor if coal-fired power stations without CCS are built.</p> <p>Low-cost aviation should be squeezed out of existence as it encourages unnecessary flying, such as weekend stag parties. It has provided much of the demand for that third runway and other airport enlargements. And aviation should pay the same fuel duties as everything else. The proposed coal-fired power station at Kingsnorth will be criminal, unless it is turned into a CCS research project. </p> <p>The shilly-shallying must stop and actual CO2 reduction measures put in hand urgently.

Airport expansion disproportionately benefits the rich: the average income for passengers at London City Airport is twice the national average. Yet ordinary citizens, 50% of whom did not fly at all last year, will be asked to make greater carbon cuts to make up for the increased flights enjoyed by the minority.<br><strong>Cllr Darren Johnson AM</strong><br>Green, London assembly</p>",
  "<p>The UK's goods trade deficit climbed to its highest figure in more than 300 years in July, leading analysts to warn that the economy has fallen into recession.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics said yesterday that July's deficit with the rest of the world had been revised upwards to \u00a38.238bn - the biggest gap since records began in 1697. It blamed the revisions on a large number of late returns. The goods trade gap reached \u00a38.198bn in August, well above City forecasts of \u00a37.6bn.</p> <p>Paul Dales, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the data supported other evidence suggesting that Britain entered a recession in the past three months.</p> <p>\"Looking ahead, exporters are going to struggle against the background of a rapidly weakening world economy, as survey measures of export orders have recently fallen very sharply,\" he said. \"Overall, these figures suggest that the weakening in overseas activity is deepening the downturn in the UK economy.\"</p> <p>Philip Shaw, an Investec economist, said the figures showed how unbalanced the economy has become.</p> <p>The goods trade gap with non-EU countries widened to \u00a35.165bn from \u00a34.778bn. Analysts had predicted a deficit of \u00a34.6bn. These figures arrived just after the International Monetary Fund warned that Britain was heading into a full-blown recession. It said that the economy was likely to contract by 0.1% next year, the first annual fall since the recession of the early 1990s. </p> <p>Several analysts believe any boost to exports from a weaker pound has yet to generate substantial improvements in the trade balance. The dollar exchange rate has fallen from about two to the pound to 1.75 over the past three months, with the pound also dropping to record lows against the euro. \"August's UK trade data support our view that exporters will feel little benefit from the lower pound while overseas activity is so weak,\" Dales said.</p> <p>The fall in the pound's value over the past year was supposed to have boosted exports and pulled the economy out of trouble, but exports of chemicals, ships and cars fell last month.</p> <p>However, there was an improvement in the oil balance, which posted its narrowest deficit since July 2007 of \u00a3235m after July's \u00a31.629bn deficit, which was largely due to refinery maintenance work.</p> <p>There was also good news for the Bank of England as import rates fell by 1.4% in the month to August. Howard Archer at Global Insight said that this was in \"marked contrast to the sharp rises seen through the first half of the year\". </p> <p>\"This was entirely due to lower oil prices as import prices excluding oil rose by 0.4% month on month in August,\" he said. \"While the recent retreat in oil and commodity prices will help to contain import prices, this will be countered by the sharply weaker pound.\"</p>",
  "<p>EU heads of state plan to use the global financial crisis as an excuse to renege on climate change commitments, say sources close to energy talks in Brussels.</p> <p>Papers seen by the Guardian suggest the EU council, which meets next week, wants to drop the previous pledge of an automatic increase in emissions cuts if the world decides on a big climate change deal next year. It also intends to allow countries to avoid having to cut their own emissions by letting them purchase a large proportion of reductions from overseas.</p> <p>The EU has a target of 20% emissions cut by 2020. This would rise to 30% if a global deal is signed. But the papers show the EU is seeking a new legislative process if the EU target rises above 20%. This effectively shelves the move to 30% and would take many years to complete.</p> <p>The commission justifies its proposals by saying EU countries paying for emissions cuts would transfer up to \u20ac42bn (\u00a333bn) to developing and other countries from 2008-2020. It also wants a change in the auctioning of pollution allowances for power firms, which could lead to windfall profits estimated at up to \u20ac15bn.</p> <p>Last night, environmental groups said the moves could allow countries such as Britain to build a new generation of coal power stations without fear of exceeding their legally binding emission targets.</p> <p>\"By simply buying cheap projects in developing countries, the EU will avoid making the type of transformations needed in our domestic economy to avoid dangerous climate change,\" said Tom Picken, head of international climate at Friends of the Earth. </p> <p>Last week, it emerged that Poland, Greece, Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria opposed the package. In separate developments, Britain, Italy and others were accused of trying to dilute pledges for renewable energy.</p>",
  "<p>From the outside, the house at the bottom of Stocking Street looks no different from any other in the cul-de-sac. But step around the back and a purpose-built shed hums with the latest in green technology - a state of the art hydrogen fuel cell. </p> <p>Today the house in Lye, near Stourbridge in the West Midlands, will be opened as the first permanent hydrogen-powered home connected to the national grid. The refrigerator-sized fuel cell unit will produce 1.5kW of electricity and 3kW of heat for the occupants of the house, with any excess power being fed into the national grid.</p> <p>\"You shouldn't notice any difference in the house,\" said Waldemar Bujalski from the University of Birmingham's fuel cells group, which will monitor its performance and reliability. </p> <p>\"For the typical house, the unit is capable of providing 65% of the power on average and about 75% of total energy demand, both electricity and heat.\"</p> <p>There is no way yet to pipe hydrogen directly into homes, so the demonstration house will use natural gas that comes in via the existing mains supply. This is first passed through a steam reformer that generates hydrogen. The hydrogen is then combined with oxygen in a fuel cell unit, made by German company Baxi Innotech, that produces both electricity and heat and without producing carbon dioxide. Although creating the hydrogen from gas does produce some carbon dioxide, using the fuel cell cuts overall household emissions by 40% compared with running on gas alone. </p> <p>The electricity is fed directly into the house, while the heat warms water for the taps and conventional radiators. Bujalski said the demonstration house would be monitored by his team to see how well the fuel cell works, with the aim of ironing out problems before the devices reach the mass market. Initially they would cost about \u00a32,000 each, he said. In Germany, there are plans to install 800 hydrogen fuel cell units by 2010 as part of a large-scale demonstration of the technology.</p> <p>The UK's hydrogen-powered house is part of a broader \u00a32m programme of research led by the University of Birmingham to look at the full supply chain for producing, storing and using hydrogen in homes or cars. Hydrogen, a component of water and one of the earth's most abundant elements, is seen by many experts as one of the best clean alternatives to fossil fuels, if it can be created using carbon-free renewable energy and the infrastructure for transporting is established. </p> <p>The proton exchange membrane technology in use at Stocking Street is just one of the ways hydrogen could be harnessed in homes. The Birmingham team will examine other fuel cell technologies and ways of delivering the gas to the home, including using algae to create hydrogen, as they assess how hydrogen will work best in domestic use.</p> <p>Friends of the Earth's energy campaigner Neil Crumpton welcomed the development. \"In the coming decades many UK homes may be powered by fuel cells supplied by pipelines from a hydrogen gas grid.\"</p> <p>But he warned: \"The UK's ageing cast-iron gas pipeline infrastructure is just starting to be replaced by plastic pipes in a 20 year \u00a315bn rolling programme. Yet by the time it would be completed in 2030, methane gas may well be in short supply globally and very expensive. So it's crucial now to put in hydrogen-ready pipeline infrastructure.\"</p> <p>Richard Baines, director of sustainable development at the community regeneration agency Black Country Housing Group, which owns and will run the demonstration house, said: \"Hydrogen fuel cells are leading the way when it comes to green energy and it's our belief in this technology that has driven us to install the fuel cell. Minimising impact on the environment is everyone's responsibility, but as a social housing landlord we are able to make a real difference to the technology used in homes.\"</p>",
  "<p>MPs brought the power of God's word to deal with the financial crisis yesterday. But we also welcomed back Michael Fabricant from his Latin American hell. Chris Bryant, a new minister who is Harriet Harman's deputy, said how glad we all were that the Colombian police had released him so that he could be with us yesterday.</p> <p>I was abroad myself when the terrible events unfolded, but it appears that Mickey had been visiting the anarchic nation. Not trusting the local milk, he took with him a jar of Coffee-mate, a white powder which turns black coffee to a sludgy brown. Frankly, I'd rather drink milk squeezed from a diseased nanny goat but it takes all sorts. </p> <p>At some point a policeman saw the jar and decided it must be full of cocaine. Officers surrounded him and his friend, pointing their guns aggressively. \"Cocaine, cocaine!\" they shouted. \"No, coffee, coffee!\" he shouted back.</p> <p>There was only one way out. He had to eat quantities of the powder to prove it was harmless. The effect was, naturally to make him very ill, though not dead, which he would have been if it actually had been cocaine.</p> <p>I found the story highly evocative. The broiling South American sun gleaming off the gun barrels and glinting from Mickey's hair-style substance! The officers, with their swarthy, moustachioed faces! The member for Lichfield, once a successful disc jockey, choking as he tries to force down another spoonful as it sprays around his face. Surely it was a subject worthy of the canvas of a Goya! And failing that why did nobody take a picture on their mobe?</p> <p>Before then we had questions on the church. The church commissioner, Stuart Bell, was quite excited because in three years' time we celebrate the 400th anniversary of the King James Bible or authorised version - one of the finest pieces of writing in our language.</p> <p>Planning is advanced. According to Bell, in 2001 we will all \"break into joy and sing together\" (Isaiah 52.v.8). Tony Baldry, who raised the matter, linked it to the financial turbulence. \"In these troubled times it is worth recalling one phrase from the King James Bible: 'The grass withereth and the flower fadeth away, but the word of the Lord endureth forever'.\" That should steady the markets!</p> <p>Of course most MPs assumed that by \"the Lord\" he probably meant the future Lord Mandelson, who is expected to take his seat in the Upper House any day.</p> <p>Bell said that copies of the KJB would be distributed to children, including a new \"green bible\", a prospect that made Sir Patrick Cormack groan. And you can see why. </p> <p>The bible is specific on environmental matters. According to Genesis, God made us in His image so we could have \"dominion\" over all living things. And we should \"subdue\" the earth, which doesn't sound very Greenpeace to me.</p> <p>And as for those animal sacrifices and pillars of fire popping up everywhere, what kind of carbon footprint did they leave?</p>",
  "<p>Zimbabwe's official inflation rate has surged to 231m per cent as the opposition appealed to South Africa's former president, Thabo Mbeki, to rescue the historic power-sharing deal he brokered last month with President Robert Mugabe. </p> <p>Hyperinflation has contributed to widespread food shortages, prompting the World Food Programme to launch an appeal yesterday to feed 5 million Zimbabweans, some of whom it said are reduced to living on wild fruits. It said more than 80% of the population was surviving on less than \u00a31 a day, and nearly half of all Zimbabweans were chronically malnourished. </p> <p>The latest official inflation rate, for July, is 20 times higher than a month earlier. But independent economists who have accurately estimated the true rate in the past say that inflation this month will run into the trillions. That has forced the government to allow shops this week to begin accepting US dollars and the South African rand, because the Zimbabwe dollar is all but worthless. </p> <p>Those shops still selling in local currency raise their prices two or three times a day. Some price in \"units\" and display an ever rising rate of Zimbabwe dollars per unit. But finding cash is almost impossible because the government cannot afford to print notes to keep pace with inflation, and the bank limit on daily withdrawals is far less than the cost of a loaf of bread.</p> <p>Millions of Zimbabweans now bypass money altogether and barter what they can grow for other essentials. Others have almost no food, after another catastrophic crop failure largely attributed to the economic crisis and the seizure of white-owned farms. </p> <p>The WFP yesterday appealed for $140m to feed 5 million Zimbabweans, half the population. \"Millions of Zimbabweans have run out of food or are surviving on one meal a day and the crisis is going to get much worse,\" said Mustapha Darboe, the WFP regional director.</p> <p>The latest inflation figures and deepening food crisis will increase pressure on Mugabe to stop stalling over the composition of a new power-sharing government with the prime minister designate, Morgan Tsvangirai. The president has insisted on keeping control of all key cabinet posts, including security ministries such as the army and police, as well as the finance portfolio, even though foreign donors have stressed that there will be no aid to revive the economy unless it falls under Tsvangirai's control. </p> <p>Tsvangirai said yesterday that the talks were deadlocked and called for the intervention of Mbeki, who was forced to resign as South Africa's president last month. \"We have asked him to come over and he has said he will come over,\" he said.</p> <p>Tsvangirai added that he retained confidence in the agreement. \"We are confident about the potential of the deal,\" he said. \"In the process of implementation we have hit an impasse, but not on fundamental contents of the deal.\"</p> <p>\"Unfortunately no progress has been made ... to bring the Zimbabwean people to the beginning of the path of recovery. Instead the economic crisis has worsened. We now live in an environment characterised by hunger, starvation, and we are days away from seeing people dropping dead on the streets.\"</p> <p>Mugabe signed what he called a \"humiliating\" agreement surrendering many of his powers only because his government had no solution to the problems afflicting Zimbabwe, and that has not changed. Its attempt to curb inflation with enforced price reductions only drove trade on to the black market. </p> <p>The central bank removed 10 zeros from the currency in August after rapid devaluation forced it to print Z$100bn notes that were worth only 8p on the street when it was scrapped. But the new currency continued the free fall as it dropped from about Z$100 to the pound two months ago to Z$2m to the pound last week. </p> <p>Severe cash shortages had meant that many people could at least use electronic bank accounts as a means of payment, using a parallel market rate. But the government blocked such transfers last week, claiming they were used for illicit exchange deals.</p>",
  "<p>One question was going round markets and the media yesterday: is it working? The day after Gordon Brown launched his emergency rescue for banks, early signs were not good. The money markets, the subterranean plumbing of the financial system, remain distressed. Banks were charging each other 6.28% for a three-month loan yesterday - nearly two percentage points above the Bank of England's base rate. Bankers still do not have enough confidence in each other to lend at anything less than punitive rates.</p> <p>This does not mean Dr Brown's treatment has failed. Financiers need time to understand the difference the deal will make - the government guarantee on lending between banks in particular should surely have some effect soon. One fan of the British plan is the US treasury secretary, Hank Paulson, who is now talking about part-nationalising American banks too. That is quite some reversal. Still, there are two big reservations bankers surely have about the British scheme: one is the small print, the other is the big picture. The first is to do with the strings that will be attached to government help. This week's deal was hammered out in such a rush that financiers do not know the conditions the Treasury will impose on them. Instead, as each bank comes forward for its government money, it will have to haggle over what it gives up in return. Will the institutions have to clamp down on bosses' pay, or force a few executives to walk the plank? Officials would be quite justified in driving a very hard bargain and insisting that any hand-out has to be matched with a sharp increase in bank lending to individuals and businesses. Tighten the screws too much, however, and bank shareholders will balk, the markets will once again be roiled and the whole plan thrown up in the air. Mr Brown is surely justified in restricting dividend payments to bank shareholders which are a leakage of all-precious capital - but the very notion is bound to send shares plummeting. It would be sensible to suspend London trading in all securities tied to these distressed institutions until negotiations are closed.</p> <p>It is the big picture, however, that should frighten both bankers and ministers: the bleak outlook for the UK economy, and in particular the housing market. America's banking crisis was precipitated by a slump in house prices, which led to a collapse in the value of the mortgage-based securities held by so many institutions. Britain, however, has begun the other way around. Over 14 months into the credit crunch, the UK's crisis has been concentrated in banks. The housing collapse has yet to be felt, although it is gathering pace. The Bank of England yesterday revealed a 98% drop in net mortgage lending in August. As unemployment rises, the number of foreclosures and defaults on other loans is sure to rise too. The effect of that on lenders is likely to be dramatic.</p> <p>When historians come to discuss the great banking crisis of this decade they may crudely split it into three parts. The first, which hit last summer, was concentrated in those banks that relied on the money markets for their funding, such as Northern Rock. We are in the second phase: a general panic about the solvency of all banks, even those previously thought to be rock-solid. And the third is likely to be driven by consumers, as more default on all those loans on homes, cars and credit cards taken out during the boom years. This paper has called before for ministers to launch an economic stimulus package. To prevent the economy going into freefall, Mr Brown will need to spend more money - but this time on keeping people in houses, helping those who have lost jobs and creating employment in the public sector (such as working on green technologies). That level of spending may be unpalatable to an indebted government already dealing with one economic firestorm. But another looks set to break, and Mr Brown must be prepared.</p>",
  "<p>An early bounce in share prices after Wednesday's plunge did not last.

Since the start of this tumultuous week, the index has lost almost 700 points.</p> <p>Traders said financial stocks were pushing the New York market lower, possibly due to the end of the US ban on short-selling.</p> <p>Among UK banks, <strong>HBOS</strong> continued its gains in the wake of the government's bail-out plan, climbing 36.5p to 153.5p. <strong>Lloyds TSB</strong> edged up 1.75p to 211.75p and <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> rose 5.3p to 96p, but <strong>Barclays</strong> dropped 36.5p to 241.75p on suggestions it could tap shareholders for \u00a33bn before thinking about the government's rescue fund.

Panmure Gordon said: \"Given recent reports on concerns over the solvency of life insurers, we think the comments concerning its financial strength should reassure investors.\" But <strong>Standard Life</strong> lost 15p to 241.5p, partly on concerns about its exposure to the declining economy and partly on profit-taking after its recent rise.

  "<h2>Vodafone offers \u00a31.5bn for control of Vodacom</h2> <p>Vodafone is poised to take control of South Africa's largest mobile phone operator, Vodacom, after its local partner agreed to sell some of its shares in the joint venture. Vodafone has made a non-binding offer to pay Telkom 22.5bn rand (\u00a31.5bn) for a further 15% of Vodacom, which would take its stake to 65%. Under the proposed deal, its remaining 35% of shares would be floated. Vodafone hopes by taking control of Vodacom it will bolster its presence in Africa. Earlier this year it snapped up a controlling stake in Ghana's third-largest mobile phone company and also has operations in Kenya and Egypt.<br><strong>Chris Tryhorn</strong></p> <h2>LVMH toasts Chinese and Russian drinkers</h2> <p>LVMH has posted a 10% increase in quarterly underlying revenues, rising to \u20ac12bn (\u00a39.5bn) for the three months to September 30 - slightly ahead of analysts' forecasts despite the worsening financial crisis. The strongest growth came from the French group's fashion and leather division, including Louis Vuitton. Mo\u00ebt Hennessy, in which the London-listed Diageo has a 34% stake, saw sales rise 5%, after stripping out currency changes. Wealthy customers in China and Russia were continuing to switch to the highest premium champagnes and cognacs despite price rises, LVMH said.<br><strong>Simon Bowers</strong></p> <h2>PlayDigital signs majors up to add downloads</h2> <p>Play.com has signed up all the major record labels to its digital music store, PlayDigital, taking its offering to more than 3m tracks. The company said yesterday that Sony BMG, Warner and Universal would all be making tracks and albums available. The other major, EMI, has been on board since the service was launched in February, as have a number of independent labels. PlayDigital offers music for download without DRM (digital rights management) copy protection, which means customers can move tracks between devices.

The German government said yesterday that the October 27 timetable under which the initial public offering was scheduled had been disrupted by the global financial turmoil. The finance ministry insisted the sale of a 24.9% stake in Deutsche Bahn's mobility logistics unit would go ahead but did not give a new date. The company had been hoping a sale would raise \u20ac4.5bn (\u00a33.6bn), though analysts had been scaling back their forecasts towards \u20ac4bn ahead of yesterday's announcement of the delay.<br><strong>Mark Milner</strong></p> <h2>450 managers at BA take voluntary redundancy</h2> <p>British Airways said yesterday that 450 managerial jobs were being axed as part of a cost-cutting drive.

  "<p>I'm from Argentina and have just returned from Bolivia and Peru. Rory Carroll (Rampant violence is Latin America's 'worst epidemic', October 9) ignores the main culprits: not criminal gangs, but rightwing governments organised from Washington, which have ruled with impunity.</p> <p>Argentina, like Chile and others, is still recovering from military dictators who disappeared 30,000 people and from the laws which gave them impunity.

  "<p>Finding a buyer for Newcastle United could prove impossible in the current financial crisis, the man charged with selling the club admitted yesterday.</p> <p>Keith Harris, vice-chairman of the investment bank Seymour Pierce, said that the club's owner, Mike Ashley, could remain in control for much longer than anticipated, as a serious bidder has yet to emerge and the global meltdown of financial markets made it \"easy for people to find an excuse\" not to buy. Harris said that although several parties had shown an interest since Ashley asked him to help sell Newcastle last month, none had come up with a viable bid.</p> <p>Harris was speaking as Newcastle came to terms with yesterday's departure of Tony Jimenez, their vice-president in charge of recruitment and a key ally of Ashley and Dennis Wise. A Newcastle spokesman said Jimenez's departure would have no bearing on the future of Wise, the executive director (football), who has been the target of fans' resentment since the departure of the manager Kevin Keegan in September.</p> <p>Ashley - whose company Sports Direct is now worth \u00a3168m compared to \u00a31.7bn in February because of the stockmarket crash - has placed a price of \u00a3300m on the club, a figure few are willing to meet in the current climate. \"Mike did it [took over the club] for the right reasons and it hasn't worked out,\" said Harris. \"It is a major iconic brand and we are attracting interest, but this is a very easy climate for people to find an excuse. Newcastle has been transformed as a football club, they are a big club and I can see them going somewhere, but it requires time and careful attention.\" When asked if Ashley would stay on as owner because of a lack of acceptable bids, Harris replied: \"I wouldn't rule anything out.\" </p> <p>Harris, who believes the credit crunch will have a profound effect on the Premier League, defended Ashley's record, claiming he had wiped out the club's debt and invested heavily to improve the academy. \"He has done a lot of good there with the academy, there has been a lot of investment. When you look back through the years so many good players have come from that north-east corner, but how many were signed up by Newcastle? Not many.\"</p> <p>Magpies fans had hoped to see the back of Ashley long before the opening of the transfer window in January, with many still hankering after the return of Keegan. News of Jimenez's departure briefly raised the possibility that, if there was no takeover imminent, there could be a major reshuffle, which might tempt Keegan back. However, with Wise and the managing director, Derek Llambias, still employed, that looks unlikely. </p> <p>\"People should not fall into the mistake of believing that the departure of Jimenez is going to lead to the return of Kevin Keegan,\" said a club source. Jimenez, who wants to stay in football, is understood to have quit as a result of the uncertainty over the club's future ownership. Ashley has also indicated he will not fund the purchase of any new players in January if he is still in charge, effectively making Jimenez's recruitment job redundant.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Newcastle's Australian striker, Mark Viduka, is expected to be out for another six months as he needs an operation to solve a long-standing Achilles injury. The interim manager, Joe Kinnear, said: \"We know there is a chance Viduka may need surgery and if this turns out to be the case we will be without his services for a minimum of six months. This is not good news.\"</p>",
  "<p>This global economic crisis is affecting everything - even television. And nowhere is this more evident than in <strong>Natural Born Sellers</strong> (ITV1). It's basically The Apprentice for the credit crunch. No flash house in Notting Hill for these contestants; they're staying at the Holiday Inn, right by the M1, outside Wakefield (twin room: \u00a368). Their boardroom is the Holiday Inn conference room, which has a carpet designed in hell, by Satan himself. And their Sir Alan is John Caudwell. Who? That's what I'm saying, he's just some bloke who made a few quid selling mobile phones. OK, a few billion quid selling mobile phones, but admit it, you've never heard of him. And he's not even a Sir.</p> <p>There's nothing very glamorous about the tasks, either. In this one, they're selling double-glazing for West Yorkshire Windows, a family-run Wakefield business: 4% commission, with a target of 15 grand each for the week. </p> <p>You know what, though? It really doesn't matter. Because it is still weirdly mesmeric television. There are two reasons for this, I think. The first is the selling process itself, an extraordinary game of psychology and mind control that is absolutely fascinating, especially to those of us who don't - and couldn't - do it ourselves. And second, the people who make this show have realised - as the makers of the Apprentice did - that the way to guarantee success is to find the vilest, back-stabbingest, most amoral monsters in the country to take part. </p> <p>Like Danny, currently top dog, and a foul-mouthed sexist pig. \"She's evil, that fucking woman,\" he says of fellow contestant Thea. \"Fucking evil, the root of all evil.\" Danny says he'd rather douse himself in petrol and set fire to himself than get beaten by Thea. </p> <p>I think he means it, too - though to be fair to Danny, I think he may be right about Thea. \"I'm not just any woman,\" she says. \"I wear my balls on my chest, and they're much bigger than theirs, believe me.\"</p> <p>Then there's Gavin, who does his \"not the band\" joke every time he mentions the doors, which is a lot when that's what he's selling. And Scott, who learned from The Apprentice's Lee (\"that's what I'm talking about\") McQueen that a catchphrase is what you need to get on in this type of show. \"Check your bad self out bruvva,\" he says, after every single utterance. Almost. Imagine what <br>it would be like living with him. Or with any of them. Not only would it drive you mad, but you'd have to buy a big lock and chain for everything - even your own soul - in case they tried to sell it behind your back.</p> <p>Where do they find these people? They were all designed in hell, by Satan himself. But they make wonderful telly. Who said recession couldn't be fun?</p> <p>If you're ever invited to address a conference of narcoleptics, then my advice would be to politely decline, especially if you have any self-confidence issues or doubts about your ability as a public speaker. Look at this poor man at the Narcolepsy Network event in <strong>Ninety Naps a Day</strong> (Channel 4). He's a world expert, he's standing up there saying some really interesting stuff, and he looks down at his audience and they're all yawning, and nodding off, and lying down on the floor to go to sleep. Of course that's the nature of the condition, but it can't be much of a confidence boost. </p> <p>We're following three British narcoleptics to this conference in Albany, New York. Some of the things they do over there - the hugging, the laughing workshops, actually being open about their feelings - are a bit too much for our poor bottled-up Brits. But at least they're meeting other narcoleptics, for the first time in their lives. And for Christine, whose husband is one, she finally realises for the first time in 40 years that he hasn't been making it up. I don't know what she thought was going on - Ken even fell asleep on their first date in 1968; maybe she just thought she was being boring. </p> <p>I would have liked a little more science: something about what is actually going on inside these people to make them fall asleep the whole time. Maybe not enough is known, but it's more likely the programme-makers thought the science would send us to sleep. It was a still a moving film, though. </p> <p>The worst thing for narcoleptics (well, the second worst thing; the worst, obviously, being that they have this terrible debilitating condition that ruins their lives) must be that for everyone else it's quite funny. How annoying must that be.</p>",
  "<p>Throw away the newspaper. Turn off the radio. Forget the bank. There is nothing else to do at times like this but head for the hills, Kipling's \"immutable ones\" from whence, we all know, cometh our help.</p> <p>Britain may not do Indian summers any more, but it does Indian summer days. Last weekend, the bleakest summer in living memory closed with the most sensational of climatic codas.</p> <p>On Friday and Saturday the skies opened and the clouds burst, deluging hills, overflowing rivers and flooding plains. Then on Sunday someone threw a switch. The sun beamed out of a cloudless sky with such enticing loveliness that there was only one thing to do. Get the hell out of town fast, and head for the mountains.</p> <p>Regular readers will know that the mountain in question would be Cader Idris in southern Snowdonia, seat of giants and bards, where the Guardian's William Condry professed to find more stories than ever on the streets of London. Anyone who stays a night on Cader is said to come down mad or a poet. It is the star of Wales's greatest masterpiece, Richard Wilson's landscape in the Tate. I have never seen the peak more glorious than in the sunshine of last Sunday afternoon.</p> <p>First there was the water everywhere. The three western fingers of the Mawddach, Dysynni and Tal-y-Llyn valleys were a landscape of inundation. Roads were cut by floods. Rivers had become torrents. Bridges were dams and valley bottoms were under water.</p> <p>The whole of Merionethshire was an advertisement for climate change, with the sea swarming inland from Cardigan Bay to warn of things to come. Boats could have been sailed up the Dysynni to lay siege to Castell y Bere, as did Edward I against Llywelyn. This was truly an Ararat moment.</p> <p>The mountain itself was an astonishing sight. Once thought to be the highest in Britain (since it rose from near sea level), Cader from the north has been variously described as a crouching lion ready to pounce on England, or more prosaically a woman exhausted after passion.</p> <p>On Sunday its grey escarpments were like a massive geyser, bursting with millions of tons of surplus water. Cliffs and ridges spouted foam from every orifice. Flanks were streaked with white tresses. The southern cascade towards Minffordd, tearing away rocks and trees as it gouged out new gullies, would have passed muster at Niagara. The scoop of Cwm Cae roared with noise.</p> <p>Nowhere was free of water. It streamed down footpaths and poured from heather overhangs in a desperate race downhill. Fountains oozed from tussocks and sprouted from cracks in rocks, as from a sponge being squeezed. Over everything rose a sort of mist as hot sun fell on damp earth, drawing myriad shades of green and mauve from the dying heather.</p> <p>For once the mountain was near deserted, the routes to the summit blessedly left to recuperate from the daily pounding of reverential feet.</p> <p>Here there was a group of Birmingham campers, there one of Charterhouse schoolboys. The latter had spent the night awash under canvas and were now fighting their way to the top through obstacles laid in the way of all school trips by the health and safety executive. A teacher told me it was steadily bringing such youthful adventures to a halt.</p> <p>Present too was the hero of Cader Idris - its celebrated warden, Jack Grasse - immaculate as ever with black gaiters and ski poles. Having climbed the mountain a thousand times, and with a BBC documentary under his belt, he was hoping, on this clear day, for a view of Ireland's Wicklow mountains from the summit.</p> <p>Grasse has introduced generations of urban youngsters to the lore of these hills, knowing every sedge and saxifrage, every skylark, lapwing, pipit and buzzard. He is now witnessing a remarkable about-turn in the hill landscape, as the curse of sheep overstocking abates.</p> <p>Cader is recovering its contour ecology, from oak and pine round the foot, up through rowan, birch and hawthorn to heather, bilberry and gorse, all battling against the bracken. This so-called \"dwarf-scrub heath\" is the environment of my youth. It retains water and thus reduces the pace of run-off and resulting floods. On a sunny day it also forms an eiderdown bed.</p> <p>Why mountains are considered therapeutic has challenged writers since Francesco Petrarch in the 14th century. He was the first man to climb a mountain, Mont Ventoux in the south of France, in search of psychological redemption, though he at first professed a desire merely \"to see its conspicuous height\".</p> <p>Once aloft Petrarch \"turned my inward eye upon myself\" and admitted a need \"to trample those appetites that spring from earthly impulses\", possibly including Laura, a young girl with whom he had become infatuated at mass. He also wished \"to rise above the filth, no longer to be prostrate in my slothfulness in the valley of my sins\".</p> <p>Petrarch was founder of the mountain as metaphor. Baffled by his planned short-cuts constantly proving long ones, he rightly concluded that it was \"impossible for the human body to arrive at a summit by descending\". He was garrulous going up and silent coming down. Petrarch would have agreed with William Hazlitt that the true climber \"walks alone but dines in company\".</p> <p>Since then poets and priests alike have seen emotional potency in mountains. To the Swiss the Alps traditionally possess a power above the laws of man, an \"alpenglow\" reflecting the untapped treasures of the Earth. To Nepal's Buddhists the Himalayas are so sacred that men may not stand on them.</p> <p>All poets have, in their own way, been besotted with mountains. To Byron, \"high mountains are a feeling, but the hum /Of human cities torture\". Coleridge confessed himself \"intoxicated\" by vertigo (among other things), while Wordsworth went over the literary top on Snowdon, which he called \"that emblem of a mind that feeds upon infinity\".</p> <p>Where this leaves today's credit crunch is unclear, but there is no question that climbing a mountain (like sailing a boat) clears the mind of clutter. The world of libor rates, toxic loans and dodgy derivatives slides from view among the misty peaks, where the only predators are wheeling kites and crows. Francis Kilvert was right, that \"no man can be a beast or a fool on a great mountain\".</p> <p>At a time like this there is solace in the predictability of nature, manifested in a spot where nothing manmade is visible (except a pestilence of wind turbines). It is no wonder Petrarch felt himself \"between two peoples, the ancients and those not born, looking backwards and forwards at the same time\". He stood on a bridge between present and eternity.</p> <p>I would take the denizens of the City of London to the top of Cader and leave them to contemplate their sins for a day. But thank God it was not last Sunday.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:simon.jenkins@theguardian.com\">simon.jenkins@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Deep gloom has descended over Washington. For years, as the global economy enjoyed the longest boom since the late 1960s and early 1970s, the mood at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund was smug. This year, finance ministers and central bank governors meet amid justifiable concern that a month of mayhem in the markets will lead to a severe, widespread recession.</p> <p>Somewhat belatedly, the message from the IMF is that it might not have been the smartest idea for policymakers to connive in the build-up of asset-price bubbles. The unspoken sentiment is that central bankers like Alan Greenspan were asleep at the wheel and adopted macro-economic policies that were far too lax.</p> <p>To avoid future crises, the IMF says policymakers should give careful consideration to whether they should \"lean against the wind\". This makes sense. In the US, interest rates were cut from 6% to 1% to revive the economy after the dotcom bubble collapsed, and left there until Greenspan was confident the economy was back on its feet. By that time, the wave of cheap money had stimulated the biggest housing boom in US history. Having sucked millions of people into the real estate market Greenspan then tightened policy, raising interest rates 17 times. Boom turned to bust, and the Federal Reserve has now brought rates back to 1.5%.</p> <p>The Bank of England has been guilty of the same mistake. Rates were set too low when the bubble in the housing market was inflating and set too high when the bubble was deflating. Wednesday's half-point cut was welcome but it came far, far too late.</p> <p>Policymakers say leaning against the wind sounds splendid but is difficult to achieve. Inflation was low in Britain and the US when house prices were rising strongly; the Bank and the Fed would have been accused of pushing their economies towards deflation had they raised rates at that point. The risk is, however, that recent history will repeat itself unless macroeconomic policy is reformed in a post-crisis world. This requires changes to the regulatory framework, and to fiscal and monetary policy.</p> <p>It is now recognised that the pro-cyclical nature of credit creation was an important factor in causing the current crisis. Put simply: when times are good, banks are willing and able to lend more, thereby amplifying the boom. When times are bad, they turn off the tap when businesses and consumers most need it. The answer is to have a system where capital requirements and the amounts banks have to set aside are tightened during an upswing. Spain already has just such a system, and that has helped its banks cope much better than its rivals elsewhere. </p> <p>The same approach should be applied to fiscal policy. In the UK, the government continued to run budget deficits even when the economy was growing at rates of 3%, largely because Gordon Brown overestimated tax revenues. Now the economy is slowing, the scope for increases in spending or cuts in taxes to boost growth is constrained. A change to the fiscal rules is needed to ensure future governments cannot play fast and loose with the public finances.</p> <p>Finally, there is monetary policy. Here, the screaming need in the UK is for the Bank of England to have a more appropriate inflation target. Recessions tend to follow property booms, but the Bank uses the Consumer Prices Index, which excludes house prices and mortgage payments, when setting rates. This makes no sense; once the crisis has abated, the Treasury should abandon the CPI as its inflation benchmark. Unless it does so, any idea of the Bank leaning against the wind will be stillborn.</p> <p>\u2022 Larry Elliot is the Guardian's economics editor <a href=\"mailto:larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Michael O'Leary steeled us for the worst earlier this year when he said Europe needed a \"good, deep, bloody recession\". This week it became clear that the Ryanair chief executive is getting what he wished for. And more.</p> <p>Admitting that he might have, for once, undercooked his comments, he says: \"We might be talking about a depression. I would be very bearish for the next four or five years.\" O'Leary is talking hours after another scenery-chewing press conference. Not so much answering questions as working the room like a stand-up, he covered a range of subjects from global warming to journalists' luxury travel habits with a characteristic mix of sharp insight and expletives. Away from a larger audience, the quick mind is still at work but the presentation is toned down - an admission that the performance is an extension of Ryanair's garish advertising campaigns.</p> <p>\"If you can generate PR and controversy, it means more seat sales for Ryanair and that's mission accomplished,\" says the 47-year-old Irishman. Outside his one-man press circus, however, he is closer to the sombre mood enveloping the airline industry. About 30 carriers have gone bust this year, grounded by high fuel costs, and that number will rise as a global downturn turns the screw by reducing passenger numbers. Ryanair still plays the underdog but it is a major player in European aviation now and the more sceptical analysts are concerned that many of the airline's 49 million passengers last year were discretionary travellers who will disappear at the first whiff of recession.</p> <p>Asked how many Ryanair passengers are spur-of-the-moment purchasers, he guesses: \"We don't know. Between 20% and 40% is discretionary. There is no doubt that some of that traffic will not travel now.\" For an airline expecting to carry 58 million people in this financial year, that is a lot of customers. But if O'Leary is gloomy about a portion of his sales, he is scathing about his rivals' prospects. He is confident that cost-conscious customers lured by Ryanair's lower fares will make up the difference. \"Whatever the number of that traffic is, it will be more than made up by people who are deciding not to use Aer Lingus, easyJet or British Airways short haul. The price disparity is getting wider.\" He says Ryanair has \"pretty much filled\" all its flights this month and for much of November by snatching customers off competitors through seat sales.</p> <p>O'Leary's confidence is born of Ryanair's history. It has gone from a small carrier operating one plane out of Waterford airport 23 years ago to the world's largest in terms of international flights. Last year it reported profits of \u20ac439m (\u00a3345m). That is a considerable achievement in a global industry that barely recorded a positive profit margin over the same period, despite strong sales and relatively low fuel costs. </p> <p><strong>Optimistic</strong></p> <p>Nonetheless, those benign market conditions will not return to Europe for some time, according to even the most optimistic predictions, and O'Leary does not claim that Ryanair will be immune. The interview takes place in a hotel next to London's Victoria station, the rail gateway for Ryanair passengers travelling to Gatwick airport. Under his prognosis, fewer airline customers will be passing through in the next few years.</p> <p>\"The downside is that traffic will be down industry-wide. The upside is that the oil price will fall, the dollar will be weak and we have to try to trade our way through that.\" O'Leary is a disciple of Herb Kelleher, the founder of no-frills air travel and former chief executive of Dallas's Southwest Airlines, who ran his airline on four principles: fly one type of plane to cut engineering costs; keep overheads down; turn around aircraft quickly, and abandon air miles schemes. Ryanair under O'Leary has modernised those basics and created a lean business that, up to now, has grown inexorably.</p> <p>\"Five years ago we were half the size of BA. Now we're nearly twice the size of BA [in terms of passenger numbers].\"</p> <p>The basic strategy will not change in the downturn, he says, as the airline aims to double traffic and profits by 2012. Ryanair keeps its 166 planes in the air for as long as possible and packs the jets with passengers who might not pay much for their tickets but bolster profits by paying for add-ons such as baggage check-in, food and hotel hire. Overheads are kept low by buying fuel-efficient aircraft in bulk with aggressive discounts, cutting baggage-handling costs by restricting luggage through hefty check-in charges and flying to lesser-known airports that have cheaper landing fees. Once those tenets are in place and if oil stays below $100 (\u00a358) a barrel, Ryanair ensures it meets its target of filling 85% of seats per flight - the level at which it makes a profit - by selling tickets at aggressively low prices.</p> <p>Now that the hard work is done, after 14 years in charge, why not hand control to someone else? O'Leary's departure date is like a rolling contract. He always tells journalists that he is one or two years away from standing down and then, when the two years pass, he renews the pledge. This week, he doubled the estimate. \"The next couple of years will just get more interesting,\" he says. \"I plan to go in the next three to four years.\" </p> <p>He expects to have \"sorted out\" three issues by then: an ongoing dispute with Dublin airport; the future of Stansted airport, and Ryanair's planned acquisition of Aer Lingus. After that, he says, he might set up a long-haul airline. However, as Ryanair's fifth largest shareholder, he has considerable influence over his departure date and, when he goes, can spend his multimillion-euro fortune.</p> <p>O'Leary's achievements are widely respected within the industry, but some executives are irritated by his scattergun approach with the press. When he has warned of an industry slump in the past, shares in easyJet have dropped too, even if Ryanair's arch-competitor is seeing no downturn at all.

  "<p>The private sponsor of a troubled Middlesbrough academy is holding talks with the government to dissolve its sponsorship, which would be the first time an academy backer has pulled out.</p> <p>Amey plc has said it is in discussions with the government about the future of its sponsorship of Unity City Academy, one of the first of the private-sponsored schools established under Labour. </p> <p>There is no precedent of a private backer pulling out of an academy and there is considerable uncertainty about the future of the school. It is an embarrassing blow for the government, which is promising to rapidly expand the academy programme across the country.</p> <p>Robert Dore, the academy's principal, told the Times Educational Supplement: \"This situation has never occurred before, so if it goes ahead we don't know what it will mean for the school. We are waiting to be informed about what will happen.</p> <p>\"I am extremely concerned, but we will not let it affect the pupils here, who have made tremendous progress.\" </p> <p>Dore thanked Amey for their contribution, but added: \"The governors are now keen to move on from this and build on the work that has been undertaken.\" </p> <p>The school has been beset with problems. In 2005, two years after it opened, the \u00a343m school was failed by Ofsted after strong criticisms from inspectors. It is one of several academies threatened with closure under government plans to eliminate under-performing schools. However, in August it scored its best GCSE results. </p> <p>A spokesman for Amey confirmed that talks were taking place. \"Amey's expertise is in managing change and improving organisational efficiencies, and we felt we were in a strong position to support Unity City Academy in overcoming its challenges when we became involved in 2002.</p> <p>\"We have now seen four years of continuous improvements at the Academy. This is a fantastic achievement, and is a great testament to the hard work and commitment of UCA staff. We are now working with the Department for Children, Schools and Families to identify the best way forward.\"</p> <p>However, by the government's standard the school has had a turbulent educational record. In its first year 7% of pupils got five good GCSEs including English and maths; this year it was 18%, with results dropping twice within that period. With fewer than 30% of pupils hitting the target, it has been named a \"national challenge\" school which faces takeover or closure within three years if it does not rapidly improve. </p> <p>There has been speculation that academies could be hit by the credit crunch with private backers, many of them philanthropists who made their money through hedge funds and global investments, affected by the financial downturn. </p> <p>Many backers are also privately lamenting the loss of Lord Adonis, the architect of the programme, who was moved from his post as schools minister responsible for the schools to the transport department in last week's reshuffle.</p>",
  "<p>Alistair Darling will urge Britain's G7 partners today to consider emulating his emergency bail-out for their banks, as talks begin in Washington on a global action plan to end the financial crisis.</p> <p>The chancellor expects the G7 and the IMF to beef up their early warning systems to prevent future bubbles in financial markets, and to provide a comprehensive response to the credit crunch. \"We want to see these meetings come up with practical action,\" a Treasury source said.</p> <p>Darling's call for global action came as the IMF said it had drawn up emergency plans to bail out governments affected by the crisis. An IMF team has already arrived in Iceland, where the government is struggling to stave off a full-blown financial collapse.</p> <p>Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the IMF's managing director, said he had a war chest of $200bn (\u00a3116bn) at his disposal, which he could make available to desperate governments within a fortnight. The IMF's board has activated its emergency loan facility, which allows some of the usual stringent conditions to be waived. If necessary, Strauss-Kahn could call on IMF members to provide extra funds.</p> <p>He promised he was \"ready to answer any demand from a country facing problems,\" whether rich or poor. Geir Haarde, Iceland's prime minister, said last night an IMF loan was \"definitely an option\" to help his country stave off financial collapse.</p> <p>The IMF believes that the mix of the credit crunch and high food and energy prices will leave the finances of many countries dangerously exposed.</p> <p>Strauss-Kahn welcomed Wednesday's internationally coordinated interest rate cuts, but emphasised the need for governments to work more closely to tackle the market turmoil and ensure there is no return to \"business as usual\" when the immediate danger is over.</p> <p>He said his approach to rebuilding confidence was based on four principles: state action should have clear objectives; national plans had to be \"comprehensive\"; action needed to be coordinated at a regional and global level; and the taxpayer should share in any benefits.</p> <p>\"There is no domestic solution to a crisis like this one,\" he said, urging European governments, in particular, to avoid going it alone. \"Cooperation and coordination in actions is the price of success,\" he said. \"All kinds of cooperation have to be commended. All lonely acts have to be avoided, if not condemned.\" </p> <p>The IMF believes that pouring fresh cash into banks, as Britain has done, must be part of any successful rescue plan. Strauss-Kahn said the need for recapitalisation was \"well understood on both sides of the Atlantic\".</p> <p>Henry Paulson, the US treasury secretary, was given the power to inject capital directly into financial firms as part of the emergency bail-out bill passed by Congress. George Bush promised to take \"strong action\" yesterday to rebuild the battered US economy. </p> <p>The UK Treasury said the chancellor strongly supported the call for a comprehensive approach, and it was clear the problems of the banks had been caused by a lack of capital, liquidity and regulatory failures.</p> <p>Darling believes the failure of the IMF to spot early enough the risks being taken by the world's financial community was a major cause of the crisis. He now wants the fund to collaborate with the Financial Stability Forum, a group of central bankers and regulators, to draw up a robust system to limit the excesses of the markets during booms.</p> <p>Strauss-Kahn and Robert Zoellick, the president of the World Bank, stressed the need for international cooperation. </p> <p>Zoellick said the world was facing \"very shocking and difficult events\", but also called for rich countries to continue to meet their aid pledges.</p> <p>Noting that 28 countries were already highly vulnerable, as a result of higher food and fuel bills, Zoellick said that G7 countries, as a group, were still far behind on the financial commitments made at the Gleneagles summit in 2005.</p> <p>\"The poorest cannot be asked to pay the biggest price. For the poor, the costs of crisis can be lifelong,\" he said.</p> <p>Anti-poverty campaigners welcomed the IMF's pledge to help developing countries caught in the crisis, but warned that the hurdles to receiving the IMF's help might still be too high. </p> <p>\"No one could accuse the fund of being asleep at the wheel,\" said Marita Hutjes, a spokeswoman for Oxfam. \"It is coming up quickly with money to help countries cope. But for the poorest countries, it's still not doing it right. They can't borrow as much as they'll need, and most of that money will be subject to high numbers of conditions.\"</p>",

  "<p>The recruitment specialist Hays said yesterday that the fallout from the global banking crisis was beginning to hit the UK jobs market, with financial services and construction bearing the brunt.</p> <p>The company, which places permanent and temporary staff, said that over the three months to the end of September like-for-like fee income, which strips out currency movements, was up 4%. However, Hays signalled that market conditions were becoming more challenging.</p> <p>Demand for permanent staff was up by just 1% over the period compared with 8% growth in temporary placements. Paul Venables, finance director, said the split showed employers were becoming more uncertain about the outlook. \"When they are confident, companies take on permanent staff; when they get a bit more nervous, they look at temporary staff.\"</p> <p>In the UK and Ireland, like-for-like net income fell 8%. Hays said the demand for temporary workers had held up well, except in the construction and property sector, where the impact of the credit crunch was affecting demand.</p> <p>In the financial services sector, including the City, demand for permanent staff was down by about a fifth, though Venables said demand for contractors and temporary staff was holding up.</p> <p>In Asia-Pacific, like-for-like fee income rose 13%, while continental Europe and the rest of the world posted a 32% gain.</p>",
  "<p>The global economic crisis means financial re-regulation is, finally, on the agenda. Most agree it is needed on a global level. Some say this is impossible in a world of self-interested sovereign states, but we disagree: it is possible if we look at the context in which regulation is embedded. There we find the essence of the problem: tax havens. The offshore world created the conditions that led to this crisis, and unless the offshore world is tackled, it will undermine all efforts to deal with it.</p> <p>What do tax havens do? In truth, the term is a misnomer, and we prefer the term \"secrecy jurisdictions\". This is because they offer not one thing but three: low or zero taxes, secrecy, and lax regulation. In doing so they \"compete\" against reputable countries, trying to outdo them on ever lower corporate taxes and laxer regulation. As we said in our June submission to the Treasury committee on offshore financial centres, tax havens set out deliberately to \"undermine the impact of legislation passed in other jurisdictions\". This is their core business, and this is the threat they pose to the world.</p> <p>The impact of this is now visible in the economic crisis. The banking system has ceased to function because banks do not trust their peers' finances, structures and accounting disclosure. Opacity has been at the heart of the matter, and it is secrecy jurisdictions that create this opacity. First, they offer secrecy. All major banks have taken advantage of this, assisted by the \"big four\" firms of accountants who operate in all the world's significant tax havens.</p> <p>Second, they create uncertainty about who owns what. Offshore entities were used to isolate ownership of financial vehicles from onshore parents to secure higher credit ratings. The arrangements are often abusive, involving trusts and supposed charities. The result was, for instance, that when Northern Rock was nationalised, the Commons did not know whether this meant its Jersey-based shadow, Granite, was too. Its \u00a340bn of assets apparently existed in limbo. In consequence it is often the case that nobody knows who will honour the debts of what are, legally, separate entities. All of the victims of the current crisis had plunged very deep into this style of offshore operation.</p> <p>Third, they generate complexity, a form of opacity. Complexity has without doubt been used to shift risk from big institutions to society. Companies have spread complex structures across jurisdictions to exploit regulatory gaps. Even if each haven's claim to be properly regulated were true, the regulation of such firms falls between stools, since each jurisdiction only accepts responsibility for what happens in its domain. Regulation cannot function in such a world - a fact the failing banks exploited. And tax havens will enable many beneficiaries of the years of exuberance to protect their winnings in offshore black boxes, even if law courts wish otherwise.</p> <p>These havens are not just the palm-fringed islands of popular imagination. They are also places at the heart of the global economy. In particular the City has many offshore features. The IMF thinks London is offshore. When coupled with links to satellite havens like Jersey and Cayman, it becomes clear that Britain must be central to a global response to this problem. Gordon Brown and his predecessors have ignored this. As a result they have knowingly permitted the harm which secrecy jurisdictions wreak on the poor at home and abroad. Unless they are tackled, tax havens will sabotage any efforts to build global governance and international cooperation.</p> <p>That is why we must gear up for a global fight against tax havens. In the long term this push must stop regulation being embedded in a context riddled with powerful actors deliberately aiming to undermine it. More immediately, it must help policymakers address the crisis's fallout by giving them back powers to tax wealth and capital properly, and constrain what is a hothouse for cross-border crime. </p> <p>Tackling the increasing tension between global integration and a lack of credible international governance is impossible while these jurisdictions and their financial and criminal communities thwart attempts to deploy democratic controls. We emphasise, the secrecy jurisdictions' role in this is generic. Undermining democratic accountability is what they do for a living.</p> <p>Politicians can, and must, be braver now - public interest demands it.</p> <p>\u2022 Richard Murphy is a chartered accountant and founder of Tax Research LLP and Tax Justice Network; John Christensen is an economist and director of Tax Justice Network <a href=\"http://www.taxjustice.net\">taxjustice.net</a></p>",
  "<p>The collapse in the value of the US stockmarket accelerated yesterday as Wall Street shares fell to their lowest level for five years driven by urgent, relentless selling on trading floors.</p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average dived by 678 points to 8,579 in the blue chip index's third worst points fall of all time as alarm over the stability of the global financial system took hold. In percentage terms the index fell by 7%, exceeding the damage caused by last week's record one-day slump of 777 points.</p> <p>It was the seventh consecutive downward day on Wall Street, aggravated by a steady flow of international crises and by a sense of foreboding that the Bush administration's $700bn bail-out of the US banking industry may not work.</p> <p>The White House said George Bush would make a statement today to offer reassurance on the state of the economy.</p> <p>Bob Doll, head of equities at one of America's biggest investment firms, Blackrock, said the day-by-day tumble in stocks ought to be termed a crash after a 23% fall since the beginning of last week.</p> <p>\"I guess we have to call it that - it's been relentless, with not much relief along the way,\" he said. \"The Federal Reserve is going to have to be bigger, bolder and in front of this.\" A consensus is setting in that the US is in line for a deep recession. A survey of 52 economists by the Wall Street Journal found that most expected three consecutive quarters of negative growth, with the chances of a recession up from 60% to 89%.</p> <p>On Wall Street, banks took a hammering as a temporary ban on short-selling was lifted by US regulators, allowing hedge funds to resume betting on a fall in the stocks of fragile financial institutions. This was despite a confirmation from the White House that the US treasury is considering following Britain by acquiring equity stakes in major banks in return for injections of capital.</p> <p>Concern broadened to industrial sectors as America's biggest carmakers, General Motors and Ford, suffered a dramatic sell-off. GM's stock fell 31% on fears that it could be driven into bankruptcy by banks' reluctance to offer car loans to motorists.</p> <p>Traders said that there were simply no buyers in the market and that selling was becoming indiscriminate as collapsing hedge funds liquidate their portfolios and private investors cut their losses.</p> <p>\"I think the market's way oversold. But I can't stand in the way of this falling knife - I'd get sliced open,\" said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors. \"Investors are just saying, get me out at any price.\"</p> <p>The US sell-off gathered pace after the closure of European markets. In London, the FTSE 100 index suffered a more modest fall, dropping 1.2% or 52.9 points to 4,318 - its lowest close in four years. The FTSE 100 has so far fallen by 700 points this week. Banks such as HBOS and Royal Bank of Scotland closed 31% and 6% higher in the wake of the government's rescue package, but Barclays was London's worst-performing blue chip stock, down 13% on speculation that it may look to its shareholders for a capital injection rather than draw on the government's initial \u00a325bn of funds.</p> <p>Wall Street's tumble is likely to mean another highly volatile session for global markets today. There has been little sign of any easing on the rigid credit markets where banks, wounded by huge losses on mortgage-related securities, are reluctant to lend money. Shares in Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch slumped by 25% on concern that they may struggle to survive the credit crisis.</p> <p>It is a year to the day since Wall Street hit an all-time peak, with the Dow Jones touching 14,279. Since then, the index has lost 40% of its value. Any comfort provided by Wednesday's coordinated cut in interest rates in Europe and the US has quickly evaporated. Robert Buckland, global equity strategist at Citigroup, said policymakers were proving unable to get a grip on the crisis.</p> <p>\"The escalating financial crisis has battered world equity markets,\" he said. \"The failure of the policy response so far means that the risks of a major global economic downturn are rising by the day.\"</p> <p>In London, one professional investment manager who manages a portfolio worth billions of pounds said there were fears that share prices were now being pushed down by \"forced solvency sellers\", who have to liquidate holdings to meet demands for cash or regulations that require that shareholdings are sold below certain levels. \"It is unclear who is still selling at these levels,\" he said. \"Short selling is severely restricted and there cannot be any pension fund managers selling at these levels.\"</p>",
  "<p>America's biggest car manufacturers, General Motors and Ford, are facing a long, hard battle for survival tonight after Wall Street abruptly lost confidence in their financial stability in the face of plummeting vehicle sales.</p> <p>In the course of a few hours, GM's shares crashed by 31% to close at $4.76, their lowest level since 1950, while Ford's stock plunged by 21% to a 20-year low of $2.08 on mounting concern that both companies are at risk of bankruptcy.</p> <p>The Detroit-based carmakers, which have been the mainstays of US motor manufacturing for more than a century, are struggling to cope with an evaporation of bank funding for car loans to enable customers to purchase new vehicles.</p> <p>In a severe blow to their financial credibility, Standard &amp; Poor's said it was considering downgrading its credit ratings for both GM and Ford, citing \"the rapidly weakening state of most global automotive markets\". </p> <p>Both are already rated as offering \"junk\" debt, meaning that they are high-risk prospects for lenders, and a further reduction will make it even harder for them to borrow money. GM's sprawling empire includes brands such as Cadillac, Chevrolet, Saab and Vauxhall. It has traditionally been the largest of Detroit's \"big three\" carmakers, ahead of Ford and privately owned Chrysler.</p> <p>Even before the present economic slowdown, the US carmakers were losing headway to Japanese rivals because of a shift in tastes among American motorists from pickup trucks and sports utility vehicles to smaller, more fuel-efficient cars. The US government has promised $25bn (\u00a314bn) of loan guarantees to help the motor manufacturers stay on a firm financial footing. But experts are becoming increasingly concerned that this may not be sufficient to avert bankruptcy.</p> <p>\"These fears are justified,\" said George Magliano, a motor industry analyst at Global Insight in New York. \"Will they survive? Yes, I think so. But it's going to be a tough fight.\" As an economic slowdown dampens demand, global Insight expects sales of light vehicles in the US to fall from 16.1m to 13.6m this year, then to 13.4m in 2009, leaving the manufacturers scrambling to scale back on assembly-line production.</p> <p>A report by experts at Citigroup this week suggested that if conditions deteriorated further, Ford and GM could be forced into \"drastic spending cuts\" including slashing jobs and making new pay deals with unions \u2014 or even debt-for-equity exchanges, in which the banks would take ownership of part of the two companies. Citigroup's analyst Itay Michaeli said: \"Already weak balance-sheet positions will find it difficult to accommodate a prolonged global downturn. The risk-reward balance has tilted decidedly negative.\"</p> <p>General Motors plunged $38bn into the red last year, while Ford lost $2.7bn. In a recently recorded YouTube video appealing for support, GM's chief executive, Rick Wagoner, insisted the firm had a \"bright future\" but had hit a rocky patch.</p> <p>At today's share prices, GM was worth just $2.6bn, less than its capitalisation at the start of the Great Depression in 1929, and Ford was valued at less than $5bn \u2014 paltry sums for two companies that sell $353bn worth of vehicles annually.</p> <p>In Detroit, the companies' troubles have been greeted with gloom. Gerald Meyers, a University of Michigan business professor, told the Detroit News that morale was plummeting: \"It's like finding out that you have a terminal disease. You try to do something about it, but you know that you are in deep trouble.\"</p> <p>Ford and GM have been offering bargain-basement prices on cars. In a bid to save money, GM recently ended its 11-year run as a key sponsor of the Oscars in Hollywood. The company is trying to offload several of its brands including the gas-guzzling Hummer marque, which makes vehicles modelled on the Humvee armoured car used by the US army.</p> <p>Since 2006, Detroit's three major manufacturers have cut more than 100,000 jobs, hitting hard in the so-called \"rust belt\" of manufacturing across Michigan, Indiana and Ohio in America's midwest. Ford has mortgaged most of its assets to raise money, including its blue oval logo.</p>",
  "<p>Central banks around the world have finally reacted to the global financial crisis by engineering a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/marketturmoil.creditcrunch\">coordinated half-point interest rate cut</a>. That is welcome, but far more is needed \u2013 and quickly. If implemented now, steep rate cuts can still have a significant positive effect. If delayed, their effect is likely to be minimal. </p> <p>Across the board, the world's major central banks have been slow to respond to the deepening crisis. This failure reflects the dominance of conventional economics, which has produced closed-minded group-thinking within the global central banking community. As a result, central banks failed to see the oncoming financial tsunami, and even after it arrived they continued to fight the last war against inflation. </p> <p>The European Central Bank and the Bank of England have been the worst offenders. That is no surprise, as European central bankers are the most conventional in their thinking and have been the most obsessed with inflation. It also explains why continental Europe has had such high unemployment rates for so long. </p> <p>The United States Federal Reserve board has done a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jun/11/useconomicgrowth.economics\">much better job</a>, though it, too, has moved in fits and starts, repeatedly playing catch-up with a crisis that has persistently remained one step ahead of policy. This pattern reflects the Fed's own obsession with price stability, which encourages preemptive interest rate increases to head off inflation but restrains equivalent preemptive reductions to head off unemployment. </p> <p>Consequently, the Fed <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/fomc/fundsrate.htm\">left its interest rate unchanged</a> throughout the summer of 2008, despite the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">collapse of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, AIG's insolvency</a>, and the emergence of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketturmoil\">global financial-market contagion</a>. Moreover, Fed policy remained constant despite rapid deterioration in America's real economy, indicated by accelerating job losses and rising unemployment. </p> <p>The coordinated rate cut now undertaken by the world's major central banks begins the process of policy catch-up, but further cuts are needed. Whereas the bogey of inflation seems finally to have been laid to rest, another myth must still be challenged \u2013 that the Fed and other central banks should save their \"bullets\" for a rainy day and should therefore resist cutting rates.<br> There is an old saying about monetary policy being useless in recession because the effect of lowering interest rates is like \"pushing on a string\". That happens when confidence and wealth have been destroyed, at which point rate cuts do indeed become useless. This is because the destruction of confidence undermines the \"animal spirits\" of capitalism: borrowers are unwilling to borrow and lenders are unwilling to lend. The destruction of wealth also destroys collateral, which means that even those who wish to borrow cannot. Meanwhile, insolvencies and foreclosures triggered by excessive interest burdens are not reversed by later rate cuts. </p> <p>By failing to act in a timely fashion, central banks have allowed a dangerous erosion of confidence and wealth, which is creating \"pushing on a string\" conditions. Fortunately, there is still time for decisive rate cuts now to have a robust impact. But the window of opportunity is closing fast. If central banks save their \"rate cut\" bullets for a later day, they may find that their ammunition is useless. The time to shoot is now. </p> <p><em>Thomas Palley is the author of Post-Keynesian Economics.</em> </p> <p>Copyright, <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2008.</p>",

Toyota recently stole GM's crown as the world's most prolific manufacturer of vehicles.</p> <p>In Detroit, the companies' troubles have been greeted with gloom. Gerald Meyers, a University of Michigan business professor, told the Detroit News that morale was plummeting: \"It's like finding out that you have a terminal disease. You try to do something about it, but you know and everyone around you knows that you are in deep trouble.\"</p> <p>Ford and GM have been offering bargain-basement prices on cars. In a bid to save money, GM recently ended its 11-year run as a key sponsor of the Oscars in Hollywood. The company is trying to sell several of its brands including the gas-guzzling Hummer marque which makes vehicles modelled on the Humvee armoured car used by the US army.</p> <p>Since 2006, Detroit's three major manufacturers have cut more than 100,000 jobs, hitting hard in the so-called \"rust belt\" of manufacturing across Michigan, Indiana and Ohio in America's midwest.</p> <p>Ford mortgaged most of its assets to raise money, including its blue oval logo known around the world. GM has suspended dividend payments to shareholders for the first time since 1922 and has axed bonuses for its senior executives.</p>",
  "<p>The massive state intervention into the financial markets was born of necessity not desire. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">All the way along</a>, from Northern Rock, through to Bradford and Bingley and now the massive injection of liquidity into the banking system, the prime minister and the chancellor have acted on a step by step basis, always reluctant to make the ideological case that public interest in the private economy can work and that the state needs to play a more active role in the workings of the market.<br> But whether they like it or not, reality is pressing hard up against the fundamental presumptions that underpin New Labour economics, as Larry Elliott <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/2008/oct/08/economics.creditcrunch\">argued today</a>. Let us be clear: this was always different from full-blooded Thatcherism. For neo-liberalism, there is no place for the state except in enforcing and policing the market. The free market in that sense always demands a strong state. Thatcherism didn't care whether people sank or swam \u2013 that was up to them and the market. The leap that New Labour made was to argue that the state should play an active role in helping people to negotiate the economic tides of globalisation. That is why we have seen a huge investment in supply side measures over the last decade: training and education in particular. But while the means were new and welcome, the endgame was the same: successful competition at a personal and national level in global competitive markets. <br> Those markets that have been left too free for too long have come back to bite. And not just in finance but in food, fuel and housing. The consumer debt binge fuelled by overpriced property was always going to turn toxic. And here is the central challenge to New Labour economic orthodoxy. It is built on the premise that economic efficiency and social justice go hand in hand. They often can. We need a dynamic economy in order to invest in society and public services. But the two don't always go together. What is economically efficient is not necessarily socially just. Not having a word to say or a measure to take on unjust <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/aug/28/money.executivepay\">executive bonuses</a> might be economically efficient for a few, but it is not socially just for the many. It's the same with flexible labour markets that drive wages and conditions down. Of course they help the owners of capital, but not the workforce. The job of centre-left politicians is to adjudicate on when and where social needs come above economic demands. That does not make them anti-business, just pro-society.<br> Now the chickens are coming home to roost. Three decades of deregulation and economic liberalism have caused a perfect storm of insecurity and anxiety. The rescue package may work to stem the tide, and we should all hope it does. But unless wider and deeper lessons are learnt about the relationship between the market, economic efficiency and social justice then any period of calm will just be a lull in a storm. </p>",
  "<p>An early bounce in share prices after yesterday's plunge did not last out the day.</p> <p>With Wall Street in decline yet again in early trading, the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> ended 52.9 points lower at 4313.8, its lowest level since Friday August 13 2004.

  "<p>There has already been approximately <a href=\"http://elections.foxnews.com/2008/10/08/editorial-roundup-newspapers-weigh-second-presidential-debate/\">1,375,294 words written</a> about Tuesday night's <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5irCWkOK7mXeHKYSxW_Ux2TISdKQwD93MLP701\">presidential debate</a> between Barack Obama and John McCain, much of it falling into the usual metaphor of a sports contest. But talk of home runs or goals or touch-downs, or whatever the vocabulary of your preferred sport might be, misses the point.</p> <p>When I look back on those 90 minutes I don't see a game of football. It was much more significant than that. For me Tuesday night was the moment at which Obama finally cloaked himself in the mantle of president.</p> <p>It was like watching him emerge from the pupa in which he has been metamorphosing for the past two years and spread his wings. The politician on display was not the same politician I first saw <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/dec/12/usa.barackobama \">dazzling a crowd in New Hampshire</a> in December 2006. Yes there have been flashes of his potential along the way \u2013 plenty of them. He has at times been charistmatic, statesmanlike, inspirational and his oratorical powers have never been in doubt. But this week those elements all came together in one presidential package.</p> <p>What does it mean to look presidential? That's the perennial question that hangs over all American presidential elections and millions of dollars and thousands of hours of effort are devoted to trying to answer it.</p> <p>It is both the most complex and the simplest question in US politics. Simplest because you know it when it you see it. And I saw it on Tuesday night.</p> <p>Obama was calm and in control, both of his own emotions and the media event in which he participated. When he talked about the financial crisis he rose in stature, as if he were drawing strength from the global meltdown. McCain, by contrast, appeared overwhelmed by the scale of the disaster.</p> <p>If you know a presidential look when you see it, the converse also holds true. Earlier this year I spent weeks travelling round America visiting previous <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/mar/29/uselections2008.usa\">failed presidential candidates</a>. They were a very fine bunch of individuals, including a man who, like many before me including Hunter S Thompson, I came to admire very deeply \u2013 George McGovern. But even he had that look, the look of the loser. I saw it again this week, in John McCain.</p> <p>In hindsight the people I talked to lost because they fell into one of three categories. Some were insufficiently charismatic in the age of the television soundbite (Walter Mondale) others were swimming against the tide of history (Michael Dukakis) or brought down by their ill-considered choice of running mate (McGovern). </p> <p>John McCain is unique. He falls into all three.</p> <p>In his increasingly desperate attempts to dent Obama's armour plating, he says that America does not have the luxury for its next president to have on-the-job training. But by repeating that mantra, as he did again on Tuesday, he merely shows that he has not been paying attention.</p> <p>The truth is, Obama has spent the past two years engaging in precisely that \u2013 intensive on-the-job training. He started the crash course in January 2007 as a little-known first-time senator from Illinois. On Tuesday night he graduated. Barack Obama is ready to be president.</p>",
  "<p></p> <p>The future of mobile is not about the phone but about mobility, says dutch developer <strong>Stefan Fountain</strong>, of <strong><a href=\"http://www.soocial.com/intro\">Soocial</a></strong>. He already has reputation as a \"rock'n'roll developer\", whatever that means, and there's a good crowd for his talk.</p> <p>He talks about two key principles around mobile internet.</p> <p>The first is location: \"There's nothing more important to the human condition than the physical location we are at, and computers just don't know that. If we're in the bedroom we're busy or sleeping and don't want to be disturbed. The computer should know this.\" The <strong>iPhone</strong> might have the 'locate me now feature', but you have to tell it to tell you where you are. Location should be implicit. And he doesn't seem to have too many concerns over data privacy. \"In the past people were scared of trains, and thought that if the human body went faster then 40 mph it would disintegrate.\" He thinks we will move into a state of mutual consent between us and our devices. Mobile apps could go one step further; you could ask your phone for a good restaurant and it would simply say \"turn left\".</p> <p>Visibility is his second point, and this is about the ubiquity of technology. Once a technology becomes totally essential in your life, it becomes invisible. He talked about how technologies move towards the mainstream by commoditisation; they move from being a rare thing, through a stage with lots of copycats, to be standardised across different versions to a final state of ubiquity. (And then presumably, obsolescence, but he didn't get that far...)</p> <p>It is all about ubiquity, he says, about the harmonisation of environment, context and presence, and about services. It doesn't matter what the device is - it's about the data on that device and all those factors that make it relevant for someone. If you want to check your <strong>Gmail</strong>, you don't care if that is on your work computer, home computer, friend's computer or on mobile - all you want is the data.</p> <p>He showed a diagram of something resembling a sophisticated compost heap layered with, from the bottom up, the web, mobile devices, mobile data and mobile actions. As each of these sectors has evolved, the previous one has become slightly less visible.</p> <p>Time for the pitch, delivered in a slick, dubbed Knight Rider mashup... Soocial syncs contacts between different address book systems, so between the <strong>Mac Address Book</strong>, Gmail and its own web app but today announced support for <strong>Outlook</strong> and <strong>Blackberry</strong> too. Any Soocial users out there? Given the mess caused by Apple's <strong>MobileMe</strong> failing, repeatedly, I'm inclined to give it a try. Fountain says Soocial is destined to do well because \"all successful companies have two 'Os' in their name...\"</p> <p>And he finished by rousing the troops of developers in the audience, quoting computer scientist <strong><a href=\"http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/alan_kay_shares_a_powerful_idea_about_ideas.html\">Alan Kay</a></strong>'s famous line that 'the best way to predict the future is to invent it'. \"We have the power to control the future.

  "<p>Leaders of EU countries plan to use the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketturmoil\">global financial crisis</a> as an excuse to renege on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketturmoil\">climate change</a> commitments, according to sources close to energy negotiations in Brussels.</p> <p>Papers seen by the Guardian suggest the EU council, which meets next week, propose dropping the previous commitment to an automatic increase in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbonemissions\">emissions</a> cuts if the world gets a major climate change agreement next year. It also intends to allow countries to avoid having to cut their own emissions by letting them purchase a large proportion of reductions from overseas. </p> <p>The current EU target of a 20% reduction in emissions by 2020 will automatically increase to 30% if a global deal is signed. But the papers show that the EU is seeking a completely new legislative process if the EU target is to go over 20%. This effectively shelves the move to 30% and would take many years to complete. </p> <p>The commission justifies its proposals by saying that EU countries paying for emissions cuts would transfer up to \u20ac42bn (\u00a333bn) to developing and other countries from 2008-2020.</p> <p>It also wants a change in the auctioning of pollution allowances for power companies, which could lead to windfall profits estimated at up to \u20ac15bn. </p> <p>Last night environmental groups said the moves could allow countries such as Britain to build a new generation of coal power stations without fear of exceeding their legally binding emission targets. </p> <p>\"By simply buying cheap projects in developing countries, the EU will avoid making the type of transformations needed in our domestic economy needed to avoid dangerous climate change,\" said Tom Picken, head of international climate at Friends of the Earth.</p> <p>\"We are on the verge of losing an ambitious climate package. It sends the wrong signal to developing countries \u2014 it appears that developed countries are not willing to adopt domestic emission reduction targets,\" said a WWF spokeswoman. </p> <p>The moves come as energy ministers prepare to meet in Luxembourg on Friday in advance of the heads of state meeting next week, where the climate change and energy package of measures will be addressed. New British climate change and energy secretary, Ed Miliband, will attend. </p> <p>Last week, it emerged that Poland, Greece, Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria had opposed the whole package. In separate developments Britain, Italy and others were accused of trying to water down commitments for renewable energy. </p> <p>News of the European political leaders' moves comes as senior business figures and government advisers are urging politicians not to use the current financial crisis to abandon crucial investment in clean energy and efficiency to tackle climate change, cut costs and improve security.</p> <p>On Thursday, Lord Browne of Madingley, the former chief executive of BP, warned \"none of what's happened \u2014 however dramatic or distressing \u2014 detracts from what remains our most pressing energy challenge: combating climate change.\"</p> <p>Browne, now president of the Royal Academy of Engineering, called for a big political investment in new energy technology to match the US Marshall Plan that rebuilt economies after the second world war. \"What is called for is nothing less than a new generation of political leadership \u2014 leadership that transcends the day-to-day tussle of electoral politics and short-term economic cycles,\" he said.</p> <p>Miliband insisted the UK was negotiating the best deal possible. He added: \"Now is not the time to row back on our ambitions in tackling climate change. Cutting the costs of energy is good for people as it keeps down their fuel bills and it's good for the planet as it reduces dangerous climate change. </p> <p>\"The current economic difficulties make these issues more important, not less. EU ministers have rightly signed up to achieve 20% of energy coming from renewable energy sources by 2020 and it is important we show that we are committed to that target.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Monday October 13 2008.

  "<p>Modern Egypt has been <a href=\"http://www.opendemocracy.net/article/egypt-the-surreal-painting\">compared to a surrealist painting</a>: difficult to decipher and comprehend, dominated by dark, abrasive lines at the centre yet giving way to softer, more hopeful brush strokes at the periphery. Tarek Osman, the excellent writer who conceived the metaphor, used it to describe the politics, society and culture of the nation as a whole. But it also works when applied to the country's complex media landscape, the shifting contours of which \u2013 in print, on television and through the web \u2013 have been thrown into sharp relief in recent days.</p> <p>The big news has been the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7656022.stm\">presidential pardon</a> of the controversial editor and outspoken regime critic Ibrahim Eissa, who sits at the helm of al-Dostour newspaper. This phenomenally popular daily has been a constant thorn in the government's side since it reopened in 2005 \u2013 seven years after being shut down for publishing an Islamist statement. In August last year, as whispers regarding Hosni Mubarak's health swirled through the streets, Eissa had the mendacity to <a href=\"http://elijahzarwan.net/blog/?p=819\">write</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>The president in Egypt is a god and gods don't get sick. Thus, President Mubarak, those surrounding him, and the hypocrites hide his illness and leave the country prey to rumours. It is not a serious illness. It's just old age. But the Egyptian people are entitled to know if the president is down with something as minor as the flu.</p> </blockquote> <p>In an Orwellian doublespeak world where the president <a href=\"http://www.sis.gov.eg/En/Politics/Presidency/President/Interview/000001/0401050300000000000205.htm\">declares</a> his belief in press freedom to be \"unshakeable\" and promises that no journalist will go to jail for doing their job, that paragraph was enough to land Eissa in court, where he was accused of single-handedly undermining international confidence in Egypt's stability and wiping $350m off the stock market.</p> <p>The protracted legal drama that followed finally came to an end this week, when Mubarak used the occasion of Armed Forces Day to publicly revoke Eissa's two-month prison sentence, a sentence which <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gf7XYKC_zZv9Y-qby7mZt0dr9GagD93FQEUO0\">Eissa had warned</a> would \"open the gates of hell for the Egyptian press.\" The blogosphere was underwhelmed by the president's generosity. \"Mubarak is most misericordious and most merciful, is He not?\" commented a particularly <a href=\"http://arabist.net/archives/2008/10/07/eissa-released-by-mubarak/\">earnest fan</a>.</p> <p>On the face of it, Eissa's pardon does little to change the reality of press censorship in Egypt. As the Cairo-based journalist Will Ward has <a href=\"http://willward.wordpress.com/2008/10/07/eissa-pardon-no-is-victory-for-press-freedom/\">pointed out</a>, the case against Eissa was more about \"touching up\" the invisible red line prohibiting reports on the health of Mubarak, who turned 80 this year, than putting any individuals behind bars, and in this respect the state has got what it wanted. It's clear that any genuine commitment to freedom of expression can't be dependent on the arbitrary whims of a corrupt autocrat \u2013 hence the continued presence of those dark, abrasive lines at the centre of the painting, where control over information seems to flow in one direction only.</p> <p>But look closer and you'll see the picture become more complex. As the political analyst Khalil al-Anani has <a href=\"http://www.dailystaregypt.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=16905\">observed</a> while exploring the efforts of the Egyptian state to protect itself by silencing civil opposition, \"the dilemma of authoritarian regimes is that they are stupid\". I've <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/07/egypt.middleeast\">written here before</a> about how the ruling elite's ham-fisted attempts to handle the independent media sector have backfired; in a globalised media environment it's simply impossible for the regime to \"get the cat back in the bag\" when it comes to the broadcasting of opposition voices in public.</p> <p>Moreover, legal attacks on prominent figures like Eissa are a source of keen embarrassment to the younger generation of party high-fliers clustered around the president's son Gamal, who preaches the rhetoric of openness and transparency (while climbing into bed with some of the country's most dishonest businessmen). This younger cadre is expected to make its voice heard at the ruling NDP's annual conference next month.</p> <p>The result is that such intermittent media crackdowns, the repainting of those thick dark lines on the picture, actually serve to blur the lineation of power in Egypt, creating new opportunities for other political actors to stake a claim.</p> <p>And the really interesting thing about the media landscape in Egypt is the way in which those other political actors are also being emboldened, checked and divided by the opening up of the country's media scene. The spread of internet access, while still largely restricted to the urban middle class and increasingly <a href=\"http://theegyptblog.blogspot.com/2008/08/egypt-demanding-data-from-cyber-cafs.html\">monitored by the government</a>, is funnelling a plurality of voices into the political mix, and the NDP aren't the only organisation to be shaken up by the ensuing turmoil.</p> <p>The Muslim Brotherhood, technically Egypt's largest opposition group despite being legally outlawed, is facing a tsunami of <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-brotherhood3-2008oct03,1,5596077.story\">dissent</a> from within its own ranks as young Islamist bloggers attack the conservative leadership for their stance on religious freedom and women's rights. The bloggers \"have gone beyond their role as a media tool\" for the brotherhood, according to a <a href=\"http://www.arabinsight.org/aiarticles/186.pdf\">recent edition</a> of Arab Insight, and have emerged instead as \"rebels, freed from ideological and organisational constraints.\" The dynamism of Egypt's new media has proved a double-edged sword for the Brotherhood's old guard, who have discovered, perhaps too late, that your enemy's enemy isn't always your friend.</p> <p>Despite the bitter setbacks faced by journalists across different formats trying to expose injustice and improbity at the heart of the Arab world's largest country, the government's suffocating grip on the media here is slowly weakening. There is nothing linear about this process: writers and activists whose work is channelled through the net are routinely <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0730/p04s04-wome.html\">rounded up</a>; the explosion of foreign satellite channels in recent years has been accompanied by <a href=\"http://www.metimes.com/International/2008/09/12/egypt_media_threatened_with_more_restrictions/3717/\">police raids</a> on programme-makers; the rise of independent ownership within the Egyptian newspaper industry is undermined by court cases against non-compliant editors.</p> <p>But the critical feature of this media environment is that these shocks to the system, the heavy-handed application of black lines on the canvas, are constantly creating new opportunities for colourful and unexpected brush strokes on the margins \u2013 and those margins are encroaching upon the centre day by day.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown learned that the Bank of England was joining other major central banks in the biggest emergency interest rate cut in history only minutes before it happened yesterday.</p> <p>The world's central banks organised Wednesday's coordinated interest rate cuts among themselves without reference to their respective governments, guardian.co.uk has learned.</p> <p>The Treasury was informed of the impending half-point rate cut 15 minutes before it was announced by Threadneedle Street, and was only given advance warning so that the prime minister would not suffer the embarrassment of hearing about the rate cut during his speech in the House of Commons. (Usually, the Treasury finds out the interest rate decision at the same time as the general public).</p> <p>It had widely been assumed in the wake of the combined rate cuts on Wednesday that Brown and the chancellor, Alistair Darling, had leaned on Bank governor Mervyn King to support their \u00a3500bn bank rescue plan with a cut in interest rates. But that was not the case, sources have told the guardian.co.uk. </p> <p>Central banks, including the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, looked at the deteriorating financial and economic situation and decided that a dramatic response was required.

McCain repeatedly mentioned nuclear power, while Obama made the now-obligatory nod to \"clean coal.\"</p> <p>But for a few minutes in the middle of it all, the debate touched specifically on climate change with a question from an audience member that produced very different answers from the candidates.</p> <p>The question came from <a href=\"http://gristmill.grist.org/story/2008/10/8/9127/50970\">Ingrid Jackson</a>: <strong>\"Sen. McCain, I want to know, we saw that Congress moved pretty fast in the face of an economic crisis. I want to know what you would do within the first two years to make sure that Congress moves fast as far as environmental issues, like climate change and green jobs.\"</strong></p> <p>McCain's response nods at the importance of addressing climate change, but then goes on to stress that the United States needs to invest in a broad range of energy sources, particularly nuclear power. Here's his response in full:</p> <blockquote> <p>Well, thank you. Look, we are in tough economic times; we all know that. And let's keep \u2014 never forget the struggle that Americans are in today. But when we can \u2014 when we have an issue that we may hand our children and our grandchildren a damaged planet, I have disagreed strongly with the Bush administration on this issue. I traveled all over the world looking at the effects of greenhouse-gas emissions, Joe Lieberman and I.</p> <p> And I introduced the first legislation, and we forced votes on it. That's the good news, my friends. The bad news is we lost. But we kept the debate going, and we kept this issue to -- to posing to Americans the danger that climate change opposes. Now, how -- what's -- what's the best way of fixing it? Nuclear power. Sen. Obama says that it has to be safe or disposable or something like that.</p> <p> Look, I was on Navy ships that had nuclear power plants. Nuclear power is safe, and it's clean, and it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs. And I know that we can reprocess the spent nuclear fuel. The Japanese, the British, the French do it. And we can do it, too. Sen. Obama has opposed that. We can move forward, and clean up our climate, and develop green technologies, and alternate -- alternative energies for -- for hybrid, for hydrogen, for battery-powered cars, so that we can clean up our environment and at the same time get our economy going by creating millions of jobs.</p> </blockquote> <p>Obama, <a href=\"http://gristmill.grist.org/story/2008/10/7/192054/490\">in his response to the same question</a>, called for public investment in finding solutions to climate change, including support for wind, solar, and geothermal energy. He challenged McCain on his votes against <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/renewableenergy\">renewables</a> during his time in the Senate and directly countered the notion that drilling offshore is a solution to the nation's energy concerns:</p> <blockquote> <p>This is one of the biggest challenges of our times. And it is absolutely critical that we understand this is not just a challenge, it's an opportunity, because if we create a new energy economy, we can create 5 million new jobs, easily, here in the United States. It can be an engine that drives us into the future the same way the computer was the engine for economic growth over the last couple of decades.</p> <p> And we can do it, but we're going to have to make an investment. The same way the computer was originally invented by a bunch of government scientists who were trying to figure out, for defense purposes, how to communicate, we've got to understand that this is a national security issue, as well. And that's why we've got to make some investments and I've called for investments in solar, wind, geothermal. Contrary to what Sen. McCain keeps on saying, I favor nuclear power as one component of our overall energy mix.</p> <p> But this is another example where I think it is important to look at the record. Sen. McCain and I actually agree on something. He said a while back that the big problem with energy is that for 30 years, politicians in Washington haven't done anything. What Sen. McCain doesn't mention is he's been there 26 of them. And during that time, he voted 23 times against alternative fuels, 23 times. So it's easy to talk about this stuff during a campaign, but it's important for us to understand that it requires a sustained effort from the next president.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>So far, the responses amount to the typical thrust and parry of the campaign, with the candidates jousting over political points and generalities about investing in alternative energy sources. But Obama, in directly taking on the Republicans' pro-drilling talking points, talked quite frankly about the scope of the climate challenge:</p> <blockquote> <p>One last point I want to make on energy. Sen. McCain talks a lot about drilling, and that's important, but we have 3 percent of the world's oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world's oil. So what that means is that we can't simply drill our way out of the problem. And we're not going to be able to deal with the climate crisis if our only solution is to use more fossil fuels that create global warming. We're going to have to come up with alternatives, and that means that the United States government is working with the private sector to fund the kind of innovation that we can then export to countries like China that also need energy and are setting up one coal power plant a week. We've got to make sure that we're giving them the energy that they need or helping them to create the energy that they need.</p> </blockquote> <p>Later in the debate, Obama again stressed the scale of the climate and energy crisis, making clear that there are no easy fixes. His response was prompted by a questioner who asked the candidates what sacrifices they would ask every American to make \"to help restore the American dream and to get out of the economic morass that we're now in.\" </p> <p>Obama said:</p> <blockquote> <p>Let's take the example of energy, which we already spoke about. There is going to be the need for each and every one of us to start thinking about how we use energy. I believe in the need for increased oil production. We're going to have to explore new ways to get more oil, and that includes offshore drilling. It includes telling the oil companies, that currently have 68 million acres that they're not using, that either you use them or you lose them. We're going to have to develop clean coal technology and safe ways to store nuclear energy.</p> <p> But each and every one of us can start thinking about how can we save energy in our homes, in our buildings. And one of the things I want to do is make sure that we're providing incentives so that you can buy a fuel-efficient car that's made right here in the United States of America, not in Japan or South Korea, making sure that you are able to weatherize your home or make your business more fuel efficient. And that's going to require effort from each and every one of us.</p> </blockquote> <p>Overall, Tuesday night's debate seemed like one long discussion of the complex reality of energy markets, economic health, and national security. Pretty much the first sentence out of McCain's mouth, responding to a question about how to address the economic crisis, was to mention energy independence. \"I have a plan to fix this problem and it has got to do with energy independence,\" said McCain. \"We've got to stop sending $700 billion a year to countries that don't like us very much.\"</p> <p>Later in the debate, McCain again referred to energy independence as key to addressing the economic crisis, pointing specifically to offshore drilling and nuclear power. \"You're going to be examining our proposals tonight and in the future, and energy independence is a way to do that, is one of them,\" said McCain. \"Drilling offshore and nuclear power are two vital elements of that. And I've been supporting those and I know how to fix this economy, and eliminate our dependence on foreign oil, and stop sending $700 billion a year overseas.\"</p> <p>Obama, too, mentioned energy as a key factor in fixing the economy: \"We are going to have to deal with energy because we can't keep on borrowing from the Chinese and sending money to Saudi Arabia. We are mortgaging our children's future,\" said Obama. \"We've got to have a different energy plan.\"</p> <p>Moderator Tom Brokaw also asked the candidates about what their priorities will be in office: \"Health policies, energy policies, and entitlement reform -- what are going to be your priorities in what order? Which of those will be your highest priority your first year in office and which will follow in sequence?\"</p> <p>McCain responded first, arguing, \"I think you can work on all three at once, Tom.\" On the energy portion, he again touted nuclear energy, as well as renewables:</p> <blockquote> <p>We can work on nuclear power plants. Build a whole bunch of them, create millions of new jobs. We have to have all of the above, alternative fuels, wind, tide, solar, natural gas, clean coal technology. All of these things we can do as Americans and we can take on this mission and we can overcome it. My friends, some of this $700 billion ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>On that same question, Obama listed energy as his top priority:</p> <blockquote> <p>We're going to have to prioritize, just like a family has to prioritize ... Energy we have to deal with today, because you're paying $3.80 here in Nashville for gasoline, and it could go up. And it's a strain on your family budget, but it's also bad for our national security, because countries like Russia and Venezuela and, you know, in some cases, countries like Iran, are benefiting from higher oil prices.</p> <p> So we've got to deal with that right away. That's why I've called for an investment of $15 billion a year over 10 years. Our goal should be, in 10 years' time, we are free of dependence on Middle Eastern oil. And we can do it. Now, when JFK said we're going to the Moon in 10 years, nobody was sure how to do it, but we understood that if the American people make a decision to do something, it gets done. So that would be priority No. 1.</p> <p>McCain at one point went after Obama on the now well-trod issue of the 2005 energy bill. \"It was an energy bill on the floor of the Senate loaded down with goodies, billions for the oil companies, and it was sponsored by Bush and Cheney. You know who voted for it? You might never know. That one,\" he said, gesturing toward Obama. \"You know who voted against it? Me. I have fought time after time against these pork barrel -- these bills that come to the floor and they have all kinds of goodies and all kinds of things in them for everybody and they buy off the votes.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>McCain continued with another call for increasing offshore drilling:</p> <blockquote> <p><br> Also, on oil drilling, oil drilling offshore now is vital so that we can bridge the gap. We can bridge the gap between imported oil, which is a national security issue, as well as any other, and it will reduce the price of a barrel of oil, because when people know there's a greater supply, then the cost of that will go down. That's fundamental economics. We've got to drill offshore, my friends, and we've got to do it now, and we can do it.</p> </blockquote> <p>The final debate, scheduled for Oct. 15, is intended to focus on domestic policy issues. If, as expected, the economy remains the dominant issue in the campaign, we may very well see McCain and Obama return again and again to energy issues. The question will be whether the moderator (CBS's Bob Schieffer) can get them to drop their talking points in favor of a deeper discussion about the scope of the climate problem and the significant changes Americans need to make in how they consume energy.</p>",
  "<p>As we mentioned yesterday, the Tokyo Games Show isn't the only event happening this week. The <a href=\"http://www.virtualworldsforum.com/\">Virtual World's Forum</a> \u2013 unfortunately transposed from a full conference to a series of seminars due to an unfortunate incident in the venue (nothing to do with the event, mind) \u2013 is also taking place. And even though I'm in Japan, I tracked down some of the movers and shakers in the virtual worlds scene to find out the state of the industry in 2008. Today, inspired by a feature on kids' online spaces in Tech Weekly, I located Scott Arpajiann, co-founder of <a href=\"http://www.dizzywood.com/\">Dizzywood</a>, a children's virtual world based in San Francisco, to find out how they engage with their audience, and what happens when schools want to play too. <br><br><strong> What is Dizzywood?</strong><br> Dizzywood is a virtual world for kids with a focus on collaborative play. </p> <p><strong> Who's playing?</strong><br> Boys and girls, aged 8-12. Players are coming primarily from English-speaking countries. Currently the majority of the players are coming from the US. The second largest demographic (and one of the fastest growing) is the UK. </p> <p><strong> What do you have to think about when creating content for this market? For example, how demanding are they?</strong><br> The most important thing to consider when crafting a virtual world for children is safety. We spent a majority of our product development time building safeguards to ensure that kids would have fun in a completely safe and age-appropriate environment. Our system has sophisticated dictionary-based chat filtering and has live trained moderators watching over the site on a 24/7 basis. From a content standpoint, it's critical to have a constantly evolving product. Kids want to see new content on a very frequent basis. Part of our approach is to allow kids to create their own stories through our 'kit of parts' model. We provide props and setting, and kids are able to create their own stories, again in a completely safe way. </p> <p><strong> Why should they play when so much else is competing with their attentions?</strong><br> Kids have a lot of demands on their time, and increasingly have many choices on what to play. With that in mind, we designed Dizzywood to be vast, and the activities and missions change every day. Dizzywood challenges kids to complete activities that earn them special powers and other unusual rewards. It's a huge step up from earlier virtual worlds and games where the sole object was to accumulate coins. Kids feel a sense of accomplishment when they master a new game, skill or quest and because it's changing everyday, they keep coming back. Many of them have developed blogs and videos to share their knowledge and tips, which has also created a sense of community. </p> <p><strong> How are you engaging with kids in a different way from other children's virtual worlds?</strong><br> Dizzywood stands apart in two key ways. First, most activity in the world is based on the concept of collaborative play. A great deal of the world is social in nature, and kids learn quickly that working together towards shared goals is faster and more fun. For example, we held an event this Spring where kids could work together in-world to replant trees in Dizzywood's forest. We worked with the Arbor Day Foundation to plant a real tree on Earth for every virtual one planted on our site. Kids had fun re-planting Dizzywood, but also saw their their actions had a real-world benefit. This is very different from earlier worlds for kids which tend to be simple collections of mini-games and menu-driven solo activities. Second, Dizzywood is deep in story. We have a rich, detailed back-story that guides the experience. It's complete with quite a bit of conflict, a dastardly arch-villain, and several non-player characters placed throughout the world to help move the plot forward. Although everything move's at each child's own pace, the richness of the story helps provide a backdrop that keeps Dizzywood engaging and exciting for everyone. </p> <p><strong> What do you have to think about when creating a virtual world that's explicitly aimed at supporting education?</strong><br> We think of Dizzywood first and foremost as an entertainment site. Kids aren't going to spend their limited online time on a site unless it's fun and exciting. Our educational opportunities arise from the collaborative nature of the site as opposed to traditional curriculum. We aimed to differentiate our site with a level of depth that would allow children to explore, use their imagination and have the opportunity to cooperate with others. So far, it's working. We've been approached by several schools and youth organizations in the United States who want to embed Dizzywood into the classroom. As a result of working with teachers directly, we've been able to develop program objectives focusing on character pillars, which include honesty, respect, trustworthiness, citizenship, fairness, among other important values that have translated into a pilot program at an elementary school and a summer program at the YMCA. </p> <p><strong> Other projects - notably Castronova's Arden - fell over because they tried too hard to be pedagogically sound. How do you ensure that Dizzywood is fun?</strong><br> Our focus is entirely on fun. If we're not completely focused on creating an entertaining and engaging experience for kids, we're not going to succeed. We remind ourselves of that at all stages of our product development. We've aimed to make Dizzywood a place that has considerably more depth and value than the competition, but that never comes at a cost of good old-fashioned fun. </p> <p><strong>What is the virtual worlds community doing to ensure that kids' virtual worlds aren't a flash-in-the-pan fashion, and something that has longevity?</strong><br> The most important thing that the industry can do is to continue to innovate and find new ways for kids to engage. With Dizzywood, we've tried to do that by focusing on social activity. Kids are constantly working together on events and missions and learning the power of teamwork and cooperation as a source of fun. Although identity on Dizzywood is closely guarded for safety, the relationships that kids are forming on the site are very real. This type of experience hopefully creates an effect that leads to significantly deeper engagement and enjoyment. Based on what I've seen from other companies in this space, we'll continue to see even more innovation like this in the months to come as virtual worlds for kids move far beyond the simple menu-driven mini-game approach. </p> <p><strong>Which other online spaces for kids are you watching, out of interest rather than out of competition?</strong><br> Lego Universe. I don't think you can ever truly outgrow Legos, and I'm looking forward to seeing how they're able to move a very tactile experience into a virtual world setting. I'm also watching what Disney is doing, particularly with Pixie Hollow. With the acquisition of Club Penguin last year and the intention to launch many new virtual worlds in the next few, they're clearly the company to watch.</p> <p><em>Yesterday we featured fast-growing, gamer friendly Gaia Online. Tomorrow we're opening the doors of Habbo Hotel, the most successful Western social virtual world on the market</em></p>",
  "<p>A teenager shot 11-year-old Rhys Jones by mistake while aiming at rival gang members across a pub car park, Liverpool crown court head today at the start of the trial into the schoolboy's murder.</p> <p>Sean Mercer, 18, allegedly a member of the Croxteth Crew gang, denies murdering Rhys, who the court heard was shot in the back with a Smith and Wesson .455 revolver.</p> <p>At one stage during the trial, Rhys's mother, Melanie Jones, left the court in tears as the prosecution began to describe her son's last moments. </p> <p>The jury was shown a CCTV clip of Rhys crossing the car park of the Fir Tree pub and reacting to the sound of a bullet striking a container nearby. He turned to look at the container before being hit by another bullet. The 11-year-old fell to the ground where he later died in his mother's arms.</p> <p>The prosecutor, Neil Flewitt, QC, told the jury that Rhys had ended up \"walking into the line of fire\" on his way home from football practice on August 22.</p> <p>\"At almost exactly the same time as Rhys Jones walked into the car park, a hooded gunman on a bicycle approached the scene from the rear of the Fir Tree and took up a position on the grass in front of the fence running alongside the path on the far side of the car park,\" he said.</p> <p>The gunman fired three shots across the car park, one of which hit Rhys, killing him. The gunman was Mercer, from Croxteth, Liverpool, said Flewitt.</p> <p>According to Home Office pathologist, Dr Paul Johnson, Rhys was shot in the back, slightly above the left shoulder blade and the bullet exited from the front right side of his neck. </p> <p>When paramedics arrived, Rhys was already in cardiac arrest and was rushed to Alder Hey children's hospital but all attempts to resuscitate Rhys failed. </p> <p>Immediately after killing Rhys, Mercer \"set about distancing himself from the tragic events at the pub.</p> <p>\"He moved quickly to dispose of his clothing, his pedal cycle and the gun that he had used to such devastating effect,\" he said.</p> <p>Rhys was not Mercer's intended victim, the prosecutor added. \"On the contrary, it is the prosecution case that he was the innocent victim of a long-running feud between rival gangs operating in and around the area of the Fir Tree public house.\"</p> <p>Six co-defendants - Boy M, 16, James Yates, 20, Boy Q, 17, Melvin Coy, 25, Gary Kays, 25, from Liverpool, and Boy K, 17 - are charged with assisting an offender. For legal reasons, some are not named. Yates is also accused of possessing a firearm, and Boy K faces charges of possessing two firearms and ammunition.</p> <p>When Mercer was arrested, he claimed he was at Boy K's house but the prosecution said they had evidence which contradicts this.</p> <p>Boy K's mother said when Mercer called at the house, she was sure they left while Emmerdale was showing, and her son returned about 30 minutes later. </p> <p>\"So if [her] recollection is correct, Sean Mercer had left her house before Rhys Jones was killed and she does not support his alibi for the time of the murder,\" Flewitt said.</p> <p>Police also installed a hidden listening device inside the home address of James Yates, which the prosecution alleges recorded various \"significant conversations\" that took place in the days that followed.</p> <p>All defendants deny all the charges. Flewitt said all were members or associates of the Croxteth Crew, which has a rival gang in Norris Green known as either the Strand Gang or Nogga Dogs. Since 2004, there had been at least 70 cases of criminal damage and assault including the use of firearms associated with both gangs, he said.</p> <p>Flewitt said that until Rhys's killing the best-known manifestation of this feud had been the murder of Liam Smith, a member of the Strand Gang, who was shot dead outside Altcourse prison on August 23 2006. Four members of the Croxteth Crew were convicted in connection with this \u2013 three of murder and one of manslaughter.</p> <p>On the day that Rhys was killed, three young men - Wayne Brady and two others - who were Strand Gang members or associates \"left the relative safety of Norris Green and entered what, for them, was the hostile environment of Croxteth\". </p> <p>They were in the area because Brady wanted to borrow a bicycle from a friend who lived nearby.</p> <p>Flewitt said their presence brought Mercer to the Fir Tree pub and he was shooting at them when he killed Rhys.</p> <p>\"Sean Mercer's interest in Wayne Brady was not limited to general gang rivalry,\" Flewitt said. \"Rather evidence suggests there was some more personal animosity between them.\"</p> <p>A witness told police she knew Mercer and had said to her: \"Brady's gonna get it.\"</p> <p>He described the murder of Rhys Jones as \"yet another, and perhaps more tragic, example of the mindless and indiscriminate violence that is a feature of the rivalry between the Croxteth Crew and the Strand Gang\".</p> <p>The activities of the Croxteth Crew not only provided the setting for the murder of Rhys Jones but also led to the involvement of the other defendants, Flewitt said.</p> <p>\"It is the prosecution's case that the strength of the loyalty that existed among gang members and their associates explains the speed and enthusiasm with which [the six defendants] did all that they could to help Sean Mercer avoid responsibility for the dreadful events,\" he said.</p> <p>Flewitt said everyone who heard or read about the circumstances of Rhys Jones's death was both shocked and saddened at the loss of such a young life. \"You will, no doubt, share the dismay of all decent people that such an appalling event could take place at a busy public house and in broad daylight.\"</p> <p>Flewitt said Rhys Jones was born on September 27 1995 and was 11 years old when he died. He lived with his parents and older brother near the pub. Rhys had just completed his final year at Broad Square junior school in Croxteth and was looking forward to going to secondary school.</p> <p>\"Like many boys of his age, Rhys Jones loved football. He supported Everton and played for the under 12 team at the Fir Tree pub.\"</p> <p>The trial continues. It is expected to take six to eight weeks.</p>",
  "<p>The prospect of the American authorities following Britain's lead by taking ownership stakes in top banks has done little to cheer Wall Street, with sickly US stocks slipping exactly a year after hitting their all-time high.</p> <p>Officials say the US treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, is seriously considering a direct intervention to aid struggling institutions by pumping billions of dollars of capital into banks in return for equity stakes.</p> <p>Such a move would address fears that a $700bn (\u00a3407bn) government plan to buy banks' distressed mortgage-related assets may not be enough to re-establish confidence and to get banks lending to each other once again.</p> <p>Paulson alluded to the possibility at a press briefing yesterday without giving any details, saying that a bail-out bill approved by Congress provided \"broad, flexible authorities\" for his department to \"inject capital\" as well as to purchase banks' troubled assets.</p> <p>\"We will use all of the tools we've been given to maximum effectiveness, including strengthening the capitalisation of financial institutions of every size,\" he said.</p> <p>Citing treasury officials, the New York Times reported today that recapitalisation has become one of the most favoured options under discussion in Washington, where there has been mounting alarm at a week-long rout in share prices.</p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average opened this morning with a rise of 187 points but within 90 minutes, it had given up its gains and was in negative territory, slipping by 84 points to 9,168. The blue-chip index has lost 35% since touching a record high of 14,165 a year ago to the day.</p> <p>Among the big losers was America's biggest carmaker, General Motors, which saw its stock dive by 20% on ongoing fears about its cash position as sales of new vehicles suffer a steep decline.</p> <p>There was a glimmer of economic relief, however, as the weekly number of new claims for jobless benefits dropped by 20,000 to 478,000. The figure slipped back from a seven-year high but remains above 400,000 - a level considered by experts to be an indicator of a recession.</p> <p>In a note published today, Citigroup's global equity strategist Robert Buckland said corporate earnings were down 9% from their peak worldwide and are likely to fall by a further 15%. He said the profit cycle would not bottom until the end of 2009 at the earliest.</p> <p>\"The escalating financial crisis has battered world equity markets,\" said Buckland. \"The failure of the policy response so far means that the risks of a major global economic downturn are rising by the day.\"</p> <p>Any move by the US government to recapitalise the banking industry is likely to prove controversial in a nation which prides itself in its free-market ethos.</p> <p>William Isaac, a former chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Commission, said it could be necessary to address a \"serious crisis of confidence\". Already this year, 13 high-street banks have collapsed in the US, including big names such as Washington Mutual and California's IndyMac Bancorp.</p> <p>Critics have accused the authorities of inconsistent treatment with some allowed to go bust and others, including Wachovia, rescued through takeover deals arranged by the government.</p> <p>\"There's just a lack of confidence because we don't know which bank is going to go next,\" said Isaac. \"Banks we never thought would go, have gone.\"</p> <p>The credit crunch has prompted banks worldwide to write off $592bn of losses on the declining value of derivatives, credit-linked assets and mortgage-related securities. The IMF expects these losses to double to $1.4 trillion. But according to the financial data firm Bloomberg, banks have only raise $442.5bn of new capital to make up for their losses.</p>",
  "<p>The International Monetary Fund has drawn up emergency plans to bail out governments affected by the financial crisis, after warning yesterday that no country would be immune from the ripple effects of the credit crunch.</p> <p>Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the Fund's managing director, said it could make \"hundreds of billions of dollars\" available to either rich countries in the west, or to developing nations.</p> <p>Amid fears that the extreme turbulence of the past month will push governments to the brink of financial collapse, Strauss-Kahn said he had asked the Fund's board to activate its fast-track loan procedure.</p> <p>Strauss-Kahn said, \"we are ready to answer any demand from a country facing problems.\" </p> <p>He added that the Fund had not lent during the past five years, and therefore had a sizeable war chest available. Any country seeking financial assistance will face less stringent conditions than normally apply to governments in trouble. \"We are not going to take weeks and months to design a programme; it will take two weeks at most,\" Strauss-Kahn said.</p> <p>However, anti-poverty campaigners warned that the hurdles to receiving the IMF's help might still be too high. </p> <p>\"No one could accuse the Fund of being asleep at the wheel,\" said Marita Hutjes, Oxfam International spokesperson. \"It is coming up quickly with money to help countries cope. But for the poorest countries, it's still not doing it right. They can't borrow as much as they'll need, and most of that money will be subject to high numbers of conditions.\"</p> <p>Speaking on the eve of the Fund's Annual Meetings in Washington, Strauss-Kahn repeatedly warned that \"no country is immune\", from the credit crunch, adding that firms and consumers in emerging countries were already seeing loans become more expensive.</p> <p>He pointed to a map showing the progress of \"financial global warming\", since 2006. Two years ago, only a handful of countries were affected by financial problems; but they have now spread throughout the globe.</p> <p>He said the Fund had been rightly pessimistic six months ago about the scale of the financial problems, and been proved right; but it now expected the situation to improve by the end of next year. \"It's a message of hope: the crisis is serious, the crisis is protracted; but the second half of 2009 will be the beginning of recovery. It will be slow,\" he said.</p> <p>The IMF also called for better coordination of national responses to the ongoing turmoil, and Strauss-Kahn singled out the chaotic actions in Europe for criticisms. \"I urge European countries to work together: there is no domestic solution to a crisis like this. All lonely actions have to be avoided, if not condemned.\"</p>",
  "<p>Taking a brief moment off from my day of Lauren Bacall worship (she said, as you may have heard, that Tom Cruise is something like a maniac), I discover that another golden oldie has been expressing controversial views.</p> <p>I refer, of course, to Noel Gallagher of Oasis, who has said the following on a Dutch and Belgian TV show:</p> <blockquote> <p>You know England is not that fucking great, as anybody'll tell you. To live in England is a fucking shithole, to be honest. Well, look at it, fucking dump!</p> </blockquote> <p>Tempting as it is to recall the words of Boris Johnson's sometime advisor James McGrath - who suggested certain members of society could always leave the UK if they weren't happy here - and apply it, in this case, to Noel rather than, as McGrath appeared to be suggesting, black people, let's hear Noel out.</p> <p>He doesn't like:<br>Tourism (too many), crime (too much), traffic (too much), pollution (too much) ...<br>He also doesn't like pop stars gushing about one another.</p> <p>He does, however, like:<br>His girlfriend, his kids, English tea and, best of all, global warming, which he describes as \"brilliant\".</p> <p>Well, that's the Gallagher polemic for today.

  "<p>A unique proposal to protect one of the world's most biodiverse places from oil drilling is facing a looming deadline without any funding in place. </p> <p>The Ecuadorian government has said it is prepared to keep hundreds of millions of barrels of heavy crude oil in the ground, but in return it wants the international community to compensate it at the level of $350m (\u00a3202m) a year for a decade. </p> <p>The deadline \u2013 already postponed twice \u2013 is in December. While there has been political support from Spain, Germany and Norway, as yet there has been little in the way of hard cash.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.ecuador-travel.net/biodiversity.parks.yasuni.htm\">Yasuni national park</a> in Ecuador lies at the intersection of the Amazon, the Andes and the equator and spans almost a million hectares of primary rainforest. It is home to indigenous tribes, who wish to be left in isolation, and an extraordinary array of wildlife and plants, much of it endangered. Avoiding the oil extraction would also prevent the release of an estimated 100m tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere.</p> <p>Environmentalists believe the innovative proposal has the potential to be a model for how developing countries manage their environments and the global fight against climate change.</p> <p>Nelson Torres, the Ecuadorian deputy ambassador to the UK, described it as a \"third way of management of climate change\" and said that it would \"lay the groundwork for energy transformation globally\". Anita Rivas, the indigenous mayor of Orellana, where Yasuni is located said: \"It's a brave proposal, a unique proposal.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://sef.umd.edu/sef2007.html\">Ishpingo Tambococha Tiputini</a> (ITT) field block lies in the south of Yasuni park, within an area officially designated in 1999 as an \"untouchable zone\" \u2013 a safe haven for those indigenous people who have chosen to live in isolation. The compensation package the Ecuadorian government is demanding is designed to deliver half the income that would accrue if the oil was extracted, over a period equating to the likely lifetime of the field.</p> <p>The government has shown a greater will than previous administrations to protect indigenous people and the environment. Last week, the nation overwhelmingly passed a constitution that granted Ecuador's tropical forests, islands, rivers and air similar legal rights to those normally granted to humans. But the president, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6187364.stm\">Rafael Correa</a>, is faced with the harsh economic reality that 70% of the country's income comes from oil and 38% of people in the South American republic live below the poverty line. </p> <p>In recent years, drilling has been allowed up to the boundaries of the \"untouchable zone\" but the region has seen little of the economic benefits, with a poverty rate in Orellana far higher than the national average. </p> <p>A statement from Penti Baihua, a member of the Huaorani tribe, said oil companies had contaminated water, soil and air, scared away animals, and brought diseases that had made members of their families ill and even killed them. </p> <p>\"The oil must stay in the ground in the ITT and the [untouchable] zone because it is our home. If the oil companies destroy all of the Yasuni, where will we live?\" he said. </p> <p>There is widespread support for drilling to be blocked in the ITT but not everyone agrees with the government's method. The meeting in London was organised by the <a href=\"http://www.yasunigreengold.org/\">Yasuni Green Gold campaign</a> to launch its book of the same name which highlights the park's vast array of plants and animals, believed to have resulted because the area did not freeze over during the last ice age. </p> <p>The campaign director and joint author of the book, Gin\u00e9s Haro Pastor, emphasised that while he supported financial help for Ecuador's development he felt it should be separated from the issue of the Yasuni. </p> <p>Yasuni Green Gold wants an unconditional commitment from the government not to drill oil in the untouchable zone regardless of financial pledges and wants it to scrap the idea of a deadline altogether. </p> <p>Environmental campaigner Tony Juniper, formerly executive director of Friends of the Earth, is enthusiastic about the concept of developing countries being compensated for protecting the environment. He believes taxes, including a small duty on foreign currency trades, could raise the tens of billions of pounds needed to replicate the Ecuadorian scheme around the world. </p> <p>But, he added, there were issues that needed to be ironed out, including whether countries should be able to seek compensation in respect of rainforest they had previously designated as protected, and whether wealthy nations such as Saudi Arabia and Russia should be able to claim cash for not extracting oil.</p>",
  "<p>Drivers' groups today accused petrol retailers of ripping off motorists by not lowering prices at the pumps despite <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/oil\">oil</a> having tumbled from its record high price level in July.</p> <p>But motorists could receive some cheer in the run-up to Christmas. Experts believe pump prices will fall as demand for fuel wanes in the face of recession fears and cutbacks on spending.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/06/oil.consumeraffairs\">Oil prices have now fallen to below $90 per barrel</a> on the back of fears over the global economy. Although this is still high by historical standards, it is the lowest level for nearly a year and down almost 40% since the all-time high above $140 set in July. </p> <p>However, petrol prices have only fallen by 10p a litre, or 9%, since then and \"postcode lotteries\" across the country are seeing some filling stations selling up to 4p a litre more than they should.</p> <p>This problem is highlighted particularly in Bracknell, Berkshire - UK headquarters of German car-maker, BMW, and Reading. Out of the supermarket petrol retailers, only Morrisons and Asda have recently slashed their prices nationally, by around 4p each.</p> <p>\"Other supermarkets are charging what they can get away with,\" said Luke Bosdet, spokesman for the AA. </p> <p>This means in Reading, where an Asda is located, forecourt prices are 4p lower than in Bracknell - equivalent to \u00a32 less on every tank that is filled up.</p> <p>Drivers are now engaged in what the AA is calling a \"fuel price lottery\" with the price they pay dependent on whether they have a supermarket near them or not.</p> <p>Big retailers like Shell and BP deny profiteering. BP said it reviewed its pricing policy on a day-to-day basis and set levels according to local markets, but declined to say how or when prices might fall.</p> <p>On average, petrol prices are now 109.38p, down from the record high of 119.9p in July. Falls in oil prices usually take six to eight weeks to filter down to forecourts so there is the possibility that motorists may enjoy lower prices at the pump soon. However, this could be threatened if the Organisation for Petroleum Exporting Countries slashes supplies to the west to keep oil prices artificially high, as Libya called for this week.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Bosdet says the 10p drop so far is \"nothing to be sniffed at\" since it has brought at an extra \u00a36.8m a day to the high street in potential consumer spending.</p> <p>But he acknowledged that with utility and grocery bills still remaining high, a few more pence off the price of petrol would bring immense relief for drivers and households.</p> <p>Compared to this time last year, when the average price of petrol was 97.54p per litre, motorists are paying \u00a35.92 more to refill, the AA said.</p> <p>The motoring group plans on urging the chancellor to commit to a fuel duty freeze in his pre-budget report until the several of the clouds over the economy clear.</p>",
  "<p>Invest in spade manufacturers. That's my hot tip for those of you looking for a punt during these uncertain times. For this is surely a wonderful time to be burying bad news.</p> <p>There was certainly something of the <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/byers/page/0,11320,630499,00.html\">Jo Moore's</a> about today's announcement by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/03/geoffhoon.labour\">Geoff Hoon</a>, the fresh-off-the-carousel transport secretary, that Stansted airport is to be given the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/09/baa.theairlineindustry\">go-ahead to expand</a> its passenger capacity. Would he have dared do so at any other time given that it was just 72 hours ago that the government's <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/climatechange/uk/legislation/committee/index.htm\">committee on climate change</a>, chaired by Lord Turner (some week he's having what with his other job at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/may/30/alistairdarling.economy\">FSA</a>), said that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/07/carbon.emissions.targets\">UK's carbon reduction target for 2050</a> should be raised from 60% to 80% and include shipping and aviation?</p> <p>Airport expansion seems to make about as much sense this week as looking for good savings deals in Iceland. Even if you put climate change concerns aside \u2013 a near-impossible ask when it comes to airports, I admit \u2013 then airport expansion still seems to be a dud. With airlines going out of business by the week due to high fuel costs, and consumers pulling up the drawbridge on their spending (which, presumably, will curtail the urge to pop to Europe by plane for the weekend), the <a href=\"http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/aviation/atf/\">growth predictions</a> made by the aviation industry \u2013 and lapped up by the present government \u2013 now seem to be more than a little wide of the mark. The current economic situation is actually presenting the government with the perfect opportunity to gracefully retreat from its unpopular and unwise airport expansion plans \u2013 and yet it pushes on like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/jul/01/topstories3.military\">Douglas Haig at the Somme</a>. The plans for Stansted and Heathrow's third runway should really be dead in the water by now \u2013 for example, how and with whom is <a href=\"http://www.baa.com/\">BAA</a> now going to raise the funds for these projects? \u2013 but still they refuse to whither. I wonder if <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/03/climatechange.energy\">Ed Miliband</a>, as the new secretary of state for climate change and energy, was even involved in the decision. To be honest, it tells us much about the government's true convictions on climate change whether he was or he wasn't involved.</p> <p>My bet is that the third runway at Heathrow really must now be a lost cause for its ever-dwindling number of supporters. The tide has now almost fully turned against it \u2013 the politics, the economics, the environment. Stansted's expansion is very different because it doesn't require new asphalt to be laid, just an increase in the number of flights using its current runway. But never content, its owner BAA still pushes on with its predict-and-provide pleas for a second runway. If any good is to come out of the turbulence of recent weeks it will be that such plans will now have to make an urgent forced landing.</p>",
  "<p>Zimbabwe's official inflation rate has surged to 231,000,000% as the opposition appealed to South Africa's former president, Thabo Mbeki, to rescue the historic power-sharing deal he brokered last month. </p> <p>With the economy continuing its rapid collapse and no end in sight to the political deadlock, the World Food Programme today launched an appeal to feed 5 million Zimbabweans. It said that more than 80% of the country's population was living on less than \u00a31 a day and nearly half is chronically malnourished.</p> <p>The latest official inflation rate, for July, is twenty times higher than a month earlier. Independent economists, who have accurately estimated the true rate in the past, say that inflation this month will run into the trillions.</p> <p>That has forced the government to allow shops this week to begin accepting US dollars and South African rand because the Zimbabwean dollar is now all but worthless.</p> <p>The latest inflation figures will increase pressure on the country's president, Robert Mugabe to stop stalling over the composition of a new power-sharing government with the prime minister designate, Morgan Tsvangirai. The president is demanding security ministries such as the army and police as well as the finance portfolio even though foreign donors have made it clear that there will be no aid to revive the economy unless that falls under Tsvangirai's control.</p> <p>Tsvangirai said today that the talks were deadlocked and called for Mbeki to intervene. \"We have asked him to come over and he has said he will come over,\" he said.</p> <p>But Tsvangirai said he retained confidence in the agreement. \"We are confident about the potential of the deal,\" he said. \"In the process of implementation, we have hit an impasse but not on fundamental contents of the deal.</p> <p>\"Unfortunately no progress has been made ... to bring the Zimbabwean people to the beginning of the path of recovery. Instead the economic crisis has worsened. We now live in an environment characterised by hunger, starvation, and we are days away from seeing people dropping dead on the streets.\"</p> <p>Mugabe only signed what he called a \"humiliating\" agreement surrendering many of his powers because his government has no solution to the problems afflicting Zimbabwe, and that has not changed.</p> <p>Its attempt to curb inflation with enforced price reductions only drove trade on to the black market.</p> <p>The central bank removed 10 zeros from the national currency in August after rapid devaluation forced it to print Z$100bn notes that were worth only about 8p on the street when they were scrapped.</p> <p>But the new currency continued the free fall as it dropped from about Z$100 to the pound two months ago to Z$2m to the pound before the government blocked electronic bank transfers last week.</p> <p>Severe cash shortages, because the government cannot afford to print bank notes to keep pace with inflation, had meant that many people could at least use bank accounts as a means of payment using a parallel market rate. But that lifeline has now been cut.</p> <p>The central bank said the transfers were used for illicit exchange deals and to overprice goods. \"We have no option but to take this drastic measure in order to maintain sanity in the financial system,\" said the central bank governor, Gideon Gono.</p>",
  "<p>This week, Noises off has birthday cake for everyone. Yes, it has been exactly a year since Kelly Nestruck <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/theatreblog/2007/oct/09/fromthetheatreblogs\">gave birth to this column</a>, which has, for the last 12 months, been charging round the blogosphere like a hyperactive toddler. Yet this is not the only blogday that the web has seen recently. <a href=\"http://www.georgehunka.com/blog/index.cgi/2008/09/30#archives_081001\">George Hunka</a> has recently been looking back over a whopping five years of his site which he initially christened Superfluities and then renamed <a href=\"http://www.georgehunka.com/blog/index.cgi/2008/09/30#archives_081001\">Superfluities Redux</a>. </p> <p>This has been a major project for Hunka, and as he says: \"Superfluities has changed my life in countless ways ... not least in that it has brought to me a few new friends who have broadened my world and my imaginative life, and whose acquaintance I cherish ... Some of them I haven't met in person. I hope to do so one day, though this in no way lessens the tremendous affection and regard I hold for them already; those days on which I find their emails in my inbox are a little brighter than all the rest. And I find as my conceptions and reconceptions of theatre and drama becoming more and more radical, these friends have become closer and closer (even if they agree or disagree with what I write here, find it more or less valid), rendering the dividing lines between the art of theatre, the fashioning of self and the conduct of life more and more invisible.\" </p> <p>Moving away from all this anniversary-led nostalgia, Australian blogger <a href=\"http://theatrenotes.blogspot.com/2008/10/getting-heard-realpolitik-of-arts.html\">Alison Croggon</a> has written a very interesting piece about the need for good administrators in the arts. In a review of a recently published paper about arts advocacy she argues that the German novelist and intellectual Robert Musil \"observed once that if there was to be real social change of any kind, what was required more than anything else was not idealists nor intellectuals, but managers: those who knew the nuts and bolts of creating and maintaining organisations, and understood how to change organisational structures\". </p> <p>Croggon acknowledges that this is often an unpopular view amongst artists \u2013 given how much money can be end up being spent on admin rather than actual art \u2013 but she goes on to say \"One of the most useful weapons in an artist's survival arsenal is a practical understanding of how cultural policy and funding work, not from the narrow view of a practitioner applying cap-in-hand for the advantage of his or her project or organisation, but from the wider perspective of the place of culture in political and financial economies. This understanding is often rare among artists, not least because practitioners are too busy practising to have the time to read government reports.\"</p> <p>While we're hanging out down under with Croggon, I wanted to take a few moments to look at some of the other blogs that reside in that part of the Southern hemisphere. Many of them are currently awash with talk of this year's Melbourne Fringe festival. <a href=\"http://richard_watts.blogspot.com/2008/09/one-day-to-go-until-melbourne-fringe.html\">Richard Watts</a> is excited by this festival because \"unlike other Fringe festivals around the planet, which predominantly feature interstate (hello Adelaide) or international guests (yes Edinburgh, I'm looking at you), the Melbourne Fringe consists almost entirely of shows and exhibitions and indefinable creative strangeness created by Melbourne artists.\" </p> <p>To get a sense of the kind of work showcased there you could drop in at either the <a href=\"http://atmosphericharmoniesforloners.blogspot.com/\">Born Dancin'</a>, <a href=\"http://onstagemelbourne.blogspot.com/\">On Stage and Walls</a>, or <a href=\"http://longsentencenosuggestions.blogspot.com/\">Long Sentences No Suggestions</a> blogs for reviews of the festivals latest offerings. <br>Of course, no festival would be complete without a good bit of controversy. As the <a href=\"http://misonou.livejournal.com/\">Mono no Aware</a> blog points out, this has come about as a result of David Tyndall, the artistic director of Dancehouse, laying into a review in The Age newspaper of one of his shows. His critique of the critique is sharp and well worth a look. </p> <p>Finally, Dominic Cavendish on the <a href=\"http://www.theatrevoice.com/blog/index.php/2008/10/06/market-failure-on-a-colossal-scale/\">Theatre Voice</a> blog is asking why theatre is failing to tackle to the credit crunch: \"Where are the plays confronting the massive global meltdown now haunting the waking hours, and nightmares, of millions of people? Where, more to the point, WERE the plays that scented something seriously awry in the financial markets?\" </p> <p>Cavendish is right that there has been little yet on our stages that tackles this issue head on. But perhaps the theatre works better as a critic of what is past than a prophet of what is to come. If so, then maybe next year will finally see the market taking centre stage - assuming, of course, that any <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2008/10/06/btculture106.xml\">theatres remain open</a>.</p>",
  "<p>The current global financial crisis is commonly known as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">credit crunch</a>, as lending between banks has all but frozen, and credit made available to consumers and businesses is being squeezed.</p>",
  "<p>A degree of calm returned to the world's stockmarkets today following yesterday's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/creditcrunch.marketturmoil1\">coordinated global rate cut</a>.</p> <p>In London, the FTSE 100 jumped more than 3% at one stage this morning to a high of 4512, up 145 points, and was up 82 points mid-afternoon. Banks continued to recover following <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/creditcrunch.marketturmoil1\">the UK goverment's \u00a3500bn rescue plan</a> announced yesterday, with shares in HBOS up 35% and Royal Bank of Scotland 15% higher.</p> <p>Wall Street staged a rally after yesterday's 2% fall of the Dow Jones industrial average. The Dow rose 154 points to 9412 points in early trading, a gain of 1.6%. The US treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, signalled last night that the government could invest in banks to help restore confidence in the sector.</p> <p>\"There's a little bit of calm after what's been a very volatile week so far,\" said Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec. \"There's some realisation that world governments are serious about tackling the problems they find in front of them.\" But he added: \"We're unlikely to be entering a stable period; there's still a lot of nerves in markets.\"</p> <p>But the banks were still reluctant to lend to each other despite yesterday's half-point reduction in the Bank of England's base rate to 4.5%. Three-month sterling Libor - the rate which banks charge each other for short-term loans - rose to 6.28% this morning from 6.27% yesterday, with other indicators showing that financial firms are still hoarding cash.</p> <p>The financial crisis continued to ripple across Europe this morning. All share trading in Iceland was suspended. Iceland, which has been hit hard by the financial crisis, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/09/banking.iceland\">took control of the country's biggest bank Kaupthing</a>. Iceland has now brought most of its banking sector under state control. Kaupthing's board has resigned.</p> <p>European stocks recovered from heavy losses in recent days, with Germany's Dax rising 1.5% and France's CAC 40 up 2.6% this afternoon. Troubled financial group Dexia jumped 25% after France, Belgium and Luxembourg announced they had agreed to provide state guarantees to help it borrow.</p> <p>Speaking after the concerted interest rate cuts announced yesterday by the world's major central banks, Paulson appeared to suggest that the US treasury may follow the UK's lead by taking stakes in many US banks.</p> <p>\"We will use all of the tools we've been given to maximum effectiveness, including strengthening the capitalisation of financial institutions of every size,\" he told a news conference.</p> <p>Striking a cautious tone that sent shares sliding on Wall Street last night, Paulson cautioned the US rescue plan will not save all firms. \"One thing we must recognise - even with the new treasury authorities, some financial institutions will fail,\" he said, adding that regulators will take measures to limit the systemic risk from any single bank failure.</p> <p>Asian central banks have now joined in yesterday's unprecedented global rate cut. South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan all lowered their benchmark interest rates by a quarter point overnight. This followed half-point cuts from the Bank of England, the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and other European central banks. </p> <p>Asian stockmarkets were mixed overnight, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng rising 3.3% and shares in Seoul up 0.6%, while Taiwan's index dropped 1.45%.</p> <p>The Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, said his government was prepared to buy stakes in failing banks while waiving voting rights. Italy has been largely shielded from the global financial turmoil because its banking sector is mostly retail, relying on savers' deposits rather than money markets. </p> <p>Germany may have to consider nationalising its banks if the crisis continues to worsen, finance minister Peer Steinbrueck told a newspaper. </p> <p>\"Just lowering interest rates would be far from sufficient in the current situation,\" said Amar Gill at CLSA in Singapore. \"The main problem now is that banks are not lending to weaker banks, and the overall banking system is not lending to corporates.\" </p> <p>The Bank of Japan did not take part in the coordinated rate cuts as its interest rates are already near zero, but the country's finance minister, Shoichi Nakagawa, welcomed the move. The Nikkei index closed down 0.5% at 9,157.</p>",
  "<p>Councils could be at risk of losing a total of more than \u00a31bn because of the collapse of Icelandic banks, the Tories claimed today.</p> <p>Eric Pickles, the shadow communities secretary, produced the figure ahead of a meeting this afternoon between ministers and members of the Local Government Association to discuss the problem.</p> <p>The BBC said this afternoon that it had already identified more than 80 councils and police authorities that between them could lose more than \u00a3700m. </p> <p>One authority - Kent county council - has \u00a350m deposited in Icelandic banks.</p> <p>In an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Pickles said total losses \"could be \u00a31bn or [they] could be more\".</p> <p>He went on: \"I know of at least two district councils that have \u00a39m and \u00a311m each [deposited in Icelandic banks] and that's not far short of three-quarters of their total annual budget excluding housing.\"</p> <p>Later Pickles issued a statement saying: \"The government is continuing to dither in the face of a worsening problem. Hour by hour, it is clear that more and more councils have been exposed to the meltdown in Iceland's banks.</p> <p>\"Councils have literally billions on deposit. If they now all panic, pull their money out and put it in the safest option like government bonds, there will be adverse consequences. The withdrawal of a huge amount of money from the banking system will destabilise it further and harm liquidity.\"</p> <p>Today the prime minister's official spokesman said the government was willing to discuss the problem with local authorities \"to see if we can find a way though\".</p> <p>He said: \"The government does understand the situation that they [the councils] are in. We have had difficulties getting complete clarity from the Icelandic authorities for all UK depositors.\"</p> <p>The spokesman said the government would like to find \"a constructive and cooperative\" way forward with Iceland, but he added: \"As the Local Government Association themselves have said this will have no impact on local services.\"</p> <p>Pressed on whether the government would extend its guarantee to the Icelandic banks, the spokesman said: \"We are trying to extract information from them [the Icelandic authorities] about the scale of the deposits. We need to established what the facts are.\"</p> <p>Treasury ministers Stephen Timms and Ian Pearson and local government minister John Healey were meeting the LGA this afternoon to discuss the situation.</p> <p>Mark Wallace, campaign director at the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: \"People will be shocked that the councils had this money stashed away in the first place.</p> <p>\"The fact that they have invested this money and seem to have lost it is even more shocking and is sadly yet another reminder of the poor financial management in local councils.\"</p> <p>But Edward Welsh, of the LGA, insisted councils acted along \"prudent lines\" by spreading their money across several financial institutions at home and abroad. </p> <p>Welsh told BBC Breakfast: \"Councils are large employers, they have large wage bills to pay off, they collect large amounts of money in council tax.</p> <p>\"The reason why this money has been put in these banks is to try to reduce risk by putting their money in as many banks as possible.</p> <p>\"In a world where the global banking system is under such enormous pressure, it's perhaps not surprising that a council has been caught out in this way.\"</p> <p>He said councils follow government guidance and use independent financial advice but the financial \"world is changing as we speak\".</p> <p>He said of the money: \"We don't know it's lost, we know it's at risk. That's why we are speaking to the Treasury, that's why we want to find out what we can do to try and get that money back.\"</p> <p>The LGA has urged the government to guarantee them against any losses.</p> <p>The chancellor, Alistair Darling, announced yesterday he would protect the savings of private investors in Icelandic banks.</p> <p>He said local authorities were \"more of an informed investor\".</p> <p>\"But this situation is evolving, we are trying to sort the matter out with the Icelandic government,\" he said</p> <p>Brown promised legal action against the Icelandic authorities to recover the funds.</p> <p>The Conservatives said town halls faced a \"massive financial shock\", threatening council tax hikes or cuts in local services.</p> <p>The LGA insisted that frontline services should not be affected by any losses.</p> <p>London public authorities are thought to face exposure of around \u00a3200m, according the umbrella organisation London Councils.</p> <p>The LGA deputy chief executive, John Ransford, said: \"This is a very fast-moving situation. It is changing all the time, and we need to talk to government to make sure we act sensibly in the interests of local taxpayers and making sure services are preserved.</p> <p>\"This is public money - it's your money and my money - we need to treat this in exactly the same way as individual investors in these banks.\"</p>",
  "<p>Tony Blair once said that the government was best when it was boldest. Gordon Brown is \u2013 finally \u2013 heeding that advice. The <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/09/economy.alistairdarling1\">government's three-pronged plan</a> to shore up Britain's banking system is bold and right. It is our best hope of pacifying the financial panic, getting credit flowing through the economy again and thus avoiding a 1930s-style depression.</p> <p>The Bank of England's half-point cut in interest rates is also welcome, particularly since it was <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/10/09/business/09fed.php\">coordinated</a> with other central banks. It signals that the US and Europe are finally acting together to tackle the global financial crisis. But a larger cut is needed soon: at 4.5%, UK interest rates are still far too high. </p> <p>The bigger challenge is to get banks lending again \u2013 to each other, to companies and to individuals. They need enough cash to conduct their day-to-day operations; secure access to medium-term funding; and extra long-term capital to provide a cushion against bad debts and allow them to lend to creditworthy borrowers.</p> <p>The government's plan addresses all three of these needs. The Bank of England will supply \u00a3200bn in short-term funding; the government will underwrite \u00a3250bn of medium-term finance; and it will also inject \u00a325bn in long-term capital initially \u2013 and perhaps up to \u00a350bn in total \u2013 in the form of preference shares that pay a fixed return and protect taxpayers' investment. </p> <p>Headline writers may describe the government plan as a \u00a3500bn bail-out, but that is completely misleading. The \u00a3200bn consists of short-term secured loans; the \u00a3250bn is a form of insurance, for which the government will be paid a fee; and the \u00a350bn is an investment that pays a return. This is not money for nothing. </p> <p>And while it is certainly true that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/08/creditcrunch.banking\">taxpayers' money is at risk</a>, we will also share in the upside when the banks recover \u2013 as they are much more likely to do thanks to the government's intervention. Most importantly, the risk of doing nothing \u2013 or of continuing to do too little, too late \u2013 is far greater. If the banks went under, so would businesses and jobs. By keeping the UK banking system afloat, the government \u2013 acting on behalf of all of us \u2013 is giving the economy a life raft. </p> <p>Many of the details of the government's plan are still unclear. Ideally, the preference shares should pay a hefty interest rate to properly compensate taxpayers and give banks an incentive to seek private financing if and when they can. Taxpayers' money should also come with strings attached, such as guarantees that banks will use the extra capital to lend to small businesses and individuals rather than pay extravagant dividends and unjustified bonuses. And, of course, the plan must be implemented speedily and efficiently.</p> <p>We are by no means out of the woods yet. Global financial markets are in turmoil; other governments need to follow Britain's bold lead soon. The UK economy has many other weaknesses: consumers are overladen with debt, often secured against housing that remains overpriced; unemployment is rising; food and energy prices remain painfully high; and the global gloom is hardly auspicious for exporters, despite the fillip of a weaker currency. What's more, the banking rescue package will swell the government's already-large deficit \u2013 although borrowing to invest in banks need not increase the national debt in the long term. But while 2009 will no doubt be unpleasant, the government's actions should stave off economic collapse. Amid all the gloom, that is certainly good news.</p>",
  "<p>With storm clouds <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/creditcrunch.usa\">this dark</a>, it is hard to see a silver lining. Perhaps with uncharacteristic optimism, I see three. </p> <p>First, the denial is over. Leaders now understand the gravity and worldwide scope of the crisis. Second, central banks are now pulling out all the stops, as they should. Even the European Central Bank has <a href=\"http://www.ecb.int/press/pr/date/2008/html/pr081008.en.html\">acknowledged</a> that inflation is yesterday's problem. Third, there is now a willingness to use taxpayer funds to recapitalise the banks. The UK has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/marketturmoil.creditcrunch\">shown the way</a>. The US needs to abandon its lengthy preparations for reverse auctions of toxic assets and use the $700bn of the recently passed financial rescue plan to recapitalise its banks. There should be enough wiggle room under the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/03/creditcrunch.useconomy2\">Tarp</a> to do this if the treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, has the courage.</p> <p>But governments now need to recognise that they have not just a financial crisis but an economic crisis on their hands. We are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/09/imf.globalrecession\">well past the point</a> where it makes sense to speak of the possibility or even the unavoidability of recession. There is a very high probability now of the most serious global recession in our lifetimes. Consumer confidence is in tatters. Firms, their access to credit having been disrupted, have not just stopped investing but are finding it difficult to meet payroll. The crisis has decisively moved from Wall Street to Main Street. The process is further along in the US and the UK because financial problems were later to surface in other countries. But the recession is now global. So too, soon enough, will be realisation.</p> <p>What is no longer simply a financial crisis cannot be fixed by financial interventions alone. It cannot be fixed by more <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/interestrates.banking\">interest rate cuts</a> because interest rates on safe assets have been pushed pretty much as low as they can go. With consumption and investment both collapsing and only extra-terrestrials to sell additional exports to, there is only one element of global demand left. That's government spending. It is time, in other words, to think about aggressively using fiscal policy. </p> <p>One can imagine the alarm with which this recommendation will be received. The US deficit is already <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=a.kAXACVdHTI&amp;refer=home\">rising steeply</a>, what with the Tarp, the AIG rescue, Fannie and Freddie, not to mention social security, Medicare and Medicaid down the road. European countries have uncomfortably high debts and the kind of gloomy demographics that make even existing debts painful to service. But these are problems for tomorrow. The imperative for today is to stabilise the economy. And fiscal policy is the only instrument left for doing this.</p> <p>Fiscal initiatives will have to be large to succeed in stabilising an economy in freefall. In the US case, we are talking 5% of GDP, or $700bn (there's that number again). This means that the US deficit may be closer to $2tn than $1tn next year. But desperate times require desperate measures.</p> <p>The problem with using fiscal policy in a financial crisis, as any emerging market official will tell you, is that it may do more to frighten than reassure investors. Worried that the government's big budget deficits will ultimately have to be financed by printing central bank money, investors may flee the country, causing its currency to crash and creating even more serious financial problems. </p> <p>Of course, if all governments apply fiscal stimulus at the same time, there is then no reason for investors to flee in any particular direction. There is an urgent need, in other words, for coordinated fiscal (and not just monetary) action. </p> <p>In the US, we need an income tax cut to put money in the pockets of consumers and an investment tax credit to get corporate spending going again. Intervening in the housing market \u2013 buying up mortgages <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2008/10/07/mccain-announces-homeownership-resurgence-plan/\">a la John McCain</a> \u2013 would be less effective, for this is no longer a housing crisis; it is now a wider consumption and investment crisis. Other countries might prefer a different mix of emergency tax cuts. But they need to act together. </p> <p>The relevant finance ministers will meet in Washington at the end of this week. Will they be ready to grasp the nettle?</p>",

  "<p>Yesterday was another strange day in the election race: the latest developments in the global financial crisis once again rendered the battle between the candidates very much a secondary story. But the day after the debate in Nashville - awarded to Barack Obama by voters and pundits alike - both men and their running-mates were campaigning hard: Obama to consolidate his lead in the polls, and John McCain, despite the defeated noises coming from many conservative commentators, to devise a strategy for a comeback.</p> <p>What that comeback might involve didn't seem at all clear, though. Rather than going unremittingly negative, McCain's advisers were seeking to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/09/uselections2008.johnmccain\">refocus the campaign</a> on a narrow field of battleground states, suggesting a best-case scenario for the Republicans of a very slim victory over Obama,\" Ewen MacAskill and Suzanne Goldenberg write in today's Guardian. </p> <p>The McCain camp, they add, also signalled an attempt to return to an issues-based campaign, focused on the economy and his mortgage buyout plan, only days after announcing a \"gloves off\" attack on Obama's character and his former associations in Chicago. Obama, meanwhile, finds himself in a position to expand his playing field, and is buying television advertising and making appearances in several traditional Republican states.</p> <p>In the Nashville debate, McCain notably failed to mention the name of Bill Ayers, the co-founder of the Weather Underground, and aides to the senator were quoted yesterday saying he \"wouldn't focus\" on Obama's links to Ayers going forward, either. Sarah Palin, speaking in Florida, dropped all references to him. Then again, she mentioned him in a Fox interview last night, and the McCain campaign released a statement from a man named John Murtagh, descibing how the Weathermen had firebombed his house when he was nine. \"In other words,\" wrote Greg Sargent at Talking Points Memo, \"the McCain campaign wants Ayers to be discussed in the press, but doesn't want McCain - and now also Palin, perhaps - associated with such a slimy attack at a time when voters want solutions to the economic crisis.\" </p> <p>The Obama campaign sensed opportunity amid the negativity: it's to their advantage, of course, to point out where McCain seems to be trying to change the subject away from the economy. In an interview, the Democratic contender expressed surprise that McCain's campaign had been talking about Ayers, but that McCain hadn't been \"willing to say it to my face\".</p> <h2>What to watch for</h2> <p>Obama is in Ohio today, McCain and Palin are in Wisconsin. We also learned yesterday that Oprah Winfrey is back on the Obama circuit. She'll appear with the candidate, his wife and the Bidens at a Chicago fundraiser this weekend.</p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>Obama gained another two points in Gallup's daily tracking poll, putting him at 52% to McCain's 41% - his biggest lead of the election campaign so far. (The survey included almost no post-debate data.) Another interesting poll with relevance to the campaign, conducted by Public Religion Research, suggests that the \"culture wars\" may not have much purchase among young American Christians. It found that a majority of white evangelicals aged 18-34 favour either same-sex marriage or civil unions and that six in 10 young Catholics believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases. Obama has a clear lead among all US Catholics, at 51% to 40%. But white Catholics are evenly split, and they're a bellweather: they've voted with the winner of every presidential election since 1972, the Washington Post noted.</p> <h2>On theguardian.com now</h2> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/09/uselections2008.barackobama\">Timothy Garton Ash: The US needs to get over its cultural civil war - and fast</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/08/uselections2008.virginia\">Younge America: An evening with a swing state gun lover</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/oct/08/uselections2008.johnmccain\">Tomasky talk: Republicans 'gently tossing in the towel'</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/09/uselections2008.johnmccain2\">Ask the experts: is it really over for McCain</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/oct/09/uselections2008\">Roanoke voices: McCain campaign 'is desperate'</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/08/uselections2008.sarahpalin\">Tennessee politician's son indicted for hacking Palin's email</a></p> <h2>Best of the rest</h2> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://spectator.org/dsp_article.asp?art_id=14019\">American Spectator: It's the culture, stupid</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/09/opinion/09collins.html?hp\">New York Times: Clearing the Ayers</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/10/norm_coleman_gets_pressed_on_s_1.php\">Talking Points Memo: the worst press conference ever?</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/08/AR2008100800090.html?hpid=topnews\">Washington Post: New contagion, same old prescriptions</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/09/us/politics/09voting.html?hp\">New York Times: States' actions to block voters appear illegal</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/08/is-sarahs-new-hairstyle-p_n_133048.html\">Huffington Post: Palin's new hairstyle</a></p> <h2>Quote of the day</h2> <p>Sit down, take a few deep breaths, then try to digest Sarah Palin justifying her references to Bill Ayers: \"It is pertinent, it's important because when you consider Barack Obama's reaction to and explanation to his association there, and without him being clear at all on what he knew and when he knew it, that I think kinda peaks into his ability to tell us the truth on, not only on association but perhaps other things also ... so, it's relevant, I believe, and I brought it up in response to the New York Times article having been printed recently, and I think it just makes us ask the question that, if there's not forthrightness there, with that association and what was known and when it was known, does that lead us to ask, is there forthrightness with the plans Barack Obama has or say tax cuts, or spending increases, makes us question judgment.

  "<p>Making pronouncements about acting is a notoriously tricky pastime for its practitioners. It's obviously something that the actor feels passionate about. It's possible that they consider it intrinsic to their personalities and self esteem, so the potential for pomposity, especially in a quote taken out of context, is very great. The fact that, from the outside, the profession can seem a pit of superficiality, pretension and sycophancy means that \"talking about your art\" is deemed far less acceptable for actors than it is for writers or artists. </p> <p>But it's difficult not to roll your eyes when someone like Jeremy Irons comes along and reinforces the stereotype of actors as incoherent navel gazers.</p> <p>\"Acting is like the elastic band on a pair of knickers. When you see a nice bottom in a pair of denim jeans, you assume there's some sort of nice knicker that is holding it all in place, but you don't want to see the knicker line.\"</p> <p>Jeremy's certainly not the first to fall foul of a torturous (not to mention slightly seedy) simile. It's often when acting gets compared to something inappropriate that you wish the interviewee had stuck to a more prosaic profession. It's even worse when the comparison suggests that a film set is a life-or-death environment.</p> <p>\"Acting is like a high wire act. Your margin for error is very slim.\"<br>Christine Baranski</p> <p>Who knew that the set of Mamma Mia was such a dangerous place to practice your craft?</p> <p>Unfortunately there's a wealth of similar examples. Sean Penn, a fine actor who can be relied upon to take himself just that bit too seriously, was guilty of both the above offences when he decided the best way of describing his job was to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2006/jun/04/features.magazine1\">compare</a> it to skydiving.</p> <p>\"If you jump out of an aeroplane, you love the first 1,000ft. Now you're ready to land, but you're not gonna slow down just because you aren't interested any more. The craft is there to make sure that when you jump you're propelled properly to keep going full speed.\"</p> <p>There are many warning signs that indicate an actor is straying into wince-inducing territory, but none more certain than the pre-emptive recognition that a reader or listener might find what they have to say pretentious. If an actor's pseud alarm is ringing you can be pretty certain that everyone else heard it twenty minutes ago.</p> <p>\"We can talk about a cello having a soul, but when an actor talks about his soul people think, 'What a pretentious wanker'. A cello's soul is the resonance that makes it unique: how it was made, when it was made, who's played it. Mine may be who my parents were, what I know about life, who I love and have loved. All that makes my bones resonate. If a director is fortunate enough to tap into that, it's an endless well of information.\"<br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2001/jan/02/artsfeatures\">Ben Kingsley</a></p> <p>Russell Crowe's recent <a href=\"http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/crowe%20acting%20is%20a%20calling_1048330\">declaration</a> that he's not doing Hollywood films for the money featured a similar moment of self-awareness, as well as committing the cardinal sin of seeming to underplay the manifest economic rewards of a Hollywood career. Casey Affleck, too, managed to sound ungracious and humourless when <a href=\"http://latestnews.virginmedia.com/news/entertainment/2008/06/06/casey_i_never_have_fun\">comparing</a> many people's fantasy job to taking medicine. \"Some people have fun making movies, I don't understand that.\"</p> <p>But if we recognise the pitfalls of talking about acting, it's important to celebrate the moments when actors genuinely throw light on their peculiar profession. English actors have long practiced a neat line in self-deprecation, from Ralph Richardson's description of \"An art which consists of keeping the audience from coughing\" to Maggie Smith's skewering of one of the more <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meisner_technique\">humourless American acting methodologies</a>, as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2005/sep/12/awardsandprizes.oscars2006\">related</a> by Judi Dench.</p> <p>\"Acting is about the exploration of character rather than simply a projection of self. I was in New York with Maggie Smith recently, promoting a film, and we were asked about the Sanford Meisner Method school of acting which is based on ruthless self-exploration. Maggie, in her unique way, said, 'Oh, we have that in England, too. We call it wanking.'\"</p> <p>Two of my favourite comments on the craft come from rather more surprising sources. Rodney Dangerfield's career didn't hint at the possibility that he possessed a sensitive soul, so it's shocking to hear him say that \"Acting deals with very delicate emotions. It is not putting up a mask. Each time an actor acts he does not hide; he exposes himself.\" And somehow Darryl Hannah's description of the movie camera's gaze as \"like having someone you have a crush on watching you from afar - you pretend it's not there\" captures the delicate powerplay all the great screen actors inherently acknowledge and understand.</p> <p>One of the very best, perhaps unsurprisingly, comes from one of the best.</p> <p>\"Acting is the least mysterious of all crafts. Whenever we want something from somebody or when we want to hide something or pretend, we're acting. Most people do it all day long.\"<br>Marlon Brando</p> <p>Unlike a lot of his peers, Brando doesn't feel the need to emphasise how difficult it is to be a good actor. Instead he reminds us that its appeal lies in its universality.</p>",
  "<p>A degree of calm returned to the world's stockmarkets today following yesterday's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/creditcrunch.marketturmoil1\">coordinated global rate cut</a>.</p> <p>In London, the FTSE 100 jumped 3.2% at one stage this morning to a high of 4505, up 138 points, and was still up 61 points at midday. Banks continued to recover following <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/creditcrunch.marketturmoil1\">the UK goverment's \u00a3500bn rescue plan</a> announced yesterday, with shares in HBOS up 31%, Royal Bank of Scotland gaining 16% and Lloyds TSB 9% higher.</p> <p>\"There's a little bit of calm after what's been a very volatile week so far,\" said Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec. \"There's some realisation that world governments are serious about tackling the problems they find in front of them.\" But he added: \"We're unlikely to be entering a stable period; there's still a lot of nerves in markets.\"</p> <p>But the banks were still reluctant to lend to each other despite yesterday's half-point reduction in the Bank of England's base rate to 4.5%. Three-month sterling Libor - the rate which banks charge each other for short-term loans - rose to 6.28% this morning from 6.27% yesterday, with other indicators showing that financial firms are still hoarding cash.</p> <p>The financial crisis continued to ripple across Europe this morning. Share trading in Iceland was suspended. Iceland, which has been hit hard by the financial crisis, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/09/banking.iceland\">took control of the country's biggest bank Kaupthing</a>. Iceland has now brought most of its banking sector under state control. Kaupthing's board has resigned.</p> <p>European stocks recovered from heavy losses in recent days, with Germany's Dax rising 2.7% and France's CAC 40 up 2.8% in early trading. Troubled financial group Dexia jumped 25% after France, Belgium and Luxembourg announced they had agreed to provide state guarantees to help it borrow.</p> <p>Wall Street is expected to stage a rally and shrug off some of the 2% fall of the Dow Jones industrial average last night after the US treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, signalled that the government could invest in banks to help restore confidence in the sector.</p> <p>Speaking after the concerted interest rate cuts announced yesterday by the world's major central banks, Paulson appeared to suggest that the US treasury may follow the UK's lead by taking stakes in many US banks.</p> <p>\"We will use all of the tools we've been given to maximum effectiveness, including strengthening the capitalisation of financial institutions of every size,\" he told a news conference.</p> <p>Striking a cautious tone that sent shares sliding on Wall Street last night, Paulson cautioned the US rescue plan will not save all firms. \"One thing we must recognize - even with the new treasury authorities, some financial institutions will fail,\" he said, adding that regulators will take measures to limit the systemic risk from any single bank failure.</p> <p>Asian central banks have now joined in yesterday's unprecedented global rate cut. South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan all lowered their benchmark interest rates by a quarter point overnight. This followed half-point cuts from the Bank of England, the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and other European central banks. </p> <p>Asian stockmarkets were mixed, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng rising 3.3% and shares in Seoul up 0.6%, while Taiwan's index dropped 1.45%.</p> <p>The Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, said his government was prepared to buy stakes in failing banks while waiving voting rights. Italy has been largely shielded from the global financial turmoil because its banking sector is mostly retail, relying on savers' deposits rather than money markets. </p> <p>Germany may have to consider nationalising its banks if the crisis continues to worsen, finance minister Peer Steinbrueck told a newspaper. </p> <p>\"Just lowering interest rates would be far from sufficient in the current situation,\" said Amar Gill at CLSA in Singapore. \"The main problem now is that banks are not lending to weaker banks, and the overall banking system is not lending to corporates.\" </p> <p>The Bank of Japan did not take part in the coordinated rate cuts as its interest rates are already near zero, but the country's finance minister, Shoichi Nakagawa, welcomed the move. The Nikkei index closed down 0.5% at 9,157.<br></p>",
  "<p>The easier of Adair Turner's two main challenges is deciding how to save the entire UK banking system in his role as chairman of the Financial Services Authority. As head of the Climate Change Committee, the more difficult job is persuading the government that it needs to take substantial action over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbonemissions\">greenhouse gases</a>.</p> <p>Widespread relief greeted the publication of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/07/carbon.emissions.targets\">Committee's view that the UK should legislate to reduce emissions by 80% by 2050</a>. </p> <p>Less attention has been paid to some of the stranger assumptions in the committee's letter to Ed Miliband, the cabinet member now responsible for climate change. While climate scientists have generally been getting more and more pessimistic, Turner's figures convey a much more upbeat and cheerful tone.</p> <p>Turner argues that the world needs to stop greenhouse gas concentrations rising above about 460 parts per million. (They are about 430 today and rising at over 2 ppm a year.) </p> <p>Two years ago, Lord Stern suggested that global emissions would need to fall to about 13 billion tonnes a year by 2050 for the world to stabilise at the figure of 450 ppm. Turner is far more optimistic, saying that we can cope with 20 billion tonnes and still keep to about this level. In other words, Stern's maths was wrong by a large percentage \u2013 the world can emit about 50% more than his report indicated.</p> <p>This divergence is followed by a much more significant variation. One of the charts in Stern's first presentation indicates what would happen to temperature at various different levels of greenhouse gases. He says that a level of 450 ppm will produce an expected temperature rise of about 2.5 degrees Celsius. Once again, Turner is more buoyant than this, saying that his target for greenhouse gas concentrations will hold temperature rises to 2 degrees. He is also far more confident than Stern appeared to be about the risk of runaway global warming.</p> <p>These variations are highly significant but Turner gives us no explanation of why he is more upbeat than other analysts. By contrast, since the publication of his report, Stern seems to have become more and more worried by climate change. And many others, like Jim Hansen of NASA, have suggested aiming for far lower greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. Turner has gone in the other direction, making the problems of global warming seem much less onerous. On the basis of Stern's numbers, he should have asked for a 90% cut in emissions, not the relaxed 80% he proposes.</p> <p>He has also suggested that the costs of reducing our emissions are trivial. His committee indicates it will be 1-2% of GDP in 2050. This number is so small and so far away that nobody will take much notice. This is a trifle disingenuous. The real costs to cutting emissions are going to be incurred in the next fifteen years as we switch from convenient and inexpensive fossil fuels to more costly sources of power. Energy costs represent about 5% of the economy now, and this may rise sharply for a few years as we go through the early pain of what Turner calls 'decarbonisation'. Perhaps they will double for a few years. But by 2050, we can actually be reasonably confident that energy will actually cost less than it does now. Decades of going down the learning curve will give us the same sharp improvements in technology that we saw at the beginning of the coal and oil ages.</p> <p>Adair Turner may look and talk like a boffin, but not far below the surface is an acutely political animal. Has he deliberately made climate change a less threatening and cheaper problem to deal with than Stern did? The last few years have seen an unending succession of bad news stories on climate change. It all seems too awful to contemplate. Perhaps he feels that by giving us a radically more optimistic assessment he is increasing the chances of getting action from politicians. He may be right.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was shared by <a href=\"http://www.carboncommentary.com\">Carbon Commentary</a>, part of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/network\">Guardian Environmental Network</a></p>",
  "<p>The world's major central banks - and the Bank of England - got together yesterday and announced a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/09/business/09fed.html\">synchronised cut in their benchmark interest rates</a>. Even the People's Bank of China joined the party. And how did the financial markets respond? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/creditcrunch.marketturmoil1\">Sell, sell, sell</a>. The S&amp;P 500 share index <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/09/business/09markets.html\">slumped</a> for the sixth day in a row. Britain's FTSE ended the day's trading 5% down. So much for the rebound.</p> <p>That's what happens when there's a bear market in full swing. Events that in normal times would be good news become a reason to sell. And not only are the world's markets in a \"glass half empty\" mood right now, but what's in the glass is poisonous. When the market is in this mood, everything is a sell signal. In this case, the optimism over the monetary easing was cancelled out by pessimism over the extent of the global economic slide.</p> <p>That's exactly what happened on Tuesday as well. That morning the Federal Reserve had <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/08/business/08fed.html\">announced</a> it would begin buying <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-fi-bailout8-2008oct08,0,1413254.story\">commercial debt</a> - the unsecured, short-term loans that US businesses rely on to fund their daily operations but have recently had trouble obtaining because of the credit crunch. (This is a move that the Bank of England should follow - and probably will.) Then, the Fed chairman, Ben Bernanke, gave a speech hinting that <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/bernanke-hints-possible-interest-rate/story.aspx?guid=4DF367AA-C693-4260-9CD8-4DA0A475B281&amp;dist=SecMostRead\">US interest rates would soon be cut</a>. And what does he get in return? An across-the-board <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/investing/la-fi-markets8-2008oct08,0,642942.story\">fall in the stock markets</a> - the Dow Jones industrial average fell 150 points over the course of his speech, and slumped later in the day for a 5% fall overall. (\"He said all the right things but there wasn't any passion,\" whined one Wall Street suit on Bloomberg TV not long after Bernanke spoke.)</p> <p>Yet the truth is that interest rate cuts won't directly attack the <a href=\"http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/08/the-trouble-with-rate-cuts/?hp\">underlying problem</a> of this car crash: the seizing up of the credit markets caused by the weighing down of bank balance sheets with unstable and untradeable financial instruments. Far more important will be the bail-out packages now being implemented in Washington and London - and the differences between the two are an interesting study in the strengths and weaknesses of two political structures.</p> <p>Neither Britain nor the US have systems of governments that could be described as perfect. But looking at how respective policymakers have dealt with the financial crisis on both sides of the Atlantic, in this respect at least the cabinet government model of Westminster looks more effective than that of Pennsylvania Avenue.</p> <p>Consider the difficulties in getting the Paulson plan adopted. A week and a half of wrangling and arm-twisting in Congress was required - a symptom, to be fair, of a lame duck and wilting administration carrying no weight within its own party and an election looming. The Darling plan, in contrast, was spared a lengthy parliamentary battle - and as a result may have been better focused. The British government may have been slow in responding but when it did respond it did so more adroitly.</p> <p>Of the two plans there's little doubt that the Darling plan is more likely to be the more effective (assuming that one country can by itself solve problems that are rampant on international financial markets). By using \u00a350bn in government funds to directly recapitalise banks, it acts at the base of the problem, the insolvency risk of lending institutions. And it offers taxpayers a direct payback through swapping capital for equity. (\u00a350bn is unlikely to be enough, though.) Even better is the provision guaranteeing new borrowing by banks, even if the \u00a3250bn provided for the task may not be large enough. Even so, it helps British banks raise funds, and protects the government's exposure by restricting the guarantee to new borrowing.</p> <p>The Paulson plan, which is larded with provisions, hasn't yet been finalised - and is probably another four to six weeks away from taking concrete action. In the current climate that's dangerously slow.</p> <p>The Paulson plan also suffers from another problem: <a href=\"http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2008/10/06/16689/not-impressed-with-the-tarp-bnp-paribas-edition/\">it may not work</a>. The idea is that its vehicle will buy up at Goldilocks prices (not too hot, not too cold) the toxic mortgage-backed securities and derivatives from banks, and so relieve the banks' balance sheets. There are several problems with that approach, one being that $700bn will almost certainly not be enough, another being that no-one can reliably value what those credit default swaps and collateralised debt obligations and the rest of the alphabet soup are worth. The more the US Treasury pays, the fewer it can buy. The less it pays, the bigger the write-down on bank balance sheets. Further, this approach actually rewards the worst offenders - those banks with the worst balance sheets will presumably do the most business with the government vehicle. (And of course those worst offenders may still end up going bust anyway - making the exercise a futile one.)</p> <p>But again, to be fair, the size and complexity of the US financial market is mind-boggling, and it far dwarfs that of any other economy. And we wait to see what mechanism the US Treasury will use to spend its $700bn. One advantage of the Darling plan's approach is that the mechanism involved is relatively straightforward.</p> <p>What I suspect will happen is that over time the Darling and Paulson plans will look more and more like each other. HM Treasury may authorise the purchase of commercial debt, and even set up a special vehicle to quarantine toxic mortgage assets. The US Treasury is <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/09/business/economy/09econ.html\">already considering</a> using the British approach to inject capital into banks.</p> <p>And if that's the road we go down, here's another ideas: the UK (and US, if they follow suit) government should have a seat on the boards of the banks it is recapitalising - and ensure that those banks do not give out dividends to their shareholders until taxpayers have been paid back, a measure that the Swedish government adopted during its successful bank bail-out in the early 1990s.</p>",
  "<p><strong>By Staci D. Kramer</strong></p> <p><strong>EMI</strong> is planning a pre-holiday launch of a new music portal that will include the ability to buy downloads, <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b76fa624-94d1-11dd-953e-000077b07658.html\">according to the <strong>FT</strong></a>. We've confirmed that but a source familiar with the project says it is not an attempt to displace digital retailers like <strong>iTunes</strong> or <strong>Amazon</strong> or as some EMI version of <strong>Sony Connect</strong>. It's meant more as a consumer testbed, a way for EMI to see what interests users most and how they respond to various things. It will include artist and catalog information; audio and video downloads will be both free and paid. EMI is declining comment although this seems like the sort of thing they should be talking about.</p> <p>It's another example of content ubiquity in an online universe that seems to veer between exclusivity and total availability. <strong>Universal</strong> is looking a video portal. (If they could clone the <strong>International Music Feed</strong> that was killed when sold to <strong>Ovation</strong>, it would make a lot of people happy.)

  "<p>Kelly Slater, who last week won his ninth world surfing championship, is one of surfing's more articulate sons. Interviewed by Drew Kampion, himself an <em>eminence grise</em> of surf journalism, Slater once said: \"My belief is that heaven and hell are metaphorical terms for what you make of your life. In any instant, you have the ability to make your life total pleasure or total hell.\"</p> <p>The Floridian surfer's latest triumph consolidates an already unparalleled career in professional surfing, one which demonstrates both preternatural athleticism and an extraordinary ability, over countless instants, to make the right decision, in the right place, at the right time. </p> <p>Slater is, quite simply, the greatest surfer ever. He is but one of a handful of surfers to transcend the sport and, in his overwhelming domination of competitive surfing in the modern era, merits comparison with legends from the mainstream of sporting endeavour \u2013 the likes of Michael Schumacher, Lance Armstrong and Tiger Woods. Some would argue that he eclipses them all, for Slater's reign not only spans a remarkable 16 years, but also includes a three-year hiatus during which he didn't compete at all. </p> <p>Slater sealed his ninth Association of Surfing Professionals (ASP) world title at the Billabong Pro Mundaka, in northern Spain, last Friday. He didn't win the event, because he didn't have to: a third-round heat victory in four-foot surf against local charger Eneko Acero was enough to put him out of sight from his nearest rivals, the Australian trio of Taj Burrow, Joel Parkinson and Bede Durbidge. Emotionally drained, Slater exited the contest in the next round, but with five first-place finishes on the 11-event World Championship Tour (WCT) for 2008 under his belt, Slater could justifiably claim to be surfing better than ever. What makes this all the more astonishing is that in a sport whose practitioners usually peak in their mid-to-late 20s, Slater is 36.</p> <p>Born in Cocoa Beach, Florida, Slater is both the youngest surfer ever to win the ASP world title, and the oldest. He was first crowned champion in 1992, aged 20, and became the oldest winner at 34 when he won his eighth title. And if he's just set the bar yet higher by vanquishing all-comers at the age of 36, the records don't stop there.</p> <p>In each heat, the ASP operates a two-wave scoring system in which a surfer's best two waves are aggregated, with a maximum possible score of 20; needless to say, Slater is the only surfer ever to score a perfect 20. He easily outpaces Australian surfer Mark Richards' four ASP titles (the previous record until Slater came along), and has the highest number of contest wins in surfing history (39). For the surfing cognoscenti, Hawaii remains the proving ground, but here, too, Slater has excelled, winning the most prestigious individual event on the WCT, the Pipeline Masters, a record five times. </p> <p>Mobbed by reporters at the water's edge in Spain, Slater was all but lost for words. \"It's going to take a little while to sink in,\" he said. \"I'm probably going to have to call home and talk to family for it to really hit me.\" But if the man himself needed time to reflect, the surfing world didn't. The eulogies were immediate, and with them, another wave of expectation: will Slater compete again next year, and try to win his 10th title? Slater says he will, but that if he has to end his career with nine titles, he \"won't feel frustrated\".</p> <p>Slater's celebrity status has been enhanced by high-profile romances with Cameron Diaz (herself a surfer), Pamela Anderson and Brazilian supermodel Gisele Bundchen. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcWZO9zhIyk\">He appeared in several episodes of Baywatch</a> in the early 1990s and, a talented guitarist, <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=80c0gigjx0E\">he has also performed with Ben Harper and Pearl Jam</a>. Inevitably, there is a hugely successful video game, too \u2013 the aptly named Kelly Slater's Pro Surfer \u2013 not to mention endless starring roles in surf movies, perhaps the most famous of which is the Jack Johnson showcase, <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=vQCFt3mkrZ0\">Thicker Than Water</a>.</p> <p>It's all a far cry from his early years at Cocoa Beach, where Slater's parents, Steve and Judy, experienced debilitating financial problems. The couple divorced when their middle son (Slater's brothers, Sean and Steven, are also excellent surfers) was 11. The boys witnessed their father's uneasy relationship with alcohol, and perhaps, as with so many high achievers, a degree of parental dysfunction contributed to Slater's immense drive. That drive, in turn, has taken him to a wealthy lifestyle which he could never have imagined as a young boy, but his success is fundamentally down to a freakish natural talent in the sea. To watch Slater surf is to be mesmerized by a blend of suppleness, power and elegance allied with an uncanny wave-reading skill. His surfing is so fluid and gymnastic that it's as if he inhabits the ocean, rather merely visits it.</p> <p>Like his childhood hero and three-time world champion Tom Curren, Slater on land is no less notable. Both walk with a feline grace - a nuanced, barely discernible but subtle awareness of everything in their environment. It's a rare thing, and what's more, Slater knows it. As he says: \"Most anything I've ever set my mind to, I could accomplish. I felt like I was always in the right place at the right time.\" The worry for his rivals is that this time next year, the likelihood is that Kelly Slater will once again find himself in just the right place, at just the right time.</p> <p><em>Alex Wade is the author of Surf Nation: In Search of the Fast Lefts and Hollow Rights of Britain and Ireland(Simon &amp; Schuster), \u00a37.99.

  "<p>Britain's largest staffing firm warned today that the UK labour market is set to suffer a sharp slowdown, with hefty job cuts throughout the City, and in property and construction.</p> <p>Hays's forecast echoed that of Bank of England monetary policy committee member, David Blanchflower, who last month said there would be a grim run up to Christmas this year with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/11/recession.unemploymentdata\">tens of thousands of people facing unemployment</a> as the UK economy slides into <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/recession\">recession</a>.</p> <p>The company said that fees in the UK and Ireland, where it generates around half of its income, fell 8% in the last three months due to sluggish hiring in the City - reflecting the impact of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">credit crunch</a> and collapsing financial sector.</p> <p>Permanent job placements are also being squeezed, with fees earned from these rising by just 1%. Instead the group said more temporary work is being generated, with like-for-like net fees in this area up 8%.</p> <p>\"The UK is being impacted by wider economic issues affecting corporate and candidate confidence. The most affected areas are City related activities and the construction and property sectors where we've seen a significant reduction in demand,\" chief executive, Alistair Cox said in a conference call today, adding there \"no doubt that markets are getting tougher\".</p> <p>Like-for-like net fees grew at 4% in the three months to the end of September, the group said.</p> <p>Hays, which employs about 9,000 staff worldwide, said it had trimmed its workforce by 5% over the quarter to cut costs, following a 7% reduction earlier in the year.</p> <p>Earlier this week, rival recruiter Michael Page announced a leap in third quarter profit of 14.6%, while UK staffing firm Robert Walters today said third quarter net fees had grown by 6%.

Continental Europe also held up well.</p> <p>FinnCap analyst Duncan Hall said despite Hays global reach, domestic sentiment would have a \"significant bearing on prospects\".</p> <p>\"There are good opportunities in places such as Germany and the United Arab Emirates and where we see good trends we'll continue to invest with caution,\" said Cox. He said he would continue to focus on keeping costs low and reacting to the economic conditions too keep business afloat.</p> <p>Shares in Hays, which have shed 30% since the turn of the year, were nearly 6% higher at 78.25 pence by mid-morning.</p>",

The 100 patient beds are arranged in single, two-bedded and four-bedded units, each with a sea view. </p> <p>Furniture has been specially designed for children and every in-patient bed has its own pull-out bed for a parent. Family accommodation on the top level includes en-suite bedrooms, kitchens, living rooms and terraces. </p> <p>The prime minister, Gordon Brown, said: \"This award showcases what can be achieved when high-quality design is coupled with highly effective delivery. I hope that the Alex will prove to be an inspiration to other planners, developers and architects.\" </p> <p>The hospital was opened in 1881 but in June 2007 it reopened at a new site, at the city's Royal Sussex county hospital, with three times the floor space of the old hospital and double the number of beds. </p> <p>The new hospital was commissioned by the Brighton and Sussex University hospitals NHS trust, funded by the private finance initiative, and delivered by Kajima Partnerships with designers BDP. </p> <p>John Sorrell, chairman of architecture watchdog the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment, said: \"The new Alex is a people's palace and a sign of how far we have come. </p> <p>\"The quality of public buildings commissioned in Britain is now in a different league from the place we were 10 years ago.\" </p> <p>Duncan Selbie, chief executive of Brighton and Sussex University hospitals NHS trust, said: \"The teams who work at the Alex have always been committed to providing the highest quality medical and nursing care. </p> <p>\"Now they have the space, facilities and equipment to provide a vast range of clinical and therapeutic services in an environment skillfully designed to accommodate 21st-century healthcare.\" </p> <h2>This year's shortlist</h2> <p>Barking Learning Centre, London<br>Castleford Bridge, West Yorkshire<br>Castleford Weir Fish Pass, West Yorkshire<br>Cleveleys coast protection, Lancashire<br>Cremorne Riverside Centre, London<br>Dartford Creek Frontages Project, Erith, Kent<br>DLR Langdon Park station, London<br>Hexham flood alleviation scheme, Northumberland<br>Lymington New Forest hospital, Hampshire<br>Manchester Civil Justice Centre<br>National Theatre Studio, London<br>Newbiggin Bay coast protection scheme, Northumberland<br>Newlyn Art Gallery, Cornwall<br>Riverside Bridge, Cambridge<br>Royal Alexandra children's hospital, Brighton, East Sussex<br>Royal Festival Hall, London<br>Royal Hall, Harrogate, North Yorkshire<br>St Marylebone CE School Performing Arts Centre, London<br>Sheffield inner relief road, South Yorkshire<br>Shetland Museum and Archives, Lerwick, Shetland<br>Young Vic, London</p>",
  "<p>Apparently, it takes more than the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/oct/09/useconomy.creditcrunch1\">imminent meltdown of global capitalism</a> to shake Simon Heffer out of his trenchant free market views. Like a magnificent, iron-clad dreadnought ploughing ahead at full steam through choppy waters, the Telegraph's star columnist is not about to be turned.</p> <p>Today's paper grants him <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2008/10/09/do0901.xml&amp;page=1\">an entire page</a> to pen 1,500-words of invective which unhesitatingly condemns Gordon Brown's <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7658277.stm\">recapitalisation of the banks</a> as an Old Labour Trojan horse which will take us meekly back to the statist days of the 1970s.</p> <p>\"We're all socialists now,\" he booms ironically below a mocked up picture of the prime minister in full Soviet military dress:</p> <blockquote> <p>The intervention, or rather interference, of the state in financial and economic matters can only lead to sclerosis, the suppression of enterprise, the raising of taxes, starvation of investment, lack of innovation, technological retardation and the rise of the power of organised labour.</p> </blockquote> <p>Heffer is now in full flow, speculating about a possible \"new socialist policy on lending\":</p> <blockquote> <p>Will it be easier for Labour's client groups to get loans to buy housing, or even to buy a car, than those deemed to be more affluent?</p> </blockquote> <p>Moreover, he predicts, this \"neo-sovietisation\" will prove so alluring to the government that even if the banks are turned around there is a risk they will remain under permanent state control.</p> <p>It's strong stuff, but Heffer isn't finished yet.</p> <p>Not content with implicitly dismissing the <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122350283630616859.html\">Wall Street Journal</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d4d9a8de-959b-11dd-aedd-000077b07658.html\">FT</a> as lily-livered leftists, he approvingly quotes the uber-individualist author and philosopher, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Atlas-Shrugged-Ayn-Rand/dp/0451191145\">Ayn Rand</a>, to surmise that \"the difference between a welfare state and a totalitarian state is a matter of time\".</p> <p>Blimey. Even some of Heffer's loyal readership, used to his regular pot shots at David Cameron for being insufficiently keen on tax cuts, are taken aback. One, John Mack, writes on the paper's website:</p> <blockquote> <p>Simon, I missed the part where you pointed out what should have been done, and how a true capitalist approach would have ensured we never got into this mess in the first place.</p> </blockquote> <p>By way of a quick contrast, if Heffer is a man who has woken up in a nightmare where James Callaghan never lost power, then the Guardian's very own <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/seumasmilne\">Seumas Milne</a> must think all his Christmases have come at once.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/oct/09/banking.banks\">a column</a> almost as full of fruity invective as Heffer's (Brown's plan \"delivered the funeral rites on the corpse of high Thatcherism\") Milne calls for considerably greater state control of banking.</p> <p>Failed banks, he argues, should be fully nationalised as \"the core of a newly accountable and publicly controlled banking sector able to channel investment where it's needed, rather than into reckless speculation in debt and housing bubbles\".</p> <p>It's like the 1970s all over again.

  "<p>Ten million more passengers a year will go through Stansted airport and 23,000 more flights after the government today approved its expansion, angering environmental critics.</p> <p>The transport secretary, Geoff Hoon, granted permission for the airport to increase flights from 241,000 to 264,000 and raise the number of passengers from 25 million to 35 million.</p> <p>He announced the changes to Stansted's planning conditions in a written statement to parliament.</p> <p>Permission was originally refused by Uttlesford district council in November 2006 on grounds of noise and environmental concerns.</p> <p>The government overruled the council, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/09/theairlineindustry.transport\">as forecast in today's Guardian</a>, after an appeal by the airports operator <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/baa\">BAA</a> and a lengthy public inquiry.</p> <p>Stansted's managing director, Stewart Wingate, said the decision, taken by Hoon and the communities and local government secretary, Hazel Blears, was \"great news\" for passengers, and for businesses in the region.</p> <p>Green groups reacted angrily, accusing the government of approving the expansion in defiance of its own commitment to reduce CO2 emissions and tackle climate change.</p> <p>This week, the UK government's official climate change advisers said a cut in greenhouse gas emissions of at least 80% by 2050 should include international aviation \u2013 as raised by Gordon Brown at last month's party conference.</p> <p>Friends of the Earth said the Stansted decision showed the government's climate change strategy was \"a complete shambles\". The senior Greenpeace transport campaigner, Anita Goldsmith, said: \"Labour has promoted a binge-flying culture in Britain for too long, and unfortunately it looks like it will be business as usual from the new transport secretary.\"</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/aviation/airports/decisionletters/stansted/\">letter to BAA's lawyers</a> from the departments of transport and local government says the proposal will bring \"large economic benefits\" and provides \"adequate\" road, rail and coach access. It complies with local and national polices, including the air transport white paper, on issues such as nitrogen deposits on vegetation and the provision of water, sewerage and drainage, the letter says.</p> <p>The departments acknowledge there may be \"some negative health effects due to changes in levels of air pollution\" but say these would be small. Other possible negative effects include \"further erosion of traditional social linkages in smaller settlements and increased unauthorised activity and some adverse effects with regard to impact on residential areas\".</p> <p>The letter acknowledges that nitrogen levels are \"a cause for concern\" in terms of their impact on Hatfield forest and nearby protected woodland.</p> <p>But the secretaries of state conclude there are not \"any material considerations of sufficient weight which would justify refusing planning permission\".</p> <p>The letter says the decision should not be taken as supporting a second runway at Stansted - which is part of BAA's long-term plan.</p> <p>Green groups had described the Stansted inquiry as the sternest test of government aviation policy since climate change became a major political issue.</p> <p>Graham Thompson, an activist with the campaign group Plane Stupid and one of those who occupied the roof of parliament to protest against airport expansion, said: \"Whether it's Ruth Kelly or Geoff Hoon, it's quite clear that the minister for BAA is not working in the interests of Britain. Our democratic checks and balances are failing and escalating direct action is now inevitable.\"</p> <p>The Liberal Democrats transport spokesman, Norman Baker, said: \"This is further evidence that the government is in the pocket of the aviation industry. It shows the gaping void between its environmental rhetoric and reality. Ministers like to talk green, but their actions show they are only too willing to increase carbon emissions.\"</p> <p>Uttlesford district council, which is based in Saffron Walden, Essex, has six weeks to appeal against the government's decision. A council spokesman said no decision had yet been taken about such action.</p> <p>The council leader, Jim Ketteridge, said the decision was a blow to the community. \"Residents already find the level of aircraft noise extremely disturbing and allowing BAA to increase the amount of air traffic marks a further erosion of our quality of life, particularly for all those living near Stansted airport.</p> <p>\"We are very disappointed that the appeal has been allowed but are redoubling our efforts to fight the second runway proposals.\"</p> <p>Michelle Di Leo, the director of the pro-flying lobby FlyingMatters, said the announcement was \"very good news\" for millions of people who relied on air transport to visit friends and family and do business abroad, as well as leisure travellers.</p> <p>\"The government's decision demonstrates real confidence in the ability of the aviation industry to meet the twin challenges of increased demand and the environment,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>Do people <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/oct/05/police\">really want to join</a> an organisation that has racist tendencies and policies and repressive practices limiting progress and ambition? The London-based Black Police Association (BPA) clearly thinks not.</p> <p>Nine years on from the pivotal <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/Lawrence\">Lawrence inquiry</a> and its assertion that <a href=\"http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm42/4262/4262.htm\">\"institutional racism\" was endemic</a> in the British police, the professional Metropolitan Black Police Association began a boycott on Monday of recruitment to the Met. Its chairman, Alfred John, stated that it is boycotting all drives to attract black and minority ethnic recruits and staff to Britain's largest police service, claiming it would be wrong to encourage people to join a \"hostile and racist environment\".</p> <p>If black employees of the police service do not have any confidence in their own organisation to treat them with dignity and respect, it is almost impossible too for black communities themselves to have any trust or confidence. The paradox is that it had been historically argued and widely felt that black people joining the police were signing up to a profession that was racist to its core and symbolic of the regulation and control of black communities.</p> <p>Nothing seems to have changed from the Home Office research in 1999 entitled <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/prgpdfs/fprs107.pdf\">Career Progression of Ethnic Minority Police Officers</a>, which concluded that, in almost every aspect of career progression, black and minority ethnic officers had been discriminated against, retention of black officers had deteriorated, resignation was twice as likely among black officers compared with white officers and rates of dismissal were three times higher than for white officers. Only 3% of black officers and 1.9% of Asian officers had some experience of working in a specialist department compared with 9.1% of white officers.</p> <p>In 2003, Dr Nirmal Puwar produced a valuable piece of research into the experiences of black and minority ethnic women within the police service, highlighting how they suffered some overt but mainly subtle or latent forms of racism.</p> <p>She concluded that black and minority ethnic women, while located on the inside of the police, were at the same time outsiders occupying a tenuous position and facing issues of invisibility and visibility. Black and minority ethnic women were confined to core, front-desk or back-office policing roles, not specialist posts, and on average their pay was within the lower salary bands.</p> <p>In October 2003, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/oct/21/bbc.raceintheuk\">the BBC Panorama programme The Secret Policeman</a> demonstrated how individuals with overt racist views had managed to pass through both the recruitment and training process to join the police service in Manchester, allowing them to pursue their personal pernicious agenda.</p> <p>After the screening of The Secret Policeman, presented by the journalist Mark Daly, the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) announced that it would be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/oct/31/race.ukcrime\">formally investigating the police service</a> regarding its recruitment and training practices.</p> <p>By 2007, the CRE disappeared into the new Equalities and Human Rights Commission and its powerful formal investigation arm was lost forever.</p> <p>The post-Lawrence anti-racism training offered an ideal opportunity to root out a minority of police staff whose personal racism, in my opinion, was so dangerously high that they simply were not fit for operational policing duties.</p> <p>It was a missed opportunity because while the training was compulsory, it was not, as it should have been, a \"pass\" or \"fail\" course. Police trainers were powerless to address the explicit racism that they encountered and witnessed.</p> <p>In January 2004, the Metropolitan Police Authority announced its intention to hold an independent inquiry into professional standards and employment matters at the Met. The <a href=\"http://www.mpa.gov.uk/morrisinquiry/report/default.htm\">Morris inquiry</a> was meant to be a root and branch examination of the allegations of racism, victimisation and discrimination plaguing the Met and involving the treatment of black and minority ethnic officers. To most, it appears that the inquiry's outcomes and recommendations have simply been left to gather dust.</p> <p>In 2008, the range of abuse that black employees of the police service face include \"being sidelined\", \"left out of decision-making\", \"given tedious work rather than more challenging work\", \"not being selected for high-profile portfolios\", \"being made to feel useless, not valued, not appreciated and not utilised\", \"being pigeon-holed and straitjacketed into predetermined positions as a token gesture\", \"training opportunities, secondment and other career-enhancing opportunities being curtailed and limited\" \u2013 the list is endless.</p> <p>Black police staff, both officers and personnel, describe to me a police service that is designed to break you physically, mentally and spiritually.</p> <p>The latest BBC Panorama programme, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00f3ty2\">The Secret Policeman Returns</a>, has revealed widespread dissatisfaction among black and minority ethnic staff. In surveying BPA members, it found that 72% had experienced racism at work, 60% felt their career had been hindered by their ethnicity and 61% said things had stayed the same or got worse.</p> <p>The chief constable of Kent, Mike Fuller, Britain's first and only black chief constable, spoke for many when he stated that \"you have to work twice as hard (as your white counterpart) to compete.\"</p> <p>The public outcry over racism from senior Officers like the extremely talented, sharp and intelligent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/20/tarique.ghaffur.profile\">Assistant Commissioner Tarique Ghaffur</a> is just the tip of the iceberg. Consequently, it is not surprising that the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, in his flawed kneejerk response called for a not so \"independent inquiry\", albeit as an attempt to head off the BPA's formal boycott.</p> <p>The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, also understands the seriousness of the situation, hence her request for an immediate nationwide assessment of how black and minority ethnic employees are treated by the police.</p> <p>As a responsive service, it would be unfair and wrong to claim that there has been no progress within the Met since the Lawrence inquiry. Clearly there has been some, but I would argue this progress has always been a rearguard action.</p> <p>The police service has never really been able to lead from the front and inspire real change, new ways of thinking and operating, and despite having had one of the most liberal police commissioners to date, Sir Ian Blair, its organisational culture has fundamentally not changed.</p> <p>Challenging the terrorist agenda and the rise in violent crime involving children and young people allowed the police service to unite and park for a while the vexed issue of institutional racism. It returned to business as usual in the name of challenging terrorism and tackling \"youth murders\" \u2013 young black and Asian people were feeling the heat on the streets in more ways than one.</p> <p>However, the National Black Police Association, which had its roots in London, could not divert from its fundamental aim \"to seek to improve the working environment of black staff members with a view to enhancing the quality of service to black and minority ethnic communities in the UK\".</p> <p>It is this cause that would inevitably bring them into direct conflict with what is still widely regarded within the black community as \"the boot of the state\".</p> <p>In spite of the National BPA's motto, \"One voice, strength in unity\", the continued mistreatment by the police of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/19/1\">its president, Ali Dizaei</a>, is symbolic of the stranglehold that the state has on black communities and ultimately undermines the very existence of the NBPA.</p> <p>It is absolutely clear that those who experience racism first hand and have the courage to speak up and speak out are systematically vilified. Too little is being done to address the racism of those that operate at the frontline of policing and there is still much more work to be done to protect those vulnerable to discrimination and racism within the service and to stem the continued rise of those leaving in the face of discrimination.</p> <p>The police still have a long way to go in the whole area of recruitment, retention and progression and public confidence within the black community towards the police is still at an all-time low.</p> <p>Of course, the police service is not alone. Even the most progressive of organisations cannot tolerate being criticised for acts of institutional racism and discrimination and those that complain about such organisations are quickly silenced and shifted aside.</p> <p>Individuals are victimised and hounded out of their jobs. Senior managers and those in positions of power from across a wide range of organisations become indignant at the thought that they or their organisation could be accused of institutional racism. They cite such claims by their employees as an act of disloyalty which should only be rewarded by a swift boot up the arse, thus creating a climate of fear for those who dare to exercise their right to complain. </p> <p>The current racism row within the police service holds a mirror up to us all.<br>Radical action is needed in order for change to occur, so that those that have the courage to complain are adequately protected and those who suffer discrimination have proper opportunities for justice.</p>",
  "<p>Given the negative reaction to the unprecedented combination of the UK government's \u00a3500bn bank bail-out plan and the coordinated global interest rate cut, a bounce in the stockmarket was almost inevitable. So far it is happening, with the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> up 102.1 points at 4468.8.</p> <p>Banks are main beneficiaries, which is as it should be given the size and scope of the government bail out. <strong>HBOS </strong>is up 25% to 145.9p, <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> has risen a similar amount to 112.7p and <strong>Lloyds TSB</strong> is up 10% to 231p. But <strong>Barclays</strong> is down 8.5 p at 269.5p, on suggestions it might offer existing shareholders \u00a33bn of preference shares before calling on the government's coffers</p> <p>Goldman has cut its price target for HBOS from 220p to 140p but put a buy rating on the bank. But it recommends selling Barclays and Lloyds, and is neutral on Royal Bank of Scotland.</p> <p>It's clear we are not out of the woods yet, however. The morning's fix on libor - the rate at which banks lend to each other - should give an indication whether the government's injection of liquidity into the system is enough. Are banks confident enough yet to get things back to something approaching normal? At the moment the indications are mixed, with talk that libor will still be substantially above the new base rate.</p> <p>Meanwhile - as if a 50 basis point reduction was not enough - there is talk about whether the Bank of England should cut again before its next meeting in early November. It would seem likely, however, that the Bank would wait and see what happens in the next few days before making any imminent decision. But in these turbulent times, not much can be ruled out.</p> <p>On top of that, the US market will be keenly watched as the short-selling ban is lifted. </p> <p>Andrew Turnbull of spread betters ODL Securities said: \"The reaction today really will raise the issue of whether short-selling was truly to blame for the large falls in financial stocks.\"</p> <p>After yesteday's falls in the wake of the disposal of entrepreneur Robert Tchenguiz's 10% stake at 250p a share, supermarket group<strong> J Sainsbury </strong>has recovered 4% to 278.5p.</p> <p>But <strong>SCi Entertainment</strong> has slipped another 1% to 22.75p on uncertainty surrounding the Tchenguiz stake in the computer games company.</p> <p>On the results front, <strong>WH Smith</strong> is up 8.5% to 347.5p after it unveiled a forecast beating 15% increase in full year profits. </p> <p>Oriel Securities analyst Jonathan Pritchard said: \"WH Smith has delivered excellent top of the range figures. The shares have fallen way too far and are a stonking buy. The dividend is up by 20%: how many retailers can you name who have shown this much confidence? Finance director Alan Stewart's departure is the only fly in the ointment, but shouldn't harm sentiment.\"</p> <p>But bakery chain <strong>Greggs</strong> lost after it cut its expectations for full year operating profits by \u00a33m.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/houseprices\">House prices</a> fell at a record rate during the year to the end of September, losing 13.3% of their value, Halifax said today.</p> <p>Figures from the UK's largest <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/mortgages\">mortgage</a> lender show the average price of a home has fallen further in the past 12 months than it did in the property crash of the early 1990s.</p> <p>Between May 1989 and August 1995, the Halifax index shows the average price dropped by 13.2% from \u00a370,247 to \u00a360,965.</p> <p>The recent price falls have reduced the average price of a home to \u00a3172,108, almost back to the level it was at in January 2006 and more than \u00a326,000 less than in September last year.</p> <p>The annual price fall quoted by Halifax, which is calculated on the basis of three months' figures, also reached a record high at 12.4%. </p> <p>Prices dropped by 1.3% over the month, suggesting the government's decision to increase the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/stampduty\">stamp duty</a> threshold to \u00a3175,000, announced in early September, did little to reinvigorate the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/property\">property</a> market.</p> <p>The figures were in line with analysts' expectations and were broadly similar <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/oct/03/houseprices.housingmarket\">to those reported by Nationwide last week</a>, which showed that house prices fell by 1.7% in September and 12.4% during the past year.</p> <p>Like Nationwide, Halifax said it had seen quarterly prices level off, with the 5.2% fall over the summer broadly in line with the fall recorded between April and June.</p> <p>This, it said, was a sign that the rate of decline could be beginning to stabilise. </p> <h2>Bank bail out</h2> <p>The figures come a day after the government committed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/creditcrunch.marketturmoil1\">\u00a3500bn of public money to bail out the UK's banking system</a> and announced a shock cut in interest rates.</p> <p>Halifax has already announced it will be passing the 0.5% cut on to borrowers, and today its chief economist, Martin Ellis, said lower rates would \"provide a valuable support to the housing market\".</p> <p>But despite the package, which was designed to bolster UK banks and free up inter-bank lending, Ellis said conditions were set to remain \"challenging\".</p> <p>\"The ongoing pressures on householders' income, combined with the reduction in the availability of mortgage finance, mean that market conditions will remain challenging,\" he said.</p> <p>Ellis said average incomes had not kept pace with rising prices over the past year - increasing by 3.5% compared with a 5% increase in the retail price index - and big hikes in energy and fuel prices.</p> <p>At the same time, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/mortgages\">mortgage</a> costs have increased as a result of the credit squeeze on lenders.</p> <p>Halifax said the average mortgage rate paid by new borrowers has risen by 0.22% over the past year from 5.88% in August 2007 to 6.10% in August 2008, despite a 0.75% reduction in the base rate over the period.</p> <p>Howard Archer, chief UK economist at Global Insight, said he believed prices would fall \"substantially further\" despite yesterday's interest rate cut. </p> <p>\"Credit conditions remain extremely tight and this continues to exert upward pressure on many mortgage rates and limit the amount of mortgages available,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Affordability ratios are still very stretched despite the double-digit fall in house prices seen so far. </p> <p>\"On top of this, faster rising unemployment, heightened concerns over the economic outlook, and widespread expectations that house prices will continue to fall markedly seem set to depress housing market activity and prices for some considerable time to come.\"</p> <p>The UK government's rescue package and the co-ordinated interest rate cuts around the world seem to have restored a certain confidence in banks, with shares in HBOS and RBS all up this morning.</p> <p>However, news from the US suggests the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/09/useconomy.creditcrunch1\">credit crunch is far from over</a> and even if the UK package does work it could be some time before borrowers see any benefit.</p> <p>In the meantime, banks are expected to focus new lending on the least risky customers, which means <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/firsttimebuyers\">first-time buyers</a> will continue to struggle to get mortgages.</p>",
  "<p>The US treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, has signalled that the government could invest in banks as it tries to contain the deepening <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">global crisis</a>, as Asian central banks joined in the unprecedented <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/creditcrunch.marketturmoil1\">coordinated global rate cut</a>.</p> <p>Following the concerted interest rate cuts announced yesterday by several central banks, it appears that the US treasury is now considering taking stakes in many US banks. The news comes after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/creditcrunch.marketturmoil1\">Britain announced a \u00a3500bn bank rescue package</a>, including \u00a350bn to buy stakes in its major banks. </p> <p>At a news conference in Washington, Paulson said that the federal government would use \"all resources at its disposal to make our financial system stronger\". </p> <p>\"We will use all of the tools we've been given to maximum effectiveness, including strengthening the capitalisation of financial institutions of every size.\"</p> <p>Striking a cautious tone that sent shares sliding on Wall Street, Paulson cautioned the US rescue plan will not save all firms. \"One thing we must recognize - even with the new treasury authorities, some financial institutions will fail,\" he said, adding that regulators will take measures to limit the systemic risk from any single bank failure.</p> <p>A degree of calm returned to the world's stockmarkets today. In London the FTSE 100 rose 93 points in early trading to 4459 points, a gain of 2.1%. Markets in Germany and France were also up, after Wall Street closed down 2% yesterday in another jittery session.</p> <p>UK banking shares led the risers in London, with HBOS up 27%, Royal Bank of Scotland gaining 20% and Lloyds TSB 10% higher.</p> <p>South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan all cut their domestic interest rates by a quarter point overnight. This followed yesterday's half-point cuts by the Bank of England, the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, with the UK base rate being lowered to 4.5% from 5% at midday yesterday.</p> <p>The financial crisis continued to ripple across Europe this morning. Iceland, which has been hit hard by the financial crisis, this morning <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/09/banking.iceland\">took control of the country's biggest bank Kaupthing</a>. Iceland has now brought most of its banking sector under state control. Kaupthing's board resigned.</p> <p>The Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, said his government was prepared to buy stakes in failing banks while waiving voting rights. Italy has been largely shielded from the global financial turmoil because its banking sector is mostly retail, relying on savers' deposits rather than money markets. </p> <p>Germany may have to consider nationalising its banks if the crisis continues to worsen, finance minister Peer Steinbrueck told a newspaper. </p> <p>And in Asia, stockmarkets were mixed after quarter-point rate cuts in Seoul, Hong Kong and Taipei. Hong Kong's Hang Seng was up 2.1% at 15762 and shares in Seoul edged up 0.6%, while Taiwan's index dropped 1.45% to 5130.</p> <p>\"Just lowering interest rates would be far from sufficient in the current situation,\" said Amar Gill at CLSA in Singapore. \"The main problem now is that banks are not lending to weaker banks, and the overall banking system is not lending to corporates.\" </p> <p>The Bank of Japan did not take part in the coordinated rate move, as its interest rates are already near zero, but the country's finance minister, Shoichi Nakagawa, welcomed the move. The Nikkei index closed down 0.5% at 9157.</p>",
  "<p>Coverage of the global financial meltdown in the wake of the credit crunch has tended to obscure reporting of events in the Middle East, a region apparently stuck in a never-ending political crunch. </p> <p>The build-up of more than 10,000 Syrian troops on the Lebanese border, nominally to \"stop smuggling\", a car bomb in Damascus, and continued fighting in and around the northern city of Tripoli, are all part of the continuing saga of poor relations between Syria and Lebanon since the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/mar/30/syria.unitednations\">2005 Syrian \"withdrawal\"</a> from Lebanese territory.</p> <p>Despite the incredible thaw in international relations with respect to Syria, including the possible offer of board membership of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Syria remains nominally in Washington's bad books. This was made clear in George Bush's speech at the United Nations last month, in which he said: \"A few nations \u2013 regimes like Syria and Iran \u2013 continue to sponsor terror, yet their numbers are growing fewer and they're growing more isolated from the world.\" </p> <p>Last week the bizarre story emerged of a US judge ordering Syria <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5g1iYvOov3NAy8y-ctyKh-wVi9BrQD93J8S780\">to pay $400m to families of contractors killed in Iraq</a>, accusing the country of supporting those in Iraq who carried out the killings. </p> <p>But with US officials now admitting to <a href=\"http://in.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idINIndia-35805020081005\">a \"reconfiguration\" in policy</a> towards Syria, it is worth asking what those Syrian connections to the Iraqi insurgency and al-Qaida linked-groups actually are. </p> <p>The American military has consistently accused Syria of allowing al-Qaida fighters to cross into Iraq through its border. Yet the crux of the debate should be whether Syrian support for such groups is active or passive. Whereas Damascus's alliance with Hizbullah can be described as an active and largely stable relationship based on a rational strategy of non-conventional proxy attacks on their enemies, the blowback from supporting jihadis for a secular Ba'athist Syrian regime is an obvious danger. </p> <p>Yet links between Damascus and certain extremist groups have been proven. Shakir al-Absi, the commander of the fundamentalist Fatah al-Islam group that clashed with the Lebanese army in the battles of the Nahr al-Barid (the Palestinian refugee) camp in 2007, used to travel around Syria in total freedom.</p> <p>It seems that today, as the Damascus car bomb proved, other Islamist groups in Lebanon are being used back against Syria \u2013 in a form of tit-for-tat jihadi proxy-battle. Indeed Lebanon's leading cleric, Dai al-Islam al-Shahal, has warned Syria to stay out of north Lebanon or risk opening \"the gates of hell\". <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/world/mideast-africa/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12342146\">The Economist</a> reported that \"after closing the borders, the Syrians got a message from the Salafists [Sunni jihadists]: you leave us alone or we target you\". </p> <p>These groups are said to have been supported by the anti-Syrian March 14 Alliance, headed by Saad Hariri, who called Syria \"a clear and direct threat\" to Lebanon. Yet he \"has been paying jihadis not to be jihadis but they've been rebelling against him\", according to Nadim Shehadi of Chatham House.</p> <p>Paradoxically, traditional American support for the March 14 anti-Syrian \u2013 and thus anti-Iranian \u2013 elements in Lebanon is thus linked to supporting al-Qaida-linked groups that the so-called war on terror is supposed to be directed against. </p> <p>Essentially Washington has found itself in a localised conflict with a bitter history that makes redundant policies such as \"with us or against us\". As the <a href=\"http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=1&amp;categ_id=2&amp;article_id=96482\">Lebanese Daily Star reported last week</a>, \"too many people in both Beirut and Damascus appear to be operating under a winner-take-all mentality that can only guarantee net losses for all concerned\". </p> <p>The Syrian regime feels an ownership of Lebanon that can almost be compared to its ally Russia's quasi-sovereign control of South Ossetia. Syria also believes that the high tide of US power in the Middle East arrived in 2005, when Syria was forced out of Lebanon, and has been in decline ever since. </p> <p>In 1990 Syria was granted de facto American support for its occupation of Lebanon in exchange for joining in the anti-Saddam coalition. Today the Syrians believe helping a weak US achieve the right conditions for withdrawal from Iraq \u2013 hence help sealing the Iraq-Syria border, achieving influence with the so-called Awakening of Sunni tribesmen, and so on \u2013 should come at a similar cost of accepting high levels of Syrian suzerainty over Lebanon. With the Hariri tribunal seemingly on the back burner and Syria actively courting its neighbours \u2013 including Israel \u2013 the US \"diplomatic reconfiguration\" may do just that.</p>",
  "<p>Want to hear a joke? An investment banker walks into a state-owned savings bank and hands over all his cash.</p> <p>You're not laughing? I bet the banker didn't look too joyous either when he deposited all his money in the much-maligned safe haven of German pensioners and petty savers. It's not a joke, by the way. Investment bankers were actually caught <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gbKv6wPwJ-cYL_rW2cZk6zGqAE6AD93LN0501\">opening savings accounts</a> at the Sparkasse in Frankfurt. It goes without saying that the new accounts are somewhat bigger than the ordinary customer's average deposit.</p> <p>The German system of private or cooperative savings banks and federal state banks has long been ridiculed by private bankers and investors. Communal institutions were the resort of the have-nots. But the financial world has been turned upside down. Even for the most adventurous gambler, security is the key these days.</p> <p>And the system offered by cooperative and savings banks is even safer than Chancellor Angela Merkel's full deposit <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/06/europe.germany\">guarantee</a> last weekend. Unlike private banks, they give guarantees for deposits without any limit \u2013 because the institution guarantee stipulates that, if one bank is at risk of failure, the other banks have to step in to save it.</p> <p>Why should savers still trust private banks if even private bankers don't? Last Sunday, Merkel announced that all deposits are safe. But there won't be any law that would enable us to enforce this guarantee by legal action.</p> <p>It is not clear yet if an admittedly strongly worded promise will restore people's trust in the safety of their savings. Who can blame those who withdraw their money and carry it to savings banks or hide it under their pillow?</p> <p>Germany is still struggling for a comprehensive answer to the crisis, and even has difficulties dealing with individual cases. Conflicting statements in the case of <a href=\"http://www.hyporealestate.com\">Hypo Real Estate</a> don't show any sign of a confidence-building crisis management. Now Hypo is even calling for an investigation into whether the minister of finance, Peer Steinbr\u00fcck, is partly to blame for the bank's misery, the Financial Times Deutschland reports. Steinbr\u00fcck had said that billions of euros in guarantees should enable the bank to be \"wound down in an orderly manner\".</p> <p>Meanwhile, the strongest advocates of the free-market economy agree that only the state can stop the downward slide of the financial markets. The European Central Bank and central banks worldwide joined the global rescue team by lowering interest rates. Germany is watching whether Britain's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/marketturmoil.creditcrunch\">\u00a350bn bail-out plan</a> succeeds with great interest. Every rescue plan that goes up in smoke will only add to the lack of trust.</p> <p>Investment bankers might have found their personal last resort in the secure deposits of communal savings banks. But the feeling in Germany is that it would be disastrous if the markets lost trust in the state as the lender of last resort.</p>",
  "<p>There are two aspects of lions that I can vouch for personally. One is that they are fearsome. When you live next door to them, they have a habit of jumping the fence and eating your dog. Paradoxically, the other is that they are boring. They are the laziest <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/wildlife\">life form</a> I have observed at any length (and I now live in the hippie epicentre that is Brighton). The typical indolent housecat is a whirlwind of energy compared to a lion. <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=-tfsL9Kq8R8\">A sloth is a dynamo.<br></a><br>By turning their lion-centric <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/bigcat/\">Big Cat Diaries</a> into the on-the-spot broadcast Big Cat Live \u2013 effectively Springwatch on the Savanna - the BBC Natural History Unit has made life difficult for itself. Things don't necessarily happen when you'd like them to: nightly, between eight and nine o'clock UK time. If not, to fill the slot they are obliged to fall back on earlier, edited footage, which may be great stuff, but undermines the promised immediacy. As a result most of the live time is taken up by the presenters, bonding over the campfire, daytime chat show-style, in a cosy fug of over-emotive anthropomorphism. They are, if anything, more enervating than the immobile lions.</p> <p>That they should be this way is not for lack of effort. Variously, presenters Kate Silverton and Simon King bring to mind MCs trying to gee up a pre-teen awards show; or maybe chance acquaintances bending your ear about their simply wonderful holiday; or Butlins redcoats. What they have in common is the breathless excitability now de rigueur in factual programming, as if the audience could not possibly pay attention to the subject without a repeated elbow in the ribs. David Attenborough, from whom this manner descends, made it thrilling because in him it was <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=CKPBCXdR6yo\">original, natural and infectious</a>. In his countless acolytes - and to be fair, those on Big Cat Live are no worse than any others - it is the opposite. It puts me in mind of a certain wide-eyed style peculiar to adolescent amateur dramatists.</p> <p>Not that I doubt the sincerity of their enthusiasm. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/kenya\">Kenya's Masai Mara</a> game reserve, where I spent many happy times in my childhood, is well worth being enthusiastic about. Anything that reveals its glories (and perhaps helps in the long run to preserve them) is to be commended. Big Cat Live is frequently enjoyable television, but it's also television that could have been so much better. The subject is a winner; there's just far too much of the people in proportion to the wildlife, and the \"live\" aspect is bound either to disappoint or to require rather sly detours.</p> <p>Let's not blame the format alone. Those Mara lions are so lethargic that as a boy I devised the sport of lion-baiting - involving a piece of foam rubber dragged by a rope - just to see them move a bit. It worked, in case you're wondering. Only too well.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Eric Hobsbawm, historian and author of The Age of Extremes</strong><br>The present ultra-free market phase of capitalism has been in crisis for some time, but until today this was not evident in the advanced western economies. It is now clearly the most serious crisis of the capitalist system since 1929-33. Nobody knows how we will get out of the depression ahead, but the current, purely national, reactions to it are inadequate. Almost certainly the rate of globalisation will slow down for a while. The slump won't feel the same as last time, as most western countries have de-industrialised, and mass unemployment may be less obvious and less visible. However, the combination of unemployment, lower incomes and higher prices is going to be is quite severe.</p> <p>Politically, the effect then was a swing to the right across the world, with the exception of Scandinavia and the US. In 1931, Labour were left with only 50 MPs in the house, and clearly now the left is very weak, so for a few years now I expect the right to dominate.</p> <p>In some ways it may be worse than the last Depression, because in those days people who did stay in their jobs benefited from low or falling prices. Now, because the cost of living, especially food and energy, is rising sharply and is unlikely to fall, even those in employment will be badly affected.</p> <p>There is nothing individuals can do except push governments to ditch their belief that the way profit-maximising business works is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/2008/oct/08/economics.creditcrunch\">a model for state and society</a>. Government action protects us and, as is now clear, will have to keep even a free market economy going in the new phase of the economic system that we are entering. But I suspect it will take a few years before the capitalist world economy, in its new phase, will find a new formula for stable growth.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/gavyndavies\">Gavyn Davies</a></strong><br>The <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/marketturmoil.creditcrunch\">semi-nationalisation</a> of the banking system is not exactly Plan A in a market economy, but it turned out to be the only option powerful enough to stand any chance of stemming the flood tide of pessimism and fear which has gripped the financial markets. The public sector balance sheet is the only one in the economy large enough to cope with this. And it may need to do much more in coming months. People are doubtful whether even the Treasury's balance sheet (ie the full faith and credit of the UK taxpayer) is strong enough to finance the likely costs. It is.</p> <p>Not only will the budgetary costs be manageable, but the Bank of England can directly create sterling assets for the banks (ie print money) if it needs to. Therefore, the danger of our major banks defaulting has diminished almost to vanishing point. The costs will be felt in the form of somewhat higher taxes in the long term, spread over many years, and an inflation rate higher than it otherwise would have been if the Bank of England eases policy too much. I am not worried about this last point. In fact, the Bank should be cutting far more aggressively.</p> <p>Interest rates are far too high at 4.5%, and deflation is a greater risk than inflation over the next two years. I doubt whether this action has come in time to stave off a painful <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/recession.globaleconomy\">recession</a>, but at least the policy response, here and elsewhere, is finally becoming commensurate with the scale of the global problem.</p> <p><strong>Howard Davies is director of the London School of Economics and Political Science</strong><br>It would be curious to give an unqualified welcome to a package that puts hundreds of billions of pounds of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/08/creditcrunch.banking\">taxpayers' money at risk</a>, and takes banks into partial public ownership. There is much experience elsewhere which supports the view that nationalising banks is a thoroughly bad idea in normal circumstances. But the circumstances are far from normal. Without recapitalisation by the state there is a serious risk that one or more of our major banks could have collapsed in a heap, with incalculable consequences for the economy. The government was right not to conduct an experiment to see precisely what those consequences would have been. </p> <p>There is much work still to do on the details of the capital injections, and the conditions to be attached to them. The government should drive a hard bargain, with strings attached covering executive pay and dividends. Thought also needs to be given to designing the exit route, which should be as easy as possible if more normal market conditions resume, and should ensure a decent return for the taxpayer to compensate for the risks she is taking on. But I am more doubtful about requiring the banks to make quantitative lending commitments to individuals or small businesses. They have a natural incentive to lend \u2013 that is how they make their money \u2013 and it would be unwise for the government to direct them to do so where they are unsure of the creditworthiness of the borrowers. That might worsen the problems the package is designed to alleviate.</p>",
  "<p>Sharif Shafei, PR supremo for a leading Dubai-based developer, can certainly talk the talk. Words like brand, vision, iconic and ambition trip easily off his tongue \u2013 all to convince you that it's business as usual in the world's hottest real estate market.</p> <p>Shafei, an engaging Egyptian-Canadian, works for a company behind huge construction projects in neighbouring Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Morocco, all cashing in on an oil-driven boom and Dubai's reputation for cutting-edge architecture, boundless imagination and high returns.</p> <p>\"I am telling people to continue to invest in real estate,\" he insisted. \"There is no bubble that's going to burst.\"</p> <p>In a week that saw panicky stock markets, falling oil prices and credit growth outstripping deposits, the brashest economy in the Middle East barely paused for breath. And with annual growth of nearly 18% since 2001, it's easy to see why. Indeed, across the Gulf, the overall real estate market has been valued at a whopping $1.3tr (\u00a3750bn).</p> <p>Property prices in Dubai have increased by 40% since January and by almost 80% in the last 18 months, though there is now some evidence of a slowdown. Worries about a downturn coincided with Dubai's annual property fair, Cityscape, which filled the cavernous World Trade Centre with eager salesmen, glittering displays of extraordinary buildings and promises of secure investments.</p> <p>The real estate company Nakheel, owned by the Dubai government, and so in effect by the ruler, Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid al-Maktoum, turned heads by unveiling plans for the world tallest tower at a cost of $38bn. But the next day Meraas Development's Jumeirah Gardens complex came in at a show-stopping $95bn.</p> <p>This is an emirate where record-busting skyscrapers and artificial islands are the norm, and which is already building the world's largest theme park and shopping mall and planning an Eiffel tower bigger than the real thing. So some people weren't that impressed.</p> <p>\"Dubai is fixated on the largest, it's a PR thing to attract attention, publicity and tourists,\" laughed Shafei. \"Dubai,\" said Sina al-Kazim, chief executive of Meraas, \"has always reinvented itself.\"</p> <p>Smooth PR, lavish entertainment and celebrities like formula one champion Michael Schumacher added lustre. Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones graced one party at the $1.5bn Atlantis Hotel on Palm Jumeirah island. Kelly Rowlands of Destiny's Child wowed guests at another flashy reception.</p> <p>But if the public message was one of unbridled confidence, there was an undercurrent of concern that didn't feature in the sales pitches, press releases and shiny brochures.</p> <p>Cityscape exhibitor Khaled al-Ali, resplendent in flowing white dishdasha and headdress among the dark suits, made no attempt to hide his fears. \"It's a bit scary,\" he admitted. \"Customer perception, misinformation and the size of the projects are all a bit too much. The wow factor makes it hard to make a decision. People believe in the companies and in Dubai but they want to know what's coming next. If banks are collapsing it might affect them.\"</p> <p>Dubai is long used to defying normal behaviour: this tiny emirate, one of the seven states of the United Arab Emirates, has an economy second in size only to regional giant Saudi Arabia, even though it has relatively little oil.</p> <p>Of its 1.3 million people, 80% are non-native foreigners, including 100,000 Britons. Many more are the south Asian labourers whose grim lives and working conditions were highlighted in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/gallery/2008/oct/08/1?picture=338366526\">Guardian</a> this week.</p> <p>Its unique status as a regional hub for business, leisure, and travel means much investment is international rather than local \u2013 and that some will see it as a safe haven in stormy times elsewhere.</p> <p>Warning signs about its property market have been visible for some time. There is concern about corruption allegations against property and banking executives. And worries too about speculative money propping up the market despite government efforts to slow rapid buying and selling, the so-called \"flipping\", of properties.</p> <p>And late last month the UAE Central Bank made $13.6bn available to maintain liquidity in the face of a local credit squeeze.</p> <p>\"On the one hand you have the fact that Dubai's government will pour as much money as is needed into any element of the economy to see it safe,\" commented one property newsletter. \"But on the other hand you have to be realistic about these things and ask, where will the people come from to live in these mega housing estates and to shop in these huge malls?\"</p> <p>Away from the futuristic towers, parts of Dubai provide glimpses of a world that is fading away: on the famous creek, lined with Iranian banks \u2013 a reminder of the brooding power across the Gulf - picturesque wooden abras nip between the dhows.</p> <p>Across the greenish water on the Deira side, opposite the British embassy and the ruler's palace, the streets have a subcontinental feel that recalls the old adage about the UAE: \"Emirates stands for English-Managed, Indian-Run, Arabs Taking Enormous Salaries.\"</p> <p>In a place built on confidence and the projection of confidence the idea of failure seems inconceivable. The consensus is that a slowdown or a \"correction\" of property prices, and delays to some existing projects, are likely, but a crash impossible. \"The message here is that it's still party time,\" says Professor Abdelkhaleq Abdullah, a political scientist. \"Everyone else is in crisis - but Dubai always sees the opportunity.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Thursday October 9 2008. In the article above we described Dubai as a country when it is an emirate. This has been corrected. </p>"
