  "<p>Rafael Ben\u00edtez believes this week's spate of managerial resignations will become the rule and not the exception of the Premier League as the new breed of wealthy club-owners demand instant returns on their mammoth investments.</p> <p>The Liverpool manager has come close to losing - and leaving - his post since Tom Hicks and George Gillett took control at Anfield and can identify with the reasons for Alan Curbishley's and Kevin Keegan's departures from West Ham and Newcastle because of his time with Valencia. Unlike Keegan and Curbishley, and in contrast to his time at the Mestalla Stadium, Ben\u00edtez retains a greater degree of control over transfers at his club, although the Americans' refusal to sanction an \u00a318m deal for Gareth Barry this summer shows there are limits to his authority.</p> <p>This week's arrival of the Abu Dhabi United Group at Manchester City has placed added pressure on Ben\u00edtez to qualify for the Champions League at a club that also demands a genuine challenge for the title this season. But, whether to meet financial or tournament targets, Ben\u00edtez believes the short-term ambitions of the new breed of owner will inevitably lead to a managerial cull.</p> <p>\"If the owners of the clubs keep on spending big, big money, then they will want more and more success. But how many teams can win the title? Just one,\" said Ben\u00edtez, whose club will be the next to fall under wealthy Arab control should Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum of Dubai finally persuade Hicks and Gillett to sell. \"So the rest of the teams who spend big money, the owners will realise they haven't won, so it could be more pressure and more problems for everyone. City will start the season under pressure from the first minute, but everyone knows you can't win every game. It will be a problem because four or five teams will spend big money, and only one can win.</p> <p>\"As a manager, you have to analyse things properly, because you aren't a fan. You can't just say what people want to hear. The Premier League is becoming more and more difficult because so many people are spending money. For us to qualify for the Champions League for five years in a row is important for a club of our stature. We want to win trophies, and to win the Premier League would be amazing. But it's not easy.\"</p> <p>Dubai's \u00a3400m offer for Liverpool remains on the Americans' table. Last week work on a proposed new stadium on Stanley Park was postponed due to the global economic crisis raising doubts over Hicks' and Gillett's ability to refinance their takeover next year.</p> <p>Ben\u00edtez also suspects the growing trend for technical directors at English clubs, a system that prompted his departure from Valencia and lay behind Keegan's exit at Newcastle, will also weaken manager's positions. \"I have some experience in Spain with this system, and I think the relationship has to be good. That is the key,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Strange but true: every year, as I <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/treasury-hijacks-funds-meant-for-green-causes-518865.html\">revealed</a> three years ago, the Treasury raids the mysterious \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/aug/09/greenpolitics.politics\">NFFO fund</a>\" to the tune of hundreds of millions of pounds, on the most tenuous of legal grounds: that the enormous surpluses it generates are a \"hereditary revenue of the Crown\", along with the income arising from treasure trove and the Crown's prerogative rights over royal fish and birds \u2013 sturgeons and swans.</p> <p>This medieval and so far unchallenged legal doctrine has created the very stealthiest of all stealth taxes, invisibly and unknowingly paid by all of us in our electricity bills \u2013 purportedly to support renewable electricity generation.</p> <p>In this time of rocketing energy prices, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/06/economy.energy\">today's news</a> that the government's \"windfall tax\" \u2013 paid by us, not the energy companies \u2013 will reach \u00a3200m this year alone, and may exceed \u00a31bn by 2010, may be the nail in this iniquitous tax's coffin. And our first demand must be this: the money is raised from our bills in order to support renewable electricity generation, so let it be spent for that purpose and for that purpose only.</p> <p>There are two major areas that need substantial additional funding. One is to modernise and extend the grid, which was always designed to carry electricity from big power stations, mainly in the north, and deliver it to consumers according to generally predictable patterns of generation and consumption. But renewables are different. Wind, wave and tidal resources are mainly located on the UK's western seaboard, far away from the grid's main powerlines. And a radical redesign is needed to make the grid able to cope with the inherently unpredictable nature of renewables, especially as their contribution soars from the current paltry few percent of supply.</p> <p>We also need additional support for the new renewables frontier: the sea. We will soon run out of suitable locations for wind turbines on our small and scenic island, and the bulk of new wind power must surely go offshore where there is plenty of wind but no precious landscapes to spoil. The problem is, of course, that extra costs are involved in developing offshore renewables \u2013 whether wind, wave or tidal stream \u2013 in construction, maintenance and grid connections.</p> <p>But more fundamentally the scale of the surplus reveals something important about the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jun/25/renewableenergy.carbonemissions\">renewables obligation</a>, the current system for supporting renewable electricity generation: its remarkably high cost. The NFFO fund surplus <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/aug/09/greenpolitics.politics\">arises from</a> the difference in price between the fixed-price contracts that were being handed out to renewables generators in the 1980s and 1990s under the non fossil fuel obligation, and the far higher prices available to renewable generators now under the renewables obligation (RO), which came into force in 2002.</p> <p>It works like this: the electricity is bought under the old NFFO contracts by the Non Fossil Purchasing Agency, which sells it on to electricity suppliers under the new regime, together with the associated renewable obligation certificates (ROCs). The difference in price is put into the NFFO fund, which is looked after by <a href=\"http://www.ofgem.gov.uk/Pages/OfgemHome.aspx\">Ofgem</a>. Then, every autumn, the government grabs the surplus and shoves into the consolidated fund, the Treasury's main pot of cash for general expenditures.</p> <p>So, this tells us that we are paying far, far more for renewable electricity under the new system than we were under the old. And for what benefit? None. The NFFO system had its problems, mainly that it operated on a competitive basis that pushed the cost down so low that many \"winning\" schemes were never actually built. But at least it offered one thing investors were looking for: the certainty of a fixed-price contract that developers could take to the bank and get financed.</p> <p>By contrast, the new RO system is both ineffective and expensive. It operates by way of a complex market-driven approach that creates considerable uncertainty as to the future price. If renewable developers significantly undershoot the renewables target for a given year, then ROC prices are high and they make out like bandits \u2013 much as they are doing now. But if they develop too much and go over target, then the ROC price collapses and some unfortunates will be left holding worthless pieces of paper. On top of that, investors have to reckon with all the uncertainties over the electricity price itself. So, the developers and investors demand a substantial risk premium \u2013 for which we have to pay in our bills \u2013 and targets are significantly undershot.</p> <p>The RO is, therefore, a poor delivery mechanism for the UK's far more ambitious future targets for renewable energy. In order to meet the EU's target that 20% of all energy supply be renewable by 2020, the UK will probably need to produce 35-40% of its electricity from renewable sources, and the RO is simply not fit for purpose. It will need to be scrapped and replaced with something far more effective, that delivers far better public value. The obvious answer is to give out fixed-price contracts set at fair prices, not on the competitive basis that undermined the NFFO.</p> <p>Germany's phenomenal recent expansion of renewables, including both wind and solar PV, based on this successful approach, shows us that it could work here, too.</p>",
  "<p>Driving northeast from Gobabis, a desolate town outside the Kalahari desert, was like journeying to the edge of the world. The stillness of infinite skies and scorched earth was otherworldly. The only signs of life amid the tufts of dried grass, skeletal trees and giant vultures' nests, were scatterings of goats, feral dogs, buzzards and flies. But at the end of this long, lonely road was an unexpected oasis. Set in the stark, wild beauty of Namibia, the Harnas Wildlife Sanctuary is home to 400 animals and boasts Angelina Jolie as its patron and regular visitor. Jolie filmed part of Beyond Borders here, and fell in love with the big cats, leaving a \u00a3200,000 donation for its wild animal release project. This one-of-a-kind family-run refuge has a working-guest scheme designed to fulfil eco-tourists' dreams of doing hands-on work with wild animals and attracts volunteers from all over the world.</p> <p>At the entrance beneath the footbridge, fat, lazy crocodiles basked in a low, open pen as a pair of calico cats played among them. Amazingly, there were also dozens of domestic dogs and about 60 moggies that appeared not to have any difficulties with the big cats or other large creatures. Crossing the lush lawns at the heart of the sanctuary, the first animals to greet us were Rudy, a blesbok calf abandoned by his mother, and another orphan, Klippie, an eight-month-old giraffe. Surveying us with her lovely, liquid-black eyes, she was mesmerised by my husband Tiz and followed us into the open-air restaurant. About 50 chattering mongoose ambushed us, one of them climbing into my bag and running off with my stash of banana chips.</p> <p>Before we got a chance to settle in, we were invited on the evening feeding-run, taking carcasses to 18 lions, 30 cheetahs, 35 wild dogs and dozens of leopards and caracals. The predators are fed every day. The tamer cats get personalised bowls, while legs from sheep, donkeys and horses are thrown out to the untouchables who will eventually be returned to the wild; and modest bits and pieces for smaller creatures. Driving to the various semi-wild enclosures, we sat in the back of a rusty old pick-up with three other volunteers - Nora, a German model, Chris, a London oil executive, and Barbara, a literature professor from Arizona, who is writing a book on Harnas - surrounded by large metal tins filled with body parts. Tiz looked mournfully at the bucket of goats' heads wedged between his legs.</p> <p>After this bloody feast, we sat down to a home-made vegan casserole under the thatched canopy of the open-air restaurant, overlooking the swimming pool and cheetah enclosure. Watching five cheetahs, silhouetted in the sunset, playing chasing games, I was captivated. Tiz was chilled, with a cat in his lap and a blesbok at his feet, drinking beer and smoking, and catching snatches of conversation from a middle-aged couple beside us, who were here as guests rather than volunteers. She was French, chic and chiselled, and looked like she had blown in from the slopes of St Moritz. Her American filmmaker husband was eating steak and shouting into his mobile phone: \"It has all the cliches of hip-hop. The gold Mercedes. Black dwarves. Naked whores . . .\"</p> <p>On the way back to our lodge, a ragtag assortment of wood-and-stone huts, we picked up a pair of moggies, whom we christened Ronald and Nancy. The lodge is rustic with unpainted walls and stone floors, but small luxuries such as a copper bath and white linen make it comfortable and the views are mesmerising. We sat on our rickety porch in silence with our feline guests, gazing out on to the landscape brilliantly illuminated by a full moon. Just beyond the spidery trees, we could hear the rustling in the underbrush and the chattering and yowling of countless creatures. Warthogs snorted and snuffled around a mudhole, kudu and springbok silently weaved through the grasslands like ghosts, their eyes glowing in the inky-blue darkness.</p> <p>Later, lying in bed, we realised how open we were to the elements. \"You can hear the lions roaring from here at night,\" Juan, the sanctuary caretaker, had told us soon after our arrival. The lion roars were uncomfortably close; their compound was, in fact, next door.</p> <p>After breakfast the next day, the owner, Marieta van der Merwe, introduced us to the 50-odd baboons in their enclosures, which are divided by age groups. Baby baboons, the size of housecats, are funny, naughty and joyful. They're also skilful thieves with magpie sensibilities. The moment I stepped inside, Jacob, the baboon without a tail, snatched my diamant\u00e9 flip-flops, while his mate ran off with a bag of apples meant to be treats. When I put up a fight for my shoes, Jacob bit me, bruising my hand. Marieta has raised hundreds of baboons over the years and easily sweet-talked Jacob into returning my shoes.</p> <p>All the rescues at Harnas have names and are treated as family by the staff and volunteers, who regularly share their beds with lion cubs or baby baboons swaddled in nappies, or sleep beneath the stars with big cats. Cheetahs, leopards and baboons, considered a nuisance by farmers, are routinely shot, often leaving orphans behind. \"My dream is to return as many animals as we can back into the wild,\" said Marieta. \"But most of them come here because people have shot their mums or raised them as pets and then dumped them. Some have lost limbs or eyes.\"</p> <p>Harnas, which means sanctuary in Afrikaans, began in 1978 when Marieta and her cattle-farmer husband Nick persuaded a man on a dusty Namibian road to give them an emaciated vervet monkey for a few cents. After years of struggles and small miracles, it has evolved into southern Africa's largest wildlife orphanage. Along with a handful of staff and Bushmen (Namibia's indigenous, displaced Sans people), an army of volunteers, mostly young Europeans and Americans, keep the place running.</p> <p>Over the years, the van der Merwes gained a reputation for rescuing animals and would get calls from across the country to fetch orphaned or injured creatures. They also took in a pride of lions left homeless after the closure of a South African zoo. \"I was so in love with animals, I couldn't say no,\" said Marieta. \"We ended up with a lot and were always running out of money.\"</p> <p>Soon the couple began selling off parcels of land on their 100,000-acre cattle farm and allowing the tamer big cats and predators to appear in films and commercials. But when Nick died of Congo fever in 2001 the family - and the animals - faced an uncertain future. Shortly after her husband's death, Marieta opened the guesthouses to volunteers.</p> <p>At sundown, we joined Marieta on her afternoon stroll with the adult baboons. Sensing my wariness, she reassured me the adults are calmer. But as soon as they were let out, they scattered across the lawns, up trees, grabbing everything in sight like looters in a riot - paw-paws, pumpkins and grass shoots. \"Don't worry, if they misbehave I have my secret weapon,\" she said, whipping out a plastic snake from her pocket.</p> <p>That evening, five English volunteers wandered off on a nature walk and got lost. After a five-hour search they were found in the desert. \"It can be a bit crazy here,\" says Schalk, Marieta's son who grew up on the farm and still lives here with his young family. \"Every day something happens. The crocodile often gets out and ends up in the swimming pool. The wild dogs dig their way out and have to be caught. A puff adder wanders into the bar and has to be relocated.\"</p> <p>Another morning we ran into bat-eared foxes on some mysterious errand and Goeters, the 21-year-old cheetah and star of many films, slinking among the poppies in the van der Merwe's back garden. Marieta ushered us into the welcoming fug of her kitchen, where we met more of her extended family. She was warming up milk for Grace, a premature three-week-old baboon, strapped to her waist. The owl who lived above the table was flying around. Tara, a fat, blonde labrador who has nursed many lions and leopards, was snoring on a shabby sofa, while a palm-sized piglet stirred up the dirt in a litter box. Cats and dogs streamed in and out, folding themselves into corners. </p> <p>Later in the day, we helped Schalk's wife Jo at the school that the family runs for the Bushmen community living on the farm. Dusty, ecstatic children, between the ages of three and seven, streamed into the classroom behind the horse stables. They were tiny and fine-boned like gazelles. They adored Tiz and thought he was a movie-star like Brad Pitt who had visited some months before.</p> <p>On our last day, Schalk took us on the famous lion walk, along with Marieta's cousin Frikke, a chain-smoking, hard-drinking Afrikaans who works as a volunteer coordinator. He had recently suffered a heart attack but had left the hospital early because he missed the animals. The two tame lions, Zion and Trust, were thrilled to see us.</p> <p>Schalk, a former international rugby star for Namibia, had brought up the two lions in his house along with his two small children. He loaded Zion on to the truck while his brother, who lately has fallen into the habit of jumping on people, was left behind. After driving into the wilderness, we walked alongside Zion as he zig-zagged from person to person, brushing against us like a giant pussycat. But then, fast as lightning, he ran off. He could smell the feral cows that had been left to go wild on the land once the family turned the centuries-old cattle farm into a full-time sanctuary. Within moments, we were whisked away in a battered, petrol-leaking Ford. Apparently, lions, even tame ones, become dangerous once in hunting mode. Zion had attacked one of the cows. We raced away in a cloud of petrol fumes and dust.</p> <p>As the sky turned violent, sparkling with stars, we gave the black lamb, whom Marieta named Britt, her late-night bottle, then put her to bed in the wicker-pen in the van der Merwe's kitchen, where she curled up with the tiny piglet, now called Tiz, who had become her inseparable companion. After dinner, we swapped stories with some of the other volunteers about the day's mishaps and dramas, before walking back to our cottage one last time, with a scruffy little white dog called Bubbles, his one-eyed mother Uma and a limping black mongrel Kiera who lost one of her fore-paws to a hyena. Waiting on the porch, Ronald and Nancy looked unhappy with our new guests. I was unhappy too, to be leaving.

  "<p>The dawn of the cold war was literally freezing. The winter of 1947 was the worst ever recorded in Europe. From January to late March, it opened a front across Russia, Germany, Italy, France and Britain, and advanced with complete lack of mercy. Snow fell in St Tropez, gale-force winds building up impenetrable drifts; ice floes drifted to the mouth of the Thames; barges bringing coal into Paris became icebound. There, the philosopher Isaiah Berlin found himself \"terrified\" by the city's coldness, \"empty and hollow and dead, like an exquisite corpse\". A slight thaw was followed by a further freeze-up, locking canals and roads under a thick layer of ice. In Berlin, Willy Brandt described how the icy cold \"attacked people like a savage beast\". Ghostly figures roamed parks looking for benches to cut up into firewood. The Tiergarten was hacked down to stumps, its statues left standing in a wilderness of frozen mud; the woods in the famous Gr\u00fcnewald were completely razed.</p> <p>Just as American journalist Walter Lippmann coined the phrase \"cold war\", the weather cruelly drove home its physical reality, carving its way into the new, post-Yalta topography of Europe, its national territories and populations mutilated, its ideologies braced in antagonistic poses. The Soviets were swift to move in behind the cold front, grasping the potential of the widespread instability of postwar Europe. With an energy and resourcefulness which showed that Stalin's regime could avail itself of an imaginative vigour unmatched by western governments, the Soviet Union deployed a battery of unconventional weapons to nudge itself into the European consciousness and soften up opinion in its favour.</p> <p>Experts in the use of culture as a tool of political persuasion, the Soviets did much in the early years of the cold war to establish its central paradigm as a cultural one. Lacking the economic power of the United States and, above all, still without a nuclear capability, they concentrated on winning \"the battle for men's minds\". America, despite a massive marshalling of the arts in the New Deal period, was a virgin in the practice of international Kulturkampf. But such innocence was soon to be forfeited in what high-level US strategists were already calling \"the greatest polarisation of power on earth\" (space, for a few years yet, was off-limits) since Rome and Carthage. \"We have to show the outside world that we have a cultural life and that we care something about it,\" the diplomat George Kennan told an audience at New York's Museum of Modern Art. \"I for one would willingly trade the entire remaining inventory of political propaganda for the results that could be achieved by this.\"</p> <p>And so it was that, against the backdrop of Europe's bombed-out cities, with all basic infrastructures in a state of collapse, a weirdly elaborate cultural life was constructed by the two superpowers as they vied with each other to score propaganda points. As early as 1945, when the stench of human bodies still hung about the ruins of Berlin, the Russians were staging brilliant performances at the State Opera, pomaded generals listening smugly to Gluck's Orpheus, punctuating the music with the tinkle of their medals. The Americans returned fire, opening the Amerika-H\u00e4user, comfortably furnished (and heated) institutes offering film showings, concerts, talks and art shows, all with \"overwhelming emphasis on America\". Within a few years, the arsenal of unconventional weapons with which each side conducted its offensive and defensive operations had swollen to include highbrow literary magazines, paintings, sculptures, comic books, motorcycles, fashion, chess, sports, architecture, design. Everything, in truth (and this is what both sides claimed to have the monopoly on), including the kitchen sink.</p> <p>The kitchen as a site of ideological conflict was pointedly iterated by the \"Kitchen Debate\" between then US vice-president Nixon and Soviet premier Khrushchev at the American National Exhibition, staged in Moscow in 1959. The encounter - over a lemon yellow kitchen designed by General Electric - still registers as one of the iconic moments of the cold war. \"Would it not be better to compete in the relative merits of washing machines than in the strength of rockets? Is this the kind of competition you want?\" Nixon challenged Khrushchev. \"We too have such things,\" Khrushchev bragged, though he failed to mention that the \"we\" was far from all-inclusive. Of the estimated 2.7 million visitors to the Moscow exhibition, only a fraction would have the opportunity to possess the kind of commodities on display. </p> <p>\"Refrigerator socialism\", harnessed as it was to a command economy, was never as widely available - or quite as attractive - as capitalism's glossy counterpart. But this was not the point: as Nixon and Khrushchev's sharp exchange shows, the question was whether items in the kitchen were mere domestic appliances, or rather the cultural equivalents of ballistic missiles, offensive weapons in the war of ideas. As the American National Exhibition explicitly stressed, a kitchen was no longer just a kitchen, but an enclave where \"liberty and the pursuit of happiness\" - the prizes of the Enlightenment, no less - could be attained through panel-controlled washing machines and electric waste grinders.</p> <p>The Kitchen Debate has been endlessly recycled as a story of basic antinomies to evoke the black-and-white, them-and-us chequerboard of cold war politics. Cold War Modern, edited by David Crowley and Jane Pavitt, and accompanying the V&amp;A exhibition they have curated, introduces a more sophisticated narrative that explores the interstices of this all-too-familiar grid. American officials in charge of the American National Exhibition reported breathlessly on its \"overwhelming success\". But the visitors' comment books, according to design historian Susan Reid, reveal an ambivalent response: \"And this is one of the greatest nations?? I feel sorry for the Americans ... Does your life really consist of only kitchens?\" This is one among many critical entries. A small charge, but enough to detonate the official victor's history that the \"freedoms\" and innovations offered by the American National Exhibition were such to make all Soviet citizens salivate and long for more of the same. </p> <p>Was the American assembly line better than the Communist party line? Was the organisation of society around individual rather than collective desires or needs intrinsically superior? The designer Raymond Loewy, in a 1950 speech to Harvard Business School, was in no doubt: \"The citizens of Lower Slobovia may not give a hoot for freedom of speech, but how they fall for a gleaming Frigidaire, a stream-lined bus or a coffee percolator.\" Possibly, but within a few years his fictional Lower Slobovians could drool over a P70 coup\u00e9 with a Duroplast body (the prototype of the Trabant), or a Messerschmitt Kabinenroller KR200, or Hedwig Bollhagen's beautiful, Bauhaus-inspired black ceramic coffee set - all cold war classics produced behind the iron curtain. Or maybe people on both sides of the ideological divide actually preferred something altogether different - mock-Tudor, or German Gothic, or whatever was knocking about in the cutlery drawer. These vernaculars may not satisfy the narrative arc of \"Cold War Modern\", and the \"questions of existence\" - Existenzfragen - it posed, but they all coexisted and competed with it.</p> <p>Loewy, who worked as an industrial design consultant for Nasa in the 1970s, aligned himself as working not just in, but for the cold war, and hence saw things in rather simplistic binaries. But by the time of the Kitchen Debate, these binaries had lost their edge. Khrushchev had long since denounced Stalin, in the least secret \"secret\" speech ever made, and commenced the thaw that introduced a less restrictive, if still state-controlled, cultural agenda. Socialist realism, \"the mask of Stalinism\", was, if not a thing of the past, no longer the sole official art. Indeed, it makes only a brief appearance in the V&amp;A exhibition (principally, the huge tapestry depicting the reconstruction of Warsaw, woven by students at the State High School of Fine Art in Lodz). In parallel, and somewhat counterintuitively, this was the moment when abstract expressionism, deployed as \"free enterprise\" painting by the cultural cartel of MoMA and the CIA, became fixed as the art officiel of the west, leading one American critic to complain that realists had to \"live in basements and pass still lifes around like samizdat\". We can savour the delicious irony now, but at the time, and with so much at stake, the cultural cold war was a terribly po-faced affair.</p> <p>Khrushchev's intervention in architecture also powerfully debunked the Stalin-era aesthetic, whose \"American\" skyscraper projects were one of the more bizarre inversions of the cold war. There were to be no more cathedrals in the cult of personality, with their classical cornices, lintels and ornamented porticoes (the Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw is the example par excellence of these encrusted towers). Where Stalin's vicious cultural tsar Andrei Zhdanov had denounced modernist architecture as \"shapeless boxes\" expressing the \"hunger of monopoly capitalism\", obliterating all national character and destroying valuable historical complexes, Khrushchev now sanctioned the return of this style. Less, he said, was more, and he ordered architects to replace cornices with conscience, to deliver affordable, functional living environments worthy of the citizen of the Soviet utopia. What was delivered, on a massive scale, was more and more of less and less: endless avenues of prefab, multi-storeyed blocks, of weeping concrete and mildewed panel walls. Cold War Modern, as applied to mass housing, really meant \"more modernism\" - and it was a miserable legacy.</p> <p>In another context, however, Cold War Modern produced some architectural miracles. The Ostankino television tower in Moscow (1967-69), a scale model of which has been commissioned for the V&amp;A show, projects a dizzying, optimistic vision, a technotopia. Such telecommunication towers, which sprung up in both east and west, combined technical wizardry with gravity-defying engineering. Important gauges in cold war competition, they served twin functions as high-tech instruments and visual symbols of power. Designed to attract the public, they typically included viewing decks, restaurants and hotels, features of the leisure economy. Like the Eiffel tower, they cast an irrational spell, becoming the focus of dreams and bodily pleasures - in the reach for mythical status, both the Ostankino tower and the East Berlin Fernsehturm were staffed by air hostesses dressed in synthetic uniforms. Because of its unique position in a partitioned city that had physically internalised the divisive logic of the cold war, the Fernsehturm acquired another set of meanings: for the communists, it was a crow's nest in a sea occupied by enemy powers; for the citizens of East Germany, denied the right to leave their own country, it provided a tantalising view across the wall into the lost domain of freedom.</p> <p>As the cold war progressed, much of its basic premise - of antithesis and constructed antagonism - was paradoxically both accelerated and undermined by such technological advances. Sputnik, which beeped its message of Soviet ascendancy in the space race across the world in 1957, also announced the beginning of what Marshall McLuhan famously dubbed \"the global village\", of a world connected by the \"cosmic web\" of communication technology. While much of this technology emanated from the highly competitive field of military research, it produced a kind of invisible membrane that covered both sides of the cold war divide. Earth, and now the space that surrounded it, was connected by technologies developed to enforce the ideology of separateness. This paradox encouraged optimism and despair in equal measure. As the philosopher Hannah Arendt observed in 1958, Sputnik signalled a modern desire to use human artifice to escape our earthbound condition. While some viewed this as the shape of the future, for Arendt this escape into artifice represented the path to worldly alienation. </p> <p>Escape - from ideology and its deadening diktats, from the threat of nuclear irradiation, from the industrial overload of the ecosystem - is inscribed in the genetic code of Cold War Modern. It's in Jackson Pollock's splurgy, tangled lines that reach across and over the edges of his canvases; it's in Eero Saarinen's Womb Chair (1948), a cocoon in which the body can hide; it's in the crypts, caves and bunkers drawn up by architects as they searched underground, beneath the sea, in space, for other habitats. Or in architect-designer Buckminster Fuller's defensive geodesic domes, and the bubble he drew covering part of Manhattan (1962); or in Oasis 7, a giant inflatable environment suspended in mid-air, complete with small beach and palm tree (by Viennese architects Haus-Rucker-Co, 1972). Powerful commentaries, all, on the fear of Doomsday and the attempts to survive or even domesticate it. </p> <p>If fallout was about anxiety, dropout was a kind of defiant rebuttal. Buckminster Fuller's geodesic domes reappeared as hippy homes in Colorado's Drop City (1965-73), no longer futuristic membranes but present-day dwellings assembled, like colourful globular shanties, from discarded car parts and other junk. A retreat from consumerism and assembly lines that, playfully, ironically, reassembled the bits and recycled them out of their own obsolescence into a new living environment.

  "<p>Swaths of Britain were on flood alert last night as the first of the autumn storms lashed the country, causing road and rail chaos and leaving scores of householders mopping up yet again.</p> <p>The worst of the weather was in the south-west, where two people were killed in a car crash in driving rain, and in Wales, where rivers rose to hazardous levels after 50mm of rain fell in 24 hours on ground that was already saturated.</p> <p>Last night a 17-year-old girl died after the four-by-four she was in overturned and plunged into a swollen river in Mid Wales, Dyfed-Powys Police said.</p> <p>RAF helicopters airlifted three of the vehicle's occupants to hospital in Aberystwyth. Two of them were suffering from hypothermia, but the girl, who has not been named, died on arrival.</p> <p>There were two severe flood warnings, meaning \"extreme danger\" to lives and property, on the rivers Taff and Rhymney in south Wales and a further 25 flood warnings and 62 flood watches across Britain.</p> <p>Environment Agency and Met Office experts warned that the bad weather was likely to continue into next week, which could lead to more serious flooding.</p> <p>Areas that have so far escaped relatively unscathed, such as parts of northern England, Northern Ireland and southern Scotland, can expect to start getting their share of heavy rain today.</p> <p>In Lydney, Gloucestershire, residents were mopping up homes for the third time in 14 months. Homes were devastated by floods last year and were back under water in January. Carol Pritchard, 65, watched helplessly as once more water rushed into her house. She said: \"This is horrendous, far worse than last time - the water came through the house like a river. It has taken seven months to get everything sorted after last time. Now everything has been ruined and we've got to start all over again. I don't want to live here any more, but we have nowhere else to go.\"</p> <p>James Bevan, a local councillor, claimed the government was diverting money needed to shore up Lydney's flood defences to places such as Tewkesbury, cut off during last summer's floods.</p> <p>Last night many roads in Worcestershire and Herefordshire were swamped. Motorists in Wales were forced to seek refuge on their car roofs .</p> <p>John Mosedale, from the Environment Agency Wales, said the country faced the worst risk of flooding for 30 years. South Wales fire and rescue service had dealt with 410 flood-related calls by early evening.</p> <p>Barry Rowe, 29, and Rebecca Hoynes, 30, were killed when their car struck a tree in Plymouth in driving rain. At Bere Alston, Devon, a man was rescued by firefighters after a tree branch trapped him in his van and left him with a neck injury.</p> <p>The weather ruined end-of-summer events across the country. In Bristol plans to create a four-tonne ice replica of Isambard Kingdom Brunel's Clifton suspension bridge were scrapped due to the driving rain. A jazz in the park event due alongside the Afon Llwyd river in Pontypool, south Wales, was called off after three marquees flooded. The Moreton-in-Marsh agricultural show due tomorrow has been cancelled due to waterlogged grounds.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Met Office said: \"There is the risk that any further heavy rainfall will run off the ground and go straight into the rivers. As a result, we could see the levels in watercourses responding very quickly, so we urge people to remain vigilant.\"</p> <h2>Forecast</h2> <p><strong>Today</strong></p> <p>Bright intervals and scattered heavy showers across most of England and Wales.

  "<p><strong>RSA Insurance Group</strong> and confectionery company<strong> Cadbury</strong> both bucked another slide in the market yesterday, but overall the FTSE 100 index recorded its worst week for six years on growing economic worries.</p> <p>The widely watched US non-farm payroll numbers showed that 84,000 jobs were lost in August, higher than most forecasts of a 75,000 drop. Both June and July's job losses were revised upwards.</p> <p>On top of the US figures, a warning from Nokia, the world's largest mobile phone maker, that consumer caution would hit its trading added to the growing concerns about the state of the global economy. So with Wall Street more than 80 points lower by the time London closed - following Thursday's 344 point drop - the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> ended 121.4 points lower at 5240.7. Since Monday, the index has fallen by nearly 400 points, or 7%, a weekly loss not seen since July 2002 when the index dropped 8.48%. Miners were the main losers, as commodity prices fell to reflect the prospect of falling demand as economic growth declines. <strong>Kazakhmys</strong> lost 86.5p to 975.5p, rival <strong>Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation</strong> was down 66.5p to 805.5p and <strong>Ferrexpo</strong> - likely to lose its place in the leading index next week - fell 14p to 184p. Platinum specialist <strong>Johnson Matthey</strong> was the biggest loser in the FTSE 100, down 134p to \u00a314.41 after a downgrade from Merrill Lynch.</p> <p>But insurer RSA closed 4.5p higher at 162.8p as takeover talk refused to die down. Germany's Allianz and Zurich Financial Services were both mentioned as possible predators, as was Italy's Generali. Traders were talking of a price tag of around 195p a share.</p> <p>As for Cadbury, it added 14p to 636p on talk it was moving closer to selling its Australian drinks business. Analysts said the division, which could be worth up to \u00a3500m, had been looking increasingly out of place since the company spun off its US beverages operations as Dr Pepper earlier this year.</p> <p>Back among the fallers, banks continued to suffer on further worries about more credit crunch write-offs. This week's news that the European Central Bank was restricting the use of its emergency liquidity scheme also hit sentiment. Goldman Sachs did not help by issuing a sell note on rival Merrill Lynch, while Dresdner Kleinwort predicted that despite the recent spate of rights issues, banks would have to ask investors for more cash next year to support their balance sheets.</p> <p>So <strong>Barclays </strong>fell 12p to 317.25p as Collins Stewart issued a sell note ahead of a presentation on 15 September by the bank's president, Bob Diamond. The broker said: \"We remain concerned about some big numbers on the balance sheet, for example the \u00a35bn of leveraged finance and \u00a311bn of commercial mortgages left.\" <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> slipped 8p to 219.75p, while <strong>HBOS</strong> lost 7p to 275.5p.</p> <p>Supermarket group <strong>J Sainsbury </strong>was also among the losers, down 11.5p to 336p. Deutsche Bank moved from hold to sell and cut its price target from 335p to 310p, reflecting tougher times for the sector generally and the growing trend of customers to trade down from Sainsbury to discounters such as Aldi and Lidl.</p> <p>Former government minister Patricia Hewitt - who joined the board of <strong>BT</strong> in March with a \u00a360,000 a year salary - has just paid \u00a35,000 to buy 2,830 shares. But the news had little effect on BT, which closed 3.4p lower at 169.1p.</p> <p>Among the mid-caps, publishing group <strong>Informa</strong> fell back folllowing its after-hours rejection on Thursday of a 450p offer from a consortium including Carlyle Group and Providence Equity Partners. Despite analysts suggesting the consortium could return with a slightly higher offer of perhaps 475p, Informa closed 28.75p lower at 385.75p.</p> <p>The Nokia warning sent shares in <strong>CSR</strong>, the bluetooth specialist which supplies mobile phone companies, tumbling 21.75p to 305.25p. Comet owner <strong>Kesa Electricals</strong> slipped 3.5p to 147.5p as JP Morgan cut its profit forecasts, partly to reflect a deterioration in the company's French business, and reduced its price target from 200p to 185p.</p> <p>But Russia-focused oil and gas producer <strong>Imperial Energy</strong> jumped 25p to \u00a311.55 on hopes that a takeover from India's state-owned ONGC could be concluded within the next four or five weeks.</p> <p>On Aim, <strong>Churchill Mining</strong> climbed 7.5p to 66.5p on news that its East Kutai Coal project in Indonesia had reached 1.4bn tonnes of thermal coal, well ahead of its 500m target for 2008.</p> <p>Blue Oar analyst Alison Stent said: \"This is incredible news for Churchill. The 1.4bn tonne resource has been defined from drilling over only 20% of the total target area suggesting substantial further upside.\"</p> <p>Medical equipment group <strong>Lombard Medical Technologies</strong> slumped 71% to 1.875p despite the company saying the fall was not a reflection of any change in its circumstances. It repeated that it was in discussions with a number of potential investors and expected new funds to be agreed in the coming months.</p> <h2>Racing Carr's</h2> <p>In contrast to most unscheduled updates - which tend to be profit warnings - Carr's Milling Industries yesterday issued its <strong>fourth upgrade in four months</strong>. Carr's, which supplies feed and fertilisers to farmers, is <strong>benefiting from rising food prices</strong> and now expects to make \u00a312.5m for this year, up from \u00a35.5m last year. Some \u00a34m came from one-offs such as foreign exchange gains, but house broker Investec said underlying trading was strong and issued a <strong>buy note</strong> with a 760p target. Carr's has raised \u00a32.7m for working capital with a 660p-a-share placing. It closed <strong>15p higher at 677.5p</strong>.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:nick.fletcher@theguardian.com\"><br>nick.fletcher@theguardian.com</a></p> <p>Market Forces Live at: <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/markets\">blogs.theguardian.com/markets</a></p>",
  "<p>Some Amsterdammers may still giggle when De Baarsjes gets mentioned as an up-and-coming neighbourhood. Even though it's just a 10-minute bike ride from the centre, it has a reputation for being an edgy spot, where youths hang out around the Mercatorplein square.</p> <p>De Baarsjes is one of the city's most multicultural 'hoods with 126 different nationalities, dominated by Surinamese, Turkish and Moroccan families. It's the ultimate place to go for quality cheap ethnic food. Pera (Jan Evertsenstraat 86, 0031 20-683 4311) is an excellent Turkish grill, while Farasa (Jan van Galenstraat 287, +20-612 6650) has one of the best Surinamese roti in the city.</p> <p>However, the scene is changing, thanks to a growth of style-conscious mid-range restaurants and bars set up to cater for the increasing number of students and creatives who have been attracted by the area's cheap rents and stash of one-bedroom apartments.</p> <p>While much of the area is generic pre-war housing, it has some architectural gems. The quarter between the canal Admiralengracht and the Surinameplein is part of the 1920s idealistic urban expansion Plan West, which combined social housing with Gaud\u00ed-esque brickwork, best exemplified in the De Sieraad, Mercatorplein, and the nearby church Jeruzulumkerk (Jan Maijenstraat 14, <a href=\"http://www.jeruzalem-kerk.nl\">jeruzalem-kerk.nl</a>).</p> <p>The neighbourhood made global headlines in 2006 when the local council put up signs prohibiting the smoking of marijuana in public in and around Mercatorplein. It had hoped they would reduce the number of loitering youths and petty crime, but the only resulting change in crime rates was an increase in stealing - of the signs. The depiction of two fingers holding a joint with marijuana leaves spiralling up in a cloud of smoke was the perfect bedroom wall decoration. To combat the problem, the district officials offered the iconic signs for sale at \u20ac90 each (the fine for stealing one was \u20ac80). </p> <h2>Mercatorplein</h2> <p>The internationally renowned architect HP Berlage was responsible for this square, finished in 1927. Its rocketing corner towers were removed in 1961 due to safety issues, then after decades of going downhill, the square was renovated in 1998 and the towers rebuilt.</p> <h2>Witte de Withstraat</h2> <p>The term \"gallery strip\" does not immediately pop into mind as one wanders this nondescript street, but that is what it's becoming. Pioneers Illuseum (no 120, illuseum.com) were derided as freaks when they first set up their space here before the area got cool, and they keep that tradition alive with left-field art exhibitions and events that usually include a levitating magician or two. In sharp contrast, HoofdzaakHoeden (no 168, <a href=\"http://www.hoofdzaakhoeden.nl\">hoofdzaakhoeden.nl</a>) sells hats and the limited-edition couture of the label ArtWear. Keep your eyes peeled for the outlet of \"art co-op\" Zoete Broodjes (no 89, <a href=\"http://www.zoete-broodjes.nl\">zoete-broodjes.nl</a>) which organises regular exhibitions and projects.</p> <h2>Club 8 </h2> <p>Probably the biggest magnet for people from outside the district, this nightclub features an alternative and varied programe of DJs, live bands and video screenings, which flirt with the alternative side of things - from the boogie-tastic Disco Exota to the more snotty attitude of club night Fuck Yeah. Plush retro leather couches bring quality to the chill-out zone. The club is also worth a daytime trip for the massive pool hall downstairs.<br><strong>Admiraal de Ruyterweg 56B</strong>, (+20-685 1703, <a href=\"http://www.club-8.nl\">club-8.nl</a>).</p> <h2>Con-Fusion</h2> <p>At this hip restaurant you can choose between the lounge-style interior and the lovely canal-side terrace where you can slump in old-fashioned deck-chairs. Locals accuse Con-Fusion of naming itself after the service - but at least the staff are friendly when you finally have their attention. The Turkish bread sandwiches are super cheap but super filling. <br><strong>Postjesweg 7</strong>, (+20-616 2122, <a href=\"http://www.restaurantconfusion.nl\">restaurantconfusion.nl</a>).</p> <h2>Het Sieraad</h2> <p>Once a trade college for crafts people, mostly jewellers, and later squatted, De Sieraad was renovated and reopened last year to house a musical academy, smaller creative companies and artist studios.<br><strong>Postjesweg 1</strong>, (<a href=\"http://www.het-sieraad.nl\">het-sieraad.nl</a>).</p> <h2>Edel</h2> <p>Situated in Het Sieraad, caf\u00e9-restaurant Edel has a fantastic waterside terrace with picnic tables shaded by huge elm trees, and is best enjoyed at lunch with a sandwich or a salad. Dinner features French-Mediterranean cooking such as rack of lamb with polenta fries. From 11pm on Thursdays through Saturdays, DJs play music to match its loungey interior.<br><strong>Postjesweg 1</strong>, (+20-799 5000, <a href=\"http://www.edelamsterdam.nl\">edelamsterdam.nl</a>).</p> <h2>Meneer de Wit</h2> <p>Across from Het Sieraad, Meneer de Wit is both a gallery and a studio space for artists and creative companies, including the much acclaimed handbag design collective Hardtroze (hardtroze .nl). Its managers are also active in organising community art projects, such as creating a white line (dewittelijn.nl) that dissected the neighbourhood, running up walls, over buildings, through backyards and across canals. Earlier this summer they helped organised a graffiti event (mikosa.net) involving local youngsters and international names including the Boghe, Morcky, Zedz and the London Police.<br><strong>Postjesweg 2, </strong>(<a href=\"http://www.meneerdewit.com\">meneerdewit.com</a>).</p>",
  "<p>The headquarters of the Equality and Human Rights Commission are so shiny and new they feel box fresh, like a pair of unworn shoes. Its chief executive is immaculately coiffed, and as we shake hands I feel embarrassed of my scruffy jeans. Nicola Brewer is almost corporately suave - glamorous, vigorous - and her gleaming glass corner office, gazing out towards the Thames, suggests a triumphant metaphor for shattered glass ceilings. It all feels a long way from the 1970s feminist activism of the old Equal Opportunities Commission. </p> <p>But not, however, quite as far as Brewer might have hoped. This week the EHRC published the fifth annual Sex and Power report, a responsibility it inherited from the EOC, and the news is not good. The report audits a range of influential posts, from politicians to newspaper editors to business leaders. In 12 of the 25 categories of power and influence measured, women's representation has actually fallen. In five it has remained roughly unchanged, and in only eight has there been any improvement. </p> <p>A \"loss of momentum\" is how Brewer chooses to describe the findings. \"There is,\" she points out straight away, \"some good news in the report. That classic phrase, critical mass - which is about a third - has been achieved in the Welsh assembly, in the Scottish parliament we're there too. So there is some good news.\" She cites the Olympic triumph of swimmer Rebecca Adlington as a recent boost - \"I think everybody felt fabulous about that\" - and describes Val Gooding, chief executive of Bupa, as a \"truly inspirational\" figure. Patricia Amos, Eliza Manningham-Buller, Jane Campbell and Valerie Amos are all named as part of a strengthened female contingent in the House of Lords. </p> <p>But despite a predisposition towards finding reasons to be cheerful, Brewer admits that at this rate a snail could crawl from Land's End to John O'Groats and back before equal numbers of women reach the top of FTSE 100 companies. Why does she think, almost a quarter of a century after the Sex Discrimination Act, we're still so far from realising its ambition? \"There's still a bit of what you'd call classic discrimination,\" she acknowledges. But the much bigger issue, she argues, is not sexism - or even gender at all. \"It's to do with old-fashioned, inflexible ways of working.\"</p> <p>Given Brewer's job, one might think, well, she would say that, wouldn't she? Last autumn the EHRC absorbed not just the EOC, but also the Commission for Racial Equality and the Disability Rights Commission into one equality superquango. Its very existence is premised on a belief that the interests of different minority groups are neither unique nor exclusive. But Brewer appears genuinely, passionately, convinced that the problem is not gender-specific. </p> <p>\"The old-fashioned and rigid ways of working don't just work against the interests of women. We have more over-60s than under-16s. Older workers would like not to have a sharp cliff at retirement. So older workers, emphatically, are affected. Also people who've been out of the workplace, and want to return. And people who have caring responsibilities. And people with disabilities.\"</p> <p>She refers to her sister, a nurse, who left the workforce to have a family and subsequently had to retrain. \"A lot of businesses today operate 24/7, essentially. No human being, man woman, disabled not disabled, can function 24 hours a day. So they are having to look at different ways of working. We know from the polling evidence that lots of people, not just women, want to work flexibly. They want a work-life balance. If you're a manager with a team of 20, and they all want to work flexibly, and they all want the same kind of pattern - not after 3pm or in school holidays - then that's really hard to manage. But if someone says actually I like to come in really early, and someone else wants to work Wednesdays - well paradoxically, it's easier for a manager to fit that together.\"</p> <p>Brewer clearly wants business to see her as sympathetic and is keen to offer praise. \"All the evidence indicates that small businesses are quite flexible. They just don't call it flexible working.\" The phrase, she observes, \"has become pejorative, because it's what women want\". But she is happy to overlook the chauvinism of the semantics, \"because the point is, the reality of flexible working is fine\". </p> <p>Pragmatic cooperation is clearly the new watchword of Brewer's EHRC. But has she seen any evidence that employers are getting the message? \"I think there was a sense built up that some businesses - not all - were quite wary,\" she says delicately. \"One of the things we've tried to do is signal early on that we want to talk to business about what works for them and what works for people. The legislative environment is really complex. We're trying to say that we know it's complex, and we're trying to help.\" </p> <p>Do they believe her? She smiles. \"We're only 10 and a half months old. My guess is they haven't made their mind up yet.\"</p> <p>More combative feminists might look at the Sex and Power report and conclude that the way to make employers treat women equally is by compulsion, not charm. \"Sometimes,\" Brewer agrees, \"we're asked should we have quotas. But we're absolutely not saying that.\" But if the strategy of gentle persuasion isn't working, why not? \"Because I think that for women and other underrepresented groups, they want to feel that they've got where they are on merit. They don't want to feel they've got a job because they are the token person who makes up the quota. I think you've got to look at talent, you've got to look at merit. That's always been my view.\"</p> <p>Brewer's own career could be seen as a testament to the power of individual merit. She joined the Foreign Office in 1983 - only 11 years after women were expected to resign on marriage - and was posted all over the world along with her diplomat husband. After the birth of their second child in 1994 she persuaded the FCO to create its first flexible job-share in such a senior position - head of personnel policy - from which she advanced to head of European policy. </p> <p>She thinks the way she has organised her own life is an example of how to approach the whole issue of flexible working. \"One size doesn't fit all - to make it work it's got to work for the individual, the employer, and their colleagues. And what works at one time may not work at another.\" She and her husband, Geoffrey Gillham, have shared the responsibility for caring for their two children, now teenagers. \"There were times when I took nearly a year off in maternity leave, and he worked full-time. There were times when I worked part-time and he worked full-time, and there were times when we both worked full-time.\" Gilham recently left the FCO and at the moment it is Brewer who is the full-time earner. \"And there's been a lot of juggling, texts and phonecalls we've exchanged saying: 'I can't get home for seven o'clock bath time, can you do it?'\"</p> <p>On first impressions Brewer can seem too conciliatory for the role of campaigning reformer. She cites Millicent Fawcett, rather than the Pankhursts, as a historical role model, noting approvingly that \"rather than chaining yourself to railings, Fawcett took a more measured approach\". But you begin to see that beneath the smiles, she is robust - even radical. Subtle arguments are always the hardest to make, as Brewer saw for herself this summer, when she questioned the wisdom of extending maternity rights, and warned that employers were becoming wary of hiring women. It was, as she says, a \"counterintuitive\" argument from the head of the EHRC - interpreted by some as saying if unscrupulous employers discriminate against women, we should ditch maternity rights. </p> <p>\"No, absolutely, emphatically, that was not what I was saying. Nor did I not say - though perhaps it didn't come across loudly and clearly enough - that progress we have made in maternity leave is a good thing. But the commission was thinking, hang on, we're starting to think it might have had some unintended consequences, let's look at those.\" The extension of maternity rights, she explains, imposes a presumption of parental responsibility on the mother alone, which feminists have been fighting for decades.</p> <p>This may sound like a crass question, I say, but do you call yourself a feminist? \"It doesn't sound like a crass question,\" she smiles back. \"Yeah, I do. What do I mean by that? I just assume that women are just as capable as men. That's what I've always assumed. Why do you think it's a crass question?\"</p> <p>It would have been a ludicrous thing to ask her predecessors at the EOC, I agree. But in the brave new pragmatic, non-adversarial, postmodern world of the EHRC, one can't take anything for granted. </p> <p>\"Yes,\" she repeats, is her answer. \"And I usually add, of course.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>Monday</strong><br>Toryboy wants to move the fridge. Apparently it is too far from the counter tops. There is a pause while I gather my thoughts.</p> <p>\"Are you saying that you find the five steps between them too onerous a trek when making the thrice-daily pots of tea that constitute your entire interest in and use of the kitchen and its appliances?\"</p> <p>\"No. I am simply ever vigilant when it comes to identifying ways of improving domestic efficiencies.\"</p> <p>\"Where, as a matter of purely academic interest, would you put the fridge?\"</p> <p>\"Here,\" he says, gesturing.</p> <p>\"Here?\" I say, because although my incredulity glands have hugely increased in size, thanks to the enormous demands placed on them over the past four, long and suddenly, in retrospect, even more painful years, I am still struggling to believe this. \"Right here?\"</p> <p>\"Yes.\"</p> <p>\"But then it would block half the window.\"</p> <p>\"I know.

  "<p>Opec, the producers' cartel, includes 13 nations, but there are essentially three leading figures who dictate the direction of oil prices:</p> <p><strong>Ali al-Naimi</strong><br><strong>Minister of petroleum and mineral resources in Saudi Arabia</strong></p> <p>A former shepherd, this modest man also keeps his comments in front of the media short, earning himself the sobriquet The Silent Saudi. He is aware that any slip of the tongue could add or subtract billions of dollars in investments on the oil markets.</p> <p>But behind the scenes, the Saudi technocrat is expansive, keen to use his enormous knowledge and expertise to guide members of Opec or other groups to sensible and relatively conservative solutions. Saudi Arabia might have the strength of being the biggest oil producer, but it takes skills to negotiate a position that will help the west when dealing with Opec members that include Venezuela and Iran. He has often supported an increase in oil supply to placate important friends in the west. </p> <p>Saudi Arabia is currently pumping flat out, adding 200,000 barrels of oil a day in June with a view to increasing capacity to 12.5m a day by the end of next year. Hugo Navarro, a specialist on international oil markets at consultants Capital Economics, said: \"Opec's most powerful member, Saudi Arabia, is sensitive to western public opinion and will not want to be seen putting renewed upward pressure on oil prices at a time when global economic growth is slowing.\"</p> <p><strong>Gholam Hossein Nozari</strong><br><strong>Iran's minister of petroleum</strong></p> <p>Iran is the most hawkish member of Opec. It often calls for production cuts when other countries are more reluctant. Nozari recently said pumping more oil would do nothing to stop the surge in prices, after Saudi Arabia revealed that it may be increasing its production again. \"Increased oil production does not have such an impact that it would decrease prices, because enough oil exists in the global market,\" he said. \"Just compare 300,000 barrels per day with about 86m, which the markets need. What would be the effect?\"</p> <p><strong>Rafael Ramirez</strong><br><strong>Venezuela's oil minister</strong></p> <p>Venezuela is another hawkish member that often demands cuts in production to boost the price. Ramirez believes that Opec does not need to increase its supply. \"We don't see a need to increase oil production ... The market is well supplied,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Is it over? Was that the oil shock? Can we relax, sit back and expect our energy bills and prices at the pumps to tumble? It is true that the price of oil is down. In early July, the price peaked at $147 a barrel. Yesterday it hit $106. A fall of almost 30% in two months suggests the old rule that \"nothing cures high prices like high prices\" may finally be working in the oil market.</p> <p>Americans used less in their cars over the summer: demand in the US fell by 800,000 barrels a day in the first half of this year, the largest decline for 26 years. In the UK, Ryanair is grounding more planes this winter. The global economy is slowing - even China, the biggest source of new demand, may soon be feeling colder breezes. But what's this? Leading members of Opec, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, want to reduce oil supplies to keep the price high.</p> <p>The 13 members of the cartel meet in Vienna next week and Iran and Venezuela have made their position clear. \"Oil supply must be well proportioned with demand, and control over Opec's excess oil supply is an issue that must be discussed,\" said Gholam Hossein Nozari, Iran's oil minister, this week. Translation: he doesn't want to see the price fall below $100.</p> <p>To many in the west, the stance will seem outrageous. Gordon Brown was furious with Opec in May, when the price was $135 a barrel. \"It is, as people will recognise, a scandal that 40% of the oil is controlled by Opec, that their decisions can restrict the supply of oil to the rest of the world, and that at a time when oil is desperately needed and supply needs to expand that Opec can withhold supply from the market,\" he said.</p> <p>Brown sounded like a buttoned-up version of the property tycoon Donald Trump, whose regular rants against Opec have entertained viewers of US financial television channels in the past year. </p> <p>\"It is an illegal monopoly,\" he told CNBC a few months ago. \"If businesses ever formed Opec, everybody would be put in jail. Every time a country hits oil, they are invited into the cartel. It's a disgrace.\"</p> <p>A decade ago, the west's view of Opec was different. The organisation, having enjoyed its heyday in the 1970s, was regarded as a spent force. Its summits in hotels in Vienna and Geneva were dismissed as squabbles over who had been cheating on quotas by over-producing - usually Venezuela or Nigeria. After 25 years of trying to control the oil market, Opec seemed doomed - damned by internal indiscipline and the success of the west in finding alternative supplies of oil.</p> <p>Its nadir was 1998, when Opec was persuaded to increase production quotas. The timing was awful. The Asian currency crisis slowed the region's Tiger economies and the price of oil fell to close to $10 a barrel. The following year, the Economist magazine famously predicted the price could be heading to $5. The world was \"drowning in oil\". Opec seemed irrelevant and powerless.</p> <p><strong>Boomtime</strong></p> <p>Then the boom started. The 1990s were revealed as a decade of under-investment, not only by Opec but by non-Opec producers, including the big oil companies. New fields hadn't been discovered. Refining capacity hadn't been built. Shell had over-stated its reserves. Existing oil fields were depleting faster than expected, especially in Mexico and the North Sea. China and India began to industrialise and to subsidise oil for their own citizens. Demand was accelerating and supply was struggling to keep up.</p> <p>The ability of the US to bully Saudi Arabia, Opec's most important member, into increasing production quickly came under question. The Saudis guard closely their data on the oil reserves and production capability. Why? \"Peak oil\" theorists argue it's because the big reserves aren't as big as advertised. </p> <p>Even President George Bush seemed to endorse the thought in January this year. \"If they don't have a lot of additional oil to put on the market, it is hard to ask somebody to do something they may not be able to do,\" he said.</p> <p>In the autumn of 2006, with the price having fallen from $75 to $60 a barrel, Opec demonstrated it was willing to use its newly restored influence over prices. It briefly reduced its production quotas, a signal that it was prepared to defend a price of $60 a barrel. With barely a blip along the way, the price climbed to that record of $147 this July.</p> <p>Was that Opec alone? Was it the combination of growth in China and India and the western oil companies' inability to increase production? Was it the weakness of the dollar, creating an incentive for producers to leave their appreciating asset in the ground rather than turn it into a depreciating currency? Was it a classic investment bubble, fuelled by the growth of financial speculation in the futures market? Probably some or all of the above. Either way, the approach of $100 is a critical test of Opec's current mood and power.</p> <p>In the old days, the Saudis were the voice of restraint. After the oil shock of the 1970s, the Saudi oil minister Ahmed Yamani urged fellow members to be cautious, arguing that high prices would lead to a reduction in demand and cause the west to become more fuel-efficient. Yet the Saudi ruling families have a huge social welfare programme to fund - as a rough guess, say some analysts, a price of $70, if sustained for a long period, would now create political tension. </p> <p>Add $20 or so for the economies of Iran and Venezuela, also built on the single commodity of oil.</p> <p>\"Could the price go below $100, to $90 or even $80?,\" asks Mike Wagstaff, chief executive of Venture Production, a North Sea oil and gas producer. \"Well, yes, it could but I can't see it going much lower than that. Opec has shown itself to be a much more disciplined organisation over the past seven or eight years.\"</p> <p>He also argues that \"the reality is that the west can't afford the price to go much below $100 because people need to fund investment.\" His point is that the industry's costs have risen as oil has become harder to find and to produce. A deep-water rig used for drilling in the deep waters off Brazil or west Africa costs $600,000 to $700,000 a day to hire; three or four years ago, the price was $200,000 to $350,000. Analysts at the investment bank Goldman Sachs calculate that the marginal cost of production, a critical figure for all commodities, now lies between $80 and $90 a barrel.</p> <p>Hugo Navarro of Capital Economics expects to see a classic fudge from Opec next week. He thinks official quotas will be left unchanged but actual production will be quietly cut in the coming months.</p> <p>He argues that Saudi Arabia is sensitive to western public opinion and doesn't want to be seen to be putting pressure on prices at a time when global growth is slowing. \"Even at current price levels, the cartel will still reap massive profit, given that Opec members have amongst the lowest production costs in the world,\" says Navarro.</p> <p>At the same, he says, the cartel has good reason to try to reduce output: \"The last time Opec significantly increased production to stave off a global economic slowdown in the late 1990s, the results were a disaster for the cartel.\" Even so, he thinks, attempts to support a price floor of $100 will be unsuccessful - Capital Economics sees prices fall to $90 in a year.</p> <p><strong>Bullish</strong></p> <p>Most other forecasters are more bullish, but even Goldman Sachs, which coined the phrase \"super spike\" more than three years ago, said yesterday oil was \"nearing a critical inflection point\". It still expects $130 a barrel for the fourth quarter of this year, and $140 in 2009, but attaches a big qualification: \"In the event that a global recession and hard landing in China does materialise, spot crude oil prices would likely fall well below $100 per barrel.\"</p> <p>For consumers in the west, it's hard to find a reason to be cheerful in that forecast - expect either high energy prices or global recession. The shock isn't over.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's plumbers are being offered something a little different from the average suburban callout or wonky flushing lever - a post with the British Antarctic Survey protecting pipes in temperatures of -20C.</p> <p>The job on Bird island, which lies in treacherous seas off the western tip of South Georgia, is being advertised as suitable for someone with a fondness for seabirds and scenery, as well as general maintenance skills.</p> <p>Competent plumbing has been key to Antarctic success since the days of Scott and Shackleton, when leaks in huts or boats could be a matter of life and death. The personnel officer of the BAS, James Miller, said yesterday: \"This is an amazing opportunity. Where else can you work in an environment surrounded by penguins, seals and icebergs?\" The successful applicant will join 10 scientists for the Arctic summer which starts shortly. The 18-month contract extends into the continent's winter and summer next year. </p> <p>Bird island has grown to form a complex of modern cabins, built in 2005, from primitive huts established by Captain Cook, who discovered the island in 1775. </p> <p>Miller said: \"It's a really fun place to work and by supporting the scientists who look into important issues like climate change you'll feel like you're doing something really worthwhile.\"</p> <p>Applicants cannot take dependants and there is no TV, but internet links are open 24 hours. The salary is relatively modest by British plumbing standards at \u00a322,340. But as the BAS says: \"There isn't really anything at Bird island to spend it on.\"</p>",
  "<p>No sport is entirely bullet-proof in the face of a global economic slowdown but rugby union is proving splendidly resilient. Just over 50,000 spectators are expected to slosh through the puddles to attend today's double-header at Twickenham, the latest illustration of the club game's soaring marketability. If the players can keep pace with the public appetite, the 2008-09 Guinness Premiership season will be as striking as any of its predecessors.</p> <p>It has reached the point, according to the Harlequins chief executive, Mark Evans, where barely any of the top Tri-Nations players will be able to resist boarding the gravy train. \"I think it'll be a rare southern hemisphere player over the next 10 years who doesn't play part of his career in the north,\" said Evans after unveiling plans for Quins to face Leicester in another 50,000-capacity Twickenham extravaganza on December 27. He did not need to add that the majority are either already here or frantically ringing their agents.</p> <p>Nor does Evans believe the bubble will burst in the foreseeable future. Even London Scottish, having clawed their way back to the equivalent of English rugby's third division, have just secured a half-million pound sponsorship deal with a Saudi investment firm. There have also been rumours of South African-backed investment in a middle-ranking National One club. Toulon are the new moneybags of France and Perpignan won the race to sign the All Black fly-half Dan Carter with a package reputedly worth about \u00a3600,000 for 20 games. </p> <p>\"A lot of the English clubs' financial models still don't work and some are still losing a lot of money,\" cautioned Evans. \"Professional rugby has never traded through a recession and it's going to be interesting to see how we do. But three English clubs are quite profitable and a number are there or thereabouts. If you look across Europe at the strength of the Irish provinces and the game in France you've got to make a step change. There's no doubt in my mind the boom in France will be sustained because football is so much smaller in their market.\"</p> <p>Certain exceptions do exist on this side of the Channel. Bristol are operating this season on a budget of about \u00a31m less than the salary cap of \u00a34m while Bath are still hamstrung by their continued failure to agree a deal to redevelop the Recreation Ground. But in the north and south of the country, the professional game has mushroomed from a few hundred bedraggled souls clutching pints on the touchline to five-figure average gates and more. </p> <p>\"There's no other sport in the country in the last 100 years that has built crowds like rugby union but it's still tough,\" Evans said. \"It's a long-term business. You can get them for a one-off game but persuading them to come every week is a different thing entirely.\" </p> <p>The other cautionary note relates to the structure of the coming year, as jam-packed as ever. If Wasps finish in the top four it will be an outstanding achievement as they will be releasing a minimum of 14 players to English senior or Saxons duty for chunks of the season under the new eight-year deal between the Rugby Football Union and the clubs. Without a decent start the champions could struggle to pull off their usual late power surge and Leicester will also need the early-season feelgood factor under Heyneke Meyer to translate into immediate points.</p> <p>Quins have made two astute signings in the All Black fly-half Nick Evans and the Argentinian centre Gonzalo Tiesi. Gloucester will be strong again but Sale's signing of the Wales scrum-half Dwayne Peel may just prove the best piece of business of all. Underfoot conditions permitting, the likelihood must be that games will be conducted at a quicker pace under the experimental law variations and Peel's speed of thought and eye for a gap should allow Charlie Hodgson to unleash an exceptionally talented back division. Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9 has the look of a man who will not tolerate another season of underachievement.</p> <p>Little mention here so far of Bristol or Newcastle, and that tells its own story. Richard Hill and Steve Bates are both good coaches and admirable rugby men but one of them looks set to endure a difficult winter. As for the top of the table, Gloucester, Sale, Leicester and Harlequins perhaps look best bets to make the end-of-season play-offs, with Wasps, Bath and Worcester also jostling for Europe. Credit crunch or not, a richly rewarding campaign awaits.</p> <h2>How the bookies see it</h2> <p><strong>Odds to finish top</strong></p> <p>Gloucester 3-1</p> <p>Leicester 3-1</p> <p>Wasps 7-2</p> <p>Bath 8-1</p> <p>Saracens 8-1</p> <p>Sale 9-1</p> <p>Harlequins 16-1</p> <p>London Irish 20-1</p> <p>Northampton 50-1</p> <p>Worcester 100-1</p> <p>Bristol 100-1</p> <p>Newcastle 125-1</p> <p><strong>Leading tryscorer</strong></p> <p>T Varndell 7-1</p> <p>L Vainikolo 8-1</p> <p>M Banahan 9-1</p> <p>J Simpson-Daniel 10-1</p> <p>C Ashton 12-1</p> <p>A Tuilagi 12-1</p>",
  "<p>The reader will be relieved to learn that in three of the stories in Fine Just the Way It Is, Annie Proulx's third collection of Wyoming tales, American naturalism is alive and well. The doctrine of free will is here flung down and danced upon. Characters born into a deterministic universe wherein daily life is physically and socially brutal make doomed attempts to flourish, but are cut down and ground to dust. They are granted glimpses of happiness, usually in the summer, but these are shortlived (as are the characters) and only increase the bitterness of their fate.</p> <p>\"Them Old Cowboy Songs\", the saddest of these stories, relates the history of Archie and Rose McLaverty, a 16-year-old orphan and his 14-year-old wife who, in 1885, stake out a homestead \"where the Little Weed comes rattling down from the Sierra Madre, water named not for miniature and obnoxious flora, but for PH Weed, a gold seeker who had starved near its source\". There's doom in that there creek name, and it comes rattling down on Rose and Archie, but first they have a blissful summer. They pass their evenings in lovemaking, \"their bed spread on the floor among the chips and splinters in the half-finished cabin\". One night, Rose, \"in some kind of transport\", turns her kisses to \"sharp nips\". When she feels her young husband shaking, she looks up to see \"his eyes closed, tears in his lashes, face contorted in a grimace:</p> <p>\"'Oh Archie, I didn't mean to hurt, Archie - '</p> <p>\"'You did not,' he groaned. 'It's. I ain't never been. Loved. I just can't hardly stand it - ' and he began to blubber 'feel like I been shot', pulling her into his arms, rolling half over so that the salty tears and his saliva wet her embroidered waist shirt, calling her his little birdeen, and at that moment she would have walked into a furnace for him.\"</p> <p>The strongest - and in some ways the strangest - story in the collection is called \"The Great Divide\". It too follows a young couple, Hi and Helen Alcorn, who set out to make a new life in a difficult environment. Hi Alcorn, a good-natured, optimistic sort, who has come through the Great War with only a slight limp and a deep contempt for the \"Frenchies\", watches his enterprises fail, one after the other, until he is forced to choose between working with his brother-in-law, Fenk Fipps - a brute who beats his wife and abuses the horses he rounds up for a living - and becoming a coalminer. It's a mythic choice. Hi loves the light and freedom of the plains, but he can't bear to witness Fenk's cruelty, so he opts to go down into the darkness.</p> <p>What sets this story apart from the others is a thematic density that reverberates in the reader's imagination long after the last line is over, a sense of the author's profound engagement with every ramification of the word \"divide\". It's not the longest story in the collection, but for my money, it's the deepest.</p> <p>\"Tits-Up in a Ditch\", a hilarious title for a grim tale, concerns the undoing of Dakotah Lister, whose 15-year-old mother, Shaina, disappeared the day after Dakotah was born, \"slinking and wincing, still in her hospital johnny, down the back stairs of Mercy Maternity to the street, where one of her greasy pals picked her up and headed west for Los Angeles\". From this unpromising beginning, Dakotah's life runs steadily downhill, through an early, unhappy marriage, the birth of a son, a stint in an army training camp in Missouri, and brief happiness in a friendship with a female soldier. They make their final trip together in a Humvee, \"Dakotah clutching a machine gun, on their way to a checkpoint to search Iraqi women\". It's a harrowing and riveting journey.</p> <p>Of the other stories, two are tall tales, concerning a homicidal sagebrush and a bloodthirsty stone bowl. There's a predictable cautionary tale about a young woman who gets into a snit and goes for a hike without her cellphone, and the longish saga of Ray Forkenbrock, who discovers at his father's funeral that the old man had several families.</p> <p>Two of the stories don't take place in Wyoming at all, but in hell, so one is justified in asking what in hell they are doing here. In one the devil is hot to redecorate the inferno, and in the other he intercepts an email in which a frustrated ornithologist complains, \"I'd sell my soul for a pterodactyl\". Scenting a Faustian pact, His Satanic Majesty sets out to close the deal. These are hardly stories at all, just running gags, not funny, but mercifully brief, and, like their protagonist, irredeemably bad.</p> <p>So there's a lot of range here, too varied for my taste, but then I've never lived out west. But the three excellent long stories that make up half the volume are well worth the price of entry, and if you enjoy a well-told tall tale, that runs it up to five out of nine - not a bad return for the gambling reader. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Valerie Martin's novels include Property (Abacus).</p>",
  "<p>Abu Dhabi's royal family paid a lot of money for Manchester City but it expects to get a lot back in return, mostly in ways that cannot be measured in mere cash.</p> <p>The \u00a3210m investment is supposed to buy a top finish in the Premiership and then the Champions League, where the real money is made. It could also buy a seat at the top table in the new world of diplomacy - where, pound for pound, the soft power of football can outpunch gunboats or armies.</p> <p>The new emissaries, the players, can achieve things diplomats can only dream of - flying the flag and winning recognition, even adoration, from millions of foreigners. Nothing could be more conducive to clinching trade and investment deals.</p> <p>Ten times more people watch Premier League football on television in China than in Britain, and in the remotest villages where the locals speak hardly a word of English, they usually know how to say Manchester United. The emirs of Abu Dhabi hope they will be able to manage the word City.</p> <p>On planet football the US is no more than a developing country. England is the true superpower. The Premier League is the richest and best loved of all the world's football leagues, a global super-brand. The big money and the best players may be foreign, but they play on English soil in front of mostly English crowds. Gordon Brown has tried to press this advantage. He calls it \"England's secret diplomatic weapon\" and his forays abroad have often been wrapped in football paraphernalia. When he visited Shanghai as chancellor three years ago he latched on to the fact that the city was twinned with Liverpool and took with him Liverpool and Everton kits.</p> <p>Britain is not alone in using football as diplomatic currency. Armenia's president, Serge Sarkisian, has invited his Turkish counterpart, Abdullah Gul, to a 2010 World Cup qualifier today to break the ice between the two countries.</p> <p>Australia's decision to switch from the Oceania World Cup qualifying group to the Asian Football Confederation was taken largely to raise the country's image in the emerging economies of the east.</p> <p>Individuals can play the game as well. Roman Abramovich bought Chelsea not only as an expensive plaything. The purchase also stitched him into the fabric of British (and global) sporting life to the extent that it could make him untouchable if the tides turn against him in Moscow.</p> <p>For the princes of Abu Dhabi, the advantages are both personal and diplomatic. According to Mamoun Fandy, of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, it is about keeping up with Dubai, Abu Dhabi's greatest rival among the seven statelets of the United Arab Emirates.</p> <p>\"There is a general feeling in the Emirates that Dubai has become the brand name for the country, while Abu Dhabi - though the capital and largest emirate - is receding in the background. The whole plan is putting Abu Dhabi back on the map,\" Fandy said.</p>",
  "<p>In the combination of New Orleans and hurricanes, we have the most powerful argument possible for the necessity of \"change\". It's all there: gaping inequality, deep racism, crumbling public infrastructure, global warming, rampant corruption, the Blackwater-isation of the public sector. And none of it is in the past tense. In New Orleans whole neighbourhoods have gone to seed, Charity hospital remains shuttered, public housing has been deliberately destroyed - and the levee system is still far from repaired.</p> <p>Gustav should have been political rat poison for the Republicans, no matter how well it was managed. Yet, as Peter Baker noted in the New York Times, \"rather than run away from the hurricane and its political risks, Mr McCain ran toward it\". If this strategy worked, it was at least partly because Barack Obama has been running away from New Orleans for his entire campaign.</p> <p>Unlike John Edwards, who started and ended his nomination bid surrounded by the decay of New Orleans's Ninth Ward, Obama has shied away from the powerful symbolism the city offers. He waited almost a year after Hurricane Katrina to visit New Orleans and spent just half a day there ahead of the Louisiana primary. During the Democratic convention, Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden made no mention of New Orleans in their keynotes. Bill Clinton spared just a few words: \"Katrina and cronyism.\"</p> <p>In his Denver speech, Obama did invoke a government \"that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes\". But that only scratches the surface of what happened to New Orleans's poorest residents, who were first forcibly relocated and then forced to watch from afar as their homes, schools and hospitals were stolen. As Obama spoke in Denver, families in New Orleans were already packing their bags in anticipation of Gustav, steeling themselves for yet another evacuation. They heard not even a perfunctory \"our thoughts and prayers are with you\" from the Democratic candidate for president.</p> <p>There are plenty of political reasons for this, of course. Obama's campaign is pitching itself to the middle class, not the class of discarded people New Orleans represents. The problem is that by remaining virtually silent about the most dramatic domestic outrage in modern US history, Obama created a political vacuum. When Gustav hit, all McCain needed to do to fill it was show up. Sure, it was cynical for McCain to claim the hurricane zone as a campaign backdrop; but it was Obama who left that potent terrain vacant.</p> <p>Until now, Obama's supporters have largely accepted the campaign's assessment of the compromises necessary to win, offering only gentle prodding. The fact that the Republicans have turned New Orleans to their advantage should put an end to this blind obedience. </p> <p>Republicans have a better attitude towards their candidate. When they don't like McCain's positions, they change them. Take the hottest-button issue of the campaign: offshore oil drilling. Just four months ago, it was not even on the radar. During the Republican primary, the issue barely came up, and when it did, McCain did not support it. None of this bothered former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and his newly minted American Solutions for Winning the Future. Gingrich waited patiently for what his party loves most: a crisis. It arrived in May, when oil approached $130 a barrel. First came a petition to lower petrol prices by opening up domestic drilling (nonsense). Next was a poll, packed with laughably leading questions: \"Some people have suggested that, to combat the rising cost of energy and reduce dependence on foreign energy sources, the United States should use more of its own domestic energy reserves, including the oil and coal it already has here in the US. Do you support or oppose this idea?\" You can guess what people said. Two weeks later, McCain flipped on offshore oil drilling.</p> <p>There was always a risk attached to making offshore drilling the centrepiece of the McCain campaign, since it is not nearly as safe as its advocates claim. Environmentalists have been trying to point this out, but nothing makes the case quite as forcefully as a category five hurricane rocking oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, forcing evacuations and raising the spectre of a serious spill.</p> <p>Gustav was one of those rare moments when political arguments are made by reality, not rhetoric. It was the time to simply point and say: \"This is why we oppose more drilling.\" It was also the time to recall that during hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the official Minerals Management Service report found more than 100 accidents leading to a total of 743,400 gallons of oil spilled throughout the region. To put that in perspective, 100,000 gallons is classified as a \"major spill\". If one is feeling particularly bold, a category five hurricane is also an opportune time to mention that scientists see a link between heavier storms and warming ocean temperatures - warmed in part by the fossil fuels being extracted from those fallible platforms.</p> <p>Obama was not able to make these kinds of arguments when Gustav hit. That's because his campaign had made another \"strategic\" decision: to compromise on offshore oil drilling. Again a vacuum that had been opened up was rapidly filled by the Republicans, who instantly (and absurdly) linked the hurricane to the need for \"energy security\". The morning after Gustav made landfall, Bush called for more drilling. Earlier, McCain had visited the hurricane zone with his new running mate, Sarah Palin, whose sole prior claim to national fame was telling cable shows that \"we need to drill, drill, drill\".</p> <p>In moments of crisis, it is possible to speak hard truths with great force and clarity. But when the truth has gone silent, lies, boldly told, will work almost as well.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>This column was first published in <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com\">The Nation</a> </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong><a href=\"http://www.naomiklein.org\">naomiklein.org</a></p>",
  "<p>In June, on the little-celebrated anniversary of Gordon Brown's premiership, a senior Downing Street figure unwisely briefed the Times that the prime minister was \"preparing to deliver an economic plan in the autumn on which he is ready to stake his survival and lingering prospects for a fourth Labour term\". </p> <p>That plan, to be revealed in September, would be a frank assessment of the state of the British economy, and would set out specific measures to help those struggling with booming commodity prices. </p> <p>The briefing slowly acquired the status of fact, fatally raising expectations that the prime minister had a plan that would lift his party out of the doldrums, and protect hard-pressed voters from the ravages of the world's first global financial crisis. </p> <p>This week the first part of Brown's plan was unveiled - and it was a relatively modest affair. </p> <p>It was launched against the inauspicious backdrop of differences between the Treasury and No 10 over the health of the economy, persistent reports that Brown's chief strategic adviser Stephen Carter, appointed only six months ago, had lost the confidence of the prime minister, and suggestions, confirmed by No 10 by the end of the week, that Brown had been forced to abandon plans to hand out one-off payments, funded by energy companies' excess profits, to help the poor pay fuel bills this winter. To make matters worse, proposals to boost the housing market, unveiled on Tuesday by the prime minister in the kitchen of a flat in Ealing, west London, were greeted with a lacklustre response from the housing industry and estate agents. </p> <p>The relaunch coincided with sterling sliding again and grim statistics documenting draining confidence in the consumer and housing markets.</p> <p>One senior shadow cabinet member crowed yesterday: \"It has not gone well for him, especially since he has had about two or three months to get this ready. If it had gone well it would really have given him a platform to take him into his party conference speech, but now the pressure is on. He and his team have not managed expectations on this at all well.\"</p> <p>In probably the only good news for Downing Street, a potentially devastating assault on Brown's status as Labour leader by Charles Clarke, the former home secretary, blew itself out within 24 hours. In his attack Clarke himself confirmed that the cabinet is not yet ready to strike against Brown. The absence of other MPs willing to support Clarke in public suggests most Labour MPs do not yet see the removal of Brown as their way out of perdition.</p> <p>From the Labour backbenches, it still takes a leap of imagination to believe that a different leader could overcome the economic woes and make Labour popular again. </p> <p>\"It is simply not in the Labour DNA to get rid of our leaders,\" said one occasional conspirator, who also admitted that they cannot keep the prime minister on permanent probation.</p> <p>There is a further difficulty. The unions and the left are very wary of ditching Brown, fearing that David Miliband would succeed him and mark a return to what they see as Blairite politics. </p> <p>That does not mean Brown is safe until the next election. </p> <p>As one of the senior MPs who defended him in public this week admitted in private: \"The rebellion has gone off the boil over the summer, but that does not mean it cannot go back on. Things could yet crystallise at the [party] conference and maybe the weeks afterwards.\"</p> <p>The senior MP also conceded that the striking feature of this week was that the No 10 machine and Brown are still under-performing, and the media are still refusing to give the prime minister a hearing, a point made forcibly on BBC Newsnight by Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair's former director of communications, and now an occasional adviser to Brown. </p> <p>There is also deep concern in ministerial circles at reports of continued sniping inside No 10, and that chief strategy adviser Stephen Carter lacks an instinctive feel for Labour politics and is about to be demoted.</p> <p>Carter's job has been to organise the No 10 machine, and give advice to Brown. One of Carter's friends angrily denied stories that he had finally lost the confidence of the prime minister and was being shunted off into \"blue skies thinking\", or even the red benches of the House of Lords.</p> <p>Carter is also said to have lost the confidence of Jeremy Heywood, the highly-regarded permanent secretary in No 10, who is reported to have become frustrated at some of Carter's more abstract strategic analysis, once muttering: \"This is all very well, but what does this all mean in terms of policy?\"</p> <p>But friends of Carter insist he will stick it out, saying: \"He is far more effective and intelligent than the people in No 10 briefing against him. He is also a very resilient guy and is not going to be put off from doing an excellent job.</p> <p>\"The danger is that the schoolboy briefings could poison the atmosphere inside No 10 and make it difficult for people to work together. He started at a difficult time in February when the impact of the credit crunch had just started to hit Gordon's poll rating. People think he is a communications specialist like Campbell - that is not his role. He has achieved a lot and has a lot more to do, and it would be a catastrophe for Gordon if he was forced out. These kind of briefings are far more damaging than anything Clarke says on the record. It must make it harder for Downing Street to operate cohesively.\"</p> <p>In the short term Brown needs to ensure that the energy package he produces next week is as effective as possible, and wins over an increasingly agitated parliamentary party.</p> <p>Many mainstream Labour MPs would not go to the stake over whether there is a windfall tax per se, but do want to see a substantial contribution of extra cash by the electricity companies. </p> <p>They also want that cash to be used to provide some relief with the bills of poor gas and electricity users this winter. </p> <p>Commitments by the companies to raise extra cash for existing schemes, such as the carbon energy reduction target, to help with loft insulation or cavity walls, are good in the long-term. With the era of cheap energy over for good, it makes sense to take long-term measures to reduce electricity useage, and hence bills. </p> <p>But the political difficulty is that loft insulation can hardly be immediately installed in millions of homes in time to relieve the intense pressure on this winter's bills.</p> <p>By Wednesday Brown needs to find some money from somewhere to help with the immediate pressure on bills. If he does not he will face a rocky party conference, as Labour members make the treatment of the power firms a litmus test of the prime minister's willingness to challenge the market.</p> <p>It may seem a long time ago, but that briefing last June is now beginning to look extremely expensive for Brown and the Treasury.</p>",
  "<p>Share prices in London last night ended their grimmest week in more than six years after a sharp rise in unemployment in the United States fanned fresh fears about a deepening global economic downturn.</p> <p>With the City nervous about the outlook for Britain, news the jobless total in the world's biggest economy rose from 5.7% to 6.1% last month - its highest in five years - prompted the second successive three-figure decline in the FTSE 100 index. </p> <p>It followed Thursday's 139-point drop with a 121.4-point fall to close at 5240.7 last night, bringing the cumulative fall for the week to 396 points, or 7%.</p> <p>On Wall Street, hopes the 84,000 reduction in non-farm payrolls - the eighth fall in a row - could prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in coming months helped put a floor under shares. By noon in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was down about 50 points after a drop of some 300 points the previous day that sparked steep share price falls overnight in Tokyo and Hong Kong.</p> <p>Oil fell $1.50 a barrel to just under $106 last night in anticipation of weaker US demand as the economy slows this autumn, but the White House yesterday rejected the idea of a second package of tax cuts to boost the economy.</p> <p>US growth picked up in the second quarter as consumers spent the $150bn (\u00a384bn) in tax rebates sanctioned by George Bush, and the president's spokeswoman Dana Perino said yesterday the benefits were still being felt. \"The economic stimulus plan that we put in place is having the strong impact that we wanted it to have,\" she said. </p> <p>Responding to data from the US labour department showing unemployment at its highest since December 2003, Perino added: \"There's no question that the labour market is not as strong as we'd like and these were disappointing numbers. We want to see the economy return to job growth and we understand that this is a difficult time for many Americans.\" </p> <p>The jobs data brought a halt to sterling's recent drop against the dollar on foreign exchange markets. The pound rose more than a cent to $1.7660 and edged higher against the euro. Before the figures, the pound's trade-weighted index against a basket of currencies fell to a 12-year-low of 87.9, but later bounced to 88.4.</p> <p>\"Sterling's jump was down to the jobs figures, and to an adjustment of the extreme move we've seen this week,\" said Simon Derrick, head of currency research at the Bank of New York Mellon.</p> <p>A breakdown of the payroll figures showed construction shed 8,000 jobs last month, manufacturing 61,000, private services 44,000 and retail 20,000. The US's troubled motor industry bore the brunt of lay-offs in manufacturing, being responsible for 54,000 lost jobs - 39,000 in car plants and the rest in dealerships.</p> <p>Payroll figures for July were raised to 60,000 and June's to 100,000, from a previously reported 51,000 in each month. </p> <p>The figures were \"very ugly across the board\", said Boris Schlossberg at GFT Forex, New York. \"The most startling thing for the market was this huge jump in the unemployment rate. That's the highest number in five years. </p> <p>\"The jobless rate suggests ... we are probably going to have a much harder fourth quarter.\"</p>",
  "<h2>1969 Frank Kermode</h2> <p>The first judges were Rebecca West, Stephen Spender, David Farrer and WL Webb, at that time literary editor of the Guardian. We were handsomely treated: in London we haunted Bertorelli\u2019s, but we spent more than one weekend at Michael Astor\u2019s beautiful Cotswold house, where Dame Rebecca strode the grounds authoritatively between bouts of laying down the law. There were perhaps 60 books, which seemed a lot, though modern judges are said to read twice as many. Getting through the 60 was made easier by our not daring to take on Dame Rebecca. \u201cMiss Murdoch writes good and bad novels in alternate years,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a bad year.\u201d Muriel Spark: \u201cclever but too playful.\u201d And out they went. </p> <p>Two of us favoured Nicholas Mosley\u2019s Impossible Object, but were soon silenced. The choice of PH Newby\u2019s Something to Answer For was the result of a compromise. Dame Rebecca didn\u2019t dislike it as much as nearly all the others. Surveyors of the prize\u2019s history have spoken ill of this good book, perhaps without reading it, or by being too ready to suppose that this industrious writer could manage a novel a year as well as running the Third Programme. Anyway, I remember this, my one experience of judging, with much pleasure and amusement.</p> <h2>1970 Antonia Fraser</h2> <p>The judging of the 1970 prize was a low-key affair except for the feisty behaviour of Dame Rebecca West, a judge for the second year running. At one point she denounced Margaret Drabble for her novels of domestic life on the grounds that \u201cAnyone can do the washing-up; just get a big bowl and some liquid; so why complain about it?\u201d The novel in question was The Waterfall, which both Richard Hoggart and I admired greatly (and didn\u2019t think was about washing-up). I knew Rebecca West, since she was a friend and neighbour of my parents in Sussex, and was very fond of her; all the same, it occurred to me that she was possibly one of the brilliant old ladies who felt threatened by a brilliant young one in the shape of Maggie Drabble. In the end we were split between William Trevor\u2019s Mrs Eckdorf in O\u2019Neill\u2019s Hotel and Bernice Rubens\u2019s The Elected Member. I voted for Rubens but today would vote for Trevor. </p> <p>1971 was much more exacting. The most exciting thing that happened to me as a Booker Judge for the second time was not controversial. I shared a taxi back with fellow judge Saul Bellow on a long, long ride from somewhere in the City: he was nattily dressed in a pale green shantung suit, blue shirt, green tie with large blue dots on it; his silver hair and slanting, large dark eyes made him look like a 30s film star playing a refined gangster. Suddenly he leaned forward and asked: \u201cHas anyone ever told you that you\u2019re a very handsome woman?\u201d I pondered on a suitable reply, modest yet encouraging. But having spoken, the Great Man closed his eyes and remained apparently asleep for the rest of the journey.</p> <h2>1971 John Gross</h2> <p>A faint aroma of the Nobel prize - or of Nobel prizes yet to come - hangs over the 1971 Booker. First, the award went to VS Naipaul (who was to be Nobel laureate in 2001) for In a Free State. It was a result with which I agreed. Second, the organisers had succeeded in persuading a distinguished writer from abroad to be one of the judges: Saul Bellow (who was to be Nobel laureate in 1976). It seemed a thrilling prospect.</p> <p>In the event, one of the things I remember most clearly about Bellow is that he insisted on being put up at the Ritz (which must have burned a big hole in the budget), and then complained because he hadn\u2019t been given a room overlooking Green Park.</p> <p>Another recollection is his response when I advanced the claims of Elizabeth Taylor\u2019s Mrs Palfrey at the Claremont, which apart from the Naipaul was the book on the shortlist I most favoured. \u201cOh,\u201d he said, \u201cthat\u2019s one of those little tinkling teacup things that the British always do well.\u201d He was quite wrong - Mrs Palfrey is a work of deep feeling - but his dismissiveness effectively put paid to its chances.</p> <h2>1972 George Steiner</h2> <p>It was the most illustrious panel in the Booker\u2019s history. Both the other judges, Cyril Connolly and Elizabeth Bowen, were too ill to attend the ceremony. I fought very hard for John Berger to win for G, and then he threw it in my face by giving half the prize money to the Black Panthers. It was a very grim experience. I was in a very precarious position at the time and I literally thought it was the end for me in this country. I thought I would have to pack my bags and go. </p> <h2>1973 Edna O\u2019Brien</h2> <p>Mary McCarthy and I were the judges, with Karl Miller presiding as chairman. Disputes were negligible. From a batch of about 20, it was whittled down to two contenders - The Siege of Krishnapur by JG Farrell and The Black Prince by Iris Murdoch, with Farrell winning by a whisker. Next day, Mary changed her mind and it was left to Miller to cast the deciding vote, which he did with alacrity and no rancour. The prize has changed as the literary/publishing world has undergone a radical and not always edifying sea change: the celebrity virus now infects authors and judges alike.</p> <h2>1974 Ion Trewin</h2> <p>We were three judges - AS Byatt, Elizabeth Jane Howard and me. At the shortlist meeting, Jane remarked that she thought Ending Up by Kingsley Amis (then her husband) was his best book and should go on the shortlist. I looked first at Antonia, and then at Martyn Goff, the prize\u2019s administrator - both remained impassive. We broke for a breather. Martyn said that as chairman it was up to me. Antonia liked the novel (as did I). On literary grounds neither of us had problems about shortlisting it, but what would the press say? </p> <p>The Booker was already familiar with controversies. Martyn, I know, was not averse to the publicity that our decision would inevitably bring. (This was to centre around a vituperative correspondence in the Times.) But would the burgeoning reputation of the prize be damaged? He thought not. More important was our choice of winner. Antonia and I spoke up for Nadine Gordimer\u2019s The Conservationist, but Jane was less impressed. She remained keen on Ending Up, but realising that neither Antonia nor I would countenance it winning, she concentrated on Stanley Middleton\u2019s Holiday, a study of middle England that she saw as a \u201cperfect miniature\u201d.</p> <p>With only three judges, it seemed important to me that we did not compromise or produce a two-one verdict. Might we split the prize between Middleton and Gordimer? Martyn said he knew of no reason why not. We were vindicated by The Conservationist being selected this year for the Best of the Booker shortlist.</p> <p>My favourite Booker winner remains Schindler\u2019s Ark (1982) by Thomas Keneally (but I must declare my interest and say that I was its editor).</p> <h2>1975 Susan Hill</h2> <p>Peter Ackroyd was the young, newly appointed literary editor of the Spectator. Roy Fuller was a distinguished older poet. Angus Wilson was in his years as founder of the creative writing course at UEA and one of the elder statesmen of the contemporary novel. It was a daunting experience to join them as a judge. I took the mountain of submitted novels on my honeymoon, and our first meeting was scheduled for the day I returned. I discovered that Angus had spent a holiday at the same Italian hotel a few weeks earlier. So we should all have been in mellow mood, and three of us were. But Roy Fuller was not the easiest man to work with. He was acerbic and disliked being contradicted, and when it came to choosing a shortlist he refused to join in, on the grounds that we had agreed on our winner, so a shortlist was superfluous. The Booker management committee was, rightly, having none of this and insisted. </p> <p>I had been shortlisted myself three years earlier, and it had given my career a huge boost. I fought hard. We all did. Fuller grudgingly agreed to allowing a shortlist of two - the winner and one runner-up. Otherwise, he was going to walk. It was tricky and it spoiled what should have been an enjoyable experience. I was very happy with our winner, Ruth Prawer Jhabvala\u2019s Heat and Dust, but I wish we had stood up to Fuller and if he had walked out, so be it. </p> <p>My personal Best of Bookers is JG Farrell\u2019s The Siege of Krishnapur. The omission of Penelope Fitzgerald\u2019s masterpiece The Blue Flower even from the shortlist in 1995 I find quite inexplicable. </p> <h2>1976 Francis King</h2> <p>There is a vast difference of scale between the prize as I experienced it as a judge and how it is now. Then the prize money was far less generous, and the fee for the judging was an honorarium. There were only three judges: our chairman Walter Allen, an admirable novelist and critic, then confined to a wheelchair, so that I had to read out his presentation speech for him; Mary Wilson, the wife of the prime minister; and me. Despite his failing health, Allen was, unlike me, immensely conscientious in reading every submission from cover to cover. Mary Wilson, a lover of poetry and herself an artless but often touching poet, was at the disadvantage of having read few novels in the course of her life - so that she was clearly puzzled when I referred to one of the submissions as \u201cKafkaesque\u201d. </p> <p>My sister Elizabeth looked through the piles of books awaiting my reading, and eventually held up David Storey\u2019s Saville. With a colleague, John Guest, she had already put in a lot of robust work as one of its two editors. \u201cThis will be the winner,\u201d she announced. It was, she explained, an epic about a north country mining community and was therefore exactly what would appeal to Allen, a lifetime socialist, and to the wife of a Labour PM. She was right. I battled for Julian Rathbone\u2019s King Fisher Lives, to no avail. Mary Wilson was obdurate: \u201cI couldn\u2019t be party to giving the prize to a book about cannibalism.\u201d </p> <p>For me far and away the best Booker winner in the whole history of the Prize is JG Farrell\u2019s The Siege of Krishnapur. The best of all the novels that ought to have won the Prize but failed to do so is Penelope Fitzgerald\u2019s masterpiece The Blue Flower</p> <h2>1977 Beryl Bainbridge</h2> <p>Making a choice was very difficult - because it was this great prize of the world, one had to be very careful. Since I was published by Duckworth, it was very peculiar to have a Duckworth novel - Great Granny Webster by Caroline Blackwood - included in the vote. I put my vote forward - for Blackwood - but the discussion on it lasted only about three minutes, because it was such a short book. So nobody was really interested in that. All I can remember of the final meeting is that I got terribly tired, I literally sank lower and lower under the table. Brendan Gill, who I thought was American, went towards the balcony saying he was going to throw himself off, he was so fed up. Philip Larkin was completely silent most of the time. Nobody dared say a word to him and he never said a word back. The only one who was in total control of everything was Robin Ray. He was so clever that we all went along with whatever he said, and he wanted Staying On by Paul Scott to win. Poor Scott was too ill to collect the prize.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been shortlisted for the Booker five times and never won. I\u2019m just very pleased to have been noticed.</p> <h2>1978 Derwent May</h2> <p>In 1978, all the five jury members had a different first choice, and they were all sticking to it. Suddenly someone suggested a compromise candidate that we all quite liked, but it seemed to me that we were now heading for disaster. Freddie Ayer, the chairman, had more or less pulled out, saying that the only novels he enjoyed reading were crime novels. So I went round the jury - the other three were all novelists, PH Newby, Angela Huth and Clare Boylan - and said to them in turn \u201cIs this book your first choice?\u201d All, rather sheepishly, said \u201cNo\u201d. I said, \u201cThe winner must surely be at least one person\u2019s first choice\u201d, and I saw it was the moment for me to push what I thought was unmistakably the best book, Iris Murdoch\u2019s The Sea, The Sea - which I knew was at least one juror\u2019s second choice (the other shortlisted authors were Kingsley Amis, Andr\u00e9 Brink, Penelope Fitzgerald, Jane Gardam and Bernice Rubens). I\u2019m glad to say it won. </p> <p>The best three winners have, I think, been the Murdoch, William Golding\u2019s Rites of Passage and Kazuo Ishiguro\u2019s The Remains of the Day. The prize has always lurched too much in favour of writers with unpromising backgrounds or good liberal attitudes, but it has unfailingly provided an excellent focus on the year\u2019s new novels.</p> <h2>1979 Hilary Spurling </h2> <p>I loved my Booker summer, which boils down in my memory to long, hot, hazy days spent lying under a tree in the garden reading novels and saying to anyone who tried to interrupt: \u201cGo away, I\u2019m working.\u201d It was a strong field and the bookies\u2019 favourite was VS Naipaul\u2019s A Bend in the River. Its opponents on the panel argued that the book shouldn\u2019t strictly be classified as a novel, and in any case he\u2019d won the prize before. The Naipaul lobby (including me) snapped back that the novel was doomed if it couldn\u2019t expand to include this sort of documentary fiction, and that our job was to pick the year\u2019s best book, regardless of its author.</p> <p>The final verdict was as much of a shock to the judges as it was to everybody else. We\u2019d spent the entire afternoon at loggerheads, and in the end compromised by giving the prize to everybody\u2019s second choice, Penelope Fitzgerald\u2019s small, slight, melancholy but beautifully judged and executed Offshore. Her recently published collected letters make it clear that her triumph - and the general incredulity that greeted it - caused her humiliation ever after.</p> <h2>1980 Claire Tomalin</h2> <p>I was determined that Alice Munro should be on the shortlist, and stuck my heels in to get her there. There were two real contenders for the prize, I believed, Anthony Burgess\u2019s Earthly Powers and William Golding\u2019s Rites of Passage, and the night before the final judging session I lay awake debating with myself: the Golding beautifully written and constructed, but with a slightly musty feel about it; Burgess a magnificent entertainer, overflowing with good humour, sometimes tipping into the slapdash. Both books thoroughly deserving. The next morning David Daiches, our chairman, began: \u201cWe\u2019ll go through the list in alphabetical order. I take it no one consider Burgess a possible winner?\u201d Silence from the others. I exploded into a eulogy of Burgess\u2019s energy, invention and comic gift. I saw I had convinced no one, and felt that left only Golding. And so it was. Burgess sent a message saying he would not come to the dinner unless he won. I don\u2019t blame him. I saw a tear trickle down Golding\u2019s cheek when the announcement was made. I have re-read neither book, and I have rejoiced to see Alice Munro win the recognition she deserves. </p> <h2>1981 Hermione Lee</h2> <p>Salman Rushdie has won the Booker of Bookers and the Best of all Bookers, with his lastingly dazzling, deep and splendid novel, now a classic of world literature, Midnight\u2019s Children. But over a quarter of a century ago, when I was one of the judges who gave him the prize, his book was by no means an easy winner. Not many people had heard of Rushdie, unless they\u2019d read a weird piece of science fiction called Grimus or seen the stunning extracts from the new novel in Granta. Our panel of judges (Samuel Hynes, Joan Bakewell, Brian Aldiss and me, with Malcolm Bradbury as chair) were pulling in different ways. We were reading many writers with more established reputations, and much more experience, than Rushdie - such as Muriel Spark. (To my lasting regret, we overlooked one of Nadine Gordimer\u2019s best novels, July\u2019s People.) Brian Aldiss was especially keen on Doris Lessing\u2019s \u201cspace fiction\u201d The Sirian Experiments, Malcolm on Ian McEwan\u2019s The Comfort of Strangers. </p> <p>We all jumped at the late arrival of the almost forgotten Anglo-Irish writer Molly Keane, the short-listing of whose wicked and eccentric novel Good Behaviour gained her a devoted new following. But our final discussion was painfully split between Midnight\u2019s Children and The White Hotel, DM Thomas\u2019s psychoanalytical erotic novel, centring on the massacre at Babi Yar, which made a strong impression on me at the time but now, looking back, seems to me sensationalist and exploitative. Sam Hynes, Joan Bakewell and I were firmly on the side of Rushdie; Brian Aldiss was passionately keen on Thomas, and so was Malcolm Bradbury, who tried at the very end of the discussion to argue that the chair should have a casting, and over-ruling vote. This was not allowed, Rushdie won by 3 votes to 2, and Brian Aldiss (whose intensity impressed me) left the room with tears in his eyes. When the 1981 prize was announced, a mighty career was launched. It would have taken off anyway, but it was helped by the prize. Chairing the prize 25 years on, I felt happy to be helping on Kiran Desai, a literary descendant of Rushdie\u2019s.</p> <h2>1982 Paul Bailey</h2> <p>There are many things I regret doing, and being a judge for the Booker prize is one of them. For some years after I was associated with two novels I absolutely loathed and would not have even started reading in other circumstances (on the shortlist that year were Thomas Keneally\u2019s Schindler\u2019s Ark, John Arden\u2019s Silence Among the Weapons, William Boyd\u2019s An Ice-Cream War, Lawrence Durrell\u2019s Constance or Solitary Practices, Alice Thomas Ellis\u2019s The 27th Kingdom and Timothy Mo\u2019s Sour Sweet). They are history now and are likely to remain so. My one good deed was to ensure a place on the shortlist for Sour Sweet, consequently bringing his work to a larger audience. But otherwise it was a dispiriting experience. The winner, by a single vote, was Schindler\u2019s Ark, a controversial but ultimately very popular choice.</p> <p>The prize was founded, in part, to encourage competitiveness. Which of the six novelists will make it to the finishing post? This grisly notion constitutes a perfect recipe for envy, back-biting and self-glorification. The Booker has certainly mirrored fashion - the collapse of the empire; post-modernist Victorian pastiche; New Age sentimentality. Several stinkers have been honoured, but there have been some glorious losers: Alice Munro\u2019s The Beggar Maid, John McGahern\u2019s Amongst Women and Edward St Aubyn\u2019s Mother\u2019s Milk. A wonderful book such as Penelope Fitzgerald\u2019s The Blue Flower was completely ignored, and I hope the judges for 1995 are blushing now to be reminded of their grotesque oversight.</p> <h2>1983 Fay Weldon</h2> <p>A lively year, as Booker prizes go. We had a distinguished set of judges and some terrific books. The panel was finally split between a Coetzee and a Rushdie - a clash of continents. As the chairperson I had the casting vote - which is not saying \u201coh, I like that one best\u201d, but weighing up the arguments of one set of judges against the others and deciding which are the most convincing. The Coetzee (Life &amp; Times of Michael K) got it, and Rushdie was really annoyed. </p> <p>As a fervent feminist (25 years back), and taking time to make up my mind, I made a joke: \u201cI haven\u2019t got my husband here to help me decide.\u201d But one should never make jokes in the presence of the police, security or at a Booker prize judging, and word got round that I meant it. Then I had to deliver the customary chairperson\u2019s speech. After I sat down, the then president of the Publishers Association got to his feet, crossed the room and hit my agent Giles Gordon, second best thing to hitting me. I\u2019d used the speech to reproach the publishers for giving such rotten deals to writers. Since the BBC was working to rule, they cut the cameras at 10pm precisely: I was using transparent screens from which to make the speech (a Thatcher trick), and they went blank before I had time to finish with the usual pacifying bit about how you are all honourable men and none of what I say applies to you. Instead, I just had to sit down and all hell broke loose. </p> <p>I had actually shown the speech to the organisers earlier, but I suppose they hadn\u2019t bothered to read it. I hadn\u2019t thought it was all that inflammatory. Michael Caine, charismatic chairman of Bookers, came up to me years later, when I had been inadvertently invited to one of the subsequent dinners, and said: \u201cIt is not by any wish of mine you are here tonight.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s all got rather dull since: the prize tends to go to well-behaved and deserving writers: no subversion allowed. No one hits anyone. </p> <h2>1984 John Fuller</h2> <p>This was the year when the hot favourite, JG Ballard (Empire of the Sun), was passed over for a relative newcomer, Anita Brookner (Hotel du Lac). Hardly a scandal, but in a strong year we had already discarded some big names (Burgess, Golding, Spark, Bainbridge, two Amises, etc) before reaching the shortlist, so that journalistic antennae were twitching, and the outcome was felt to be a further surprise. The judges got on pretty well together. We were somewhat exercised by the question of whether Julian Barnes\u2019s Flaubert\u2019s Parrot was really a novel, while in the final judging session Anthony Curtis continued to argue for David Lodge (Small World), and Ted Rowlands stuck out for the Ballard. I thought that the Brookner was, in its economy and elegance, a small triumph of moral insight worthy of the tradition of James and Forster to which it belonged. I was relieved to have support from Polly Devlin and the somewhat eccentric Richard Cobb in this, and pleased at the nudge to her career that the prize must have given. </p> <h2>1985 Marina Warner</h2> <p>Norman St John Stevas was our chair, and early on that summer he picked out a number of books which he recommended his panel to read. Among them was a surprise, a bulky novel called The Bone People by Keri Hulme. Alongside the many gleamingly designed offerings from the major publishing houses, it had the distinction of being published by a women\u2019s cooperative in New Zealand, who, when the book won the prize against very high odds, came up in full island dress to collect it, chanting a Maori praise song. </p> <p>Feelings in the final meeting - and afterwards - ran very high about this novel, but St John Stevas unexpectedly championed it throughout. Nina Bawden opposed it very strongly on the grounds of its violence (the novel tells a terrifying story of child-beatings), and wrote later publicly to distance herself from the decision. Nina found herself significantly outnumbered in her opposition, because Joanna Lumley didn\u2019t attend the final judging. She sent a message to say she was in rehearsal and that her nominated winner was Doris Lessing, for The Good Terrorist. When she heard The Bone People had won, she too dissociated herself from the judgment. JW Lambert and I supported the book. </p> <p>I think that the best argument for the whole cruel and unfair business of prizes is that they can lead readers to writers who wouldn\u2019t otherwise be read much or perhaps at all. I didn\u2019t think Lessing needed the prize (and she would agree) and certainly not for a novel that is not her best (though it\u2019s a feature of prizes that authors often win for their weakest works). </p> <h2>1986 Anthony Thwaite</h2> <p>My chairing of the 1986 judges was marred, or enlivened, by several scandals or leaks or items of gossip. I was said (wrongly) to have lectured my fellow judges on \u201chow to read a novel\u201d. I unwisely wrote to Julian Barnes to commiserate with him about his non-appearance on the shortlist: I was quoted as blaming it on \u201call those women\u201d (my four fellow judges were Edna Healey, Isabel Quigly, Gillian Reynolds and Bernice Rubens).</p> <p>It was a splendid shortlist: Kingsley Amis, Margaret Atwood, Paul Bailey, Robertson Davies, Kazuo Ishiguro, Timothy Mo. We were still going to and fro up until 10 minutes before the press announcement had to be made: two strongly for Amis, two equally strongly for Davies (What\u2019s Bred in the Bone), and a wobbler in the middle. At the last moment the wobbler came down on the side of The Old Devils, and Amis had won. A very satisfactory result, I thought.</p> <h2>1987 PD James</h2> <p>I look back on my chairmanship in 1987 as a very happy experience, particularly as I had as my colleagues four hardworking, enthusiastic and knowledgeable judges: Lady Selina Hastings, Allan Massie, Trevor McDonald and John B Thompson. I did have a fear at the time - and still do - that to ask the panel to read more than 100 novels in a comparatively short time can result in a literary surfeit which makes the final judgment more difficult. Choosing the winner was a long process, and I remember scurrying to the dinner table a little after the meal had started. At the end, however, the vote was unanimous - Penelope Lively won, for Moon Tiger - which is what I had hoped for. The Booker may at times have tended to increase the unhelpful dichotomy between popular storytelling and books which are classified as literary novels, but most of the winners have combined high literary achievement with compelling storytelling. </p> <h2>1988 Blake Morrison</h2> <p>We were a jury of writers that year: Sebastian Faulks, Rose Tremain, Philip French and, in the chair, Michael Foot, who seemed keener to talk about Byron than to reminisce about leading the Labour party. As early as our first meeting, Peter Carey\u2019s Oscar and Lucinda was the clear frontrunner. The only arguments were about which novels should be with him on the shortlist. I read the bulk of the 100 or so entries during a fortnight\u2019s holiday with two small children in Wales, rising early and retiring late. Those we finally settled on were Salman Rushdie\u2019s The Satanic Verses (which I read with innocent pleasure - the controversy over it didn\u2019t erupt till the following year), Bruce Chatwin\u2019s Utz (his last novel - his funeral was the day of the fatwa), David Lodge\u2019s Nice Work (one of his best), Penelope Fitzgerald\u2019s The Beginning of Spring (one of her best) and Marina Warner\u2019s The Lost Father. </p> <p>My biggest regret was failing to get Doris Lessing\u2019s The Fifth Child on the shortlist - though in retrospect Alan Hollinghurst\u2019s first novel, The Swimming-Pool Library, was a graver omission. The final meeting lasted 25 minutes: Foot was for Rushdie, the rest of us were for Carey, so that was that. Rushdie has sometimes been caricatured as a bad loser, but at the ceremony he behaved impeccably and was generous in his praise of the winning book. All in all, a pleasing outcome. My other experiences of sitting on prize juries have been grisly in comparison.</p> <h2>1989 David Lodge</h2> <p>Our shortlist meeting was the longest to date, and much of it was taken up with discussion of Martin Amis\u2019s London Fields. It is public knowledge that two of the judges on the panel, Maggie Gee and Helen McNeil, successfully resisted its inclusion on the shortlist, an outcome I still regret. The final judging session was uncontroversial - all but one of us were unequivocally in favour of Kazuo Ishiguro\u2019s The Remains of the Day. I consider it one of the best Booker winners I have read. </p> <p>The success of the prize has had an enormous impact on the reception of literary fiction and other kinds of writing, not only directly, but also indirectly through the proliferation of new prizes that have imitated it. But the overtly competitive nature of these prizes, heightened by the publication of longlists and shortlists, takes its psychological toll on writers; and, given the large element of chance in the composition and operation of judging panels, the importance now attached to prizes in our literary culture seems excessive. A committee is a blunt instrument of literary criticism.</p> <h2>1990 Hilary Mantel </h2> <p>Not a discourteous word was exchanged between the hardworking 1990 judges - much to the disappointment of the administrator Martyn Goff, who praised us to our faces and later whined that we were boring. Denis Forman ran the meetings with smooth expertise, and largely kept his own opinions dark until he cast the final vote.</p> <p>Weeks before I was appointed a judge, I\u2019d read John McGahern\u2019s Amongst Women and said, reaching page 20, \u201cThis will win the Booker\u201d. So I was disappointed, but AS Byatt\u2019s Possession was a good book and a popular choice, and the discussion was fair. The process exhausted me, and I declined to do it a second time. What I despised was the leaking by the publicity machine of trivial non-stories to the press - I felt the prize had enough status and news value without that. I also believe the judges shouldn\u2019t review the books under consideration or talk about them in public, and in 1990 we didn\u2019t.</p> <p>I\u2019m glad I was a Booker judge relatively early in my career. It stopped me thinking that literary prizes are about literary value. Even the most correct jury goes in for horsetrading and gamesmanship, and what emerges is a compromise. </p> <p>For me the best of the Bookers is The Siege of Krishnapur. I read it again a few months ago and its supple humour, its insight, economy and narrative drive make it an enduring delight.</p> <h2>1991 Nicholas Mosley</h2> <p>I was asked to be a judge probably because I had just won the Whitbread the previous year. This had itself been a surprise, because it seemed I was out of favour with the literary establishment, having been labelled a \u201cnovelist of ideas\u201d while what was in favour was \u201cstyle\u201d. And style seemed most easily to be exhibited in stories that were outlandish, or grim, or quaint. I looked forward to judging the Booker because I thought I might give a boost to \u201cideas\u201d. There were five judges, and we had to choose six books out of 100 for the shortlist. I thought - well, surely, with this set-up I\u2019ll be able to squeeze in one choice of mine. But, in the event, I got none of my choices on to the list, because of the inflexibility of the voting system and of the other four judges, who were devotees of \u201cstyle\u201d. So I resigned, partly in a huff, but also because I thought that by so doing I might still be able to strike a blow for \u201cideas\u201d, as I might be asked to explain myself in the press - which I did.</p> <p>The winner chosen by the remaining judges was Ben Okri\u2019s The Famished Road - a beautifully written (yes) story of a boy in a west African village who goes to and fro between his family and the local witchdoctor. My choice would have been Allan Massie\u2019s The Sins of the Father, which confronted the issue of what was possible or impossible if the child of a notorious ex-Nazi and the child of a Jewish victim fell in love after the second world war. What could be forgiven, and by whom, and what could not. But these are controversial questions, and thus conventionally to be avoided.</p> <h2>1992 Victoria Glendinning</h2> <p>My fellow judges were John Coldstream, literary editor of the Telegraph, Harriet Harvey-Wood, literary director of the British Council, Valentine Cunningham and Mark Lawson. We became intimate in the way of people thrown together in a scary but non-fatal railway accident. John dreamt one night that he was Spartacus, with the Roman legions advancing on him in the form of piles of new titles. It was a vintage year for rent-a-sneer in the media. Prominent journalists whinged chauvinistically about \u201cfar-flung authors\u201d, deaf to the explosion of energy from Commonwealth novelists, which has been the most significant feature of the Booker\u2019s 40 years. The prize was \u201cessentially trivial\u201d, pontificated AN Wilson in contemptuous mode in the Evening Standard; and, enraged, I wrote to the Guardian letters page to contest Richard Gott\u2019s clich\u00e9s about the decline of the novel and what he called the \u201ctokenism\u201d of the inclusion of Mich\u00e8le Roberts on the shortlist.</p> <p>Every book on our shortlist had one passionate supporter and one furious antagonist. When at the final meeting we locked horns over the frontrunners, it was suggested that we should reach our decision by taking into account second choices - proportional representation. This procedure gave Michael Ondaatje (The English Patient) and Barry Unsworth (Sacred Hunger) equal points. I turned to Martyn Goff, sitting behind me discreetly - or as discreetly as anyone can who is wearing a gold satin tie - and asked if we could share the prize between the two. He conceded there was no rule against it. So that\u2019s what we did.</p> <p>Before the meeting, I was so unnerved that I left my bag with all my notes in it at the bank. When stressed I become sharp-tongued, and at one point told a fellow judge that he was a condescending bastard. My notes on our sessions are, at this distance in time, enigmatic. What in the world, for example, was Val Cunningham on about when he said: \u201cI am very interested in Huntley &amp; Palmer\u2019s biscuits and their role in literature\u201d? </p> <h2>1993 Gillian Beer</h2> <p>Olivier Todd, the French novelist, shrugged his shoulders at our second judges\u2019 meeting: no lunches with publishers, no approaches from agents, he complained - what an odd English bubble of propriety we were gathered inside. He was joking, but only just. And it is one of the remarkable things about being a Booker judge that no one tempts you with hospitality. You simply sit and read, and talk, and read again, over several months. The pleasure is in the reading, and in the talk. One of the rewards of going to see a new film is the conversation straight after, but reading new novels can be a lonely business. Not in this case. In 1993 I remember impassioned defences of books one of us had grown attached to, but no quarrels, just engrossing talk. Our chair, Grey Gowrie, came up with an ingenious criterion: novels must have \u201cradioactivity\u201d to stay in the running. He meant we must remember them weeks, months later. They mustn\u2019t fade. A self-proving criterion perhaps, but reassuring.</p> <p>One novel that certainly had that quality and yet just missed the shortlist was Trainspotting and it was in arguing about Irvine Welsh\u2019s book that we came nearest to quarrelling. Getting from long to shortlist was painful, worse than sorting out the winner among that final six. Some wanted the prize to go to David Malouf\u2019s Remembering Babylon, while Caryl Phillips\u2019s Crossing the River and Carol Shields\u2019s The Stone Diaries had strong support as well. But Roddy Doyle\u2019s Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha won the day with its extraordinary technical achievement and its emotional force, taking us inside the voice and experience of a 10-year-old boy in the midst of family break-up.</p> <h2>1994 James Wood</h2> <p>After serving on the 1994 Booker prize committee, I made a pledge never to judge a big fiction prize again, and I have so far honoured it. We were a congenial group, and our chairman was not a former politician or bureaucrat but a distinguished literary critic (John Bayley); our meetings were friendly, and surely no less or more argumentative than those of other years. But the absurdity of the process was soon apparent: it is almost impossible to persuade someone else of the quality or poverty of a selected novel (a useful lesson in the limits of literary criticism). In practice, judge A blathers on about his favourite novel for five minutes, and then judge B blathers on about her favourite novel for five minutes, and nothing changes: no one switches sides. That is when the horse-trading begins. I remember that one of the judges phoned me and said, in effect: \u201cI know that you especially like novel X, and you know that I especially like novel Y. It would be good if both those books got on to the shortlist, yes? So if you vote for my novel, I\u2019ll vote for yours, OK?\u201d</p> <p>That is how our shortlist was patched together, and it is how our winner was chosen. It is how every shortlist is chosen, whether the premises are as explicit or not. I liked the winning book a great deal (James Kelman\u2019s How Late It Was, How Late) - it was one of my choices - and would have been happy with either that book or Alan Hollinghurst\u2019s The Folding Star. But I intensely disliked the way we reached that verdict, and felt that the arbitrary, utterly political process discredited the whole project.</p> <p>Since then, prizes have become a form of reviewing: it is prize-lists that select what people read, prize-lists that make literary careers. Bookshops order novels based on the prizes they have won or been shortlisted for. Nowadays, a whole month before the shortlist is announced, scores of novelists are effectively told that their books have not been the \u201cbig books\u201d of the year, because they are not to be found on the longlist. Soon, no doubt, we will have the long-longlist, and the long-long longlist. Some wonderful books win the Booker, of course, just as the flypaper occasionally catches some really large flies. But it means - or should mean - nothing in literary terms.</p> <h2>1995 Ruth Rendell</h2> <p>I was always being asked what it was like to be on the Booker \u201cjury\u201d. But I could never see us as that. Jurors have to decide between guilt and innocence while we had to pick the best. The best of 140 in our case - or 6.3 books a week. Reading that number is normal for me, but books I want to read, not ones I have to. It makes a big difference. We got on well, we judges. We disagreed but never quite quarrelled. I used to lie and say I read every word of every book. The truth is that I did my best, but I am a judicious skipper. Going home to Suffolk, I finished a novel and left it in the train. A man called out to me that I\u2019d forgotten it, but when I said to keep it he was delighted. I hope he liked it better than I did. </p> <p>So what did I get out of being a judge? The pleasure of giving the prize to Pat Barker\u2019s The Ghost Road, my choice, not one I was persuaded into. A mild antipathy to new novels so that now I tend to read more non-fiction. And my friendship with Peter Kemp, a fellow judge, which began in those Booker days. </p> <h2>1996 Jonathan Coe</h2> <p>How very arbitrary it seems, in retrospect. There was nothing wrong with our shortlist, and nothing wrong with our winner (Last Orders, by Graham Swift), but at 12 years\u2019 distance, it feels as though we could easily have chosen another six novels altogether. Our discussions were lengthy - and amicable, for the most part (until the final session, when tempers started to fray) - but what strikes me now about the whole process was how entirely subjective it was. Anyone who sets great store by the choices of Booker prize panels should remember this: the process consists of nothing more rigorous than five people sitting in a room together for a few hours, swapping personal opinions. And as far as I remember, not a single judge (including me) ever changed his or her mind, or shifted his or her position, in response to an argument put forward by a colleague. In the midst of it all, the novel which I now remember as being the finest of all - Asylum, by Patrick McGrath - slipped through our net, and failed to make the shortlist by a whisker. If it had reached the shortlist, such is the randomness of the final selection process, it might easily have won the prize itself.</p> <h2>1997 Jason Cowley</h2> <p>Before the longlist was made public, if you wanted to know which books were in contention you would usually be able to find out by having a discreet lunch with Martyn Goff, the charming and mischievous prize administrator who used to operate his own idiosyncratic system of leaks, withholding and revealing in equal measure. I remember turning up to the meeting at which our shortlist would be decided to be received with suspicion by our chairman, Gillian Beer. She wanted to know how our longlist was being discussed in the papers, and I was pretty sure by the way she looked at me that she thought I was responsible. Certainly I\u2019d been having fun writing polemical pieces about the state of the British novel. </p> <p>I believed then as I do now that the Booker is essentially a jamboree, little more than a kind of sport, with its own roster of winners and losers. It shouldn\u2019t be dignified or taken too seriously. But I wasn\u2019t the leaker. As we sat down for the lunch that preceded our discussions, and with Gillian Beer still grumbling about the longlist leaking out, I heard Goff say: \u201cIt\u2019s quite extraordinary. I don\u2019t know how it happened.\u201d He then, winningly, glanced at me and winked. </p> <p>I often think that I\u2019ve never quite recovered from my experience of being a judge. I began the year as an enthusiastic and engaged reader and reviewer of contemporary fiction, and ended it much more interested in non-fiction and narrative journalism. And of all the novels I read that year there are perhaps only two that I could ever imagine rereading: Arundhati Roy\u2019s The God of Small Things (our unfairly maligned winner) and Ian McEwan\u2019s Enduring Love (which just missed out on being shortlisted and divided the judges more than any other entry). </p> <h2>1998 Douglas Hurd</h2> <p>This was a quiet year. There were no sensational or overpowering entries, and no passionate disputes among the judges. The crafty device of holding the final meeting of the judges immediately before the award dinner certainly concentrated the mind. The prize went to Amsterdam by Ian McEwan, not because we thought it was about time he won the Booker, but because in a mild year most people (though not the chairman) thought his offering finished just ahead of Beryl Bainbridge, riding Master Georgie</p> <h2>1999 Shena Mackay</h2> <p>It was a very strong year for fiction. When I was a judge - alongside Boyd Tonkin, Natasha Walter and John Sutherland, with Gerald Kaufman in the chair - several books assumed to be shoo-ins weren\u2019t on the shortlist, which caused dismay, as did the discovery by some authors that their books had not been entered, on the presumption that the judges would call them in. We failed to do so. Sorry. Pressures of time and books arriving late.</p> <p>Our shortlisted authors were JM Coetzee, Anita Desai, Michael Frayn, Andrew O\u2019Hagan, Ahdaf Soueif and Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn. We gave the prize - controversially because he had won in 1983 - to Coetzee for Disgrace. We were vindicated recently when it was shortlisted for the Best of Bookers. John Sutherland was a strong advocate of Salman Rushdie (The Ground Beneath Her Feet) in our year, and he must be delighted that Midnight\u2019s Children has won the Booker of Bookers for the second time.</p> <p>Our chief dispute arose from John\u2019s gadfly comments in this newspaper. As far as I remember, it was the suggestion that Natasha Walter and I had a feminist agenda which prompted Natasha to write a letter to the Guardian, which I signed. Being a judge gave me much more anxiety than being on the shortlist myself, even with the horrible bookies\u2019 odds and the risk of being depicted as a cartoon racehorse, because as a judge you are responsible for disappointing a lot of people.</p> <h2>2000 Rose Tremain</h2> <p>My second stint as a Booker prize judge contrasted with the first in one important respect: we had an extremely effective and powerful chair in Simon Jenkins. In 1988, the lovable Michael Foot had been hampered, as chair, by diary overspill. But Simon\u2019s influence on the 2000 jury was impressive. Meetings were held at his rooms in Albany, rather than at Martyn Goff\u2019s preferred venue of the Savile Club. Despite the constant lamentations of his fax machine, Simon\u2019s attention never strayed from the tasks in hand, the first of which was to kick out the dross. Roy Foster, Caroline Gascoigne, Mariella Frostrup and I were a vocal team and we each had our favourites. Mariella was able to squeeze Matthew Kneale\u2019s English Passengers on to the list, and Caroline\u2019s advocacy for Kazuo Ishiguro\u2019s When We Were Orphans was duly recognised. Roy Foster and I lost our battle for Anne Enright\u2019s What Are You Like?, but my call-in title, Trezza Azzopardi\u2019s The Hiding Place, scraped home. </p> <p>What is really interesting is that nobody thought Margaret Atwood\u2019s The Blind Assassin was her best book. Where Simon\u2019s mental agility paid off was in persuading us all (except Mariella) that Atwood deserved the prize anyway - for all the times she\u2019d nearly won it and had been pipped at the post by a lesser writer. </p> <h2>2001 Philip Hensher</h2> <p>It\u2019s an unusual experience, reading for the Booker. For once in your life you take a synchronic slice through the English-language novel, and see exactly what\u2019s interesting it at that moment. I was lucky in having an excellent chairman in Kenneth Baker, unprejudiced, interested and diligent, and fellow judges who really knew about the novel - Kate Summerscale was particularly good to argue with. I think we made a good choice with Peter Carey\u2019s substantial True History of the Kelly Gang, but the whole shortlist was, in my view, exceptional. I regretted that media excitement over Beryl Bainbridge actually damaged her chances with According to Queeney. We realised that if we shortlisted her, she had to win. There was no point in blotting out the winner\u2019s publicity with a storm of \u201cBeryl Bridesmaid Again\u201d headlines. I wanted to do more for Nick Hornby\u2019s How to Be Good, and it was a relief that the Whitbread rewarded Philip Pullman\u2019s The Amber Spyglass, which we could easily have shortlisted. It was a good-humoured, interesting experience, but what I got most out of it was being introduced to new novelists - Zvi Jagendorf, Ciaran Carson, Jamie O\u2019Neill - however far they got in the judging process. </p> <p>The best novel to have been given the prize is, I think, Naipaul\u2019s In a Free State in 1971. </p> <h2>2002 Salley Vickers</h2> <p>I was a judge the year Life of Pi won, and there is no doubt that our choice was a rip-roaring popular success. The booksellers loved us for it. It was me, in fact, who first drew the other judges\u2019 attention to the novel. I was given it while on tour in Canada, by a Winnipeg bookseller, and read it excitedly on the plane home. We used to have extra meetings at the home of our chair, Lisa Jardine, and I recall telling all the other judges - Erica Wagner, Russell Celyn Jones and David Baddiel - about the book, which at that time had not been entered by Canongate. I was very glad to see it on to the shortlist, but it was not my final choice (the other books on the shortlist were Rohinton Mistry\u2019s Family Matters, Carol Shields\u2019s Unless, William Trevor\u2019s The Story of Lucy Gault, Sarah Waters\u2019s Fingersmith and Tim Winton\u2019s Dirt Music). However, Lisa was a skilled chair. She wanted a unanimous verdict and, much as I admired the book, I couldn\u2019t give her that. So she said, \u201cSalley, it was you who brought the book to our attention. Will you give the decision your blessing?\u201d Well, I couldn\u2019t refuse.</p> <h2>2003 DJ Taylor</h2> <p>I can\u2019t say that I enjoyed reading all the books - 113 of them, I believe, in that year - but there was a certain amount of pleasure to be gained from the attendant razzmatazz, the thought that for a very brief period in the year an artefact routinely overlooked by large swathes of an indifferent media was suddenly news. There were several memorable clashes of opinion, the funniest by far coming when the chair, John Carey, trying desperately to persuade us of the merits of Martin Amis\u2019s Yellow Dog, read aloud from a paragraph describing the death-throes of a dying fly, at which point Francine Stock and I caught each other\u2019s eye across the table and began to giggle. The judging process was pretty much a waste of time as all four of the other judges arrived at the longlist meeting convinced that DBC Pierre\u2019s Vernon God Little was one of the great masterpieces of the early 21st century, whereas I thought that it was a promising first novel. This meant that the final judging session lasted a bare 10 minutes, after which I had to sit discussing the existence (or non-existence) of God with AC Grayling, a subject on which both of us hold strong views.</p> <h2>2004 Tibor Fischer</h2> <p>I\u2019d heard the rumours. The hair-pulling, the eye-gouging, the shameful flouncing. I was, however, extremely impressed by the rigour of my fellow judges, who, unlike me, had proper jobs and families to distract them from the mound of books. What did I learn? Discussion is futile. No one changes their mind about a book. You might as well have a show of hands straight away. There aren\u2019t many bad books (only one novel ended up in the bin after two pages), but there are a lot of so-so, nondescript novels that leave no trace. Publishers are idiots. I was very pleased Alan Hollinghurst won. But I wouldn\u2019t say The Line of Beauty is a better novel than David Mitchell\u2019s very different Cloud Atlas (which came in second) or Neil Cross\u2019s Always the Sun (or others on the longlist).</p> <p>There are good reasons why Midnight\u2019s Children has been chosen as the Best of the Bookers (although every novelist I know rates Shame as Rushdie\u2019s best book), but it would have been a more interesting exercise to have chosen the best of the shortlisted novels. It\u2019s a pity that Beryl Bainbridge has always been pipped, and my favourite novel in the Booker annals (I\u2019ve read it at least a dozen times) is Derek Robinson\u2019s Goshawk Squadron</p> <h2>2005 John Sutherland</h2> <p>When I chaired year 37, it more or less, as airline pilots say, flew by wire. The year was, by general agreement, a bumper one for fiction. As usual, no minds were much changed by the panel discussions - candidate B merely came forward when one judge\u2019s candidate A was voted down. John Banville came out top with The Sea. King of the As and Bs. Teeth were gnashed in the press the next day; but they would be if Jesus Christ had written the winning novel. I spoke to Kazuo Ishiguro (shortlisted for Never Let Me Go) shortly after. \u201cThe goalkeeper jumped the wrong way\u201d, he sportingly said. I wish I\u2019d been quick-witted enough to rejoin \u201cnot even Petr Cech has to save five penalty shots all coming at him at once\u201d. Julian Barnes, in an interview for the New York Times, was more savage (he had been shortlisted for Arthur &amp; George). Not, he felt, a bumper year for judges. Perhaps he was right. But posterity will forget us. Barnes, Ishiguro and - I believe - Banville they\u2019ll remember. And make their own judgments. </p> <h2>2006 Anthony Quinn</h2> <p>I enjoyed every moment of the 2006 Booker until the very last minutes of our final meeting in the Guildhall. That was when I realised that the novel which I had set my heart on would not be the winner. On anecdotal evidence from friends who had judged the prize in previous years, I gathered that there was usually someone on the jury who would be a complete pest and make the whole process as awkward as possible. Not this time: our chairman, Hermione Lee, set a tone of almost heartless conviviality that Candia McWilliam, Fiona Shaw and Simon Armitage consistently upheld. Indeed, we had been so likeminded in the final reckoning of our shortlist that I must have blanked the ominous build-up of support for Kiran Desai\u2019s The Inheritance of Loss and assumed that everyone would come round to what was clearly the best book, Edward St Aubyn\u2019s Mother\u2019s Milk. When I was outvoted 4-1 I was surprised, and appalled. Six months of reading and re-reading - only to be thwarted at the last! I asked for a recount, which at least got a laugh. It\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that I felt sick to my stomach. I was pleased for Kiran Desai, who\u2019d spent eight years writing it. But we chose the wrong book. </p> <h2>2007 Giles Foden</h2> <p>Everyone expected arguments, and we had them, but with dignity (my fellow judges were Howard Davies, Wendy Cope, Ruth Scurr and Imogen Stubbs). We never fell out. In fact, we are meeting up this autumn for a drink. Some had their favourites that others couldn\u2019t stand; others tried to hold up yardsticks against which all books might be measured. The favourite supporters made persuasive cases for AN Wilson and Nicola Barker, but only Barker got through to the shortlist, despite an unfortunate error in transmission - not the judges\u2019 fault - which suggested Wilson had. The longlist is where the real argy-bargy takes place. </p> <p>Once an author is on the shortlist anything can happen. In our case we arrived at a situation in which every judge had mutually exclusive first and last choices. Luckily, in Howard Davies we had a competent chairman, who helped us mathematically towards a choice of winner with which everyone was happy. PS: note to publishers, try not to write call-in letters with spelling mistakes, or one that make foolish claims. Some of these letters looked as if they were written in haste. Then again, so did some of the novels submitted.</p> <h2>2008 Alex Clark</h2> <p>Before I was asked to judge this year\u2019s prize, I had been on several literary prize panels and I felt I had enough experience to know roughly what I was doing. But little can prepare you for the Booker: not just the sheer volume of books submitted, but the sense that you are about to be partly responsible for making an indelible mark on the literary landscape. Now, with the final hurdle fast approaching, I can say that it\u2019s been not only an enjoyable process but also an instructive one. Reading is, of course, a solitary affair, and book reviewing not much less so. But anatomising one\u2019s taste and judgment and then communicating it to a group of people with equally strong views has been a wonderful challenge - not least because it makes for scrutiny of what it is that one values in fiction. And, gruelling though it was, I wouldn\u2019t give up those late nights and early mornings spent poring over novels.</p> <h2>2009 John Mullan</h2> <p>My fellow judges were Lucasta Miller Jim Naughtie, Sue Perkins and Michael Prodger. I do confess that I already knew, at least slightly, all the other judges. Did this make it too cosy? Maybe, but the process is enough of a challenge to make conviviality a useful blessing. It felt as if there was rather little disagreement until the end, when suddenly it was sharp. On the very day of the dinner, you get shut in a room with sandwiches and orange juice, and chip away at your short list. I would have been happy to see Sarah Waters\u2019s The Little Stranger win, and I think in another year it might have done. But it came down to Wolf Hall versus Summertime: Mantel versus Coetzee.</p> <p>Two of the other judges, Lucasta and Sue, have written elsewhere of their<br>preference for Coetzee, so the voting can hardly be a secret. What I had not expected was that my cards would be the last to go on the table. </p> <p>Being a natural loudmouth, I had been trying to speak judiciously, and had ended up seeming to be biding my moment.

  "<p>So syrah and shiraz are genetically the same grape - but the wines they produce can be very different in style, depending on origin. The typical old-world syrah is lighter and leaner than the intense shiraz wines of the new world, which tend to be richer, riper and more full-bodied. In certain areas, the name you get on the bottle - syrah or shiraz - will be an indication of style rather than where it is from. </p> <p>Whatever you call it, some estimates put this as the world's fifth most planted red wine grape. Certain winegrowers in the northern Rh\u00f4ne distinguish between a small-berried, superior version of syrah, which they call petite syrah, and the larger-berried grosse syrah, but others reject any such distinction.</p> <p>Petite sirah (with an i, not a y) is quite different, the name given to what has been shown to be a common California field blend made up variously of syrah, durif and two other varieties related to them. It makes robust, tannic, earthy wines.</p> <p><strong>France</strong></p> <p>Syrah is the great grape of the northern Rh\u00f4ne, responsible for the dense, burly, deep-coloured, long-lived, savoury and peppery wines of Hermitage, and the slightly more seductively perfumed (traditionally thanks to some co-fermented viognier in the blend) C\u00f4te-R\u00f4tie. Unlike other varieties, it demonstrates a strict relationship between how severely it is pruned and how good the eventual wine is. It can also lose its aroma and acidity quickly if left past optimal ripening stage (both of which explain why so many, though by no means all, French varietal syrah vins de pays are so wishy-washy). Crozes-Hermitage is probably the best-value manifestation of syrah, although good St Joseph exists and Cornas is enjoying a revival.</p> <p><strong>Australia</strong></p> <p>Cuttings of syrah, called shiraz, were probably taken to Australia by the so-called father of Australian viticulture, James Busby, in the early 1830s. It flourished and spread, so much so that it was little treasured. Now, however, Australia has regained its pride in what is the country's most planted wine grape variety, which can taste of baked pencils in the Hunter Valley, cough syrup in the Barossa Valley (arguably its spiritual home), chocolate in McLaren Vale and black pepper in cooler parts of Victoria and New South Wales. </p> <p>The great majority of Australian winemakers produce a shiraz of some sort, and many make several qualities of shiraz, as well as a range of shiraz-cabernet blends. Penfolds is arguably the past master of shiraz production - its Grange being Australia's first serious collectable. When it was made, by the late Max Schubert after a trip to Bordeaux, it was dismissed as \"dry port tasting of crushed ants\". In general terms, shiraz tends to taste slightly sweet and can reach high alcohol levels. Such was the success of Australian shiraz in the early years of this century that the name shiraz has been widely adopted for syrah grown in many other parts of the world.</p> <p><strong>Elsewhere</strong></p> <p>Syrah was enthusiastically planted in California in the 1990s by the so-called Rh\u00f4ne Rangers, who were anxious to demonstrate that it may be even better suited to California than cabernet sauvignon. Wine buyers have been less enthusiastic about it, however. There have been some notable examples in Washington state as well as in South America, particularly Chile. South African shiraz, generally from younger vines, can taste rather earthy and hot. Some of those who make the finest South African examples label them syrah. There are some notable syrahs in both Italy and Iberia, even if the grape remains a minority ingredient in the varietal makeup of vineyards there. It can also make some fine wine in sunnier spots in Switzerland's Valais.</p> <h2>Victoria Moore recommends</h2> <p><strong>One to drink now</strong></p> <p><strong>Vin de Pays des Coteaux de l'Ardeche Syrah 2006, France</strong><br><strong>\u00a35.50, Nicolas</strong></p> <p>Some of the world's best syrah is grown in the northern Rh\u00f4ne, where it makes dark, brooding - and expensive - wines. By contrast, this humble vin de pays is about as light a version of a syrah as you will find, but it still carries the grape's violet and mulberry perfume. A rare find from the usually expensive Nicolas. A good weekday buy. </p> <p><strong>One to lust after</strong></p> <p><strong>Shaw &amp; Smith Shiraz 2006 Adelaide Hills, Australia</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00a316.95-\u00a320.75, Bennetts Fine Wines, Chipping Campden; </strong><br><strong>Noel Young Wines, Cambridge; Philglas &amp; Swiggot </strong></p> <p>With a jolt of cracked black pepper and a soul-warming stream of fruit, reigned in and run through with French oak, this is a super wine that should appeal also to openminded old world fans. It's bottled under screwcap, though, and needs stirring up when you open it - pour from jug to jug for a bit to bring it to life. <br><strong>Victoria Moore</strong></p> <h2>Drink with</h2> <p>Chargrilled aged rib of beef rubbed with sea salt and finished with a decent slug of peppery olive oil needs wine with both muscle and structure to match. This is gutsy red territory, and shiraz or syrah, with its weight, texture and ripeness of fruit, is a great option. As with other full-bodied red/meat matches, dark fruit will naturally knit with the sweetness of the meat, while firm, drying tannins work to break down protein, cut through fat and clean your palate. <br><strong>Matt Skinner</strong></p> <h2>Background</h2> <p><strong>Say it right </strong>Si-rar/she-raz</p> <p><strong>Makes</strong> spicy and full-bodied wines, with high tannins that help it age for years</p> <p><strong>Hotspots</strong> Northern Rh\u00f4ne in France, Barossa Valley in Australia</p> <p><strong>Legends</strong> Hermitage and C\u00f4te-R\u00f4tie AOCs in France; Penfolds Grange in Australia</p> <p><strong>Good companions </strong>Typically blended with grenache and mourv\u00e8dre in the southern Rh\u00f4ne, and with cabernet sauvignon in Australia</p> <p><strong>Need to know</strong> Recent DNA tests pinpointed the birth of syrah to be around 2,000 years ago in the Rh\u00f4ne Valley</p> <p><strong>If you like</strong> shiraz, try zinfandel </p> <p><em>\"What is man, when you think upon him, but a minutely set, ingenious machine for turning, with infinite artfulness, the red wine of shiraz into urine?\"</em><br><strong>Isak Dinesen, Seven Gothic Tales, 1934</strong></p>",
  "<h2>Who should I call for a makeover?</h2> <p><strong>I recently bought a second-floor flat, and need to get it rewired and replumbed. I would also like to open up the kitchen to the living room and install a new kitchen, boiler and central heating - and I'd like it all done as green as possible. The bathroom and kitchen are at opposite ends of the flat, so routing of plumbing and wiring will be tricky. Who do I need to help me? An architect, structural engineer, separate plumber/electrician/builder? I'm baffled!</strong></p> <p>Let's separate the issues. You're not adding volume to your property or interfering with exterior or party walls, so the good news is you're not in the realm of planning permission or even permitted development. But you will have to deal with building regulations, because you're opening up between kitchen and lounge, and there are rules governing fire doors, ventilation, etc. An architect could design the layout, put the job out to tender, project manage it, and deal with any rules and regs - but they don't come cheap: expect to pay a percentage of the overall build cost (about 13% or more). For small jobs, this can be like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut (you don't want to spend \u00a310,000 on an architect when your budget's \u00a360,000, say). </p> <p>An architect is really of use when you have no idea how to design a space. You, however, sound as if you know what you want to do. A professional builder used to jobs on this scale should be able to work from your sketches. He'll deal with any structural issues and have plumbers, joiners, electricians, etc, who work with him. You want someone who comes with a recommendation, so visit a property he's recently worked on and talk to the owner. </p> <p>If the wall you're taking down is a serious structural element, you may need an engineer to design 'the steels', or supports, which will go in in its absence. But, again, the advice of a good builder is invaluable. </p> <p>As for your wish to be green, well, replacing your central heating is a good start because you'll upgrade to an efficient system with condensing boiler. If your flat is in the eaves, make sure the roof is well insulated, too.</p> <h2>Can we save our quarry tiles?</h2> <p><strong>The kitchen in our late-Victorian house has its original quarry-tiled floor - sadly covered by the </strong><strong>previous occupants' carpet and, under that, lino glued to the tiles. We'd love to restore them. Could we do it ourselves, or would we be better off calling in a professional?</strong></p> <p>Our DIY expert, Bridget Bodoano, says, 'It's a pretty big job, and messy, but it can be done. Nigel Frost of The Floor Restoration Company (01432 851138, <a href=\"http://www.floor-restoration.co.uk\">floor-restoration.co.uk</a>) says first remove the remnants of lino with a strong metal scraper, then the glue, much of which can be removed with a hot-air gun (about \u00a325, from DIY shops), which will loosen the glue. You'll need a number of scrapers and a fireproof container for the debris. Wear strong gloves (not plastic) and a chemical gas mask, because the fumes may be toxic. Ensure the room has plenty of ventilation and don't use near combustible materials. Remove any remaining glue with abrasive pads, plenty of clean cloths and, if necessary, cellulose thinners.</p> <p>Next, you may find you need to re-grout. Also, if any tiles need replacing, source them from reclamation and salvage yards. Last, scrub the floor, either by hand or machine; if there is still some residue on the surface, use a strong stripper such as Selate Floor Polish Stripper (\u00a35.50, 0845 226 7275, <a href=\"http://www.cleansave.co.uk\">cleansave.co.uk</a>).

  "<p>Jayne Fuller and Emily Sargent* were in senior creative positions in a magazine publishing house, but Fuller was going out with the boss. Sargent arrived, appearing glamorous, intelligent and altogether fabulous. Fuller felt ousted and threatened. </p> <p>\"I just couldn't cope with it. I felt so alienated,\" Fuller says. \"She was the one they all loved and would turn to because she was funny and clever, whereas I was the grumpy one who everyone hated.\" </p> <p>Sargent admits: \"Jayne was the most temperamental person in the office and people pussyfooted around her because she was going out with the boss and because she was the creative director with the licence to throw toys.\" </p> <p>Gather a group of people together, insist they spend large amounts of time in a confined space, then just sit back and watch human nature deal with the rest. The rules of Big Brother apply similarly to the office environment - still the standard backdrop of a regular working life - where we spend more time with strangers (initially) than we do with our friends and family.</p> <p>Hardly surprising, then, that disputes between colleagues are integral to office life. Disputes are the meat and drink of HR departments: whole reams of employment law are devoted to them, thousands of pounds are thrown at their desired resolution - and they drive people insane.</p> <p>But in the end, Fuller and Sargent sorted out the dispute themselves. Fuller says she woke up to the fact that things had to change when Sargent announced she intended to resign. </p> <p>\"It just hit me and I thought, 'this is insane.' So I just said to her that I was really sorry and I thought that all of the tension had been caused by the fact that I was extremely jealous of her.\" </p> <p>Sargent says Fuller's \"disarming honesty\" won her over. \"If it were not for the fact that one of the two conflicting parties shattered the wall of conflict I don't think it would have been resolved,\" says Sargent. Both are now firm friends, having left the company (and Fuller the relationship with her boss) some years ago.</p> <p>Realising that the current four-year-old system of statutory dismissal and grievance procedures is costly and unwieldy, the government will, from April 2009, replace it in favour of informal mediation - that unfashionable notion of getting people to talk to each other rather than dragging everything through the courts. In February Acas - a largely government-funded organisation - was given \u00a337m to help prevent workplace disputes unnecessarily going to employment tribunals. Acas is beefing up its advice helpline which, from next April, will point out to callers that they should try mediation as it may well be cheaper and better for all concerned. If they fail to heed this advice, Acas will conciliate at disputes that look set to become tribunals. </p> <p>\"By the time issues get to tribunals it's generally too late,\" says Mike Emmott, employee relations adviser at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development. The existing system of dispute resolution, he believes, requires all managers \"to play every conflict by the book, watch their backs and do things that would stand up in court rather than settle the case.\" Once statutory rights and employment tribunals are involved, protagonists are obliged to polarise their positions in order to win a legal settlement - not exactly an outcome conducive to mutual resolution. </p> <p>Emmott has just completed a how-to guide to workplace mediation, which typically involves a neutral third party or mediator bringing two opposing individuals together, encouraging them to air their views and then trying to find some mutual agreement. </p> <p>It's good news for private workplace mediators and there are already calls to introduce a system of accreditation. </p> <p>However, mediation is often tried too late, only after a formal grievance procedure has taken place rather than before, says Liz Hine, director of Mediation at Work. Hine recently mediated at a dispute between manager Amanda Edwards and housing support officer Jess Wilson* at a hostel for young homeless people. Wilson had already been subjected to disciplinary action which resulted in her suspension. </p> <p>The nub of the problem appeared to be a personality clash between two entirely different individuals. \"We're like chalk and cheese,\" explains Wilson. \"We've got very different working practices and I just didn't feel as if she liked me very much and I suppose that got my back up. We were locking horns and never got anything sorted out.\" </p> <p>Wilson didn't feel her suspension was warranted and thinks her manager, Edwards, was \"fed a lot of gossip from colleagues which wasn't necessarily true\". A protracted battle ensued which, in the end, they hammered out during a day of mediation. </p> <p>\"Mediation isn't going to change your whole personality,\" says Wilson, \"the problems are still going to be there, but it's about dealing with them.\" It did, however, give them a space to open up honestly, with Hine acting as an impartial referee. </p> <p>During mediation Edwards learned that Wilson wasn't the self-confident adversary she imagined. \"Although she appears confident she doesn't feel confident,\" Edwards says. \"We gained a better understanding of each other and I probably got a better insight into myself. One thing I learned is to nip something in the bud in the initial stages.\" </p> <p>For mediation to work, both parties need to be both honest and constructive. \"It can be quite difficult,\" says Wilson. \"Nobody likes criticism.\" She thinks a few more sessions would have helped them reflect and become a bit more open. \"But it has drawn a line in the sand. My relationship with Amanda is not as strained as it was.\" </p> <p>Although better, relations are still a little raw. \"I hope it settles down,\" says Edwards. \"I think sometimes we just need to get on with our work as opposed to being concerned about whether the person we have sat next to has offered to make us a cup of tea.\"</p> <p>Detective Chief Inspector Jackie Keddy, a Metropolitan police coach and mediator, agrees that in many cases, an honest conversation at the watercooler might avoid the march down to HR or the courts. \"In most places there are shelves full of policies and protocols but it can be a case of cracking a nut with a hammer,\" she says. \"I believe that organisations will be held accountable if they can't show that mediation has taken place and some tribunals might start to penalise them.\" </p> <p>A little DIY goes a long way, agree primary school teachers Nigel Cullen and Sarah Thompson* who fell out over sandwiches versus hot dogs at their school fete. According to Cullen, Thompson wanted the fete to be about maths. \"I wanted to have a hot dog stand and she insisted there wasn't any maths in that.\" </p> <p>Sandwiches were considered to have greater potential for the weighing and measuring of ingredients than hot dogs. \"The worst thing was, she said the kids should bake their own bread. I said, 'No, I'm not doing that.' So she went to the head, who agreed with her. We sold about two sandwiches, to staff who felt sympathetic.\" </p> <p>Eventually the two agreed to put the sandwich scenario behind them after agreeing to talk their differences through and resolve them - although Cullen insists he's going to do it his way next time.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Names have been changed</p>",
  "<p>UK taxi drivers aren't renowned for their music taste. Most exist on a diet of late-night commercial radio as smooth and familiar as the well-worn seats of a Y-reg Mondeo. When they're not ranting at TalkSport, that is. </p> <p>In South Africa, things are different. There, cab drivers are pivotal players in underground dance music. No, seriously.</p> <p>The young township poor are the main consumers of dance music, meaning there's no money in it, old folks hate it and mainstream radio and major labels have, historically, ignored it. Even kwaito, the popular Africanised take on US house, is sustained by independent labels, while its biggest star, Arthur Mafokate, still has records banned by the South African Broadcasting Corporation for using mildly rude Zulu slang.</p> <p>In this environment, where only 2% of households have broadband, the best way for aspiring producers to get their music heard is by giving cheap, unevenly-mastered CDs to taxi drivers and local \"tavern\" owners. The cab drivers, in turn, pride themselves on having the latest, hottest beats, and sell CDs to their passengers.</p> <p>This taxi-market has been crucial to the spread of local scenes like Pretoria house. Cultivated in Pretoria's townships, circa 2002, this mix of what Music Industry Online (<a href=\"http://www.mio.co.za\">mio.co.za</a>) calls \"catchy beats, non-stop rolling snare and simple sing-a-long vernacular vocals\" could be heard through the clubs and community radio stations. Now, however, one of its leading lights, - 23 year-old Elvis Maswanganyi, aka DJ Mujava - is about to go global. </p> <p>For years, Mujava (pronounced Mu-Java) was just another hungry producer, making beats on an unbranded Pentium II computer and hawking his CDs at Pretoria's taxi ranks and \"bashes\". Eventually he got so popular, taxi drivers would queue at his door. </p> <p>In 2006, however, his tough, hooky style (<a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/mujava\">myspace.com/mujava</a>) caught the ear of Johannesburg music company, Sheer, and Mujava's Township Funk track took off. It's reminiscent of early Sheffield bleep techno, although Mujava's big influence is actually Masters At Work. It sold 4,614 official copies (huge by SA standards) and became the New Year's Eve club anthem. </p> <p>Meanwhile, online, This Is Music, who manage Simian Mobile Disco, stumbled across a low-budget Township Funk video, which features friends from Mujava's township, Attridgeville, showing off their part-robotics, part-dancehall \"pantsula\" moves. They licensed it for UK release, and now this stark, brilliant track is everywhere, uniting DJs as diverse as Hot Chip, Sinden and, gulp, Judge Jules in appreciation. </p> <p>\"It's just amazing, I'm over-excited,\" laughs Mujava down a phone line from SA, where he's currently recording an album for Warp (who are releasing Township Funk internationally), and preparing to swap his regular Pretoria clubs, like Times Four and Homebase, for DJ gigs in New York and London. </p> <p>Let's hope he keeps up the guerrilla marketing at Heathrow. God knows Britain's cab drivers could do with the CDs.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Township Funk (This Is Music) is released September 15</p>",
  "<p>Closures (stoppers to you and me) keep wine in and harmful oxygen out, and corks have long been the closure of choice. They have come a long way since the 1600s, when French monk Dom P\u00e9rignon gave up on wooden stoppers wrapped in olive oil-soaked hemp, but the problem of corked wine (where the cork is contaminated, commonly with trichloroanisole, giving the wine a musty taste) has put buyers off. Modern technology has offered answers in the form of synthetic closures and screwcaps. Initially snubbed, these are growing in popularity: top wines are found with them, and 90% of NZ wines are now corkless. As well as limiting spoilage, screwcaps allow you to leave the corkscrew at home. Cork is fighting back, though - and it has eco-warriors, not to mention Jos\u00e9 Mourinho (face of the Portuguese Cork Association), on its side. Some studies have shown screwcap production to emit more carbon dioxide. Cork, meanwhile, is biodegradable, and cork forests are considered a vital lifeline for wildlife and protection against desertification. Plus some say wine ages better under cork. The choice, for now, is yours, but the WWF for one urges you not to \"screw\" the environment.</p>",
  "<p>As Google prepares to blow out the 10 candles on top of its birthday cake this Sunday, founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin can be forgiven for cracking a wry smile as they reflect upon the fire they have just lit under Microsoft.</p> <p>The conflagration that has the creator of Windows running for the fire extinguisher was caused by Google's launch of its own internet browser. The arrival of Chrome, announced in typically idiosyncratic style through the medium of an online comic strip this week, represents more than just a challenge to Microsoft's market-leading Internet Explorer. It represents a fundamental fight over the future of the computer.</p> <p>Microsoft, as so many potential rivals have found over the years, has a stranglehold over the market for the software that runs computers thanks to its hugely successful Windows operating system. So Google has taken heed of the old adage that if you cannot win, change the game.</p> <p>The rise of broadband internet access has finally created an environment where applications such as word processors or spreadsheet programs do not need to reside on a computer. Instead they can be run on the internet and the documents created can be stored on web servers so they can be accessed from anywhere a person can get online. In a world where such web-based applications abound, it does not matter what operating system a computer runs because all it needs to have is an internet browser and an internet connection. In that world, a user could even opt for a free operating system.</p> <p>It's a change that Bill Gates himself foresaw when 13 years ago he wrote an internal memo in which he assigned the \"highest level of importance\" to the internet and warned his colleagues that it was a potential \"tidal wave\" that could fundamentally alter the rules.</p> <p>That memo mentioned then market-leading browser Netscape as having the potential to \"commoditize the underlying operating system\". That infamous memo was one of the catalysts of the browser wars of the late 1990s, which ultimately saw Internet Explorer crush Netscape Navigator, and it also included a line about ensuring that makers of computers ship their machines with a Microsoft browser pre-installed. That practice landed Microsoft in court and led to the effective split of the company. But by then the damage was done and Netscape ended up in the hands of AOL before disappearing all but completely.</p> <p>When Gates testified as part of the anti-trust case brought against the company 10 years ago he was asked what that line about \"commoditizing the operating system\" had meant. He replied: \"They were creating a product that would either reduce the value or eliminate demand for the Windows operating system if they continued to improve it and we didn't keep improving our product.\"</p> <p><strong>Firefox cub</strong></p> <p>Ironically, Chrome, which has been roughly two years in the making, builds upon innovations made in browser technology by Microsoft's rival Mozilla, custodian of the Firefox browser, some of whose technological DNA comes from Netscape Navigator.</p> <p>But the browser wars of a decade ago do not live on just within the technology of Chrome, but in Google's decision to create it in the first place. The search engine's chief executive admitted after the launch that \"the browser wars of 10 years ago were right: the browser matters\".</p> <p>Brin added that \"operating systems are kind of an old way to think of the world. They have become kind of bulky ... We [web users] want a very lightweight, fast engine for running applications. The kind of things you want to have running standalone are shrinking.\" </p> <p>That is bad news for Microsoft, which makes a significant chunk of its revenues from its Windows operating system and Office suite of software, both of which sit upon the computer itself.</p> <p>Google, of course, makes pretty much all of its revenues from online search. It has gone from a doctoral project at Stanford University to the world's largest search engine in 10 years, blasting through the traditional media and advertising industries on the way. It is now one of the world's most trusted and recognised brands.</p> <p>Over the past few years, the company has moved into online applications and services such as email, word processing, calendars, instant messaging, maps, spreadsheets and even bought the online video phenomenon YouTube. </p> <p>But ultimately everything it does is about persuading people to do more with the internet. The more time people spend online, the more likely they are to search for something and the more likely they are to generate revenues for Google or queries that help improve its search algorithm. So why would it want to dabble with browsers?</p> <p>Firstly, the sense that Google's executives have given over the past few days is that if the rest of the industry had produced good enough browsers, there would have been no need for them to create Chrome.</p> <p>Announcing the launch of Chrome - which was leaked after a Google staffer posted a copy of the 38-page comic that heralded the move - the company said on its website: \"People are spending an increasing amount of time online, and they're doing things never imagined when the web first appeared about 15 years ago.</p> <p>\"We realised that the web had evolved from mainly simple text pages to rich, interactive applications and that we needed to completely rethink the browser. What we really needed was not just a browser, but also a modern platform for web pages and applications, and that's what we set out to build.\"</p> <p><strong>Android attack</strong></p> <p>Chrome, according to early testers, is certainly faster than many of the browsers already in the market - especially the current version of Internet Explorer - and it has been engineered so that if one website being visited freezes up, the entire program does not crash.</p> <p>Google has moved into another area - mobile phones - for roughly similar reasons. The creation of its Android operating system for mobile phones - the first device that runs it is expected in time for Christmas - owes much to the fact that the mobile internet has been promised for years but the industry's love of proprietary systems has held back its arrival. </p> <p>The first gadget to deliver on the promise of the mobile web, Apple's iPhone, owes some of its success to the fact that it is an \"open\" platform, so anyone who uses common web standards can create applications for it. Android is also an open mobile platform, in the same way as Chrome is an open browser platform.</p> <p>But Chrome is also a crucial defensive play for Google. If you rely - as it does - on people having access to the internet to make your money you not only want to make it as simple as possible but ensure no one gets in your way. </p> <p>The new, eighth version of Internet Explorer, which is due out soon, includes the ability to view web pages anonymously. Erasing a user's online footprints would make it harder for Google to collect the data about visitors that it uses to improve search results and serve relevant adverts.</p> <p>Chrome also has an anonymous browsing mode - which has quickly been dubbed \"porn mode\" because it hides details of where the user has been from other users of the same machine - but Google will still know what that user has been doing online.</p> <p>Then there is the fact that browsers increasingly contain search boxes within them, raising the risk that a popular new browser could slowly squeeze Chrome out of the market by signing up with a rival search engine.</p> <p>Google has already been hedging its bets. It has a deal with the Mozilla Foundation, a non-profit-making organisation that funds the development of Firefox, the web's second most popular browser, to have its search box within the browser itself. Just last month Google extended that deal - which has recently generated more than three quarters of Mozilla's revenues - until 2011. Google's toolbar is already standard on Apple's Safari browser and can also be downloaded and installed on Internet Explorer.</p> <p>Chrome has excited the tech world but ultimately it all comes down to money and for Google that means more people searching more often. As Citigroup put it in a note to clients this week: \"Given that search has become such a fundamental part of internet usage, anything that impacts overall internet usage is important for Google.\"</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p>Google is either more than 12, nearly 11, exactly 10 tomorrow or not quite 10 years old, depending on which event is taken as its birth. While still at Stanford University, Larry Page and Sergey Brin were working on technology that would become the forerunner of Google by <strong>January 1996</strong>. It was called <strong>BackRub</strong>, because it analysed back links - essentially the links to a site from other sites. </p> <p>BackRub was \"let loose\" in <strong>March 1996</strong>. Brin and Page had created an algorithm that ranked pages by importance - PageRank, which is still at the heart of Google today. The bigger the internet got, they reckoned, the bigger the search engine would get, which led them to name it after googol, the term for the numeral one followed by a hundred zeros. Google was launched in <strong>August 1996</strong></p> <p>Andy Bechtolsheim, one of the founders of Sun Microsystems, invested $100,000, making the cheque out to Google Inc, which did not exist. So on <strong>September 7 1998</strong> Brin and Page incorporated Google as a company.</p>",
  "<p>Our capricious British weather doesn't always lend itself to evenings in the garden, so it's no surprise that sales of patio heaters have rocketed in recent years. But as their impact on the environment has been realised (one hour of heating a 12.5kw model uses the same energy as making 400 cups of tea), the backlash has begun. B&amp;Q, the UK's largest seller of patio heaters, and the garden centre chains Notcutts and Wyevale have all agreed to stop stocking them. </p> <p>So what are the alternatives? Pile on extra layers and light a fire. An attractively designed fireplace will make a focal point in the garden, even when unlit; if you prefer something portable, go for a simple firepit or a cast-iron chiminea. </p> <p>As for fuel, use hardwood and charcoal that's sustainably managed and preferably produced locally, such as BioRegional Local Seasoned Firewood (\u00a33.98 for 10kg) and Charcoal (\u00a34.98 for 3kg) from B&amp;Q (0845 609 6688, <a href=\"http://www.diy.com\">diy.com</a>). Don't use treated wood, as it will give off toxic chemicals, and recycle the ash by digging into your borders once a year or mixing it into the compost bin.</p> <p>Stand the fireplace on a flat, non-combustible surface (ie not a wooden deck) and use a mesh guard if possible. Watch for sheds, fences and overhanging trees. Never use accelerants and keep children away.</p> <h2>Chimineas</h2> <p>Chimineas radiate heat from the neck as well as the opening - the bigger the opening, the easier it is to refill and cook with (most can be fitted with a grill). Smoke is drawn up through the neck, so these are the best fires for a windy day. They can have openings of 3m or more and weigh as much as 95kg, so you may need a wheeled trolley to move them. </p> <p>Clay chimineas originate from Mexico, where the Mayans used them as outdoor ovens for cooking and heating. They are easily cracked, so it's best not to move them around too much and don't expose them to extremes of temperature - cover or take in during winter, and fit a cap when not in use to stop water collecting inside. Insulate with sand or pea gravel; seal and season by making the first few fires small. You will get longer life from one reinforced with wire mesh.</p> <p>Cast-iron and cast-aluminium chimineas are the sturdiest and give off the greatest amount of heat - the sides can stay hot for some time after the fire has burned down. Cast-iron chimineas will rust unless kept dry, but are frost-proof and long-lasting. </p> <p><strong>Clay Reza Sol</strong> Large chiminea with sunburst motif and hanging candle which glows inside when fire is not in use.

They have an open design and generally a small diameter, so they give gentle heat rather than a big blaze, but they are quick and easy to get going, many are fitted with a pan to catch the ash and they can be used as a barbecue if burning charcoal or wood.

  "<p>As a way to lose friends and alienate people, promising cash handouts before cancelling them is hard to beat. Speculation that the prime minister planned to post cheques to families struggling with rising fuel bills has rumbled on all summer. In the middle of his vaunted economic relaunch, however, Mr Brown donned black tie on Thursday night to tell the Scottish CBI that there would be \"no short-term giveaways or gimmicks\".</p> <p>Bad luck has played its part in bringing the government to this seemingly disastrous pass. The rumours of payouts began when a top civil servant was overheard speaking on the train about how fuel bill relief might be administered. One reason why Mr Brown did not scotch the whispers more quickly is that he had hoped to raise the funds needed by charging electricity companies to pay more for pollution permits. The power regulator, Ofgem, had encouraged this belief, before it emerged that EU rules may preclude raising extra revenue in this way. Ineptitude, however, is also very much part of the story. Discussions with the energy companies about what they might do for poorer customers continue, and yet before they have concluded ministers such as the chancellor have all but surrendered their strongest remaining card, by appearing to rule out a windfall tax.</p> <p>Although the anticipated announcement on fuel bills on Thursday was postponed, some sort of an energy package is still pencilled in for next week. The talk yesterday was of a great push to help families insulate their homes - the environment secretary, Hilary Benn, said \"the really important thing\" [was] \"helping people to get those bills down for the long term\". That is all very well: lagging lofts is important, both to keep poor families warm and to reduce carbon emissions. The difficulty is that it cannot be done quickly enough to protect all those who will struggle to keep warm this winter now that average fuel bills are running at \u00a31,300 a year. The truth is that only a short-term fix can do the trick: the remaining hope is that the prime minister is hiding one up his sleeve.</p> <p>Mr Brown has not always resisted ad hoc giveaways - his winter fuel allowance ensures pensioners, at least, will get some relief. But that makes it even harder to justify not helping others who are suffering now. All the more so when new research yesterday showed that far from pouring all their bumper profits into investment, the energy giants paid out an extra \u00a3257m to shareholders last year. Mr Brown must now find a way to take a social dividend - or else find another means of cutting the heating bills. Unless he does, he will stand charged of having raised false hope, when the bleakest hour of winter arrives.</p>",
  "<p>The new movement in contemporary art is called democracy. Within the space of a few hours this week I heard half a dozen people speak in its favour. A woman at the big new Saatchi gallery, which opens in Chelsea next month, said the \"democratisation of contemporary art\" was one of two things that would sustain its popularity and value (the other is \"emerging markets\", meaning China, Russia, the Middle East, India, and the oil states of the former Soviet Union). The Saatchi gallery, she said, perfectly exemplified both: entry will be free and the opening exhibition, The Revolution Continues, is devoted to work that Charles Saatchi has acquired from Chinese artists. </p> <p>Then there is Damien Hirst. He and Sotheby's care very much about democracy. In the catalogue to the Hirst auction at the London saleroom later this month, the artist points out the cruel oppression of the regime we're up against. \"Well, the art world's totally not democratic,\" he says in an interview with writer Gordon Burn. \"You know, you walk in the gallery, you get put on the waiting list by an intimidating woman or something and they just want to know who you are ... They can be snobby and they can look down on you. It's very difficult to get a price.\"</p> <p>To the tumbrels, then, with these tyrant Camillas! Then into the formaldehyde! An end to the torture! Hirst's solution is to sell a large collection of his work directly to his customers, who merely have to raise their saleroom paddles often enough to get what they want. This weak-tea version of going to the barricades isn't quite unprecedented - Hirst sold the contents of his restaurant Pharmacy through Sotheby's in 2004 for \u00a311m - but it has raised a small storm of publicity, as it was intended to do. He talks of it, apparently seriously, as a brave and radical act: \"I think it takes a bit of courage, or madness, to get to the point where you just cut out the galleries and take a whole load of box-fresh pieces straight to market, no strings, highest bidder wins. Bang!\"</p> <p>Nobody thinks it can go badly wrong. So much money from so many interests have been invested in its success. Sotheby's and Hirst are both big brands, each using the other to extend their franchises (and in Hirst's case get more of the sale price by cutting out the large percentages taken by galleries). There have been small shows in New Delhi and Long Island to drum up interest. The sale catalogue comes in a beautiful boxed set of three volumes, an extravagant piece of publishing priced \u00a350. Sotheby's kindly sent me one free. Even unopened, the sight of it told me that \"democracy\" wasn't to be confused with \"equality\". Inside, this intimation was driven home by the estimates printed beside each object. The Golden Calf, the star of the show, is valued at between \u00a38m and \u00a312m; The Abyss (fag ends lined along shelves) at \u00a31.2m to \u00a31.8m. Very little was below \u00a3100,000 and it was hard to find what Sotheby's deputy director of contemporary art, Alex Branczik, described as \"entry-level\" pieces that a tyro (though not poor) collector might pick up for \u00a320,000. </p> <p>There are 287 lots in total, each dated 2008, which gives some idea of Hirst's production line. Another 200 earlier pieces are said to lie unsold in the White Cube gallery's warehouse. Too much Hirst? Sotheby's is gung-ho. Branczik said: \"I do genuinely believe we're experiencing a generational shift in taste - away from the chocolate-box Renoir and towards Warhol and Hockney and artists that remind people of their youth. Contemporary art is more accessible - easier to understand. With Damien, we're seeing interest from everywhere - new people are coming through the door at Sotheby's all the time.\" </p> <p>Five years ago Sotheby's in London counted 30 nationalities among buyers of work priced above \u00a3500,000. This year the figure is 60. Branczik said \"the amazing diversity and geographic reach\" of his clients would stave off the worst effects of the global belt-tightening that Britain will soon know as a recession. </p> <p>He may be right. Nobody knows. History suggests that art prices usually take 18 months or so before they follow the rest of the market down. The conventional wisdom is that sales to the super-rich - Roman Abramovich buying his Bacon and Freud - will remain immune. According to Cristina Ruiz of The Art Newspaper, changes are already being felt in what she called the middle-market, \"but, like with houses, anything above \u00a35m is fine.\" The strategy of the contemporary art dealer is to expand the market geographically (eastwards to \"emerging economies\") and socially (\"democratically\", to people who haven't bought new art before). The complicating factor is fashion - Hirst and Tracey Emin and all the rest need to go on being fashionable in Britain if they're to be taken seriously by buyers in India, which has developed its own Hirsts and Emins. And fashion, as an Alan Bennett character once remarked of sex, is a wayward monarch. </p> <p>The closest parallel to the boom in young British artists came in the last half of the 19th century with painters such as WP Frith, John Millais, Lawrence Alma-Tadema and Edward Burne-Jones (I owe this thought to another writer on The Art Newspaper, Melanie Gerlis). They were massively popular - fences sometimes had to be built around their pictures to hold back the crowds - and they sold for large sums, often larger than many of France's Impressionists made in their lifetimes. What happened next is starkly illustrated in the tables of Gerald Reitlinger's classic work, The Economics of Taste. Take Alma-Tadema's The Finding of Moses: sold for \u00a35,250 in 1904; for \u00a3861 in 1935; for \u00a3252 in 1960. Or Burne-Jones's Chant d'amour: sold for \u00a33,307 10s in 1886 and \u00a3620 in 1930. </p> <p>Most of these artists were spared the hurt by being dead by the time their reputations and prices collapsed, but the same wasn't true of the etching bubble of the 1920s, which impoverished etchers and collectors alike. The price of etchings soared before the first world war and went crazy after it. Critics marvelled that a picture reproduced in editions of 50 or 60, and therefore not a unique object, could cost so much - echoes here in Hirst's production line. Then Wall Street crashed. Etchings sold for \u00a3600 could be had for a tenner. Only today, and only sometimes, have they recovered their price. </p> <p>Could the same happen to contemporary British art? Recent sales figures for BMW (down 40%) and Aston Martin (down 67%) suggest even quite useful luxuries are taking a big hit. But many of the darker prognoses are coloured by a joy that a racket may get its come-uppance - with no suffering (unlike mortgage rates) incurred by the rest of us. Luke Johnson, the chairman of Channel 4, wrote in the Financial Times this week that \"just as the other asset classes have caved in during the past year, so the value of art must crash\". No part of the market was more vulnerable than contemporary art, much of which would \"end up in skips, worthless emblems of a period with too much liquidity and not much cultural judgment\".</p> <p>He has my vote, but a final call on the way the wind is blowing for contemporary art will need to wait for London's Frieze show in October and the Miami art fair in December. The results of Hirst's Sotheby's sale will be read carefully for their portents. In the catalogue, Gordon Burn points out that the risk of disaster is very small. Hirst replies, \"Yeah, but you know, everything goes for a lot of money until it doesn't.\" There speaks the Alma-Tadema of his generation.</p>",
  "<p>There is a striking similarity between Barack Obama and his new nemesis, Sarah Palin - and it's not just that they are both big on basketball. They have equally set out on what Obama likes to call an \"improbable journey\" that will see one of them make it all the way to the White House on November 4.</p> <p>In Palin's case, the improbable journey began here: a sprawling wooden compound that looks like a cross between an oversized McDonald's and a prison complex. It occupies a patch of barren ground on the edge of Wasilla, the tiny town in Alaska in which she spent her childhood and cut her political teeth. Above the entrance a banner announces that this is the home of the Wasilla Assembly of God, motto: \"To know Him, and to make Him known!\"</p> <p>It was here Palin was baptised, or \"saved\", as she describes it, and later had her children baptised. It was here she was inducted into the peculiar rituals of her fundamentalist faith - the charismatic preaching, the laying on of hands, the tears and cries of joy of the Pentecostal church. \"I grew up in the Wasilla Assembly of God,\" she once said. \"Nothing freaks me out about the worship service.\"</p> <p>On the night I visit the church, the congregation is huddled in a group, arms raised or clasped around each other, as the senior pastor, Ed Kalnins, leads them in prayer. \"Lord, we know that you have made this church a platform,\" he exclaims. \"You are using the wonderful Governor Palin to get your message of the gospel across.\"</p> <p>Pastor Ed, as his flock calls him, moved to Wasilla in 1999 - three years after the town elected Palin as its mayor. What struck him the first time they met, he has said, was that in her eyes religion came first, politics second. He thought to himself: \"This person loves Jesus. That's the bottom line. She loves Jesus with everything she has. She is a disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ before she is the mayor. Sarah Palin is the real deal.\"</p> <p>Pastor Ed's language may be colourful. But he has put his finger on a central truth about the woman who in two months' time could become the next vice-president of the US. From her earliest days at the bottom of the political ladder in minuscule Wasilla, through to her sudden rise this week into international stardom, she has always been on a mission.</p> <p>Her trajectory has run in parallel with that of her party. Her career took off precisely at the moment when the Christian right seized control of the Republican movement, casting out the fiscal conservatives who had traditionally held sway with their focus on such worldly matters as low taxes and small government.</p> <p>The shift in the party's focus from mammon to God is illustrated perfectly in Palin's successful campaign to become mayor in 1996. All previous elections had revolved around such existential questions as how to improve the pavements and get litter off the streets. She ignored all that, campaigning instead against abortion and gun control and casting aspersions on her (Republican) opponent about his infrequent attendance of church.</p> <p>Victoria Naegele was editor of the local paper, The Frontiersman, at the time and can recall the shock of the Palin revolution. \"I remember thinking 'Wow! Are religious issues really germane to the job of being mayor of a town of just 5,000 people?'\"</p> <p>Naegele remembers vividly too a second shockwave that came swiftly after Palin's election. Instead of easing her way into the role, she went in with guns blazing, demanding that six of the department heads of the council - none of them political appointments, several with many years' service - submit their resignations. When Naegele protested through the editorial columns of the paper at what she saw as the new mayor's heavy-handed style, she felt the heat. \"It was a difficult time. I was lambasted as a liberal, when in fact I am a Christian conservative Republican, just like Sarah Palin.\"</p> <p>Then, in an incident that is fast turning into the stuff of political legend, Palin was revealed earlier this week to have attempted to censor Wasilla's library. The idea is almost laughable when you see the library itself. Its small collection of books includes a prominent section on hunting and fishing, and no visible copies of Lady Chatterley's Lover. Yet in 1996, after parents complained about a book their child had taken home, Palin took umbrage. Frustratingly, no one can remember the volume concerned. What we do know is that Palin turned on the then librarian, Mary Ellen Emmons, asking her in a council meeting what she would do if she were told by the mayor to remove certain books from the collection.</p> <p>Local resident Anne Kilkenny was in the public gallery and heard the librarian's reaction: \"She sucked in her breath, and replied that the books in the library were all acquired in accordance with professional criteria and she would resist completely.\"</p> <p>Palin has since claimed her question was purely rhetorical. That is not how Naegele and Kilkenny perceived it at the time. A few weeks later, Palin sent Emmons a letter terminating her employment. \"People in the town rose up in anger,\" Kilkenny recalls. \"The library is an important institution in our city, as there's not a lot else to do here in the winter but sit by the fire with a good book. There was real public pressure, and Sarah was forced to rescind the letter.\"</p> <p>Emmons survived. Others were less fortunate. The museum director, city planner and public works director all quit within months of Palin's ascendancy, and the police chief was sacked outright (he sued for wrongful dismissal but lost). Palin said the turnover was needed to clean out the \"old boys' club\". Others were not so sure.</p> <p>Again, she was utterly in tune with the trajectory of her party. By the end of the 1990s the Republican leadership had adopted a modus operandi that also combined religious zealotry with managerial ruthlessness. Yet this development was not without its detractors within the party. One of the loudest critics was the very man who has put Palin on the national stage: John McCain. Paradoxically, it was partly his disdain for the grip that TV preachers came to hold over the Republicans that earned him a reputation as a maverick.</p> <p>Since then, Palin has travelled a huge distance in her journey towards the White House. Two years ago she became Alaska's first female governor, with some of the most valuable natural resources in the US under her control. Stylistically, she's become much more sophisticated. But under the surface, the way of operating has changed little.</p> <p>The religious mission is still front and centre of her politics. She opposes abortion in all cases other than those in which the mother would die if she were to give birth. She is a vocal opponent of gay marriage, and advocate of the teaching of anti-evolutionary creationism, or \"intelligent design\", in schools.</p> <p>Her religious beliefs extend to a conviction that the Iraq war is God's will. When she returned to Wasilla in June to pray with her old congregation, she said of the troops being posted to Iraq, including her own son, Track: \"Our national leaders are sending them out on a task from God. We have to pray there is a plan and that it's God's plan.\"</p> <p>Most poignantly, she will not countenance sex education for teenagers, preferring instead to preach that abstinence is the only complete protection against pregnancy or venereal disease. It would be a cheap shot to suggest that this week's bombshell revelation that her 17-year-old daughter, Bristol, is herself pregnant was Palin's comeuppance.</p> <p>But it would not be unfair to point out that Alaska has the highest per capita incidence of chlamydia in the country, and that the rate of teenage pregnancies across the US, including within her state, has just risen for the first time in 14 years - a trend many blame on George Bush's preferment of abstinence-only education. \"It's frustrating we aren't doing more to inform our children,\" said Brittany Goodnight of the Alaska branch of Planned Parenthood.</p> <p>If the religious flame still burns bright, so too does the ruthless determination. In an echo of what happened to the librarian and police chief in Wasilla all those years ago, Palin is embroiled in a full-scale investigation by the Alaskan state legislature into allegations that she sacked the safety commissioner because he in turn refused to act against a police officer whom Palin wanted dismissed. </p> <p>The officer, Mike Wooten, was the governor's former brother-in-law, who had been through an acrimonious divorce from her sister. Palin, her husband, Todd, and several of her aides tried to convince the commissioner, Walter Monegan, to fire Wooten, but he refused.</p> <p>The casualties scattered along Palin's path continue to mount. Lyda Green, a neighbour of Palin's in Wasilla, has just become the latest. She is stepping down as a state senator after 14 years.</p> <p>Green is the leader of the Republicans in the Alaskan senate and an old-style fiscal conservative. She voted against several of the governor's most important initiatives over the past two years, including a move to increase taxes on the big oil and gas companies. Green was surprised by the reprisals that followed. \"I found early on that if you disagreed with her it was not taken as a disagreement with policy, but a personal disagreement.\"</p> <p>First came the embarrassment of a radio interview between Palin and a local rightwing shock-jock in which the interviewer called Green a bitch and a cancer within the party. Palin's response on air? She laughed.</p> <p>\"She knew I'm a cancer survivor - she sent me flowers,\" Green says. \"That was a very lacklustre moment.\"</p> <p>Then Palin arranged for a friend to stand this summer against Green in the Republican party's selection process for her own senate seat. Green decided to stand down rather than go through a primary battle she was sure would be ugly. \"There came a point when I thought it was no longer worth it,\" says Green. \"I didn't need, in a community as small as this, to stand in the face of this very popular governor.\" Then she adds: \"But it's not a way to run a government.\"</p> <p>That's a pertinent observation, I suggest, in the light of the next destination Sarah Palin hopes to reach in her improbable journey. \"It is pertinent,\" Green replies.</p> <h2>Putin v Palin: who would win in a shoot-out?</h2> <p>American politicians have a long tradition of talking up their expertise with firearms. Most recently, then-hopeful presidential candidate Mitt Romney was caught boasting he'd \"been a hunter pretty much all my life\" - by which, it turned out, he meant he'd been rabbit shooting twice. But Sarah Palin's claim seems far more justifiable: a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association, she's been caribou hunting on numerous occasions, and footage exists of her firing an A4 assault rifle in Kuwait. She has also taken a close personal interest in \"aerial wolf gunning\", an Alaskan practice that involves exactly what you'd imagine.</p> <p>Vladimir Putin's recent tiger-tranquillising triumph, on the other hand, raises numerous questions. It wasn't caught on camera, even though he was with a TV crew, whose lives he reportedly saved, and footage that was released showed another member of the crew explaining how to hold the weapon. Firing a tranquilliser dart is easier, too: there's less kickback. Putin has been photographed brandishing a rifle in the past, but actual instances of shooting seem curiously absent.</p> <p>Gun enthusiasts swooned over Palin in the US, though some noted the rifle in the Kuwait video appears to be a modified one, equipped with a laser; you can't see the targets, but it's likely she was shooting at a simulator screen. Still, as one of the soldiers can be heard to observe, she's apparently \"hitting pretty close to dead centre\". </p> <p>This may not be the most persuasive foreign policy qualification in presidential history, but if Palin had to face Putin in a shoot-out on an ice floe in the Bering Strait, it seems likely she'd win. Unless Dick Cheney was hunting in the vicinity, of course, in which case he'd probably accidentally kill them both.</p>",
  "<p>A British student who was injured after falling off a horse in a remote part of Russia was rescued yesterday after sending a distress signal which was picked up 3,700 miles away by an RAF base in Scotland. </p> <p>Kimberley Warren, a second year zoology student at Nottingham University, activated a rescue beacon on Thursday night which was detected by satellites monitored by the UK Mission Control Centre, based within the Aeronautical Rescue Coordination Centre at RAF Kinloss in Moray.</p> <p>The beacon used GPS technology, which gives a very accurate position within five seconds of being activated, allowing RAF Kinloss to raise the alarm and tell Russian emergency services where to find the party of nine. </p> <p>\"They were able to pinpoint the location of the group right down to an area smaller than half a tennis court,\" said Michael Mulford, from RAF Kinloss, who added that it was \"very unusual\" for the base to respond to signals so far away.</p> <p>After a 12-hour helicopter rescue operation Warren, who had broken her leg, was airlifted to a nearby town with the rest of the group.</p> <p>The 20-year-old student from Sway, Hampshire, was nearing the end of a two-and-a-half month trip to research the effects of global warming on natural habitats in Kamchatka nature park, which is situated in a remote part of far eastern Russia, when the accident happened. </p> <p>Kamchatka is one of the world's last great wildernesses, home to the rare Steller's sea eagle, puffins, and brown bears, who roam around its geysers and snow-covered calderas - the term for a collapsed volcano. </p> <p>Kamchatka boasts more than 300 volcanoes, 29 of them still active. During Soviet times Kamchatka was a strategic military base, off limits to foreigners. But since the collapse of communism the 750-mile long peninsula has attracted conservationists and scientists - in addition to well-heeled foreign tourists, most of them German but including a few Britons.</p> <p>Russian officials said the rescue operation was hampered by bad weather. There are few roads outside Kamchatka's fog-covered capital Petropavlovsk-Kamchatky - with helicopters the only way of reaching most of the peninsula's central wilderness areas and national parks. Liz Warren, Kimberley's mother, said yesterday: \"Kimberley has had a fabulous time on this trip. From her emails we know it's been hard work, the field work has been tough, but she's loved every minute. As parents all we want to do is get her home and give her a big hug.\"</p> <p>Mulford said RAF Kinloss played a part in a distant rescue operation in December 2003 when Jennifer Murray, 63, from Somerset, and Colin Bodill, 54, from Nottingham, crashed in a helicopter in the Antarctic while attempting a round-the-world record via both poles. RAF Kinloss raised the alarm after picking up the signal from the helicopter's distress beacon.</p>",
  "<p>For Russia's leadership, it seemed everything had gone right. In three weeks, the country had invaded Georgia, crushed its military and defied international opinion by recognising the breakaway republics of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Western threats came to nothing. Russia's attack on Georgia went unpunished.</p> <p>But victory has been undermined by an alarming flight of capital. Analysts estimate that, since the war began on August 8, $19bn (\u00a310.7bn) has been withdrawn from the country.</p> <p>The Kremlin is also facing other economic problems. They include a rapid drop in the oil price, which has fallen almost 30% from peaks close to $150 a barrel, and a 9.7% increase in inflation since the start of the year.</p> <p>Analysts believe the war could become a catalyst for a more profound slowdown following at least seven years of unprecedented economic growth.</p> <p>So far the Kremlin has managed to unite Russians in support for the invasion of Georgia. But as the economy cools, the euphoria is wearing off.</p> <p>\"The war in Georgia has been the major driver of the whole thing. Officially capital flight has been $19bn. We estimate it could be $20bn-$25bn,\" said Vladimir Osakovsky, a Moscow-based analyst at UniCredit. </p> <p>\"For most of this year we were viewed as a safe haven. Capital was flowing into Russian markets and into Russian funds. We have lost this safe-haven sense.\"</p> <p>According to Osakovsky, the decline began not with the war in Georgia but in late July, when the prime minister, Vladimir Putin, launched an extraordinary attack on the mining and metals company Mechel. </p> <p>Mechel's share value plunged 38% on the New York stock exchange after Putin threatened to \"send doctors\" to examine its owner. Mechel shares lost $6bn in one day.</p> <p>Meanwhile, there is lively debate behind closed doors in the Kremlin. According to Andrei Piontkovsky, a researcher at the Russian Academy of Sciences, writing in the Moscow Times, Russia's political elite is split between the national and global kleptocrats.</p> <p>The global kleptocrats have invested most of their assets in the west, and are fearful that Russia's confrontation with Nato could escalate into a full-blown conflict. The national kleptocrats, by contrast, have stashed their billions inside Russia. They have less to lose should Russia try to repeat its military success in Georgia in other post-soviet states such as Estonia or Ukraine. </p> <p>It is no secret that Russia's elite send their children to English private schools, have houses in London's Mayfair and South Kensington, and enjoy skiing holidays in the French Alps. The EU has failed to find effective ways to persuade Russia to end its occupation of Georgia, but few doubt that the most devastating tactic would be to refuse Kremlin officials Schengen visas.</p> <p>\"It is becomingly increasingly difficult for them [the global kleptocrats] to explain why their wives and children are buying palaces in the capitals of countries that are supposedly Russia's sworn enemies,\" Piontkovsky wrote in the Moscow Times.</p> <p>Russian firms, meanwhile, are finding it harder to raise credit on international money markets. The Russian stock exchange has slumped to its lowest level for two years. </p> <p>And yesterday another 7.5% was wiped off shares as a result of the political crisis in neighbouring Ukraine, whose pro-western government has just collapsed.</p> <p>But as Neil Cooper of the Russo-British Chamber of Commerce points out, growth is still much higher than in Britain. \"If you compare it with what's going on at home, it doesn't look too bad,\" said Cooper. \"There is a slight slowdown [in Russia]. But nobody is immune to these reverberations around the world.\"</p> <p>He said growth rates in Russia were buoyant. \"The consensus is that Russia is still a place to be and a place to invest in. This is a land of opportunity,\" he said.</p> <p>Certainly Russia is well placed to ride out a financial crisis. Its oil-driven international reserves yesterday stood at $582.5bn, up a billion over the last week. </p> <p>President Dmitry Medvedev has shrugged off talk of capital flight and, in an interview on Tuesday, blamed recent problems on the US. \"It's 80% due to negative events in the US and 20% due to Georgia,\" he said. The US had to sort out its mortgage system and add liquidity to its financial markets, he added.</p> <p>When he became president in May, Medvedev was hailed as a new kind of leader - a reformist, a long-time fan of the British rock band Deep Purple, possibly even a liberal. After less than three months in the job, however, he has invaded Georgia, fallen out with the west and seemingly given up on early promises to end corruption.</p> <p>Although Russia's economy is expected to bounce back, it will take a long time for the country to recover its reputation as a risk-free investment destination.</p> <p>Asked to sum up the consequences of the war in Georgia for Russia's relations with the west, Grigorii Golosov, politics professor at the European University of St Petersburg, said: \"Pure deterioration.\"</p>",
  "<p>One of Britain's largest public transport businesses, Go-Ahead Group, admitted yesterday that it had been \"surprised\" by growing demand for rail and bus travel in the face of an economic slowdown.</p> <p>Britain's busiest rail operator said passenger numbers at its Southeastern and Southern franchises rose by more than 6% in the year to June, while bus passenger numbers outside London grew 4.9% in the three months to June. </p> <p>\"We were actually quite surprised,\" said Keith Ludeman, Go-Ahead's chief executive. \"As yet we have not seen any evidence of job losses percolating down to lower demand for tickets.\"</p> <p>Ludeman admitted that Go-Ahead had no firm evidence of what was behind the growing popularity of rail and bus travel - a phenomenon also being experienced by competitors including Stagecoach and FirstGroup. </p> <p>However, a recent dip in congestion on London's M25 ring road was cited by the Go-Ahead boss as an indication that high fuel costs are pricing motorists out of their vehicles. Ludeman added that other factors included a new concessionary fares scheme for the elderly, concerns over the environment and an influx of immigrants from eastern Europe who have chosen public transport over the car.</p> <p>Go-Ahead beat analysts' expectations yesterday by reporting an 8.8% increase in pre-tax profits to \u00a3103.1m, on revenues up 20% to \u00a32.2bn. Go-Ahead added that more than half the increase in operating profits, which had been buoyed by acquisitions and the gain of the London Midland franchise, was due to organic growth. </p> <p>Rail passenger growth is traditionally coupled with economic progress, but that link has weakened in recent years. The economy grew 3% last year but the number of rail journeys across the British network raced ahead by 8% to 1.2bn.</p> <p>Douglas McNeill, an analyst at Blue Oar Securities, warned that the latest Go-Ahead figures bore indications that demand for rail travel is slowing down, pointing out that the 6% growth at Southeastern and Southern was lower than the previous year.</p> <p>\"The catch lies in the outlook for rail usage,\" he said. \"There is a debate over whether growth will stay healthy or whether, on the other hand, it will fall towards a level more typical of previous years, when it was in line with GDP growth.\" He added that some of the factors that contributed to the popularity of public transport, such as congestion and environmental concerns, are expected to recede during a prolonged downturn.</p> <p>Ludeman also welcomed the announcement of above-inflation bus fare increases in London, where Go-Ahead also operates, saying that mayor Boris Johnson \"has had the courage to be honest about it\". He added that Go-Ahead's fares will also increase - in the case of its rail operations some could rise by between 6% and 8% - due to higher fuel and operating costs.</p> <p>\"We have to increase our prices. We are allowed to increase them up to a certain level and we will do that. It is good management to recognise that we have to recoup costs through price increases.\"</p>",
  "<p>It's known as the McDonald's theory of war, but has nothing to do with hand-to-hand combat over a bacon and egg McMuffin.

  "<p>Rising energy prices are on course to net the government a windfall of over \u00a31bn thanks to a little-known scheme designed to promote the development of renewable energy.</p> <p>The disclosure of the substantial sums made through the scheme comes as Gordon Brown has been piling pressure on power companies to plough some of the profits they have made through increased prices into helping cash-strapped consumers. </p> <p>The government has faced backbench calls to impose a windfall tax on energy firms and has been criticised for rejecting plans for a one-off cash payment to householders to help pay for steep increases in fuel bills.</p> <p>But after the Guardian revealed details of the government's own sizable profits through energy sales last night, there were calls for the windfall sums to be used to reduce householders' energy bills.</p> <p>The government profits come from a scheme set up in the 1980s to support renewable energy projects by guaranteeing to pay developers building wind, biomass and other non-fossil fuel generation plants a fixed price for their electricity for 15 years. </p> <p>During the first decade of the so-called Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation scheme, it ran at a loss, paid for by consumers, but over the last six years rising electricity prices have allowed the government to cash in on the energy contracts at a substantial profit. </p> <p>In total ministers have now taken payments of \u00a3585m out of the fund, and have another \u00a3218m in the scheme's account, which is held by the energy regulator, Ofgem. </p> <p>This year the scheme is expected to make \u00a3200m, or more than \u00a37 for every household in the UK. </p> <p>Last night Charles Hendry, the Conservative shadow energy minister, accused the government of using the scheme as a \"stealth tax\" and warned it would further damage public confidence in environmental measures. </p> <p>\"If you're going to tax environmental issues that money should be used for very specific projects for [the] environment, or else to help reduce taxes on families, but this seems to be going into a general pot,\" said Hendry. \"Certainly it would be in the spirit of it if the money was being used to deal with insulation and energy conservation.\"</p> <p>Energy companies have also complained about the government taking money which they feel should be paid back to customers or used to support new renewable energy.</p> <p>\"The money that's accumulated was collected with the purpose of achieving environmental ends, and in this regard particularly achieving renewable energy targets, so we think it should be used for that purpose,\" said Laura Schmidt, spokeswoman for the Association of Electricity Producers.</p> <p>The Renewable Energy Association said: \"That money is effectively raised for renewables and it isn't right it should be used not for renewables.\" </p> <p>The government is expected to announce a package of measures next week under which power companies will agree to help impove the energy efficiency of poorer households but it is likley to face difficult questions over why it is not using some of its own energy windfall to help the fuel poor. </p> <p>Ed Matthew, part of a powerful coalition of lobby groups which will publish a charter on fuel poverty on Monday, said the government's windfall should be spent on speeding up work to improve insulation in the poorest homes \"over and above\" what is already planned.</p> <p>\"This is a question of life and death: 20,000 to 40,000 people die every year because of cold in this country, and energy efficiency is the only permanent solution,\" said Matthew, head of UK climate for Friends of the Earth. \"Huge investment is required and the money has to come partly from companies and it has to come directly from government itself if we're going to get anywhere close to the kind of investment required to solve the problem.\"</p>",
  "<p>The leader of Britain's largest union, Tony Woodley, has accused Gordon Brown of \"betrayal\" after the prime minister appeared to rule out additional help for families struggling with energy bills. </p> <p>MPs yesterday joined the Unite leader in condemning the prime minister for using a speech on Thursday night to signal next week's long-awaited energy plan would not include \"gimmicks or giveaways\", such as one-off payments. Labour MP Fabian Hamilton said he was \"very sad\" to hear Brown describe one-off payments as \"gimmicks\". </p> <p>The government has said it aims to reduce bills through encouraging greater household energy efficiency but Woodley, whose union has 2 million members, said the government needed to do more than \"lagging the loft\". He said: \"We need to legislate to cap these price rises from these greedy utilities so that we help the ordinary family in our country. If we don't do that then we would have betrayed our people and ... our country.\"</p> <p>The environment secretary, Hilary Benn, insisted the government had not caved in to the energy companies and the negotiations were work in progress. </p> <p>He said long-term measures like insulation would cut bills permanently by about \u00a3100 a year.</p> <p>The government says energy companies are already spending \u00a32.8bn over the next three years to help people reduce their bills through carbon emissions reduction target programmes (Cert).</p> <p>A government spokesman yesterday confirmed that one programme - the Warm Front - had had its funding cut by \u00a350m in the last year but said that a larger portion of Cert was now allocated to vulnerable households. </p> <p>Research by the Local Government Association shows that energy companies do not spend as much on long-term investment as they have claimed.</p> <p>The companies say they divert their huge profits into long-term investment but the LGA says the six largest suppliers increased their shareholder dividend payouts by 19% last year to \u00a31.64bn. </p> <p>The signal that a one-off payment is off the agenda will add momentum to the campaign led by the leftwing group Compass for a windfall tax. Yesterday it said the number of MPs who had signed its petition had risen to 122, and the issue will be put to a vote at the Labour conference.</p> <p>Officially the government has not ruled out a windfall tax. But ministers worry that this could backfire, because the cost could be passed on to customers.</p> <p>This week was the first of the government's autumn relaunch, but yesterday a poll by the Independent showed that Tony Blair is the only senior party figure who would transform Labour's prospects at the next election.</p> <p>ComRes found that Blair as leader would almost halve the Conservative party's poll lead from 19 to 10 points and cut the Tories projected majority of 182 seats to just 20. </p> <p>The poll also showed that none of Labour's potential leadership challengers fared any better than Brown.</p>",
  "<p>\"Chocolate\" to chardonnay's \"vanilla\", cabernet sauvignon ripens later than the white grape and so tends to be planted in warmer areas. The wine it produces has a powerful aroma of blackcurrant wherever it is grown and, if matured in newish oak, can smell of cedar, cigar boxes and, sometimes, tobacco. It is also notable for being deep purple in youth and, while not especially alcoholic, it can be very long-lived. This is because the small, thick-skinned grapes have a very high ratio of solids rich in colouring matter and tannins to juice. If the grapes are anything less than fully ripe, however, the wine can smell of crushed green leaves - \"herbaceous\". This means cabernet can make great wine, but it is not necessarily the best grape for wines to be drunk young, particularly when grown in cooler climates.</p> <p><strong>France</strong></p> <p>Contrary to popular belief, cabernet sauvignon is not Bordeaux's most planted vine. Because it is relatively late ripening, it ideally needs a warmer, drier environment than much of Bordeaux can provide. It is therefore most important in the well-drained gravels of the mild M\u00e9doc and Graves - on Bordeaux's left bank - where it is invariably the chief constituent of wines, but always blended with merlot, cabernet franc and sometimes with petit verdot. </p> <p>In the M\u00e9doc, it is the main varietal component in St Est\u00e8phe wines, which are taut and austere in youth (though they are getting more welcoming with every vintage); in the dense, mineral-scented Pauillacs; in many a lush, silky Margaux; and in the beautifully balanced yet long-lived St Juliens. </p> <p>Cabernet sauvignon brings crispness and long life to the wines of Graves, and the suggestion of warm bricks common to several from Pessac-L\u00e9ognan. It is planted all round greater Bordeaux in the appellations that make up France's south-west region, and is out-tannined only by the tannat grape of Madiran. Bergerac and Buzet are its chief strongholds. </p> <p>Elsewhere in France, it is grown in the Loire (where cabernet franc is much easier to ripen), but most of the rest is in the south. In Provence, it can blend beautifully with the spicier syrah to make ambitious, oak-aged wines for the long term. In the Languedoc, it is all too often underripe and yields rather lean, hollow vins de pays, although there are exceptions.</p> <p><strong>North America</strong></p> <p>California, particularly its northern regions, has made some intense cabernets with great skill, arguably proving itself the grape's second home. Much of the Napa Valley seems particularly well suited to it, and this will continue to be one of the world's most fruitful hunting grounds for lovers of super-ripe cabernet. Blends made according to the Bordeaux recipe are often called meritage here. Washington's merlot is generally more successful than its cabernet sauvignon, but there are some appetising exceptions.</p> <p><strong>South America</strong></p> <p>Cabernet cuttings were taken to South America long before the phylloxera pest struck in Europe over a century ago, and Chile's wine industry was built on this variety. In fact, its largest firm, Concha y Toro, has claimed to be the world's most important owner of a \"cab sav\" vineyard. Most Chilean cabernet is still ungrafted (in Europe, vines were grafted on to a more resistant species from North America to beat phylloxera), and has a very direct, fruity flavour, without the mintiness associated with parts of California and Australia.</p> <p><strong>Australia</strong></p> <p>Australia defined its perfect spot for cabernet sauvignon before any other variety: Coonawarra, in the far south-east of South Australia, on a small and hotly disputed strip of terra rossa earth. These wines tend to have a high level of acidity as well as some notes of eucalyptus. Margaret River in Western Australia can also make great, refined, more complex cabernet, and there are fine examples all over Victoria as well as in the Hunter Valley and elsewhere. In Australia, cabernet is often blended with the much richer, fleshier shiraz.</p> <p><strong>Italy</strong></p> <p>Cabernet sauvignon has made some of Italy's most ambitious wines, notably \"Supertuscans\", in which it is sometimes blended with sangiovese. In the Maremma on the Tuscan coast, a host of estates have followed the example of Sassicaia, one of the first Italian reds made in the image of fine red Bordeaux. There are also bottlings from as far afield as Piedmont and Sicily. Bottles from the north-east described simply as \"cabernet\" almost certainly contain cabernet franc, and sometimes carmen\u00e8re, rather than cabernet sauvignon.<br><strong><br>Elsewhere</strong></p> <p>While cabernet sauvignon is relatively rare in Spain and Portugal, it is planted widely in central Europe and does well in the warmer Mediterranean regions, notably Lebanon and Israel. Cape winemakers have tended to make 100% cabernets, unsoftened by merlot or leavened by cabernet franc. New Zealand's best examples are grown in the relatively warm Hawke's Bay region and on Waiheke Island. While cabernet sauvignon has shown some satisfying regional variations, in many parts its slow evolution is being re-evaluated, often to the benefit of other, fleshier red varieties. It may be that, in a decade or two, cabernet will be more exclusively the preserve of the world's most ambitious winemakers.</p> <h2>Victoria Moore recommends</h2> <p><strong>One to drink now</strong></p> <p><strong>Sainsbury's Taste the Difference Coonawarra Cabernet Sauvignon 2006, Australia</strong><br><strong>\u00a37.99, Sainsbury's</strong></p> <p>Made for Sainsbury's by Katnook, this exhibits classic Coonawarra style: dusty blackcurrants and a faint menthol tinge.

  "<p>She is an ordinary dog. A leg at each of her four corners. An inquisitive nose, which she thrusts into everything - the more disgusting the pile, the better. Bright, button-brown eyes. Two feathered flops for ears. This is Muffin. A spaniel-collie cross- in other words, a bog-standard mongrel. I make no special claims for her. But her role in my life, and in that of my daughter and late husband, Tim, has been crucial. People who do not like animals will never understand her story of canine valour. Others will find it laughingly obvious. Nonetheless, it impresses me: the power of companionship, the pivotal support one small dog can provide. In life, in sickness - and after death. They should put Muffin and her ilk on the NHS: she's better than Prozac and a good deal cheaper. </p> <p>She has been with us nearly nine years now, and it has not been an easy journey, for the dog or her human companions. But definitely worth it. In December 1999, I decided our family needed a pet. We had two goldfish but they were hardly interactive. Our daughter, Molly, was seven - and the initial thrill of the fishes' arrival had long since worn off. But as we started to face up to the reality of Tim's recently confirmed terminal cancer, we all needed a little joy and a bit of bounce in our lives. So I suggested a rescue dog.</p> <p>So far, so good. Off we all went to the RSPCA in central Leeds. I had visions of a gruelling prison visit but it wasn't like that at all. We sat in the waiting room and leafed through a brochure with a write-up of each dog. Then we picked three possibles and they were introduced to us, one by one. All most civilised.</p> <p>The first one - big, blonde and rather smelly - immediately knocked Molly over, ruling herself out at the first strike. The second - a hairy mop on legs - was overexcited and slobbery. The third was a scrawny bag of bones with a scurvy-like skin condition and a sad string for a tail hanging down between her legs. She was an anxious and darting individual. Black and tan and the smallest of the bunch. Curiously, it was Tim - an imposing 6ft 5in - at whom she first launched herself. They say the dog chooses you, rather than the other way round. And she had made her choice. This was Muffin - or rather Sonia, as the RSPCA rather ludicrously called her. </p> <p>Frankly, I was not impressed by any of the three specimens, but both Tim and Molly preferred Sonia. It was intriguing that I had clearly missed something when I met this dog - something that had conveyed itself to both husband and daughter. So I decided to have another look at her, in secret, on my own, just to be sure.</p> <p>The RSPCA allows you to walk your chosen candidate under strictly controlled conditions. I took the little dog up the road from the shelter - a soulless, inner city stretch of tarmac - until I found a scrub of green littered with a few reluctant trees. It was a windy winter's day. There were a few dead leaves swirling around and a good deal of litter. Sonia, who had walked like a robot in front of me all the way, suddenly had a change of character. She stopped dead having spotted a flying leaf and gave chase, in a quick and mad little circle of delight, lips curled back in an unlikely grin. This creature, until now an unattractive collection of troubles and needs, was giving me a glimpse of something else. Character. A sense of humour. Life. That was it. The dog was saved - or, rather, saved herself - and I was sold. </p> <p>Of course, I had to confess my secret mission to the two back home. After a family summit meeting, we decided to adopt her. Sonia came home with us a couple of weeks later. She was re-named Muffin: double chocolate chip. Her life was transformed - and so was ours.</p> <p>The next bit was tricky. Muffin was wild and woebegone. She had no concept of indoors and outdoors, no rhythm or routine to her life, no notion of where she ended and the rest of the world began. She ate erratically and pooed prodigiously - mostly on the carpet at the foot of the stairs or outside people's bedrooms, as if making some kind of scatological sacrifice to her new masters. </p> <p>Although Tim loved dogs and had always longed for one of his own, he was a fastidious man and found all this mess unbearable. One morning, I found him halfway down the stairs, dog muck on his bare foot, bellowing at Muffin, who cowered beneath him by the front door, awestruck by his size and the overpowering volume of his voice. Tim was a quiet man. This outburst was uncharacteristic in the extreme. I had to step between the two of them and calm things down. This was the week before Christmas. The house was in turmoil.</p> <p>Tim may have had doubts about Muffin but she had none about him. As with most of the humans who knew him, she regarded my (normally) gentle giant of a husband with a mixture of tenderness and awe and picked him as pack leader from the second she clapped eyes on him. Soon she became responsive, house-trained, devoted. He, in turn, learned to relax, and their bond was fixed for life - not the dog's, but the man's. They became an inseparable duo. </p> <p>By the end of her first year with us, Muffin was thriving. Her tail, always an accurate barometer of canine wellbeing, metamorphosed from a piece of matted old rope to a waving, feathery plume. She put on weight. Her eyes sparkled. Her star was rising.</p> <p>Tim, meanwhile, was getting sicker. In 2000, he started to work from home. Over the next three years he suffered a multitude of symptoms, due both to the cancer and the heavy medication used to control it. At first, he was still mobile, although he tired easily. He took the dog for long walks in the local wood. They played together - elaborate and interminable chase games with sticks and balls that exhausted them both and bored everybody else, but made them happy. </p> <p>Later, when he was too weak to walk, Muffin lay at his feet and slept. When he vomited, she sometimes retched in sympathy. When he was in pain, she was a silent, sympathetic witness. In her role as companion - even some kind of simple soul mate - she never flinched.</p> <p>In autumn 2003, Tim was admitted to the local hospice and died there in January 2004. Muffin was a frequent and honoured visitor. She was with us, on our last visit to see him, the night before he died. As we left, I took his left hand and placed it under the dog's muzzle. She gave one discreet lick farewell. Like him, she was dignified, accepting.</p> <p>Denial and disbelief at a death are not confined to humans. Muffin looked for Tim constantly in the following days. Every time Molly and I came home in the car she would welcome and count us in at the door, one ... two ... and then run to the passenger door, tail waving high, for number three. </p> <p>But, unlike humans, who find it easy to become mired in grief and hard to move forwards, dogs are pragmatic creatures. The love she had for Tim was quietly and quickly transferred to Molly and myself. She still had a big job to do and became the willing receptacle for all the tense and sorrowful emotions that a bereavement brings in its wake. She became exceptionally alert to distress - knew, from the quality of a walk down the stairs, from a fluttering of the hands, that tears were coming - and was there, like a shot, lying gently at the sufferer's feet, waiting for the storm to erupt, and willing it to quickly subside.</p> <p>Four years on, a different, calmer life is established. Muffin relies on me for all practical considerations. For my daughter she reserves a special devotion - and a great sense of silliness and play. Her role in our small family is integral and much appreciated. She has formed a character as big and bountiful as the problems she presented when she first came.</p> <p>But Muffin is certainly no saintly dog. She has no special powers. She is hairy, messy, noisy when visitors arrive, sulky when ignored and capricious with her appetites. There is a \"princess\" streak in her as pronounced as her skills in nursing and psychotherapy. Her strong attachment to us makes spontaneous trips away very difficult. She is a tie, no question. I grumble at her all the time: she glares back. Neither of us deserves a halo. Both of us, however, accept the mutual dependence.</p> <p>The British are famous for their supposed devotion to their dogs and we do love to assign recognisable human emotions to the species with which we have perhaps the closest bond. I am guilty of this, too. Muffin, I feel certain, is such a gifted individual. In those brown eyes reside - surely - such depths of intelligence and wisdom?</p> <p>In essence, of course, what she does so well is just to be herself: a dog. Our family pet. We miss the point when we ascribe too many of our own feelings to the dogs we own. They do not so much enter our emotional territory as simply share it and reflect it back to us, without judgment or blame. It is that atmosphere of acceptance - of wordless cheer - that is so deeply comforting, even transforming. This is the dog's gift to us.</p> <p>Muffin is 11 now. She is getting a little creaky around the edges: her back end is going slightly, there are white whiskers on her muzzle. Still, she is playful. Still, life is fun. Always there is good faith between us. Loyalty and deep affection. That was the deal. We rescued her, then she rescued us. It is a nice example of the symmetry between animal and human and of a certain, special kind of compassion.</p>",
  "<p>Martin Corry starts his final season as a player with no idea what he will do when he peels off his Leicester jersey for the last time. He is adamant, though, that he will not be following his former England and Tigers' team-mate Austin Healey on to Strictly Come Dancing.</p> <p>\"I will never appear on that show,\" said Corry. \"It may be big money, but with that comes big embarrassment. I saw Austin the other day and we had a 30-minute conversation about the finer points of ballroom dancing and the technical difference between the tango and the jive. I left wondering how, after training my guts off and sweating, I could end up talking about that. I look forward to playing a game, going home, cracking open a beer and watching Austin on television. That's as far as it will go for me.\"</p> <p>Corry, who won 64 England caps and appeared in six Tests for the Lions, is one of the last of a dying breed in the Premiership, a player who made his debut in the amateur era. He started at Newcastle Gosforth, as the Falcons were then called, before moving to Bristol in the summer that the game turned professional. He captained the club before joining Leicester in 1997 and, turning 35 next month, his 14th season will be his last.</p> <p>\"I don't want to think about what I will do when my career as a player is over,\" said Corry. \"I can't leave the game I love, but should I take some time out before coming back or start coaching at under-eight level? I will have to do something outside rugby and have had some work experience in recent years, but I've had a 10-out-of-10 job for the last 14 years and it would be difficult going to one where you did not love all of it. I'm greedy and want to have it all. I guess I am in a state of denial. I am not looking at it as my final season.\"</p> <p>Leicester's Premiership campaign opens tomorrow at Gloucester, the scene of their play-off victory last May on an afternoon which was a triumph for Leicester grit and determination after being outplayed for long periods. The Tigers finished the season empty-handed, sacked their head coach Marcelo Loffreda and lost Neil Back to Leeds before appointing the South African Heyneke Meyer to take over.</p> <p>\"We had bloody-mindedness at Gloucester in the play-off but very little else,\" said Corry, who will be absent tomorrow because of a groin strain. \"The result was all-important, but I would like to think we have developed as a team and can play a lot more rugby. There were reasons, excuses and false reasons for what happened last season. It is hard to distinguish between all of them, but we are a club that wants to set the mark across the board. Everyone was responsible for our failure last year: we have left it behind and learned from it.</p> <p>\"Heyneke has brought a buzz with him. He may come from a different environment, but he can relate to the Leicester culture and he appreciates the values we have. He wants us to expand and develop a different skill-set. He wants to add to the Leicester spirit, not dilute it - and you have to get it spot-on in the Premiership because there is no weak side.\"</p> <p>Corry retired from international rugby after last season's World Cup. He was part of the squad in Australia in 2003 which lifted the Webb Ellis Trophy, and although failure quickly followed, he was one of the few England players who enhanced his reputation. While not relishing the day when he will be known as an ex-player, he is concerned at the impact the experimental law variations will have on the game.</p> <p>\"It is going to take a month for referees and players to know where they stand,\" said Corry. \"No one wants to see a game where there is a penalty or a free-kick at every breakdown. Penalties are potentially game-winning or -losing and should not be awarded lightly. The fine-tuning variations I can take, but it is the big changes - the lineout, the pulling down of the maul and the directives on the tackle - that are going to have a major influence on the game and I fear they will lead to a lot more kicking. Is that what the rules are designed to achieve?\"</p>",
  "<p>A mere three months after it started - that's a quarter of a year - Big Brother 9 draws to a close tonight. Five housemates are duking it out for the \u00a3100,000 prize. Who'll get their grubby mitts on it? We'll find out from <strong>8pm</strong> tonight. </p> <p>Will it be <strong>Darnell</strong>? He has some serious self-esteem issues and has spent much of his time in Elstree demanding respect, mostly through the medium of a skanky blue hooded sweatshirt's logo. He's also tried to get off with Bex, who preferred Luke, and Sara, who preferred Stuart, and when rejected he resorts to flinging bitter misogynist insults.</p> <p>Will it be <strong>Sara</strong> herself, then? She's pretty (despite what Darnell, Rex and Mo have told her), she's sunny, and she's occasionally intentionally amusing. However, she'd be much easier to like if she got herself a semblance of a spine and stood up to the nasty boy bullies rather than flirting with Darnell and letting him grope her simply for a quiet life.</p> <p>Will it be <strong>Mikey</strong>? His incessant shouting and appalling table manners must be difficult to live with, but he's straight down the line and is moderately entertaining.</p> <p>Will it be <strong>Rachel</strong>? The worst things anyone's ever said about her are that she's relentlessly optimistic and doesn't like arguments. The contrast of her Disney princess ways with the bubbly outspoken minx portrayed in her audition VT has led to accusations of \"falseness\", but her sweet-natured ways, day in day out, seem to be the real her - but is she too bland for the viewers' votes?</p> <p>Or will it be <strong>Rex</strong>? The hate figure of the OG liveblog squad, the executive chef claims to have worked his way up from the bottom (in Daddy's restaurant). Then again, he also claims to love his girlfriend <strong>Nicole</strong> (whom he bullied relentlessly in her short time in the house). He's been arrogant, domineering, vicious and thoroughly unpleasant, and yet he's never been up for eviction.</p> <p>Let us take a moment now, though, to remember those who have already gone, and who'll be making their unwelcome return to our screens this evening. <strong>Kat</strong> and <strong>Mo</strong> only went <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/organgrinder/2008/09/big_brother_9_the_10th_and_11t.html\">three days ago</a>, so you won't have forgotten them already, no matter how hard you may have tried. It's unlikely that <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/organgrinder/2008/06/post_69.html\"><strong>Alex</strong></a> or <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/organgrinder/2008/06/post_73.html\"><strong>Dennis</strong></a> will be there, but we'll have the gruesome twosome of twosomes - <strong>Lisa and Mario</strong>, and <strong>Bex and Luke</strong>. Blink-and-you'll-miss-her <strong>Stephanie</strong> will be back; so will <strong>Sylvia</strong>; and house heart-throbs <strong>Dale</strong> and <strong>Stuart</strong> will jog on to the podium in all their finely-muscled glory. Fresh from her magazine appearances, we'll see the house's very own expressionist painter <strong>Jen</strong>, and, if she can spare the time from living life on the edge, <strong>Maysoon</strong>. Add to that <strong>Belinda Belinda Belinda</strong>, and I think that's the lot.</p> <p>TheNuclearOption reminds me that Rex was up for eviction in Week 4 (all those years ago) - how on earth has he not been nominated (in a proper sense) since? I continue to have my reservations about the way the nominations process has been manipulated (what with the head of house nonsense, the heaven and hell thing, the random new housemates) but even so - what do the people inside that Borehamwood compound see in him that simply doesn't translate on screen? And more frighteningly, if the <a href=\"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/view/48775/Rex-and-Nicole-get-TV-show/\">rumours</a> are to be believed, what do Endemol see in him?</p> <p>Incidentally I was Googling for that story, and found <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-488991/Smoke--cigarette-thats-legal-indoors.html\">this</a>. Let's laugh at Nicole's ludicrous shirt-dress.</p> <p><strong>8pm</strong>: Whoop! Here we go! Davina, wearing an off-the-shoulder sparkly shower curtain, welcomes us to a \"five-nation finale\" - oh, girlfriend, you did NOT play <a href=\"http://thebitchfactor.blogspot.com\">The X-Factor</a> card.</p> <p><strong>8.03pm</strong>: The ex-housemates arrive, to a cacophony of booing. Steph (looking beautiful), Sylvia (looking beautiful), Jen (looking bedraggled and wearing a meringue), Mario, Belinda, Bex (in animal print, with her bosom falling out), Maysoon, Luke (looking like he's stepped out of the cast of Bugsy Malone), Dale (who isn't going out with Jen any more, he says, looking embarrassed), Stuart (looking skinny), Nicole (who still loves Rex, the fool), Lisa (in leopard print and leather), Mo and Kat.</p> <p>Then it's off to a break, after which the first vote-count will be taken, and the fifth-placed housemate will be booted out.</p> <p><strong>8.10pm</strong>: We're back after the break, and it's time for some highlights from the penultimate day. Darnell makes a big fuss about a wasp flying near him, meaning that he runs away, leaving Rex and Sara sitting alone in the ashtray. Rex tells Sara, \"You two are so going to get it on.\" She looks unconvinced, but admits, \"I am really warming to him lately.\" Lately? You mean, since he stopped calling you a slag and an ugly bitch?</p> <p>Mikey is monologuing about being able to \"watch Big Brother while you're on Big Brother\", which I'm sure sounds very profound in his head, but sounds ludicrous when broadcast.</p> <p>First screamed obscenity of the evening from me to the television - as Rex, at the dining table with his colleagues, toasts his father for moulding him into the very nice young man that he is, which explains why he's never been evicted. In the meantime, Darnell is rocking back and forth in his chair with a big cotton wool eyepatch. He is, of course, wearing the obligatory skanky blue sweatshirt. When it comes to his turn to speak, he witters on about not labelling people and the need to respect them. I'd say that would have been a good time to apologise to those he's labelled, but hey ho.</p> <p>Rex has silver shoes, the like of which are usually only seen on Strictly Come Dancing, and sulking about only having one bottle of booze between the five of them. Everyone else is bopping around to Beyonce's Crazy in Love, and Rachel and Sara are singing along as best they can, bearing in mind they only know the title. Then the music changes to Whitney's I Will Always Love You, and Rachel and Sara wail along. Rex doesn't want to get up and dance with the others, but he still feels that he has the right to tell them not to sing, the moody child. As the song goes on, he realises that he does, in fact, want to join in, so gets up, looking reluctant, but then breaks into a broad beam and sings and sways along. He looks like a different person when he smiles genuinely, as opposed to that nasty snide smirk he usually does.</p> <p><strong>8.22pm</strong>: Davina talks to the house! And the person finishing in fifth place is - <strong>Darnell</strong>! He walks out squinting into the flashbulb-lit rain in his hoodie and a white gypsy skirt, riding a pony (not a real one), and picks Davina up. He doesn't throw her into the crowd for a spot of Stuart-style crowd-surfing, though.</p> <p><strong>8.29pm</strong>: Back after the break for some inquisition. Davina takes a hardline feminist stance and rips Darnell to shreds for his bullying and casual sexism and woman-hating, asking if he's ever considered therapy for his ingrained Madonna/whore complex. No, I'm totally kidding. She asks him how he feels; \"I've never felt this much love in my whole life,\" he says. \"The housemates told me you're a stunning, amazing, beautiful woman...hot damn!\" We get a montage of Darnell being miserable, because we've not had enough of that over the last 12 weeks. He gets a hug from Davina, who asks if he will love himself if enough people show him love, and he agrees. She goes on to mention Sara briefly, and she's booed horrifically. \"I'm just a cuddly kind of person,\" he claims. \"We're really good friends.\" Davina tries to draw him on his actions when he was \"Bad Darnell\", by which she presumably means when he was a thoroughly hideous, jealous piece of work. \"I am the man, I have to take responsibility for the things I do,\" he proclaims, in utter contrast to anything we've ever seen him do ever.</p> <p>Montage of Darnell's best moments in the house, and then he grabs the mic to thank the country for welcoming him so warmly. He's proud to call the UK home. And we're proud to have him, right?</p> <p><strong>8.37pm</strong>: Davina talks to the house again. The person finishing in fourth place is - <strong>Rex</strong>! HOORAY! WELL DONE, BRITISH PUBLIC!</p> <p>Mother of God, what is he wearing? White jeans and tailored jacket, he looks a bit like an extra from the Village People's video for In The Navy. He does some really irritating posing with his collar up for the paps. Nicole looks on open-mouthed as Davina mocks him affectionately amidst all the booing.</p> <p>Riazatbutt - a trip to Beach Blanket Babylon? Do you think they'd let us in en masse? I suspect the Newmark spies have already blacklisted me for my lack of suitable deference to the golden boy.</p> <p><strong>8.44pm</strong>: Rex and Nicole shout, \"I love you!\" at each other, and are booed for their trouble. He booes them back. Montage of Rex being an utter arsehead to everyone in the house, from paint-smudging to food-stealing to slut-accusations. He laughs a lot when confronted with the evidence of his evil soul. \"I think if you take Big Brother too seriously, then you're on the wrong show,\" he says. Davina tries to push it a bit further, telling him that he was very tough on his housemates. \"If they weren't used to people like me, they shouldn't have come on the show,\" he concludes. When she asks him if he agrees with Mikey that he's a bully, he responds, \"Mikey is the grumpiest person alive.\" Not really an answer, is it?</p> <p>Davina moves on to ask about Nicole, who is booed. \"I love arguing, and I love winding people up!\" he shrieks. \"She loves it!\" The evidence would suggest otherwise, Newmark, bearing in mind she was weeping all the time. Brilliantly, the crowd start chanting, \"Vegas! Vegas!\" and Davina pretends she can't hear it when Rex asks what they're saying, the big cop-out. He then goes on to reiterate how hard he works for his money, and then thanks his dad for moulding him into \"such a wonderful person...my personality has come straight from him.\" Right, we know who to blame, then.</p> <p>Of the three remaining housemates, Rex would like Sara to win. No surprises there. Davina declares him \"an almighty housemate\" (drink!), and we're into a montage of his highlights.</p> <p><strong>8.54pm</strong>: And the drama's not yet over! Davina's back to the house to reveal that the third-placed housemate is - <strong>Sara</strong>!</p> <p>I'm pleasantly surprised, y'know. She won't be leaving till the start of the second instalment, in an hour's time, but she's claiming to be happy to be going, which is just crazy - happy to be going a whole 10 minutes before the winner?</p> <p>So we're down to the shouty Scottish man in a poncho, and the Disney princess from the valleys (who's in a red satin concotion). Who wins? We decide!</p> <p><strong>9.06pm</strong>: I'm going to watch The Tudors for a bit. I am loving Peter O'Toole's interpretation of the Pope. Also, the more I think about it, the more pleased I am that Rachel's got through to the final. Niceness should be rewarded. Admittedly, it's more usually with gold stars on a chart in the classroom, but being in with a shout of \u00a3100,000 is pretty good too. I was appalled to see Darryn Lyons on BBLB briefly yesterday, saying that Rachel won't make any money outside of the house unless she gets her kit off, which is rather sad. I hope that she sticks to her word and goes back to her old life, whatever happens. I feel rather protective towards her.</p> <p><strong>9.13pm</strong>: I don't want to worry you, but there's such a big storm over my house that my television signal's gone down. I may have to go and dig my little portable out of the cupboard under the stairs.</p> <p><strong>9.44pm</strong>: OK, we're up and running again. We've got 15 minutes to kill. What was your highlight of the series?</p> <p><strong>10pm</strong>: We're into the final hour of this marathon BB series. Davina shouts at us to welcome us back. I'm intrigued by your chosen highlights - BaffledbySaussey, I must agree that Fight Night was enthralling if appalling viewing. I did like the take/share dilemma game with Lisa and Sara, though. It was sweet.</p> <p>Davina talks to the house, and she's ready to collect Sara from the doors. Sara tells Mikey to stand up and bid her farewell from the bottom of the stairs, and takes his hand to drag him across the room, failing to notice there's a whacking great chair in the way, which he falls over. Rachel has to pick him up and take care of him while Sara rushes off, and there we have a microcosm of what's happened in this series.</p> <p>Sara gets a nice reception from the crowd, which she's delighted by, as she squeals and giggles her way round the runway, clutching on to Davina. With her free hand, she's holding up her strapless leopard-print tube dress. If I didn't know better, I'd think she, Lisa and Bex had all been shopping in the same place for their finale outfits.</p> <p><strong>10.09pm</strong>: Sara thinks her reception from the crowd was \"amaaaaaaazing...it made me so happy!\" She then witters on about how awful it was waiting for Davina to come and get her. Davina grins at her and declares, \"She is SO SARA.\" Um, yes?</p> <p>Tedious montage of Darnell and Sara being best friends, then hating each other, then being best friends again. \"That was so weeeeeeeeeeeeird! It's craaaaaaaaaaazy!\" she shouts. \"Lately, right now, we're the closest we ever have been...I've forgiven him, I don't hold a grudge.\" Then Davina interrupts her. Sigh. She tries to push her to admit that she knows Darnell fancies her - \"Do you think your behaviour towards him gave him a little sign?\" - and then says that he behaved like a tosspot towards her because his pride had been hurt. Brilliant, Davina. Marvellous strike for feminism.</p> <p>Sara would like Mikey to win - \"He's just so funneeeeeeeee! He's just so raaaaaandom in what he says!\" She thought that she was too annoying and her voice was too irritating to stay in the house for too long, but now she thinks perhaps she was wrong. Davina declares her an awesome housemate (drink!) and into a montage, at the end of which Davina presents her with her cheque for \u00a325,000. Hooray! Good work, Sara!</p> <p>And this is the moment of truth!</p> <p><strong>10.17pm</strong>: The winner of Big Brother 2008 is <strong>RACHEL</strong>!</p> <p>I am really, really pleased - even more than I thought I'd be. I know virtue is its own reward, but \u00a3100,000 is also quite nice. As is triumphing over self-righteous entitled cockheads. She cries and tells Mikey that she loves him over and over again, and then she helps him over to the door, counting him up the stairs once he gets there. He reaches the top, and shouts back, \"I'm glad you won, Rachel!\" Aw.</p> <p>Davina cannot be arsed to go and ACTUALLY get Mikey, contrary to her claims, and a nice security lady does that for her. Once her majesty McCall deigns to talk to him, she drags him round the podium and eads some of the poster slogans.</p> <p><strong>10.26pm</strong>: \"How does it feel to be here, Michael?\" asks Davina. \"Congratulations to Rachel for being the winner of Big Brother!\" he replies. The crowd boo. \"I've said from day one that Rachel wasn't a fraud...I'm glad that Rachel was the winner,\" he shouts. \"She always treated me well. Even though she stayed on the fence, that was just Rachel.\" Davina says that Rachel was opinionated in the diary room. Well, yeah, you can rant in a diary, because that doesn't disturb the equilibrium of the relationships in real life, does it? That's the entire point. Muppet.</p> <p>Davina asks if he's always straight-talking. \"Ask anyone at work...I've also stood up to the bullies in the house,\" he bellows. Davina asks for examples; Mikey says, \"Alec.\" Davina doesn't know who he means, because Alex has been erased from history. She asks what he thinks about Rex now, and he says that he wishes he hadn't been in the final. HAHAHA! Pwned, Newmark!</p> <p>Davina goes on to enquire about how he feels about being the first blind housemate, which triggers a rambling response at high volume, meaning that Davina has to cut in and say, \"It's something to be very proud of.\" Cue montage. Which Mikey, obviously, can't see. The crowd bursts into chants of \"Mikey! Mikey!\" He too has been an awesome housemate. Davina says so. Drink!</p> <p><strong>10.36pm</strong>: Davina talks to Rachel; the door is unlocked. \"I don't want to come out!\" she shouts. It must be quite scary to be left in there after everyone's been evicted. I've always thought that. It's a bit sinister.</p> <p>\"Ladies and gentlemen, it's Rachel!\" announces Davina. Cue fireworks, and much bouncing from Rachel as she surveys the display with pure glee. She waves frantically at everyone, regardless of whether or not she knows them, and squeals and shouts, \"Thank you thank you thank you!\" She's brought Mikey's yellow glass out with her, bless her heart, and Davina promptly takes that off her, as it won't look good in the tabs tomorrow morning.</p> <p><strong>10.43pm</strong>: Rachel looks so pretty tonight with her hair all straightened. Davina tells her it was one of the closest Big Brother finals ever - she and Mikey were neck and neck right up to the end. Mikey shouts to her, as does Kat, who is telling her how much she loves her. Rachel digresses to talk about how weird it is when people leave the house, even when they do nasty things, like Mo breaking wind all the time.</p> <p>Davina asks her why she's opinionated in the diary room but not to the housemates; and obviously, LIKE I JUST SAID, it's because it would cause trouble. \"I know who I am, it's fine,\" she concludes. Davina asks if she fancies Mario - \"He's an attractive guy. If I was 40,\" comes the reply. HAHAHAHA! Brilliant. \"I've got a lovely boyfriend!\" she says. Davina agrees vociferously. \"How can you not be who you are when you're in there for 13 weeks?\" Rachel asks. She looks horrified when Davina tells her about Nicole's accusation that she was only friends with Kat because she thought she'd win; and then Luke is an appalling little scrote because there's no attention on him, shouting about \"game plans\" and making cash signs at her.</p> <p>Davina asks her what she's going to buy with the cash (a car that starts, apparently), then asks what learnt in the house, and interrupts her to cut to a montage. Rachel thanks everyone again and looks like she's going to cry. Another montage, beginning with the housemates' glorious entry into the house; going on to bizarre aggression from Alex; Mario, Lisa and the custard creams; Bex and her boobies; Mikey eating; Stuart being brooding and eyelinered; Fingerpaintgate; Belinda's jazz singing; Luke getting jealous; the arrival of Rex's girlfriend; the disappearance of Maysoon, which nobody noticed; buckets of self-pitying weeping; buckets of bitching - and not just from the OG liveblog squad.</p> <p>Rachel does a little scurry up the runway as more fireworks go off, and - thank you, Channel 4 - there's a warning that 8 Out Of 10 Cats is on next. Switch over, quick!</p> <p>So that's the end of Big Brother 9. Regardless of whether or not you wanted Rachel to win, she is one of the nicest ever housemates locked in that minimalist compound, and I for one am very happy for her. Thanks for your company over the preceding three months.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketturmoil\">Stock markets</a> fell sharply in London and around the world today after further evidence of weakness in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">US jobs market</a> revived worries about the health of the global economy. </p> <p>Jobs data released this afternoon showed that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/usemployment\">unemployment in the US</a> soared to its highest level in nearly five years in August, as the credit crunch continues to takes it toll on the country's already fragile economy.</p> <p>The US Labour Department said that employment in the US outside the agricultural sector fell 84,000 in August, exceeding economists' expectations of a 75,000 drop. </p> <p>There was also an unexpected increase in the country's unemployment rate last month, to 6.1% - the highest since December 2003. Analysts has expected it to remain steady at 5.7%. </p> <p>The US non-farm payroll figures for July were revised up to 60,000 and June's to 100,000 from a previously reported 51,000 in each month. Employers cut payrolls for the eighth consecutive month and also reduced hiring in a bid to save money. </p> <p>The figures were \"very ugly across the board,\" said Boris Schlossberg at GFT Forex, New York. \"The most startling thing for the market was this huge jump in the unemployment rate. That's the highest number in five years. </p> <p>\"The jobless rate suggests that the climate for job expansion has become much more difficult and suggests we are probably going to have a much harder fourth quarter facing us.\"</p> <p>Adding to the gloom was a grim warning from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/nokia\">Nokia</a>, the world's largest mobile phones manufacturer, which said it expects to lose market share in the third quarter as sales slide.</p> <p>In London the FTSE 100 index of leading shares fell 121.4 points to 5240.7, its worst week since July 2002, falling just shy of 400 points over the course of five trading days.</p> <p>In the UK, there is growing evidence that the economy is sliding into recession. The housing market has ground to a halt, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/sep/04/houseprices.property\">prices tumbling 12.7% in August</a>, the biggest annual fall since records began in the early 80s, according to Britain's largest mortgage lender Halifax. Unemployment has risen by 70,000 so far this year and consumer confidence is at an all-time low.</p> <p>Wall Street opened around 40 points lower this afternoon on the back of the jobs data, and was more than 80 points down by the time the London market closed. On Thursday, an unexpected increase in US jobless claims and weak retail sales for August sent US shares tumbling to their worst session in more than two months, with the Dow Jones falling 3%, or 344.65 points, leaving it back in bear market territory.</p> <p>In Asia overnight, Japan's benchmark Nikkei index fell 2.8%, or 345.43 points, to 12,212.23, a five-and-a-half month low, while Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng index dropped 3.1% to 19,752.65, the lowest level in a year. The broader Topix index in Japan lost 2.6% to 1,170.84.</p> <p>The yen soared to a 13-month high against the euro as investors, spooked by the sharp fall in stock markets, fled risky positions such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/aug/24/businessglossary\">leveraged carry trades</a> - positions funded by borrowing yen at lower rates to buy higher-yielding currencies or commodities. The euro fell to \u00a5150.60.</p> <p>\"This is not a flight to quality, it is simply a flight,\" said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital.</p> <p>The pound extended this week's slide, shunned by investors regarding it as more vulnerable against the dollar and the euro. It hit $1.7538, the lowest in two-and-a-half years. Measured against a trade-weighted basket of major currencies, sterling was the weakest since October 1996.</p> <p>Oil prices fell by $1, extending their 8% slide this week. US crude dipped to $106.89 a barrel this morning.</p> <p>Gold benefited from investor worries, with spot gold rising to $798.2/799.3 an ounce.</p>",
  "<p>As Google prepares to blow out the 10 candles on top of its birthday cake this Sunday, founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin can be forgiven for cracking a wry smile as they reflect upon the fire they have just lit under Microsoft.</p> <p>The conflagration that has the creator of Windows running for the fire extinguisher was caused by Google's launch of its own internet browser. The arrival of Chrome, announced in typically idiosyncratic style through the medium of an online comic strip this week, represents more than just a challenge to Microsoft's market-leading Internet Explorer. It represents a fundamental fight over the future of the computer.</p> <p>Microsoft, as so many potential rivals have found over the years, has a stranglehold over the market for the software that runs computers thanks to its hugely successful Windows operating system. So Google has taken heed of the old adage that if you cannot win, change the game.</p> <p>The rise of broadband internet access has finally created an environment where applications such as word processors or spreadsheet programs do not need to reside on a computer. Instead they can be run on the internet and the documents created can be stored on web servers so they can be accessed from anywhere a person can get online. In a world where such web-based applications abound, it does not matter what operating system a computer runs because all it needs to have is an internet browser and an internet connection. In that world, a user could even opt for a free operating system.</p> <p>It's a change that Bill Gates himself foresaw when 13 years ago he wrote an internal memo in which he assigned the \"highest level of importance\" to the internet and warned his colleagues that it was a potential \"tidal wave\" that could fundamentally alter the rules.</p> <p>That memo mentioned then market-leading browser Netscape as having the potential to \"commoditize the underlying operating system\". That infamous memo was one of the catalysts of the browser wars of the late 1990s, which ultimately saw Internet Explorer crush Netscape Navigator, and it also included a line about ensuring that makers of computers ship their machines with a Microsoft browser pre-installed. That practice landed Microsoft in court and led to the effective split of the company. But by then the damage was done and Netscape ended up in the hands of AOL before disappearing all but completely.</p> <p>When Gates testified as part of the anti-trust case brought against the company 10 years ago he was asked what that line about \"commoditizing the operating system\" had meant. He replied: \"They were creating a product that would either reduce the value or eliminate demand for the Windows operating system if they continued to improve it and we didn't keep improving our product.\"</p> <h2>Firefox cub</h2> <p>Ironically, Chrome, which has been roughly two years in the making, builds upon innovations made in browser technology by Microsoft's rival Mozilla, custodian of the Firefox browser, some of whose technological DNA comes from Netscape Navigator.</p> <p>But the browser wars of a decade ago do not live on just within the technology of Chrome, but in Google's decision to create it in the first place. The search engine's chief executive admitted after the launch that \"the browser wars of 10 years ago were right: the browser matters\".</p> <p>Brin added that \"operating systems are kind of an old way to think of the world. They have become kind of bulky ... We [web users] want a very lightweight, fast engine for running applications. The kind of things you want to have running standalone are shrinking.\" </p> <p>That is bad news for Microsoft, which makes a significant chunk of its revenues from its Windows operating system and Office suite of software, both of which sit upon the computer itself.</p> <p>Google, of course, makes pretty much all of its revenues from online search. It has gone from a doctoral project at Stanford University to the world's largest search engine in 10 years, blasting through the traditional media and advertising industries on the way. It is now one of the world's most trusted and recognised brands.</p> <p>Over the past few years, the company has moved into online applications and services such as email, word processing, calendars, instant messaging, maps, spreadsheets and even bought the online video phenomenon YouTube. </p> <p>But ultimately everything it does is about persuading people to do more with the internet. The more time people spend online, the more likely they are to search for something and the more likely they are to generate revenues for Google or queries that help improve its search algorithm. So why would it want to dabble with browsers?</p> <p>Firstly, the sense that Google's executives have given over the past few days is that if the rest of the industry had produced good enough browsers, there would have been no need for them to create Chrome.</p> <p>Announcing the launch of Chrome \u2014 which was leaked after a Google staffer posted a copy of the 38-page comic that heralded the move \u2014 the company said on its website: \"People are spending an increasing amount of time online, and they're doing things never imagined when the web first appeared about 15 years ago.</p> <p>\"We realized that the web had evolved from mainly simple text pages to rich, interactive applications and that we needed to completely rethink the browser. What we really needed was not just a browser, but also a modern platform for web pages and applications, and that's what we set out to build.\"</p> <h2>Android attack</h2> <p>Chrome, according to early testers, is certainly faster than many of the browsers already in the market \u2014 especially the current version of Internet Explorer \u2014 and it has been engineered so that if one website being visited freezes up, the entire program does not crash.</p> <p>Google has moved into another area \u2014 mobile phones \u2014 for roughly similar reasons. The creation of its Android operating system for mobile phones \u2014 the first device that runs it is expected in time for Christmas \u2014 owes much to the fact that the mobile internet has been promised for years but the industry's love of proprietary systems has held back its arrival. The first gadget to deliver on the promise of the mobile web, Apple's iPhone, owes some of its success to the fact that it is an \"open\" platform, so anyone who uses common web standards can create applications for it. Android is also an open mobile platform, in the same way as Chrome is an open browser platform.</p> <p>But Chrome is also a crucial defensive play for Google. If you rely \u2014 as it does \u2014 on people having access to the internet to make your money you not only want to make it as simple as possible but ensure no one gets in your way. </p> <p>The new, eighth version of Internet Explorer, which is due out soon, includes the ability to view web pages anonymously. Erasing a user's online footprints would make it harder for Google to collect the data about visitors that it uses to improve search results and serve relevant adverts.</p> <p>Chrome also has an anonymous browsing mode \u2014 which has quickly been dubbed \"porn mode\" because it hides details of where the user has been from other users of the same machine \u2014 but Google will still know what that user has been doing online.</p> <p>Then there is the fact that browsers increasingly contain search boxes within them, raising the risk that a popular new browser could slowly squeeze Chrome out of the market by signing up with a rival search engine.</p> <p>Google has already been hedging its bets. It has a deal with the Mozilla Foundation, a non-profit-making organisation that funds the development of Firefox, the web's second most popular browser, to have its search box within the browser itself. Just last month Google extended that deal \u2014 which has recently generated more than three quarters of Mozilla's revenues \u2014 until 2011. Google's toolbar is already standard on Apple's Safari browser and can also be downloaded and installed on Internet Explorer.</p> <p>Chrome has excited the tech world but ultimately it all comes down to money and for Google that means more people searching more often. As Citigroup put it in a note to clients this week: \"Given that search has become such a fundamental part of internet usage, anything that impacts overall internet usage is important for Google.\"</p>",

It involves collecting, transporting and then burying the CO2 so that it does not escape into the atmosphere and contribute to climate change. </p> <p>There are three main techniques: the post-combustion process involves scrubbing the power plant's exhaust gas using chemicals. Pre-combustion CCS takes place before the fuel is placed in the furnace by first converting coal into a clean-burning gas and stripping out the CO2 released by the process. The third method, oxyfuel, burns the coal in an atmosphere with a higher concentration of pure oxygen, resulting in an exhaust gas that is almost pure CO2. (See below for further details).</p> <p>Once the CO2 has been trapped, it is liquefied, transported \u2013 sometimes for several hundred miles \u2013 and buried, either in suitable geological formations, deep underground saline aquifers or disused oil fields. The last method is often used in a process called \"enhanced oil recovery\", where CO2 is pumped into an oil field to force out the remaining pockets of oil that would otherwise prove difficult to extract.</p> <p>The technology is not cheap \u2013 up to 40% of a power station's energy could end up being used to run the CCS scrubbing and transport systems and experts estimate the average cost of retro-fitting Britain's aged power stations at about \u00a31bn each. Pipes to transport the CO2 to suitable burial sites could cost \u00a31m per mile. The oldest power stations may end up being uneconomical to refit.</p> <p>All the components of CCS have been in use by oil companies and chemical engineering plants for decades. But, so far, only a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/sep/05/carboncapturestorage.carbonemissions\">small pilot project at Vatenfall's Schwarze Pumpe power station</a> in northern Germany has connected all the different stages of the CCS chain together. The pilot is an oxyfuel boiler that can generate 30MW of heat and around 12MW of electricity. </p> <h2>Trapping methods</h2> <p><strong>Post-combustion<br></strong>In the post-combustion method, CO2 is separated from the flue gas of the power station by bubbling the gas through an absorber column packed with liquid solvents (such as ammonia) that preferentially take out the CO2. In the most commonly-used techniques, once the chemicals in the absorber column become saturated, a stream of superheated steam at around 120C is passed through it. This releases the trapped CO2, which can then be transported for storage elsewhere.</p> <p>More experimental techniques to scrub CO2 from flue gas without the two-step process include using seawater to absorb the gas and then returning the mixture back to the ocean for long-term storage. But, so far, these methods have proved less efficient and reliable.</p> <p><strong>Oxyfuel</strong><br>When coal, oil or natural gas is burned in normal air, the amount of CO2 produced is between 3-15% of the waste gases, depending on the conditions. Separating the greenhouse gas out after combustion requires energy so an alternative CCS method is to burn the fossil fuel in an atmosphere of pure oxygen. In this environment, virtually all the waste gas will be composed CO2 and water vapour. The latter can be condensed out while the former can be piped or transported directly to a storage facility. </p> <p>In the oxyfuel system, the air fed into the boiler has to be separated into liquid oxygen, gaseous nitrogen, argon and other trace gases and this process can use up to 15% of the power produced at the station.</p> <p><strong>Pre-combustion</strong><br>This method is normally applied to coal-gasification combined cycle power plants. The coal is gasified to produce a synthetic gas made from carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The former is reacted with water to produce CO2, which is captured, and more hydrogen. The hydrogen can be diverted to a turbine where it can be burned to produce electricity. Alternatively, some of this gas can be bled off to feed hydrogen fuel cells for cars. </p> <p>One disadvantage of the pre-combustion method is that it cannot be retro-fitted to the older pulversised coal power plants that make up much of the world's installed base of fossil fuel power. It could perhaps be used in natural gas stations, where a synthetic gas is first produced by reacting the methane with steam to produce carbon dioxide and hydrogen. But the economic advantage of this method over post-combustion is yet to be proven.</p>",

  "<p>The media verdict on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/05/uselections2008.johnmccain2\">John McCain's acceptance speech</a> is that the Republican presidential nominee is a narcolepsy-inducing contortionist.</p> <p>At the biggest moment of his political career, he delivered a flat, stupefyingly boring address that drained away all the excitement generated by Sarah Palin's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/05/sarah.palin.speech\">pit-bull-with-lipstick performance</a> the night before. His central message - that it's time to clean up Washington - was incoherent. Yes, McCain has some legitimate reformist credentials. But he's also a 25-year Washington insider who marches in lockstep with George Bush on such issues as the war in Iraq and tax cuts for the wealthy.</p> <p>\"It really is an audacious ploy, to tell people that the country's got to correct the mistakes made by a political party when that's the very party you represent,\" <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/05/AR2008090500121.html?hpid=topnews\">writes Tom Shales</a> in today's Washington Post. \"It's like staging a revolution against yourself - saying that the Republicans have got to go so the Republicans can move in and clean up the mess.\"</p> <p>Last Friday there was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/29/barackobama.media?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=global\">no shortage of punditry</a> to sift through following Barack Obama's speech. Today the offerings are comparatively light and perfunctory. The bloviators still want to bloviate about Palin's speech, which electrified the convention-centre crowd, if not necessarily the public at large.</p> <p>\"For all the hullabaloo about whether John McCain would match Sarah Palin's performance at the Republican convention, it wasn't even close,\" <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-heilbrunn/mccain-fails-to-deliver-a_b_124112.html\">observes Jacob Heilbrunn</a> in the Huffington Post. He adds that \"most of his speech was a snooze, delivered in the tone of a kindly old uncle reminiscing about World War II before fretting about how those pesky Russians are stirring up trouble again.\"</p> <p>Writing in Slate, <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/blogs/trailhead/archive/2008/09/05/post-palin-depression.aspx\">Christopher Beam attributes</a> the live audience's \"tepid reaction\" to \"post-Palin depression\".</p> <p>And in the Boston Phoenix, <a href=\"http://thephoenix.com/BLOGS/dontquoteme/archive/2008/09/04/mccain-s-speech-quite-a-comedown.aspx\">Adam Reilly offers</a> a telling (if unimaginable) hypothetical: \"Suppose Sarah Palin had somehow ended up as the Republican presidential nominee this year. Suppose she'd picked John McCain as her running mate. And suppose he'd given the speech he did tonight. You know what people would be saying? 'Crap. She should have gone with Giuliani'.\"</p> <p>Incredibly, McCain's handlers even managed to reprise the <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/213806.php\">widely mocked green background</a> that punctuated his dreadful speech on the night that Obama clinched the Democratic nomination. But colour coordination wasn't the main problem then, and it wasn't last night, either.</p> <p>Damning with extraordinarily faint praise is the order of the day at the conservative National Review. \"The eloquent absence of eloquence\" is the headline on <a href=\"http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YzAyYmRiNTA5YzQ0ZTJhNDlkMTIwNjczMGNlNDgzMWE=\">Peter Robinson's reaction piece</a>. In a, shall we say, counterintuitive bit of speech analysis, <a href=\"http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NzdjZWJjYjI0ZDk0MzkzYzJjMDY0OWNiMzc1MjZkNzQ=\">Rich Lowry instructs us</a>: \"Don't focus on the oratory. ... Don't focus on the delivery.\" The ever-hopeful <a href=\"http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=Mzg1ZjczNzBhNzQ4OTcxNWRiMDZmZDhiNTk0NmEwMWI=\">Jonah Goldberg adds</a>: \"I think there was nothing to the speech that actually hurt him.\"</p> <p>Hurt? Maybe not. But McCain's speech certainly did not help the Republicans' already precarious standing. The new star of the party is the deeply flawed Palin. McCain's brain trust is desperately trying to <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0908/13143.html\">smear the media</a> for smearing the Palin family, but the truth is that most of the press clippings, including those about 17-year-old Bristol Palin's pregnancy, have been exceedingly kind.</p> <p>The real focus of media inquiry has been on more-substantive issues: the bipartisan investigation into whether Palin <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/03/AR2008090303210.html?hpid=artslot\">abused her office</a> by firing the public-safety commissioner for refusing to get rid of her ex-brother-in-law; her <a href=\"http://www.adn.com/sarahpalin/story/511471.html\">selective memory</a> about the \"bridge to nowhere\"; her association with the <a href=\"http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/09/members-of-frin.html\">Alaskan Independence party</a>, whose founder <a href=\"http://www.akip.org/introduction.html\">proclaimed</a> that he had \"no use for America or her damned institutions\"; and her anti-science positions on such matters as <a href=\"http://dwb.adn.com/news/politics/elections/story/8347904p-8243554c.html\">creationism</a> and <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0808/12995.html\">global warming</a>.</p> <p>Palin may have aroused the base, but she'll likely prove to be a drag on the ticket among the independents and conservative Democrats whom McCain needs to win.</p> <p>Most pundits did give McCain decent marks for retelling the story of his captivity in Vietnam. But here, too, he managed to step on his own moment. By letting virtually every surrogate this week speak about McCain's POW experience in dramatic, hushed tones, McCain allowed it to be robbed of much of its power before he finally got to talk about it himself.</p> <p>The most positive assessment of the speech I could find is by <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2008/09/05/rnc_thurs/\">Walter Shapiro, writing in Salon</a>. Though conceding that McCain fell well short of Obama's and Palin's performances, Shapiro says: \"McCain may have found the right words to appeal to the voters he needs to win, especially an older generation in hard-pressed normally Democratic industrial states like Michigan and Pennsylvania.\"</p> <p>Well, perhaps. But in the immediate aftermath, I think most observers are going to <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/04/john-mccain-speech-reacti_n_124115.html\">agree instead with Jeffrey Toobin</a>, who on CNN last night called it \"the worst speech by a nominee that I've heard since Jimmy Carter in 1980\" - \"disorganised, themeless ... [and] shockingly bad.\"</p>",

  "<p>A Hindu man is to ask the high court to overturn a ban on open-air cremations to allow the ancient religious ritual to take place in Britain. </p> <p>Davender Kumar Ghai, 69, is challenging Newcastle city council's decision to deny him an open-air cremation when he dies. In 2006 the local authority blocked his attempt to establish Britain's first approved site for burning bodies in the open, ruling it would breach cremation laws. </p> <p>Human rights lawyers will argue that open-air pyres fall outside the 1902 Cremation Act, which regulates what happens inside a crematorium, defined as \"any building fitted with appliances for the purpose of burning human remains\".</p> <p>The burning of a human body in the open air, they will say, is an offence only if it causes a public nuisance, which would be avoided because the sites would be in secluded locations. The hearing in November is expected to last three days.</p> <p>Indic religions allow open-air cremations, although these are not compulsory nor universal. </p> <p>Hinduism regards the body as an external garment that the individual inhabits. When this garment becomes worn out the individual moves on, taking a new birth and a new body. </p> <p>According to the 2001 census there were 558,342 Hindus in the UK although the figure is thought to be closer to 1 million, based on immigration levels. </p> <p>Andrew Singh Dogan, the legal coordinator of the multi-faith Anglo-Asian Friendship Society, said a positive outcome would primarily benefit Hindus, although people from all backgrounds could opt for an open-air cremation.</p> <p>\"An open-air pyre is \u00a3500 and a cheaper alternative to a traditional cremation, which costs at least \u00a32,000 and has you in and out in half an hour. An open-air pyre allows you to make it an all-day event, where you can eat, drink and cry and make it a family occasion.</p> <p>\"This ritual has been practised, virtually unchanged, in India for thousands of years. We've had many letters of support from individuals and organisations. Mr Ghai is a devout Hindu who wishes to be cremated according to Hindu scripture.\"</p> <p>Ghai, who is the head of the friendship society, was responsible for the first human funeral pyre in Britain since 1934, when the Home Office authorised the outdoor cremation of Sumshere Jung, a Nepalese princess and the wife of the Nepalese ambassador.</p> <p>Ghai also arranged for the body of Rajpal Mehat, a 31-year-old Indian illegal immigrant found drowned in a London canal, to be burnt on a wooden pyre at a secret location in Northumberland in 2006.</p> <p>Newcastle council deemed the ceremony illegal and a police file was passed to the Crown Prosecution Service. It ruled that an offence had been committed, but said prosecution would not be in the public interest.</p> <p>Jay Lakhani, of the Hindu Academy, described open-air cremation as an \"antiquated practice\".</p> <p>\"Modern India is growing up and in tiny villages where they don't have facilities they have these pyres. In Britain we are very lucky to have hygienic crematoriums. The ceremonial aspects should evolve to reflect the changes in society.\"</p> <p>A spokesman from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs refused to comment on the environmental impact of open-air cremations, saying the matter was subject to a judicial review.</p>",
  "<p>I smelt a rat the moment I walked into Design Cities, the Design Museum's new exhibition, which tells the story of modern design through seven influential times and locations. It's a promising idea. All too often design tends to be exhibited like art: biographically and/or chronologically to reflect the output of an individual or group. Nothing wrong with that, of course, but here's an exhibition that seeks to put things into a wider context by putting the work of disparate groups next to each other. There are considerable rewards to be gained from say, looking across the room (this is a one-room exhibition) from a life-sized wooden model of Le Corbusier's bizarre Prototype Car of 1929 \u2013 a laughably naive stab at early automotive design - to Nissan's almost identical S-Cargo van of 1989 \u2013 now a perfectly viable commercial product, or comparing Josef Hoffman's bizarrely experimental cutlery set from 1904 to Future Systems' equally counter-intuitive set from this year.</p> <p>But that rat I smelt was this: the exhibition starts in London, 1851, and finishes in London, 2008. In between we travel through Vienna 1908, Dessau 1928, Paris 1936, Los Angeles 1949, Milan 1957 and Tokyo 1987, but concluding the exhibition in today's London raises some troubling questions and uncomfortable associations. With the Olympic Games so fresh in the memory, the list of cities and dates feels rather familiar, as does the conclusion with London, as we begin counting down to the 2012 games. Should we infer that great design has been passed like a relay baton through modern history, and is now being handed back to us Brits, its rightful owners? Given our recent performance in the relays perhaps that's a bad analogy, maybe it's more of a cycling Madison, now that we all know what that is. But the implicit message is, \"Design's Coming Home\". We Brits invented it, and now Team GB is the centre of the design world once again. To underline the point, one of the exhibits in the London 2008 section is a model of Zaha Hadid's curvaceous Aquatic Centre for London 2012, although the design has gone through so many changes already, it will probably be out of date by the time the exhibition ends.</p> <p>The London of 1851 and the Great Exhibition is a fair starting point, even if there's little on Paxton's hugely influential steel-and-glass structure or its contents. Instead the focus is on William Morris and his obdurate defence of craftsmanship versus Christopher Dresser, one of the first to embrace the inevitable future of commercial design and mass production. But some of the other choices are more surprising. Was Dessau a great design city? Or just a place where the Bauhaus moved, largely for political reasons? Come to think of it, is Dessau a city at all? And the selection of these seven cities inevitably omits huge expanses of design history \u2013 Scandinavia, the Netherlands, modern Germany, eastern Europe, take your pick.</p> <p>My issues didn't stop there, I'm afraid. The relationship between design and the cities in which it has been practised \u2013 the point of the exhibition - is not always evident from the exhibits themselves. What you're mostly looking at is chairs, with the odd sample of tableware, furniture, architecture and graphics in each camp. The scale and focus is primarily domestic, rather than urban. Surely to get a sense of the cities that inspired these moments, we need to see more of the cities themselves? Or at least get a sense of urban life through graphics, fashion, magazines, textiles, packaging and a lot more architecture. Pop culture doesn't get much of a look-in here, but its omission only points up how useful it is in defining times and places. In 1936 Paris we get a selection of Le Corbusier's chairs, but very little of the houses (in Paris) he designed around them. We get a lot of Eames furniture in Los Angeles 1949, but none of the fabulous houses by Richard Neutra or Rudolph Schindler that were surely part of the landscape. </p> <p>The most successful part for me is Milan 1957, where you really can sense the kind of \"moment\" the exhibition is all about. Looking at modern classics like Joe Colombo's plastic Boby Trolley, or Castiglioni's timeless Arco lamp, or Ettore Sottsass' Olivetti typewriter, one can detect a common spirit of sophistication and playfulness, a city on the rise and looking to the future. And the section on Tokyo, with proto electronic gadgets like the first Sony Walkman (surely the Walkman II was the classic?), Shiro Kuramata's elegant wire-mesh chair and a solitary Issey Miyake outfit left me wanting to see more. And wishing they'd had more room. To make a show like this really work you'd need a room devoted to each city \u2013 perhaps that's what it would have got in Tokyo or Los Angeles, but not in London.</p> <p>The conclusion that London is now a, if not <em>the</em>, centre of the design world is not unreasonable. But looking at the London 2008 section, I started to wonder if we shouldn't be celebrating London's cultural pluralism rather than banging some nationalistic drum. The London 2008 exhibits include Ron Arad (Israeli), Zaha Hadid (Iraqi), Fernando Gutierrez (Spanish) and Jan Kaplicky (Czech), alongside homebred talent like Tom Dixon, Ross Lovegrove, and Jasper Morrison. Are national borders, or even city borders, still an issue in an era of global production? Aren't we in a new era now, where design and production is no longer constrained or determined by geography? Perhaps the logical place to terminate this particular design journey would have been the gift shop, which is full of clever little ideas and cutting edge designs from all over the place.</p>",
  "<p>In selecting Alaska governor Sarah Palin as his running mate, John McCain is dusting off an old GOP tool: the estrogen guard. Slap a friendly, female face on a hardcore-conservative political platform, and pray that the pundits will only take pot-shots and talk about gender. It worked for George Bush and it just may work for Palin. </p> <p>Watching Palin <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/sep/05/ustelevision.tvratings\">address</a> the Republican National Convention in St Paul on Wednesday, I could have sworn I heard <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine_Harris\">Katherine Harris</a> cheer. Remember Harris, Florida's secretary of state in 2001, and co-chair of her state's Bush/Cheney committee? No one did more to snag the White House for her man - and no one was laughed and scoffed at more heartily by the media. While the press poo-poo'ed her makeup (\"She seems to have applied her makeup with a trowel,\" wrote the Washington Post) and introduced her to the public as caricature (\"<a href=\"http://politicalhumor.about.com/library/blcruella.htm\">Cruella de Ville</a>\",) as Florida's top election-cop, Harris purged enough voter rolls, understaffed enough voting places and ill-equipped the voting system sufficiently to guarantee election day chaos. Parodied in the press, she rose to stardom in the GOP. Come inauguration day 2001, Florida Republicans threw an enormous bash for the woman they dubbed \"our Joan of Arc\". Soon after she was elected to Congress. </p> <p>So it is with Palin. While her record stinks, so does the media coverage. In place of serious discussion of her policies on the environment, on human rights, on taxes, free speech and governance, we've had five days of \"Veep pregnant teen shock\". There's more than enough misogyny in the mix to give the McCain camp a stick to beat any truly investigative members of press-corps with. </p> <p>Desperate for female votes - a group the Democrats have taken for granted for years - McCain clearly hopes his Palin pick will burnish his appeal among middle-of-the-road women. It's a long-shot. Palin believes abortion is a crime even in the case of rape and incest (a position that was too draconian even for the voters of South Dakota). She supports teaching creationism in schools as strongly as she opposed, as governor, environmental protections for the Holy planet. </p> <p>The hypocrisy is rank. Bristol, Palin's daughter \"made the decision on her own to keep the baby,\" McCain's aides told the press. That's not a choice pregnant teens would have under the proposed administration of her mother and McCain. As for her claims to oppose corruption and pork \u2013 according to the Alaska press, she supported that costly bridge to \"nowhere\" for years, before finally cancelling it as governor. And experience? Again, according to Alaskan papers, during Palin's tenure as mayor, most of the actual work of running small Wasilla was turned over to an administrator after Palin's precipitous firings gave rise to a recall campaign. Mayor Palin even tried to fire the city librarian after she demurred at a proposal to censor the library's collection.</p> <p>Will the media see the substance or only the Ms Congeniality image? We'll find out soon enough. But it's likely she'll get plenty of jabs in before then if her first performance on the national stage is anything to go by. Palin can dig at Barack Obama more effectively than her running mate. (Does anyone not hear the racism in her allusion to McCain's as \"the sort of name you find on small town war memorials\"?) And if you're counting on her getting a grilling on the campaign trail, don't hold your breath. Reading from the Karen Hughes/Karl Rove campaign playbook, the McCain team will keep Palin from answering questions, as they also did for a young Texas governor called Bush. They're already de-legitimating the questioners, and there will simply be no access for anyone but Fox News pals - and those who act like them.</p> <p>So will a public that has been fed a fact-free diet of John McCain the \"maverick\" see through Palin, the fresh-faced feminist? Don't bet on it.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown today faced a backlash from the Labour movement after signalling that the government will not be making cash payments to low-income families to help them with the cost of rising fuel bills.</p> <p>Tony Woodley, the joint leader of the Unite union, said that the prime minister ought to be forcing energy companies to contribute to a subsidy programme because people were going to be in \"very, very serious trouble\" when they had to pay the bills to heat their homes in the winter.</p> <p>And Fabian Hamilton, one of the Labour MPs campaigning for a windfall tax on energy companies, said that the consequences could be \"very serious indeed\" for Labour.</p> <p>Ministers have been negotiating with the energy companies in the hope of getting them to subsidise extra help for those on low incomes and in the summer there were reports that there could be one-off payments worth up to \u00a3150 to help people with their bills.</p> <p>But last night, in a speech to the Scottish CBI, Brown signalled that this was no longer an option.</p> <p>In an interview on BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning, Woodley said that Brown had to stand up to \"vested interests\" and help ordinary people.</p> <p>He said: \"This is about the society we live in. Are we going to see market forces rule? Or is the Labour party going \u2026 to stand up for the ordinary people in our country that are going to struggle?</p> <p>\"This is no longer about lagging the lofts, this is about looking after people who are going to be in very, very serious trouble to heat their homes here.\"</p> <p>The government ought to go further than implementing a windfall tax, Woodley said. \"We need to legislate to cap these price rises from these greedy utilities so that we help the ordinary family in our country.</p> <p>\"If we don't do that then we would have betrayed our people and we would have betrayed our country.\"</p> <p>On Newsnight last night, Hamilton, the Labour MP for Leeds North East, said Labour could be damaged if it was not seen to be helping those who have most to lose from the rising cost of energy.</p> <p>\"And I think that people like me - who are strong supporters of Gordon Brown and the current government as it's constituted - I think that our support might fade away considerably if we don't see the very people that we are trying to help supported by Labour,\" he said.</p> <p>Brown's speech last night followed reports that ministers are failing to persuade the energy companies to contribute voluntarily to the cost of one-off payments.</p> <p>Officially the government has not ruled out extracting money from them using a windfall tax. But ministers worry that this could backfire, because the cost could be passed on to customers, and the companies do not appear to be taking the threat of it very seriously.</p> <p>The government's package to help people deal with rising fuel prices will instead centre on extra financial help from electricity producers to pay for home efficiency measures, targeted at low-income households. Brown is still hoping to tout the programme as worth \u00a31bn. But Downing Street is concerned that the package will disappoint Labour backbenchers eager to see a big windfall tax on the electricity firms.</p> <p>Hilary Benn, the environment secretary, told the BBC's World at One that Woodley was wrong to dismiss energy efficiency measures as just \"lagging the loft\". He said proper insulation could save householders about \u00a3100 a year.</p> <p>\"You can provide help to pay the bills this year, but then the bills are there next year,\" he said.</p> <p>\"If you can get energy use down by better insulation measures, by more cost-effective appliances \u2026 [you can] help people reduce their bills now and the year after and the year after that.\"</p> <p>Benn said that the energy companies were already spending \u00a32.8bn over the next three years to help people reduce their bills through the carbon emissions reduction target programme.</p> <p>He went on: \"I think it is only fair that the energy companies should make a further contribution to assist customers this winter. The discussions that are taking place are about the best form should take.\"</p> <p>Last night Brown said he was working up proposals with the utility companies. He told the Scottish CBI: \"Not short-term gimmicks, or giveaways, but firm steps towards making every home in Britain more energy efficient, thus reducing bills not just temporarily, but permanently. You cannot address a long-term problem \u2014 the supply and demand for oil \u2014 with a short-term gimmick.\"</p> <p>Government sources said all the additional direct government help to soften the impact of fuel bills had already been set out in the March budget when increases in the winter fuel allowance had been announced.</p> <p>Ministers are instead focusing on extracting extra funding from the energy companies for the carbon emissions reduction target programme, a \u00a31.5bn, three-year obligation on energy suppliers to install home-based energy efficiency measures for people on low incomes, those with disabilities and those aged over 70. But talks with the energy firms are incomplete.</p> <p>Richard Lambert, the CBI director general, warned against a windfall tax, saying the worst way to assist the fuel-poor \"would be to impose an arbitrary and unfair tax on the energy industry, just at a moment when we want those same companies to be preparing for vastly increased investment in our energy infrastructure\". But the Local Government Association claimed the big six electricity producers had boosted dividend payments to shareholders by \u00a3257m over the last year, suggesting they were not ploughing their profits into investment.</p> <p>Brown said he was \"cautiously optimistic about the long-term resilience and underlying strengths of the British economy.\" He said: \"At root our economy is better placed to weather any global economic storm than it was the 70s, 80s or early 90s\".</p> <p>After chancellor Alistair Darling's more gloomy forecasts in his recent Guardian interview, Brown said he rested his cautious optimism on continued historically low interest rates, subdued wage pressures, fast-growing productivity, continued low levels of public debt as a proportion of national income, and the \"most robust independent competition regime anywhere in the world\". The government would not let down hard-working families on modest and middle income families: \"We will ensure that no one who is prepared to work hard and adapt to change will lose out as a result of global forces.\"</p> <p>But Britain could not pull up the drawbridge, or be immunised against the first great financial crisis of the global age, a crisis allied to a \"global credit crunch and global rises in commodity prices\".</p> <p>The shadow chancellor, George Osborne, said: \"The prime minister is in denial about both the crisis of confidence in his leadership and the economic crisis facing the country. His speech is totally at odds with the bleak assessment given by his chancellor just five days ago.</p> <p>\"At a time when Britain needs strong and united leadership with a clear sense of direction, we have a Labour government descending into civil war and a chancellor and a prime minister who publicly disagree on the severity of the problems we face.\"</p>",
  "<p>Yesterday's <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/view_press_release.jsp?releaseid=18677\">announcement</a> by Boris Johnson that fares on London's public transport will rise by an average of six percent - a point more than inflation - from January was a war waiting to happen. The hostilities did not disappoint. From Thursday's briefing of transport hacks \u2013 conducted by lucky old <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/team/directors.jsp\">Kulveer Ranger</a>, the mayor's transport director \u2013 and into the following day the Johnson strategy was to pin the blame for the hike on Ken Livingstone. Livingstone's was to counter attack. They were still at it <a href=\"http://davehill.typepad.com/london3ms/2008/09/fares-rise-ken.html\">tea time</a>.</p> <p>This was touchy territory for both of them. Keeping bus and Tube prices down has been a Livingstone signature since his famous \"Fares Fair\" policy when <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/uk_politics/2000/london_mayor/736460.stm\">leader of the GLC,</a> which set the establishment at his throat but caused London's public to warm to the then \"Red Ken\" no end. During this year's election campaign he'd pledged no fares increases, despite Transport for London wanting them. Voters shouldn't be surprised they're going up under Johnson - there had been mutterings about \"tough decisions\" for some time \u2013 but an inflation-plus increase will not endear him. </p> <p>The most telling thing about the propaganda battle has been the terms of the protagonists' engagement. There's been much squabbling about black holes and where they come from. Livingstone's <a href=\"http://davehill.typepad.com/london3ms/2008/09/fare-rises-ken.html\">line</a> is that Johnson is subsidising the cost of his own prejudices, bridging a funding gap created by his abandonment of the former mayor's planned super congestion <a href=\"http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-mayor/article-23512870-details/Boris+scraps+Ken's+plan+to+hit+gas-guzzlers+with+%A325+congestion+charge/article.do\">charge on gas guzzlers</a> and his decision to <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7419227.stm\">hand back to Venezuela</a> up to \u00a37 million from Livingstone's controversial oil deal with Hugo Chavez. </p> <p>Johnson insists he's been obliged to fill a looming void created by his predecessor's \"largesse\" and political manoeuvring. He <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/assembly/budgmtgs/2008/sep04/agenda.jsp\">insisted</a> this when grilled for breakfast by the London Assembly's Budget and Performance Committee and in the <a href=\"http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-mayor/article-23550944-details/Commentary%3A+Rise+will+fix+Ken%27s+TfL+black+hole/article.do\">column</a> kindly provided for him by the Ken-hating editor of the Evening Standard and he'll probably still be insisting it for years to come. </p> <p>Who will triumph in this great struggle? That partly depends, of course, on who you prefer to believe but also on your priorities. Johnson says he's practising good husbandry partly to safeguard the huge Crossrail project, which will link Stratford to Heathrow. His critics are <a href=\"http://www.boriswatch.co.uk/2008/09/04/fare-rises-the-details/\">doubtful</a> about the maths and <a href=\"http://torytroll.blogspot.com/2008/09/what-other-transport-cuts-will-boris.html\">suspect</a> spending cuts are coming. Green AMs <a href=\"http://davehill.typepad.com/london3ms/2008/09/fares-rise-gree.html\">reckon</a> that at a time of high petrol prices he should be keeping fares low to encourage more people to switch from cars to public transport. Make up your own minds, people. But don't forget that sooner or later someone's going to have to pay for that <a href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/corporate/projectsandschemes/technologyandequipment/anewbusforlondon/default.aspx\">new bus</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Another week, another <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/faithschools\">furore of criticism</a> of faith schools - this time stirred up by the new <a href=\"http://www.accordcoalition.org.uk/\">Accord</a> coalition, co-created by the British Humanist Association, of which Polly Toynbee is chair. Yes, that would be the same Polly Toynbee whose <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/02/education.labour\">column</a> in Tuesday's Guardian fulsomely praises Accord and indiscriminately attacks faith schools. <br> Instead, she should be celebrating this week, as one of the most radical pieces of Education legislation comes into force: a duty to promote community cohesion imposed on all state-funded schools. Yes, not just faith schools but all schools and I suspect therein lies the rub for Accord. Once all schools, including faith schools, are inspected by <a href=\"http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/\">Ofsted</a> on how successfully they promote cohesion, a standard will be set by which we can truly judge what they contribute to wider society instead of relying on the inevitably biased studies which are frequently produced by those on both sides of the argument to prove their points.</p> <p>But members of Accord take no account of the education world as a whole. Yes, of course, there are schools in Britain which are segregated, eg schools which are 98% Bengali Muslim (not faith schools but inner city London schools) and many which are 100% white (again, not faith schools but rural schools all over the country). The main thing which determines diversity or the lack of it in a school's admissions is not faith but location, and the intake of state-funded faith schools often reflects a broader ethnic and socio-economic range than comprehensive schools in the same area.</p> <p>I say \"often\" and not \"always\" because unlike those who criticise faith schools, I don't want to over-generalise. For a group that says it's focused on encouraging diversity, Accord talks about faith schools as homogenous entities. They are not. <br> My organisation, the <a href=\"http://www.boardofdeputies.org.uk/\">Board of Deputies of British Jews</a>, represents state-funded Jewish schools and is rightly proud to do so. Jewish schools provide an environment where our young people, very often already thoroughly integrated British kids, can connect with and learn about their Jewish heritage in ways that would otherwise simply not be available to them. To deny them that would actually represent a triumph of uniformity over diversity whereas, secure in their Jewish roots, they are better equipped to make a profound contribution to civil society. <br> Of course there are some \"bad\" faith schools, just as there are good and bad schools in every part of the education sector. But to cast faith schools as a whole as a wicked or divisive force in society does a huge disservice to the many excellent faith schools which work tirelessly to couple high quality education with religious values of respect and care for others.  Many parents choose faith schools for their children and parental choice is a fundamental tenet of education law. European human rights legislation guarantees the rights of parents to schooling compatible with their religious and philosophical beliefs. I stand as one of the members of the Faith School Providers Group to guarantee that faith schools will continue to work to be a positive educational choice, encouraging social responsibility and fulfilling their duty to promote community cohesion.</p>",
  "<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/hmvgroup\">HMV</a></strong> reported a slowdown in sales growth today as revenues from the Waterstone's bookshops business fell and the overall economic picture darkened.</p> <p>The company, which is into the second year of a recovery plan to shift its focus away from traditional CD sales, said that like-for-like sales across the whole group rose just 1.3% on last year in the 18 weeks to the end of August. That compares with a 7.3% increase over the whole of the year that ended on April 26.</p> <p>At Waterstone's, which accounted for just under 30% of HMV's turnover last year, sales dropped 4.3%. Some of this was attributable to the rush of sales for the seventh and final Harry Potter book in July last year, setting a tough precedent for this summer. </p> <p>But even excluding the first eight days of Harry Potter sales, Waterstone's sales fell by 1.7%. Last year Waterstone's sales grew by 3.3%. The company blamed its slide on a \"weaker book market\" but said its market share would be maintained. </p> <p>At HMV's stores in Britain and Ireland, like-for-like sales were up 4.3%, slowing from the 11.4% recorded last year. HMV said it has been increasing the mix of games and technology to compensate for falling CD sales, and reported market share gains for all products. Yesterday it launched its largest \"next generation\" store so far, in Liverpool.</p> <p>At the international division, which comprises HMV's operations Canada, Hong Kong and Singapore, the group reported growth of 2.9%, compared with a 1.3% decline last year. It said this was partly because games now made up more than 10% of sales at HMV Canada. </p> <p>Speaking to investors at the group's annual meeting today, chief executive Simon Fox said: \"In what is, undoubtedly, a tough consumer environment, the solid start made by the group to the new financial year means that our plans are in line with the board's expectations, and I remain confident that our strategic initiatives are on track.</p> <p>\"As we approach the peak selling period, our focus is on continuing to provide our customers with the very best offers, from what is shaping up to be a strong line-up across all product categories for Christmas.\"</p> <p>Shares in HMV slipped 2.5% to 128.5p.</p>",
  "<p>The slide in stock markets has accelerated after worse than expected US employment figures and a warning from the world's top mobile phone maker <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/nokia\">Nokia </a></strong>that weaker consumer confidence would hit its market share.</p> <p>The non-farm payrolls showed that 84,000 jobs were lost in August, compared to economists' expectations of a 75,000 fall. On top of that, the US government revised June and July's losses from 51,000 in both months to 60,000 and 100,000 respectively.</p> <p>This is the first time since 2002 that job numbers have fallen eight months in a row. The US unemployment rate jumped from 5.7% to 6.1%, its highest for more than four and a half years.</p> <p>Analysts believe the poor jobless numbers could prompt the US Federal Reserve to consider interest rate cuts.</p> <p>Rob Carnell of ING Bank said: \"It is worth bearing in mind that the Fed does care about the unemployment rate \u2013 a lot. At 6.5% [which ING believes is possible by the end of the year], all the arguments for continuing to do nothing with rates will start to sound rather hollow. </p> <p>\"And if payrolls continues to head lower as we head into 2009, and if the unemployment rate pushes higher towards 7.0% over the first half of 2009, then rate cuts are going to seem a much more obvious choice than they do to many in the markets today.\"</p> <p>As for Nokia, its gloomy statement compounded fears about the current global economic slowdown.</p> <p>The news pushed the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> 87.2 points lower to 5274.9, with the index on course for its worst weekly performance since 2002. </p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures, which had been around 39 points lower before the jobs data, are now showing a 112 point fall. This comes on top of yesterday's 345 point decline.</p>",
  "<p>Chinese shares slid to a 20-month low today, capping the sixth straight week of bad news for the troubled stockmarket.</p> <p>Markets across Asia fell in the wake of Wall Street's overnight plunge, but the decline in China reinforced pessimism among investors who have seen the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index fall by more than 63% from its October peak. </p> <p>It closed the day down 74.96 points, or 3.2%, at 2,202.45 and analysts have already warned it is likely to tumble further amid fears of an economic slowdown. It has declined by 8.13% this week alone.</p> <p>\"The recent continuous declines caused panic,\" said Zhu Kangping, a strategist at Shenyin Wanguo Securities in Shanghai. \"Today most securities shares slumped over 5% as investors feel hopeless about the market.\"</p> <p>In Shenzhen, the market fell 2.8%, or 209.4 points, to 7,264.2. Losses outnumbered gains by 827-47 in Shanghai and 702-32 in Shenzhen, with refiners, property firms and banks among the biggest losers.</p> <p>PetroChina, the Shanghai index's biggest traded share, fell 4.2% to 11.94 yuan while Sinopec, dropped 1.59% to 9.88 yuan.</p> <p>Analysts agree that the stockmarket was vastly overvalued last autumn as speculators piled in and that a correction was needed. But it has fallen further and faster than most anticipated, at a time when the Chinese economy faces a host of problems. </p> <p>While consumer inflation has fallen from a 12-year high this spring, producer price inflation has shot up - an additional headache for exporters struggling with the appreciation of the yuan and the global credit crunch. </p> <p>Some economists have called for tax cuts to boost growth despite government hopes that growth would fall back. Growth has run at 10.8% annually over the last five years.</p> <p>Earlier this week, Gao Lingzhi, strategist at Great Wall Securities, predicted that the index would fall to around 1,750 eventually, reflecting expectations that profit growth at listed companies might fall to zero next year from a forecast 16% this year.</p> <p>\"The index dropping is becoming a trend - the turnover drops, and prices drop, and the index drops,\" said Zhang Qi, analyst at Shanghai Haitong Securities.</p> <p>But he added: \"Being at 6000 points during October last year just wasn't sustainable, and these low prices imply that in the short term it might stay like this. </p> <p>\"But in three to five years there will be value for investment, as it is becoming closer to overseas markets.\"</p>",
  "<p>Jorg Brinkmann is that rare being, a jazz cellist. Some bass players (notably Dave Holland) have deployed the instrument on the side, but it's Brinkmann's principal voice that's featured in this recently emerged but already prizewinning trio alongside pianist and Fender Rhodes player Oliver Maas, and percussionist Dirk-Peter Kolsch. There are 18 short tracks here (a few under a minute) - from EST-like slow-burners, to sombre but accelerating waltzes, infectiously bright electric-funky sprints and mournful chamber-music ruminations. There are headlong, postbop uptempo swingers, with Brinkmann's cello performing a perfectly creditable bass-walk while Maas (who includes John Taylor and Uri Caine among his influences) streams imperiously into space. The atmospheric September draws evocatively from Brinkmann's classical roots, and the jaunty Live in Hamburg is like Frank Zappa with ska. This is a group from an environment we didn't expect to see for a long time yet - a post-EST world. But it's an honourable and very entertaining inheritor.</p>",
  "<p>A British university student who was injured after falling off a horse during a <a href=\"http://www.kamchatka2008.org.uk/index.htm\">biological research expedition</a> in a remote part of Russia has been airlifted out in a complex rescue mission.</p> <p>Kimberley Warren, 20, a second-year zoology student at Nottingham University, activated a rescue beacon after falling from the horse at around 10pm yesterday.</p> <p>The signal was received by the UK mission control centre of RAF Kinloss in Moray, Scotland, before being passed on to the Russian emergency services.</p> <p>A spokesman for the university said Warren had broken her leg.</p> <p>\"We can confirm it's Kimberley Warren and that she has been airlifted to the town of Esso,'' he said. \"She does have a broken leg but the injury is not remotely life-threatening.\"</p> <p>Warren, from Sway, Hampshire, was among a group of nine people in the Kamchatka nature park in eastern Russia who were on a two-month trip to examine the effects of global warming on natural habitats.</p> <p>It is understood the group had finished their fieldwork and were on an exploratory trip eastwards on horseback over mountains with a guide for a chance to see different vegetation. </p> <p>Flight Sergeant Tim Dickinson, the rescue coordinator at RAF Kinloss, said the UK mission control centre had received a signal from the beacon and looked up its owner on its database.</p> <p>\"The owner turned out to be one of the leaders of a Nottingham University group \u2026 in a very, very rural and remote part of Kamchatka where they are conducting biological research.</p> <p>\"We contacted a family member and then spoke to our Russian counterparts and they initiated a rescue.\"</p> <p>Warren will be transferred to a hospital in the larger town of Petro Pavlosk later today for further medical treatment.</p> <p>In a statement on the expedition's website this morning, the group said: \"We have been evacuated by helicopter to Esso village, where our casualty has been treated, and is now resting while we arrange to move them on to the hospital in the regional capital, Petropavlovsk.</p> <p>\"It's a relatively straightforward injury so we don't anticipate any complications and they should make a full recovery.

  "<p>The world's first complete demonstration of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology will begin next week at a coal-fired power station in Germany.</p> <p>Built alongside the 1,600MW Schwarze Pumpe power plant in north Germany, the demonstration experiment will capture up to 100,000 tonnes of CO2 a year, compress it and bury it 3,000m below the surface of the depleted Altmark gas field, about 200km from the site. </p> <p>The \u20ac70m (\u00a357m) project has an output of around 12MW of electricity and 30MW of thermal power, enough for more about 1,000 homes. </p> <p>The pilot plant will use an oxyfuel boiler, one of three types of CCS technology. This involves burning coal in an atmosphere of pure oxygen \u2013 the resulting waste gas is almost pure CO2 and this can be buried, preventing it from entering the atmosphere and contributing to global warming. The other CCS methods are pre-combustion, involving the removal of CO2 before burning by pre-treating the coal, and post-combustion, which scrubs the exhaust gases from a power station.</p> <p>\"It's a very important and tangible step forward,\" said Stuart Haszeldine, a geologist and CCS expert at the University of Edinburgh. \"It is the first full-chain demonstration of oxyfuel as a carbon capture technology. It connects all that for the first time in a working system.\" He added the Schwarze Pumpe pilot \"shows what can be done if the state and company are aligned and have confidence in each other\".</p> <p>CCS is seen as a potential solution to the projected increased use of coal in power stations around the world. At its best, it would trap up to 90% of a plant's carbon emissions and, though each element of the capture, transportation and storage process is already proven and in use, until now no one had demonstrated a full-cycle system, even at the small scale of a pilot. A full-scale system remains years away, largely because developing such a system is likely to be very expensive. As a result, many leading power companies have been reluctant to fund CCS individually, arguing that governments should also shoulder some of the financial risks.</p> <p>\"Coal, which represents 40-50% of electricity [generation], is necessary and will continue to be necessary because of fuel safety and accessibility. It is one of the most shared resources around the world,\" said Philippe Joubert, chief executive of Alstom, the company that built the specially equipped oxyfuel boiler for the Schwarze Pumpe's Swedish owners, Vatenfall. </p> <p>He said Alstom's research is aimed at keeping the world's options open on how electricity is generated in the coming decades. \"Coal has to be used but it has to be clean.\"</p> <p>The Schwarze Pumpe pilot, which will run for three years initially, is just one of several projects that are gearing up to demonstrate the full chain of CCS technology in the next few years. Alstom will commission another project of a similar size to Schwarze Pumpe later in 2008 at a power station in Lacq in southern France, in collaboration with the oil company Total.</p> <p>The Mountaineer project in West Virginia, US, due to begin in 2009, is likely to be the first of the pilot plants to put all the pieces of post-combustion CCS technology together. It is a testbed for a more ambitious plan to capture and store emissions from a coal-fired power station in Oklahoma which should begin operations early next decade, trapping and burying 1.5m tonnes of CO2 a year in a nearby oilfield. Vatenfall also has plans for a post-combustion pilot plant in Janshwalde in Germany - a 120MW coal-burning demonstration should become operational around 2013.</p> <p>In the UK, plans for a government-funded CCS demonstration plant are moving relatively slowly. In 2006, the government announced a competition to fund the construction of a 400MW CCS demonstration project that would go on line in 2014. Critics argue, however, that plans are too small-scale and too slow, despite government claims that the country is in a perfect place for CCS due to the easy access to suitable burial sites for CO2 in the North Sea. They also say that the government made a mistake in pre-selecting post-combustion technology as the only type of project it would fund. The government argues this is the only type of CCS that can be retrofitted.</p> <p>The decision on the UK's first CCS demonstration will be made in 2009, after the results of an ongoing consultation into how to implement the technology. Even some environmental groups have come together to recommend CCS as a way to reduce carbon emissions from the inevitable construction of coal-fired power stations in the UK and abroad. The EU has plans for 12 demonstration plants running by 2015.</p> <p>Haszledine said there are few excuses left for not starting CCS projects. \"There is no opposition to doing this [apart from] the lethargy of the UK government.\"</p>",

  "<p>The 2008 <a href=\"http://www.lambethconference.org/index.cfm\">Lambeth conference</a>, the once-a-decade gathering of bishops from around the Anglican communion, can best be described in two words: optimistic and troublesome. I have always believed that relationship building must be at the centre of all we do in the life of the Anglican communion, and this year's conference, which drew more than 650 bishops to Canterbury, provided a great opportunity for this to begin in a way that was not the case at the previous gathering. The non-legislative nature of this conference was in many ways a success.</p> <p>Each day began with a celebration of the holy eucharist hosted by one of the communion's provinces, followed by daily Bible study, then group discussions through the afternoon ranging from the role of bishops in the communion to the millennium development goals. Evening prayer was followed by presentations by the Archbishop of Canterbury and outside guests on topics such as evangelism, respectful dialogue, the environment, ecumenical and interfaith issues. All of this was mostly positive, and it gave me the opportunity to describe the polity of the <a href=\"http://www.episcopalchurch.org/\">episcopal church</a> to bishops from other provinces \u2013 how we are governed by the voices and votes of the laity, clergy and bishops and not by the solitary decision-making of the bishop or primate of the province. Some African bishops expressed wonderment that American bishops had very little decision-making and enforcement power and saw our system as difficult, if not unworkable. </p> <p>One bishop from Sudan came up to me after I spoke at a hearing on the <a href=\"http://www.anglicancommunion.org/windsor2004/index.cfm\">Windsor report</a> and apologised for his primate's position on human sexuality. He told me he had been threatened with losing his diocesan oversight if he attended the Lambeth conference. It was reassuring to me that many bishops, even those who do not share our understanding of human sexuality in the life of the church, said their disagreement with me and the episcopal church was not a \"breaking point\" in our relationship. Some said they knew that, in time, they would have to face the same issue in their own countries, and we all needed to have more conversation about human sexuality. All of these reflections, although problematic in some instances, were centered on an optimism that can hold us together as a communion if we continue to work at it and not remain in isolation from one another. </p> <p>What I found troubling was how the hearings on both the Windsor continuation study and the <a href=\"http://www.anglicancommunion.org/commission/index.cfm\">covenant</a> were finally presented by the Archbishop of Canterbury in his remarks towards the end of the conference. What was reported did not seem to capture the real flavour of what had been going on. I have always understood that politics plays a huge role in the decision-making of the communion \u2013 and the close of the Lambeth conference was a clear indication that politics trumped the power of conversation, reconciliation and hard work that so many bishops exerted in their time together.</p> <p>It is my opinion that in order to placate those primates and bishops who chose to absent themselves from the Lambeth conference and instead attended the <a href=\"http://www.gafcon.org/\">Gafcon</a> gathering in Jerusalem, and to quell the growing dissension within the Church of England over the recent decision to ordain women bishops, and the issues of human sexuality in holy orders, Archbishop Williams sought what he believed was a middle way \u2013 one which, unfortunately, continues to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/05/anglicanism.religion\">marginalise</a> the Canadian and American churches. There was far too much recognition of those who chose not to participate in this Lambeth conference and far too little recognition of those bishops who chose to come.</p> <p>I believe that this gathering had a great chance to move forward in relationship building, and to some extent, as I have mentioned earlier, it did. But when it came to addressing the pressing needs of the communion to develop a global Anglican strategy to address the issues of disease, poverty, illiteracy, the environment and state-sponsored violence against civilian populations, this conference succumbed to \"blaming the victims\". As in 1998, the victims are those whose sexual orientation happens to be different from the majority. Blaming the least among us continues to divert our attention away from the issues that threaten the very existence of humankind and the environmental health of our planet.</p> <p>The Archbishop of Canterbury has called for sacrifices to be made to keep the garment of the communion together. And for the American and Canadian churches, that clearly means sacrificing once again the full participation of gay and lesbian people in the life of our church. I, for one, will not ask for any more sacrifices to be made by persons in our church who have been made outcasts because of their sexual orientation.</p> <p>This Lambeth conference could have been a positive turning point for the Anglican communion, but instead the powers-that-be chose to seek a middle way that is neither \"the middle\" nor \"the way\". It will, therefore, be up to bishops from around the communion who have continuing partner and companion relationships to work toward a more holistic view of the church. The Anglican communion must face the hard truth that when we scapegoat and victimise one group of people in the church, all of us become victims of our own prejudice and sinfulness.</p> <p><em>This is an edited version of an article that first appeared on Episcopalian Caf\u00e9.

  "<p>George Monbiot <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/22/climatechange.kingsnorthclimatecamp\">risks</a> dismissing vital currents within the green movement when he reduces some radical climate justice politics as \"anarchism\".</p> <p>Movements advocating radical social change aren't simply \"anarchist\" or rooted in \"identity politics\": they are everywhere. Political organisation, particularly within a context of social peace, can be as much about judging boundaries and ruling out possibilities as it is about pushing the limits of debate about what is possible.</p> <p>Political activism when it takes place within established structures \u2013 does tend to perpetuate those structures, and the power relationships that inhabit and reproduce them. Sometimes these structures can be positive. But it can also reproduce definitions of the \"middle ground\", of \"balance\", \"realism\" and thereby set limits of acceptable debate. People living different and contradictory realities will inevitably reach different conclusions. Clashes and contradictions shouldn't come as a surprise.</p> <p>Many people today are living in conflict, and often paying the price of a violent life, in order to maintain our social peace. Many of them, despite living under an unbroken continuum of colonialism, engage in cooperative, participatory economies, and can reach very different conclusions about how to address climate change. They speak freely, openly and in detail about revolution and rejecting state solutions; they talk about fundamental social change as intrinsic in the fight for land, food, and cultural sovereignty, struggles that began centuries before climate change was accepted as a fact in the countries that first contributed to it, like Britain.</p> <p>These political currents have inspired many grassroots campaigners in the UK to take radical action, to oppose coal-fired power stations and airport expansion by creating the conditions for a community of resistance.</p> <p>The participatory politics glimpsed at the camp are already taking place all over the world, and are leading some of the most progressive initiatives \u2013 on ecological debt, on compensation for keeping fossil fuels in the ground, on creating explicitly anti-capitalist co-operative economies, and horizontal movements of farmers, peasants and the landless reclaiming land.</p> <p>This current runs through and informs the climate camps. It runs through the very tents, marquees, and kitchens that became spaces for debate and discussion. This current doesn't necessarily have spokespeople, a Guardian column or a seat at the table of Newsnight, but in the south it has nonetheless succeeded in toppling governments and booting out oil and mining companies from indigenous lands.</p> <p>It is also a diverse current. Here in the UK, many of those engaged in researching and lobbying, the filing of freedom of information requests, the petitioning, the parliamentary meetings and briefings with corporate and government representatives, also hold the view that fundamental, systemic changes are required. The two forms of political engagement and vision can and do co-exist. The same people who say \"I think we need revolutionary change\" also write advisory papers for politicians, attend cross-party meetings in Parliament and may also be stopping coal trains in their tracks.</p> <p>It is essential to keep probing the power relationships behind new technologies and green \"solutions\". We need to openly explore the power of the structures and social relationships that constitute \"the state\". This means questioning the uses of the state, and whether its structures, rather than having \"undemocratic tendencies\", are inherently flawed.</p> <p>This social justice-rooted line of enquiry and political current shouldn't be ignored. It certainly shouldn't be criticised as capable of \"melting the movement\". On the contrary: it is vital to keeping the movement vibrant and open and in touch with the struggles of those in the majority world.</p> <p>The green movement is a melting pot, a movement of movements. The \"we\" includes Monbiot, but also those who reject state-based solutions and capitalism and who are walking the talk in their activism and everyday lives. It includes those at the sharp end of new enclosures, taxes, desperate fossil fuel corporations, biofuel land grabs, desertification, starvation food prices, political despotism, water theft, military occupation, and industrial zone and sweat shop misery. It is a diverse and a global \"we\", and we are everywhere.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337321609\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>John McCain wrapped up the Republican convention tonight by reaching out beyond the party faithful to the independents who will determine in November whether he or Barack Obama is the next occupant of the White House.</p> <p>After formally accepting the Republican presidential nomination, he used his prime-time speech to try to steal from his Democratic rival the theme of change, a potent message in an election year in which voters are disillusioned with the George Bush presidency, the Iraq war and the state of the economy.</p> <p>\"Let me offer an advance warning to the old, big spending, do nothing, me first, country second Washington crowd: change is coming,\" he said.</p> <p>Warming to his theme of shaking up Washington, McCain appeared to borrow a phrase from the British prime minister John Major's last years in power saying he would take the Republican \"back to basics\".</p> <p>Touching on another theme popular with independents, he promised to end the \"constant partisan rancour\" that has left Washington so often deadlocked.</p> <p>McCain, the self-styled maverick who has so often angered his own party by bucking the party line, was given a five-minute standing ovation at the start of his 50-minute speech and again at the end, as confetti and 200,000 balloons floated from the ceiling, the traditional convention finish.</p> <p>But, a poor orator who has made few - if any - memorable speeches in the past, he failed to match either the rhetoric of Obama in Denver last week or even the feisty, sarcastic delivery of his own running mate, Sarah Palin.</p> <p>Some of the loudest cheers of the night were when Palin, the new darling of the Republican party, joined him at the end.</p> <p>Although the organisers said the theme of the day was \"peace,\" the tone of videos shown earlier in the night as well as in his speech and those of others was heavily militaristic. McCain devoted a large part of his speech to one of his biggest selling points, the period that turned him into an American hero, his five years in a Hanoi jail after his plane crashed on a bombing mission. As an admiral's son, he was offered the chance of early release but turned it down, refusing preferential treatment.</p> <p>The passage on his prison years, which seldom fails to resonate with Americans, earned him four standing ovations, to chants of \"USA, USA\".</p> <p>His time in jail, he said, turned him into a super-patriot. \"I fell in love with my country when I was a prisoner in someone else's \u2026 I was never the same again. I wasn't my own man anymore. I was my country's.\" </p> <p>The speech was a high point for McCain, aged 72, who was watched by his mother, Roberta, aged 96, and comes a year after he almost had to pull out of the Republican nomination with his campaign close to bankruptcy.</p> <p>McCain, ignoring the sustained personal - and frequently misleading - attacks on Obama at the convention, chose to present himself as above such tactics, saying he admired his Democratic rival for his achievement in winning his party's nomination. \"Despite our differences, much more unites us than divides us,\" he said, to applause. \"We are fellow Americans, an association that means more to me than any other.\"</p> <p>McCain, aware of his limitations as a speaker, attempted to recreate the intimacy of the townhall meetings with which he is more comfortable by placing the podium in the middle of the audience, but it was a failed experiment, with his delivery as deadening as ever.</p> <p>The start of his speech was briefly marred by protesters, including one from military veterans opposed to him. </p> <p>He used the convention to try to win over the millions watching at home with his promise of a bipartisan approach to politics, saying he had a proven record of working with Democrats in the Senate, often in the face of anger from fellow Republicans. \"I have the record and the scars to prove it. Senator Obama does not,\" McCain said.</p> <p>He is friends with many Democratic senators and has sponsored various bipartisan initiatives in the Senate, including a bill to ease illegal immigration along with the Democrat Ted Kennedy, angering Republicans.</p> <p>Forseeing a McCain presidency he said: \"I will ask Democrats and Independents to serve with me. And my administration will set a new standard for transparency and accountability.\"</p> <p>But pointing to other differences with the Democratic nominee, he said there was a gap between them on tax cuts, foreign policy - particularly Iraq - and drilling for oil in US waters. </p> <p>He issued a warning to Russia over the conflict in Georgia. \"We can't turn a blind eye to aggression and international lawlessness that threatens the peace and stability of the world and the security of the American people,\" he said.</p> <p>One of the loudest ovations he received all night was when he spoke about Palin. \"I can't wait until I introduce her to Washington. And let me offer an advance warning to the old, big spending, do nothing, me first, country second Washington crowd: change is coming,\" McCain said.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337321609\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>Thank you all very much. Tonight, I have a privilege given few Americans - the privilege of accepting our party's nomination for president of the United States. And I accept it with gratitude, humility and confidence. </p> <p>In my life, no success has come without a good fight, and this nomination wasn't any different. That's a tribute to the candidates who opposed me and their supporters. They're leaders of great ability, who love our country, and wished to lead it to better days. Their support is an honour I won't forget. </p> <p>I'm grateful to the president for leading us in those dark days following the worst attack on American soil in our history, and keeping us safe from another attack many thought was inevitable; and to the first lady, Laura Bush, a model of grace and kindness in public and in private. And I'm grateful to the 41st president and his bride of 63 years, and for their outstanding example of honourable service to our country. </p> <p>As always, I'm indebted to my wife, Cindy, and my seven children. The pleasures of family life can seem like a brief holiday from the crowded calendar of our nation's business. But I have treasured them all the more, and can't imagine a life without the happiness you give me. Cindy said a lot of nice things about me tonight. But, in truth, she's more my inspiration than I am hers. Her concern for those less blessed than we are - victims of landmines, children born in poverty and with birth defects - shows the measure of her humanity. I know she will make a great first lady. </p> <p>When I was growing up, my father was often at sea, and the job of raising my brother, sister and me would fall to my mother alone. Roberta McCain gave us her love of life, her deep interest in the world, her strength and her belief we are all meant to use our opportunities to make ourselves useful to our country. I wouldn't be here tonight but for the strength of her character. </p> <p>My heartfelt thanks to all of you, who helped me win this nomination, and stood by me when the odds were long. I won't let you down. To Americans who have yet to decide who to vote for, thank you for your consideration and the opportunity to win your trust. I intend to earn it. </p> <p>Finally, a word to Senator Obama and his supporters. We'll go at it over the next two months. That's the nature of these contests, and there are big differences between us. But you have my respect and admiration. Despite our differences, much more unites us than divides us. We are fellow Americans, an association that means more to me than any other. We're dedicated to the proposition that all people are created equal and endowed by our Creator with inalienable rights. No country ever had a greater cause than that. And I wouldn't be an American worthy of the name if I didn't honour Senator Obama and his supporters for their achievement. </p> <p>But let there be no doubt, my friends, we're going to win this election. And after we've won, we're going to reach out our hand to any willing patriot, make this government start working for you again, and get this country back on the road to prosperity and peace. </p> <p>These are tough times for many of you. You're worried about keeping your job or finding a new one, and are struggling to put food on the table and stay in your home. All you ever asked of government is to stand on your side, not in your way. And that's just what I intend to do: stand on your side and fight for your future. </p> <p>And I've found just the right partner to help me shake up Washington, governor Sarah Palin of Alaska. She has executive experience and a real record of accomplishment. She's tackled tough problems like energy independence and corruption. She's balanced a budget, cut taxes and taken on the special interests. She's reached across the aisle and asked Republicans, Democrats and Independents to serve in her administration. She's the mother of five children. She's helped run a small business, worked with her hands and knows what it's like to worry about mortgage payments and healthcare and the cost of gasoline and groceries. </p> <p>She knows where she comes from and she knows who she works for. She stands up for what's right, and she doesn't let anyone tell her to sit down. I'm very proud to have introduced our next vice-president to the country. But I can't wait until I introduce her to Washington. And let me offer an advance warning to the old, big spending, do nothing, me first, country second Washington crowd: change is coming. </p> <p>I'm not in the habit of breaking promises to my country and neither is Governor Palin. And when we tell you we're going to change Washington, and stop leaving our country's problems for some unluckier generation to fix, you can count on it. We've got a record of doing just that, and the strength, experience, judgment and backbone to keep our word to you. </p> <p>You know, I've been called a maverick; someone who marches to the beat of his own drum. Sometimes it's meant as a compliment and sometimes it's not. What it really means is I understand who I work for. I don't work for a party. I don't work for a special interest. I don't work for myself. I work for you. </p> <p>I've fought corruption, and it didn't matter if the culprits were Democrats or Republicans. They violated their public trust, and had to be held accountable. I've fought big spenders in both parties, who waste your money on things you neither need nor want, while you struggle to buy groceries, fill your gas tank and make your mortgage payment. I've fought to get million dollar checks out of our elections. I've fought lobbyists who stole from Indian tribes. I fought crooked deals in the Pentagon. I fought tobacco companies and trial lawyers, drug companies and union bosses. </p> <p>I fought for the right strategy and more troops in Iraq, when it wasn't a popular thing to do. And when the pundits said my campaign was finished, I said I'd rather lose an election than see my country lose a war. </p> <p>Thanks to the leadership of a brilliant general, David Petraeus, and the brave men and women he has the honour to command, that strategy succeeded and rescued us from a defeat that would have demoralised our military, risked a wider war and threatened the security of all Americans. </p> <p>I don't mind a good fight. For reasons known only to God, I've had quite a few tough ones in my life. But I learned an important lesson along the way. In the end, it matters less that you can fight. What you fight for is the real test. </p> <p>I fight for Americans. I fight for you. I fight for Bill and Sue Nebe from Farmington Hills, Michigan, who lost their real-estate investments in the bad housing market. Bill got a temporary job after he was out of work for seven months. Sue works three jobs to help pay the bills. </p> <p>I fight for Jake and Toni Wimmer of Franklin County, Pennsylvania. Jake works on a loading dock; coaches Little League, and raises money for the mentally and physically disabled. Toni is a schoolteacher, working toward her master's degree. They have two sons, the youngest, Luke, has been diagnosed with autism. Their lives should matter to the people they elect to office. They matter to me. </p> <p>I fight for the family of Matthew Stanley of Wolfboro, New Hampshire, who died serving our country in Iraq. I wear his bracelet and think of him every day. I intend to honour their sacrifice by making sure the country their son loved so well and never returned to, remains safe from its enemies. </p> <p>I fight to restore the pride and principles of our party. We were elected to change Washington, and we let Washington change us. We lost the trust of the American people when some Republicans gave in to the temptations of corruption. We lost their trust when rather than reform government, both parties made it bigger. We lost their trust when instead of freeing ourselves from a dangerous dependence on foreign oil, both parties and Senator Obama passed another corporate welfare bill for oil companies. We lost their trust, when we valued our power over our principles. </p> <p>We're going to change that. We're going to recover the people's trust by standing up again for the values Americans admire. The party of Lincoln, Roosevelt and Reagan is going to get back to basics. </p> <p>We believe everyone has something to contribute and deserves the opportunity to reach their God-given potential from the boy whose descendents arrived on the Mayflower to the Latina daughter of migrant workers. We're all God's children and we're all Americans. </p> <p>We believe in low taxes; spending discipline, and open markets. We believe in rewarding hard work and risk takers and letting people keep the fruits of their labor. </p> <p>We believe in a strong defense, work, faith, service, a culture of life, personal responsibility, the rule of law and judges who dispense justice impartially and don't legislate from the bench. We believe in the values of families, neighborhoods and communities. </p> <p>We believe in a government that unleashes the creativity and initiative of Americans. Government that doesn't make your choices for you, but works to make sure you have more choices to make for yourself. </p> <p>I will keep taxes low and cut them where I can. My opponent will raise them. I will open new markets to our goods and services. My opponent will close them. I will cut government spending. He will increase it. </p> <p>My tax cuts will create jobs. His tax increases will eliminate them. My healthcare plan will make it easier for more Americans to find and keep good healthcare insurance. His plan will force small businesses to cut jobs, reduce wages and force families into a government-run healthcare system where a bureaucrat stands between you and your doctor. </p> <p>Keeping taxes low helps small businesses grow and create new jobs. Cutting the second-highest business tax rate in the world will help American companies compete and keep jobs from moving overseas. Doubling the child tax exemption from $3500 to $7000 will improve the lives of millions of American families. Reducing government spending and getting rid of failed programs will let you keep more of your own money to save, spend and invest as you see fit. Opening new markets and preparing workers to compete in the world economy is essential to our future prosperity. </p> <p>I know some of you have been left behind in the changing economy and it often seems your government hasn't even noticed. Government assistance for unemployed workers was designed for the economy of the 1950s. That's going to change on my watch. My opponent promises to bring back old jobs by wishing away the global economy. We're going to help workers who've lost a job that won't come back, find a new one that won't go away. </p> <p>We will prepare them for the jobs of today. We will use our community colleges to help train people for new opportunities in their communities. For workers in industries that have been hard hit, we'll help make up part of the difference in wages between their old job and a temporary, lower paid one while they receive retraining that will help them find secure new employment at a decent wage. </p> <p>Education is the civil rights issue of this century. Equal access to public education has been gained. But what is the value of access to a failing school? We need to shake up failed school bureaucracies with competition, empower parents with choice, remove barriers to qualified instructors, attract and reward good teachers and help bad teachers find another line of work. </p> <p>When a public school fails to meet its obligations to students, parents deserve a choice in the education of their children. And I intend to give it to them. Some may choose a better public school. Some may choose a private one. Many will choose a charter school. But they will have that choice and their children will have that opportunity. </p> <p>Senator Obama wants our schools to answer to unions and entrenched bureaucracies. I want schools to answer to parents and students. And when I'm president, they will. </p> <p>My fellow Americans, when I'm president, we're going to embark on the most ambitious national project in decades. We are going to stop sending $700bn a year to countries that don't like us very much. We will attack the problem on every front. We will produce more energy at home. We will drill new wells offshore, and we'll drill them now. We will build more nuclear power plants. We will develop clean coal technology. We will increase the use of wind, tide, solar and natural gas. We will encourage the development and use of flex fuel, hybrid and electric automobiles. </p> <p>Senator Obama thinks we can achieve energy independence without more drilling and without more nuclear power. But Americans know better than that. We must use all resources and develop all technologies necessary to rescue our economy from the damage caused by rising oil prices and to restore the health of our planet. It's an ambitious plan, but Americans are ambitious by nature, and we have faced greater challenges. It's time for us to show the world again how Americans lead. </p> <p>This great national cause will create millions of new jobs, many in industries that will be the engine of our future prosperity; jobs that will be there when your children enter the workforce. </p> <p>Today, the prospect of a better world remains within our reach. But we must see the threats to peace and liberty in our time clearly and face them, as Americans before us did, with confidence, wisdom and resolve. </p> <p>We have dealt a serious blow to al-Qaida in recent years. But they are not defeated, and they'll strike us again if they can. Iran remains the chief state sponsor of terrorism and on the path to acquiring nuclear weapons. Russia's leaders, rich with oil wealth and corrupt with power, have rejected democratic ideals and the obligations of a responsible power. They invaded a small, democratic neighbor to gain more control over the world's oil supply, intimidate other neighbours, and further their ambitions of reassembling the Russian empire. And the brave people of Georgia need our solidarity and prayers. As president, I will work to establish good relations with Russia so we need not fear a return of the cold war. But we can't turn a blind eye to aggression and international lawlessness that threatens the peace and stability of the world and the security of the American people. </p> <p>We face many threats in this dangerous world, but I'm not afraid of them. I'm prepared for them. I know how the military works, what it can do, what it can do better and what it should not do. I know how the world works. I know the good and the evil in it. I know how to work with leaders who share our dreams of a freer, safer and more prosperous world, and how to stand up to those who don't. I know how to secure the peace. </p> <p>When I was five years old, a car pulled up in front of our house. A Navy officer rolled down the window, and shouted at my father that the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor. I rarely saw my father again for four years. My grandfather came home from that same war exhausted from the burdens he had borne, and died the next day. In Vietnam, where I formed the closest friendships of my life, some of those friends never came home with me. I hate war. It is terrible beyond imagination. </p> <p>I'm running for president to keep the country I love safe, and prevent other families from risking their loved ones in war as my family has. I will draw on all my experience with the world and its leaders, and all the tools at our disposal - diplomatic, economic, military and the power of our ideals - to build the foundations for a stable and enduring peace. </p> <p>In America, we change things that need to be changed. Each generation makes its contribution to our greatness. The work that is ours to do is plainly before us. We don't need to search for it. </p> <p>We need to change the way government does almost everything: from the way we protect our security to the way we compete in the world economy; from the way we respond to disasters to the way we fuel our transportation network; from the way we train our workers to the way we educate our children. All these functions of government were designed before the rise of the global economy, the information technology revolution and the end of the cold war. We have to catch up to history, and we have to change the way we do business in Washington. </p> <p>The constant partisan rancour that stops us from solving these problems isn't a cause, it's a symptom. It's what happens when people go to Washington to work for themselves and not you. </p> <p>Again and again, I've worked with members of both parties to fix problems that need to be fixed. That's how I will govern as president. I will reach out my hand to anyone to help me get this country moving again. I have that record and the scars to prove it. Senator Obama does not. </p> <p>Instead of rejecting good ideas because we didn't think of them first, let's use the best ideas from both sides. Instead of fighting over who gets the credit, let's try sharing it. This amazing country can do anything we put our minds to. I will ask Democrats and Independents to serve with me. And my administration will set a new standard for transparency and accountability. </p> <p>We're going to finally start getting things done for the people who are counting on us, and I won't care who gets the credit. </p> <p>I've been an imperfect servant of my country for many years. But I have been her servant first, last and always. And I've never lived a day, in good times or bad, that I didn't thank God for the privilege. </p> <p>Long ago, something unusual happened to me that taught me the most valuable lesson of my life. I was blessed by misfortune. I mean that sincerely. I was blessed because I served in the company of heroes, and I witnessed a thousand acts of courage, compassion and love. </p> <p>On an October morning, in the Gulf of Tonkin, I prepared for my 23rd mission over North Vietnam. I hadn't any worry I wouldn't come back safe and sound. I thought I was tougher than anyone. I was pretty independent then, too. I liked to bend a few rules, and pick a few fights for the fun of it. But I did it for my own pleasure; my own pride. I didn't think there was a cause more important than me. </p> <p>Then I found myself falling toward the middle of a small lake in the city of Hanoi, with two broken arms, a broken leg, and an angry crowd waiting to greet me. I was dumped in a dark cell, and left to die. I didn't feel so tough anymore. When they discovered my father was an admiral, they took me to a hospital. They couldn't set my bones properly, so they just slapped a cast on me. When I didn't get better, and was down to about a hundred pounds, they put me in a cell with two other Americans. I couldn't do anything. I couldn't even feed myself. They did it for me. I was beginning to learn the limits of my selfish independence. Those men saved my life. </p> <p>I was in solitary confinement when my captors offered to release me. I knew why. If I went home, they would use it as propaganda to demoralise my fellow prisoners. Our code said we could only go home in the order of our capture, and there were men who had been shot down before me. I thought about it, though. I wasn't in great shape, and I missed everything about America. But I turned it down. </p> <p>A lot of prisoners had it worse than I did. I'd been mistreated before, but not as badly as others. I always liked to strut a little after I'd been roughed up to show the other guys I was tough enough to take it. But after I turned down their offer, they worked me over harder than they ever had before. For a long time. And they broke me. </p> <p>When they brought me back to my cell, I was hurt and ashamed, and I didn't know how I could face my fellow prisoners. The good man in the cell next door, my friend, Bob Craner, saved me. Through taps on a wall he told me I had fought as hard as I could. No man can always stand alone. And then he told me to get back up and fight again for our country and for the men I had the honour to serve with. Because every day they fought for me. </p> <p>I fell in love with my country when I was a prisoner in someone else's. I loved it not just for the many comforts of life here. I loved it for its decency; for its faith in the wisdom, justice and goodness of its people. I loved it because it was not just a place, but an idea, a cause worth fighting for. I was never the same again. I wasn't my own man anymore. I was my country's. </p> <p>I'm not running for president because I think I'm blessed with such personal greatness that history has anointed me to save our country in its hour of need. My country saved me. My country saved me, and I cannot forget it. And I will fight for her for as long as I draw breath, so help me God. </p> <p>If you find faults with our country, make it a better one. If you're disappointed with the mistakes of government, join its ranks and work to correct them. Enlist in our armed forces. Become a teacher. Enter the ministry. Run for public office. Feed a hungry child. Teach an illiterate adult to read. Comfort the afflicted. Defend the rights of the oppressed. Our country will be the better, and you will be the happier. Because nothing brings greater happiness in life than to serve a cause greater than yourself. </p> <p>I'm going to fight for my cause every day as your president. I'm going to fight to make sure every American has every reason to thank God, as I thank Him: that I'm an American, a proud citizen of the greatest country on earth, and with hard work, strong faith and a little courage, great things are always within our reach. Fight with me. Fight with me. </p> <p>Fight for what's right for our country. </p> <p>Fight for the ideals and character of a free people. </p> <p>Fight for our children's future. </p> <p>Fight for justice and opportunity for all. </p> <p>Stand up to defend our country from its enemies. </p> <p>Stand up for each other; for beautiful, blessed, bountiful America. </p> <p>Stand up, stand up, stand up and fight. Nothing is inevitable here. We're Americans, and we never give up. We never quit. We never hide from history. We make history. </p> <p>Thank you, and God bless you.</p>",

(Scroll down for photograph.) Shortly, we'll hear what's surely the most important speech of John McCain's life \u2014 the one for which his whole political career has been a preparation. Liveblogging starts now.</p> <p><strong>8.45pm (all times local)</strong>: Cindy McCain is wowing the crowd with a speech about McCain as loving father, war hero, fantastic husband and war hero. \"We love Cindy!\" read the banners held aloft by the crowd. Now she's singing the praises of \"hockey mom, basketball shootin', moose-huntin', fly-fishin', pistol-packing mother of five for vice president.\" Her delivery's fairly wooden, but it's doing the trick. Cindy McCain is an exceedingly savvy businesswoman who keeps John McCain in ready money, and her global charity work is hugely impressive. But she's not a public speaker. Then again, neither is John McCain, usually.</p> <p>\"I think John was a hero in Vietnam!\" Shall we play wartime-references bingo? First one to spot 40 of them tonight wins a prize. Cindy's got to keep going, because the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/03/AR2008090303255.html?hpid=topnews\">football hasn't finished yet</a>. </p> <p><strong>8.50pm</strong>: I was racing from location to location when the video tribute to Cindy McCain was showing, so I didn't feel justified in being snarky about it.

Chris Cilizza is presumably right that McCain is going to talk in much more detail about the incredible hardships he suffered as a prisoner of war, which is probably going to make me feel guilty for joking about how often he mentions it. The other key points: he needs to focus on the economy, and banish the perception he's out of touch with ordinary, financially stretched Americans. And a crucial question: how far he'll distance himself from George Bush, and how the crowd in the hall will respond, because it'll indicate how far Bush-loving conservatives have truly jumped on board the McCain bandwagon.</p> <p><strong>8.59pm</strong>: Warning: Republicans dancing! Or shuffling to left and then to the right, in an embarrassing, socially conservative way. It's not pleasant, even though Johnny B Goode is a very good tune. </p> <p><strong>9.03pm</strong>: OK please stop now.</p> <p>Time for a photograph of the crazy new podium, which I took a few minutes ago during the video tribute to Cindy McCain: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337320632\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/9/5/1220580519340/hall.jpg\" alt=\"Convention hall\" width=\"459\" height=\"313\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>9.05pm</strong>: John McCain video tribute time! He was a POW. No, <em>for real</em>. This is beyond parody, I'm afraid, so don't expect any parody from me. Now a man with a syrupy voice, like the guy on the cinema trailers, is essentially saying that America would have to be discontinued entirely if it weren't fortunate to have McCain running for president in these terrible times. (Oh! I'm told it's Fred Thompson.)</p> <p><strong>9.15pm</strong>: And here he is, in a scary halo of light, as if he were a Celebrity, or the Messiah. Much crowd applause, but it's not on the Palin level.</p> <p><strong>9.20pm</strong>: He's got a <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/06/03/the-lime-green-monster-mc_n_105044.html\">green screen behind him again</a>! That's a disastrous choice. He accepts the nomination and careens straight in to some Bush love. \"I'm grateful to the President for leading us in those dark days following the worst attack on American soil in our history, and keeping us safe from another attack many thought was inevitable.\" He thanks his wife, his mother, Americans, everyone. </p> <p>\"Finally, a word to Senator Obama and his supporters. We'll go at it over the next two months. That's the nature of these contests, and there are big differences between us. But you have my respect and admiration.\" Not Sarah Palin's, though. She thinks you are ridiculous, Obama, and she will mock you for having been a community organiser, and throw moose-antlers in your way to trip you up.</p> <p><strong>9.24pm</strong>: \"I wouldn't be an American worthy of the name if I didn't honor Senator Obama and his supporters for their achievement. But let there be no doubt, my friends, we're going to win this election.\" Oh, all right, that's the bipartisanship over with. </p> <p><strong>9.26pm</strong>: A serious commotion, as two Code Pink-looking protestors reveal themselves, flash peace signs, and get dragged out by security, thereby amping the crowd up by about 100%. They're almost as loud as they were for Palin yesterday now. Well done Code Pink! Or Republican operatives in disguise, if that's what you really are.</p> <p>McCain chuckles in his trademark sinister fashion and picks up the thread again, which is about how he understands that times are tough. He promises to \"stand on your side\", which sounds painful.</p> <p><strong>9.28pm</strong>: Praising Palin. \"She's helped run a small business, worked with her hands and nose...\" He ACTUALLY PAUSES HERE. Her nose? Oh, I see: \"...Worked with her hands and knows what it's like to worry about mortgage payments and health care and the cost of gasoline and groceries.\" I seriously thought he was going to give us an Eskimo joke then.</p> <p><strong>9.31pm</strong>: He's happy to have introduced Palin to the country, but he can't wait to introduce her to Washington. She and he are maverick reformer mavericks, who will completely maverick the place up when they get there, \"there\" being, of course, the place McCain has been for many years.</p> <p><strong>9.34pm</strong>: Now he's taking credit for the surge in Iraq. \"I don't mind a good fight. For reasons known only to God, I've had quite a few tough ones in my life.\"</p> <p>\"I fight for Americans. I fight for you. I fight for Bill and Sue Nebe from Farmington Hills, Michigan, who lost their real estate investments in the bad housing market, so I let them live in one of my spare houses.\" Actually I made that last part up. He works for other ordinary Americans too, including a soldier who died in Iraq, whose bracelet he wears every day. </p> <p><strong>9.37pm</strong>: \"I fight to restore the pride and principles of our party. We were elected to change Washington, and we let Washington change us. We lost the trust of the American people when some Republicans gave in to the temptations of corruption...\" He's talking about how \"both parties\" made government bigger and gave in to oil dependency \u2014 the crowd is silent. Silent. They're uneasy about this, I think. Bit too maverick. Then he vows to \"change that,\" and they're back cheering again. </p> <p><strong>9.40pm</strong>: Things \"we\" believe in: low taxes, open markets, \"a culture of life\", faith, work, service, and THE RULE OF LAW. And now it's call-and-response time: \"I will keep taxes low, my opponent will raise them.\" (\"Boo!\") \"I will open new markets to our goods and services. My opponent will close them. I will cut government spending. He will increase it.\" Obama's healthcare plan will force you to use a system where \"a bureaucrat stands between you and your doctor.\" Biggest boos yet. Bureaucrats! Imagine.</p> <p><strong>9.45pm</strong>: Choice in schools. Choice in schools. No bureaucrats, just choice, lovely choice.</p> <p><strong>9.46pm</strong>: \"My fellow Americans, when I'm President, we're going to embark on the most ambitious national project in decades.\" NOT THE LADDER TO SPACE?!! Seriously?? All right. This is going to be cool. John McCain is going to build a ladder to space.</p> <p>Oh, hang on, it's energy independence.</p> <p>\"We are going to stop sending $700 billion a year to countries that don't like us very much. We will attack the problem on every front. We will produce more energy at home. We will drill new wells offshore, and we'll drill them now.\" Drill, drill. \"Drill baby drill!\" the crowd shout, troublingly. </p> <p><strong>9.49pm</strong>: Terrorism time. Al Qaeda still poses a threat, and so does Russia. We must support the Georgians. \"We can't turn a blind eye to aggression and international lawlessness that threatens the peace and stability of the world and the security of the American people.\" There are lots of threats in this dangerous world and we should all be very scared, but John McCain isn't scared. He will fight.</p> <p>\"I know how the world works. I know the good and the evil in it. I know how to work with leaders who share our dreams of a freer, safer and more prosperous world, and how to stand up to those who don't.\" Feel the experience!</p> <p><strong>9.52pm</strong>: Wartime experiences, but not in much detail, and, by McCain standards, really not overplayed at all, nicely done. That can't be it, surely...?</p> <p><strong>9.54pm</strong>: \"The work that is ours to do is plainly before us. We don't need to search for it.\" Not like Barack Obama, who has read too many self-help books and is on a journey of personal discovery.</p> <p>\"I have that record [of experience], and the scars to prove it. Senator Obama does not.\"</p> <p><strong>9.57pm</strong>: \"Long ago, something unusual happened to me that taught me the most valuable lesson of my life. I was blessed by misfortune. I mean that sincerely. I was blessed because I served in the company of heroes...\" Ah, OK, that part before wasn't all there was. After a bit on accountability and bipartisanship, we're into the details of his prisoner-of-war experiences. He'd been a selfish young man, but when he was dumped in a dark cell in Hanoi and left to die.\" Crowd is yelling, weeping. McCain is going into detail about the violence he suffered in captivity.</p> <p><strong>10.01pm</strong>: \"When they brought me back to my cell, I was hurt and ashamed, and I didn't know how I could face my fellow prisoners. The good man in the cell next door, my friend, Bob Craner, saved me. Through taps on a wall he told me I had fought as hard as I could. No man can always stand alone. And then he told me to get back up and fight again for our country and for the men I had the honor to serve with.\" Powerful stuff; standing ovations from the crowd.</p> <p><strong>10.04pm</strong>: \"I'm not running for president because I think I'm blessed with such personal greatness that history has anointed me to save our country in its hour of need. My country saved me. My country saved me, and I cannot forget it.\" Anti-Obama, obviously.</p> <p>He's urging everyone to do public service, instead -- implicitly -- of whining about hope and change. Nothing brings greater happiness than serving a cause greater than yourself, eg., Getting John McCain Elected. \"I'm going to fight for my cause every day as your president. I'm going to fight to make sure every American has every reason to thank God, as I thank him: that I'm an American, a proud citizen of the greatest country on earth, and with hard work, strong faith and a little courage, great things are always within our reach. Fight with me. Fight with me.\" Fight fight fight!</p> <p>Fight for what's right! Fight for America! Stand up to defend America! Stand up! Fight! </p> <p>...And it's over. Wow, that was fighty, the end part.</p> <p><strong>10.07pm</strong>: Here's Cindy and John and the moosehunter, doing some Hillary Pointing. </p> <p><strong>10.09pm</strong> BALLOONS! I like balloons. Balloons are the whole point of American political conventions. The elitist Barack Obama didn't have any balloons, because he considered himself to be above them, and also because Invesco Field didn't have a roof, so a balloon drop was unfeasible. But maverick John McCain gives you balloons. (Two hundred thousand of them, apparently.) Balloons and confetti. Vote for John McCain, balloon maverick. </p> <p>They're playing Rhythm Is A Dancer now. Rhythm may be a dancer, but the Michigan delegation are not. </p> <p>Raising McCain. That song again.</p> <p><strong>10.25pm</strong> Well, that was underwhelming and underpowered. (Apart from the balloons.) I thought it was telling that he seemed only to be able to rouse the crowd to emotion by explicitly chanting \"fight!\", \"fight!\". The distancing-from-Bush part, and the attack on the party, really didn't seem to go down well. He was light on policy, and not \u2014 I thought, though it's a very personal thing \u2014&#xa0;particularly warm or personable at all. Will tonight's performance drain some of the Palinthusiasm from the party faithful? We'll have to see.</p> <p><a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/213710.php\">TPM:</a> \"I'm insulted that McCain uses a lifeless speech to hide his lack of specific policy proposals.\"<br><a href=\"http://www.time-blog.com/swampland/2008/09/the_speech_2.html\">Swampland:</a> \"Mixed performance\" \u2014 Jay Carney also notes how much more excited and powerful McCain is when he's talking about something that excites him, namely, fighting.</p> <p>They're playing <a href=\"http://www.lyricsdownload.com/sly-and-the-family-stone-everyday-people-lyrics.html\">Everyday People</a>, now. Anti-elitist music.</p> <p><strong>10.31pm</strong>: <a href=\"http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/tapped_archive?month=09&amp;year=2008&amp;base_name=interview_with_mccain_heckler\">An interview</a> with one of the protestors dragged from the hall, who turns out to be a Ron Paul supporter.</p> <p>...My colleague Richard Adams points out a significant quotation I missed in the frenzy of liveblogging \u2014&#xa0;a line that might not please immigration-hardliner Republicans: \"We believe everyone has something to contribute and deserves the opportunity to reach their God-given potential from the boy whose descendents arrived on the Mayflower to the Latina daughter of migrant workers. We're all God's children and we're all Americans.\"</p> <p>I also failed to notice his reference earlier to how the party of Lincoln, Roosevelt and Reagan \"is going to get back to basics.\" This reference <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_Basics_(campaign)\">sits ill with Brits</a>...</p> <p>Right, off to talk to delegates now.</p> <p>====</p> <p>POSTSCRIPT</p> <p><strong>11.15pm</strong>: Interesting... With the caveat that this means nothing at all, I just spent a few moments mingling with delegates and their guests streaming out of the convention hall, and the contrast with last night couldn't be much starker. They weren't pumped up at all; almost everyone to whom I spoke felt the need to offer some kind of apology or justification for McCain's poor performance tonight. </p> <p>The very first person I stopped, Jerrod Atkinson from Dallas \u2014 a guest of the Texas delegation, not a delegate himself \u2014 said: \"Terrible. It was just full of emptiness, and what I see as empty promises. Any time I saw a stance, it wasn't a Republican stance. I really, really liked Sarah Palin's speech. I kinda wish we could have reversed the ticket: Palin/McCain. But apparently it's too late for that...\"</p> <p>But to be fair, he was the exception: everyone else delivered some kind of praise. \"I thought it communicated the essence of John McCain: he's sincere, and he's dedicated,\" said Karen Pausman, a Texas delegate (in regulation Stars-and-Stripes shirt and cowboy hat). She'd been impressed with McCain's remarks on energy policy. \"He never has been a strong speaker, but he had a lot of content. He has the gravitas to say I've put my money where my mouth is for my country.\" Which was better, McCain's speech, or Palin's? \"Palin's a better \u2014 I'm thinking of the right word \u2014 Palin's a better entertainer,\" she said. </p> <p>Paul Kramer, also a Texas delegate: \"He addressed the one thing we're concerned with most, which is our safety as Americans in the world. That's what's most important to us. We're facing a group that's set on our destruction as much as Adolf Hitler was.\" </p> <p>Fred Radewagen, a Hawaiian delegate, on the contrast between Palin and McCain: \"You can't compare apples and oranges.\"</p> <p>====</p> <p><strong>11.25pm</strong> Here endeth the liveblogging of the 2008 Democratic and Republican conventions. Tomorrow I'll fly back to elitist Washington, DC to sip on elitist coffee drinks. My regular Campaign Diary <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/burkeman/\">blog</a> continues. And of course there'll be more liveblogging at the debates. Or perhaps before. Thanks for reading and commenting. Now I must sleep.</p>"
