  "<p>If it wasn't for the teenagers casually hovering outside the building where Shauneen Lambe works in west London, it would look like any anonymous law office on any high street in the country. Inside, there is a constant hubbub generated by the stream of youngsters drifting in and out. Lambe, whose charity provides legal assistance and general support to disadvantaged and excluded young people, accepts that it's an unconventional set-up. \"I absolutely love all the kids I work with,\" she says. \"Sometimes, they'll drive me crazy. These kids are intimidating to the world. But they are entertaining and they are brilliant. Every day the kids come in and I think: 'Yeah, that's what I like.'\"</p> <p>Many of the children she works with are in dire circumstances. Talking about why she and her colleague, Aika Stephenson, started up Just For Kids (JfK) in 2006, her conversation is littered with tragic individual stories, tales of political indifference or meddling, and shocking examples of the mistreatment of young people caught up in the criminal justice system.</p> <p>Lambe speaks calmly, but her frustrations are implicit in everything she describes. The case of one of her most recent clients, known as \"AC\", illustrates, she says, much of what is fundamentally wrong with the youth justice system and why it often exacerbates the problems it is supposed to be allaying. AC had no record of criminal behaviour when he was sent to Oakhill secure training centre (STC), aged 14, in May last year after being wrongly charged (he was later exonerated) with grievous bodily harm. While in Oakhill, he was assaulted by an inmate. \"AC was deeply vulnerable,\" Lambe explains. \"If we hadn't got him out on bail, he would have had to spend three months there. In court, you could see he was depressed.\"</p> <p>Distraught at the effect even a short incarceration was having on her son after one week, AC's mother turned to Lambe, who, as well as running JfK, is an in-house barrister at the firm Lawrence and Co, and head of its youth team. \"The ironic thing [about the case] is that because he'd never been in trouble before, the youth offending team (YOT) couldn't provide a risk assessment for him, so were saying: 'We don't want to offer a bail package because we don't know his risk,'\" says Lambe.</p> <p>Lambe convinced the judge to place AC, while a risk assessment was done, under the supervision of his aunt and uncle in a different area to the one where the alleged attack took place. \"That's when JfK got involved,\" Lambe says. \"We got him a mentor. They met every week and did some constructive activities. The thing about AC was that after he came out [of the STC], he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder because of the whole experience.\"</p> <p>She says AC's case is important because not only was his obvious vulnerability ignored at every stage of the justice process, his treatment is symptomatic of a broader problem. \"The problematic thing is that youths are seen as out of control, and so we are incarcerating more than anywhere in western Europe. And we incarcerate younger.\"</p> <p>To make matters worse, Lambe suggests, not only are young people such as AC being unnecessarily introduced to the children's prison system and put at risk, but too often the triggers for their encounters with the law are avoidable, trivial and even absurd. \"AC tells a story,\" says Lambe. \"He says: 'When I was five years old I wanted to be a police officer, but when I was 12 and I got my head jumped on by a police officer in a puddle and told I was a jungle bug, I lost respect for the police.'\" Lambe adds: \"The system tells them that they don't belong. And they end up in the criminal justice system, where no one understands them.\"</p> <p>Then there are the really \"bizarre\" and frustrating cases. \"Take looked-after children,\" Lambe says. \"There are boroughs trying to apply for asbos against children when they are supposed to be the [substitute] parent. It's shocking. I had a kid in court for criminal damage to a chair in a children's home.\"</p> <p><strong>Ongoing support</strong></p> <p>While JfK was set up to fill a gap in legal provision for young people, Lambe says that she and Stephenson recognised that those children most likely to end up in the system also needed \"much more\" than a legal representation. By offering ongoing support such as mentoring, and by being \"very much community-based\" with an \"open door\" policy, Lambe believes JfK is in a position to make a real difference, even if to only a small number of children. They have about 40 clients at any one time.</p> <p>The formality of the youth justice system and its emphasis on enforcement is off-putting for many youngsters, she says. \"Kids often see it as an extension of the police. YOTs are always perceived as part of the punishment. We are lucky. JfK [isn't seen as] part of an enforcement regime.\"</p> <p>Lambe grew up in Ascot, Berkshire, and went on to study philosophy and religion at Edinburgh University before taking her Bar exams and joining the legal profession. She says she \"had no idea what I was on course for\" when she started her career, and that it never occurred to her that she would become known for doing poorly-paid legal advocacy for disadvantaged kids. Nevertheless, she won a Woman of the Year award in 2007, and in 2006 was named on Management Today magazine's \"35 Women under 35\" list of high-flying young women in business.</p> <p>\"I kind of fell into it by doing death penalty work,\" Lambe explains. For three years, she worked alongside Clive Stafford Smith, the British-born lawyer famous for his defence of prisoners on death row in the US. It was, she says, \"the most amazing journey, although at the time it was the most depressing thing that ever happened to me\". Lambe worked on and won a number of cases involving innocent children who were sentenced to death in the southern state of Louisiana. \"I was working in the most racist parish in Louisiana, where the district attorneys wore a tie with a hangman's noose on it while they are sentencing people to death.\"</p> <p>It was tough work, but Lambe credits Stafford Smith with inspiring her to persevere, and for providing \"a fantastically supportive environment\" in which to take on such difficult work. She recalls visiting one of her young clients, who was \"caged for the rest of his life\", and him telling her despairingly: \"I should have got shot in the street like a dog.\"</p> <p>The scale of youth incarceration in Louisiana had an intense impact on Lambe. \"Angola prison just incarcerates young black men until they die,\" she says of the notorious jail in which some of her defendants were locked up. \"I thought: 'What a waste. There has to be more that can be done. These aren't bad kids. There's a reason why they got into these situations.'\"</p> <p>She resists over-analysing what motivates her, but says the enduring injustice faced by children from poorer backgrounds in Britain - if not quite the same as those in Louisiana - is the driving force.</p> <p>Of all the injustices Lambe has encountered, the one that resonates is the inappropriate use of physical restraint on young people when they are incarcerated. The deaths of Adam Rickwood and Gareth Myatt in 2004, after being restrained in STCs, put its use in the spotlight.</p> <p>Last year's move by the government to extend the circumstances in which restraint could be used to maintain \"good order and discipline\" was widely criticised. Its subsequent overturning by the court of appeal in July this year in a ruling that declared the new rules unlawful was \"really important\", says Lambe, whose client AC's case was the one brought to the court to challenge the government's actions. \"The government passed a statutory instrument without consultation,\" Lambe says. \"To me, it's a total anathema. If you start using physical discipline on people, then they will respond in the same way. These are already the most vulnerable children [as a result of] being in an STC.\"</p> <p><strong>Detrimental impact</strong></p> <p>The victory was an important one for young people's rights, Lambe says, but she is anxious to point out that multiple hurdles to getting justice remain. As \"profit-making businesses\", she says STCs are \"fundamentally wrong\" and can't be expected to deliver the best services. Cuts in legal aid are having a detrimental impact on representation, too. \"We are now no longer paid for the time it takes us to travel to visit our clients,\" she says. \"These kids are being penalised.\"</p> <p>Lambe is frustrated by a system she believes is repeatedly criminalising young people, and by what she says is a cultural climate in which the media and politicians stoke up fear of children. Yet she still believes that things could change for the better, if there was \"a recognition that bad behaviour doesn't make a bad person\". She warns: \"All of this criminalising a generation is going to come back in the government's face.\"</p> <p>As for JfK, there are no plans to expand it. \"It is necessarily community-based, and we have to fight so hard for every bit of funding,\" Lambe says. But she would love to see the model adopted elsewhere. \"What I most want is for the kids we work with, the ones who slip through the net, to get the same resources as other children in our society. A lot of the kids we work with are real fighters to have even survived.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.justforkidslaw.org\">justforkidslaw.org</a></p>",
  "<p>At just before 7.30 in Beijing last night Shelly Woods, a wheelchair racer from Blackpool, turned into the home straight of the Bird's Nest Stadium with a landmark achievement ahead. When she crossed the line in second place in the 1500m final, her success brought Britain its 100th medal of these Paralympic Games.</p> <p>Less than a mile away at the athletes' village her silver was marked on the chart outside Britain's headquarters. \"We might all be staying together but we don't see everyone,\" said the cyclist Darren Kenny. \"When you arrive back in the village after your event you would look at the board and see how many medals we had won that day - and it was so motivating.\"</p> <p>It is 24 years since the Paralympics first took place in conjunction with the Olympics and began to gain the type of recognition that has taken it to a new level in Beijing. And from a record number of competitors - about 4,200 from 144 nations - Britain has once more produced a spectacular performance. The team ended the penultimate day with 102 medals, second in the table to China, and 42 were gold - seven more than in Athens in 2004. No longer are the Paralympics a sideshow and the British team have achieved more than double the number of medals that the Olympic team won last month.</p> <p>It is likely to mean even more National Lottery funding between now and London 2012, particularly as they have easily passed the target of 95 set by UK Sport, the distributor of such funds. But it is not just about the money. Phil Lane, officiating at his second summer Paralympics as Britain's chef de mission, said: \"We have put an awful lot of preparation into it over the four years. Paralympic sports, unlike Olympic sports, do not always have the benefit of cohesive programmes within the governing bodies. We work closely with the national governing bodies to deliver a performance environment over the four years rather than right at the very end. It is consistency that has grown across the years.\"</p> <p>The 38-year-old Kenny represents how serious the Paralympics have become and why Britain is able to maintain this magnificent level as more athletes take part. Suffering from cerebral palsy, Kenny, from Dorset, has been full-time for six years. Qualified in the financial services, he is now one of 241 British Paralympians who are funded and he leaves Beijing with four golds and a silver from the track and the road. \"At this level you have to be full-time to compete with the rest of the world,\" he said. \"The standards go up quickly. Just look at the number of records broken on the track.\" </p> <p>Since Athens, UK Sport has almost doubled its investment in Paralympic sports to just over \u00a329.5m. Swimming received the most with \u00a36.9m, and the reward was 41 medals. Britain's cyclists, who have had funding of \u00a31.7m, won 20 medals including 17 golds, following on from the success of the Olympic team, who left Beijing with eight golds among their 14. </p> <p>They are all part of the same squad. As Chris Furber, Britain's Paralympic cycling coach, said before the Games: \"The Paralympic cyclists share the same track time, expertise and equipment and enjoy working alongside their Olympic colleagues. However, we are not just copying the Olympic team, and the Paralympic squad are leading the way. For example, UK Sport have assisted with technology and we now have the best tandem bikes in the world.\" </p> <p>The success of the Olympic team played a part - Britain celebrated its greatest Games for a century - but it was not a major factor in the Paralympians' glory. Kenny said: \"It has been four years of hard work and four years out of our lives. But [after the Olympics] you come here with that feel-good factor.\" </p> <p>As at the closing ceremony for the Olympics, the red London bus will roll into the Bird's Nest tonight as part of the handover celebrations and the task now is to ensure the momentum grows and future Paralympians emerge. \"That still remains one of our big challenges,\" said Lane. \"There is no doubt there has been a number of new faces who have moved into the sport. We have quite a lot of new faces in the team this time, but it is still an area that we have to work on very hard for 2012.\"</p> <h2>Golden days</h2> <p><strong>Paralympics medals table</strong></p> <p><strong> G S B Total</strong></p> <p><strong>China</strong> 87 68 52 207<br><strong> Great Britain 42 29 31 102</strong><br><strong>United States</strong> 36 34 28 98<br><strong>Ukraine</strong> 24 18 31 73<br><strong>Australia</strong> 22 29 27 78<br><strong>South Africa</strong> 21 3 5 29<br><strong>Canada</strong> 19 10 21 50<br><strong>Russia</strong> 18 23 21 62<br><strong>Spain</strong> 15 21 22 58</p> <p><strong>Final Olympics medals table</strong></p> <p><strong>China</strong> 51 21 28 100<br><strong>USA</strong> 36 38 36 110<br><strong>Russia</strong> 23 21 28 72<br><strong> Great Britain 19 13 15 47</strong><br><strong>Germany</strong> 16 10 15 41<br><strong>Australia</strong> 14 15 17 46<br><strong>South Korea</strong> 13 10 8 31<br><strong>Japan</strong> 9 6 10 25<br><strong>Italy</strong> 8 10 10 28</p>",

They say that in a trial run involving 10,000 people in five West Country constituencies two months ago, about half of the people telephoned took part in some, if not all, of the call.</p> <p>Lord Rennard, the Lib Dems' chief executive, who is the brains behind the scheme, said the calls would be a two-way communication between the party and voters.</p> <p>\"If you ring people up and tell them how they must vote that produces a negative response. But people warmed to our pilot in which we consulted people rather than telling them what they must think.</p> <p>\"Of course people have the option very quickly of putting the phone down. But a substantial number of people are willing to give you their views.\"</p> <p>The calls will be made tonight after Clegg mounts a strong attack on Labour and the Tories. In his conference speech he will say: \"Politics has changed for ever. Labour is finished. It's over. Remember 1997. Things can only get better? We were told our country would be a success - and no one would be left behind. It didn't happen. New Labour has failed.\"</p> <p>Clegg will also turn his fire on the Tories. He will say: \"There is a new New Labour on the block. Blue Labour: the Conservative party. Let our country not be fooled again. They are a say everything, do nothing party.\"</p> <p>Lib Dem strategists believe this week's conference will mark a turning point for the party in attacking Labour and the Tories. They believe Clegg's success in facing down a leftwing backbench rebellion on Monday to pave the way for a pledge to cut \u00a320bn in government spending will widen the Lib Dems' attack on both parties.</p> <p>Clegg hopes to appeal to Tory voters by using up to \u00a34bn of the \u00a320bn to finance further tax cuts, possibly extending a pledge to cut 4p off the basic rate of income tax to 6p.</p> <p>The Lib Dems will use this to try to outflank the Tories by portraying themselves as Britain's biggest tax cutting party.</p> <p>But Clegg will have Labour voters in the north in mind in saying that tax cuts would be aimed at lower and middle income earners.</p> <p>Tax increases, by taxing capital at the same rate as income, will also affect the wealthy.</p> <p>Up to \u00a316bn of the \u00a320bn spending cuts will be used to fund Lib Dem spending plans aimed at the less well-off.</p> <p>One idea is the \"pupil premium\", which is designed to increase spending on children from disadvantaged backgrounds.</p> <p>Clegg will say: \"My aim is to cut taxes so that nine out of 10 British taxpayers are better off.</p> <p>\"I want this to be the most progressive, most redistributive tax plan ever put forward by a British political party.\"</p> <p>Chris Huhne, the Lib Dems' home affairs spokesman, who was narrowly defeated by Clegg in last year's leadership contest, yesterday gave a taste of the battle when he devoted a third of his conference speech to attacking the Conservatives.</p> <p>Huhne received a standing ovation from delegates after he said: \"We are now told that David Cameron and George Osborne were idealistic young people who cared about fairness. Perhaps they agonised over their options as they adjusted their fancy tailcoats - mirror, mirror on the wall, which party is the fairest of them all?</p> <p>\"Fairness will be a Tory value when hell freezes over, Notting Hill becomes a workers' republic, and the Bullingdon club affiliates to the Socialist International.\"</p> <h2>Today</h2> <p><strong>9am</strong> Emergency debate on collapse of world trade negotiations</p> <p><strong>9.30am</strong> Debate on mental health provision</p> <p><strong>11.20am</strong> Debate on collection of personal data</p> <p><strong>11.50am</strong> Speech by Nick Clegg</p>",
  "<p>Half of all social housing tenants are out of work across the UK, and helping them find a way into training and employment is one of the biggest challenges facing the housing sector.</p> <p>At the Notting Hill Housing Trust in London, for example, just over 50% of its 60,000 tenants are on full-time benefits. \"It's an enormous mountain to climb,\" admits Vincent Thomas, assistant director of customer services. \"We are constantly trying to find ways of helping our tenants see social housing as a temporary stage in their lives, and often the biggest barrier is cultivating the kind of environment where this kind of confidence can be built.\" </p> <p>The trust is trying to develop a different way of helping tenants into work with Moving Forward, a new support scheme being piloted at Kerrington Court; a development of 24 one- and two-bedroom flats in Shepherds Bush, west London.</p> <p>The scheme, joint-funded by the Department of Communities and Local Government and the Department for Work and Pensions, was set up after the release of government statistics which revealed that more than half of working-age social tenants are out of employment, compared to 34% in 1981. Younger tenants are of particular concern. Currently 80% of new social housing tenants, between the ages of 16 and 24, are not in employment. </p> <p>Earlier this year, housing minister Caroline Flint suggested that job hunting could, and should be, a condition of tenancies. The issue will be debated at this week's National Housing Federation's conference after the federation warned that a \"work or lose your home\" approach would be unfair and unenforceable.</p> <p>Moving Forward is a step away from the usual policy of simply allocating properties to tenants. Instead, residents apply for accommodation and are then selected by interview. The trust advertised 24 flats at Kerrington Court last year, at rents of about \u00a380 a week on rolling, assured short-hold tenancies, with the proviso that tenants should be ambitious home owners and committed to getting back into work and training.</p> <p>The Notting Hill trust received more than 700 applications, of which 150 were short-listed. Prospective tenants were asked to make contact with the trust's employment initiatives team to arrange an interview to discuss their situation. The 70 who responded were given one-to-one coaching and advice about getting into work. As a result, 50% of Kerrington Court's first tenants were already working by the time they moved in, mostly in construction; a significant improvement from the trust's average of 30% employment in its other London properties. </p> <p>\"We wanted to start from a position of strength, so that residents moving into Kerrington Court were already pro-actively engaged with the scheme and to try and create an atmosphere of positive change,\" Thomas says. </p> <p>He points to a 2006 Mori poll commissioned by the trust, which revealed that 63% of residents wanted to be home owners. \"Kerrington Court is our attempt to create a community full of positive role-models, based on mutual support and where everybody is clear about their aspiration to get back into training and employment.\"</p> <p>Residents are asked to sign contracts to enter training and employment and agree \"action plans\", which set out a series of personal goals. These can include long-term objectives such as getting back into training or finding a part-time job. The trust provides tenants, their partners and families with personalised one-to-one career coaching and support such as help producing CVs and job searching as well as advice about child care and finances. </p> <p>Thomas believes Moving Forward will help evolve the trust's existing worklessness programmes, such as its construction training initiative, which runs in partnership with building companies. Because the programme adopts parts of the trust's existing employment, training and childcare programmes, it is relatively inexpensive. The main cost has been the \u00a31,700 spent on training five neighbourhood officers in motivational coaching and interviewing.</p> <p>So what happens if tenants \"break\" their contract or fail to get back into employment or training? \"In no way are we saying that tenants are obliged to find work, and getting into employment is absolutely not a condition of tenancy - if a tenant decides they don't want a Moving Forward approach, they can get regular social housing,\" says Thomas. </p> <p><strong>Evaluating success</strong></p> <p>Moving Forward has only been operating since April, but the trust and the government are keen to evaluate its success. The government hopes the scheme could be a model for other communities and is part-funding an \u00a380,000 independent evaluation by Mori later this year. </p> <p>The trust's ethos is shared by the Leeds-based housing organisation, Places for People, which has helped more than 200 tenants set up businesses, such as painting and decorating services, through its Enterprising Communities initiative.</p> <p>The Accent Group, which runs 19,500 properties across the north of England and the Midlands, is also expanding its mentoring scheme; helping to build tenants' skills and confidence before they re-enter the workplace. Mentors - some of which are recruited from the community, some ex-tenants - meet with tenants to discuss any problems with finding work, work experience or trainee placements. </p> <p>\"We've found regular mentoring really effective because it's more about giving people continual support. And for tenants looking to come out of unemployment, being able to build a supportive relationship with someone who understands what they are trying to achieve is amazingly productive in building confidence levels,\" says chief executive Martin Kelly.</p> <p>Accent also runs vocational schemes including Youthbuild, a \u00a3500,000-a-year scheme where young tenants can train with the building firms working on construction and maintenance of Accent's properties. Another strand of Youthbuild, works to help young people find work in the financial and banking sectors. In the past year, 1,000 trainees have gone through Youthbuild, with 83% achieving qualifications or employment. \"Housing associations can act as pathways back into employment, but the focus has to be on the individual,\" says Kelly. \"The majority of our tenants don't want to be workless, it's just a case of helping them build their own road back into employment.\"</p> <p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p> <p>Notting Hill Housing Trust: <a href=\"http://www.nottinghillhousing.org.uk\">nottinghillhousing.org.uk</a></p> <p>Places for People: <a href=\"http://www.placesforpeople.co.uk\">placesforpeople.co.uk</a></p> <p>Accent Group: <a href=\"http://www.accentgroup.org\">accentgroup.org</a></p> <h2>How does it work?</h2> <p><strong>Ivy Nwafo, 26, shares a one-bedroom flat with her partner at Notting Hill Housing Trust's Kerrington Court</strong></p> <p>It's been tough being out of work for so long because after a while you think there must be something really wrong with you. Before I moved here I felt like it wasn't worth getting out of bed in the morning. If we weren't on Moving Forward or in Kerrington Court I don't think we would have the motivation to get back into work at all. </p> <p>But things have already changed since we moved here in April. After we settled in and agreed our action plans, an adviser came to visit us and talk through our work options and see if they could help out with things like putting a CV together. </p> <p>I want to get into TV work and so we've been looking into vocational training schemes or taking a junior position like a runner for a production company. I have been getting more interviews and am feeling a lot more confident than I've felt in years.</p> <p>The other thing is that whenever I've thought about starting work or training, I start worrying about how we'd pay the bills, so the help we've been given through Moving Forward in sorting out our financial planning and budgeting has been really useful. My partner is now a lot more confident that he'll be able to get back into the workplace. </p> <p>I've done employment schemes at housing associations before, but the thing that's different about living here is that we've all come in here wanting to do something better with our lives, so everyone is committed. It's definitely given me an idea of how I could get into the media industry. I aim to be in work in the next few months and to start saving for our own place as soon as possible.</p>",
  "<p>A fatal combination of loyalty and fear is besetting the Labour party. </p> <p>There is no real faith that a change of face at the helm will really help. Only a genuine relaunch, complete with non-gimmicky policies that reflect what people are really experiencing, can raise the sinking ship. </p> <p>And, on that measure, there is no obvious replacement candidate. (Or have Alan Johnson, Alan Milburn and Stephen Byers been quiet over the summer because they've been doing some serious policy work?) </p> <p>As the implications of the global situation become clearer, the need for a strong, steady hand to guide the country becomes urgent.

  "<p>These are quiet, gentle days in the maelstrom. While many local places are still recovering from flash floods and the news from around the world is full of hurricanes, typhoons, landslides and earthquakes, the soft light of autumn here falls on ripening fruits and turning leaves. Taking advantage of the English Heritage open day, we go in search of some English heritage - a strange and often brutal history concealed in the stones of great buildings. Here at Wenlock priory, visitors hold devices which look like mobile phones to their ears and listen to the guided tour of the ruins. This is the ubiquitous and global 21st-century pose: ear clamped to a disembodied voice, slightly bowed, detached. </p> <p>The priory's story is a good one, but I wonder what people see of the place itself. Do they see the stonecrops and mosses on the masonry? Do the white splat marks on stones which look like guano reveal themselves to be lichens as white as the limewash which once covered the walls? Are they intrigued by maidenhair and wall rue spleenwort ferns and the variation in frond shapes? Do they hear the rooks and jackdaws calling from high walls? There is another kind of heritage here, one which exists in parallel with the stories of people and although influenced by us is indifferent to us. In the cracks and shadows are things which have persisted through time as if it meant nothing. Very few features of the priory reflect a world which predates it, but one, my favourite stone, does. A lintel in the chapter house bears a strange carving of wolf-headed fish and what may be a cat-faced figure with a fierce expression. This seems to me to be a story speaking to us from a more distant age. It could well conceal something dark and brutal, but there's a real excitement to it and a defiance of all we have come to know as heritage.</p>",

Members of the Jason Group - an independent US defence advisory body (and therefore, one assumes, a collection of really quite clever people) - were deployed to tell us that enriched uranium is uranium that has had its useful lighter atoms separated from its not-so-useful heavier atoms in a centrifuge. You expected a harassed teacher to pop up at the end and tell them to label their work clearly before going home.</p> <p>The co-discoverer of the double-helix structure of DNA, Dr James D Watson, got four seconds to express a vague hope that the knowledge of genetic immutables yielded by the Human Genome Project would make us more compassionate and not unleash a new eugenics movement. Theoretical physics professor Michio Kaku from City University of New York was allowed to do little more than describe oil and coal as \"concentrated sunlight\", which led - a hop, skip and several jumps over giant gaps later - to the narrator delivering a somewhat anti-climactic warning that the new president will face applications for 30 new nuclear reactors when he takes office.</p> <p>It was a hotchpotch of fascinating ideas and dilemmas hinted at, vaguely glimpsed and then lost to the ether - a shoddy, maddening affair best symbolised by the fact that they didn't bother to find a narrator who could pronounce the word \"nuclear\" properly.</p> <p>And talking of shoddy and maddening, welcome to Channel 4's <strong>The Sex Education Show</strong>. This purports to be a groundbreaking attempt \"to get the nation talking about sex\". I had thought this was a nut that had been largely cracked, but apparently not. For the good of our psychosexual health, therefore, presenter Anna Richardson undergoes a vaginal exam on camera, watches half a team of footballers have their penises swabbed (one bloke thinks this is done with a wire brush: you only hope that his genitalia are found to be sufficiently gummed up as to make breeding a mere hypothesis), learns burlesque dancing, and shows pictures to teenagers of diseased nether regions to ruin theirs. </p> <p>Richardson also presides over the mandatory studio chat between members of the public, every one clearly the winner of a regional heat to find the country's most overconfident moron. Here we gain the invaluable knowledge that the majority of teenagers have looked at porn, having an STD still carries a social stigma and if, like, a girl sleeps with loads of boys she's, like, a slag, whereas if a boy sleeps around he's, like, really respected, yeah. </p> <p>There is one enduring form of entertainment that arises from such programmes, and that is watching presenter and audience struggle to remain entirely non-judgmental in the face of increasing provocation. At the end of a segment about teenagers who use networking websites to arrange sex parties in their parents' back gardens, Anna bravely turns to her raked rows of fellow imbeciles and professes herself slightly shocked. The audience sees its chance. No, no, it says, shaking its collective head. Are we shocked that teenagers are posing like porn stars on Facebook, organising orgies and furiously pumping chlamydia into one another all the live long day? Not us! One person eventually criticised the parents shown in the segment for letting their pubescent Caligulas use their hot tub, and a gentle hiss of relief escaped from the audience like air from an overpressurised tyre, as they found an outlet for their pent-up disgust. </p> <p>Next week Tana \"Wife of Gordon\" Ramsay discusses childbirth, Anna researches whether aphrodisiac foods really work, and all in all, tertiary syphilis comes to look like a welcome relief.

  "<p>The banking group HBOS endured another torrid day on the stock market yesterday, losing 40% of its market value by mid-afternoon and facing fresh questions about its ability to keep funding its operations in paralysed financial markets.</p> <p>Despite repeated assurances from the country's biggest mortgage lender that it was robust enough to withstand the turmoil, investors remained concerned about its business model. HBOS shares lost 17% of their value on Monday after the collapse of Lehman Brothers.</p> <p>The extraordinary fall in HBOS's share price forced it to issue a statement saying it had a \"strong capital base\" which helped stem some of the slide. But the shares still ended 22% lower at 182p after the rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's (S&amp;P) downgraded a crucial rating to A+ from AA- .</p> <p>The impact on HBOS - which, with 2 million shareholders, has more investors than any other company - caused Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, to call on the Financial Services Authority (FSA) to intervene to stop \"short selling\" of bank shares by hedge funds. \"Speculation is a normal part of trading in shares,\" he said. \"But on this occasion the hedge funds are betting against the taxpayer, since they know that if a leading British bank were to collapse, the government would have no alternative but to intervene\".</p> <p>The FSA, while declining to comment on HBOS specifically, said it was \"closely monitoring the markets especially during such market volatility\". S&amp;P said it was downgrading HBOS because it believed the bank was \"less well positioned to manage the deteriorating operating environment\" than its peers, citing its exposure to the mortgage market, which accounts for more than half of its total loans.</p> <p>At the heart of the concerns among investors is HBOS's reliance on the money markets to raise funds to finance its business which, as well as lending money for homes, is a lender to big businesses and private equity deals.</p> <p>The bank said it has a large pool of deposits - \u00a3280bn - from savers and holds one in every five pounds saved in Britain to make it the UK's biggest deposit-taker. Most of its funding - 52% - comes from these deposits.</p> <p>Lloyds TSB, which has a higher AA- rating and, at one point yesterday, was the biggest riser in the FTSE 100, achieves 61% of its funding from its deposits.</p> <p>Analysts at Exane BNP Paribas said HBOS was more reliant on wholesale funding than its peers but it was not alone in requiring such wholesale funding. \"We believe that the market has assigned an unduly pessimistic assessment of HBOS's funding position and therefore, as the position is clarified ... the HBOS share price should recover,\" said James Eden, banks analyst at Exane BNP Paribas.</p> <p>But in addition to funding issues and its exposure to the mortgage market, there are questions about HBOS's strategy towards corporate customers, a business it has expanded rapidly since the merger between Halifax and Bank of Scotland created the bank seven years ago.</p> <p>That deal allowed the vast deposits accumulated by Halifax to help fuel Bank of Scotland's corporate banking operations.</p> <p>It also united a vast number of brands including fund manager Insight Investment and the insurance group Clerical Medical. The bank also has operations in Ireland and Australia where it owns Bank West. </p> <p>As a result of its conversion from a building society, HBOS has more private shareholders - more than 2 million - than any other stock market listed company.</p>",
  "<p>Ordinary traders were once again talking of meltdown, as yesterday brought a fresh slide in London shares and fears of a crisis at the mortgage lending giant HBOS. But the more thoughtful among them were talking instead about a Minsky moment. The economist Hyman Minsky said instability was not an aberration in finance, but its core. Finance is the bloodstream of the economy, and any poison entering it soon pollutes the whole system. These twin features - unusual volatility and high contagion - mean banks need superintending more closely than widget manufacturers.</p> <p>Even after all the concerted intervention yesterday of central banks across the globe to steady nerves in financial markets and pump money into the system, the greatest single danger remains that the authorities will be too passive. Indeed the US central bank disappointed investors and financiers last night by holding its key interest at 2%. Amid all this, the government risks being a bystander. The Scotland Office minister David Cairns stepped forward as the latest Labour rebel yesterday; more serious, perhaps, is the Bank of England's semi-detached attitude. In a public letter yesterday, its governor, Mervyn King, had to explain why inflation had risen to 4.7% in August. Amid four pages surveying commodity prices and the theoretical danger of embedding inflationary expectations, there was a one-line reference to the current mayhem on the global money markets. That was enough to stoke expectations of a modest rate cut before too long, but hardly suggests the Bank is seized by the need to avoid a wholesale slump. Since the market turmoil began last summer, the Federal Reserve has cut rates dramatically, which has suited Wall Street well; but when it comes to wider action the US authorities still give the impression of wanting to tread carefully back towards business as usual.</p> <p>But business as usual is, of course, what got us into this mess in the first place. If financiers are to enjoy bail-outs then they must also mend their ways. The current order was defined by the banker-knows-best ideology. For the last two decades this approach suited not just the money men themselves but also politicians chasing quick growth - and for that matter individuals wanting cheap loans. Assets were repackaged into new-fangled shapes, and spun candyfloss style into a great cone of debt. The realisation that this was largely whipped out of thin air is what is now causing the chaos. Watching trading-floor panic and flashing red screens, the public looks on with anxious bafflement - hoping that someone will do something soon to get things under control. If confidence is not somehow restored, the reign of pessimism could prove absolute. As households cut spending, it would not just be the City but the whole economy that would be dragged into the mire. Speaking after an earlier financial crisis had been allowed to play out in this way, Franklin Roosevelt explained to the American people that the only thing to fear was fear itself. He started to lift spirits when he promised \"action and action now\".</p> <p>The restoration of the kind of safeguards installed at that time is one important step. A US firewall between retail and investment banks, for instance, was installed in the 1930s but demolished in recent years. As investment banks crumble, it is plain that the system needs such protection again. There is also need for a total overhaul of the way financial products are governed. Purveyors of the complex bets known as credit derivatives can do what they like until regulators ask them to stop. It is time to shift to a precautionary principle so that new financial products are licensed only when they have been shown to be safe. Drugs have long been subject to licensing, and so too should derivatives. Of course this will constrain financial creativity. But events are fast showing that creating a global market in debt also has vicious side-effects.</p>",
  "<p>While Marks &amp; Spencer and Next are struggling to pull in cash-strapped fashion shoppers, Debenhams has reported encouraging trading figures and said it is on track to hit City profit targets.</p> <p>In an end-of-year trading update, the 139-strong department store chain said it was winning sales from its bigger high-street rivals. Like-for-like sales in the year to the end of August were down 0.9% - which analysts said implied only a 2% dip in the past two months - a far better performance than that of Next.</p> <p>Rob Templeman, chief executive, said August was better than July but predicted tough trading conditions would last another year and said the banking crisis would be a new blow to fragile consumer confidence. \"When you look at what's happened in just the last few days, all of that doesn't help,\" he said.</p> <p>Gross margins were flat on the year and the retailer said it had cleared out last year's stock, \"enabling us to enter the new financial year with a very clean stock position\". The chain has improved its fashion credentials in recent months and has streamlined its ranges.</p> <p>The City is expecting profit of about \u00a3110m, down from \u00a3131m a year ago, when the store chain announces its annual results next month. Templeman said the net debt position would also be in line with forecasts, at about \u00a31bn. The shares - which rejoined the stock market at 195p in 2006 after two years in private equity hands - gained 3.25p to 46p in midday trading before closing down 0.75p at 42p.</p> <p>Freddie George, of Seymour Pierce, urged investors to sell the shares and set a target of 35p. \"We are concerned that in a more difficult trading environment in 2008-09, the company will come close to breaching its [banking] covenants.\"</p> <p>However, Templeman insisted there was little risk of any breach: \"Debenhams is a highly cash generative business ... The one thing that Debenhams has always done is surprise people on the positive side about its debt position.\" </p> <p>Philip Dorgan, of Panmure Gordon, rates the stock a hold, while Matthew McEachran at Kaupthing rates it a buy.</p>",
  "<p>Berkeley Group said yesterday its house sales were running at half their historic average but it was still in financial good health and well placed to snap up land being disposed of by rivals.</p> <p>A trading statement covering the four months to the end of August said there was no lift in the \"particularly challenging\" business environment, but the housebuilder boasted that a flexible operating model meant it could match supply to demand and maximise returns in all market conditions.</p> <p>\"Since the beginning of its financial year, Berkeley has experienced sales levels approximately 50% below the historic average. This is a level that, with the benefit of the strong opening forward sales position, will enable the group to meet its strategic objectives,\" it said.</p> <p>Cash generation was ahead of plan with the company increasing its net cash position to \u00a371m against net debt of \u00a34.5m at the start of the year. This strength would enable it to \"take advantage of the numerous land opportunities that are coming to the market\".</p> <p>Its shares dipped 2% to 839p amid turbulence in financial markets after the filing for bankruptcy protection by investment bank Lehman Brothers, though Berkeley said it expected to maintain its operating margins and was in line to meet profit expectations at the half and full year.</p> <p>The company added that it had started the financial year in a strong position, with forward sales of \u00a31.2bn and gearing of less than 1%. </p> <p>It has benefited from focusing on redevelopment work in the south-east of England and its share price has performed much better than those of rivals such as Persimmon and Taylor Woodrow, whose stockmarket values have plunged by 65% and about 80% respectively over the past year.</p> <p>Berkeley has also seen its cash position improved by an agreement with shareholders to defer dividend payments for three years in return for a \u00a312-a-share payout over seven years. Of that, \u00a39 has been paid but the remaining tranche will not be settled until the start of 2014, rather than by January 2011.</p> <p>Analysts at Landsbanki said they were impressed by the forward sales figure but warned that, in a mood of financial uncertainty for buyers, no final deals could be guaranteed. Berkeley said it welcomed government initiatives to help first-time buyers - including temporarily raising the level at which stamp duty becomes payable from \u00a3125,000 to \u00a3175,000 - but cautioned that the market was dependent on liquidity coming back to mortgage lending and on a return of the feelgood factor which was linked to the wider economy \"and, in particular, job security\".</p> <p>The average price of homes fell 13% year on year in August, according to Halifax, Britain's largest mortgage lender, and estate agents have, over the past three months, sold only one house a week.</p>",
  "<p>British Airways boss Willie Walsh last night brushed aside recent oil price falls, insisting the crisis facing the airline industry would be \"deep and protracted\".</p> <p>Speaking to a business audience at the London Chamber of Commerce, Walsh said: \"Despite a recent and perhaps temporary fall, oil prices stand at extremely high levels and look likely to stay there.\"</p> <p>BA has made clear it expects its fuel bill for the current year to jump by \u00a31bn, a cost which could easily wipe out group profits. For the 12 months ending March 31, the airline reported a pre-tax profit of \u00a3883m when its average oil price was $70 a barrel.</p> <p>\"Our fuel bill now represents about 35% of our costs, compared with less than 10% at the start of this decade. Meanwhile, demand for travel has weakened because of the general economic downturn and a decline in consumer confidence,\" Walsh said. \"All in all, this is a devastating combination.\"</p> <p>He noted the recent collapse of Britain's third-largest tour operator, XL Leisure, pointing out it was just the latest in about 30 carriers to have failed this year. Others include Silverjet, Eos and Maxjet. </p> <p>Walsh warned: \"There will be more to come as we head toward the traditionally poorer returns of the winter travel season.\"</p> <p>Iata, the international airlines trade body, recently predicted losses for global aviation would reach \u00a33bn this year, and \u00a32.3bn next year.</p> <p>A recruitment freeze, a voluntary redundancy programme and a 3% reduction in scheduled flights for the winter season are among BA's measures to cope with the crisis. Walsh stressed the need to tackle the challenges at a strategic level. </p> <p>\"That is why we are pursuing merger talks with Iberia, and why we have applied, with Iberia, to establish a joint business agreement with American Airlines on flights across the Atlantic,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>When welfare rights adviser, Trish Martin, ran her first \"debt surgery\" at one of William Sutton's social housing estates in Plymouth, she wasn't sure anyone would turn up. After an hour and a half, the first tenant tentatively poked a head around the door. An hour later there were seven people waiting outside. By the end of the morning a small crowd had gathered. In the end she had to come back the next day to fit them all in.</p> <p>\"I got the impression that word swept around the estate that someone was here who wasn't a monster, who wasn't going to dob them in about their problems meeting rent or make any kind of judgement about their situation,\" she says. \"And once people realised that someone was there actually on the estate, actually giving out advice about money and welfare problems, they just kept coming.\" In line with the government's \u00a3120m Financial Inclusion Fund to ramp up the availability of free face-to-face money advice, William Sutton is just one of the increasing numbers of housing associations starting to recruit and train more specialist in-house staff to deliver financial inclusion programmes to their residents. The support is vital as tenants feel the effects of the credit crunch.</p> <p><strong>Welfare maximisation</strong></p> <p>Martin is now the association's welfare rights manager. She, and her team of four, travel to William Sutton homes across the north-east on a daily basis, giving advice to tenants having problems with their welfare benefits. Last year, Martin's team advised 954 William Sutton residents and she estimates that they collectively made an additional \u00a3894,000 for their tenants through welfare maximisation in 2007.</p> <p>Martin says that her team see first-hand the enormous difference that their work can make to some of William Sutton's 50,000 tenants, over half of whom are unemployed. </p> <p>\"When we're training our in-house staff to deliver welfare advice, we always ask them to think about how they would cope living on around \u00a360 a week,\" she says. \"Just last week one of our welfare officers saw that a man who was wrongly put on the lowest rate of disability living allowance got the \u00a317 extra a week he was entitled to and it transformed his life. It sounds like nothing to most people, but to this tenant it meant a huge difference in what he could afford and what he couldn't.\" </p> <p>Martin is now extending William Sutton's in-house welfare advice services to include basic debt services and financial management programmes. From next month, the housing association will also provide all tenants with a toolkit to enable them to budget more efficiently and maximise their income. </p> <p>\"We've already started training up staff to be aware of why people get into debt, how we can spot people having money problems, how to go through outreach when people start missing their rent arrears,\" she says. \"This is an area where I see us being able to really make an impact as the credit crunch begins to bite.\"</p> <p>To meet the growing demand for tenant debt and welfare advice services, the professional organisation the Chartered Institute of Housing (CIH) is launching the first ever training course for dedicated financial inclusion projects staff in housing associations. </p> <p>\"There is a huge unmet demand for training and support in this area,\" says Sharon Wheeler, CIH financial capability advisor. \"Many housing organisations are realising that the more they build the capability of their residents to manage their money, the more the residents themselves and the organisation will benefit.\"</p> <p><strong>Economic exclusion</strong></p> <p>CIH estimates that 70% of the three million people who don't have bank accounts are social housing tenants. And it is social housing tenants without the means to pay by direct debit or lacking the necessary information to ensure they are paying the best tariffs, who are likely to be hit by the fall out of a slowing global economy, such as rising fuel prices.</p> <p>\"Although around 90% of our debt and welfare advice continue to be outsourced to interdependent agencies, our internal capacity to deal with debt or benefits work will have to reflect the greater need that we're going to be seeing,\" says Jason Herbert, financial inclusion manager at Hyde Housing, a housing association managing 40,000 properties in London and the south-east. Hyde Housing is looking to recruit more staffed trained in debt and welfare advice. It currently works in partnership with local debt agencies to refer tenants and provide expertise. To avoid any potential clashes of interest over the issue of tenants seeking advice over rent arrears, any internal staff giving advice on debt or benefit work independently from other housing staff.</p> <p>\"Any in-house debt or welfare staff we are recruiting, go through an extensive training process,\" says Herbert. \"Aside from the obvious skills such as the relevant qualifications and a very good standard of financial literacy, in-house staff working on these very sensitive issues have to have exceptionally good people skills and be able to listen and gain the trust of people who won't always believe you're there to help them.\"</p> <p>Colin Trend, a project manager at independent debt advice agency Money Advice Plymouth, works with a number of housing associations delivering debt advice to tenants. He believes the need to catch people's financial problems as early as possible is growing increasingly urgent. It's an area where he believes associations can make a significant impact. </p> <p>\"One of the main problems independent debt advice agencies have is that often by the time people have made it to their door, it's too late,\" he says. \"While I think independent debt advice agencies will always have to tackle the more serious debt problems, dedicated housing association staff are going to prove vital in ensuring that we catch people's money problems when they first start, rather than the day before the bailiffs arrive. And they're going to become very welcome faces around social housing estates in the very difficult few years we have ahead of us.\"</p> <p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p> <p>William Sutton Homes: <a href=\"http://www.williamsutton.org.uk\">williamsutton.org.uk</a></p> <p>Hyde Housing Association: <a href=\"http://www.hyde-housing.co.uk\">hyde-housing.co.uk</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/sep/17/housing.communities10\">Career choice: Welfare debt officer</a></p>",
  "<h2>Trying times for deniers</h2> <p>Rightwing commentators and climate change deniers have gone wild at the trial verdict that cleared Greenpeace direct action protesters of committing a criminal offence. Top marks to Richard Littlejohn, in the Daily Mail, who hopelessly confuses climate change with the ozone layer in his rant, and compounds his ignorance by saying \"the ice caps are not melting\". </p> <p>But a gold star goes to Melanie Phillips, writing in her Spectator blog, who calls the Greenpeace action \"environmental terrorism\". Phillips knows enough climate science to state that James Hansen, director of the Nasa Goddard Institute for Space Studies and probably the world's foremost atmospheric scientist, is \"totally wrong\". Green protesters must also be reeling to hear, courtesy of Brendan O'Neill, a former Marxist now editing Spiked, that far from waging war against uncaring governments, they are now the \"militant wing of the elite\". More worrying is weatherman Anthony Watts, who is now leading a movement in the US to have Hansen fired from Nasa for \"siding with vandalism\" and \"violating the code of ethics\", and even \"misusing his position\" when he appeared as a Greenpeace defence witness. Watts is a meteorologist at KPAY-AM, which is affiliated with Fox News, the TV station that has led the US right's assault on global warming science. </p> <h2>Nuclear fallout</h2> <p>E.ON, the German energy company that owns Kingsnorth power station, was keeping its head down after the Greenpeace verdict, but it's leaked out that it is now planning to build a nuclear reactor on the banks of the river Severn at Oldbury, Gloucestershire. Nearby communities need not expect anything too soon. The company wants a European pressurised reactor, the kind now under construction at Olkiluoto, Finland, and Flamanville, northern France. Both projects are entangled in construction problems; foundations have been laid with the wrong mix of concrete, and welds have been wrongly applied. Olkiluoto is now two-and-a-half years behind schedule and \u00a31bn overspent. Flamanville is six months behind schedule.</p> <h2>Against the grain</h2> <p>Back in 1999, it emerged that Monsanto had to ban GM food in its canteen at its High Wycombe HQ, Buckinghamshire. Now Eco Soundings hears that Hugh Grant, the company's CEO, has turned to organic food. Here is an extract of Grant on American public radio two weeks ago.</p> <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Do you worry at all about the rise of organic foods and people being more interested in more natural produce and product? <strong>Grant:</strong> No, no, I don't. I think if you walk through any supermarket a portion of that shelf is going to be organic, and that's fine. And a big piece of that shelf is driven by quality and affordability. A lot of the organic material is still pretty expensive. <strong>Interviewer:</strong> Do you ever buy organic food yourself? <strong>Grant:</strong> Yeah, I do.</p> <h2>Forest of figures</h2> <p>Here's hedge fund veteran and former deputy chairman of the giant Man Group, Stanley Fink, doing the maths in front of Prince Charles, Sir David Attenborough and the City at the rainforest dinner last week: \"On European markets, the right to emit one tonne of CO2 trades today at about $30; it has been estimated that, by 2020, this price could rise to $80. Every hectare of rainforest stores a carbon equivalent to 500 tonnes of CO2. This means that each hectare of rainforest left alive is potentially a $15,000 asset - some 75 times more than its land value. Put simply, no crop can match the value per hectare of rainforest. With an estimated 610bn tonnes of CO2 sequestered by our tropical rainforests, a vast $18tn business opportunity is before us. Even paying a 2% yield on the carbon value of one hectare left alive would produce a higher return than converting it into ranch land.\" </p> <h2>Welsh rarity</h2> <p>There's a new TV ad for Welsh lamb, and it's set in driving rain in the Brecon Beacons.

London's FTSE 100 index closed at its lowest in three years amid forecasts that the credit crunch could see more than 100,000 jobs shed by the UK's financial sector over the next year.</p> <p>Government sources said they had learnt lessons from the collapse of Northern Rock a year ago, adding that they had thought about what they might do if a similar situation ever arose again.</p> <p>The authorities were, however, keen to play down any talk of a crisis, and Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England, dropped no hint that he supported an early cut in borrowing costs when he wrote to the chancellor, Alistair Darling, to explain the latest rise in the inflation rate to 4.7% - more than double the 2% target.</p> <p>With oil almost $60 a barrel down on its peak of $147 in August, King said he expected inflation to peak at around 5% but to remain above target well into next year.

However, the Dow Jones industrial average was later up more than 100 points.</p> <p>On Wall Street , AIG's share price fell 40% in after-hours trading. After a day of emergency talks, congressional leaders were briefed that the Federal Reserve had agreed in principle to lend $85bn to AIG in return for an 80% stake. The arrangement is highly contentious because it renders AIG's shares virtually worthless. The administration will also face tough questions about why it is willing to rescue AIG but allow Lehman to go bust.</p> <p>Earlier, the Fed said in a statement: \"Strains in financial markets have increased significantly and labour markets have weakened further.\" It added, however, that it was as concerned about inflation as it was about growth.</p> <p>Asian and European stockmarkets fell heavily after Monday's 500-point drop in the Dow Jones. Tokyo's Nikkei index was down 5%, while London's FTSE 100 slipped 178.6 points to a three-year low.</p> <p>Angel Gurria, secretary general of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, said the turmoil in the markets had put back recovery by a year. \"It has turned into a much bigger, more widespread and more threatening situation, \" Gurria told the Guardian.</p> <p>\"Recovery was going to be the end of 2008 but that has now gone. It will now be a year from now.\"</p>",
  "<p>Earlier this year, while writing a documentary on Kivalina, one of several Alaskan barrier-reef islands slipping into the sea, and among the world's worst ecological disasters, I stumbled on the state's 44-year-old governor Sarah Palin. Even then, as she posed in the snow-covered wilderness beside her seaplane and fresh animal kills, rumours swirled around her that she might be a vice-presidential contender. In an extraordinary twist of fate, this sharp-shooter and former small-town beauty queen, who until two years ago was mayor of her tiny hometown, Wasilla, Alaska, has become the American right's golden girl.</p> <p>Ever since the Palin family soap drama hit prime time, the mainstream media has focused on digging up the dirt, but there have been few mentions about her environmental history. Palin is governor of a state that has seen the most dramatic effects of a warming world, yet until last week she remained unconvinced that climate change is in any way man-made. \"The jury's still out on that one,\" she said, just days after the recent hurricanes and tropical storms were making their way across the Atlantic, offering a glimpse of the climate chaos that may be left for future generations.</p> <p>Palin, in a recent interview with Newsmax.com, accepted that warming would affect Alaska \"more than any other state, because of our location\". But she added: \"I'm not one though who would attribute it to being manmade.\" Such a position would put her to the right even of President Bush and some of the oil companies - and it is now scaring the international community. </p> <p>Last Friday, she finally conceded that the problem might be man-made. In an interview with ABC television, she said: \"I'm attributing some of man's activities to potentially causing some of the changes in the climate right now.\"</p> <p>Chris Mooney, author of The Republican War on Science, says: \"The irony of a climate change denier being based in Alaska is breathtaking. The state is warming faster than practically anywhere else, with winter temperatures up by 6F since 1950. Visitors to Alaska can see the evidence all around, from drunken forests of semi-fallen trees and sunken roads, all unseated by the melting of the permafrost, to unprecedented forest fires.\"</p> <p>For conservation and animal protection groups, Palin has long been considered an enemy. According to Greenpeace, \"Palin has the most anti-environment records of any governor in the US. She has supported oil drilling in some of the most ecologically sensitive areas in Alaska, even when it meant sacrificing polar bears and beluga whales.\"</p> <p>Only this month, Palin told the Republican party convention: \"We Americans need to produce more of our own oil and gas. And take it from a gal who knows the North Slope of Alaska, we've got lots of both.\"</p> <p>Brent Blackwelder, president of Friends of the Earth US, says: \"Sarah Palin's record is not extensive - just two years ago she was the mayor of a city of fewer than 10,000 people - but what it indicates is troubling. She has been a friend of Big Oil, opposing a windfall profits tax on the oil industry that could fund affordable clean energy for more Americans. Oh, and Palin's husband works for BP.\"</p> <p><strong>Literally drowning</strong></p> <p>Palin is, if nothing else, consistent. She tried to sue the US government to derail the listing of polar bears as a threatened species, fearing that it would get in the way of oil and gas development - this as the ice melts under their paws and they are literally drowning.</p> <p>She then wrote a piece for the New York Times, saying that these \"magnificent cuddly white bears are doing just fine and don't need our protection. If the ice melts, they'll adapt to living on land\". That is a contention most scientists found reckless, given that polar bears have shown little ability to feed on land.</p> <p>Palin also questioned the scientific consensus that global warming is melting the Arctic sea ice, but failed to mention oil drilling or the routine oil spills that, over the years, have destroyed the ecology of nearly 18,000 acres of wildlife and marine habitat.</p> <p>\"We need to drill, drill, drill,\" she told the Wall Street Journal recently, and she is in the forefront of moves to exploit the long-protected Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). \"If Alaskans can't do that on our own land, then the nation is going to be in a world of hurt, depending on dangerous foreign powers.\" She argues that \"ANWR is only the size of the Los Angeles airport, and drilling there isn't environmentally destructive\".</p> <p>In oil-rich Alaska, that goes down well. Many residents support drilling in the 7.7m-hectare refuge on the north coast, an area considered by conservationists as a treasured wild place. \"If you're not for opening ANWR, in the state of Alaska, you couldn't get elected dog-catcher,\" says former Alaska state representative Ray Metcalfe, a Republican-turned-Democrat who supports Barack Obama.</p> <p>Alaska is wildly beautiful and sparsely populated, with abundant natural resources that more recently have started to become scarce. In her two years as governor, Palin has got her own pleasure out of its wildlife. There are photos of her posing with the bloodied carcasses of moose, caribou, elk and grizzly bear.</p> <p>This summer, she reached new lows in the eyes of conservationists by approving the killing of black bear sows with cubs. The year before, she put a $150 bounty on wolf paws to entice hunters to kill more of these elusive wild dogs. She also spent $400,000 of public money to defeat an initiative that would have banned aerial hunting of wolves for sport.</p> <p>\"Palin is an environmental horror story,\" claims conservationist Dave Chandler. \"Alaska's out-of-control wolf slaughter is pretty brutal. When she approved the killing of all wolves in the Cold Bay area, state officials illegally killed 14 wolf pups - after killing their mothers - by dragging them out of their dens and shooting them.\"</p> <p>When environmentalists or concerned citizens from the other 48 states (where wolves are protected) dared to object to the idea of a hunting free-for-all, Palin protested that they didn't \"understand rural Alaska\". </p> <p>The state that Palin governs consists of 660,000 people, with a minority that loves the wilderness and is animals, and a majority - mostly Republican - that appears to want to squeeze all the cash it can get out of the state before the oil dries up, the fish die and the wildlife disappears.</p> <p>Alaskans, who annually receive oil-royalty dividends - $1,654 each last year - think of themselves as fiercely independent, but in fact are completely dependent on oil. As in many resource-rich economies, this has tended to encouraged corruption and bad governance, and a culture of impunity among lawmakers. After a four-year FBI investigation, several Alaskan businessmen and politicians - including the state's US senator, Ted Stevens - have been convicted of making and taking bribes to keep a tax on oil profits at an artificially low 20%. Palin herself is facing one abuse-of-power investigation for allegedly using her position to settle family scores by exacting retribution against her former brother-in-law, a state trooper, and firing officials who would not toe the line.</p> <p><strong>Selling out</strong></p> <p>Palin claims to be embarrassed by Alaska's national reputation as a corrupt backwater. Yet critics say she is in the pocket of Big Oil and is maintaining the state's tradition of selling out its natural resources. She swept into the governor's office as a self-styled renegade, promising to shake up the status quo, but has fallen in line with the Republican political establishment who have traditionally served the interests of multinationals and their hunting, fishing, mining and oil-drilling buddies at the expense of the environment.</p> <p>John McCain's choice may reassure hardline Republicans, but for many Americans she is a frightening prospect: an anti-environmentalist who puts special interests above science and whose policies make the Bush administration look progressive; a pro-life hunter who opposes abortion, even in the cases of rape and incest, yet kills other living creatures for entertainment; and a Christian fundamentalist who thinks that the Iraq war is \"God's task for America\". </p> <p>She certainly stirs strong emotions. As former New York mayor Ed Koch said: \"She scares the hell out of me.\"</p>",

  "<p>Securing the country's supply of electricity is more important than tackling climate change, a new report from energy analysts has claimed. It warned that the UK's economy could be wrecked if there was no action to plug the energy shortfall predicted for the next decade, with businesses going bust and hundreds of thousands of people losing their jobs. </p> <p>But the report, led by Ian Fells, emeritus professor at the University of Newcastle and a veteran energy policy analyst, has been dismissed as \"naive\" by Greenpeace, and \"overstated\" by the energy secretary John Hutton. Environmentalists argued that the report's recommendation for new coal-fired power stations went <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/04/climatechange.fossilfuels\">against the advice of scientists</a> and that the rest of the world was forging ahead with renewables.</p> <p>The report said the government had to consider extending the lifespan of the UK's ageing coal and nuclear power stations to meet the impending shortage. Otherwise, Fells warned, the UK would be be hit by repeated power cuts that would shut down public transport, reduce hospital services and cause chaos in supermarkets and offices. \"Electricity is the life blood of civilisation. Without it we spiral down into anarchy and chaos.\"</p> <p>Fells criticised proposed renewable energy schemes as being too optimistic in their promises and highlighted a long-term need for new nuclear power stations and coal-fired stations that were ready to fit <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/05/carboncapturestorage.carbonemissions1\">carbon-capture technology</a> to maintain future energy security in the UK.</p> <p>The impending energy gap will be caused by the closure of the UK's ageing nuclear and coal-fired power stations over the next decade. The report estimates the UK will lose a third of electricity generating capacity in this time. Candida Whitmill, a co-author of the report, said: \"Nuclear will not be ready, renewables will not be able to cope. Gas is getting politically and geographically dangerous to rely upon. Security of supply must take priority over everything including climate change.\"</p> <p>Fells said the situation was like \"watching a slow-motion train crash\" because government plans to plug the energy shortfall, such as rolling out huge wind farms, were impractical and filled with wishful thinking. Successive governments, said Fells, had failed to come up with any solutions and criticised the current UK energy policy as \"not fit for purpose\", warning that there could be severe consequences for the economy. \"We had a power cut in 2003 for about 12 hours in the City of London \u2013 the consequential loss was about \u00a3700m because everything stops. All your IT stops, the stock market doesn't work.\"</p> <p>Fells, who has long been a proponent of nuclear power, said that the upcoming crisis required some \"unpalatable\" short-term fixes. \"We will have to keep current nuclear power stations going long past their sell-by date. We will probably have to keep coal-fired stations that are coming to the end of their life. And that's no good for the environment.\" He also advocated building new gas-fired power stations that could be built quickly to shore up the supply and said that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/kingsnorth\">controversial coal-fired plant at Kingsnorth</a> in Kent would also be needed, though he said this should be made ready to fit technology to capture carbon dioxide and store it underground.</p> <p>Greenpeace chief Scientist Doug Parr criticised Fells' report for its \"long standing love affair with the technologies of the 20th century, but as time goes by [Fells'] fetish for coal and nuclear power looks increasingly na\u00efve. All over the world jobs are being created in the renewable energy sector, but Britain has been left behind for too long by the negative, white flag approach to climate change that this report represents. By proposing projects such as new coal fired power stations and the large scale conversion of coal to liquid fuel for use in aeroplanes, Fells has finally lost the backing of the scientific community.\"</p> <p>Responding to the report, energy secretary John Hutton said: \"Ensuring we have enough clean and secure energy is a national priority and fundamental to our future existence and prosperity. Ian Fells overstates the risk of the energy gap, but he also understates what the government's already doing to secure our future supplies and increase our energy independence - such as a tenfold increase in renewables, a renaissance of nuclear energy in the UK, and backing clean coal technology.\"</p> <p>He added: \"That's not to underestimate the task we've got on our hands. Securing future energy supplies for the UK is a matter of national security and so we're not going to rule out any radical options. That's why we keep our energy infrastructure under constant review, and will continue to take the tough decisions needed to ensure that we have reliable energy supplies in the decades ahead.\"</p> <p>Fells' report also suggested laying transmission lines to Norway, Germany and Denmark and also an additional line to France. \"That would mean we were properly connected up to Europe. That would add a great deal of comfort and security, provided there was someone there to make decisions.\" Greenpeace have backed a similar <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/04/windpower.renewableenergy\">North Sea grid proposal</a>.</p> <p>Over the longer term, Fells wants the UK to build more nuclear power stations and also give the go-ahead for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jun/12/conservation.wildlife1\">Severn Barrage</a>, a tidal generation system that could produce up to 5% of the UK's electricity needs. He defended his point that energy security was more important than climate change: \"You can't go on doing all the right things environmentally speaking if the whole of your system has crashed - it's more important.\"</p>",
  "<p>Phil Morgan is a man in demand. On the day we meet, the chief executive of the Tenant Participation Advisory Service - the not-for-profit consultancy which advises on tenant empowerment - has two back-to-back meetings about the government's new watchdog for social housing. As soon as they are over, he starts a tour of Peterborough, Birmingham and Leeds for yet more tenant consultation on the issue.</p> <p>The reason for this activity is a flurry of tenant-related initiatives from the government. The measures mean that Morgan, a veteran campaigner and advisor on tenants rights, has never been busier. The 48-year-old is playing a key role in how the new plans are shaping up and has some strong opinions on how those who live in social housing should be represented in the new tenant-focused landscape. The housing spotlight moved firmly onto tenants a year ago, with the publication of a government-commissioned review of social-housing regulations by Professor Martin Cave of Warwick Business School. The report, Every Tenant Matters, recommended a new watchdog for social housing tenants, the Tenant Services Authority (TSA). It also demanded more empowerment for England's 8.4m social housing residents, suggesting a new National Tenant Voice group to be their advocate. </p> <p>The authority is set to launch in December and will take on the regulatory work of the Housing Corporation when the latter becomes part of the new Homes and Communities Agency. Cave pointed out that tenants are not able to change landlords easily, so the new regulator needs a much greater focus on ensuring they receive good service. \"The TSA has to be prepared to push on tenant involvement in a way that the corporation didn't,\" says Morgan. \"The corporation doesn't put housing associations into supervision for poor tenant involvement.\" </p> <p><strong>Culture shock</strong></p> <p>The former corporation employees, who make up the bulk of the authority's staff, will need to undergo a culture change themselves - some \"quite fundamentally,\" says Morgan - if they are to drive through a sea change in attitudes in the housing sector at large. \"The most important thing is it can't be the Housing Corporation reheated,\" he says. The new chief executive, Peter Marsh, comes from the corporation and the chair; Anthony Mayer was the chief executive several years ago. Despite this, Morgan is encouraged because the two men have said that the new regulator must be very different to the old one.</p> <p>Morgan is clear about what the new authority's mission should be: to rid the housing sector of poor performing landlords who get the lowest inspection ratings. \"We still have far too many no- and one-star landlords. They are almost certainly people who are neither providing good tenant involvement nor good services,\" he says. He expects the TSA to be \"more robust\" about pushing poor performers to improve, or if necessary, handing the management of their homes to a better association. </p> <p>In alliance with several other groups, such as the Chartered Institute of Housing, the Tenant Participation Advisory Service has persuaded the government to bring local authority tenants under the wing of the new watchdog at the same time as housing association tenants. Morgan had feared that they would be, \"left behind as second class citizens\" if they joined the system at a later date. The sector will still have to wait for Professor Ian Cole's impending report on cross-domain regulation to see how the system will work in practice for different groups of tenants. \"We will need to be vigilant that the new regulatory approach feels the same to tenants, irrespective of whether they are a housing association or local authority tenant,\" he cautions.</p> <p>The guardian angel whispering in the ear of the new regulator will be the National Tenant Voice, due to be launched next year. Morgan describes it as being \"tenant driven and tenant-led,\" where as the regulatory TSA will not be heavily influenced by tenant views. The National Tenant Voice will boost the grassroots tenant movement and in the future, he hopes, will also represent private sector tenants as well as leaseholders, tenants and shared owners in social housing. \"We have been concerned for some time that private tenants are most excluded from any involvement,\" he says. \"I think that [including them in the National Tenant Voice and TSA] is a little way off yet, a next parliament issue. But there needs to be something that brings private rented tenants into the involvement opportunities and social housing is a mechanism for doing so.\"</p> <p><strong>Guaranteed involvement</strong></p> <p>Another quiet victory for the Tenant Participation Advisory Service was the promise in the recent empowerment white paper that the government would review tenant participation compacts. The compacts, produced and rolled out by the service, were designed to guarantee local authority involvement with their tenants but government had allowed them to \"whither on the vine,\" says Morgan. However, he thinks they have a future in the new tenant-centred regulatory world and could provide a framework for a strong landlord-tenant relationship, which the TSA could encourage and enforce.</p> <p>The Tenant Participation Advisory Service's \u00a32.5m turnover and membership - made up of 300 social landlords and 1,000 tenant and resident groups - have remained fairly stable for the last five years. Morgan says that the organisation is \"busier than ever, given the current government focus on tenants.\" He has been at the helm of the service for nine years and is a well-known figure in the tenant participation movement, but he started his housing career on the other side of the fence as a civil servant in the Merseyside taskforce, set up by the Conservative government in the wake of the Toxteth riots in 1981. The fact that Morgan was briefly a council tenant in a flat in the Hulme area of Manchester at the time when it was still known for its social problems - he is \"truly glad\" the block was demolished - means he has first-hand knowledge of what it is like to be a tenant.</p> <p>Issues that concern tenants, Morgan says, include anti-social behaviour, repairs and maintenance and the decent homes standard - the government's pledge to get all social housing up to a decent state by 2010. Morgan adds: \"The state of the economy has started to become more important now, particularly if unemployment starts to rise.\" However, he explains that the reduction in house prices, an issue that is dominating other parts of the housing sector, is not generally of concern to tenants who rent.</p> <p>Alongside the day jobs, Morgan has done a range of voluntary work, including being a board member of a housing association and a stint as a Labour councillor and vice chair of housing, when he agreed Trafford council's first tenant participation budget. \"The housing movement depends on people giving their time and the fact I have done that and continue to do it is important to me empathising with what people do themselves,\" he says. </p> <p><strong>Weblink</strong></p> <p>Tenant Participation Advisory Service: <a href=\"http://www.tpas.org.uk\">tpas.org.uk</a></p> <h2>CV: Phil Morgan</h2> <p><strong>Age:</strong> 48</p> <p><strong>Education: </strong>University of Manchester, BSc (Liberal Studies in Science), Thorpe grammar school in Norwich</p> <p><strong>Employment: </strong>1999 to present, chief executive Tenant Participation Advisory Service; 1998 to 1999, assistant director Centre for Local Economic Strategies; 1998, head of operations North West Development Agency; 1992 to 1998, Merseyside taskforce (education team, Liverpool housing action trust sponsor team and derelict land grant team including part-time secondment to English Partnerships); 1982 to 1992, Department of Environment and Transport</p> <p><strong>Positions: </strong>Member of Cave Review external advisory group; member of the National Tenant Voice project group and Cross Domain Regulation working party, 1986 to 1992, councillor Trafford council; 1996 to 2000, chair of governors Old Trafford community school; 2003 to 2005, board member New Prospect Housing</p> <p><strong>Interests:</strong> sport, gym, bridge</p>",
  "<p>Iraq is being flooded with weapons despite human rights violations by all parties in the conflict there, and without any proper monitoring by the US and Britain over where the weapons end up, Amnesty International says today.</p> <p>There is no clear accountable audit trail for some 360,000 small arms supplied to the Iraqi security forces, many by the US and UK, it says. Subcontracting makes the arms trade even less transparent. Among examples cited by Amnesty are the supply of 63,800 Kalashnikov assault rifles from Bosnia to Iraq and the dispatch via the UK of thousands of Italian Beretta pistols, many of which ended up in the hands of al-Qaida insurgents in Iraq.</p> <p>\"The easy availability of small arms and lack of accountability in Iraq has contributed to sectarian killings by armed groups, as well as torture and other ill-treatment; extra-judicial executions by Iraqi government forces and the continuing arbitrary detention of thousands of suspects by Iraqi soldiers backed by US armed forces since 2003,\" says Amnesty.</p> <p>It adds: \"Very serious failures have occurred in the effective management of huge quantities of weapons and munitions supplied to Iraq since 2003. While Iraqi officials ... have been primarily responsible, a significant share of the responsibility rests with the US and UK coalition forces and their contractors.\"</p> <p>According to US state department figures this week, Iraq has signed more than $3bn worth of arms deals in the past two years. Amnesty estimates that more than 1m small arms have been sold to Iraq since the 2003 invasion and the Iraqi government plans to procure more than 250,000 from the US and China.</p> <p>This trade would have been controlled, and the supply of weapons pouring into other conflict zones - notably Burma and Darfur in Sudan - prevented had an arms trade treaty been in place, Amnesty says.</p> <p>Weapons are flowing into Darfur despite a UN embargo, it says in a 125-page report, Blood at the Crossroads, which sets out the case for a robust arms trade treaty due to be discussed at the UN next month. It says that on February 19 this year, two Chinese Fantan fighter jets were used in an attack on Beybey in Darfur and three large bombs were dropped on a settlement killing eight people, including children. The aircraft had recently been serviced by Chinese technicians and their Sudanese pilots allegedly trained in China to fly them.</p> <p>Russia has agreed to supply 27 helicopters to Sudan, says Amnesty. Last year, Sudan listed its main arms suppliers as China, Russia, North Korea, Belarus, Indonesia, Iran and Malaysia.</p> <p>Meanwhile, countries including China, Russia, Ukraine and Serbia have been providing huge quantities of arms to Burma despite human rights violations said by the UN to be widespread and systematic. UN arms embargoes continue to be flouted in Ivory Coast and Somalia, while arms supplies to Colombia, Guatemala, Guinea, Chad and Uganda show the \"catastrophic human rights consequences of unrestrained arms trading\", Amnesty says.</p> <p>Kate Allen, Amnesty International's UK director, said: \"Next month's decision at the UN is crucial. Governments around the world cannot go on ignoring the untold suffering and dreadful abuses caused by irresponsible global arms transfers. World leaders have to uphold their obligations on human rights and to move forward on an international arms trade treaty which is underpinned by the 'golden rule' on human rights.\"</p> <p>Amnesty describes the golden rule as countries undertaking not to approve the supply of \"conventional weapons, munitions, military equipment or assistance, where there is a substantial risk that such items will be used for serious violations of international human rights\".</p> <p>Last week, David Miliband, the foreign secretary, committed himself to pressing for an effective treaty, Amnesty says. But the proposal is opposed by countries such as China while others, including India, Pakistan and the US, are attempting to block, delay or dilute the plans, which would allow the trade in arms to continue unchecked, Amnesty says.</p>",
  "<p>Shell and BP have been warned by investors that their involvement in unconventional energy production such as Canada's oil sands could turn out to be the industry's equivalent of the sub-prime lending that poisoned the banking sector and triggered the current financial crisis.</p> <p>The criticism came as a report was released yesterday warning of the potential financial risks of tar sands, and members of the UK Social Investment Forum met in London to consider a Co-op Investments campaign on halting oil industry involvement in the carbon-intensive oil projects. </p> <p>The report, BP and Shell, Rising Risks in Tar Sands Investment, co-authored by Greenpeace and fellow campaign group Platform, argues that oil majors are trying to make up a shortfall in conventional reserves by an irresponsible dash to extract oil from bitumen and other sources.</p> <p>Mark Hoskin, senior partner at the ethical investment advisers Holden &amp; Partners, expressed concern about the increasing focus on tar sands at a time when oil companies are being shut out of traditional drilling areas such as Russia and Venezuela. </p> <p>\"The recent banking crisis has shown how the financial markets can totally misjudge both the risks and values inherent in company balance sheets,\" he said. \"Oil companies depend on oil reserves for their market values. BP and Shell are two of our most trusted UK stocks, but it is a shocking fact that 30% of Shell's oil reserves are in tar sands.</p> <p>\"This report unveils how dangerous this approach is. There is a good chance that tar sands could be to the oil industry what sub-prime lending was to the banking sector.\"</p> <p>The report lists trends moving against investment in this area, not least the decline in the price of oil at a time when the cost of developing tar sand schemes is rising, something highlighted recently by the boss of French oil group Total.</p> <p>The price of crude has plunged on world markets, with Brent blend briefly yesterday below $90 a barrel, down from nearly $150 in July, as traders fear that ructions on Wall Street following the collapse of Lehman Brothers will spread into the mainstream economy and drag down oil demand.</p> <p>The report by the environmental campaigners also claims that low-carbon fuel standards under consideration by US presidential candidate Barack Obama and already implemented in California threaten to shut down sections of the American market to products derived from tar sands.</p> <p>John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace, said his organisation had always known that tar sands were a risk to the climate \"but now it's becoming clear that they're a risk to the bottom line as well\". Platform called on BP and Shell to rethink their entire energy strategy.</p> <p>The criticism came as 20 members of the UK Social Investment Forum, a group of ethical investors, attended the Co-op Investments-backed meeting. The Co-op has called for a halt to new licensing of tar sands projects which, it believes, will tip the world into an irreversible process of global warming.</p> <p>Paul Monaghan, head of social goals and sustainability at the Co-op, said the group was drawing increasing support and talks were planned with a wider group of investors. He expressed concern that BP and Shell had declined to attend yesterday and hoped they would be at future meetings.</p> <p>Greenpeace and Platform say in their report that other risks to tar sands developments come from elections being held in Canada that could affect the regulatory climate, given that the opposition Liberal party is a strong supporter of a carbon tax. The NGOs also point to an \"unrealistic\" reliance on untested carbon capture and storage technology, which has been highlighted by Shell as a means for reducing CO2 emissions.</p> <p>The Canadian tar sands are estimated to contain as much as 180bn barrels of oil but the environmental groups warn that extracting bitumen and upgrading it to synthetic crude oil is three to five times more greenhouse gas intensive than conventional oil extraction.</p> <p>Upgrading a single barrel of tar sand bitumen for use in a conventional refinery also requires 14 cubic metres of natural gas, leading to huge demand for gas and supply infrastructure in remote regions of Canada. Enormous amounts of water are also needed in the process.</p> <p>Shell argues that growing world demand for energy leaves society with little choice other than to exploit new forms of oil such as tar sands. </p> <p>BP, which insists it is still committed to the greener agenda set under former chief executive Lord Browne, said unconventional sources had the advantage of being located in politically stable countries such as Canada and it remained confident of the economics even at an oil price of $90 a barrel.</p> <p>The company, now led by Tony Hayward, believes it can reduce its overall carbon footprint by keeping away from surface mining and being careful about the way it brings oil out of the ground. It insists it factored in the future costs of carbon in its tar sands projects.</p> <h2>Carbon count</h2> <p>The campaign against tar sands began in summer after joint research by <strong>Co-op Investments </strong>and the <strong>WWF </strong>concluded that unconventional fuels could tip the world into unstoppable climate change. More than $125bn (\u00a370bn) is to be spent by 2015 on such extraction schemes, which are highly carbon, energy and water intensive.</p> <p>Environmental campaigners including <strong>Greenpeace </strong>director John Sauven, pictured right, say tar sands can be five times as carbon-heavy as normal oil extraction but Shell, BP and others in the field say they can dramatically reduce their impact through careful production methods and by using innovative technology for <strong>carbon capture and storage</strong> (CCS).</p> <p>NGOs dispute these arguments and are particularly sceptical about the CCS argument, given that some experts believe it may still prove too expensive and operationally difficult for <strong>large-scale mining</strong></p> <p>Shell led the charge into tar sands, which was deemed too costly by BP's former chief executive <strong>Lord Browne</strong>. New boss <strong>Tony Hayward </strong>thinks otherwise at a time when his company desperately needs to replenish reserves and resource nationalism </p> <p>is threatening traditional sources. The Co-op claimed after yesterday's meeting that an increasing number of oil firm investors were waking up to the risks of tar sands.</p>",

Who understands that?</p> <p>The truly sad thing is that all this is taking place with a so-called Labour government in power, a government that should have the interests of the majority at heart, but has instead played the role of a pimp. </p> <p>Maybe a bit of a recession will do us some good. A lot of people have been living beyond their means. We've all done it, I've done it: you feel a bit depressed, you go and buy something. People might now actually talk to each other a bit more, make their own entertainment, all those other great northern cliches. The tragedy is that it will be the ordinary people who will bear the brunt. The guys who are responsible may have to sell the yacht.</p> <h2>Salma Yaqoob</h2> <p><strong>Birmingham City councillor</strong></p> <p>This crisis opens up possibilities for alternative economic models as the wheels come off this one, but I'm worried about the immediate social consequences. A leaked report from the Home Office a couple of weeks ago referred to a rise in racism and social tensions. My concern is that we'll now see some ugly racist scapegoating as politicians try to pass the buck.</p> <p>When the markets were being treated as gods, we were always being promised that there'd be a trickle-down of prosperity. But all that's trickled down has been a greed-is-good philosophy. The consequence is a more unequal, self-centred, crueller Britain. It's important that we should reflect on the kind of society we've become, but also on the kind of society we want to be. Recently, Unicef reported that Britain's children are the unhappiest in Europe, and I think that is not unconnected to an economic climate that forces parents to work longer and longer hours. We hear a lot of talk about youth and gangs and guns; what we don't talk about are the economic policies that would allow families to nurture each other and make young people feel valued.</p> <p>The very people for whom it was a sacred othodoxy that there should be no government intervention are now coming to the government on their hands and knees begging for assistance. But what about the government intervening on behalf of ordinary people? Why not do something literally concrete on the ground and start building cheaper social housing? Why not put people at the centre of things? </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Salma Yaqoob is a Birmingham councillor and vice-chair of the Respect party</p> <h2>Ken Livingstone</h2> <p><strong>Former Mayor of London</strong></p> <p>Sadly, I don't think this will be the end of capitalism. But there is going to have to be a return to a much, much more interventionist state. As a system for the distribution and exchange of goods, you can't beat the market. But the mistake a lot of politicians have made is to think that because the market was good at that, it could be good at everything: it could train workers, create infrastructure, protect the environment, regulate itself. Quite obviously, it can't. </p> <p>So the real issue is, what sort of international structures do we need to ensure this never happens again? Thatcher and Reagan deregulated massively and let the financial markets do as they liked - and they've turned into one bloody great big rip-off. The good news is, there'll now be a realisation - even George Bush sees this now - that we need international regulatory mechanisms that will ensure, for example, that these people and operations actually pay tax. There'll be a realisation in Britain that while it's certainly useful to host a world financial centre, it has to rest on a solid, genuinely productive real economy. In China now they make things; we've decided we're not interested in that.</p> <h2>Bob and Roberta Smith</h2> <p><strong>Artist</strong></p> <p>Yesterday, at the same time as Lehman Brothers went belly up and Merrill Lynch was bailed out, Damien Hirst made \u00a370m. This tells us that capitalism is not dead. The rich got richer, and the poor got poorer - and in the evening, the rich went to an art sale and spent the small change in their pockets. This crisis is kind of like the capitalist cat shifting on its cushion. </p> <p>I don't buy the romanticism of the left: you can't kill capitalism, trade is how people operate. But I do think the left's analysis has to be coruscating and hard. The number-crunching, the smokescreens, that particular flavour of snake oil has to be finished; this has to be about real people now. There should be no self-congratulation, no, \"Oh good, they're getting their comeuppance,\" because behind every banker there are ordinary people in bigger trouble.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Bob and Roberta Smith is the pseudonym of artist Patrick Brill</p> <h2>Caroline Lucas</h2> <p><strong>Green MEP</strong></p> <p>This is a defining moment; the end of the kind of unbridled, deregulated capitalism of the past few decades. We are going to have to return finance to its role as servant rather than master of the global economy, and we're going to have to break up financial institutions into smaller units: mega-banks make mega-mistakes that affect us all.</p> <p>The way forward is the Green New Deal [co-formulated by, among others, Caroline Lucas and Guardian economics editor Larry Elliott]. We have to tackle a triple global crunch. In the face of a credit-fuelled financial crisis, we're going to have to re-regulate finance and taxation, clamp down on tax havens, split retail banking from merchant banking and securities trading. In the face of accelerating climate change, we have to face up to global warming. And in the face of an oil-price crisis, we're going to have to find the solutions to encroaching peak oil.</p> <p>The situation we're in now is an opportunity, although it remains an enormous threat also. It's the chance for us to move forward in a way that's sustainable economically and environmentally. This is about real people and real jobs, right now. I really wish we'd managed to get that message through before it happened. </p> <h2>Ken Loach</h2> <p><strong>Film director</strong></p> <p>This is further evidence, if any were needed, of the fact that the market is not and never can be the answer. (The need to pursue illegal wars is pretty strong evidence too, of course.) You look around the world and you see massive need on the one hand, and massive wealth on the other, and the two never connect. The market is massively inefficient, capitalism is massively unstable and turbulent, and it's insane that we are all bound to this terrible wheel of instability.</p> <p>The real left is making a lot of noise about this. There'll be a convention of the left during the Labour party conference, all the shades of genuine leftwing opinion, and we'll be hammering all these questions out from a socialist perspective. But if the papers and the broadcasters fail to record it, it's very difficult for these ideas to penetrate the public consciousness. The media just turns a deaf ear; it chooses not to hear it. It's a lot more interested in the careerism of whoever's after Gordon Brown's job.</p> <p>Will this be a defining moment for the left? It should be, of course but it's very difficult to be optimistic given our history of failure. The war against Iraq was a massive opportunity to create a coherent anti-capitalist movement, to find a real socialist alternative, and we let it slip through our fingers. This is another such opportunity, and we must not let it go. </p> <h2>Michel Onfray</h2> <p><strong>Philosopher</strong></p> <p>Is this the end of capitalism? Absolutely not. The key feature of capitalism is that it's malleable. It has been through antiquity, feudalism, the industrial era, it has worn the guise of fascism and now it's wedding itself to the ecology cause. After this latest event, it will take on a new form. It is indestructible and works like the Hydra of Lerne, cut off one head and another grows in its place. Is this the end of society's obsession with money and credit? Not at all.</p> <h2>Chris Harman</h2> <p><strong>Socialist Workers Party</strong></p> <p>This is a very, very serious crisis of capitalism: it has been the build-up of private borrowing that has kept the system going, and it's coming unstuck. The whole system is unwinding; the other day we saw the biggest nationalisation in the history of humanity and that still wasn't enough. Governments don't know what to do, and it's the rest of us who have to live with the consequences. The Labour party is offering no alternative, the Lib Dems are offering no alternative, the Conservatives are offering no alternative.</p> <p>This could be a big moment for the left. But we really need to stand up and use the \"c\" word, say this is a crisis of capitalism and that people are suffering. The thing is, all the media coverage yesterday was of the bankers leaving Lehman Brothers with their boxes, but the people who will really be hit are the cleaners, the secretaries - what did we see of them? We have to build resistance. Because so far we've only seen the minor problems; people stuck in foreign airports or having a bit of trouble getting a job. Things are going to get much, much worse.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Chris Harman is the editor of International Socialism (SWP)</p> <h2>George Monbiot</h2> <p><strong>Green campaigner</strong></p> <p>It's only in times of crisis that people are prepared to contemplate taking to the streets. It was noticeable that there were a lot more protests - against road developments, for instance, and against the Criminal Justice Act and other infringements of civil rights - in the wake of the 1991 recession than there were in the mid-90s, when people were feeling richer. Some people, faced with recession, tend to hunker down, but others confront the government and demand a better deal, and that gives the left hope.</p> <p>A Keynesian solution along the lines of Roosevelt's New Deal could deliver many of the things that the left is calling for - more public spending, more training and education. I'm particularly interested in the idea of a green new deal, which would employ large numbers of people to insulate homes and carry out major environmental works. Remember that the central plank in the New Deal was the Civilian Conservation Corps, which employed three million people.</p> <p>It is striking that the left has been slow to capitalise on the situation. There is now a good opportunity to build a common front between trade unions, disillusioned labour voters, greens and people who feel that their economic position is slipping. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist</p> <h2>Max Keiser</h2> <p><strong>Former broker</strong></p> <p>This is not a blip. It's extremely significant. We will see a shift in power away from the US, and towards the developing world - to countries such as Brazil and the Gulf states that have commodities to sell, and to China, where the savings ratio is high. We are going to see a new world order. America as a driver of the global economy is finished.</p> <p>The left has nothing to say about any of this. And because the left has no economic programme, we will see the rise of social unrest. We are already seeing it in the US. The left has no real response to that either. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Max Keiser is a former broker, and presenter of The Truth About Markets on Resonance FM</p> <h2>Tony Benn</h2> <p><strong>Former Labour minister</strong></p> <p> I remember the 1930s. What the Depression did then was to stimulate antisemitism. I met Oswald Mosley in 1928 when he was a Labour MP. The next time I met him he was wearing a blackshirt. Where there is fear, there is scapegoating, and that is very dangerous. </p> <p>Blair and Brown based their politics on a belief in the market: the market answered all your needs and the state had to be kept out. That confidence has now collapsed and New Labour is seen for what it is. You can't, as New Labour believed, nurse capitalism. </p> <p>I believe a new labour movement will emerge from this with a more realistic sense of how capitalism works. There is a left convention at this year's Labour conference, a sort of parallel conference. This year's Labour conference is the first in my lifetime when you will not be allowed to vote, so the left convention will get a lot of attention. At last, after a period when we've been told to trust the gamblers, there are many relevant ideas emerging on the left.</p> <h2>Lindsey German</h2> <p><strong>Stop the War coalition</strong></p> <p>This growing crisis will mean misery for working people and shows that everything we've been told about the free market has been false. At the same time, it's a big opportunity. Millions of people will be questioning why this has happened, what's wrong with the system, is it 1929 all over again? The left needs to put forward answers. People have the right to work; we have a housing crisis, so why not employ people to build more houses? We are facing great challenges, but there is also a historic opportunity for the left to remake itself. Capitalism has had its chance and failed; now it's socialism's turn.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Lindsey German is Convenor of the Stop the War Coalition and Left List candidate in this year's London Mayoral election</p> <h2>Sheila Rowbotham</h2> <p><strong>Socialist feminist </strong></p> <p>In the late 19th century and also in the 1930s, the impact of depression made people begin to question whether the free market and a completely unfettered form of capitalism was the best form of organising society. In both periods it encouraged on the left the idea of a complete social transformation through revolution, and also encouraged people to devise various schemes for social reform. The problem now - unlike in the 1880s, when people discovered the ideas of socialism, and in the 1930s, when it seemed that communism was the solution - is that the left doesn't have a coherent alternative vision.</p> <p>The Labour party has always been ambiguous about whether it is trying to make capitalism more efficient, or whether it is trying to soften its harshness. Since the 1970s, the left has been much weakened, as neoliberal ideas became totally ascendent. Under Blair, the idea that the Labour party was committed to any redistribution was pushed to the sidelines. I would like to see a new kind of left - a left that would relate to the present predicament. There is a consensus forming that says an unregulated financial system is a disaster, but whether that new left can be formed is questionable. I'd be very glad to see it happen.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Sheila Rowbotham is professor of gender and labour history at Manchester University</p> <h2>George Galloway</h2> <p><strong>Respect MP</strong></p> <p>I think the end of capitalism will be a process, not a single event. But each event we've seen so far has gone deeper than people have predicted, and we don't know how deep this one will go. It could well be that it marks the collapse of at least a major section of the capitalist economy: the financialisation of the economy that has been powering ahead since the deregulation and neo-liberalisation of the Thatcher-Reagan years. </p> <p>As far as the left is concerned, well, the Liberal Democrats have effectively moved to the right in the face of this week's events, and New Labour, with a few honourable exceptions, abandoned that territory a very long time ago. Now I would have thought - in fact, I know - that among the public in general there is a much bigger and a much wider audience for progressive ideas than there has been for some time. But what the left still has to overcome is its inability to speak in a language that ordinary people can understand. And to stop arguing about dead Russians.</p> <h2>Hari Kunzru</h2> <p><strong>Novelist</strong></p> <p>I'm in New York right now and the feeling here is quite visibly one of panic. I've just met, quite randomly, three people who were helping their friends clear their desks. Apparently, 12,000 jobs went, just like that, and Wall Street represents 20% of the city's jobs and something like 90% its tax base. So there's a definite sense here of systemic crisis.</p> <p>A great financial economist and historian called Michael Hudson talks about how the US economy is basically fictitious, based on pretend earnings and pretend values. This will only genuinely become a crisis of capitalism if people generally become aware that much of the growth and prosperity produced by capitalism is a fiction, and if the consensus about where the real global value lies shifts radically. In other words, if people stop believing that apparently wealthy countries actually are producing wealth. </p> <p>I don't immediately expect to be living in some kind of Mad Max world. But this could be the death knell of the time when we were all singing the beauties of free-market capitalism.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Additional interviews by Angelique Chrisafis</p>",
  "<p>Just like Sarah Palin, David Cameron would like to be seen as something of a novelty. Yet the strategy he is following is lifted from the US, Sweden, New Zealand and Canada. Rightwing parties there have adapted to the challenge posed by the modernised centre-left, coopting the language of their rivals while retaining traditional rightwing policies.</p> <p>In 1997, New Labour triumphed by recognising the extent to which the electoral landscape had changed. To recover, New Labour must now respond again. Constructing such a response will require two elements: first, an understanding and explicit recognition of the Conservative party's new approach; and second, an increase in strategic ambition to make the Conservatives rather than Labour the focus of a campaign.</p> <p>An effective strategy for Labour would start with an honest assessment of where the opponent is presently positioned. This would then look ahead to where Labour needs them to be positioned come the next election, and a series of messages would be designed that depositions them accordingly.</p> <p>Too often when faced with difficulties, political parties retreat to familiar strategies of the past. But simply to continue to attack the Conservatives on the same grounds as in the past two elections risks making Labour sound shrill, gaining little traction. </p> <p>Labour's response should be to honestly acknowledge Cameron's success: he has found a language and a tone that has allowed him to be heard by the people of Britain; he is asking questions that echo and reflect the concerns of many across the country; he has an ability to talk to those who are not traditional Conservatives in a way they can relate to, about issues that concern them; and he can communicate in a style that reminds many of Tony Blair.</p> <p>Labour would be wrong to underestimate the appeal of these changes. But equally it should not overestimate the extent to which in truth Cameron is a new Conservative.</p> <p>Instead, Labour should increase its strategic ambition. Current orthodoxy says Labour must turn the next election from a referendum on itself into a choice between the two parties. But starting from where the party is now, that will not be enough. A far bolder goal is required: we must make the next election a referendum on Cameron's Conservative party. </p> <p>Many perceive electoral strategy to be the offer of competing answers to the same question. In fact, electoral success usually goes to the party which most effectively defines the question voters are asking on polling day. Labour must ensure that the issue at the next election is whether the Tories have changed enough to be trusted.</p> <p>In 1992 the Tories achieved this to devastating effect, making Labour the issue, not themselves. But they could not do so again in 1997 because they made a strategic error: conceding Labour had changed, and that New Labour was a reality. Labour must not make that same error now. </p> <p>The fact is, the Conservative party remains fundamentally unreformed. Unlike Blair, Cameron has not taken on his party and has he not changed it. Labour's election victory in 1997 was the culmination of a process, begun by Neil Kinnock, to modernise its view of Britain and update its policies.</p> <p>In contrast, the modernity of Cameron's language has not been matched by reform of previously held policy positions. Cameron has not changed the Conservative party's view of the role of the state, or its view of public spending. Even during this time of global economic uncertainty, long-held doctrine continues to dictate Conservative party policy: just this week shadow chancellor George Osborne refused to say whether he would match Labour's plans for the next spending review period.</p> <p>In order to obscure this lack of fundamental change, Cameron has adopted a strategy of concealment. He will try to get as close as possible to the next election with as few policies as possible. In his language he seeks to hug Labour in order to smother differences and deny Gordon Brown the ability to define himself against his opponent. This has made life difficult for the prime minister.</p> <p>It will be very tempting for Labour to taunt the Conservative party for not knowing what it stands for. That would be a mistake. Labour must with confidence make the case that the Conservatives remain unreformed, that they remain a threat to Britain's families, their future prosperity and their public services. Every message must be in service of communicating that threat. To say the Conservatives have no policies fails that discipline - there is no threat from the Conservatives doing nothing.</p> <p>David Cameron has achieved much, but he has not fundamentally changed the Conservative party. His intentions are the same as his predecessors. He has not changed enough to win the trust of the British people at the next election - but it is up to Labour to make that case.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Spencer Livermore was a senior strategy adviser to Gordon Brown, 1998 to 2008</p>",
  "<p>In normal times the word Libor remains an esoteric term best left to the world of banking. But yesterday saw central banks around the world throw hundreds of billions of dollars, pounds and euros into money markets as Libor - the rate at which banks lend to each other - surged in response to the collapse of Lehman Brothers and worries over insurance group AIG.</p> <p>Looking at Libor is a bit like peering at what goes on under the bonnet of the banking machine. Yesterday things did not look pretty: the engine was overheating and came close to seizing up before big injections of lubricant from central banks kept it turning - just.</p> <p>Libor stands for the London inter-bank offered rate, and is the main interest rate in the London wholesale money market for pounds, dollars and euros. Unlike Bank rate, which is set by the Bank of England, Libor is set by the demand and supply of money as banks lend to each other to balance their books on a daily basis.</p> <p>Loan periods range from overnight up to one year and it is used to price all kinds of financial instruments including floating-rate mortgages. Instruments in several other currencies are also priced relative to Libor, such is the size of the London market.</p> <p>The focus yesterday was on the overnight Libor rate as banks, which normally spend all day buying and selling money from each other and thereby keep the wheels of global finance turning, again became reluctant to lend to other institutions in case they turned out to be another Lehman.</p> <p>Normally, overnight Libor tracks very closely central bank interest rates in their respective currencies, often running at 0.1 or 0.2 of a percentage point above them.</p> <p>Yesterday, overnight dollar Libor jumped to 6.4% in its daily fix by the British Bankers' Association, up from 3% on Monday. That rate was the highest since January 2001, when the Federal Reserve's official rate was 6%, compared with 2% now.</p> <p>In US money markets, dollar overnight money market rates jumped to above 10% at one point, more than five times the official Federal Reserve rate. </p> <p>The Fed flooded $70bn (\u00a339bn) of temporary liquidity into money markets, adding to the same amount it had provided on Monday. Although that was only half the amount the markets bid for, the move succeeded in pushing overnight rates back down to 2%.</p> <p>These daily injections are the biggest since September 2001, when the Fed moved to free up cash flowing to the financial system in the aftermath of the attacks on New York and Washington. </p> <p>In London, overnight sterling Libor, having jumped to well over 6% late last year in the early stages of the credit crunch, had been back very close to 5% - the normal high street rate - for the past few months.</p> <p>But yesterday morning, at its daily fixing by the British Bankers' Association, it leapt spectacularly to 6.8%. The Bank of England added \u00a320bn in liquidity to London markets as its contribution, adding to a \u00a35bn operation on Monday.</p> <p>There was little sign, though, that that was sufficient, because the offer of liquidity was three times over-subscribed.</p> <p>All of these rates mark exceptional times for highly stressed money markets and show the degree of strain that Lehman's collapse and the woes at AIG have caused.</p> <p>\"The banking crisis is not over and we have potentially a difficult few months to get through right to the end of this year,\" said Padhraic Garvey, strategist at ING Financial Markets.</p>",
  "<p>Goldman Sachs has rejected predictions of the death of the traditional Wall Street business model, in spite of the worst slump in the investment bank's profits since it went public in 1999. Third-quarter earnings dived 70% to $810m (\u00a3450m) as the credit crunch crippled financial markets and the firm's usual flow of advisory fees on corporate deals evaporated.</p> <p>But by remaining in the black, Goldman fared better than most of its rivals and senior executives rejected suggestions that the standalone structure of Wall Street banks was under threat.</p> <p>\"It's not the business model, it's the performance that matters,\" said Goldman's chief financial officer, David Viniar. \"We have, and always will, make our share of mistakes - but we will protect our franchise at all costs.\"</p> <p>Viniar said Goldman's 32,600 employees had \"a lot of compassion\" for those who lost their jobs this week when Lehman Brothers collapsed. Lehman's demise followed the implosion of Bear Stearns and came as Merrill Lynch surrendered its independence to Bank of America.</p> <p>\"We're not happy about what has happened,\" said Viniar. \"We feel for the people in these institutions. They were very good institutions which made mistakes, and got caught up in a terrible market.\" Goldman's investment banking division suffered a 40% fall in revenue to $1.29bn, including a 56% plunge in financial advisory fees, blamed on an industry-wide decrease in mergers and acquisitions.</p> <p>In its trading and principal investments division, the bank's revenue plunged by 67% to $2.7bn. Goldman revealed that it made a $500m loss on residential mortgage-related securities and a $325m loss on commercial mortgages. Its principal investments operation made a $453m loss, largely due to corporate and property investments.</p> <p>But Viniar said Goldman had no inclination to follow Merrill by linking up with a high street bank to improve its funding options, insisting that the firm had all the access to capital that it needs.</p> <p>Until recently, Goldman was viewed as one of Wall Street's few winners from the global credit crunch. It made a record profit last year because its traders correctly forecast a slump in the sub-prime mortgage industry.</p> <p>Experts say that the collapse in the credit market and evaporation of</p> <p>deal-making activity have inevitably taken its toll. \"The business is just not happening and therefore Goldman can't take advantage of what doesn't exist,\" Richard Bove, a banking analyst at Ladenburg Thalmann, told Bloomberg News.</p> <p>Anxious to prove that it, too, could prosper in a difficult environment, Morgan Stanley last night rushed out figures showing that its quarterly profits had slipped by just 8% to $1.42bn.</p> <p>Morgan Stanley's chief financial officer, Colm Kelleher, said the markets were facing \"unprecedented challenges\" but insisted that the firm had proven its ability to succeed through the ups and downs of business cycles.</p>",
  "<p>Few people can have done so much to transform other people's lives as Penny Wade, who has died aged 78. As a founder member of the National Childbirth Trust, she promulgated the new thinking that altered women's experience of pregnancy and motherhood. She also worked with the homeless, and, in her home area of Richmond, Surrey, built up a network of services to support vulnerable single people.</p> <p>She was born Penelope Ladds, at Frenchay, near Bristol, daughter of an army officer whose postings took him to India, and later Burma. As war came and the threat of a Japanese invasion mounted, he sent his wife and two children to safety. They had to leave hurriedly, and Penny remembered crouching to avoid the bullets on the floor of the railway carriage as bandits attacked the train from Chittagong to Calcutta. The journey back to Britain, too, was eventful; two ships in their convoy were torpedoed. </p> <p>Penny trained as a nurse at St George's hospital, in London, and worked there for some years, meeting her ebullient Australian husband Robin, a designer, when he was a patient on her ward. Her own pregnancy, while they were living in Denmark, brought her into contact with fresh ideas about natural childbirth. Then, in 1956, by chance she saw an advertisement that Prunella Briance had put in the Times asking anyone interested in forming an association for the promotion of natural childbirth to contact her. </p> <p>Thus Penny became one of the small group of founders of the Natural Childbirth Association (NCA) and played an important role over the following years as it grew to become the National Childbirth Trust (NCT). It is difficult to overstate the difference that this movement has made to women's experience of childbearing and the early stages of motherhood. Before, a medical model had dominated the maternity hospitals, a mother's role was largely passive, and husbands were kept far from the action. </p> <p>Penny's particular concern in those early days was training: teaching mothers, but also health professionals and their teachers, about preparation for natural childbirth.</p> <p>A new interest, flowing from this work, was housing for single mothers, and this brought Penny to the national charity Shelter. In 1977, she took a job setting up and running a drop-in centre in Richmond for lonely or vulnerable people, some with mental health problems, on probation, homeless or otherwise on the margins of society. The Vineyard Project, as it was called, provided a welcoming environment for all-comers. With a friend, Penny founded a local furniture exchange, later to become a wider scheme to recycle surplus furniture to people in need. </p> <p>The growing number of single homeless people - 80 on one count - in Richmond for whom no bed could be found became increasingly troubling, and when, in 1986, two men at the project died while sleeping rough, Penny gathered a team from local groups, churches and professions who planned and secured funding for, first, a night shelter and, later, move-on accommodation and a permanent short-stay hostel. Spear (Single Person's Emergency Accommodation in Richmond) prospered and grew under her chairmanship.</p> <p>Penny was a staunch Labour supporter and pacifist, went on CND marches and later campaigned against the Iraq war. In the 1990s she took an active role in the National Assembly of Women, and was a trustee of the Richmond Parish Lands Charity, became involved with meeting asylum-seekers' needs, and set up a local homelessness forum.</p> <p>She is survived by Robin, a son, two daughters and five grandchildren. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Penelope Wade, social activist, born March 16 1930; died July 22 2008</p>",
  "<p>Storm clouds are gathering over Cornwall's granite spine as campaigners battle to retain open access and prevent thousands of metres of barbed wire being erected on of West Penwith moor, one of England's wildest and most dramatic places. </p> <p>The moor is a designated area of outstanding natural beauty, a world heritage site, and is one of the most influential landscapes in 20th-century British art - immortalised by the work of Barbara Hepworth and Sir Terry Frost, to name two. </p> <p>The problem is that Natural England - the government agency with a remit \"to conserve and enhance the natural environment\" - has joined with the National Trust, Penwith council and Cornwall county council in proposing a new \"sustainable\" grazing scheme that will introduce cattle and include electric fences, modern gates, water troughs, cattle grids, and new road signs. Objectors argue that any attempt to tamper, tidy, cultivate or refine - beyond repairing what is already there - will inevitably diminish Penwith's historic integrity. </p> <p>The plan is part of a wider north-west European initiative known as the Heath (heathland, environment, agriculture, tourism, heritage) project, funded by the EU and the Heritage Lottery Fund. The objective is to halt decline in heathland and to increase biodiversity by subsidising farmers to graze cattle to control scrub, gorse and bracken on a scheme known as \"high level stewardship\".</p> <p>In all, there are 32 separate areas on the Land's End peninsula earmarked for the project, but it represents the biggest human intervention in living memory to West Penwith's moorland, and is a radical change of policy after 20 years of the current environmentally sensitive area scheme, which has always adopted a \"hands off\" monitoring approach. </p> <p>At the heart of this protest is a clash of values between professional conservationists and people who use the moor regularly. The former group, concerned about the neglect and spread of gorse and bracken, are poised and eager to employ their \"best practice\" manuals on \"enhancing\" the moorland habitat. But they are opposed by large numbers of people who are unconvinced that it is either necessary or desirable to tamper with the moor in this way, and who argue that the value of this landscape lies in its raw simplicity. </p> <p>Peter Bowden, Cornwall's management team leader for Natural England, says ideas on how to preserve the moor best have evolved . \"The environmentally sensitive area schemes were our first stab at environmental management, and I think as time goes on we try to improve on what we have done before,\" he argues. \"Protecting biodiversity is our objective, and with gorse and bracken you do not get the same diversity of plants or animals.\" </p> <p>A recent statement by Bowden in the local press that an \"accidental or deliberate\" gorse fire could lead to \"a wall of flames heading towards people's cottages\" unless cows were grazed was dismissed by campaigners, fiercely opposed to the scheme, as political scaremongering. \"Natural England's case is crumbling under the sheer weight of the opposition to it,\" says Save Penwith Moors (SPM) campaigner Craig Weatherhill, formerly a conservation officer for Penwith council. \"They are reverting to trying to win their case by frightening the public. </p> <p>\"This is not an ecology project. It's about modern governmental, quangoid thinking that means now even areas of wilderness must be managed. It will utterly change the wild character of the moor by introducing cattle. Grazing will oust the present wildlife and replace it with another. This cannot be acceptable.\" </p> <p>Jon Brookes, National Trust's property manager for West Penwith, claims grazing would \"bring the moors alive\". He says: \"You can't walk on the moors because you will be ripped apart, but the cattle make tracks in the gorse and stop it being so dominant. I've got surveys a metre thick that prove this is the right way forward, and you will not find a conservationist who will tell you otherwise. We don't have the resources to control gorse by hand. Grazing animals is the most sustainable way.\"</p> <p>Bart O'Farrell, member of the Cornwall Archaeological Society, disagrees. \"Right to roam is being damaged,\" he says. \"The geology of the land is being damaged by fences - and fencing means ownership. Once they're in, it's really difficult to get rid of that.\"</p> <p>Local MP Andrew George is also taking a close interest in the issues. \"Many of my constituents are concerned that the plans would destroy the amenity and informality of these areas with regimented barbed wire electric fencing,\" he says. \"As far as I am aware, grazing cattle do not make any impact on bracken, gorse or Japanese Knotweed, as they don't eat these.\"</p> <p><strong>Negative visual impact</strong></p> <p>Critics say any benefits from the project are outweighed by the negative visual impact, curtailment of people's rights, and the raft of health and safety issues - not least, the possibility of cattle straying on to the notoriously fog-bound coast road. \"It's been very badly thought through,\" says the SPM campaign coordinator, author Ian McNeil Cooke. \"Tourism is the life blood of this area. The magical feeling of freedom while walking the moors will be lost if it goes ahead.\"</p> <p>Of particular concern to the campaigners is the proposed enclosure, for grazing, of the three popular, archaeologically-rich areas that have always had open access: Nine Maidens Common, near Madron; Carn Kenidjack, above St Just; and Carn Galva, above Bosigran. </p> <p>On Sunday, SPM is planning to hold a moorland \"protest walk\", and has recently had a display in St Just, with photographs and maps. \"Hundreds of people came,\" Mc Neil Cooke says. \"It's always that same amazed reaction we get when people realise the scope of the project. So far we have a petition of over 600 residents.\"</p> <p>It is the unique, indefinable quality of the area that campaigners fear will be lost. \"For many, these areas are an important artistic inspiration that can create a spiritual connection with the numerous prehistoric sacred sites and natural granite outcrops that dot this ancient landscape,\" says McNeil Cooke. \"These moors should be left alone. Their enclosure will be a disaster not easily undone.\"</p>",
  "<p>How must we change our approach to urban design if we are to create economically, culturally and environmentally sustainable communities that are truly inclusive and reflect the aspirations of today's diverse society? That was the question posed last week at the 2008 Stephen Lawrence Memorial Lecture.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/joepublic/2008/sep/11/communities\">Peter Morrison</a>, chief executive of RMJM Architects, who introduced the debate at the Royal Institute of British Architects (Riba), said change is difficult because architects are drawn from a homogenous pool of white middle-class talent. People who have never lived in a troubled inner-city area, he argued, cannot hope to regenerate it. Lawrence, who was stabbed to death in a racist attack 15 years ago, was an aspiring architect, but few students from black and ethnic minority backgrounds join the profession. Morrison's proposed solution is to train and employ architects who grew up in deprived communities (RMJM is working with the Stephen Lawrence Centre to promote architecture as a career goal for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds). </p> <p>Enter designer Wayne Hemingway. Not exactly an architect by trade, the Red or Dead founder swapped designing trendy footwear for social housing more than a decade ago when he sold his internationally known label. But he did study geography and town planning under Sir Peter Hall and has strong opinions - drawing on the Lancashire working-class environment he and his wife grew up in - on what constitutes sustainable communities. His family's first home in Blackburn was in a tower block, and his fond memories of playing football and cricket, and \"cardboarding\" down manmade mini-hills in the landscaped park that surrounded the flats have shaped his views on the importance of public space. Likewise, his wife's family's terrace house in Padiham had a tiny back yard that opened on to the communal \"reccy\" where today the community still plays.</p> <p>For Hemingway, architecture is not about buildings but about friends and acquaintances. Nor is sustainability about solar panels, wind turbines or other green gadgets designed to reduce a property's carbon footprint - as he says many architects seem to think - but about happiness, putting down roots and feeling at home. He has tried to instil that sense of community in the housing developments he has designed, incorporating features ranging from communal barbecues to ping-pong tables. And he is critical of UK planners and housebuilders, drawing parallels between Britain's high levels of obesity and youth crime and housing developments devoid of decent spaces for play. </p> <p>Hemingway has adopted many ideas about sustainability from Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands, which he says offer superior play spaces. But do they have more architects who are black or from ethnic minorities or poor backgrounds? The answer is probably not. While it is true that someone who better understands the needs of a community may produce better designs for them, it is surely simplistic to say lack of diversity is the reason why our housing developments have since the 60s been, in Hemingway's words, \"pretty shite\". </p> <p>Whether it's housing associations selling off play areas to subsidise urgently needed social housing, or schools disposing of playing fields to private developers to fund better facilities, a lack of adequate public investment is the problem. All professions should reflect the diverse society they serve, whether it be teaching, social work or medicine. And helping cover the costs of training is one way to achieve this - few can afford to train for seven years to become an architect. But let's not fool ourselves that having a more diverse architectural workforce is a panacea for creating sustainable housing developments.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Alison Benjamin is deputy editor of Society Guardian.</p>",
  "<p>By tonight, the governing party should have a new leader. After a painful summer limping along with an unpopular prime minister - who never came close to matching the popularity of his predecessor - the party will today have the leadership contest and the fresh start it has yearned for. </p> <p>No, that's not a prediction of the imminent fate of Gordon Brown and Labour, but a description of events already under way in Israel. The unpopular PM is Ehud Olmert, who will today be replaced as leader of the ruling Kadima party in a ballot of its 74,000 members. Unless both fail to cross the 40% threshold, either foreign minister Tzipi Livni or former defence minister Shaul Mofaz will be invited to form a coalition and take over as PM. </p> <p>Polls favour Livni, who, after the failures of S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal and Hillary Clinton, might well be the best chance we'll get to see another woman reach the political pinnacle this side of President Palin. Don't count on it, though: Israeli primaries are notoriously difficult to call, determined more by grassroots organisation and unseen horsetrading than by national standing. </p> <p>The world's diplomats are certainly rooting for Livni, believing that her involvement in the last year of negotiations makes her the best hope for peace between Israelis and Palestinians. She has impressed even her adversaries in those talks, leading a team described as serious and professional: one Palestinian calls Livni a \"master negotiator\". </p> <p>If she now steps into the top job, that must bode well, bringing the long promised two-state solution within reach, right? Wrong. Conversations with those who have been involved on the diplomatic frontline for more than 15 years, those who have made the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel their life's work, suggest a new despair. With a heavy heart, they are concluding that the two-state solution is dead. </p> <p>I sat down this week with Shlomo Ben-Ami, Israel's former foreign minister and lead negotiator at the failed peace talks at Camp David in 2000. He would prefer Livni to Mofaz, but he's past believing it will make any great difference. No longer does he think that the effort to reach an agreement with the Palestinians - a project which has endured, on and off, since the Oslo accords of 1993 - depends on having this or that person in charge. The serial failures are not \"technical\", but structural, built into the conflict. </p> <p>On the Israeli side, the troubles begin with a system designed for paralysis. Under an absurdly pure form of proportional representation, coalitions are inevitable, with small, often extreme parties exerting veto power over larger ones. </p> <p>What's more, the corruption inquiries that dogged Olmert also hobbled his predecessors. Under Israel's strict legal rules a PM can be indicted for actions taken long before he reached office. \"We have Mediterranean politicians and a Germanic judicial system,\" smiles Ben-Ami. Any leader who inches towards compromise with the Palestinians knows Israel's hawks will be ready to call the police, armed with a file of dirt. Little wonder that not a single illegal outpost on the occupied West Bank, let alone a fully fledged settlement, has been dismantled in the past eight years. \"Politics consistently defeats statesmanship in our system,\" says the former foreign minister. </p> <p>Things are not much better on the Palestinian side. The nation is split, with Hamas ruling Gaza and Fatah dominant in the West Bank, and it is a truism that Mahmoud Abbas is weak. But it's not just a leadership problem, says one Palestinian negotiator, also a veteran of the campaign for a two-state solution. \"You don't even have a Palestinian national movement,\" he says. The only movement is Islamic: Hamas. Fatah and the PLO are \"hollow shells\". Abbas lacks the national stature of Yasser Arafat; he cannot simply impose his will. Any deal he accepts has at least to come close to the demands of Hamas. </p> <p>The result is that the two sides are like a pair of acrobats who can stretch every sinew to bend over backwards - but still not touch. As Ben-Ami puts it: \"The Israeli maximum will always fall short of the Palestinian minimum.\"</p> <p>But what of the polls that show clear majorities on both sides in favour of two states? These are so-called passive majorities, the sentiment of a public who wouldn't object if an accord came along but won't lift a finger to effect it. Meanwhile, on both sides stand impassioned minorities, whether Jewish settlers or jihadist militants, who will do whatever it takes to thwart the compromise any peace deal would require. </p> <p>The result is deep gloom among the peacemakers. They search now for a \"new paradigm\". Could that be a single, binational state? \"A nightmare,\" says Ben-Ami, a South Africa situation with no hope of a South Africa solution, given the presence of two national groups equal in number. More unilateral Israeli withdrawals are similarly doomed: after what followed the Israeli pullout from Gaza in 2005 - a Hamas takeover - there would be little support for a similar move in the West Bank. </p> <p>Instead, there is renewed interest in an old, and once discredited, idea: the Jordanian option. Advocates say Israel would surely feel happier conceding the West Bank to a stable state such as Jordan, than it would to a volatile and split Palestinian movement. Of course, many Palestinians would regard it as a betrayal after decades struggling for independence. But, say the idea's backers, what is more important to Palestinians: a state, or an end to living under occupation?</p> <p>Not so fast, I say - and not only because Jordan's ruling Hashemites might not be too keen to expand the Palestinian majority in their country. I understand the despair of negotiators who have worked in vain for a decade and a half, but I am not ready to give the last rites to the two-state solution just yet. For one thing - as the peacemakers themselves still believe - it remains the most just resolution possible. Both sides would get the self-determination they want, the statehood other nations take for granted. More important, it is, despite everything, still achievable. </p> <p>Maybe not now, in today's environment. But no context remains static. If Israel's negotiations with Syria were to bear fruit, offering the prospect of a comprehensive settlement between Israel and its neighbours, the cost of the two-state solution might start to look more affordable to the Israeli public. If Hamas were to be ushered in from the cold, joining Fatah, the Palestinian calculus would change too. If there were serious economic incentives, perhaps funded by the Gulf states keen to score diplomatic points in their competition with Iran, that might change it again. </p> <p>But none of this can wait. It has to be done now. Just because the conflict has gone quiet, with no daily bombs on the evening news, it does not mean it cannot explode into violence once more. And the impact of that rarely stays confined to the region. </p> <p>What's needed, and with desperate urgency, is pressure from the outside. Not a last-minute effort, such as the one mounted by Bush last November, but a serious, engaged grip from - who else? - a new administration in Washington. That some of the most dedicated and ingenious peacemakers have now given up on the two-state option is surely warning enough. We have one last chance to make it work - before it truly is too late. <br><a href=\"mailto:freedland@theguardian.com\"><br>freedland@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The City's financial watchdog tonight sought to shore up confidence in Britain's biggest mortgage lender, HBOS, after a 40% fall in the bank's share price following two days of market turbulence caused by the collapse of Lehman Brothers.</p> <p>After a second day of sharp share falls in HBOS, the government was ready to activate long-standing contingency plans to ensure financial stability.</p> <p>The Financial Services Authority, in a rare public comment on a specific bank, said: \"We can confirm that, as HBOS already stated, HBOS has a strong capital base and continues to fund satisfactorily.\"</p> <p>The FSA, the Bank of England and the Treasury, spent today monitoring the health of Britain's banks after another nervous day in which central banks pumped more than $200bn into global markets but failed either to stem the selling pressure or to ease the logjam in money markets. London's FTSE 100 Index closed at its lowest in three days amid forecasts that the credit crunch could see more than 100,000 jobs shed by the UK's financial sector over the next year.</p> <p>Government sources said they had learned lessons from the collapse of Northern Rock a year ago, adding that they had thought about what they might do if a similar situation ever arose again.</p> <p>The authorities were, however, keen to play down any talk of a crisis and Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England, dropped no hint that he supported an early cut in borrowing costs to support UK banks when he wrote to Alistair Darling to explain a fresh rise in the annual inflation rate to 4.7% - more than double the chancellor's 2% target. With oil almost $60 a barrel down on its peak of $147 a barrel in August, King said he expected inflation to peak at around 5% but to remain above target well into next year.</p> <p>Borrowing costs in the City's money markets soared today amid evidence that jittery institutions were only prepared to lend to other firms for short periods and at high rates.</p> <p>In another dramatic development tonight, Barclays appeared to have secured a deal to buy a large part of Lehman Brothers, the fourth biggest investment bank on Wall Street that sparked turmoil in the markets when it filed for bankruptcy yesterday.</p> <p>Barclays president Bob Diamond was reported to have addressed Lehman staff on the trading floor in New York, telling them \"you have a new partner\".</p> <p>The fall in the HBOS share price forced the bank to issue a statement insisting it had a \"strong capital base\" which helped stem some of the slide. But the shares still ended 22% lower on the day at 182p after Standard &amp; Poor's, the rating agency, downgraded a crucial rating.</p> <p>The plunge in HBOS, which with two million shareholders has more investors than any other company and accounts for one pound in every five saved in the UK, caused Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman Vince Cable to call on the Financial Services Authority to intervene to stop the \"short selling\" of bank shares by hedge funds. Darling said today that the government was concerned about the short selling of sound financial institutions and the Treasury said tonight that the chancellor was consulting on ways to toughen up the FSA's policing of the practice.</p> <p>In the US tonight, America's central bank, the Federal Reserve, left interest rates on hold at 2%, prompting boos on the floor of the New York stock exchange. Dealers had been hoping for a cut in borrowing costs in the hope that it would halt the slide on global markets since the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the takeover of Merrill Lynch at the weekend. However the Dow Jones industrial average was later up more than 100 points.</p> <p>Attention on Wall Street was focused on the insurer, AIG, which will be forced to raise $14bn in collateral after being downgraded by all three of America's ratings agencies. The insurer's share price fell by more than 30% in early New York trading today amid fears that it would be the latest casualty of the credit crunch.</p> <p>Emergency talks were under way at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve as Treasury officials searched for financial institutions wiling to lend as much as $75bn to keep AIG afloat. </p> <p>The founder of the company and former chief executive Hank Greenberg warned that it would be a \"dramatic mistake\" to allow the business to go under.</p> <p>The Fed said in a statement: \"Strains in financial markets have increased significantly and labor markets have weakened further.\" It added, however, that it was as concerned about inflation as it was about growth.</p> <p>Asian and European stock markets fell heavily after today's 500-point drop in New York's Dow Jones industrial average. Tokyo's Nikkei index was down 5%, while London's FTSE 100 slipped 178.6 points to a three-year-low of 5025.6, having at one stage dipped through the 5000 barrier.</p> <p>Angel Gurria, secretary-general of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, said the West's leading economic think tank said the turmoil in the markets had put back recovery by a year. \"It has turned into a much bigger, more widespread and more threatening situation,\" Gurria said in an interview with the Guardian.</p> <p>\"Recovery was going to be the end of 2008 but that has now gone\", Gurria added. \"It will now be a year from now. All banks will by then know whether they have made it or not. There will be a few more casualties, perhaps, some in intensive care and some in the recovery ward.\"</p> <p>The consultancy firm Hay Group tonight warned that 110,000 jobs could go in the financial sector over the next year as a result of the credit crunch. Graeme Yell, head of financial services consulting at Hay Group, comments: \"That the financial services sector is suffering is no secret. But our findings reveal not just the extent of the damage, but the degree to which the industry has got downturn wrong.\"</p>",
  "<p>Despite his nightmares that nobody would bid for a single shark, unicorn or flying pig, Damien Hirst's trailblazing two-day auction at Sotheby's has made a total of \u00a3111m.</p> <p>This is a record for a one-artist auction, and ten times the previous record total, which was set by an auction of Picasso's work in 1993.</p> <p>This morning's session, at which all 80 lots were sold, made \u00a324.3m, adding to Monday night's \u00a370m.</p> <p>Sotheby's refused to reveal their exact deal with the artist, but he will have done dramatically better than if he had sold through his regular galleries, which take commissions of up to 50%.</p> <p>Lucian Freud's monumental 1995 portrait Big Sue - Benefits Supervisor Sleeping, was sold for \u00a317.2m by Christie's in New York earlier this year and still holds the auction record for a single work for a living artist. </p> <p>In the last decade, prices for contemporary art, boosted by city bonuses and new Russian and Middle Eastern buyers, have outstripped those for Old Masters, but those contemporary works were all sold by collectors, artists' estates, or galleries. </p> <p>Hirst, now a global brand, was the first to take a vast purpose-made collection of his own works direct to auction. </p> <p>Prices were erratic. Although all but five of the 223 lots were eventually sold, some went for well below their estimated totals. The Incredible Journey, his first zebra in a tank, went for \u00a31.1m, just under half the lowest estimate. </p> <p>There was much more enthusiasm for the archetypal Hirsts - the spots, spins and butterflies - which the artist hinted he is now tiring of. </p> <p>Bidding was noticeably brisker under the \u00a3500,000 mark. Over that price, only the anonymous phone bidders were left in the game.</p> <p>The Hirst that went for the highest price, the Golden Calf, fell short of the highest \u00a313m estimates, going under the hammer for \u00a310.3m last night. </p> <p>This was an auction record for the artist, but it almost seemed disappointing given the predictions that he might beat the US pop artist Jeff Koons, whose Balloon Flower sold in June for \u00a312.9m, to second place in the ranks of prices paid for a single work by a living artist.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Hirst is unlikely to feel disappointed - he has made more money in two days than all the artists in the National Gallery earned in a lifetime.</p>",
  "<p>Vinyl is back. We've <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jul/16/musicnews.music\">heard about it</a> for the last couple years, and the <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122126199207430275.html?mod=hpp_us_inside_today\">Wall Street Journal</a> is now the latest to run with the news that vinyl record sales doubled in 2007, flying in the face of the CD market's global decline. Labels are scrambling to release their new albums on vinyl, and Amazon.com's vinyl store now stocks 250,000 titles. This is more than just a passing fad. Vinyl's resurgence signals a sea change in the way music is being marketed and objectified.</p> <p>Smaller, more agile record labels have lower overhead and sales, but also much more to lose, comparatively, from CD sales drying up. Influential indie labels like Sub Pop and Matador have helped spawn the vinyl trend by packaging MP3 download codes with vinyl LPs, thus allowing digital portability while still providing physical copies of their records in a more durable format than the CD. Labels like these also deal in intentional scarcity and elaborate packaging, helping to blur the line between LP and limited-edition art object.</p> <p>There's money to be made in catering to a group of consumers that wants unique, non-disposable objects with collectible value and cachet, and it isn't limited to records. The American Poster Institute's <a href=\"http://www.americanposterinstitute.com/flatstock/\">Flatstock convention</a> is now a global institution, with hundreds of artists selling expensive silk-screened concert posters, their customers fuelled by the same impulse that compels them to seek out hard-to-find vinyl.</p> <p>Increasingly, larger labels sign artists to so-called <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/11/arts/music/11leed.html\">\"360 deals\"</a>, by which they get a cut of merchandise sales and concert revenue as well. Majors seem to be jumping on the vinyl bandwagon not just for its own sake, but to help spur sales of posters and T-shirts and the rest of the promotional tchotchkes that get packaged into deluxe vinyl box sets. Their bands are becoming brands.</p> <p>And while vinyl will never replace CDs, ringtones and downloads in terms of pure margin and profitability, it turns disposable major-label music into something tangible, scarce and collectible. It creates revenue streams that didn't exist five years ago. Even bands without 360 deals are being marketed aggressively. Warner Bros Records released Metallica's new album Death Magnetic in a half-dozen formats, including a five-LP version and a box set packaged in a <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2008/07/10/metallica-reveal-death-magnetic-coffin-box-details/\">miniature cardboard coffin</a>.</p> <p>While people have bemoaned the price of CDs for years, vinyl buyers rarely complain about how much records cost, even though they're usually more expensive. The people purchasing the $125 Metallica box set are happy to do it. There's something much more experiential and tactile about vinyl, with its extra weight, bigger format and larger art.</p> <p>And the good PR of throwing digital downloads in there is a huge added bonus as far as Warner Bros and its ilk are concerned. The Recording Industry Association of America may still be strong-arming grandmas and suing college kids, but it's in its member labels' best interest to be perceived as putting their consumers first. Releasing a record in multiple formats and deluxe versions makes major labels look less like the bad guys and more like proactive entities that listen to their fans, even though their bottom line is the same: make money by any means necessary.</p>",

Speaking on BBC radio this morning, Alistair Darling said that global cooperation is needed to fight the crisis.</p> <p>\"We need to take action internationally, and yesterday you saw right across the world the American Fed, the ECB, our own Bank of England and Japan all intervening,\" he explained, citing the various <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/15/marketturmoil.stockmarkets\">injections of liquidity announced yesterday by the world's central banks</a>.</p> <p>Darling also met with Bank of England governor Mervyn King today, sparking a City rumour that the pair had met for \"crisis talks\".

  "<p>Ministerial rebel David Cairns is \"absolutely wrong\" for attacking Gordon Brown's leadership, the Scottish Labour party's new leader said today.</p> <p>Iain Gray, a former aide to the chancellor, Alistair Darling, said the group of dissident Labour MPs who have openly plotted against the prime minister had a \"proposition which makes no sense to me\", given the economic crisis facing the UK.</p> <p>Cairns's resignation today completely overshadowed Gray's relaunch of the Scottish Labour group in the devolved parliament at Holyrood, three days after he was elected party leader in the Scottish parliament. </p> <p>He added: \"David Cairns is somebody I know and respect, and he's absolutely wrong. I have always made clear my loyalty for Gordon Brown, the prime minister.\" </p> <p>Brown, he said, was one of the \"towering political figures of my generation. He has an established track record. He created 10 years of economic growth and prosperity which allows our economy to be reasonably well-placed to survive the global economic turmoil we face now.\"</p> <p>Although Brown was careful to avoid directly influencing the leadership election, it was widely known that Gray was his favoured candidate. Gray succeeded in getting the largest number of nominations from Scottish MPs. </p> <p>Cairns, however, is understood to have supported the leftwing candidate for leader, Cathy Jamieson \u2013 a stance based largely on his experience working with her while she was justice minister in Holyrood.</p> <p>Confirmation that Cairns had stood down as the Scotland Office minister of state came only 15 minutes before Gray unveiled his new frontbench team at Holyrood, to the glee of SNP MSPs and other opposition parties.</p> <p>Gray has given senior frontbench roles to both his defeated leadership rivals. Andy Kerr, who came third in the leadership vote on Saturday, is again finance spokesman, while Jamieson, who came second and was deputy leader at Holyrood, has been given health.</p> <p>His deputy leader will be Johann Lamont, who beat the Campaign for Socialism candidate Bill Butler to the post in Saturday's party election and is a former deputy Scottish executive minister for communities and for justice.</p> <p>Margaret Curran, Labour's losing candidate in the Glasgow East byelection for Westminster in July, was given the task of policy development in the run-up to the 2011 Scottish parliament election.</p> <p>One of the most intriguing promotions was given to John Parks, the list MSP for Mid-Scotland and Fife, who only arrived at Holyrood in last May's Scottish elections. He has been given a special shadow cabinet post as shadow minister for employment and skills. </p> <p>A former electrical fitter apprentice and union leader at Rosyth dockyard in Fife, he is seen as a rising star in the Scottish Labour grouping, close to Gordon Brown, who is expected to play a key role in the Glenrothes byelection.</p> <p>Many observers now expect Labour to move the writ for Glenrothes in October, and hold the byelection on November 6 \u2013 two days after the US presidential election.</p> <p>Brian Adam, the SNP's chief whip in Holyrood, said: \"While Iain Gray shuffles the deckchairs in Scotland the New Labour ship is sinking and his new team have a long way to go to reach safety.</p> <p>\"With Andy Kerr, Cathy Jamieson, Margaret Curran, Rhona Brankin and Sarah Boyack still in Labour's team, there is little sign of new blood, new policy or new ideas in the Labour party.\" </p> <h2>Scottish Labour group shadow cabinet announced today</h2> <p><strong>Leader:</strong> Iain Gray </p> <p><strong>Deputy leader and chief of staff with special responsibility for equalities: </strong> Johann Lamont </p> <p><strong>Parliamentary business manager: </strong>Michael McMahon </p> <p><strong>Chief whip:</strong> David Stewart </p> <p><strong>Shadow minister for economy and skills: </strong>John Park </p> <p><strong>Shadow cabinet secretary for Europe, external affairs and culture: </strong>Pauline McNeill </p> <p><strong>Shadow cabinet secretary for finance and sustainable growth: </strong>Andy Kerr </p> <p><strong>Shadow cabinet secretary for education and lifelong learning: </strong>Rhona Brankin </p> <p><strong>Shadow cabinet secretary for health and wellbeing: </strong>Cathy Jamieson </p> <p><strong>Shadow cabinet secretary for justice: </strong>Richard Baker</p> <p><strong>Shadow Cabinet Secretary for rural affairs and environment: </strong>Sarah Boyack </p> <p><strong>Shadow cabinet secretary without portfolio with special responsibility for policy development: </strong>Margaret Curran</p>",
  "<p>Banking group HBOS endured another torrid day on the stock market today, losing 40% of its market value by mid-afternoon and facing renewed questions about its ability to keep funding its operations in paralysed financial markets.</p> <p>Despite repeated assurances from the country's biggest mortgage lender that it was robust enough to withstand the market turmoil, investors remained concerned about its business model. Its shares lost 17% on Monday following the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers.</p> <p>The extraordinary fall in the HBOS share price forced the bank to issue a statement insisting it had a \"strong capital base\" which helped stem some of the slide. But the shares still ended 22% lower at 182p after Standard &amp; Poor's, the rating agency, downgraded a crucial rating from A+ from AA-.</p> <p>The plunge in HBOS, which with 2 million shareholders has more investors than any other company, caused Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman Vince Cable to call on the Financial Services Authority to intervene to stop the \"short selling\" of bank shares by hedge funds. He said: \"Speculation is a normal part of trading in shares, but on this occasion the hedge funds are betting against the taxpayer, since they know that if a leading British bank were to collapse, the government would have no alternative but to intervene\".</p> <p>The FSA, while declining to comment on HBOS specifically, said it was \"closely monitoring the markets especially during such market volatility\".</p> <p>The rating agency said it was downgrading HBOS because it believed it was \"less well-positioned to manage the deteriorating operating environment\" than its peers, citing its exposure to the mortgage market which accounts for more than a half of its total loans.</p> <p>At the heart of the concerns among investors is HBOS's reliance on the money markets to raise funds to finance its business whic,h as well as lending money for homes, is a lender to big businesses and private equity deals.</p> <p>The bank pointed out that it has a large pool of deposits - \u00a3280bn - from savers and holds one in every five pounds saved in Britain to make it the biggest deposit taker in the UK. The majority of its funding - 52% - comes from these deposits.</p> <p>Lloyds TSB, which has a top-notch AAA rating and at one point yesterday was the biggest riser in the FTSE 100, achieves 61% of its funding from its deposits.</p> <p>Analysts at Exane BNP Paribas said HBOS was more reliant on wholesale funding than its peers but stressed that it was not alone in requiring such wholesale funding. \"We believe the market has assigned an unduly pessimistic assessment of HBOS's funding position and therefore, as the position is clarified ... the HBOS share price should recover,\" said James Eden, banks analyst at Exane BNP Paribas.</p> <p>But in addition to funding issues and its exposure to the mortgage market, there are questions about HBOS's strategy towards corporate customers - a business it has expanded rapidly since the merger between Halifax and Bank of Scotland created the bank seven years ago.</p> <p>That deal allowed the vast deposits accumulated by Halifax to help fuel Bank of Scotland's corporate banking operations. It also united a vast number of brands, including fund manager Insight Investment and the insurance group Clerical Medical. The bank also has operations in Ireland and Australia where it owns Bank West.</p> <p>As a result of its conversion from a building society, HBOS has more private shareholders than any other stock market listed company.</p>",
  "<p>The man who built AIG into a global insurance empire has appealed to the US government to save the company, describing it as a \"national treasure\" which merely needs a temporary helping hand to survive.</p> <p>Hank Greenberg, who was chief executive of AIG from 1967 until 2005, warned of reverberations around the world if the insurance company fails to pull off a last-minute deal to avert bankruptcy. He spoke out as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/16/insurance.morganstanley\">Federal Reserve continues efforts</a> to broker a bail-out for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/sep/15/aim.insurance.manchesterunited\">troubled firm</a>. \"Given some time, they could raise more funds and sell assets,\" Greenberg told CNBC television. \"That would be in our national interests, let alone the interests of the 100,000 people who work at AIG.\"</p> <p>The 83-year-old insurance tycoon, who quit in an accounting scandal three years ago, insisted that AIG is fundamentally sound but has a temporary cashflow crisis. \"It's a healthy company financially except for liquidity,\" said Greenberg. \"No organisation around the world has the spread of risk that AIG does. It's a company that opens markets - letting it go down would be a dramatic mistake.\"</p> <p>AIG's credit rating was downgraded by Standard &amp; Poor's, Moody's and Fitch late on Monday which has triggered contractual obligations requiring it to come up with some $14.5bn in extra collateral to satisfy trading partners. </p> <p>Analysts believe the company needs $40bn to survive. New York state's insurance regulator has allowed AIG to \"borrow\" $20bn from the statutory reserves of its insurance subsidiaries and the Fed has been trying to persuade banks, including Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, to provide an additional bridging loan.</p> <p>Although AIG's brand is not a household name in Britain, the company is a leader in providing \"white labelled\" insurance sold under UK brands such as Argos, Comet, Sainsbury's and the AA. It is the shirt sponsor of Manchester United football club.</p> <p>Greenberg, who lost much of his own personal fortune as AIG's shares have collapsed by 95%, said the Fed should use public money if no other option is open: \"If you can't raise it any other way in the private sector, the Fed should make a loan. It's not a gift, it's not a bail-out, because it's a solvent company.\"</p> <p>Intensive negotiations continued in New York today. The world's richest man, Warren Buffett, has rebuffed calls for his insurance empire, Berkshire Hathaway, to step in with help.</p> <p>The governor of New York state, David Paterson, said a collapse of AIG would hurt businesses in every corner of the globe. \"This is a catastrophic problem waiting if we are unable to curtail it,\" he said. \"We're in a terrible situation if we let the world's largest industrial and commercial insurer go down.\"</p> <p>Experts believe AIG has barely 24 hours to come up with funds to avoid following Lehman Brothers into oblivion. Standard &amp; Poor's downgraded the insurer's long-term credit rating from \"A minus\" to \"AA minus\" - a highly significant move which affects the credibility of its policies.</p> <p>\"The main reason for the rating actions is the combination of reduced flexibility in meeting additional collateral needs and concerns over increasing residential mortgage-related losses,\" said an S&amp;P analyst, Rodney Clark.</p> <p>The US treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, is reluctant to use public money to bail out another company following a controversial decision in March to stand behind some of Bear Stearns' riskier investments.</p> <p>Paulson argues that federal bailouts amount to a \"moral hazard\" in undermining the fairness of free-market investing. \"We don't take lightly ever putting the taxpayer on the line to support a financial institution,\" Paulson told a press conference on Monday. \"Moral hazard is something I don't take lightly.\"</p>",
  "<p>Poor Al Gore <a href=\"http://archive.salon.com/tech/col/rose/2000/10/05/gore_internet/\">truly stepped in it</a> eight years ago when he described his involvement in government internet incentives as taking \"the initiative in creating\" the Web. Republicans gleefully inflated and mocked his apparent egocentrism, and Gore barely recovered before the election.</p> <p>Now John McCain's chief economic adviser may just have done the same thing.<br><br>McCain claimed on TV this morning that his chairmanship of the Senate commerce committee during the 1990s helped educate him on the financial markets - an assertion that prompted reporters to ask economic adviser Doug Holtz-Eakin for some examples.</p> <p>Holtz-Eakin responded, incredibly, by <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/jonathanmartin/0908/HoltzEakin_McCain_helped_create_BlackBerry.html?showall\">holding up a BlackBerry</a>. \"He did this,\" the McCain adviser said.</p> <blockquote> <p>Telecommunications of the United States is a premier innovation in the past 15 years, comes right through the Commerce committee so you're looking at the miracle John McCain helped create and that's what he did.</p> </blockquote> <p>According to that logic, McCain must have been at least partially responsible for other technological innovations that emerged while he sat on the Commerce committee. Senator, thanks for the iPod and \"<a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/2008/06/09/mccain-its-a-google/\">a Google</a>\"!</p> <p>(But wait: This also means Obama was responsible for the lack of homeland-security breaches in the US since 2004, right? Because he's been on the Senate homeland security committee...)</p> <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Thanks to commenter USA4Obama for pointing out <a href=\"http://www.sciencedebate2008.com/www/index.php?id=42\">McCain's responses</a> to the policy site sciencedebate2008.com, in which he claims to -- wait for it -- have helped create wi-fi. Seriously.</p> <blockquote> <p>Under my guiding hand, Congress developed a wireless spectrum policy that spurred the rapid rise of mobile phones and Wi-Fi technology that enables Americans to surf the web while sitting at a coffee shop, airport lounge, or public park.</p> </blockquote> <p>Now, McCain has a point: he is a chief sponsor of <a href=\"http://www.wi-fiplanet.com/news/article.php/3515206\">a congressional plan</a> to encourage rural communities to develop faster broadband networks. </p> <p>But does he really want to remind folks of <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/news/special_reports/mojo_400/communications.html\">Global Crossing</a>, the telecom company that <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2002/01/28/companies/globalcrossing/\">went bankrupt</a> on dreams of expanding the wireless spectrum? </p> <p>McCain chaired the commerce committee during Global Crossing's heyday, before it had to work out a controversial government settlement to unload its wireless rights, and the senator was <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/02_06/c3769068.htm\">among the bigger recipients</a> of the company's political donations. That in itself wouldn't be notable - except, as the Wall Street Journal (link only available with Factiva or Nexis service) reported in 2002, McCain got $30,000 from Global Crossing executives in a single day after sending regulators a favourable letter about the company.</p> <p>I guess you could call that a \"guiding hand\"...</p>",

He should know. One of the world's wealthiest financiers and philanthropists, he made a fortune betting against the pound on Black Wednesday in 1992 \u2013 the day Britain crashed out of the European Exchange Rate mechanism. </p> <p>\"It's an historic situation right now. We are in a serious financial crisis: the worst of my lifetime. Most people don't realise that,\" he said on Friday, two days before the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers. \"The fact that the financial situation is serious is now a fait accompli.\"</p> <p>Soros was talking at the behest of a man also keen on ruminating on the state of the world: Alain de Botton. The philosopher, invited to take part in the latest instalment in the <a href=\"http://www.artangel.org.uk/pages/present/present_conversation.htm\">Artangel Longplayer Conversation series</a>, said he wanted to speak to \"a man of the world\" and so chose to sit down with Soros at the Royal Geographical Society in London. </p> <p>The series was launched in 2005, inspired by a philosophical premise: Jem Finer's Longplayer, a musical composition made from looped and stretched recordings of Tibetan prayer bowls, which is playing out, in real time, over the entire 1,000 years of this millennium. </p> <p>It involves two cultural thinkers, aware of each other's work but never having met, engaging in conversation in front of a crowd of interested spectators. Last year, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/artblog/2007/mar/05/brucemaumeetsdavidadjaye\">British architect David Adjaye opined with Canadian designer Bruce Mau</a> on the challenges faced by designers and architects in the 21st century. Previously, New York artist and musician Laurie Anderson traded thoughts on the art and science of keeping time with Nobel prize-winning writer Doris Lessing. </p> <p>This year, it was less of a conversation than a quasi-intellectual Q&amp;A, with De Botton doing most of the questioning and Soros attempting to answer him with varying degrees of wit and wisdom.</p> <p>Soros was most interesting, of course, on the economy \u2013 and you got the sense that that was what the majority of the audience was there for. It wasn't always comfortable listening \u2013 a lot of doom and gloom, and even, at one point, talk of \"the end of this particular civilisation in which we are living\". </p> <p>But Soros stopped short of predicting Armageddon. \"I don't think it's the end of the world,\" he said. \"We always go to the brink and when we get there we realise we don't want to go there and we pull together and pull back.\"</p> <p>You could almost feel the bankers and hedge fund managers in the audience sigh with relief.</p> <p>It was politics, not economics, however, that attracted De Botton to the financier in the first place \u2013 particularly Soros's idea of an \"open society\", which is developed from the thoughts of philosopher Karl Popper. Soros, who was born in Hungary in 1930, traced his own childhood experience under both communism and fascism, through to the current \"imperfect society\" under democracy in the US. </p> <p>Soros previously put millions of dollars into the Democrats' campaign to oust George Bush from the White House in 2004. In this talk, he said that the US president has manipulated society, so that the \"purpose of politics becomes not the truth but to get elected\". But \"at least you can get rid of Bush,\" he said, with hope \u2013 and this was why he remained committed to the idea of democracy, though flawed, as still preferable to the alternatives. </p> <p>The flaws of democracy discussed here included the use of political advertising, the electorate's lack of concern with the truth and Rupert Murdoch's disproportionate grip on the US media. Things took a somewhat sticky turn when Soros admitted he had invested shares in Murdoch's News International and yet did not think this amounted to an endorsement. Indeed, Soros believed there was nothing wrong with investing in companies whose ideas you disagreed with.</p> <p>Such apparent inconsistencies in Soros's thinking peppered the talk, and it was a shame that De Botton did not pin him down more. The tone throughout was convivial \u2013 determinedly so. This conversation was in no danger of turning into a heated debate.</p> <p>In tangential twists and turns, however, the talk did take in a wide and impressive range of subjects: what De Botton termed \"philosophical themes of investment\" (\"How exactly do you make money, Mr Soros, and should I invest in uranium?\"); the art of reading reality when looking at financial markets; Barack Obama and the politics of left and right; philanthropy; the role of education in making the electorate more truth-seeking; the environment as an existential issue; and China. </p> <p>Overall, the talk was at its best when De Botton jousted with his interlocutor with a bit more force. At one point, Soros said: \"Money gives you power and that gives you freedom \u2013 and that's what I enjoy.\"</p> <p>De Botton replied with a wicked grin, \"We are lucky that you are not an evil person.\" Indeed we are.</p>",
  "<p>US inflation fell for the first time in two years last month thanks to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/16/oil.commodities\">falling oil prices</a>, something which analysts said could enable the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates this evening in response to the global market turmoil.</p> <p>US consumer prices dropped 0.1% in August from July, pulling the annual inflation rate down to 5.4% from 5.6% the month before.</p> <p>The Fed is thought likely to respond to the stress in money markets today in the wake of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/16/marketturmoil.lehmanbrothers\">the collapse of Lehman Brothers bank</a> by cutting its key interest rate by a quarter-point to just 1.75%.</p> <p>\"If the Fed is thinking of cutting interest rates this afternoon, this gives them a little more freedom to do that,\" said Robert McIntosh, chief economist for Eaton Vance Corp in Boston.</p> <p>Energy costs tumbled 3.1% in August, the biggest drop since October 2006, after rising 4% in July. Transportation costs declined 1.5% after a 1.7% rise in July as gasoline prices dropped by 4.2%. </p> <p>And fuel costs are likely to fall again this month after US light crude futures dropped below $91 a barrel today - down 37% from their peak of above $147 three months ago. </p> <p>Paul Ashworth, an economist at Capital Economics, said tumbling petrol prices would pull <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">US inflation</a> below 4% in the near future.</p> <p>\"Overall, the inflation outlook is a lot better than many commentators seem to think. Admittedly, it's a little too early for the Fed to sound the all-clear just yet - we expect it will leave rates on hold today - but inflation should not be an obstacle to lowering rates for much longer.\"</p> <p>Housing costs were down 0.1% last month, the first decline since early 2003, after climbing 0.6%.</p> <p>The favourable news on consumer prices was issued just as policy-setting members of the Federal Open Market committee gathered to consider interest-rate strategy amid a crisis in credit markets that has rattled investors around the world.

  "<p>The investment bank <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/goldmansachs\">Goldman Sachs</a> suffered a 70% slump in quarterly profits to $845m (\u00a3475m) as it caught a chill from the ill wind blown by the global <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">credit crunch</a>.</p> <p>Goldman's drop in third-quarter earnings sent its shares down more than 10% to $1.21 in the opening minutes of trading on the New York Stock Exchange in a jittery market as investors fear broader instability in the banking industry in the wake of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/lehmanbrothers\">Lehman Brothers collapse</a>.</p> <p>In a statement, Goldman's chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, described the outcome as a \"solid performance in a tough environment\".</p> <p>He said: \"This was a challenging quarter as we saw a marked decrease in client activity and declining asset valuations.\"</p> <p>Until recently, Goldman was viewed as one of Wall Street's few winners from the global credit crunch. It made record profits last year when its traders correctly forecast a slump in the sub-prime mortgage industry.</p> <p>But a collapse in the credit market and an evaporation in deal-making activity has taken its toll. </p> <p>Goldman's investment banking division saw a 40% fall in revenue to $1.29bn, including a 56% plunge in financial advisory fees, blamed on an industry-wide decrease in mergers and acquisitions. </p> <p>In its trading and principal investments division, the bank's revenue dived by 67% to $2.7bn. Goldman revealed that it made a $500m loss on residential mortgage-related securities and a $325m loss on commercial mortgages. Its principal investments operation made a $453m loss, largely due to corporate and property investments.</p> <p>Blankfein remained upbeat, saying: \"We remain well-positioned to meet the needs of our clients and identify and act on the right market opportunities.\"</p> <p>Goldman watched the demise of several of its biggest competitors this year. Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers have collapsed, while Merrill Lynch surrendered its independence this week through a $50bn takeover by Bank of America.</p> <p>Analysts are keen to disentangle the level of exposure held by Goldman to its troubled rivals through interconnected investments and credit swaps. </p> <p>Prior to the release of Goldman's earnings, equity analysts at Standard &amp; Poor's cut their rating on the bank's shares from buy to hold. In a research note, S&amp;P said it still believed Goldman had performed \"better than its peers\" through sound risk management and prudent executive decisions.

  "<p>The <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/politics/liberaldemocrats\">Liberal Democrats</a>' commitment to introducing pay-as-you-drive schemes on Britain's major roads could be seen as a \"poll tax on wheels\", a frontbench spokesman warned today. </p> <p>Environment spokesman Martin Horwood said the party's opponents would be able to level \"unfair accusations\" that Lib Dems were trying to introduce \"roads for the rich\". </p> <p>The frontbencher and MP for Cheltenham was speaking during a debate on the party's transport policy at the <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/politics/libdemconference\">annual conference</a> in Bournemouth. </p> <p>Part of the wide-ranging set of proposals include a long-term commitment to introducing road pricing on motorways and trunk roads within 10 years.</p> <p>Admitting to fears that the policy could cost the party votes, Horwood said the measure risked creating ratruns on smaller roads as people looked to avoid the charges.</p> <p>The measure would also hit the poorest hardest and that most people would be unable to avoid it, he told delegates. </p> <p>\"With any flat-rate tax, absolutely inevitably it hits the poorest pockets hardest,\" he said. \"So does fuel duty, of course, but two wrongs don't make a right. </p> <p>\"Roads for the rich, poll tax on wheels - those would be unfair accusations but ones that would be easy for our opponents to make.\" <br> Horwood's bid to have the commitment removed from the policy was rejected by delegates, as was an attempt to make the party adopt re-nationalisation of the railways. </p> <p>The policy paper also contains plans to reduce fuel duty and scrap vehicle excise duty altogether. </p> <p>Under the plans, vehicle excise duty would first be \"steeply graduated\" for new cars to encourage environmental efficiencies and reduce carbon emissions.</p> <p>The duty would then be abolished altogether and fuel duty reduced in order to introduce the \"revenue neutral\" road pricing scheme. <br> Car showroom taxes on new, high emission cars would also be increased, while environmentally friendly models would see a tax reduction.</p> <p>Under the \"green switch\" proposal, any additional revenue raised would be used to reduce income tax.</p> <p>Transport spokesman Norman Baker said the road-pricing scheme was not unfair, as it would only be introduced where there were real public transport alternatives. </p> <p>And he spoke in passionate defence of his party's ideas for revolutionising transport, saying he wanted to create a \"rail renaissance\" alongside green policies that promote fairness. </p> <p>The policy paper adopted by the conference contains a pledge to establish a high-speed rail system in the UK as well as longer-term franchises for train operators and electrification of the railways by 2050.</p> <p>Baker said: \"The Lib Dems are the only party with the foresight and determination to produce a coherent, courageous and costed plan for transport that is fit for the 21st century. </p> <p>\"We are the only party to produce a forward plan to tackle congestion and pollution while being fair to the motorist. <br> Baker told delegates that someone travelling by car between London and Edinburgh had an obvious public transport alternative, whereas someone travelling between two villages in Derbyshire without the option of public transport should not be penalised.</p> <p>\"We are seeking to increase the cost of travelling where there is an alternative,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Where there is no public transport alternative, why should they be charged in the process?\" he asked. \"It is a green tax that works.\"</p> <p>Other plans include a \"future transport fund\", which would be used to invest in improvements in the public transport system, including a UK-wide high speed rail network and funding to meet the public transport priorities of the devolved administrations.</p> <p>The transport paper, overwhelmingly backed by the conference, also lays out plans to create a single department for the environment, energy and transport to improve policy coordination.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/politics/chrishuhne\">Chris Huhne</a> today gave a taste of the battle the Liberal Democrats will take to the Tories at the next general election, straying away from his portfolio to devote a third of his conference speech to attacking the <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives\">Conservative party</a> and barely mentioning the government.</p> <p>Speaking on the penultimate day of the <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/politics/libdemconference\">Lib Dem conference</a> in Bournemouth, the home affairs spokesman received a standing ovation for his speech \u2013 the first delivered to the party's annual gathering since he narrowly lost the leadership contest to <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/politics/libdemconference\">Nick Clegg</a> last year.</p> <p>He said: \"David Cameron, like Tony Blair, wants to be all things to all people. Tories would have us believe they are the party of the environment, and of owners of big cars; of traditional values, and of change; of equality, and of lower taxes on the best off; of liberty, and of removing checks on police surveillance; of European membership for Georgia, and of puling out of Europe's social chapter for us. If politics is about making tough choices, the Tory party is about ducking hard decisions.\"</p> <p>Party insiders said his well known political attack methods - most memorably, the \"Calamity Clegg\" document compiled by his team in the leadership contest \u2013 would be trained on the Tories in the run-up to a general election. Some 70% of Liberal Democrat MPs are thought to have Conservative candidates as their main constituency rivals.</p> <p>Deploying jibes about social class, Huhne said: \"We are now told that David Cameron and George Osborne were idealistic young people who cared about fairness. Perhaps they agonized over their options as they adjusted their fancy tailcoats \u2013 mirror, mirror on the wall, which party is the fairest of them all?</p> <p>\"Fairness will be a Tory value when hell freezes over, Notting Hill becomes a workers' republic, and the Bullingdon club affiliates to the Socialist International.\" </p> <p>A senior party strategist told the Guardian that this conference had been about showing the party had strength in depth, admitting that Clegg had not yet established himself. He said: \"Nick is growing in stature, but while he does that we are able to show that we have a strong shadow cabinet.\"</p> <p>In his speech, Huhne presented to conference the details of the crime policy document launched a fortnight ago. The party is calling for money currently spent on imprisoning criminals to be reallocated to policing.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrats are already committed to putting the money saved from scrapping the government's ID cards scheme into an extra 10,000 policemen but said they would go further, saying that if the prison population had been frozen at 1997 levels rather than expanded, the money saved would enable a government to put an extra 25,000 policemen on the streets.</p> <p>A National Crime Reduction Agency would also be established to assess police and criminal justice policies on evidence along the lines of the guidelines issued by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence to steer health policy.</p> <p>He accused the government of \"legislative diarrhoea\" and \"punishment posturing\" saying that Labour jailed too many people for minor offences. Huhne said the government had created 3,600 new offences since 1997.</p> <p>The Lib Dems would scrap central targets for police and allow forces to set their own targets locally. </p> <p>This measure was expected to run into trouble when the matter was put to the vote at conference on Sunday since elements of the party were concerned by the idea of locally elected police chiefs weakening the authority of the local council, but the measure was passed.</p>",

  "<p>When the first plane hit the World Trade Centre at lunchtime on September 11, 2001, the news caused nothing more than a brief stir in our trading room; when the second tower was struck, pandemonium ensued. While the rest of the world downed tools and gaped open-mouthed at the slaughter unfolding on their screens, traders in the world's bourses went into overdrive, frenziedly dealing on the back of the massive volatility that was sweeping global markets. </p> <p>Cynical as it may seem, some of my friends from my City days still recall 9/11 as one of the greatest sessions of their trading lives; the day that they cleaned up in spades on the back of the misery and massacre of thousands of others. Anyone who shorted the indices (ie, sold stocks they didn't own in the correct expectation that they could buy them back more cheaply later on) made an absolute killing, capitalising on the fear and panic that swept through the markets and sent share prices crashing through the floor. </p> <p>While there is a tendency among the self-righteous to criticise individual short-sellers who make money out of the misfortune of others, the fact is that those playing the stockmarket in such a fashion are merely a product of the system, rather than the catalyst behind the so-called evil. Once upon a time, stockmarkets were there to provide companies with a means to raise capital from investors; today's financial world is a vastly different beast.</p> <p>Nowadays, there is as much incentive to kick a company while it's down as there is to support it when it is in ruder health; short sellers hover around a dying stock like vultures anticipating a feast, and every financial institution is as guilty as the next when it comes to gorging on the remains. Lehman Brothers' demise is a case in point, as too is AIG's seemingly impending collapse. </p> <p>For every Sky News viewer watching in shock as <a href=\"http://www.skypressoffice.co.uk/SkyNews/AboutUs/biography.asp?id=107\">Eamonn Holmes</a> dumbs down <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/16/insurance.morganstanley\">AIG's plight</a> with incessant reminders that it sponsors Manchester United, there are dozens of traders sitting pretty from their successful bear raid on the company. AIG shares lost over 60% in value yesterday, meaning that there were undoubtedly some very rich people made even richer by virtue of their having seen that AIG's end was nigh. </p> <p>And so to Lehman Brothers, where thousands of employees were summarily dismissed over the weekend, prompting a wide range of responses from commentators on all sides of the political spectrum. Will Hutton's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/16/insurance.morganstanley\">impassioned call</a> for stringent government crackdowns on the way the markets operate highlighted the lack of sympathy he and many others have for those traders caught up in the Lehman meltdown. </p> <p>In a way, it can be argued, many Lehmans traders were the architects of their own downfall. By being such major players in the derivatives market which, ultimately, has proved responsible for the credit crisis, they were signing their own death warrants. Not that they would have known it at the time, but once the first domino started falling last summer, the writing was on the wall; banks and hedge funds have been dropping like flies ever since, with little sign of an end to the epidemic.</p> <p>On a parochial level, of course one should feel sorry for the individuals now out of a job, in the same way that sympathy should be extended to workers at XL, Alitalia, or at any of the other scores of companies falling victim to the credit crunch's malaise. However, as far as the bigger picture is concerned, when the hunter becomes the hunted \u2013 as with Lehmans, Bear Stearns, AIG, and so on \u2013 it is hard to elicit much compassion from those who have been on the receiving end of those companies' trading strategies in the past. </p> <p>By definition, for every loser in the stock market there must be a winner, and City society does not deem it incumbent on the winner to share the loser's pain. This is true outside market circles as well; when British tourists were cheering sterling's strength a year ago, were they sparing any thought for the citizens of the countries whose currencies had collapsed against the pound? It's unlikely and, given human nature, it is wholly understandable too. </p> <p>But if, as Hutton says, the name of the game should be about protecting companies, helping them develop and succeed, and avoiding financial calamities such as are unfolding today, then the markets need an injection of decency and morality as a matter of urgency. However, as anyone with any experience of the City knows, the chances of that happening are slimmer than AIG's hopes of survival. In the meantime, for every bull in its death throes, there is a bear laughing all the way to the bank.</p>",

  "<p>Teachers at Amorikot primary school were in for a surprise as the third term began yesterday.</p> <p>Usually teachers have to wait for pupils to trickle in at the start of term, but this time the youngsters, most dressed in their green uniforms, poured in early, with no teacher in sight.</p> <p>They opened their classrooms, got a feel of the white and blue painted brick walls, the new desks and cemented floor and pushed their heads out of the windows to call out to friends to share the delight.</p> <p>There was a party atmosphere at Amorikot.</p> <p>\"The new classrooms are better because when it rains, we shall not get wet,\" said Pius Otelu, six, as he walked towards the playground. His brother, Emmanuel Achibu, 13, was just as excited about the school. Their father, a soldier in the Uganda Peoples Defence Forces (UPDF), died in 2005 and the children had to swap the life of Kumi town with that of Amorikot village.</p> <p>Emmanuel believes with the new classrooms, will improve his studies and help him pursue his dream of becoming a doctor so he can \"get a lot of money\".</p> <p>Three months ago, Pius and the rest of the primary one class sat on the dusty ground inside a grass-thatched structure for their English lesson. Every structure - from the headteacher's office to the pit latrine - was built with mud and wattle and thatched with grass. In the biggest single achievement of the project so far in Katine, Amref has built seven permanent classrooms and school offices, and modern latrines, with an initial investment of 173m shillings (around $107,000).</p> <p>Although the school was <a href=\" http://www.guardian.co.uk/katine/2008/aug/12/education.projectgoals\">officially opened</a> six weeks ago, this was the first time pupils had used the classrooms, and they took to their new environment with zeal. Of the 391 pupils enrolled at the school, 277 reported on the opening day - a great start, said headteacher Ben Ejadu.</p> <p>\"This is a very great improvement; I have never seen such a big number [of pupils] on the opening day of the term,\" said Ejadu, seated on one of the new desks placed where once Pius and his friends sat on the earth. \"On day one of the term I would get 100 or even 50 pupils.\"</p> <p>And he is in no doubt what has caused this surge of interest in school.</p> <p>\"It is the new buildings; the children know they are coming to sit on desks and in a new place,\" said Ejadu, who arrived two hours after school was supposed to have begun, because of an appointment with the Soroti district education officer. When he did arrive he was unable to get into his new office as the keys had been \"misplaced\" by the school management committee chairman. That did not dampen the mood, however. A bell was rung and the school assembly convened. After a prayer and the national anthem, came the education chant:</p> <p>\"We young women and men of Uganda, are marching along the path of education... we are the pillars of tomorrow's Uganda, let's rise now to embrace true knowledge, yielding discipline, resourcefulness, uniting for a better Uganda.\"</p> <p>And then the children marched into their classrooms - primary one and two first. Pius was among the first, taking up a place on the first desk on the front row along with three other boys. Others squeezed up to six per desk, even if desks behind were empty. They smiled, laughed and chatted.</p> <p>For Ejadu and the four teachers on duty so far, the challenge was to get everyone seated somewhere. Primary five and seven classes have no furniture yet; Amref's contractor has yet to deliver the last consignment of nearly 40 desks. So primary five pupils carried desks from primary two, while primary seven and six shared a classroom, as the teachers got to work.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337664379\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2007/12/12/katine_140x84.jpg\" alt=\"Amorikot primary school\" width=\"140\" height=\"84\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amorikot primary school before the rebuild. Photograph: Dan Chung</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Chung/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These, however, are the smaller challenges. As a community, non-government school, Amorikot has only two qualified teachers - Ejadu and his deputy \u2013 and receives a flat grant of up to Shs 200,000 ($123) per term from the government. The headteacher hopes the government will now take more interest in Amorikot, help pay for qualified teachers and provide capitation grants - money from the government to cover the cost of tuition fees, brought in under Uganda's universal primary education policy.</p> <p>While government schools do not charge tuition, Amorikot parents have to pay about $6 per term, which is meant to cover teachers' pay. But the money often comes late. Teachers were not paid for the whole of the first term this year. It was only in July, as the school teetered on closure, that money was squeezed out of the parents. By then, one teacher was already resigned and another who had died late last year was not replaced.</p> <p>The Soroti district authorities have promised to support Amorikot, but the bureaucracy can take time.</p> <p>Education officer Michael Etoyu-Oumo says one qualified teacher has been transferred to Amorikot from Katine primary school, but is waiting final confirmation. Oumo says Amorikot, one of 27 community schools in Soroti, should become government-aided in the next year, if, as expected, the government lifts the cap on teacher recruitment. That will not solve all the school's problems, but it would be a remarkable milestone in one village's struggle to provide good education for its children.</p> <p>No wonder Simon Oguti, the chairman of Amorikot village council and a member of the Parent Teacher Association, believes the school is on the right path. \"I think we are going to have a school that will produce big people,\" said Oguti, a 28-year-old farmer, whose eldest daughter, Irene, should start school in two years. \"Teachers, doctors and engineers will come from this school.\"</p> <p>\u00b7 This article was amended on Thursday September 18 2008.

  "<p>Leading shares have fallen to news lows for the day, with the <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/ftse\">FTSE 100</a></strong> down 169.3 points at 5034.9 in volatile trading.</p> <p>Part of the reason is a sharp jump in overnight and three-month Libor rates - the rates at which banks lend to each other.

It has a further $150m revolver (of which no more than $30m may be used to fund the transaction). With our forecast of a net debt position of some $140m post the transaction, Misys needs these facilities.</p> <p>\"The major cash outgoing is the $330m dividend to be paid to Allscripts' shareholders five days after the deal closes (around 1 October). So we imagine Misys has some two weeks to find funding in a tricky (and possibly expensive) market. It is unclear whether the EGM [on 22 September to ratify the deal] can proceed if the facilities are no longer in place, but we would assume so.</p> <p>\"While this must be the worst two weeks of the crunch so far to go shopping for a $305m facility, we assume one is available at some price and as such we imagine the deal should still go through. Certainly Misys must be working overtime to ensure it does. Its own healthcare business was already in sharp decline. It has stopped investing in R&amp;D in its own business and we suspect business has continued to be poor.

  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> New York. <br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Ben (electronics), Lo (vocals), Prince Terrence (drums), Kate (visuals). <br> <strong>The background:</strong> If you like Crystal Castles but find their 8-bit punk-disco hard to swallow, then try Hearts Revolution, yet another duo \u2013 two really is the new black - who are offering a sort of accessible (these things being relative) version of that extreme electro-terrorist digital hardcore sound. In a parallel universe, their songs, a series of yelps over DIY shards of rhythm with chanted choruses and slim, size-zero melodies, would all be smash hits. Hearts Revolution, who have been touring as support to the New Band of the Day-sanctioned Midnight Juggernauts, call themselves thrash-metal electronicists and boy/grrrl revolutionaries, with echoes in the latter phrase of the likes of Huggy Bear from the early-90s riot grrrl era. In fact, they're like Huggy Bear plugged into the National Grid. They've even remixed the Bear's best-known song, Her Jazz, with its immortal kiss-off to the straight world, \"This is happening without your permission\". They've got songs that teeter on that fine line between brutal and beautiful, songs about laser beams and wolves and libertines, with titles like Ultraviolence and Switchblade, which sound like they've been lifted from one of Bobby Gillespie's doodle-pads. They've even got a genuinely pretty ballad called Digital Suicide with shades of Suicide's Dream Baby Dream that references something called \"sonic dreams\" and contains a deeply old-fashioned demand to \"stop the world, I want to get off\".<br> And yet they're so fashionable and of-the-moment that Hearts Revolution are currently making people in Hoxton weep tears of joy. They've got all the right global connections (New York, Tokyo, LA, Paris), if they were any better looking it would be illegal, oh, and they \"redrawing the lines between art and commerce\". Just like that. Roughly translated, this means they're handling the packaging and marketing, the visual aspect of what they do, all by themselves, under the rubric, Choose Your Own Adventure. Live, artist and fashion designer Kate Moross adds fluoro images and projections, but they don't play regular gigs, no sir, that would be so 20th century. No, instead they've got their own branded ice-cream truck, a pink machine called Hearts Challenger that is known to pull up at parties, art openings and music events, and from the back of which they spontaneously jam (a rockist term meaning \"plug in and play\"). They also sell sweets and Japanese toys from the van as a way of enhancing the idea of Hearts Revolution as a self-contained dream world. But they're not nihilists or angry angst-merchants. \"We do what we want, support who we love,\" they declare, quaintly. \"How? We are powered by love.\" Cute. </p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"They are dedicated to progressing the state of music and pushing change in all the right places.\" <br> <strong>The truth:</strong> They're a Crystal Castles you don't have to pretend to like.<br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Sell you some sherbet fountains.<br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Sell you the idea of rock'n'roll as a capitalist scheme to control the masses.<br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> Their debut single Ultraviolence is released on December 1 by Kitsune. <br> <strong>File next to:</strong> Crystal Castles, Atari Teenage Riot, the Boredoms, Shampoo. <br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/heartsrevolution\">www.myspace.com/heartsrevolution</a></p> <p><strong>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> Peter Conway. </p>",

  "<p>Jonathan Loynes at Capital Economics said: \"August's UK CPI figures suggest that the MPC's inflation worries are unlikely to evaporate completely for a little while yet. Not only was the headline rate (4.7%) above expectations yet again, but the core rate edged up again from 1.9% to 2.0%, equalling the highest rate for over 10 years. At this rate, core inflation is incompatible with the 2% inflation target, allowing for some positive contribution from food and energy.\"</p> <p>Howard Archer at Global Insight said: \"Consumer price inflation is set to go higher still over the next couple of months despite the recent substantial retreat in oil prices. Indeed, consumer price inflation seems likely to reach 5.0% as sharply rising utility bills, elevated food prices and a weaker pound impact.</p> <p>\"While the further marked rise in inflation in August dilutes hopes of an interest rate cut before the end of the year, much will depend on just how deep and extended the current financial market turmoil is, and what impact it has on the wider economy. The Bank of England sees tight credit conditions as a particularly serious risk to economic activity and it is highly possible that the credit crunch will intensify for an extended period following Lehman Brothers' collapse. Furthermore, it still seems probable that inflation will fall back markedly from late-2008 as weak economic activity should increasingly dilute underlying inflationary pressures.</p> <p>\"We expect inflation to be back to the target level of 2.0% by the end of 2009. This should allow the Bank of England to bring interest rates down to 3.50% in 2009, regardless of whether it starts cutting this year, or delays acting until early-2009.\"</p> <p>David Kern, economic adviser to the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \"Today's rise CPI inflation was larger than expected, but RPI inflation fell. And these new figures do not yet take account of the recent large falls in oil prices. </p> <p>\"It is clear that CPI inflation will reach its peak within the next two or three months. As the global financial crisis worsens, there is an urgent need to act promptly, in order to counter severe threats of recession. The MPC should urgently consider a rate cut to 4.75% in October.\"</p> <p>James Knightley at ING said: \"UK CPI for August has come in above expectations at 4.7% year-on-year (consensus was 4.6% and the previous reading was 4.4%). This is a new series high. The fact that the core rate rose to 2% shows that inflation is no longer just concentrated in food and energy, which will cause some concern at the BoE. Indeed, with household inflation expectations at an all time high the BoE is likely to remain concerned about the potential for second round price effects. </p> <p>\"This suggests to us that we will need to see a marked deterioration in financial market conditions to get a near-term rate cut. However, given that the Bank of England targets inflation on a 2-year horizon, which should see inflation sharply lower due to falling wholesale energy costs and the effects of recession, we still look for aggressive rate cuts. We look for the policy rate to fall to 3.50% within the next 12 months.\"<br></p>",
  "<p>Theatre takes place in small rooms and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/theatreblog/2008/sep/16/theatre\">affects limited numbers of people</a>. In an era of movie downloads, stadium gigs and global coverage of the Olympics, it's easy to imagine the business of putting on plays is a quaint relic of a bygone era with little to contribute to the culture as a whole. Yet, in practice, the reverse is true.<br> Those of us who see theatre professionally are keeping an eye on a barometer of the times, one that can tell us, with reasonable efficiency and some accuracy, about the temper and preoccupations of our era. But more than that, it is an instrument which, in certain conditions, can not only reflect cultural changes but actually bring them about. The latest example of this is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/aug/06/edinburghfestival.theatre2\">Deep Cut</a> which, during its award-winning run on the Edinburgh Fringe, can have been seen by no more than 2,500 people, a figure that would embarrass the most lowly of satellite TV broadcasters. Yet such are the shockwaves theatre sends out into the culture \u2013 through word of mouth, newspaper reviews and comment pieces such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/29/military.defence\">Mark Lawson's</a> \u2013 that it remains an art form of disproportionate influence.<br> \"Following the extraordinary (if somewhat unexpected) success of the play Deep Cut at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe,\" write Des and Doreen James, the parents of Private Cheryl James who died from gunshot wounds in 2005, \"the families of the young people who died at Deepcut have decided to mount, for the first time, a formal campaign for a public inquiry into the deaths.\" If, like Mark Lawson, you believe what the play has to say \"demands a response from the authorities\", you can <a href=\" http://petitions.number10.gov.uk/Deepcut-justice/\">sign an epetition</a> at the official website of the prime minister's office to help get the campaign rolling. When Fiona Evans' <a href=\" http://www.live.org.uk/whatsOn/ListingsDetail.php?perf=E482b107a4436b\">Geoff Dead: Disco for Sale</a>, inspired by the death of Private Geoff Gray at the barracks in 2001, opens at Newcastle's Live Theatre in October, it will demonstrate further the capacity of theatre to spur political change.<br> Some combination of theatre's freedom to respond quickly to events and its capacity to function as a live, public forum makes it ideally suited to influencing the wider world in this way. Sometimes this can be in the general articulation of an idea, as when the work of Dublin's Abbey Theatre contributed to the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/easterrising/prelude/pr02.shtml\">cultural movement towards nationalism</a> and the foundation of the Republic of Ireland. Other times, it can be a more specific change, such as Terence Rattigan's thinly disguised gay play, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2006/apr/04/theatre\">Table Number Seven</a>, written when homosexuality was illegal, which Michael Billington identifies in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2007/oct/24/theatre1\">State of the Nation</a> as a \"milestone\" in the \"shifting nature of public tolerance [that] shows the capacity of art to anticipate legal reform.\"<br> Most examples are of plays that make a general contribution to public opinion, but what examples are there of plays that had a direct impact on government policy, people's behaviour and other areas of civic life?</p>",
  "<p>According to the RAC the cost of motoring is actually going down. \"In real terms it is 18% cheaper to buy and run a car, including fuel costs, in 2008 than 1988,\" claimed a recent report from the motoring organisation.</p> <p>That may be so, but <a href=\"http://www.racnews.co.uk/index.asp?PageID=23&amp;subsection=reports&amp;submitted=1\">said same report</a> also admits some aspects of running a car are now much more expensive. Fuel, for example, has gone up by 200% in real terms over the past two decades.</p> <p>The cost of owning and running a car is on average \u00a35,627 a year, says the RAC. Half of that is depreciation, nearly \u00a31,200 is fuel, and the rest is tax, interest payments, insurance, maintenance, and breakdown membership. So what can you do to reduce these costs?</p> <h2>1. Drive like a saint</h2> <p>Smoother driving leads to a big saving in fuel, and a big cash saving too. Over 10,000 miles you might <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/sep/10/travelandtransport.carbonemissions\">save \u00a3500 by driving efficiently</a>, according to a recent test done by the Driving Standards Agency.</p> <p>If you pull away from traffic lights without revving, don't rev while idle, don't use fuel-hungry air-conditioning and don't sit there with the engine running you can <a href=\"http://www.theaa.com/motoring_advice/fuels-and-environment/drive-smart.html\">cut fuel use by between 10% and a third</a>, the AA claims.</p> <p>And slow down - according to the Department for Transport, driving at 70mph uses <a href=\"http://www.dft.gov.uk/ActOnCO2/?q=tips_and_advice\">up to 9% more fuel than driving at 60mph</a>, and up to 15% more fuel than driving at 50mph.</p> <h2>2. Plan your journeys</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337653798\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2008/09/16/SatnavSony.jpg\" alt=\"Satnav system\" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A satnav system. Photograph: Sony</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sony</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It sounds obvious but don't get lost - it wastes fuel. Use a map, know where you are going, use a satnav system, ask for directions, or use an online route planner like the <a href=\"http://www.theaa.com/travelwatch/planner_main.jsp\">AA's</a> or the <a href=\"http://route.rac.co.uk/\">RAC's</a> to help. Plan where to buy fuel so you don't end up buying it at a motorway service station, which are up to 10p a litre more expensive, according to the RAC. The <a href=\"http://www.petrolprices.com/\">Petrolprices.com website</a> shows you where to find the cheapest filling stations - and you can register to receive an alert when prices in your area change.</p> <p>Plan what you need to do before you go so, where possible, you only make one journey instead of lots of little ones. In the same vein, don't drive around looking for a parking space - park where you can and walk the extra block. </p> <h2>3. Maintain your car</h2> <p>Keep your tyres properly inflated and the car will run more efficiently, saving you money on fuel. Take the roof rack off to streamline it - this can increase fuel efficiency by up to 5%. Empty the boot of unnecessary clutter - each 50kg of weight means you burn an extra 1%-2% fuel. Keep your car regularly serviced and change the oil regularly - this stops minor problems becoming big, expensive ones. </p> <h2>4. Cut the cost of your MOT</h2> <p>The government sets a <a href=\"http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Motoring/OwningAVehicle/Mot/DG_4022514\">maximum price for an MOT</a> test and garages don't tend to compete much - although members of some motoring groups do get discounts at some test centres. But you can keep a lid on extra expenses. If you are concerned about a garage persuading you to have work done that doesn't really need doing you could use an MOT centre run by your local authority. These places deal mainly with council vehicles, but also offer MOTs to regular drivers. They have no incentive to artificially inflate minor problems into expensive repair work. Find a list <a href=\"http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/travel/cheap-mot#find\">here</a> or ask your council.</p> <h2>5. Don't pay over the odds for car finance</h2> <p>The initial outlay is the most expensive part of owning a car - and if you don't buy it outright with cash then you will also have a loan to repay. So don't simply sign up for the first one offered to you in the car showroom; these are invariably expensive, with high rates of annual interest. Shop around, using a price comparison site such as <a href=\"http://www.moneysupermarket.com/refusedcredit/CarFinanceFinder.asp?IsCar=1&amp;alternativeSource=MSCARFINANCE\">moneysupermarket.com</a>.</p> <p>Savings can be considerable. The current best buy on the site is a Barclaycard personal loan of \u00a34,000 repaid over 36 months. This would have repayments of \u00a3124 a month and cost \u00a3482 in interest (APR 7.8%). The worst buy is a Real Personal Finance loan with monthly repayments of \u00a3217, and APR at 64%, which would cost \u00a33,843 in interest payments alone over the life of the loan.</p> <p>If you have an expensive car loan or finance deal then switch to a cheaper one - it's often as simple as switching credit cards.</p> <h2>6. Save on insurance</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337653799\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2008/09/16/CarsDavidLevene.jpg\" alt=\"Cars in storage\" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: David Levene</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The cheapest way to slash car insurance costs is to lie - pretend your car is kept in a garage down a quiet country lane at your mum's house when you fill in the form. Unfortunately, as well as being illegal, you'll also get caught out if you need to make a claim. The safest way to cut your costs is to drive carefully and build up your no claims bonus. And of course shop around for the best deal on the price comparison websites. Be thorough - you need to search several to cover most of the insurance market. </p> <p>If you search moneysupermarket.com, gocompare.com, Confused.com and OnlyInsurance.com you will cover almost 90% of the market. Direct Line doesn't deal with price comparison websites, so it is worth visiting its website for a quote. Once you have this, ask if your own insurer will match or better the deal - it's surprising what a bit of haggling can do. Many insurers impose a charge for monthly direct debit payments so if you can, avoid this by paying a full year's premiums upfront. </p> <h2>7. Consider pay-and-claim breakdown cover</h2> <p>There are <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2008/jun/16/motorinsurance.insurance\">two main types of breakdown cover</a>: pay-and-claim or full service. Pay-and-claim tends to be cheaper, and uses local garages to rescue you and do the work. You pay for it and send your receipts in to claim the money back. Full service outfits, meanwhile, get you back on the road or to a garage without asking you to foot the bill. Check the policy and decide what is most suitable for you - many cover the person not the car, others offer cards for partners.</p> <h2>8. Shop around for your car</h2> <p>Work out what type of car you want, then use websites such as <a href=\"http://www.glass.co.uk/\">Glass</a>, <a href=\"http://www.whatcar.com/\">What Car?</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.parkers.co.uk/\">Parker's</a> to establish how much you should be paying. Once you've found a car that fits, haggle - it's expected. </p> <p>Don't buy a brand new car - you save literally thousands of pounds by buying the same model with a few thousand miles on the clock. January is often a good time to buy - dealers are strapped and there are fewer buyers about.</p> <h2>9. Convert your car to liquefied petroleum gas </h2> <p>This sounds like a lot of work, but high mileage drivers can recover their set-up costs quite quickly. Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is half the price of petrol or diesel, and will take you just as far. A conversion costs around \u00a32,000, which means if you spend \u00a370 a week on petrol an LPG system will pay for itself in under a year. Converting doesn't mean getting rid of the petrol tank - you can keep that and flick from LPG to petrol using a dashboard switch. The only downside is the tank, which takes up a big chunk of the boot. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.drivelpg.co.uk/\">Drivelpg</a> is a good place to start and has a handy <a href=\"http://www.drivelpg.co.uk/savings_calculator.php\">savings calculator</a> and <a href=\"http://www.drivelpg.co.uk/map/index.php\">map of LPG stations</a> in the UK. If you live in London, LPG conversions are also often exempt from the congestion charge - find out more at the <a href=\"http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/fleet/cityschemes/congestioncharge/\">energy saving trust</a>.</p> <h2>10. Ditch the car</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337653800\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2008/09/16/CycleChristianSinibaldi220.jpg\" alt=\"Cycle lane sign on the road\" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The ultimate way to cut costs is to walk, cycle, take a bus, <a href=\"http://www.liftshare.org\">lift share </a> or join a <a href=\"http://www.nationalcarshare.co.uk\">car sharepool</a>.

  "<p>The average house price fell by 0.5% in the three months to the end of July, despite recovering over the month, according to government figures released today. </p> <p>The communities and local government department said the average <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/property\">property</a> cost \u00a3217,171 in July, a slight increase on June's average price of \u00a3215,029. This slowed the quarterly rate of price falls - in the three-months leading to April the housing market saw a drop of 1.3%. </p> <p>Homes for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/firsttimebuyers\">first-time buyers</a> were 1.6% less expensive than in July 2007.</p> <p>Overall, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/houseprices\">house prices</a> were 0.3% lower in July than in the same month last year - a fraction of the falls reported by mortgage lenders. Both Halifax and Nationwide have reported <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/aug/28/houseprices.property\">double digit house price falls</a> over the past 12 months.</p> <p>A spokesman from the DCLG said: \"When looking at trends in the market it is important to remember that UK house prices are significantly higher than five years ago.\"</p> <p>According to the department, prices in July were 40.9% higher than five years ago.</p> <p>\"The current issue affecting the market is largely about the supply of credit - a very different situation to the early 90s, which was about high interest rates and unemployment. The fundamentals underpinning the market remain sound with long-term demand for housing, low interest rates, and low unemployment,\" the spokesman added.</p> <p>However, Howard Archer, chief UK economist at Global Insight, said there was continued \"downward pressure\" on the market, stemming from \"extremely weak market activity, stretched buyer affordability and tight lending conditions.\"</p> <p>Archer said: \"Consequently, it seems odds-on that house prices will head downwards for some considerable time to come, particularly as lending conditions could well tighten further in the near term, at least amid the current turmoil caused by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/16/marketturmoil.lehmanbrothers\">the collapse of Lehman Brothers</a>.</p> <p>\"Very negative housing market sentiment heightens the risk that house prices will continue to fall sharply for some time to come. In addition, unemployment is now rising at an accelerating rate, which increases the likelihood that people will have to sell their house for 'distressed' reasons. This would lead to more houses coming on to the market and would be liable to depress prices.\"</p> <p>Archer predicted house prices would fall by 15% in 2008 and 12% in 2009. \"Consequently, house prices are seen to be falling 26% in nominal terms from their August 2007 peak of \u00a3199,612 on the Halifax measure to stand at \u00a3147,478 at the end of 2009,\" he warned.</p>",
  "<p>In normal circumstances, the revelation that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/16/inflation.interestrates\">inflation rose to 4.7% last month</a> would have been the news of the day. No question, the fact that Mervyn King had been forced to write a letter to Alistair Darling explaining why the cost of living was running at almost two and a half times the government's 2% target would have had the City abuzz.</p> <p>These, though, are clearly not normal times. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketturmoil\">global financial markets are one gigantic car crash</a> and traders have other things on their minds. Whether they will still have a job at the end of the week, for example. So while today's data from the Office for National Statistics was important, it had far less impact on the markets than the big jump in July that was announced last month.</p> <p>That's not entirely surprising since three things have changed since mid-August. The first is that the markets were fully braced for a bad figure today in a way that they were not last month. </p> <p>Then, the increase in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/13/inflation.creditcrunch1\">annual inflation rate from 3.8% to 4.4%</a> came as a bolt from the blue. Now it is pretty much taken as read that inflation as measured by the consumer prices index will peak at 5% - or perhaps a little higher - over the next couple of months. Today's inflation figure was perhaps a little above what the City had been hoping for, but only by 0.1 points.</p> <p>The slump in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/oil\">oil prices</a> is the second thing to have changed the inflation outlook. Crude prices peaked at $147 in early July and were already coming down by mid-August. But over the past four weeks, concerns about the health of the world's banks and the prospect of an impending recession have turned the decline into a rout. Oil prices are now $90 a barrel and heading considerably lower. That means there is a good chance that inflation is now close to a peak. On some measures it already has peaked: the all items retail prices index and the RPI excluding mortgage interest payments both registered small falls in August.</p> <p>Unless the Bank's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/interactive/2008/jul/22/monetarypolicy\">monetary policy committee</a> believes that there are going to be second round effects from the rise in food and energy bills, there is every reason to expect inflation to fall sharply back towards its target over the coming year. One reason for concern is that the core measure of inflation continues to edge up and now stands at 2%. But of far more importance is the quiescent state of the labour market: workers simply do not have the bargaining power to drive up wages in response to the rising cost of living.</p> <p>The final reason why mid-September is so different from mid-August is, of course, the state of the markets. For once it is not hyperbolic to say that it is mayhem out there. </p> <p>Investment banks are going bust; hedge funds are short-selling the shares of any institution that looks vulnerable; survival is a day-by-day affair. In these dire circumstances, policymakers have the perfect alibi if they want to cut rates. They simply have to argue that the potentially devastating deflationary impact of the market implosion outweighs any upside risk from rising commodity prices that have already gone into reverse.</p>",
  "<p>Whether <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/16/labourleadership.labour\">Labour's national executive</a> decides to send out nomination papers for a leadership election today is virtually irrelevant. There are only 20 months left before a general election has to be called. During this period a recession will bite, bringing with it large-scale job losses, price pressures on the living standards of working people and a reining back of public expenditure, as tax incomes dry up. The Brown government is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/16/labourleadership.gordonbrown\">increasingly in disarray</a>, with no apparent strategy to deal with the recession other than to blunder on, prone to an ever-present threat of destabilisation from byelection losses, depressing polling figures and backbench panic. New Labour's response is to degenerate into a rerun of yesterday's Brownite versus Blairite faction fighting without a single policy difference between them.</p> <p>Its only apparent hope is that a Barack Obama victory will result in a dramatic change in US economic policy to kickstart the world economy in time to prompt some revival in Britain's economic fortunes prior to May 2010. Even some of the most optimistic estimates of the depth and timing of the oncoming recession render this electorally ideal timetabling of recovery highly unlikely. </p> <p>Most now accept that the consequences of New Labour's failure could be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/15/labourleadership.labour\">catastrophic</a> for the Labour party with the election of a Conservative government on the basis of a large-scale loss of Labour parliamentary seats. </p> <p>Despite call after call from party members and trade unions for policy change to save Labour from annihilation at the next election, Gordon Brown retreats further and further into the bunker, seemingly cut off from the political realities the rest of us are having to face up to. Time is rapidly running out for a Labour administration to demonstrate it has listened, learned and changed policy direction. </p> <p>New Labour strategy rests on blaming the global <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">credit crunch</a> for the economic and social pressures to which our people are now subject. This is a forlorn hope, especially as there is an increasing appreciation of the role New Labour's advocacy of neoliberalism and the supremacy of the free market has played in bringing about this latest crisis of capitalism. </p> <p>This year's Labour party conference may be the last chance for the party to save the government not only from defeat at the next election but also from the prospect of a very long period of opposition. </p> <p>The left will seek to save this government from itself by advocating forcefully a radical change in political direction. At least this will demonstrate to many of our supporters that there are still socialists and socialist policies within the Labour party worth fighting for.</p> <p>Others within the Labour party who claim to be the so-called \"centre left\" appear to be accommodating to a Cameron victory already and are extolling the Cameron agenda in the same way that some became permeated with Thatcherism. </p> <p>Let this fashionable Labour's Notting Hill set of Compass Cameroons continue to \"emote\" and let us on the left get on with organising to prevent the Tories taking power or failing that preparing the ground for the inevitable fight back.<br> The time before the next election is extremely limited, so the left needs to focus on what effective interventions can be made to maintain some basis of support to serve as the foundation for the future. The only prospect of maintaining an electoral base for the left is to thoroughly distinguish itself from New Labour at every opportunity.</p> <p>Within the Labour party, the left must use every opportunity to present a visible alternative to the analysis and policies of New Labour in parliament, within party structures, conferences and forums, including utilising the platform of any possible leadership election, while commencing targeted work now to support the campaigns of Left MPs and candidates to secure their seats;</p> <p>Within the trade unions, the left should be seen to be promoting and supporting campaigns to protect members against the impact of the recession and to press for action from government, working within and developing broad left structures and backing industrial action in solidarity;</p> <p>Within the wider left and progressive social movements, the aim of the left should be to promote joint campaigning to create a broad united front to expose the real causes and consequences of the recession and to defend those most affected as it hits their jobs and living standards.</p> <p>This Labour party conference, the <a href=\"http://www.conventionoftheleft.org/\">Convention of the Left</a>, which takes place at the same timer in Manchester and the forthcoming LRC annual conference will offer the opportunities to discuss the political situation, but more importantly the aim will be to formulate a clear programme of action for the next 20 months to demonstrate quite clearly that there is the basis for a broad united front in opposition and as an alternative to the neoliberalism of a New Labour or Tory government.</p>",
  "<p>Dearer energy bills sent Britain's annual <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/inflation\">inflation rate</a> to a 16-year-high of 4.7% last month but Bank of England Governor Mervyn King said inflation was close to peaking because of tumbling oil prices.</p> <p>The increase from 4.4% in July leaves inflation at more than double the government's 2% target and forced King to write an explanatory letter to Alistair Darling today.</p> <p>In that letter King said inflation would soon peak at around 5% and then fall back, although he cautioned it could remain above 2% - the Bank's government-set target - until well into 2009 because of the recent fall in the pound's value which could push up import prices. That meant, he added, that he would be writing further letters at three-monthly intervals to the chancellor.</p> <p>He said that the recent weakness in the economy, which is likely to continue well into next year, would help dampen wage pressures and prices. \"As a result the monetary policy committee still expects inflation to fall back sharply in 2009 and to fall back to target thereafter,\" King wrote.</p> <p>Despite the recent fall in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/oil\">crude oil prices</a>, the ONS said that past increases in the cost of energy had pushed up household gas and electricity bills, adding 0.3 points to the inflation rate as measured by the consumer prices index.</p> <p>Food prices also added to inflationary pressure last month, but these were offset by cheaper petrol as garages cut prices in response to the cost of crude oil coming down on global markets.</p> <p>And oil prices continued to fall today, with US light crude futures shedding a further $4 a barrel to trade at a seven-month low of $92.50 a barrel, 37% down over the past three months. That is likely to push prices at the pump further down.</p> <p>The ONS said that last month's inflation rate was the highest since the series officially started in 1997, but using historical data officials calculated it was the highest since April 1992.</p> <p>CPI inflation has more than doubled since the start of the year, when it stood at 2.2%, and has been above the government's target in every month since May. While the Bank expects price pressure to abate sharply in 2009, its nine-strong monetary policy committee has been reluctant to cut interest rates while the cost of living has been rising.</p> <p>The ONS reported that the so-called core measure of inflation - which strips out housing, energy and food prices, had continued to rise and now stood at 2%.</p> <p>James Knightley, economist at ING, said: \"The fact that the core rate rose to 2% shows that inflation is no longer just concentrated in food and energy, which will cause some concern at the Bank. Indeed, with household inflation expectations at an all-time high the Bank is likely to remain concerned about the potential for second round price effects. This suggests to us that we will need to see a marked deterioration in financial market conditions to get a near-term rate cut.\"</p> <p>The City had been expecting CPI inflation to rise to 4.6% this month, but most analysts believe that falling oil prices will leave the Bank scope to cut rates later this year. Other measures of inflation showed a more encouraging trend last month, the ONS said. The headline retail prices index - the benchmark for most pay deals - slipped from 5% to 4.9%, while the RPI excluding mortgage interest payments - edged down from 5.3% to 5.2%.</p>",
  "<p>Peter Moore thought he could win the console war with Dreamcast. He was wrong. Sony's ingenious PR foiled his plans, but for Moore, this was just the beginning. Part Two of our interview, takes him from the collapse of Dreamcast to the heights of Microsoft's ambitions for Xbox - ambitions that could well have destroyed the Nintendo we know today...<br><br><strong>What was the key lesson you took out of the failure of Dreamcast?</strong><br>You know, failure's a tough word! It didn't quite get there. I was angry with Sony at the time, but in their shoes I probably would have done the same thing. They did a tremendous job \u2013 and it's a story they repeated in 2005 with Killzone \u2013 where they promised the consumer something they probably believed they were going to deliver, but they never did. PlayStation 2 - it was the emotion engine it was games coming to life, Real Player was going to be on there, a full network browser\u2026 and they just never delivered. </p> <p>But what they did was place doubt in the consumers' mind. It was pre-emptive guerrilla PR, in the same way that three E3s ago I got lambasted for what I did with Xbox for 360, because I was determined we were going to show real footage even if it was alpha or beta. And then Sony came up with that Killzone video \u2013 and they still haven't shipped the game! Have you seen the video?! The game will never be the video! But what they did again was they placed doubt. I mean it's a classic PR tactic. </p> <p><strong>So going back to Dreamcast vs PS2, you felt the impetus slipping away\u2026</strong><br>It was a horrible period because, all of a sudden, you could sense consumers thinking twice about Dreamcast. I was $199, it was the first online console, we had some great games \u2013 SoulCalibur, Sonic Adventure, Trickstyle, Ready 2 Rumble. When you look at them today, you chuckle, but they were on the cutting edge graphically at that time\u2026 </p> <p>But [Sony] were brilliant at FUD \u2013 you know, fear uncertainty and doubt. It was a massive FUD campaign. The consumer thought twice and they started to read, 'can the Dreamcast make it?' It had a tough time in Europe, it had a really disastrous time in Japan. My job was\u2026 my personality was such that I'll go up and start being a little more on the front foot\u2026 It was like, 'well, what do you do?' You just do it yourself. You start talking, you don't wait for the Japanese to give you messaging \u2013 because PR is something they don't do very well, they just don't do that concept of messaging and having passion around the message \u2013 the only thing we could do was be passionate. But it was too little too late unfortunately. </p> <p><strong>So you were at Sega for another two years after that\u2026</strong><br>Yeah, my job was to transition the company from being a hardware company, which it had been for two decades, and off I go to Nintendo and Sony\u2026</p> <p><strong>Was that a difficult time?</strong><br>It was not optimistic. We had developers, Yuji Naka, Yu Suzuki, all these people who had never worked on anything other than first-party hardware. And now we're saying you need to go multi-platform, and it was just not comfortable for them whatsoever. You don't just one day say 'well we're just going to go from our Dreamcast dev kits to our PS2 or Xbox.' Microsoft set up a deal for us and we started to work on things like Crazy Taxi and bringing them over to Xbox \u2013 we did I think an 11 title deal. </p> <p><strong>And in the end you fell out with your bosses in Japan, because they were still relying on arcade conversions when the rest of the world was playing GTA. But how did this lead to your arrival at Microsoft?</strong><br>Robbie Bach called me to wish me a merry Christmas and asked how I was doing. I said I'm not too good, I'm fed up of trying to convince Japan that we need to either go off and hire western developers or really change what we're publishing and developing in Japan, because the western world is really starting to take over, and the Japanese developers were being marginalized. And Robbie said well if you would ever consider coming here, there's a home for you at Microsoft.</p> <p>So in January (2003) I flew up there and had lunch with Steve Ballmer and you don't say no to Ballmer. We had a great lunch and he convinced me that Microsoft was going to take on Sony; so I get to put on my suit of armour, get on my horse and take on Sony again \u2013 but with a little bit more money this time! And I said yes.</p> <p><strong>Was Ballmer interested in what you'd achieved at Sega or in your attitude as a businessman?</strong><br>He wanted my attitude, he didn't care what I'd achieved at Sega, he wanted to know how I was going to win for Microsoft, how we were going to take on Sony, how would we compete with \u2013 or acquire \u2013 Nintendo. Those were the conversations in those days. It was a classic build or buy conversation. Xbox had launched but it was an aggressive black box for shooters, and how do we evolve that, how do we build the next Xbox, how do we get after Sony? Interestingly, we were just completely fixated on Sony \u2013 Nintendo didn't even come into the conversation. But Steve was very compelling, particularly when you're one-on-one with him in his office \u2013 we talked about what we'd done to compete with Sony, where I felt their weaknesses were. But the bigger picture for Steve was, we need to get into the world of consumer entertainment. There's a role for Microsoft to play, we truly believe in Xbox as being something that can\u2026 there was a little bit of a concern with Sony \u2013 we wanted to keep them out of the living room, from a software and services perspective. And then I started work at Microsoft on February 1 2003. <br><strong><br>And what did Ballmer hope you'd bring to the table?</strong><br>I had on-the-ground fighting experience in Japan, so when I started, I took over Japan, because we were just a disaster there. And then being British I also had the European group and then it quickly evolved into a global role, running Xbox Worldwide. But in me, you're not getting a 'poring through Excel spreadsheets'- type of guy. You get the face of the business, someone who can be there in a broader role, leadership, speak for the business, give it a little bit of personality - and then you hope that the smart people then bring it all along behind you. And, boy, there are plenty of smart people at Microsoft. </p> <p>So we built the 360, and those were tremendous times. We were watching the clay models being built, trying to decide what to call it. Doing the mnemonic shhhhh noise when it boots up \u2013 I can remember sitting in a room listening to 50 little one second mnemonic noises til we got it right. A whole day working on that. And then, the shape of the 360, we actually built 20 prototypes to confuse the bloggers \u2013 we took pictures of them all and then we just spread them around the web, just to confuse everybody. </p> <p>And then one day in Redmond I said, 'I'm sick of consoles being launched with massively expensive ad campaigns, I'm going to do this differently'. So I called up MTV, because my relationships were still good from the VMAs, and I said, 'can I do a 30 minute show'\u2026 I said to my head of PR, we're not going to launch this like any other console, we're going to do it on MTV, we're going to do a 30 minute show \u2013 I didn't use the term infomercial but that's what it ended up being.</p> <p>And then we built a thing called <a href=\"\" http: www.microsoft.com xbox zerohour.htm>Zero Hour</a>. We went out to Area 51 and took over a hanger and we said, we're going to talk to the community in a very different way - we're going to pick 5000 people \u2013 I think we did it online \u2013 and they're all going to drive out to the Californian desert where UFOs are usually spotted, and we're going to take over one of the world's biggest hangers - it was phenomenal. And for 24 hours before we launched we let people play with the games, thousands of fans \u2013 we did it at a grassroots level rather than the big glitzy affair with Dreamcast \u2013 we really re-defined the way a console is launched. </p> <p><strong>Were you specifically responding to the growth of the blogging culture?</strong><br>Yes, because we wanted online \u2013 we knew we were going to build Xbox Live and we were going to build it even more aggressively than we did on Xbox. I don't think the word blog existed back in 2003, but we knew we had to talk to our community. The brand had to evolve from black and aggressive - it needed to be organic. We went to Japan and worked with a company called Hers to give us that concave shape - when you look at it, it relaxes you. We took all the sharp edges out - otherwise we were going to get the same 25 million people and lose the same two billion dollars again. You need to scale the business. </p> <p>And then we went and did three of the wackiest TV commercials you've ever seen. One was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoA5mC5FgIw\">Standoff</a>, which in fact you never saw because it was banned. Well, it wasn't banned, I couldn't get it through Microsoft \u2013 one of the greatest videogame commercials ever. I thought it was brilliant. We filmed it in Buenos Aires in a railway station - we loved this idea of play and we came up with this idea of 'Jump In' as a tagline. We wanted to do ads that had nothing to do with videogames, we didn't want to advertise videogames, we wanted to advertise fun.</p> <p>But Standoff was a little different, it was a little risky. I showed it one morning to the head of corporate marketing at Microsoft and she said, 'over my dead body will you ever run this spot on TV'. I went ballistic \u2013 it's cops and robbers, it's cowboys and Indians, it's what we did as kids! But we never ran it\u2026 we didn't need to because it's been seen millions of times on YouTube...</p> <p>That's how we got the Xbox 360 out \u2013 and you're talking multi-billion dollar risks, taking on Sony\u2026 and it wasn't just videogames, it was, where does Microsoft go in the home? And what is the tip of the spear? Well, it's Xbox 360 \u2013 and Xbox Live was going to be \u2013 and it is \u2013 the biggest social network ever attached to a television \u2013 that was the concept we were always working to.</p>",
  "<p>Maybe because we grew up with him, maybe because - like the Beatles or Stonehenge - he's always been there, it's easy to forget exactly how strange Noel Edmonds is. It's not like he's coy about his eccentricity. He sees no contradiction, for example, in being the face of BBC light entertainment and leading <a href=\"http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article4753618.ece\">a boycott of the licence fee</a>. Then <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1055732/My-dead-parents-melon-sized-orbs-New-Age-Noel-Edmonds-bizarre-air-rant.html\">in an interview at the weekend</a> he spoke about being followed by two \"melon-sized orbs\" which he believed were his dead parents. \"Conventional photography can't pick them up but digital cameras can,\" he said. \"I've got loads of photographs of me at home with two orbs that visit me.\" Not to mention <a href=\"http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/news/article25476.ece\">his views on immigration</a> \u2026</p> <p>The focal point for his leftfield ideas is <a href=\"http://sky1.sky.com/noels-hq\">his current project Noel's HQ</a> which aims to \"fix broken Britain\". Edmonds was happy to expand upon this, addressing the viewer on the show: \"You clearly feel frustrated and at times angry at the tidal wave of new rules, regulations and laws that have been introduced in the name of health and safety, security or the environment.\"</p> <p>Oh dear. You would have hoped that Edmonds would appreciate health and safety regulations. On the Late Late Breakfast Show in 1983, a series of stunt drivers took turns jumping a row of cars leading to Guy Skippon's car screeching onto the trackside narrowly avoiding spectators and Rich Smith's hospitalisation. A clearly shaken John Peel, providing the commentary, beheld a scene as harrowing as any late-night Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten session.

  "<p>In an ideal world, the amount of money we spend on medical research to prevent or cure a disease would be proportional to its seriousness and the number of people who suffer from it. In the real world, 90% of the money spent on medical research is focused on conditions that are responsible for just 10% of the deaths and disability caused by diseases globally.</p> <p>In other words, the diseases that cause nine-tenths of what the World Health Organisation refers to as \"<a href=\"http://www.who.int/topics/global_burden_of_disease/en/\">the global burden of disease</a>\" are getting only one-tenth of the world's medical research effort. As a result, millions of people die every year from diseases for which no new drugs are in the pipeline, while drug companies pour billions into developing cures for erectile dysfunction and baldness.</p> <p>But blaming drug companies is too easy a response. They cannot justify <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/07/health.nhs\">developing new drugs</a> unless they can expect to recoup their costs through sales. If they target diseases that affect affluent people, or people living in countries with national health insurance, they will be able to patent any new drugs they discover. For the 20 years that the patent lasts, they will have a monopoly on the drug's sale and be able to command a high price.</p> <p>If drug companies target diseases that affect only people who are unable to pay high prices for drugs, they cannot expect to cover their research costs, let alone make a profit. No matter how much their directors may want to focus on the diseases that kill the most people, the current system of financial incentives means that if they did so, their shareholders would remove them, or their companies would soon be out of business. That would help no one. The problem is with the system, not with the individuals who make their choices within it.</p> <p>At a meeting in Oslo in August, <a href=\"http://www.yale.edu/macmillan/igh/\">Incentives for Global Health</a>, a nonprofit organisation directed by Aidan Hollis, professor of economics at the University of Calgary, and Thomas Pogge, professor of philosophy and international affairs at Yale, launched a radical new proposal to change the incentives under which corporations are rewarded for developing new medicines. They suggest that governments contribute to a health impact fund that would pay pharmaceutical companies in proportion to the extent to which their products reduce the global burden of disease.</p> <p>The fund would not replace existing patent laws, but would offer an alternative to them. Pharmaceutical companies could continue to patent and sell their products as they do now. Alternatively, they could register a new drug with the heath impact fund, which would set a low price based on the drug's manufacturing cost.</p> <p>Instead of profiting from sales at high prices, the corporation would become eligible for a share of all payments made by the fund over the next 10 years. The size of the share would be calculated by assessing the contribution the drug has made to reducing death and disability.</p> <p>The beauty of the scheme is that it gives economic support to the idea that all human lives are of equal value. For products that drug companies register with the health impact fund, corporations would get the same reward for saving the lives of Africans living in extreme poverty as they would get for saving the lives of wealthy citizens of affluent nations.</p> <p>The most potentially lucrative targets would become the diseases that kill the most people, because that is where a breakthrough drug would have the biggest impact on global health. Moreover, companies would have an incentive to produce and distribute drugs at the lowest possible price, because only when the poor could use them would the drug save the greatest possible number of lives. A company might choose to allow cheap generic copies of its drug to be made in developing countries, because that would enable it to be used more widely, and to save more lives \u2013 for which the Health Impact Fund would reward the company that registered it.</p> <p>Hollis and Pogge estimate that about $6bn a year would be required to enable the fund to provide a sufficient incentive for drug companies to register products that target the diseases of the poor. That figure would be reached if countries accounting for one-third of the global economy \u2013 say, most European nations, or the United States and one or two small affluent nations \u2013 contributed 0.03 % of their gross national income, or three cents for every $100 they earn. That's not a trivial sum, but it isn't out of reach, especially considering that affluent nations would also benefit from cheaper drugs and from medical research that was focused on reducing disease rather than on maximising profits. </p> <p>In cooperation with <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2008</p>"
