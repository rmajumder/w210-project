  "<p>October was a month that creaked and cracked. The insurance industry, already deeply implicated in the international financial crash, was battered by the fall-out from <a href=\"http://hurricanegustav.wordpress.com/2008/09/30/fast-facts-hurricanes-ike-and-gustav-92908-2/\">hurricanes Ike and Gustav</a>. Their bill is estimated to be around $30bn (\u00a318.2bn), far higher than predicted, according to Lloyd's of London. To show that God has a dark - you could call it \"carbon black\" - sense of humour, in the same month the oil giant <a href=\" http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7694508.stm\">BP's quarterly profits</a> of \u00a36.4bn cracked another record high, while Shell's rose to \u00a36.6bn.</p> <p>The sky creaked in another way too. Relentless coverage of global warming, a deluge of green corporate claims, legislative flurries and a redesign of government departments should suggest progress on climate change. But the figures tell another, worrying tale. Far from going down, the global growth rate of carbon dioxide emissions is spiking upwards. Findings from the <a href=\"http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/\">Global Carbon Project</a> this month showed that the global average percentage rise since the year 2000 is now over three times higher than the previous decade, rising again significantly in the last year. These growth rates are now worse than the worse case scenario used by the <a href=\"http://www.ipcc.ch/\">UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> (IPCC) to model potential global warming. Levels of carbon in the energy mix for both rich and poor countries are also going up.</p> <p>Government confusion here in Britain was captured by two stories. In one, Ed Miliband, new minister at the new <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/\">Department for Energy and Climate Change</a>, announced the government's commitment to cutting emissions by 80% by 2050. In the other, the <a href=\"http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23573710-details/Pollution+curbs+delayed+to+let+Heathrow+expand/article.do\">Evening Standard</a> reported that \"ministers are planning to water down EU pollution curbs in order to allow Heathrow airport to expand\". Attempts at satire prove redundant. And the heat on the government over Heathrow is rising.</p> <p>It was a victory, but not a straightforward one when, after relentless pressure, the government announced that greenhouse gas emissions from aviation and shipping would finally be included in targets for the <a href=\"http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm70/7040/7040.pdf\">climate change bill</a>. The quirk comes from the fact that not all emissions are the same. It is unclear whether the government has understood that the full global warming impact of emissions from aviation can be up to five times greater than their headline carbon figure. Because of the particular chemistry of emissions from planes, and where and how they enter the atmosphere, tonne-for-tonne of carbon, aviation emissions are far more damaging than those from road, rail or sea.</p> <p>Elsewhere in the international system, however, there were glimmers of bolder visions. The <a href=\"http://www.unep.org/\">United Nations Environment Programme</a> (UNEP) announced a new green economics initiative. It adopted the moniker of a \"green new deal\", echoing the report of the same name published in July. At the UNEP launch the head of UNEP, Achim Steiner, lambasted what he called the \"totally inadequate\" response of public policy both to climate change and a range of other ecological crises. The environment secretary Hillary Benn, sitting to his right, just about managed to keep a straight face. </p> <p>Last month saw another more literal cracking, of sea ice. According to research from the Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling at University College London, in some areas Arctic sea ice was up to <a href=\"http://www.nerc.ac.uk/press/releases/2008/56-seaice.asp\">one fifth thinner</a> than usual for the time of year. </p> <p>It's now 19 years since the Berlin wall came down, drawing the line under the old Eastern bloc. For all its brashness, triumphalism and smug self-satisfaction, finance-driven capitalism has managed to reign supreme for fewer than two decades before falling apart. </p> <p>No one is more synonymous with the era of financial liberalisation than Alan Greenspan, former chairman of the US Federal Reserve. Under cross-examination by the US House oversight committee his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/24/economics-creditcrunch-federal-reserve-greenspan\">words</a> were heavy with the pathos of shattered illusion and hubris brought to earth, \"I discovered a flaw,\" he said, \"in the model that I perceived is the critical functioning structure that defines how the world works.\"</p> <p>But in the aftermath, in Britain and the US, there are intriguing possibilities. Following nationalisation of much of the finance sector, two governments formerly wedded to light touch, or even absent regulation, find themselves owning, in effect, great swathes of their countries' economies \u2013 banks, homes, buildings, infrastructure and much else besides. Gordon Brown said that now is a time of new and innovative thinking. He is now in a direct position to influence the investment policies and revolutionise the energy use and efficiency of much the economy. </p> <p>It may be that governments still entangled in the habitual rhetoric of free markets, are embarrassed by their new, unaccustomed role. It could be that, having outsourced the exercising of power to the market place, they feel unpractised and not sure what to do. But the climate clock is still ticking \u2013 even speeding up. And, they now have an enormous opportunity to do what democratically elected governments are meant to do \u2013 take responsibility and protect their people from disaster.</p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Simms is taking the global temperature each month as he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/01/climatechange.carbonemissions\">counts down</a> the 97 months before the world enters a new, far more perilous phase of global warming.</p>",
  "<p>At a reception last month, I was collared by one of the architects of New Labour who took it upon himself to walk over and lecture me on the electoral folly of <a href=\"http://www.compassonline.org.uk/\">Compass</a>, on whose management committee I sit.</p> <p>His assessment of why Labour has been trailing in the polls was simple: Cameron &amp; Co have been following the New Labour formula and Labour, of late, has not. Never mind that the New Labour strategy was cooked up for a completely different era before the advent of mass email and internet usage, 9/11 and, latterly, the near-collapse of the world financial system. Labour has struggled since Brown took over because it has failed to follow a recipe that worked a decade ago. For my adversary, \"After New Labour\" means \"More New Labour\".</p> <p>Warming to his theme, he fell into the usual, cheap, lazy intellectualism of many of his ilk \u2013 a kneejerk response which says that anyone who dares to suggest we need more regulation of the market to ensure it serves more of the people (and not the other way round) wants to take Labour back to the \"suicide note\" policy agenda of the early 1980s that led to electoral ruin. Again, never mind that no one in and around Compass is suggesting the imposition of marginal rates of tax of 83%, unilateral nuclear disarmament or the common ownership of all means of production, distribution and exchange (ironically, nationalisation appears to be all the rage now).</p> <p>My accuser was wrong on both counts. The New Labour formula, at its crudest circa 2003-04 (Labour's 1997 manifesto was quite \"left\" in comparison), was predicated on a cynicism and a pessimism about the British public. In part, there was the desire to triangulate policy to the right in order to attract Tory voters, in the belief that your own supporters would stay put with nowhere else to go. As it happened, more than 4.5 million simply stopped voting altogether or drifted into the hands of the Liberal Democrats or, worse, the BNP. There was also the view that the British people are conservative (with a small \"c\") and not susceptible to a political message that seeks to appeal not only to the desire to improve one's personal circumstances but those of society at large too. There is no better evidence of the fallacy of this than the outrage expressed across the political spectrum and all socio-ecomomic groups at last year's 10p tax abolition.</p> <p>No, after New Labour must come an honest exposition of what Labour is all about \u2013 building a fairer, more equal, democratic and sustainable world \u2013 and an attempt to popularise these notions in the way that Thatcher did for the beliefs of Hayek, Friedman et al. Labour has got to stop running scared for fear of offending and make the case for its politics.</p> <p>But how? The \"living wage\" \u2013 highly desirable in my view \u2013 provides a good example. Let's give the debate around that issue some emotional texture. We do not just strive for a society in which every person has the opportunity to reach their full potential (all parties lay claim to that); we want to build a society in which whatever talents people have, they are rewarded with a comfortable standard of living when they apply them. Why? Because it is not fair to leave it to the market \u2013 as we do at present \u2013 to attribute a salary to a job of work which barely pays to put food on a plate or keep a house warm. Green issues \u2013 which touch on matters of life and death \u2013 provide even more fertile ground to make these emotional arguments and there are numerous others.</p> <p>My point is that it is not difficult to articulate and popularise our politics in this fashion. More importantly, if ever there were a time to do so, it is now, when the forces of individualism and laissez faire are in retreat and interventionist thinking is on the up. Some say Labour missed an opportunity, following the 1997 landslide, to do this \u2013 to embed its values into the fabric of this nation in a way which would endure every bit as long and strong as Thatcherism. Well now we have our second chance.</p> <p><em>\"After New Labour\", the second debate in the \"Who owns the progressive future?\" series, organised by Comment is free and <a href=\"http://www.soundings.org.uk/\">Soundings journal</a>, will take place in London at <a href=\"http://www.kingsplace.co.uk/\">Kings Place</a> on November 3 at 7pm.

  "<p>Have the wise men just arrived early for Barclays? Out of the east come visitors bearing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/31/barclay-sovereignwealthfunds\">valuable and vital gifts</a> for this organisation which like all the other British banks has found itself in some difficulty over the past few months. </p> <p>A price has had to be paid for the years of complacency, arrogance and pomposity from the bankers and the result we now all know: a global banking crisis which has even brought the part-nationalisation of some British banks. However, some have avoided this and one in particular has stood alone in rejecting the need for state aid and interference. </p> <p>Barclays has always held its independence dear, and the idea of state support is a complete anathema to it. So where to go for help and support? Well, I suspect the policy was something on the lines of ABB \u2013 Anywhere But Brown!</p> <p>Barclays is a complicated operation with a blend of more traditional retail domestic and international banking, one of the world's greatest credit card brands, and a totally opaque Barclays Capital investment banking operation. A successful business, yes \u2013 and it has even turned in a profit this week (something which will stand it apart from some dreadful banking figures coming up over the next few weeks), but one which has also been damaged by the global banking crisis.</p> <p>Barclays therefore has done its best to avoid the interfering hand of government in its day-to-day operations which any shareholding must inevitably involve. After all, civil servants would probably make even worse bankers than the bankers.</p> <p>The last thing Barclays would want is to have the government busybodies peering into the dark halls and cupboards of the Barclays empire. Whatever skeletons any of us have, none of us want them brought out into the critical and non-expert light of the politicians.</p> <p>So Barclays have sent out their ambassadors to try and find willing supporters to keep them out of those political clutches. The result has thus been the loans from the Gulf. Loans at a price, but what price freedom from government interference? For one thing this will allow Barclays to carry on with its banking and lending policies in its own way: those banks that have now taken the \"Queen's shilling\" will also find themselves at the behest of the government's idea of banking policies. </p> <p>Does this mean that Barclays has lost its independence? In my view no, but it has bought time, which is going to be so crucial to allow the wounds in the capitalist monetary system to heal.</p>",
  "<p>The body of Corporal Sarah Bryant, the first female British soldier killed in Afghanistan, was buried in July this year at the Cumbrian church where she had been married two years earlier.</p> <p>Bryant, an intelligence specialist killed with three SAS reservists when their Snatch Land Rover was blown apart by a Taliban bomb, had spent less than five months at home with her husband during that time.</p> <p>Her coffin was draped in the union flag, with her beret, belt, campaign medals and a single red rose on top. She was, her husband <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/jul/07/military.afghanistan\">Carl said in a tribute</a>, \"a one-off, a truly unique person\".</p> <p>But Bryant was also one of 34 British service personnel killed in lightly armoured Snatch Land Rovers, a vehicle mired in controversy for most of the time since its deployment to Iraq and Afghanistan.</p> <p>The government's failure to replace it with a vehicle providing more protection from enemy forces is \"cavalier at best, criminal at worst\", Major Sebastian Morley, the head of the SAS reservists in Afghanistan is understood to have written in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/nov/01/sas-commander-quits-afghanistan\">his resignation letter</a>.</p> <p>Snatch Land Rovers, originally designed as a vehicle to transport troops in Northern Ireland, are referred to by soldiers as \"mobile coffins\".</p> <p>\"You drive over a landmine in a very-lightly armoured Land-Rover Snatch - it's not much different from driving over it in a Ford Escort,\" a former member of the Royal Green Jackets who served in Iraq, Steve McLoughlin, said.</p> <p>Snatch Land Rovers were originally deployed due to their speed over rough ground and manoeuvrability. The British also had lots of them left over from Northern Ireland.</p> <p>But MPs on the Commons cross-party defence committee were critical in a <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmselect/cmdfence/1241/124102.htm\">2006 report</a> about the vehicle's lack of armour and urged the government to immediately purchase an \"off the shelf\" replacement.</p> <p>\"It is unsatisfactory that the lack of capability was not addressed with greater urgency much earlier,\" the report said.</p> <p>In June this year, MPs were still expressing \"deep concern at the vulnerability of British troops\" deployed in the vehicles in a cross-party motion, tabled by Tory Bernard Jenkin. </p> <p>And in August, Susan Smith, of Tamworth, Staffordshire, launched a damages action that alleges \"failures\" relating to the use of Snatch Land Rovers.</p> <p>Her son, Phillip Hewett, 21, a private in the 1st Battalion Staffordshire Regiment, died on July 16 2005 in a roadside bomb attack on three armoured Snatch Land Rovers. Two other soldiers died in the incident in the Amara province of Iraq.</p> <p>It was only this week that the government announced that British troops in Afghanistan would be supplied with 600 new armoured vehicles under a \u00a3500m deal agreed between the Ministry of Defence and the Treasury.</p> <p>They will include Mastiffs, a version of American Cougars adapted for the army by a Coventry-based company, about a hundred smaller but heavily-armed 4x4 Jackal patrol vehicles, and a number of lighter vehicles to replace the existing fleet of Viking personnel carriers.</p> <p>But they are not expected to come into service until next year at the earliest, with some fearing they may not be operational until 2010.</p>",

So this is a rare thing: all of the big four playing on a Saturday, three of them at 3pm, one of them at home to <em>a team called Hull who are above them in the league</em>.</p> <p>While you'd fancy Chelsea (home to Sunderland), Manchester United (home to Hull) and Arsenal (away to Rory Delap) to win, this is yet another big day in Liverpool's march to an apparently pre-ordained 19th title, 19 years after the last one. They visit a rejuvenated Tottenham at 5.30pm: a gimme two weeks ago, but a really tricky test now. But that's for Scott Murray later in the day. In the meantime, we've got Everton v Fulha<em>COME BACK</em>m now, and then all those 3pm kick-offs.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>12.42pm</strong> \"I've got a feeling about this game\" says Andy Gray, taking Sky's predilection for overhyping even the most unpolished of wotsits to new levels of indignity. It's Everton v Fulham for heaven's sake!</p> <p>\"Morning Rob,\" says Alex Netherton. \"'Human frailty, it makes me sick sometimes.' Oh wait, I mean Danny Murphy.\" For some reason, and in spite of little factors like a) him scoring the winner at Old Trafford three years in four, b) him being Danny Murphy and c) see a), I've always had a soft spot for Danny Murphy. Such a classily unobtrusive footballer, not unlike myself, and despite disturbing reports of shell suits, generally someone with more going on between the lugholes than most footballers. </p> <p>Big big congratulations, incidentally, to my nephew Ciaran, who today passed his 11+ with flying colours. He's already the brainbox of the Smyth family; well, look at the competition. He's off to celebrate with fizzy pop and pizza. Imagine being 11 again!</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>12.47pm</strong> They've kicked off. \"Afternoon, Rob,\" says Declan. Folk are so polite today. \"Have you heard the backing track to Parry &amp; Gray's team analysis on the Goodison tannoy? Not one, not two but <em>three</em> execrable 70s stylee, \"Everton, Everton\" themes. Z-Cars to follow, thankfully.\"</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong> Whip on your anorak, let's have us a party, woo-hoo</strong> I found a great stat yesterday. Eric Cantona is the fastest to 50 assists since football began, in 1992, having done so in 96 games. And the second-fastest in 99 matches? Not Henry, Cole, Bergkamp, Giggs or Lyttle, but Mikel Arteta.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>12.53pm</strong> Nothing has happened so far. Sweet diddly. <em>Nothing</em>. These sides are a point apart in the bottom half of the league, although Fulham, with 11 to Everton's 12, have a game in hand. Everton, perversely, have yet to win at home this season; Fulham, predictably, are yet to win away.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>12.57pm</strong> The first half-chance of the game. Cahill on the left waited for Arteta to overlap before sliding the ball down the line. Arteta then cut a cross back to the near post, where Pienaar's flicked header went straight at Schwarzer.</p> <p>There's a fairly open, almost lazy feel to the game, with both sides lacking an orthodox cruncher in the centre of midfield (Fulham have Bullard and Murphy; Everton have Fellaini and Osman), but so far neither side has found anything resembling a rhythm.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>1.01pm</strong> Alan Parry makes the inevitable comparison between Fellaini, who for the uninitiated sports some Spandex-tight corkscrew curls, and the Scousers in Harry Enfield. Still, at least we had 13 minutes' grace before he could wait no longer to tickle the nation's ribs. Still not much going on. It's not a negative game, or even an especially poor one. It's just a game between two mediocre sides.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>1.08pm</strong> \"Just one question,\" says Gary Naylor. \"Why?\" Well nobody told me that scented string vests had gone out of fash- oh hang on, there's a bit before that from Naylor. \"I hope nobody in the crowd is too hungover - just one look at that purple and yellow ball would induce vomit from the strongest stomach.\" Do they not always use them?</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>1.10pm</strong> What I said at 1.01pm was a lie. This is poor. It's still open - only four fouls in the first quarter, as Andy Gray points out in what is in no way an attempt to justify his pre-match assertion that he had a feeling about the game - but there's a startling lack of quality.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>1.13pm</strong> \"Afternoon Rob,\" says Neill Brown. \"Like you, I am at work today. And, like you, I am staring at a screen with nothing interesting going on (accrual spreadsheets since you didn't ask). Still, as Arsene Wenger's considered a top manager, I'm going to follow his example and give up work 15 minutes early today because apparently my work will all be done by then.\" Is that funny? I honestly can't tell anymore.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>1.14pm</strong> Can you be done for plagiarising yourself? Because really all I want to do is repeat the 1.10pm entry. Bullard scrunches another one wide from distance. Fulham have played some unpleasant stuff in midfield, but up front they have nothing. Well, they have Andy Johnson and Bobby Zamora. So, yeah, nothing.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>1.15pm</strong> Fellaini, who clearly has quite the eye for goal, picks up a loose ball on the edge of the box and almost passes it onto the near post. It bounces clear and, just as Yakubu is about to blast inexplicably over an open net from six yards, Aaron Hughes nips in front of him splendidly to clear.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>1.19pm</strong> Big chance for Fulham. Bullard curves in a lovely cross from the right to Zamora six yards out. His header is smothered by Howard, but the ball breaks to Johnson on the edge of the six-yard box. Instead of shooting, he decides to pause, consider the meaning of life, stick his hands on his hips in the camp style and then smoke a nice cigar. By the time he's done so, the chance has gone.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>1.20pm</strong> Now <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0dghVN8ZWw\">this</a> is funny. That much I do know.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>1.25pm</strong> <br>Here's Gary Naylor. \"Is it me or is the quality of football in the Premier League and Champions League poorer this year than for a few seasons? Liverpool are the leading team, but haven't really played well consistently, there's no one player who is outstanding and the crises in goalkeeping and refereeing have produced more goals than moments of sublime skill. After a splendid Euro 2008, the fare on offer in the Premier League looks very second best. The hype merchants keep telling us that club football is better than international football, but it's not.\" I think Euro 2008 was a fluke, glorious though it was, and that football generally is much poorer than it was back in the day. Goalkeeping is at a particularly low ebb. In fact so is humanity, but goalkeeping especially.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>1.27pm</strong> Filth. Abject filth. \"What's currently puzzling me is why there is a group of what appears to be about 20 red-uniformed Chelsea pensioners near the corner flag on Everton's left wing,\" says Declan. \"Have they invaded? Or maybe defected?\" You couldn't really call them glory-hunters, could you. What's the phrase for when you downgrade teams?</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>1.29pm</strong> Hangeland uses Fellaini like he's a Krypton Factor prop, jumping all over him in the penalty area. As Andy Gray says, 99 times out of 100 that's a free-kick outside the area, but the ref, Lee Mason, wasn't interested in giving what, technically, was a clear penalty.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>1.31pm</strong> \"Re: Naylor at 1.25pm,\" begins Neill Brown. \"The outstanding player of the season so far is Frank Lampard. Make of that what you will.\" Lampard remains farcically underrated, mainly because people can't see the wood for their own <em>trees of hate and envy</em>. I think Lampard's the greatest/most influential player in Chelsea's history, although I realise that, with their modest past, that's not a million miles from winning a 'best moment on Soccer AM' competition.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>1.34pm: Half-time: Everton 0-0 Fulham</strong> I look forward to seeing Richard Keys talk this one up. It was garbage. Everton were the least-worst: Fellaini hit the post and then should have had a penalty when Hangeland put his hands where he shouldn't in the penalty box. But it was a half of depressingly low quality. Still, come back in 15 minutes! It'll be better! Honest! Please!</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>1.36pm</strong> \"Yo yo Robert,\" says Alex Perkins. \"Fellaini is a dead ringer (yes, pun intended) for Dustin Diamond aka Screech from TV's Saved by the Bell.\" I was more a My So-Called Life kinda gal.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>1.48pm</strong> \"In no way was I discrediting Lampard, Rob,\" says Neill Brown. \"My point was that he has stood out in a spectacular fashion in all of Chelsea's games so far but has only looked decent in the international games. I think Gary has a good argument as to the quality of international v club football.\" Oh I wasn't having a go at you \u2013 if I was I'd have slipped in an eff and a cee and some lame joke based on your surname \u2013 but just making a general observation.</p> <p>I totally disagree that international football is better, though. Most of the big teams are all over the show at the moment, and England would get hammered by any of the big four. Heskey, Torres, Berbatov, Drogba or Adebayor? Case closed, Columbo.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>1.50pm</strong> The fun's over and the second half has started. \"In this instance, they're more dumpster divers than glory hunters,\" says Ben Smith of those blokes mentioned in the first half.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>1.51pm</strong> It's an indictment of how poor international football is, in fact, that Andy Johnson has played it. He's done nothing today except wear premature baldness with elan.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>1.55pm</strong> Big chance for Everton. Arteta's stepover on the left gives him half a yard against Pantsil, who doesn't really those last two letters given how well he performs, and he kisses a lovely cross to the back post where Cahill, charging in among the bodies, thumps a header over from six yards. For a finisher of his quality, that was close to a sitter.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>1.58pm</strong> One of the Sky mics picks up somebody - no idea who - using the phrase \"effing ballboys\". That's the Daily Mail's front-page story for Monday sorted.</p> <p>\"'What's the phrase for when you downgrade teams?' quotes Gary Naylor. \"Is it 'I've decided to support my local team' (spoken in a Bristol accent)?\" That's not as good as your Welsh accent.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>2.01pm</strong> The odd thing about this game is not that it's been garbage - welcome to the Premier League, ladies and germs - but that it's been so lethargic. For Fulham, so poor away from home, that's fair enough: a draw is a draw is a draw. But for Everton it's less explicable, especially given how they got in among Manchester United last week. They are, as someone once said, cheating their manager.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>2.02pm</strong> Gera hits the bar, but he should have scored. A corner from the right went all the way across the box, from where Zamora hung up a delightful ball for Gera, running in unmolested, to thump a header off the bar from six yards. Unlike Cahill a few minutes ago he was under no pressure, and had more momentum from his run, so that goes down as a criminal miss.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>2.05pm</strong> \"Lampard is underrated that's true, but is he really better than Gianfranco Zola?\" says George Templeton. \"I know I haven't watched football for as long as many people and I am no Chelsea fan, but Zola was magnificent and from what I've seen/read, was magnificent most of the time he graced the pitch for Chelsea?\" That he was but \u2013 and I know this isn't the answer to everything \u2013 look at their medals' cabinets. Fwank has been the most important attacking player in by far the best period in Chelsea's history, which will do for me. It's official: I Heart Fwank.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>2.06pm</strong> Everton substitution: Saha on for Fellaini, a decision greeted with widespread boos. Cahill will drop back into midfield, with Saha going up top. Fellaini has been pretty impressive, but I understand the decision: Osman is the nominal sitting player, so he had to stay on, and Cahill is such a goal threat that he wanted to keep him on. Cahill and Fellaini isn't a realistic centre-midfield pairing.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>2.08pm</strong> The feistometer has gone up a notch or two: 1, 2, 3, 4 you might say. First Johnson left a foot in on his old team-mate Osman, and now Schwarzer feels the joy of Yakubu's boot after he dropped a cross.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>2.12pm</strong> If every single attacker on the pitch did not require post-it notes to enable them to distinguish between elbow and derriere, it would be about 3-3 because the defences remain open. Cahill puts in a sly leg-deadener on Bullard: the ball was still sort of there, enough to make it look like an honest attempt to play the ball, but he knew what he was doing. But Bullard is up and looks fine now.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>2.15pm</strong> Bullard shoots, at a conservative estimate, 974 miles wide.

Bullard coaxes a lovely free-kick over the wall which Howard, diving across goal from left to right, can only fist straight out in front of him. It comes to Zamora, inside the six-yard box but at a slight angle, and he can only scuff it across goal, past the two defenders running back, and onto the far post. A pretty pith-poor effort, in truth.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>Portsmouth v Wigan team news</strong></p> <p><strong>Portsmouth</strong> James, Johnson, Campbell, Distin, Belhadj, Diop, Diarra, Davis, Armand Traore, Crouch, Defoe.

Under Moyes, Everton have played their best football in a 4-1-3-1-1 formation, with the first of those \"1\"s allowing the other \"3-1-1\" to play.\" I agree completely about Carsley, but surely you couldn't play Fellaini in a straight 4-4-2, which is what they're playing with Saha and Yakubu on.

He humped it downfield and, as Mark Schwarzer came to collect, Yakubu eased his not inconsiderable backside into Schwarzer - manoeuvre that has served man very well on Carling-stained dancefloors but here only produces a foul: it sends Schwarzer flying in the comedy style and allows the ball to plop into the net. They wouldn't have given that for the home side down the road, never mind at Goodison.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>Man Utd v Hull team news</strong> The best midfielder in England, Michael Carrick, returns for his first game in almost two months.</p> <p><strong>Man Utd</strong> Van der Sar, Neville, Ferdinand, Vidic, Evra, Ronaldo, Carrick, Anderson, Nani, Berbatov, Rooney.

The excellent Osman pings in a lovely dipping cross from the right and Saha, seven yards out, nails a firm header to the right of Schwarzer, who gets a hand on it but can only help it into the net. That's harsh on Fulham in truth, but Everton will not give a flyer, and nor should we as - thank goodness - this game is nearly over.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>2.38pm. Full time: Everton 1-0 Fulham</strong> So Everton finally win their first home game of the season and, almost absurdly given the gloom surrounding the club of late, move up to seventh for the time being. They are still not playing well, but it does seem that that well-earned draw against Manchester United was a turning point. Since then they have claimed two wins and, almost more importantly given their early-season travails, two clean sheets.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>2.41pm</strong> \"Ah the medals argument which I will counter with the money argument,\" says George Templeton. \"Zola was never in a team that spent the kind of cash and thusly had the glittering array of talent that Lampard has been surrounded with. No doubt Lampard has been one of the key figures of Chelsea's reign at or near the top, but don't you think Zola could've just as well if Chelsea had a sugar daddy owner like they do now. My argument is that if Zola had the opportunity to play as many big matches as Lampard, he would've come up trumps just as many if not more times. Admittedly my judgement might be clouded by his performance against England. But look at us, neither one of us are Chelsea fans and we're debating this, I wonder what they think?\" That, alas, would require <em>more than two people to be reading this</em>, but fair play for trying.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>2.52pm</strong> \"I'm trying to concentrate on designing a newsletter for a firm of Property Consultants, but Danylyk listed in the starting line up for Altrincham?

Sorry about that: I just poured coffee all down my silk pink waistcoat in hilarious fashion.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>3.05pm: Manchester United 1-0 Hull (Ronaldo 3)</strong> Reality is starting to sink its seriously sharp teeth into Hull's collective dusters. That goal was devastatingly simple: Berbatov played the ball infield from the right and Ronaldo, back to goal, controlled it with his right foot and then turned to sweep it in off the near post with his left from 18 yards. An excellent, precise finish, and <em>he even smiled</em>. It's his sixth of the season. Who says he can't get 42 again?</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>3.06pm</strong> \"As a follow up,\" says James Sparling, \"you might be interested to read that <a href=\"http://www.football.co.uk/altrincham_town/players/anthony_danylyk_115516.shtml\">Danylyk's stats</a> give a new meaning to the whole size zero debate... He is the oldest, shortest and lightest person in existence.\"</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>3.13pm: Rory Delap 1-0 Arsenal (Fuller 11)</strong> Delap's first long throw brings the first goal, headed in by Ricardo Fuller. That was absurdly simple: the throw missed out the hordes at the near post and found Fuller, one one one against Toure at the back post. Fuller climbed all over Toure, legitimately so, and planted a header into the corner from five yards.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>3.14pm: West Brom 0-1 Blackburn (McCarthy 13pen</strong> \"Losses after 86-match unbeaten runs at home are like buses coming as they do all at once,\" says Ian Copestake, \"so I fully expect Chelsea to lose again today. However, there is a Sunderland shaped hole in this scenario.\" Chelsea are, as you'd expect, all over Sunderland like a cheap one, but haven't had too many dangerous efforts as yet.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>3.21pm: Middlesbrough 0-1 West Ham (Mullins 18)</strong> How contrary are Middlesbrough? They get results when you never expect them to and then go 1-0 down to West Ham. And Hayden Mullins. He smacked it in off the bar after making a mess of the chance originally, and West Ham have a decent chance of ending their run of four straight defeats. In other news, at Fratton Park, Peter Crouch has hit the bar for Portsmouth against Wigan.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>3.23pm: Man Utd 1-1 Hill (Cousin 23)</strong> Reality has just snapped one of its front teeth on Hull's rock-hard swingers: they've equalised through Daniel Cousin! Vidic was penalised for having a feel of Marlon Link's polyester and, from the inswinging free-kick by Andy Dawson, Cousin flicked a superb header across Van Der Sar and into the corner. That's a really good goal.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>3.29pm: Chelsea 1-0 Sunderland (Alex 27)</strong> Chelsea resume normal service: Alex scores their 1000th Premier League goal from a distance of approximately 0.4 yards. The lovely thing about this is that it was from open play and yet it's the centre-back who scores: Alex gave it to Lampard 40 yards out and kept running. It eventually went to Joe Cole, who cut in from the right and drove it goalwards with his left foot. Fulop couldn't hold it, plunging to his left, and Alex did the rest, although he might just have been offside when Cole had the shot.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>3.31pm: Manchester United 2-1 Hull (Carrick 29)</strong> England's best midfielder, Michael Carrick, scores a fine goal. It was a beautiful counter-attack, starting with Vidic just outside his own six-yard box. He found Rooney, he found Berbatov, he found Carrick, and he took two touches on the run before sweeping a daisy-cutter across Myhill and in off the post from 17 yards. Lovely stuff, with shades of Andrei Kanchelskis's semi-legendary goal at Carrow Road in April 1993, particularly in the way that it began with a first-time 40-yard pass from the centre of defence.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>3.32pm: Chelsea 2-0 Sunderland (Anelka 30)</strong> Nicolas Anelka seals the game for Chelsea. Already. Lampard crossed, Alex took a touch and Anelka - coming from what looked like an offside position - stole the chance from him like that little git used to do in the playground, scoring from a few yards.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>3.36pm</strong> Anyone out there?</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>3.38pm</strong> Benni McCarthy has been sent off at West Brom for two yellow cards - he hadn't been booked for over a year before that - and Paul Ince is going ballistic. The second was for deliberate handball. \"Anelka is a goal thief!\" screams George Templeton, as if this were the height of deviancy.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>3.42pm</strong> Charles Antaki isn't in a good place, all told. \"What's the point trying to listen out for an Arsenal equaliser while working on my FreeCell average?

Arsene knows!</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>3.46pm: Man Utd 3-1 Hull (Ronaldo 44)</strong> Just 35 to go now. Nani's outswinging corner is thumped in by the head of Cristiano Ronaldo at the near post.

Amr Zaki whacks it straight down the middle for his ninth of the season.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>3.48pm: Chelsea 3-0 Sunderland (Anelka 45)</strong> Chelsea score a goal that isn't offside, with Anelka ending an excellent move to grab his second of the game.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>3.51pm</strong> So, the half-time scores.</p> <p>Chelsea 3-0 Sunderland (1-0 if you only count goals that are onside)<br>Man Utd 3-1 Hull<br>Middlesbrough 0-1 West Ham<br>Portsmouth 0-1 Wigan<br>Rory Delap 1-0 Arsenal<br>West Brom 0-1 Blackburn</p> <p>And in the evening kick-off it's Spurs 0-1 Liverpool.

Any good?</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>3.59pm</strong> \"Surely the Man Utd score is only 1-1 if you discount the goals scored by a twonk\" ahahahahahahahahahahahahahas Ian Copestake.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>4.03pm</strong> The second half begins. \"Frank Lampard is underrated only by opposing fans, not by the press or Chelsea fans,\" says Liban Saleh. \"Also, Steven Gerrard is the best midfielder England has (and I'm a United fan), whilst Carrick is England's best passer.\" Gerrard and his fan club can guzzle on my fun-shapes. He is unstoppable, yes, but only one game in every 50. And his short passing game \u2013 the most important thing in a midfielder where I come from \u2013 is non-existent.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>4.06pm</strong> Roy Keane has made a half-time substitution, bringing on El-Hadji Diouf for Martyn Waghorn. Sadly the horse, unlike Triggs, is not going come back the moment Roy calls it. And apparently Keane has been sent to the stands, probably for pointing out, maybe in creative language, that the first two goals were offside.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>4.09pm</strong> \"Hi Rob,\" says Russell George, procrastinating from his work, Oxford, it says here. \"I once shamelessly stole a goal from a team mate during a cub match. I honestly thought it was OK to run 30 years to tap home a shot that was trickling in anyway, and didn't understand the reaction of my team mate afterwards. If Richard (I think) who played for the Thaxted Panthers around 1985 is reading this, I'm sorry. It was a title decider, and I realised at an early age that this might be as good as it got. I was right.\" You ran 30 <em>years</em>. Firing up the DeLorean for a smidgin of self-validation is pretty tragic.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>4.11pm: Chelsea 4-0 Sunderland (Fwank 51)</strong> Fwank scores his customary goal, but this is bigger than most: it's his 100th in league football. It was all about Joe Cole, really. He skinned McCartney on the right of the box and stood up a lovely ball to the back post. Fwank, six yards out, strained his neck muscles and eased his header to the right of Fulop.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>4.14pm: Chelsea 5-0 Sunderland (Anelka 53)</strong> Any camerman worth his salt would focus on Roy Keane's phizog right now, but for the time being they're showing repeats of Anelka's hat-trick goal. Malouda broke down the left and played it across the face of goal for Anelka, eight yards out, to stretch and stab it in via the goalkeeper Fulop. Now they cut to Keane, who is sat in the stands and chewing his gum with a ferocity that makes it seem like the most foreboding thing in the history of the world. I don't think Wrigley's will be offering him a deal.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>4.16pm: West Brom 1-1 Blackburn (Bednar 55)</strong> We've waited a long, long time for Roy Keane's meltdown.

It was a corner from the right, by Rooney this time, and Vidic at the near post bundled it first-time under Myhill from about eight yards.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>4.21pm</strong> \"Russell George (4:09pm) didn't use his DeLorean,\" says Mac Millings. \"I heard he actually played cub football for 30 years before finally scoring. Which was not only sad but, by the end, a little creepy.\"</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>4.22pm: West Brom 2-1 Blackburn (Miller 62)</strong> A screamer from Ishmael Miller has put West Brom in front against ten-man Blackburn. Here's an email from Qasim Nauman, who has chosen to presume that our tens of readers already know which team he supports. \"I was following the scores of the United and Chelsea matches, until I realised the utter pointlessness of it all: our main competitors this season are Villa, Man City, and maybe Hull for fourth place, especially considering that Alexandre Song is our midfield 'enforcer'.\" Not replacing Flamini was inexplicable. Still, Arsene knows!</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>4.26pm</strong> \"I don't know if you've got Five Live on for the United game but Jan Molby's accent never fails to amuse,\" says Michael Gibbons. \"Like when you mix blue and yellow to get green, it appears if you whisk up Scouse and Danish in a blender you get what sounds like a Dutch morph (little plasticine bloke from Tony Hart's seminal Heartbeat).\" It is, without question, the best hybrid accent ever, although I probably wouldn't want to hear it during pillow talk.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>4.29pm: Man Utd 4-2 Hull (Mendy 69)</strong> Insert your own patronising comment about Hull's spirit here. They never give up, mind: Evra's back header is short and Bernard Mendy - who gave away 12 penalties and scored 14 own-goals in one pre-season friendly - puts something back in the bank by lobbing high over Van Der Sar. Vidic hooked it away from under the bar on the volley but it was definitely over the line.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>4.31pm</strong> Distin and Crouch both head against the bar in the space of about five seconds.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>4.34pm: Rory Delap 2-0 Arsenal (Olofinjana 73)</strong> Oh dear, oh dear. This is a shambles for Arsenal. It was another long throw, flicked on by Fuller (I think). It found Olofinjana, who was six yards out and started staggering before falling over like somebody who'd been in Wetherspoons since midday. As he did so, the ball hit at least two parts of his body, one of which might have been his hand, before scooting past Almunia. \"He's scored it with his tits!\" exclaims Scott Murray across the desk.</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>4.37pm: Robin Van Persie sent off</strong> Arsenal are having the definitive shocker. Van Persie, only just on as a substitute, is given a straight red for a minor assault on the Stoke keeper Sorensen. You know that thing in Fifa 98 when, if you were in a funk, you could just hump the keeper up in the air and get a straight red card? Basically Van Persie did that, thudding into him with his shoulder as Sorensen picked the ball up. Sorensen must wonder what he has done to offend north London, after Alan Hutton rearranged his eye a couple of weeks ago. Arsene Wenger must wonder how on earth Arsenal have tossed away five points - and with it, surely, the title - this week. Still, Arsene knows!</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>4.39pm</strong> \"Speaking of hybrid accents,\" said Qasim Nauman, \"anyone remember Thomas Hitzlesperger's German + Brummie linguistic alloy?\" Remember it? His post-match interview against Villa in 2003 is the most played MP3 on my iPod.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>4.42pm: Man Utd 4-3 Hull (Geovanni 81pen)</strong> This is a joke. United were 4-1 up but Hull are showing remarkable resilience. Ferdinand is penalised for winning a battle of strength with Mendy - there was a tangle of legs but I'm not sure Ferdinand was any more or less culpable than Mendy - and Geovanni does the necessary from the spot.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>4.43pm: Middlesbrough 1-1 West Ham (Mido 83)</strong> Seriously, though: 4-3. W. T. Eff.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>4.44pm: Portsmouth 1-1 Wigan (Kranjcar 82)</strong> Portsmouth get a deserved equaliser, through Niko Kranjcar, after battering Wigan in the second half. At Old Trafford, Wayne Rooney is apparently lucky not to be sent off after having a hack at both Boateng and Ashbee.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>4.45pm: West Brom 2-2 Blackburn (Andrews 89)</strong> Ten-man Blackburn have equalised through Keith Andrews, and <em>if one more person on an unnamed football forum says it's 4-4 at Old Trafford I'm going to remake Falling Down in a postmodern fashion</em>. It's isn't 4-4, it's 4-3. But it's all Hull. I genuinely can't take this.</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>Full time: Chelsea 5-0 Sunderland</strong> But the best bit - Roy Keane's post-match press conference - might yet be to come. At Stoke, Theo Walcott is being stretchered off with what looks like it could be a serious shoulder injury, so Arsenal are down to nine men, and they'll be nine points off the pace when Liverpool win 1-0 at Tottenham later in the day.</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>4.54pm: Rory Delap 2-1 Arsenal</strong> A twice-deflected free-kick from Gael Clichy is surely no more than a consolation for nine-man Arsenal.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>Full time: Manchester United 4-3 Hull</strong> Don't ever put me through that again. Ever.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>4.56pm: Portsmouth 1-2 Wigan (Heskey 90)</strong> That is ridiculous. Portsmouth have hit the woodwork four times, but Emile Heskey has stolen it for Wigan in the final minute, with his 100th Premier League goal from just 9,412,412,723,129 shots.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>Full time: Portsmouth 1-2 Wigan</strong> Twilight robbery.</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>Full time: Rory Delap 2-1 Arsenal</strong> Didn't see that one coming, did you?

Thanks for all your emails. It's been defiantly very.</p>",
  "<p>Last month I wrote about the first and only <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/sep/22/fashion.middleeast\">Palestinian keffiyeh scarf factory</a>, which is struggling to survive even though this symbol of the Palestinian national struggle went from anti-war accessory to high street fashion item. </p> <p>I mentioned that, although the black-and-white chequered scarf has gleaned serious fashion stripes, it was slammed in some quarters as being an <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/jun/01/dunkin-in-a-kerfuffle/\">endorsement of terror</a>. Back then, Israel didn't go for the scarf as fashion item, which I'd assumed was because the keffiyeh's unequivocal political significance was just a bit too close for comfort. But now women have started wearing the scarf in a fashion-y manner, while some of Tel Aviv's boutiques have draped the scarf, fashionista style, around shop window mannequins. </p> <p>\"I think it looks nice, that's why I wear it,\" says one 23-year-old woman in Tel Aviv who is channelling the scarf much like the American celebrity chef <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/chi-rachael-ray-dunkin-donuts,0,6304563.story\">Rachael Ray</a> did for a subsequently banned advert earlier this year. \"We learned it was fashionable from Europe,\" says 18-year-old Kineret, at a central shopping centre, also sporting the keffiyeh as street-trend. Both of these women say they know what the scarf represents and are not wearing it as a political statement. </p> <p>But why the time delay? It's not a seasonal issue, since Israeli teenage girls were wearing fashion-conscious vest-and-cotton-scarf combinations in the stickiest summer months. It's not fashion tardiness, either: Israel may once have had a time-lag in keeping up with global trends, but this is definitely not the case today. </p> <p>\"We saw the trend happen, everywhere, we saw the scarf being worn in a lovely way, as fun, street fashion,\" says Merav Frank, deputy fashion editor at the popular women's weekly, La Isha magazine. \"But for us it's not like wearing a Colombian poncho - it has a whole significance and political association.\" Frank says that this might explain the lag in the fashion uptake of keffiyehs. \"Maybe now that global fashion has forgotten it, we can wear it without the political significance,\" she says. \"We didn't want to miss out on the trend, but it seems some time had to pass before we could do it.\" </p> <p>Kineret, whose teenage friend reveals that she also just bought three keffiyehs, relates that she does sometimes get comments when she wears the scarf at school. \"Some people say to me, 'What, are you an Arab now?' I just tell them they don't know anything about fashion.\" In other words, and not to overstate the matter, it seems that the desire to be on trend has transcended national-political affiliation, even in the country most likely to be touchy about the subject. Those commentators who fumed over \"jihadi chic\" can probably calm down. <br></p>",

For instance, many inhabitants of Congo's North Kivu province and parts of South Kivu, the sites of the latest outbreak of violence, are Tutsis - the same as in neighbouring Rwanda. President Paul Kagame of Rwanda is cynically exploiting common ethnic backgrounds across the two countries. Tutsi rebel strongmen <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3786883.stm\">Laurent Nkunda</a> and Jean Bosco Ntaganda are encouraged, financed and supported by Kagame.</p> <p>All three men are turning legitimate local grievances over lack of government delivery as \"ethnic\" grievances, in order to take political control of the region, and thus control over the mineral resources. The region is rich in minerals, including oil reserves. Kagame is calculating that by supporting Nkunda and Ntaganda during general instability in the mineral rich eastern Congo provinces, he could gain proxy control of the area, and so access its resources.</p> <p>Congo had \"democratic\" elections \u2013 lauded by the west and regional African governments, for nothing more than the fact they took place and that voterigging was not too \"overwhelming\". The winner, President Joseph Kabila, has not governed inclusively, in one of the world's most ethnically diverse countries \u2013 a ready recipe for fuelling ethic tensions.</p> <p>Of course it is not an easy job to hold together such a diverse nation, but the Kabila government has singularly failed to break the perception that it is only serving people from Kabila's own ethnic group. While the government is failing, a very few locals \u2013 mostly from Kabila's ethnic community \u2013 and foreign multinationals are doing well, causing widespread resentment. Congo suffers hugely from food shortages and price inflation. Failures of government are perceived as harming certain ethnic groups more than others; grievances, and hence mobilisation, along ethnic lines come easy.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a post-cold war power struggle for access to the Congo's mineral wealth is played out with Chinese and Indian-owned companies competing with western businesses. All sides are playing Kabila and none have put pressure on him to rule more inclusively.</p> <p>The west's ideological backing of Congolese dictator <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobutu_Sese_Seko\">Mobutu Sese Seko</a> (a so-called pillar of its fight against communism) rather than democratic movements, is partly the reason why the country has been in such a intractable mess. Depressingly, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis western and eastern rivalries over commodities in countries like Congo are likely to get worse.</p> <p>Right now there is also a vacuum in African continental leadership. The African Union is rudderless. The tenuous peace that ended the previous Congo conflict in 2003 held because it was underpinned by active support from the major countries in the region, led by South Africa and to a lesser extent Nigeria, under the auspices of the African Union. Now, both countries have internal leadership problems. Unless the UN sends more peacekeepers to Congo, things will get worse.</p> <p>Yet the reality is that the global financial crisis will mean the west is less likely put money into such extensive humanitarian efforts and peacekeeping operations. The UN security council has been sadly ineffective when western and eastern big-power interests are at stake.</p> <p>Kagame's supporters in the west must press him to step out of Congo; and press Kabila to talk to rebel leaders Nkunda and Ntaganda. At the end of the day, the Kabila government must serve all its citizens equitably. In diverse African societies, inclusiveness and sharing public services is the best guard against ethnic violence.</p> <p>Furthermore, western and eastern support for African countries must involve strengthening long-term democracy building, not just five-yearly elections, as has been the case in the Congo. More likely, unfortunately, is that the combination of ongoing economic and political crises will lead to more such clashes.</p>",
  "<p>\"Ciao, John,\" came the voice from who knows where. A few months ago, it was still possible to meet Roberto Saviano in person, though even then there was no doubt that his safety was in jeopardy. He was already well known in Italy, though not much beyond, as a young author who had written a scorching denunciation of the Camorra, the Neapolitan mafia, and paid for it with threats to his life. In a meeting we had almost a year ago, two police bodyguards searched the cafe and kept him in view from outside. But he could still enjoy a leisurely coffee surrounded by people who had not been frisked.</p> <p>Since then, Saviano has become internationally celebrated. His book, Gomorrah, has inspired an award-winning movie that is Italy's candidate for an Oscar. But the number of his bodyguards has increased to five and now he can only be contacted within Italy by telephone. It took 10 days to arrange. Even then, it didn't happen at the appointed time.</p> <p>The grim paradox of the author's life is that the more famous he becomes, the greater need for him to be invisible, because the more that his book is read, and the more that Matteo Garrone's powerful film is seen, the greater is the heat felt by the Camorra's bosses.</p> <p>\"Most of my problems have come in the last few weeks from a band of camorristi that is going around Campania [the region that includes Naples]. It's a group of between six and 10 people - so quite a small unit - that in six months has caused 18 deaths,\" Saviano said in his first interview with the British media since announcing he was to leave Italy. \"Every time they have struck, I have been moved out of Campania - as far away as possible.\"</p> <p><strong>Symbolism</strong></p> <p>Saviano could not quite bring himself to say that the police believed that he was on a hit list. He said its members \"had in their heads the dream of... [pause] ... striking at symbols, let's say\".</p> <p>He is unquestionably a symbol, not just of the Italy that refuses to be cowed by mobsters, but of the universal right to freedom of speech. A group of Nobel prize-winners, including G\u00fcnter Grass, Orhan Pamuk and Dario Fo, wrote an open letter to the newspaper La Repubblica after it was reported that the godfathers had set Christmas as the deadline for Saviano's elimination. Extracts from Gomorrah have been read in piazzas up and down the country. And more than 200,000 people have signed a petition in support.</p> <p>Saviano said he had been particularly moved by the Nobel laureates' letter. But, after two and a half years of isolation and persecution, the strain is beginning to show.</p> <p>Apart from trips abroad to publicise his book, he said, his life was spent between carabinieri barracks and the offices of prosecutors. He longed for a home \"where I could live for a year, six months ... instead of which I am being moved around. At the start, I could put up with it, accept it was my fate. But now it's driving me crazy.\"</p> <p>It had warped his personality, he said. \"Living shut up like an animal turns you into an animal. You become mistrustful. You think that everyone wants to trick you. You envy other people because they're free. You've had the strength - or the stupidity - to speak out, and they've kept quiet.\"</p> <p>He said he felt as if he were burdened with \"an enormous, gigantic weight that I can no longer carry easily and that is destroying me as a writer\". He had been working on a non-fiction novel, but of late most of what he had written was journalism. He managed to write while being moved between \"safe houses\". \"But it's a difficult business, because concentrating is difficult.\"</p> <p>Several prominent Italians have appealed to him not to leave his homeland, saying it would represent a victory for the mob. But when asked when he planned to go, his answer was: \"As soon as possible.\" Only logistical difficulties stood in the way of exile, and he hoped they could be resolved by the new year.</p> <p>Reviewing the film of Gomorrah, my colleague Peter Bradshaw wrote: \"After the final credits, it is hard to escape the fear, even the despair, that this whole area - all of Naples, all of southern Italy - is suitable only for a rain of fire from the heavens, or maybe a 1,000-year quarantine, like an ethical or indeed literal Chernobyl.\" It is a sensation that anyone who knows the area will instantly recognise.</p> <p>But, said Saviano, \"I'd like to ask people not to consider my story as that of a southern Italian and thus of a man who lives in an underdeveloped country of violent men, but to regard it as a European - very European - story. What I and the others who write on these matters are talking about is the biggest single economic force in the European Union. What affects me also affects Londoners, Berliners and Madrilenians. All the organised criminal cartels invest in London and it is no coincidence that London is among the five cities with the highest consumption of cocaine.</p> <p>\"It is about freedom of speech,\" he said of the issues surrounding his novel and the reaction to it. \"But above all, it is about the freedom of the reader, because what has put me in danger is reading. If what I wrote had ended up in the hands of 20,000 people it would not have generated any problem. What put me in danger is that, because of me, millions of people decided to take an interest in the things that interested me.\"</p> <p>Salman Rushdie said Saviano's position was even more perilous than his own had been, and Saviano agrees. He recounted the story of a mafioso who turned state evidence and was once asked if a death sentence passed by the dons could ever be lifted. \"No,\" he replied, \"Only postponed.\"</p> <p>Despite this, and the global reach of the Camorra, which is one theme of Gomorrah, Saviano seems confident that he will find a way to live safely outside Italy without round-the-clock protection. \"I'm not absolutely sure,\" he said. \"But I think so.\"</p>",

  "<p>Over the past decade, the FTSE 100 index has gone nowhere \u2014 starting at around 4,000 in 1997 and still around that level today. American and European markets have also gone nowhere. The technology-heavy Nasdaq remains almost 70% below its 2000 peak. The Japanese Nikkei, is lying low around 8,000, a far cry from its 39,000 peak way back in 1989. It raises the question \u2014 is this \"buy and hold\" shares strategy for pension investing a load of rubbish? </p> <p>It all depends which periods you use when assessing the performance of equities. The long-term brigade can point to US stocks returning 1.5m% in the 20th century and more than 8% per annum after inflation after 1950. British stocks have averaged real annual returns of 7.5% since 1950. </p> <p>But those figures for 7%-8% annual returns are inflated by a bull market from 1982 to 2000 that now looks like a deviation . The \"irrational exuberance\" engendered by that mighty bull market saw global stocks reach lofty levels, and set the stage for the current decade of underperformance. Yet some uninformed fund managers portray the FTSE's current travails as a kind of freakish aberration. But they are just that \u2014 uninformed. Between 1700 and 1995, UK stocks saw real returns of 4.5% per annum \u2014 good, but nowhere near the 10%-plus that investors became used to in the 1990s. What's more, in the 19th century, there was essentially no difference in returns, whether investing in shares or bonds.</p> <p>A look through the history books reveals that downturns lasting a decade<br>or more are not a stockmarket rarity. In the 1930s, the Dow Jones lost 89% of its value, not returning to its 1929 peak until 1954. US stocks also went nowhere between 1966 and 1982. The US is currently enduring another such cycle, its eighth since 1802. </p> <p>Other countries fared worse. In seven of the 20th century's decades, French investors received no real return and were, after inflation, no better off in 1949 than they were in 1899. The next 50 years were better \u2014 real returns of more than 7% per annum \u2014 although that masks the hunger felt between 1959 and 1982, when stocks declined in real terms.</p> <p>German investors were wiped out twice in the last century (in the 1920s and the 1940s) while Italians saw real returns of just 2.3% between 1925 and 2001. But steering clear of equities altogether might be a costly mistake. Stocks almost invariably beat bonds over the very long-term, even if the margin is not as high as some cheerleaders make it out to be. </p> <p>As for the present, valuation measures suggest that equities are undervalued for the first time in two decades. History shows us that stockmarkets are \"mean reverting\" \u2014 that is, periods of marked underperformance are followed by periods of notable strength. Typically, strong eras are ushered in when pessimism reigns and stocks have been beaten down. </p> <p>Discouraged investors might be cheered up by Nouriel Roubini's thoughts on long-term investment. The New York economics professor has earned the moniker \"Dr Doom\" for his apocalyptic (and prophetic) assessment's over the past 18 months. Just last week he was warning that \"things will get much worse before they get better\" and policy makers might even need to close down markets \"for a week or two\". Horrid stuff. </p> <p>So is Dr Doom shorting this market? No. In fact, he's fully invested in a diversified portfolio of index funds. \"That's how I've invested for the past 20 years and how I'll invest for the next 20,\" he says. \"I take a long-term view.\"</p>",
  "<p>Economics explains everything, again: this time, global corruption and poverty, in a highly readable book by two \"development economists\". Businesses with political ties to the Suharto regime in Indonesia lost stock value after worrying news about Suharto's health, while others didn't; smuggling between China and Hong Kong can be inferred by public trade statistics; UN ambassadors from countries with higher corruption tend to commit more parking offences in New York; civil wars in countries such as Somalia or Chad are much more likely when the rains fail; and witch-killings soar in times of famine. There are occasional casual sops to the idea that \"cultural beliefs do matter\" as well, which I guess will be news to no one but other economists. The argument is not entirely joined up: at one point the authors say conflict called \"ethnic\" usually has economic motives at its base; but they later refer offhandedly to \"ethnic\" or \"religious\" violence in Kenya and Iraq. Most interesting is their persuasive call for a new approach to international aid-spending based rigorously, as far as possible, on controlled randomised trials. They make an analogy with medicine, so why not call it \"evidence-based aid\"?</p>",

Now it is in liquidation - leaving 7,000 employees in shock. </p> <p>\"One day we went to work as usual, the next it was all closed,\" said Wei Sunying, at the gate of the factory in Dongguan, southern China, where she spent eight years painting plastic components in a fume-filled room.</p> <p>\"Thousands of us are looking for jobs now. We walk around every day till our feet ache but we can't find anything.\"</p> <p>Few in the west have heard of Dongguan, but the chances are that your shoes, your TV or your children's toys originated here. Exports have built a city of 14 million inhabitants, almost all migrant workers from the countryside. Its economy has sustained 15% annual growth in recent years. The global economic crisis is proving the final straw for exporters punished by rising costs and stronger currency.</p> <p>In the past year, chill winds have blown through the Pearl River Delta. Sixty-seven thousand small firms collapsed in the first half of 2008, many in these manufacturing heartlands, says the national economic planning body. Toy firms have been particularly badly hit, by safety scares and product recalls. Textile firms, with wafer-thin margins, are also reeling. Next came tighter credit for many foreign-owned firms, like Hong Kong's Smart Union. And then, in the past two months, a sharp drop in US and European consumer demand. </p> <p>A local trade association predicts that by late January, Dongguan and its neighbours Shenzhen and Guangzhou will lose 9,000 of their 45,000 factories. </p> <p>\"Many factories are looking at completely empty order books,\" warned Stephen Green, head of China research at Standard Chartered, who believes the export sector may even shrink next year. Green believes China will see 7.9% growth in 2009 - well below the double digit figures of the past five years.</p> <p>That may sound enviable to western countries facing recession, but with the working age population still growing, China needs to grow by at least 8% to maintain its employment rate. The fall-out will be concentrated in provinces such as Guangdong.</p> <p>\"The social impact of this is going to be huge. The problems are getting bigger and bigger,\" said Wooyeal Paik, researching Dongguan's industry and migrant workforce at the University of California at Los Angeles.</p> <p>\"Disgruntled workers left jobless will complain more ... You will see demonstrations and picketing. And probably there's a risk of violence against bosses - especially foreigners.\"</p> <p>Dongguan's government stepped in to reimburse the Smart Union workers to the tune of 24m yuan (\u00a32.2m) after thousands gathered at the factory gates and outside local authority offices. But two month's back pay - 1,200 yuan for most - will not last long. Wei, from Guizhou, is one of many struggling to find work. \"I came here as a migrant worker because my children need money for schooling,\" she said. New job offers aren't always what they seem, added 26-year-old Fang Jianlin, whose friends were recently conned. </p> <p>\"Recruiters told them the salaries were very good, but they were asked for money. They got robbed; some were even beaten,\" he said.</p> <p>Smart Union was such a popular employer that Fang paid a hefty \"introduction fee\" to get his job there. At worst, he and his wife would earn about 600 yuan a month; at the busiest times, when production ran until 2am, they could take home 2,100 yuan each.</p> <p>It's a tragic end to the dream which lures millions of workers to Dongguan each year, where they struggle and study their way towards the promise of a regular income. At the city's night schools, thousands of workers end their days with classes on every subject from car maintenance to law. Bob Li is one of the success stories. He arrived in 1995 as a labourer; \"everyone in my hometown had heard Guangdong was covered in gold,\" he explained.</p> <p>Now he manages a factory for Richall, supplying durable bags to companies such as Walmart, Carlsberg and Disney. He is unnerved by the economic downturn. \"These days it is getting more and more difficult for factories like us,\" he said, citing the cost of wages and materials. \"The price of our materials has risen because they're made from oil ... Taken together, costs have risen by 30-40%.\"</p> <p>To some extent, Dongguan has become a victim of its own success. The rising prosperity of the region has created inflationary pressures. Workers want higher wages; new labour laws are designed to wipe out sweatshops that bring higher costs which squeeze many companies. Manufacturers have already fled inland to cheaper provinces, in many cases encouraged by Guangdong authorities, who hoped to move the province up the value chain - condensing two hundred years of western industrial development into fewer than 15. </p> <p>\"We have a policy to empty the cage for the new birds,\" Guangdong's vice-governor Wan Qingliang told reporters this month. \"The ultimate target is to build the Pearl River Delta into the core region of modern manufacturing.\" </p> <p>Others are unsure of the wisdom of the policy in the face of a worldwide downturn. \"Places like Guangdong miscalculated the development of the economy. They actually tried to push out those labour intensive and small and medium sized enterprises [SMEs] out of the [established industrial] area because they wanted hi-tech industries there. But when something bad happens, like the economic downturn, what are they going to do?\" said Paik. He acknowledges that numerous east Asian economies have moved up the value chain in the same way, and that the Chinese government deserves to be confident given its economic record. \"But they haven't experienced a serious economic downturn except right after 1989 and have been overconfident in their policy of the quick transformation of industrial structure toward hi-tech in Guangdong,\" he cautioned. The risk is that officials might push the city off the economic ladder rather than up it. Whether subsidies, tax rebates and other support for small firms can save them remains to be seen.</p> <p>Yet China's rising living standards in the 30 years since economic reforms were launched has left most people optimistic about its long-term prospects. Migrant workers returning home think they may come back in a few years.</p> <p>\"If we compare the situation to when I first arrived, I have already found my pot of gold,\" said Bob Li. \"But I can still see it's just the beginning.\"</p>",

Barclays argued that it needed to remain free of government interference. Shares in Barclays tumbled 13% or 26.3p to 178.9p.</p> <p>Its high street rival <strong>HBOS</strong>, which along with merger partner Lloyds TSB and RBS has decided to take government money, recorded its fifth successive day's gain, adding 5.3p to 99.3p.

  "<p>The billionaire sheikh who last month bought Manchester City Football Club was among a group of oil-rich investors that yesterday announced a deal to buy almost a third of Barclays Bank.</p> <p>While the rest of the world hunkers down to take shelter from the financial crisis, the Arab Gulf states, awash with petrodollars as the oil price reached $147 (\u00a391) a barrel over the summer, are still spending freely. Royal families and government-backed funds from the region have been collecting a growing portfolio of assets, including stakes in supermarket chain Sainsbury and the London Stock Exchange, the Chrysler Building in New York and Aston Martin. </p> <p>Sheikh Mansour Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the brother of the ruler of Abu Dhabi, has agreed to pump \u00a33.5bn into Barclays for a 16% stake. The Qatar royal family, one of the most prolific investors in the region, is aiming to build up its existing holding in Barclays to more than 15% by injecting another \u00a32.3bn.</p> <p>The investment was announced as the prime minister, Gordon Brown, was preparing to head to the region for a four-day visit to plead with oil-rich nations to play their part in stabilising the world financial system by abandoning attempts to increase the price of oil by cutting production and by investing their multi-trillion dollar profits in ailing economies.</p> <p>The price of oil has slumped as the faltering world economy has weakened demand but the high prices of recent years have still left many families and governments in the region enormously wealthy. Mansour's family is estimated to be worth $750bn, fuelling speculation that the billionaire would indulge in a game of fantasy football at Manchester City by using his vast wealth to buy up the world's best players. He is minister of presidential affairs, chairman of the Abu Dhabi state oil firm and is married to the daughter of the ruler of Dubai.</p> <p>Mansour's part in the Barclays deal was brokered by Amanda Staveley, a senior partner at the private equity firm PCP Gulf Partners. She owned a restaurant near Newmarket racecourse where she built relationships with some of the wealthy horse breeders from the Gulf region. She also helped to agree the deal to buy Manchester City. She described the Barclays investment as \"a vote for the UK financial system as a whole\".</p> <p>The Qatar investment was led by Sheikh Hamad Bin Jabr Al-Thani, a member of the royal family and the Qatar prime minister. The Qataris already own 25% of Sainsbury's, 20% of the London Stock Exchange and are leading the \u00a31bn consortium to redevelop London's Chelsea Barracks.</p> <p>The Barclays deal allows the bank to strengthen its balance sheet without taking taxpayers' money. Mansour is understood to have been looking at Barclays for some time but contacted the bank when it said it would not take part in the government bail-out. Barclays boss John Varley noted that \"there has been quite a significant shift in the availability of capital and economic power in the world over the past five years.\"</p> <p>Will Hadfield, of the Middle East Economic Digest, said the gulf states have \"very detailed plans to remove their dependency on oil stretching out to 20 or 30 years. They are diversifying away and creating industries not reliant on the oil price and part of that is investing overseas. They are looking for flagship assets, companies with powerful brands that will be around for a very long time.\"</p> <p>Many of the deals are strategic but others, like Manchester City, are part of an eagerness to put the small gulf states on the map. Abu Dhabi hopes to rebrand itself as a cultural oasis by attracting new Louvre and Guggenheim museums and a branch of the Sorbonne, France's most prestigious university. Until the 1960s, the tiny kingdom's main source of income was camel herding.</p> <p>Brown will today take a delegation of 27 British business leaders and two of his closest cabinet colleagues, Lord Mandelson and Ed Miliband, on the visit to drum up support for a three-point plan to help with the downturn. </p> <p>He wants the region's government's to adopt a \"transparent\" approach to oil. In addition, Brown wants the oil-rich states to invest billions of dollars from their foreign exchange reserves into the International Monetary Fund. Brown believes the IMF's $250bn fund, of which $29bn is being pumped into the Hungarian and Ukrainian economies, needs to be bolstered and that countries with large surpluses, principally oil producing countries in the Gulf and China, should shore up the IMF.</p> <p>Downing Street denied Brown would take a begging bowl to the Gulf. No 10 said: \"He is not going cap in hand. He recognises that it is in everyone's interests that there is stability and growth in global markets and that is equally in the interests of the Gulf region. They have significant wealth and resources that can contribute to refunding stability in the global financial system.\"</p>",

The findings showed that the need fort women-only spaces was a disincentive to hiring female employees and that female students were often relegated to unequal facilities. </p> <p>One researcher, Farida Deif, told the Guardian the university would provide better education and employment opportunities.</p> <p>\"This university could be a very good thing if it had colleges offering instruction in engineering, media or law. There are already colleges with nursing and teaching disciplines. These areas are saturated and perpetuate specific gender roles.</p> <p>\"In terms of female education, the Saudi government has made great progress. Every statistic we've seen shows more enrolment in secondary and university education.\"</p> <p>The country still has the lowest female employment level in the world. Unesco figures show that women make up 58% of the total Saudi student population, but only 16% of the workforce. </p> <p>Segregation and the state policy of male guardianship mean women can only work in all-female environments, normally schools and hospitals. Women can lose their jobs if a male guardian informs the employer he wishes her to leave.</p> <p>It is unclear whether the university will have halls of residence. Women do not normally leave home before marriage and would not usually be permitted to move away in order to study. Those women who do live on campus encounter difficulties and constraints. </p> <p>In the course of her research, Deif spoke to medical students in Dammam, where they stayed in dormitories. \"They were severely restricted in terms of mobility and activity. They didn't have the power to leave the dormitory. It was a very closed environment.\"</p> <p>No information is available on how students will travel to the university. Women are barred from driving and public transport is not an option because of segregation. Women rely on a male guardian or privately hired driver. </p> <p>Government officials stressed the university's green credentials. Around 40,000 square metres of solar panelling will provide 16% of the campus's heating and 18% of the power required for air-conditioning.</p>",
  "<p>My father-in-law, Don Corner, died this week. It was very sudden and painless. He'd had a jolly lunch with us on Sunday, felt ill on Monday evening and died on Tuesday night. He was 87, clearly in good spirits up to the end, and, you'd have thought, pretty good health too. </p> <p>It's the way any of us would like to go, and he had been with many of the people he loved most. But a merciful, speedy death is difficult for those left behind, because it doesn't offer a chance to prepare for the grieving ahead.</p> <p>Don was one of what the Americans call the Greatest Generation, those who fought in the last war, stoically, bravely, usually without complaining, often almost enjoying it. War might be long periods of boredom interrupted by moments of absolute terror, but it also offered companionship, travel and a sense of purpose. </p> <p>He stayed in the navy and at one point became naval and military defence attach\u00e9 to Venezuela and Colombia, based in Caracas, from where - he proudly boasted - he never sent one useful piece of information back to London, though he did collect some fine orchids. After he retired he sold antiques in the Lanes in Brighton. I remember sharing a bottle of hock with him the lunchtime before the night of the Grand hotel bomb. He was selling crisp \u00a31 notes for \u00a34. I think there was something odd about them, but I never found out what. He claimed he knew more people who wrote for the Guardian than read it, and it was probably true.</p> <p>He liked beagling, drinking, talking, eating, walking, the Greek islands, and being with friends and family. He was wonderful to me. Unlike some fathers he never judged whether a partner was good enough for his son or daughter, but by what he could draw from them. He wanted to enjoy the people his children loved. He claimed he had never been photographed without a glass in his hand. We will all miss him dreadfully.</p> <p>\u2022 Judging by the papers, it might be a good time to go. Is there some kind of competition for the most panic-stricken headlines? We've got financial chaos, abysses, global collapse and Mad Max meltdown. The green lobby, terrified of being left behind, predicts that the death of the planet is coming much sooner than expected. I keep meeting people who have stopped listening to the Today programme because it sends them out to work with a black cloud drizzling over their heads.</p> <p>Yet even the paper themselves don't seem to take it seriously. Last Wednesday you would imagine that the most important thing going on in the world was the row over Ross and Brand's phone call to Andrew Sachs. (I think the most unsatisfactory thing about Russell Brand is his hair. You know that every apparently wild, straggling, untamed tress has been carefully teased into place.) We in the media seem to veer wildly between apocalyptic prophecies of doom and minuscule trivia, like manic depressives on a day out from the hospital.</p> <p>\u2022 There are joys to cling to. The other day, going to visit my own parents, I stopped in the market town of Wymondham, Norfolk, three miles from their care home. A friend of mine lives in the town, which is lovely. There are winding old streets, a market cross, and the superb Wymondham Abbey, which was started in the 12th century and is staffed exclusively by very nice people. </p> <p>Bill Bryson lives nearby, and he could live anywhere at all. We had lunch in the Green Dragon pub. It was one of those sunny but freezing days, so the wood-fired stove in the snug was quite as welcome as the real ale.</p> <p>And I've had a very agreeable PG Wodehouse sort of fortnight. Ten days ago was the biennial dinner of the PG Wodehouse society. It's strange but comforting to be with hundreds of people who are there only because they share a love of one writer. The guests were an extraordinary mix, including John Mortimer, Lara Cazalet, who is Wodehouse's great-granddaughter, and the Duke of Kent. Dr Shashi Tharoor, who just failed to become secretary general of the UN in 2006, gave a funny, deft speech, ending: \"May the sun always shine on Blandings, may young men always wear spats, and Jeeves resolve the global financial crisis.\" Hal Cazalet performed a Wodehouse song new to me, Tulip Time In Sing-Sing (\"that dear old-fashioned prison of mine\").</p> <p>This week I met Hal's father Sir Edward Cazalet at a party to celebrate the latest reprint of the Wodehouse oeuvre. It was held at the old John Murray headquarters, in Albemarle Street, Mayfair, where the drawing room, one of the most beautiful in the world, always makes my neck hairs prickle. </p> <p>Jane Austen took tea here, as did Byron, Darwin, Betjeman and Disraeli. Sir Edward saw a lot of his grandfather and recalled how he agonised over his scenarios and plots. But once he had sorted them out, he smoothly and speedily wrote that amazing row of books. \"And when he got the Times, he could do the crossword instantly, filling the answers in as if he was writing a letter.\"</p> <p>\u2022 You know Christmas is coming because the mad catalogues start arriving, offering items nobody needs, and which no sane person would give. A remote control for Christmas tree candles. Long-life batteries for your electrically heated insoles. A flexible roll-up shoe horn (\"say goodbye to stiff shoe horn misery\"). A silk sleeping bag to put inside your hotel bed in case of germs. A machine (at \u00a342.50) to clean your CDs and DVDs. My favourite so far - and if you see any more let me know - is a wooden box large enough to contain a bottle of wine, but fiendishly difficult to open. \"Watch in delight as your gift receiver tries to free the bottle from captivity!\" This costs \u00a319.99. In other words, you could send your friends three or four good bottles for the price of one that they can't even drink. What world do these people live in?</p>",
  "<p>Naming a car model a \"Superb\" is a bold and, some might say, fate-tempting move. Rather like the proud parents who decide to christen their son Genius, it creates a daunting expectation to live up to.</p> <p>But attach \"Superb\" to the maker's name, Skoda, and suddenly it seems less a reckless boast than an example of the sort of mordant wit for which the Czechs are justly renowned. One thinks of Milan Kundera's Unbearable Lightness Of Being, a piece of inspired oxymoronic wordplay that, in terms of pure comedy, the Skoda Superb may well surpass. It's as if Genius's surname was Dullard.</p> <p>That's unfair, of course, to Skoda, which has come a long way since the days when it was the butt of all those jokes about the poor quality of the Soviet bloc's consumer goods. Samples: What's the difference between a Jehovah's Witness and a Skoda? You can shut the door on a Jehovah's Witness. How do you get rid of a Skoda? Apply rust-remover.</p> <p>With that rib-crushing weight of mirth dragging on its name, you can appreciate Skoda's desire to puff out its chest and update its image. But, in fact, the first Superb dates back to 1934, when fuel prices were rocketing and the global economy was in ruins. So the auspices appear promising for a relaunch. Actually, the Superb first returned in 2001, but it was widely dismissed as a poor man's Passat, which is, after all, a not-quite-so-rich-man's Audi. For Skoda, like any number of other brands, is just another part of the sprawling VW conglomerate.</p> <p>This new Superb doesn't look superb. Bland would be the word that comes more readily to mind. The Bland, alas, is unlikely to be a name that emerges from a creative meeting of Skoda's marketing department, though I suggest that the Skoda Bland would carry just the right combination of integrity and irony to give the car a discernible modern edge over rivals such as the meaninglessly named Ford Mondeo.</p> <p>That said, the car is not bland to drive. It has the same jaunty gear shifts as the Audi or Passat, and, as with that pair, an engine so finely tuned you could test your piano with it. Nor does it feel as heavy as you might expect, given that the chassis is only slightly shorter than a bendy bus.</p> <p>The limousine length may look a little awkward, like one of those people whose height goes beyond imposing into the more absurdist realm of unnecessary, yet it makes for a spacious interior. And not just for the driver. A fully-grown adult could sit in the back on a long journey without fear of deep-vein thrombosis - something that can be said of very few cars in my six-foot-two-inch experience.</p> <p>The true mark of this model, however, is that it is a hybrid. Not the kind that runs on petrol and wind power or yogurt. This is an altogether more revolutionary concept: half saloon and half hatchback. The boot looks like a normal saloon boot. But don't be fooled. There's a Batman button that transforms it into a full rear opening. OK, it's a facility that, strictly speaking, doesn't qualify as superb, but it is useful. The Skoda Useful?

  "<p>The other day, I ordered an \"atheist\" T-shirt for my husband, James. He is as scathing about organised religion as only a former Catholic can be: the air rings with words such as \"medieval superstitious claptrap\" when the subject comes up. Our bookshelves groan under the weight of Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens. His adult life has been a rebellion against the religion that made him rack his brains for things to confess when he was seven. His current aim is to ride on a bus bearing the atheist advertising campaign - I can imagine him making a special trip to London, hanging around on a corner until one comes along.</p> <p>Together, we live a happily secular existence. Our wedding was conducted by a registrar in a fort in Cornwall and our three children have not been christened. I once played Mary in the school nativity play but these days I see Christmas as the traditional midwinter festival and have done enough research into the co-opting of existing celebrations by Christianity to justify celebrating it. Similarly, Easter is a spring festival of renewal, rebirth and chocolate, rather than anything more harrowing. </p> <p>I am, however, always happy to go to church for a special occasion, when we are invited to support friends and family. The special occasions have included weddings, funerals and baptisms. This summer, we added a new event to the list: we went to Wells cathedral to celebrate my mother's ordination. </p> <p>Last year, for the first time, more women than men were ordained by the Church of England. About 400 women have been ordained so far, and their ranks are swelling by the year. The days when reactionaries scuttled off to Catholicism in protest at the shocking news that women were to climb the pulpit steps - let loose on something more meaty than flower arrangements and coffee mornings - seem a long way behind us. Despite my lack of interest in all matters religious, I was delighted, in 1994, when the General Synod finally agreed on the ordination of women. I remember having a heartfelt argument with a man at a party who kept repeating, \"I can't explain, it just isn't right,\" on the night of the vote. </p> <p>All the same, I never imagined for a moment that my mother would be joining the ranks of women in dog collars. If I had known, I would have been perplexed in the extreme. </p> <p>As we sat in the 12th-century cathedral, breathing in the musty smell of damp stone and hymn books, I looked at James and smiled. He grinned back: the whole scenario was so unlikely. The cathedral was packed as 11 people, four of them women, were being ordained and all had brought supporters. The atmosphere was friendly, excited; there was a great sense of occasion. We were welcomed by the Bishop of Bath and Wells. Our children were in the creche, making stained-glass windows from paper, and the rest of the family were sitting on pews, trying not to look like heathens. Many of the people who didn't go up for holy communion during the service belonged to my poor mother.</p> <p>Then we saw her: my mother, in a cassock and dog collar. She stood in a line with the other ordinands and we watched with amazement and pride as she became a member of the clergy. </p> <p>Through my childhood, there was little to suggest that one day I would become a vicar's daughter. (The vicar's daughters I knew were, like convent girls, wicked in a very particular way, and I was rather jealous of their status.) I had the standard liberal agnostic upbringing - my mother's journey to the church was a gradual one. As a classical musician and someone with a fondness for grand architecture, she was often to be found in church choirs, generally training them. I remember the children's choir assembling in our sitting room, on Thursdays after school, being coaxed through The King of Love My Shepherd Is and All Things Bright and Beautiful. A wardrobe mistress from the local theatre made us blue and white cassocks and we often earned tubes of Smarties by singing the aforementioned hymns at weddings.</p> <p>Perhaps I should have realised something was afoot when Mum was the only person in the family who enjoyed watching the Vicar of Dibley. When she and Nigel, my stepfather, moved to Long Ashton, near Bristol, they set up a choir at the church. I took Gabe, my firstborn, along on Christmas Day when he was 15 months old and was surprised that nobody minded when he yelled \"Tree!\" in delight during a quiet moment (he had finally noticed the 10ft Christmas tree). When Seb, my second son, was born, we were invited to tea at the vicarage so that Mum could show off her new grandson. Then it cranked up a notch. Mum was suddenly doing an MA in Christian spirituality. Then she applied for the vicars' course and spent three years working extremely hard at it. Now she is a very busy deacon in Somerset.</p> <p>Our children used to say, \"Oh look, a castle,\" when they noticed a church. We lived in France, where the state school system is secular and religion had no more place in their lives than it did in ours. There were no nativity plays for them, though they had a vague idea that Christmas was connected with a particular baby (there was once a Yuletide confusion in the supermarket between Babybel cheeses and the baby Jesus that made me cry with laughter, to the bafflement of all around). Occasionally, we would wander into a church to admire the architecture and they loved putting a euro in the slot and lighting a candle. They knew that God was something you could believe in if you wanted to, but were also certain that they didn't. </p> <p>When we went to Mum's ordination, two-year-old Lottie called the cathedral \"Granny's Castle\", and for a while afterwards would point out churches and say, \"Granny live there.\" A few weeks later, we moved back to Britain and settled in Cornwall. In September, the boys started at a new school. It is a wonderful environment where they are outrageously happy. Compared with this one, the village school in France, with its ultra-traditional teaching methods and bare classrooms, looks joyless and Victorian. St Francis is the school in our town that felt right for us. It is also a Church of England school. \"At school,\" Seb said, after his second day in reception, \"we have to do this,\" and he put his hands together in prayer and closed his eyes, looking briefly angelic. \"I don't know what it's for.\"</p> <p>Gabe joined in. \"Yes, we do,\" he agreed, \"and I don't know what it's for, either.\" Seb, who is four, is now fascinated by the idea of God. \"He could be sitting right there,\" he says, pointing at an empty chair, \"because God's invisible!\" God, at the moment, is a kind of superheroic imaginary friend (which, arguably, is religion in a nutshell). </p> <p>Our prejudices about the church have started to melt away as, in spite of everything, it becomes a fixture in our family life. The more I see the way my mother lives, the more respect I have for it. The three-year course she did was gruelling and she got to study New Testament Greek and all sorts of interesting things. She has worked as a chaplain at a children's hospice and supported families through experiences that I, as a parent, shy away from even imagining. She conducts harvest festivals and funerals, runs a choir (as ever) and supports anyone who needs it, without judging them. </p> <p>She is still my liberal, accepting mother and has not magically developed a set of prejudices. The headteacher of the boys' school is the same. So I began to see that it is possible to have the church as a pillar of your life without being unbearably smug and without being the kind of blinkered evangelist who explains the existence of dinosaur fossils in a biblical 6,000-year-old earth as \"God playing a joke on us\", which was the desperate suggestion made by an American I once met. It is, it turns out, possible to be within the church and to see much of the Bible as metaphor. </p> <p>Now the Synod has voted to allow women to train as bishops, and this will be confirmed in February next year. It seems inevitable that the priesthood will soon be dominated by women, and ridiculous that there are still people out there who think this is in any way a bad thing.</p> <p>And so, while I have been too involved with my three children to be paying attention, my mother has been quietly smashing down centuries of barriers every time she goes to work. She is a woman in a traditionally male profession, showing up the hundreds of years of sexism for what it was. It is impossible to do anything other than celebrate that; impossible not to be fiercely proud of her. </p> <p>I know I will never believe in God. To me, Christianity will always seem to be a tradition rooted in times when people believed the Earth was flat, the stars pinholes to heaven. But at Christmas I will take the children to church to support my mother. James will probably skulk at home in his atheist T-shirt. </p> <p>He is still prone to asking Mum, \"Are you taking mass, Bridget?\" because to him church will always mean Catholicism. And, after the service, the skulking, the plastic babies and 10ft trees, the house will be full of Lego and Doctor Who toys, overexcited children and too much food. It is, essentially, business as usual.</p> <p>\u2022 Emily Barr's latest novel, The Sisterhood, is published by Headline Review at \u00a36.99.</p>",
  "<h2>You're in a money purchase scheme</h2> <p>There are nearly four million workers in Britain with company pension schemes that rely entirely on the stock market. As the FTSE has plummeted, their hopes of a comfortable retirement have receded fast. Unfortunately I'm one of them. </p> <p>These are the so-called \"money purchase\" or \"defined contribution\" (DC) schemes which have replaced final salary pensions at hundreds of companies across the UK. Instead of the company promising you a portion of your final salary at retirement - they hate that, it's too expensive - you and the company pay into a scheme. Each month you pay in around 5% of your salary, while the company - if you're lucky - puts in a similar amount. The money's invested on the stock market and at retirement whatever you've built up is turned into an income. </p> <p>But what does this mean in practice? Have you and I really lost all this money? What sort of pension will I receive now? And precisely what can I and anybody else in a DC scheme do to repair the situation? </p> <p>This week, rather gingerly, I delved into my own pension at the Guardian. It's a standard DC scheme, managed by Legal &amp; General, with 85% of the money invested in stock market-listed shares. So how badly has the credit crunch hit home? </p> <p>In April 2007, my fund was worth \u00a375,304. Twelve months later it stood at \u00a380,720 - which seems good, until you factor in the \u00a38,918 the company and I paid in contributions during the period. Since then it has gone from just bad to plain awful. Last week the fund value stood at \u00a366,267 - and that's after paying in a further \u00a34,500. </p> <p>If I'd just put the money and contributions in the cash fund in April 2007, it would today be worth around \u00a390,000. In other words, the stock market fall has cost me close to \u00a325,000. </p> <p>I'm struggling here to find some good news, but one positive is that finding out about your DC scheme is easier than you might think. You can get an up-to-date valuation and a projection figure simply by calling or emailing your pensions department. </p> <p>Want to change where your money is invested? Again, it takes little more than downloading a form and sending it to your pension department. </p> <p>Virtually all DC schemes offer a choice of funds in which you can invest, mostly equity but also bond, gilts and cash options. Most people, understandably terrified by pensions, accept a company's \"default\" option. Typically, this puts you into a fund which is 80%-90% invested in shares until 10 years before retirement, at which point the fund starts shifting into cash and bonds to avoid the risk of a precipitous fall in markets just before retirement. </p> <p>If I'd had the foresight to switch into cash back in April 2007, a few minutes spent filling in a form would have saved me \u00a325,000. But does anybody really do this? The Guardian's pension department told me the overwhelming number of employees are, like workers at other companies, in the default option. But plenty of people - especially those above 50 and with more financial nous than others - do take control. </p> <p>Sure enough, I found them in the Guardian's City department. One reporter, now in his 50s, and with a large fund built up over many years of service, switched the whole lot into cash in March 2007. He reckons he has saved close to \u00a3100,000 - and says it took just a few minutes to do. \"I decided to do it after losing more in my pension between 2001-2003 than I earned from working. It taught me to watch my pension more closely,\" he told me. </p> <p>Is he going to put the money back into equities? For now, at least, he's happy to leave it in the cash fund. </p> <p>The rest of us would love to turn the clock back and do the same, but that's one option your pension department won't allow. The best alternative is to investigate additional voluntary contributions as a way to top up your pension. You choose to pay in extra amounts each month, tax free, from your monthly pay. Many companies will also top up contributions as well.</p> <p>For example, it costs a higher rate taxpayer just \u00a360 a month to see an extra \u00a3150 a month go into their pension if, as in the Guardian's case, the company chips in 50p for every \u00a31 extra paid by an employee. For what it's worth, I'll now be increasing my AVCs substantially. </p> <p>And before anyone thinks, hey, Collinson's not doing that badly, he's got \u00a366,000 in his pension, think again. The worst drawback of DC schemes is that you need to build up colossal sums if you have any hope of enjoying a decent income in retirement. A pot of \u00a366,000 pays an income for a single male at 65 of just \u00a3249 a month. That'll cover the council tax, then. </p> <p>My father's generation retired on pensions worth two-thirds of their final salary. Like most people in DC schemes, even if I pile in contributions for the next two decades, I'll retire on roughly 20% of my final salary.</p> <p>See you down at B&amp;Q. I'll be behind the counter.</p> <h2> You're in a final salary scheme?</h2> <p>There are nearly nine million people in Britain in top quality \"final salary\" based pensions. But are even these schemes safe from the global financial storm? </p> <p>Final salary schemes guarantee a pension according to the number of years you work for a company. Work for 40 years at the same employer and you can collect a pension worth two-thirds of your last salary. </p> <p>The good news is that even if a company goes bust, members are looked after by the Pension Protection Fund. If you are retired, the PPF guarantees 100% of your pension payments. </p> <p>If you are still working, it pays out 90%, up to a maximum of \u00a327,770 a year. But this is no time for complacency. Cash-strapped companies are increasingly desperate to limit their own liabilities. Recent action includes demanding that non-contributory members begin to pay, usually at least 5% a of salary every month; raising existing members; putting a bar on future \"accrual\" into the scheme; and basing the pension not on the final salary but on the lower \"career average\" salary instead.</p> <p>Annual pay rises for pensioners, linked to inflation, may also be withdrawn. It will be down to what individual contracts specify. </p> <p>Attractive \"accrual rates\" are also under pressure. A good scheme has a 1/60th rate. That means for every year you work, you receive entitlement to 1/60th of your final salary. </p> <p>After 40 years, you are at 40/60ths and earn a pension worth 2/3rds of your final salary. Many public sector schemes are on a 1/80th basis. </p> <p>About the best way to secure a good pension is to become an MP; their accrual rate is 1/40th - so they have to work just 26 years to be able to retire on two-thirds of final salary (currently \u00a361,820). </p> <p>The next best thing is to buy \"added years\" if you have not worked the maximum number of years at the company. Typically, you'll receive one extra year's \"service\" for a lump sum paid into the fund; how much this costs depends on your age, salary and how long you've been there </p> <p>Staff working for privately-owned companies don't usually have any limit to the number of years they can add, but many public sector pensions typically allow just five years extra. </p> <p>Despite the mass closure of final salary schemes to new members, there are a few still open to new joiners. </p> <p>It's one of the big attractions of getting a job at John Lewis Partnership: you have to wait for three years to join, but it's non-contributory scheme and the company says it's a major source of staff loyalty.</p> <h2>You're not in a pension scheme?</h2> <p>Worried about your financial future, but you earn less than average pay and are already in your 40s or 50s? Don't bother saving \u2014 go down the pub instead.</p> <p>Critics of Britain's fiendishly complex tax and benefi ts system say even saving as much as \u00a325,000 is hardly worth it, as the state will simply reduce your benefits nearly pound-for-pound when you retire. The current basic state pension is low: just \u00a390.70 a week. But assuming you have made enough National Insurance contributions, you will also receive a second state pension which can typically add a further \u00a340 a week.</p> <p>Even if you have a patchy NI payments history, you are automatically <br>entitled to Pension Credit, which takes a retired person's weekly income up to \u00a3124 (\u00a3189 for a couple). On top of that, housing benefit and council tax benefit can boost a pensioner's income. </p> <p>These benefits are by no means generous \u2014 around six in 10 Britons do not have towards retirement and will be totally dependent on state benefits. Anyone who wants to be guaranteed an income in retirement much above \u00a3150 a week will have to save either privately or through a company scheme.</p> <p>But unless you can save enough to generate an income that replaces those lost benefits, you could effectively be throwing money into a pot from which you'll ultimately see little benefit. \"Clearly someone in their 50s living on a low income, with a patchy work record and no savings is going to struggle to make up enough ground to see any real benefi t,\" says pensions expert Steve Bee of Scottish Life.</p> <p>The trouble is it is very difficult to say definitively what level of saving is<br>worthwhile . When you apply for pension credit, the government makes a calculation in which it looks at all of your incomes (from things such as company pensions) and all of your savings (from Isas to premium bonds and shares) and if they are above a certain limit, you don't qualify.</p> <p>But here comes the fiendishly complicated bit: the government doesn't recognise savings as merely the interest on your building society account. Instead it counts all your capital from all sources and for every \u00a3500 you have above \u00a36,000, it translates that as \u00a31 a week of income. And if you have a high \"income\" on this basis, bang goes your pension credit.</p> <p>Are you still with us? What it means is that if you have saved a lot, it counts against your pension credit. A total savings pot of \u00a325,000 translates into \u00a350 a week in \"income\" . Add this putative \u00a350 a week to a couple's \u00a3145 basic state pension, and they'll be above the \u00a3190 a week level at which pension credit runs out. This suggests that it's right to save \u00a36,000, as this won't affect your benefits. But if you save above that and as much as \u00a325,000, it is likely to be lost, partially or wholly, in reductions in benefits.</p> <p>Let's take the example of a lowincome person aged 50, who struggles to put aside \u00a3100 a month in savings. After 15 years that will add up to around \u00a325,900, assuming interest at 5%. The fi rst \u00a36,000 is safe, but above that there is limited benefit in saving more. The government says that its Pension Credit Savings Credit rewards those who have made a modest provision for their retirement with up to \u00a319.71 a week for single people and \u00a326.13 for couples. At current rates people with weekly incomes up to around \u00a3174 for single people and \u00a3255 for couples may still qualify for some savings credit.</p> <p>Pensions Minister Rosie Winterton says: \"It is vitally important that people save for their later life so they can enjoy their retirement. In the present climate people are tightening their belts and looking at their outgoings, but I would stress the importance of maintaining the saving habit now for the benefits it will bring 25 years down the line.\"</p> <p>But the choice over whether to save for your retirement will soon be out<br>of your hands. From 2012 all workers aged over 22 earning more than \u00a35,035 a year will be automatically enrolled into a company pension scheme or its new Personal Accounts, although they will retain the right to opt out. Individuals will have to contribute at least 4% of their salary. Companies must pay in at least 3% and the government will contribute a further 1%. Employers offering private schemes at least as good as the government's will be able to enrol their employees into these.</p> <p>Sadly, Personal Accounts system will suffer from the same savings-benefit trap. In a parliamentary question, Baroness Hollis of Heigham established from the DWP that if you earn less than \u00a320,000, and are less than 20 years from retirement, Personal Accounts will give you a limited lift in income.</p> <p>For more details, call the Pension Credit helpline on 0800 99 1234, open<br>8am to 8pm Monday to Friday.</p>",
  "<p>David Miliband, the foreign secretary, flew to the Democratic Republic of the Congo last night, as Britain joined a mounting diplomatic effort to end the interminable conflict in the east amid questions about the effectiveness of the UN peacekeeping mission there.</p> <p>Miliband will fly this morning from the capital, Kinshasa, to the stricken eastern town of Goma, as concerns grow about the plight of tens of thousands of people displaced by the latest bout of the conflict. </p> <p>He will proceed, with French counterpart Bernard Kouchner, to Rwanda as part of a mission to press as much as possible the Congolese and Rwandan governments to find a political solution to more than a decade of conflict that has claimed about 5 million lives, mostly from disease, and left more than one million as refugees.</p> <p>Kouchner asked Miliband to accompany him at short notice, and the foreign secretary agreed to go in the hope of maximising the pressure on all sides. \"The UK and France together really deliver Europe in Africa. It's a multiplier and it can deliver a serious message,\" a British official said.</p> <p>Rebel leader Laurent Nkunda has advanced to within 10 miles of Goma, uprooting tens of thousands of people. </p> <p>Nkunda says he is fighting to protect his Tutsi community from attack by Hutu rebels from Rwanda. Government forces have fled. Yesterday, there were reports that camps sheltering 50,000 displaced people had been burned.</p> <p>The EU is considering sending forces to the area, and the UN is appealing for more troops for what is already the largest peacekeeping force in the world. </p> <p>But the visits come amid concern that the UN force is fighting a war that government forces are no longer prepared to fight, and in doing so is siding with extremist Hutus responsible for the genocide in neighbouring Rwanda.</p> <p>Critics of the UN operation, and some of its own staff, say the mission is complicating efforts to reach a peace settlement because instead of pressing for the disarmament of all major rebel groups, the UN has in effect taken sides against Nkunda, on behalf of a government whose forces are deeply implicated in human rights abuses and more interested in making money from gold smuggling than fighting. The government's army is also allied with exiled Rwandan Hutu rebels.</p> <p>UN officials in Congo privately say they have been left by the major powers to do an impossible job because of lack of international political will to confront the causes of the conflict.</p> <p>As tens of thousands fled this week, people vented their anger at the UN's failure to fulfil its mandate of protecting civilian lives. Residents of Goma stoned UN compounds as Nkunda's forces marched on the town and government forces fled. An Indian officer was critically injured. </p> <p>The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said peacekeepers are \"doing everything possible to protect civilians and fulfil their mandate in untenable circumstances\". One UN official said untenable meant that peacekeepers were expected to fight when the government's army will not. </p> <p>Alan Doss, the UN envoy to Congo, said the peacekeepers have served with \"really great distinction\" but that there are not enough of them to protect the population. But critics say that more troops are not the answer because the UN has been given a role it cannot fulfil and has become deeply compromised as a result.</p> <p>Neil Campbell, a researcher for the International Crisis Group, who recently visited Goma, said it was not feasible to expect the UN to protect civilians outside of a few urban areas, given the size of eastern Congo and the array of armed groups.</p> <p>\"The UN has been projected as the body that's going to bring democracy and stabilisation to the north-east of Congo, which is completely unrealistic,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The problem is the UN has been forced into fighting by the disintegration of the [government's] army. When I was in Goma, the sense of a lack of discipline and any kind of military cohesion within the armed forces is incredible ... The armed forces have been running away from the rebels, so the UN has been forced into a role that it wasn't supposed to be taking.\"</p> <p>The UN has concentrated on trying to prevent the various rebel groups from taking over major towns. In doing so, it has been drawn in on one side of the conflict on the grounds that it was defending a democratic government in Kinshasa.</p> <p>But that role was compromised because government forces were often responsible for human rights abuses, including murder and rape, and are involved in making money from illegal mining operations. </p> <p>Global Witness recently accused sections of the Congolese army of mining gold and tin in league with the Rwandan Hutu rebel group the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), whose leaders are implicated in the 1994 genocide.</p> <p>Some UN peacekeepers have also been accused of involvement in the illegal mining trade and gold smuggling.</p> <p>Congo's president, Laurent Kabila, has also been protecting the FDLR because its forces have proved more willing to fight than his own troops. Campbell said the scramble for control of mines remains a driving force behind the conflict.</p> <p>\"Everyone is gaining something from the North Kivu crisis,\" he said. \"Nkunda presents himself as being the protector of the Tutsis in North Kivu. He's nothing of the sort. He's not a freedom fighter, his primary goals are economic and political.\"</p>",
  "<p>Britain is heading for a more bruising start to the recession than it experienced during the last big downturn under John Major in the early 1990s, an economic thinktank warned yesterday.</p> <p>Gordon Brown claims Britain is better placed to weather the downturn than it was under the Tories in the early 1990s, but the Institute for Fiscal Studies said that the public finances are deteriorating sharply.</p> <p>As shadow chancellor George Osborne warned that Labour's plans to increase spending will fire a \"cruise missile\" at the heart of the economy, the IFS said that Britain's structural budget deficit was deteriorating \"more sharply\" than in the early phase of the 1990-91 recession. </p> <p>The structural budget deficit is the shortfall between government revenue and spending. The IFS estimates that the deficit will be 3.6% of national income this year, compared with 2.6% at the same stage 18 years ago. </p> <p>The prime minister says that Britain is better placed to withstand the global recession because Labour has ended \"Tory boom and bust\". Brown has said that Britain is in a stronger position because of his decision to grant independence to the Bank of England in setting interest rates, a move that has tackled inflation. Brown also says he has created millions of jobs.</p> <p>But the IFS warned that Britain is facing a bumpier ride this time. It said the sharp deterioration in the structural deficit \"largely reflects the impact of the credit crunch and the falls in stock and housing markets, rather than budget decisions\".</p> <p>The report came as the Tories made clear that they would not support any increase in government spending beyond the \"automatic fiscal stabilisers\" which kick in during a recession. These guarantee that funding for areas like welfare payments, which increase in a downturn, is maintained as tax receipts decline. The government has hinted that it may increase, or simply bring forward, capital expenditure to kickstart the economy which is shrinking by 0.5%.</p> <p>Osborne rejected this out of hand. In a speech to the London School of Economics, the shadow chancellor said: \"Even a modest dose of Keynesian spending - say increasing it by an additional 1% of GDP - means that in the end taxes will have to rise by the equivalent of almost 4p on income tax. </p> <p>\"That's not just a tax bombshell, it's a cruise missile aimed at the heart of a recovery. And in extremis, it can mean you lose the confidence of the international markets. Gordon Brown doesn't understand that there are limits to borrowing, even after he's abandoned his fiscal rules.\"</p> <p>Osborne said that Brown's approach to the economy, relying on an \"irresponsible\" fiscal policy of funding government spending through increased borrowing, had gravely harmed the economy. He said the proper response to a recession - to allow monetary policy to \"do the heavy lifting\" by lowering interest rates, was now difficult. \"Instead of using monetary policy to manage demand, an unsustainable debt-fuelled bubble was allowed to develop. And instead of fiscal responsibility, reckless government borrowing meant that fiscal policy proved totally unsustainable as soon as the bubble burst.\"</p> <p>Brown will take heart from some elements of the IFS report. It says that Labour has used more of its borrowing to finance capital investment, rather than current spending as the Conservatives did. </p> <p>Both Labour and the Tories entered recessions in their 12th year in office and both allowed their budget balances to slip into the red after a good start.</p>",
  "<p>When <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/englandrugbyleagueteam\">England</a> face <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/australiarugbyleague\">Australia</a> in their first defining challenge of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/rugbyleagueworldcup2008\">World Cup</a> tomorrow, the coach, Tony Smith, will be employing some very unorthodox thinking. He will relay messages to the players through a management consultant who previously worked as a human resources director for Unilever.</p> <p>Damian Hughes's varied CV also includes a couple of brief encounters with Brian Clough as a schoolboy trainee with Nottingham Forest, five years on the junior coaching staff at Manchester United, a classics degree from Leeds University, helping his dad to keep Mancunian youth on the straight and narrow at the Collyhurst and Moston Lads Club - Brian Hughes was awarded the MBE in 2000 for his services to boxing, which included coaching Robin Reid to a world title - and publishing three books on organisational psychology.</p> <p>That is a suitably unorthodox background for a ground-breaking rugby league appointment, which follows the trail blazed by Sir Clive Woodward who described the round-the-world yachtsman turned motivational guru Humphrey Walters as a key figure behind England's World Cup success in Australia in the other rugby code five years ago.</p> <p>The brief of Hughes, pictured right, is both straightforward and daunting: instilling a belief in the England players that they can end Australia's long dominance of international rugby league.</p> <p>\"It's taken a lot of courage on Tony's part to bring somebody like me in,\" said the 35-year-old, who addressed the players in a team meeting in their Melbourne hotel on the bank of the Yarra last night. \"The orthodox thing is to ask how many caps you've won and stuff like that.</p> <p>\"But when you're at the level these guys are, talent equals itself out. Physically there's very little different, and tactically, Tony's a world-class coach. So it comes down to mentality and how you deal with pressure and change and issues like that. That's what might make the difference in this World Cup.</p> <p>\"The pressure on the players does become more intense. The other night we went to a reception in Melbourne which was supposed to be a celebration of 100 years of England playing Australia, but the videos they showed were of about 50 Australian tries, and then some fleeting footage of us being successful before 1963.</p> <p>\"The good thing was the players were all aware of it and as we came away they laughed about it. It was just another example of them trying to convince us that we've got no chance, and that they're superior. It's important to be aware of that and be prepared for it.\"</p> <p>Hughes's connection with Smith goes back to a chance encounter with the Leeds captain and England loose forward Kevin Sinfield during a sports discussion progamme hosted by the late Tony Wilson on BBC Radio Manchester three years ago.</p> <p>\"Kevin invited me to come and see Tony, and we just hit it off straight away,\" Hughes explained. \"When he got the England job he gave me a role as coaching consultant. Rather than impose standards on the players we allowed them to have control, and they imposed on themselves a more stringent set of standards than any of the coaches would have done.</p> <p>\"They are a very impressive bunch. With the boxing and when I was coaching at United I've been around a rarefied atmosphere, and seen the sacrifices that are required. I've seen it in business too and this lot are as good as any I've seen.\"</p> <p>They were not overly impressive in beating Papua New Guinea 32-22 in their opening World Cup game in Townsville last Saturday, making an improved performance against Australia tomorrow imperative for their credibility even though both teams are almost certain to make the semi-finals whatever the result.</p> <p>But Hughes stresses that they are working to a five-week plan. \"It's not where you start, it's how you finish. In rugby union, can you remember who England played in their first few games when they won the World Cup? The focus is on who we play on November 22 and this is just a step along the way.\"</p> <p><strong>England:</strong> <strong>Wellens</strong>; <strong>Gardner</strong> both St Helens, <strong>Gleeson</strong> Warrington, <strong>Senior</strong> Leeds, <strong>Calderwood</strong> Wigan; <strong>Pryce</strong> St Helens, <strong>Burrow</strong> Leeds; <strong>Peacock</strong> Leeds, capt, <strong>Roby</strong>, <strong>Graham</strong> both St Helens, <strong>Hock</strong> Wigan, <strong>Ellis</strong>, <strong>Sinfield</strong> both Leeds. <strong>Interchange:</strong> <strong>McGuire</strong> Leeds, <strong>Morley</strong> Warrington, <strong>Fa'asavalu</strong>, <strong>Wilkin </strong>both St Helens.</p> <p><strong>Australia:</strong> <strong>Slater</strong> Melbourne; <strong>Monaghan</strong> Canberra, <strong>Inglis</strong>, <strong>Folau</strong> both Melbourne, <strong>Tate</strong> NZ Warriors; <strong>Lockyer</strong> Brisbane, capt, <strong>Thurston</strong> North Queensland; <strong>Civoniceva</strong> Penrith, <strong>Smith</strong> Melbourne, <strong>Price</strong> NZ Warriors, <strong>Stewart</strong> Manly, <strong>Laffranchi</strong> Gold Coast, <strong>Gallen</strong> Cronulla. </p> <p><strong>Interchange:</strong> <strong>Kite</strong>, <strong>Perry</strong> Manly, <strong>Tupou</strong> Sydney Roosters, <strong>Hunt</strong> Brisbane.</p> <p><strong>Referee </strong>Tony Archer (Aus).</p> <h2>Green and golden rules</h2> <p>Five reasons why Australia have dominated rugby league for so long.</p> <p><strong>Playing numbers</strong></p> <p>League is the most popular football code in New South Wales and Queensland, so it has tended to have first pick of talent.</p> <p><strong>League clubs</strong></p> <p>The wealth of the Sydney teams was down to the social clubs alongside them, which in many cases became huge entertainment complexes.</p> <p><strong>Training methods</strong></p> <p>In the late-70s coaches like Jack Gibson and Terry Fearnley looked to the NFL to develop new techniques, helping to produce a new generation of athletes far superior to Great Britain's.</p> <p><strong>State of Origin</strong></p> <p>The introduction of the ferocious battles between Queensland and New South Wales in 1980 provided a level of competition far more intense than anything in England.</p> <p><strong>Darren Lockyer</strong></p> <p>Whenever Great Britain have gone close to ending Australia's supremacy in recent years, the Brisbane Broncos stand-off has responded to the challenge.</p>",
  "<p>The website at the centre of controversy over racist abuse of British formula one driver Lewis Hamilton is owned by a New York-based advertising agency, TWBA, which is part of the world's largest media services group, Omnicom, the Guardian can reveal.</p> <p>The site belongs to the Spanish branch of the advertising firm. It was closed down last night after hundreds of abusive messages were posted, some of which referred to Hamilton as a \"half-breed\" and others which used the n-word. He hopes to become youngest ever world champion at the final race of the season tomorrow.</p> <p>Last night cabinet minister Andy Burnham led calls for action against the abuse. TBWA operates in 77 countries with 12,000 staff in 258 offices. Its clients include Absolut Vodka, Apple, Adidas, McDonald's, Michelin, Sony PlayStation, and Singapore Airlines. Last year, Omnicom's revenue was $12.7bn.</p> <p>A spokesman in the New York office said it did not know why the site, designed and owned by its interactive marketing branch in Spain, had not been monitored to stop racists using it to abuse Hamilton.</p> <p>Among comments on the site was someone calling himself Carillo, telling Hamilton: \"Kill yourself in your car.\" A message from Alberto says: \"I hope you run over your dad in the first pitstop, Hamilton.\"</p> <p>\"This is not what we condone as a company,\" said TBWA spokesman Jeremy Miller; it would take \"appropriate action\" once it identified who was responsible for the website.</p> <p>Renault's Fernando Alonso last night condemned the racist supporters. \"If it's true, obviously this is not possible [acceptable],\" the Spaniard told reporters at the Brazilian Grand Prix. \"In 2008 we cannot have these kind of people in our world. It's not only formula one, not only sport, it's normal life as well.\" </p> <p>Burnham, the culture, media and sport secretary, said: \"This is a crucial race and the whole country will be behind him. I'm very concerned to hear reports of sites potentially fuelling racist abuse. The authorities must take the toughest possible action against racism in sport.\" </p> <p>Keith Vaz, chairman of Labour's ethnic minority taskforce, urged foreign secretary David Miliband to lodge a formal protest, saying it was clear the site - Pincha la Rueda de Hamilton, or Burst Hamilton's Tyre - was set up to destabilise the driver. \"The Spanish government cannot allow this organised and systematic racism to continue. These people must be widely condemned and the websites they use shut down immediately.\"</p> <p>The sport's governing body, the FIA, and Hamilton's McLaren team condemned the attacks as \"abusive and hateful\".</p>",
  "<p>Every United States presidential election is important. Most of them provide dramatic political theatre. All of them are compulsively watched by the rest of the world. The election of 2008, however, is a record-breaker in all departments. It is important because it comes at the end of George Bush's calamitous two terms and amid such economic turmoil. It is memorable because it has involved so many ground-breaking candidates and long campaigns on both sides. And it has been watched and experienced by the world as no American election has been before. Not since the Kennedy era has such a contest resonated so potently with so many people in America and beyond, including in this country. But the circumstances of this year's contest, the character of the protagonists and the immediacy of the internet age combine to mean that the 2008 election is likely to make a defining statement about America for this global generation that may eclipse even the impact of the contest of 1960.</p> <p><strong>World interest</strong></p> <p>Though we lack the vote, this is our election too. Such statements outrage many Americans and inspire others. But the rest of the world has not just lived this election. Our life chances and societies will also be shaped by what happens next Tuesday. The world has an interest in the outcome because, in spite of everything, America remains the world's pre-eminent military, political, financial and cultural power. America's standing in the world has been damaged during the Bush years. He has inflicted massive direct harm to many parts of the world through his military actions, has set back the quality of life on our planet by his indifference to climate change, international cooperation and the rule of law. He has been anti-Americanism's best recruiting sergeant and al-Qaida's too.</p> <p>The world may not have the vote on Tuesday. But it certainly has a candidate. That candidate is Senator Barack Obama. If the world could vote on November 4, Mr Obama would win by a landslide. Polling shows him preferred in Egypt by two to one, in Poland by three to one, in Canada by five to one, in Brazil by six to one, in Britain by seven to one, in France by 11 to one and in Kenya by more than 17 to one. </p> <p>He is not just the preferred choice of liberal Europeans. He is also the choice of the rest of the world, of all races and creeds - and of young people in particular. No buses crammed with lawyers would be needed to validate the accuracy of these votes. He commands this support, not only because he is not George Bush but because he personifies so much of what the world still admires about America. Americans ought to think about that. The world longs, perhaps unrealistically but palpably nevertheless, for a new America. Only Mr Obama can provide that.</p> <p>John McCain manifestly would not do this. Eight years ago, Mr McCain offered himself as a punchy and principled alternative to Mr Bush. The McCain of 2008 has been very different. He has made too many compromises with the social conservative wing of his party and in the last few weeks has run a partisan campaign in an attempt to re-energise the Republican faithful. His response to the economic crisis triggered by the credit crunch and the collapse of Lehman Brothers has been parlous. His party faces a bitter and enduring self-examination if it loses next week.</p> <p>By choosing Sarah Palin as his running mate, he made a huge error of both tactical and strategic judgment. Mrs Palin may have entranced the celebrity-driven parts of the media, but she has relentlessly alienated American voters, nearly 60% of whom now believe that she is not qualified to be the nation's vice-president. Mr McCain has made much of his experience and readiness to lead, but in this campaign he has been found lamentably wanting. </p> <p>When the 2008 campaign began, Mr Obama stood for two things. He was against the Iraq war and he was in favour of a break with the embattled partisan politics of America's recent past. He was the candidate offering hope and change. He is still all those things today, but he has become much more than that. Over the past 20 months he has been tested in debate, in campaigning skills, and on policy. At each turn he has responded with enviable coolness and clarity of judgment and language, while developing a detailed programme of commitments on the issues that would shape his presidency - healthcare, economic restoration, the federal budget, energy and Iraq.</p> <p>His performance in the televised debates was formidable, showcasing the discipline that has been such a feature of his campaign. He has responded well to the financial crisis, after a cautious start. In his 30-minute campaign infomercial this week, he reiterated the key pledges that he has made throughout this campaign, with a radical sustainable energy programme as a hallmark. Attacked by the Republicans as a redistributionist and a socialist, he has held his ground, insisting that America needs to be a fairer society. </p> <p><strong>High expectations</strong></p> <p>The voters may give the Democrats a clean sweep in Congress and the White House next week. Expectations will be high, hard to manage, and the honeymoon may not last. Yet Mr Obama will be in an enviable position. He will have the political space to write a new chapter for centre-left American governance. His election would mark the end of the conservative era that began under Ronald Reagan and which so inhibited the Democrats of the 1980s and 90s. His race is part of his appeal, and if he is elected it will mark a historic moment in American public life. But it is not, in the end, the central question next week. Mr Obama's greatest achievement is to have seized on the failures of the Republican era and to have developed a serious new progressive coalition and programme. America stands on the threshold of a new era. That is what the nation needs and the world craves, and Americans should elect Barack Obama as their president.</p>",
  "<p>New Labour thrived on good times and bull markets. The culture of easy credit and consumerism disguised its evasions of class and power. Now the markets are in freefall, and its ideological failings are brutally exposed. In the manors and town houses of the super-rich those who have brought about the calamity harbour their wealth. They are untouchable and unaccountable. Their tax havens are sacrosanct. Corfu reveals how our political elites, seduced by their opulence and power, do business with them. This is not just an economic crisis, it is a crisis of democracy.</p> <p>Collective political action and the power of citizenship have been traded in for the ownership society, in which all were assured a small piece of the capitalist dream. In reality it has led to economic bust. House prices are heading for a 35% decline, repossessions are climbing and 2 million homeowners will find themselves in negative equity. The jobseeker's allowance count rose last month to 939,900. By Christmas unemployment could hit 2 million. The celebrated property-owning democracy looks increasingly brittle.</p> <p>The stakes are high. Who will pay for this recession - capital or labour? The Labour party must reinvent itself for this battle. It did so in the 1990s; it can do so again by reconnecting to its traditional constituencies and creating new cross-class alliances. There are no easy solutions, but the goal is simple: a fundamental transfer of wealth and power back to the people. This will help stop the deflationary spiral and lay the foundations for a more just, sustainable and equal society in the future.</p> <p>We need urgent action to address the housing crisis, which is replicating that in banking. Private housebuilders ensured long-term price inflation and profits by banking land and maintaining excess demand for homes, and profitability rose as the state withdrew from social housing supply. The outcome has been barely 150,000 homes built per year. This year it will be half that, against a planned 250,000. Meanwhile, there are an extra 220,000 family units a year in need of housing. About 1.75 million are on allocation and transfer lists. This is market failure on a grand scale.</p> <p>Yet the government colluded in this social disaster. Undersupply ensured inflation and speculation fuelled the good times. But now, as prices fall, there are unprecedented levels of personal debt while toxic mortgage-backed credit derivatives menace the financial system.</p> <p>Building firms are teetering on the brink, as land bank values collapse and cancellation rates hit 40%. The state must step in with an emergency public-sector housebuilding strategy, and if necessary, take a stake in some housebuilders to revive the sector. Local government must be re-empowered to fill the space vacated by the private sector.</p> <p>The relationship between market and state is being redrawn. Nowhere is this more needed than in housing. This is where the battle lines are being drawn up. The left must create a democratic and accountable state capable of strategic intervention in the domestic economy and creating global alliances. A new settlement means a progressive tax system, a restructured financial economy and a Green New Deal. Ahead lie the perils of global warming and peak oil. But now let us give homes to people, and with them the hope of a better life.</p> <p>Jon Cruddas is Labour MP for Dagenham; Jonathan Rutherford is editor of Soundings journal.

  "<h2>Margaret Drabble: The mood</h2> <p>What a lark! What a plunge! So thought Mrs Dalloway as she set off to Bond Street to buy flowers, and to my astonishment that's what I felt about the opening day of Westfield at White City. I went to mock and stayed to have fun. I've been predicting disaster for this enterprise during all the years it's been causing traffic jams, but now it's opened I forgive it, at least for the day. </p> <p>It was so easy to get there. The new underground station at Wood Lane is a three-minute journey from Ladbroke Grove, my nearest stop. I was still feeling cynical as the loudspeaker announced \"Exit here for a new shopping experience\", but there was something irresistibly cheerful about the mood of the crowd as it surged towards the glittering diamond-faceted grey-green palaces with their curving skyline. The sun was shining, and everybody was out on a spree. Indoors, the wide mall surged with a demotic flow of Londoners of all ages, shapes and colours, and dazzling sunlight poured through the roof. It was half-term, so there were family groups with small children and fleets of well turned-out infants in push chairs, but there were also gangs of teenagers, and some mysterious groups of smartly dressed young men with spiky hair. Armies of attendants with various badges were on guard, some of whom didn't know where anything was. But all of them were in a party mood. Nobody got cross, nobody was complaining. </p> <p>Had they all been at the free champagne? I overheard a man on his mobile shouting that it was \"just chaotic\", but it wasn't, really - a little boy weeping that he'd lost his mum was immediately rescued by two smiling policemen. The staff in all the outlets went out of their way to be upbeat, and I marvelled at the efficiency and good humour of the servers at Eat, where after two hours of trudging I queued for a delicious cup of Thai soup. How do they keep so politely cheerful, at that speed? The men's department at M&amp;S was quieter, and I received a lot of attention as I purchased some socks. A very handsome lad who took my money told me that \"to a man, this is just another shopping centre\". </p> <p>The architects as well as the sunshine may claim credit for the high spirits. Westfield is spacious and the marble finish looks good: the ceilings of the ladies' toilets are almost as lofty as those of the Palmer House Hilton in Chicago. A glimpse of a wall of formal greenery tempted me outdoors, and there I fell into conversation with a Guardian reader as we admired some vertical planting. She identified viola, trillium, ferns.</p> <p>Nobody knows whether this enterprise will flourish. First-day euphoria may give way to postnatal gloom. I was getting a little less chirpy myself when I decided to go home and couldn't easily find my way out. But I'm glad I went. As a display of Londoners, as a cavalcade of fellow citizens, this was a fine free show.</p> <h2>Toby Young: The place</h2> <p>Eight years ago, I remember reading a series of pieces in the press about the opening of the Bush Bar and Grill, a new restaurant on the Goldhawk Road. It was the first time anyone had attempted to launch a \"hot\" restaurant in W12 and there was some doubt as to whether such a bold venture could succeed. Would the locals have any interest in Mohitos and bok choi? Surely, the process of gentrification that had transformed W11 over the past quarter-century had ground to a halt at the Shepherd's Bush roundabout?</p> <p>The weird thing about Westfield is that those questions still haven't been resolved. Yes, the area has become more visibly middle-class, but it has been a slow process. Among the Bushoisie, as we jokingly call ourselves, there was jubilation when a multiplex finally opened opposite the tube, though it wasn't an unqualified blessing. It was the centrepiece of a brand-new shopping centre called W12 that was so desolate it looked like the one besieged by flesh-eating zombies in Dawn of the Dead.</p> <p>Now, all of a sudden, there's not merely another cinema complex in the area - there are flagship stores for Dior, Mont Blanc and Tiffany as well. There are 50 new restaurants, many of them more upmarket than the Bush Bar and Grill. How on earth did this happen? Walking around Westfield on Thursday afternoon - to the strains of Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet being played by a full-blown orchestra - it was as if I'd been teleported in to the 22nd century and given a glimpse of what Shepherd's Bush might look like when the gentrification process is complete. It left me feeling strangely disorientated. I went to bed in a ghetto and woke up in the middle of Bond Street.</p> <p> Actually, that's not quite accurate. The old Shepherd's Bush is still there. The owners of Westfield have promised to \"regenerate\" the Green, but for the time being it remains unchanged, with its flotsam of empty KFC boxes and discarded copies of London Lite. Various doom-mongers have predicted that Westfield will wipe out all the local shops - like a neutron bomb - but these people can't live in the area. Kensington High Street may suffer, but not the Uxbridge Road. It's a motley collection of pound shops, Polish delis, halal butchers, fast-food outlets and the occasional gem, such as Greenford Timber. It's a retail substrata that exists far below the luxury brands and high street names of Westfield. Even the other shopping centre in the area - George A Romero's W12 - will probably survive. There is nothing in the glamorous development opposite to rival the all-you-can eat \"Oriental\" buffet on the top floor.</p> <p>None of which means that Westfield will struggle to survive, obviously. Shepherd's Bush's small platoon of yummy mummies will probably push their Bugaboos along to the Early Learning Centre, but the vast majority of Westfield's customers will be from outside the area. This was apparent on Thursday, when over 100,000 visitors passed through its doors. It wasn't hard to spot the locals, wandering about in a somnambulistic daze, as thousands of energetic shoppers swarmed around them. Suddenly, they were tourists in their own back yard. Welcome to Mars.</p> <p>It is hard to know what effect this retail Valhalla will have on the long-term residents. Will we have to reconceptualise our sense of what it means to live in Shepherd's Bush? I suspect that things will carry on as they have before, with the process of embourgeoisement still proceeding at a snail's pace. The two worlds will sit side by side, scarcely aware of the other's existence, just as the white, middle-class churchgoers pass by the mosque on the Uxbridge Road on Sunday mornings without really noticing the Muslim worshippers. It's not the end of the world - just the emergence of yet another universe that will coexist alongside the others.</p> <h2>Jay Rayner: The food</h2> <p>I know I am supposed to hate Westfield's dining options; that I should mutter darkly about its airport aesthetic. I should sneer at the packaging of restaurant concepts and the victory of branding over flavour, and drench the shiny, curvy, wood-clad communal eating areas with a few bucketfuls of bile and spite.</p> <p>But I can't. The thing is, we have history, shopping mall dining and me. As a 10-year-old I used to love nothing more than to visit Brent Cross shopping centre, a bus ride from my north London home, and eat cream-splattered cheesecake beneath the building's glass dome. It was cheesecake! Eaten on a street! Which was inside! How cool was that? Very, I thought then, as I do now. </p> <p>All that said, I am a greedy man at cholesterol-drenched heart, and no amount of shiny marble is going to make me happy if the food is lousy. It isn't. There are nearly 50 outlets at Westfield, and they have been chosen with uncommon care and precision. In the main they are proof that the part of British restaurant sector which used to be the most dreary, the midmarket chain, has finally come of age. Outside, on the Southern Terrace, you'll find outposts of The Real Greek and the Gourmet Burger Kitchen, Thomasina Miers's much-liked Mexican place Wahaca and the classy pizzeria Fire and Stone, with others including a branch of the ethical, seasonal fast-food joint Leon to come. </p> <p>Back inside, sitting on what's called The Balcony are a dozen or more outlets - open kitchens around communal seating areas - which seem determined to raise the bar on this kind of catering. Some are familiar, many are new. There's dim sum from Bamboo Basket and falafel and tabouleh from Comptoir Libanais, there are Vietnamese specialities from Pho and Indian dishes from Tiffinbites.</p> <p>And yes, on the first day of trading, there are stupidities. Whoever thought it would be a good idea for Tossed, the salad company, to sell the \u00a3100 salad - Wagyu beef, truffles, pata negra ham - deserves to be made to eat undressed iceberg for a month. </p> <p>More intriguing is Croque Gascon, a quality fast-food outlet from the Michelin-starred chef Pascal Aussignac of Club Gascon. In between plating up heaps of duck rillettes and bayonne ham, he admitted they had been doubtful about the venture at first. But the Westfield people were good to work with and offered him an unbeatable deal. \"I'm glad to be here,\" he said, as the crowds surged around us. \"With a recession coming and people scared it's time to develop a new type of restaurant.\" But, he insists, it has to have proper food, including his \u00a37 duck hamburger (\u00a314 with a tranche of foie gras).</p> <p>That duck burger sums up the place. It's aspirational middle-class food for affluent middle-class people who are bored of \u00a350-a-head mediocrity. There's no McDonald's here, no KFC or Burger King. The nearest they come is a branch of Nandos and the grand daddy of all middle-class dining, Pizza Express. But both are tucked far out of view in what's called The Loft.</p> <p>On my way out I notice that the models in the window of lingerie retailer La Senza are rather more flesh and blood than usual. A woman stands in the window in silver leopardskin print pants and bra and nothing else. She is terribly blonde and terribly thin. She looks like she could do with a coat and a good meal. I can't help thinking that she's come to exactly the right place.</p> <h2>Annalisa Barbieri: The shops</h2> <p>This is a brave shopping centre and, unlike most commentators, I feel cheered that it has risen in a time of recession. </p> <p>But there is nothing brave about the shops here. In the whole centre, and I visited almost every store, I could count on the fingers of one hand the names I'd never heard of before. You want a Habitat, Gap, M&amp;S, Debenhams, Next, Monsoon, Smith's, Clinton cards, Orange shop, T-Mobile shop, Apple shop ... you get the picture ... you'll find them here. There's the quaintly named The Village, which is the posh bit: where Valentino, Prada, Miu Miu, De Beers, Louis Vuitton, Tiffany et al will be; those that were open (quite a few weren't, yet) were packed. But few people leaving the centre on its opening day were carrying shopping bags. This was, for the moment at least, a voyeuristic experience. I did purchase: some paracetamol from Boots (16p) - because almost every store seemed to have an in-house DJ and the smell of Christmas pot pourri and scented candles was overwhelming. A more helpful feature they could introduce would be to tell you the shape of the shopping centre - it's a figure of eight. A few people seemed to be in mild, orienteering panic (\"I don't want to venture too far in case we can't get back out\"). </p> <p>Who would come here and why? Obviously there's a lot of choice: 265 different shops, and you can walk around them without getting wet. But it made me miss Oxford Street, with its individual buildings, and the prospect of still being able to find some individualism. I wondered where I might buy a reel of cotton in this vast, glazed temple. Answer: nowhere.</p> <p>What would have been brave would have been to give some rent-reduced units to independents. I mean, I'm not stupid, I do understand that Westfield needs to make money. But that would have been so different. As it is, the real pull is not so much the number of outlets under one roof - because I still maintain Oxford Street and its environs offer more choice - but the parking: space for 4,500 cars, although even that is not free, nor even cheap at \u00a312 for up to seven hours.</p> <h2>Larry Elliott: The business</h2> <p>The figures from John Lewis yesterday were enough to send a shiver down the spine of retailers. Seen as the bellwether of the health of the high street, sales in the partnership's department stores were down a thumping 9.8% compared with a year earlier. Nor was this a one-off. Sales the previous week were down 7.6% and the week before that they were down 4.8%. </p> <p>The last six weeks have seen the greatest turmoil in the global financial system since the 1930s, and Britain is at the eye of the storm. The economy contracted by 0.5% in the three months ending September and there is more bad news to come. Gordon Brown and Mervyn King both agree that the economy is in recession; some City analysts believe that 2009 could see output fall by 1.5%.</p> <p>Add in rising unemployment, rapidly falling house prices and banks that have belatedly become a lot pickier when deciding whom to lend to, and it is clear that there were better times than late October 2008 to open a massive new shopping mall. During the course of 2008, 3m sq ft of new floor space has been added to Britain's retail sector - a period when the consumer has gone into hibernation. There is now a glut of retail space and it is a stone-cold certainty that 2009 will see a jump in business failures.</p> <p>That doesn't necessarily mean that Westfield itself will prove to be a colossal white elephant, because it has two things in its favour. The first is that shoppers will be attracted by its novelty, and footfall at the mall is bound to be high in the coming weeks. Whether the window-shopping translates into takings at the tills remains to be seen; the test is not the number of people milling about, it is whether they are carrying bags.</p> <p>The second advantage for Westfield that it is in London, where the boost from tourists attracted by the weaker pound has meant retailers have suffered less than in other parts of the country. The problem, though, is that Shepherd's Bush is not on the normal tourist trail and to the extent that shops do hit their sales targets it will be at the expense of weaker activity in Oxford Street, Brent Cross and elsewhere.</p>",
  "<h2>Rare black rhino birth is boost to breeding plan</h2> <p>Keepers at Chester zoo are still unsure of the sex of the first black rhino born there in 10 years. The two-day-old calf has not got a name but its birth, to 10-year-old Kitani, is an important landmark. There are just 700 black rhino in the world, with the species perilously close to extinction. An international breeding programme in zoos has already seen some black rhinos returned to Africa to help boost numbers. Kevin Buley, Chester Zoo's head of zoo programmes, said: \"Our new arrival may be taking small steps at first but eventually it will have a bigger role to play as part of a coordinated breeding programme.\"<br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Woman on terror charge after police raids</h2> <p>A 40-year-old woman has been charged with a terror offence, two weeks after police raided addresses in Manchester and the Netherlands.

Four shots were fired by one marksman, and all three officers have been suspended from duty, as is routine, while the shooting is investigated.

The Pemba flying fox, which has a 1.6-metre (5.5ft) wingspan, was in danger of dying out in Africa because roast bat was a favourite dish. Twenty years ago only a few were left on the island of Pemba, in the Indian Ocean. But Cambridge-based scientists at Fauna and Flora International (FFI) have worked to help boost numbers to 22,000 by raising awareness of conservation. FFI's East Africa assistant, Joy Juma, said: \"At one time roast bat was a very common dish on Pemba.

  "<p>BT shocked investors yesterday by warning on profits and ousting the head of its under-performing IT services operation in a move that sent shares in the telecoms company to their lowest since it was floated by the Thatcher government in 1984.</p> <p>Chief executive, Ian Livingston, who took over the helm four months ago, admitted that the performance of BT Global Services had been \"particularly disappointing\" and second quarter profits will miss City expectations as a result.</p> <p>Shareholders, meanwhile, were worried that the setback could force BT to slash its dividend, which is among the most attractive in the FTSE 100. BT had pledged to increase the payout this year, but after the company yesterday said its interim payment will be frozen at last year's level, shareholders reckon its final payment could be drastically reduced. </p> <p>The fear caused a dramatic fall in BT's shares price, which plunged under the 130p level at which the company listed more than 20 years ago. The 19% fall - the most dramatic in the company's history - wiped more than \u00a32bn off BT's value.</p> <p>BT said Fran\u00e7ois Barrault had resigned with immediate effect to be replaced as head of BT Global Services by Hanif Lalani, currently the company's finance director. Mr Barrault will receive almost \u20ac1m (\u00a3700,000) in compensation under his contract.</p> <p>Although BT Global Services has been successful in winning new business with major global customers such as Reuters and Unilever, costs have spiralled out of control under the 18-month leadership of the Frenchman. </p> <p>As a result, Lalani is expected to force through cost cutting which will lead to job losses among BT Global Services' worldwide workforce of 37,000. A BT spokesman refused to comment on the level of potential job losses but insiders fear hundreds could be axed.</p> <p>BT Global Services was set up more than five years ago to move the company into the lucrative market for IT services. It already accounts for a sizeable chunk of the group's revenues, but its profitability has consistently failed to live up to the City's expectations. In the first quarter of this year the unit made revenues of \u00a32.2bn - more than 40% of BT's total quarterly revenues - but its profit was just \u00a3239m, compared with group profits of over \u00a31.4bn. </p> <p>Two years ago the board set the business a \"medium term\" target of profit margins of 15%, but progress has been slow.</p> <p>Yesterday BT admitted that its margins will be in the range of 7% to 8% this year. Profits in the second quarter of this year will be down - at \u00a3120m.</p> <p>\"We acknowledge that the performance in this part of the group is unsatisfactory and are committed to taking decisive action to rectify the situation,\" said Livingston.</p> <p>The poor performance of BT Global Services - in contrast to the rest of the business which is performing in line with expectations - has shattered Livingston's forecasts for the company as a whole. In July he said BT would increase revenue, profits before financial charges and earnings per share this year. Now it only expects to increase revenues.</p>",
  "<p>Football is just too knee-jerk these days. We wait for years for someone to fill <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/england\">England's</a> \"problem\" left-wing position, then a fine young player comes along who can do the job for the next decade and as soon as he misplaces a couple of crosses the supporters start to boo. Not all of them, of course, but enough for Stewart Downing to admit that reporting for international duty has, at times, felt like a \"chore\".</p> <p>It probably says more about the ladies and gentlemen who follow their beloved \"Ing-er-lund\" than the man himself. Or maybe Downing is just an easy scapegoat because he plays for a club that is perceived as \"uncool\". Either way, it is a pity England's followers have to be so unforgiving when the target of their derision is, in so many ways, one of the few international footballers with whom the average man on the street should be able to identify.</p> <p>On Thursday, Downing was involved in a community project with some of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/middlesbrough\">Middlesbrough's</a> out-of-work 16- to 18-year-olds and, to see him in action, was to witness a throwback to those sepia-tinted days when top-division footballers always had time for other people and were naturally at ease in the company of supporters.</p> <p>\"I just really enjoy doing these things,\" Downing later explained. \"A lot of these people are from the estates where I grew up, so I can easily relate to them. People have it tough there but I know they are good people. They just need a bit of confidence, a bit of a push.\" </p> <p>Downing, you quickly learn, is not interested in diamond earrings or fancy haircuts. \"I have mates in football, but my real friends will always be the lads I grew up with,\" he says. \"They keep me totally grounded. It's like a reality check being around them. They're all Boro fans and they give me more stick than anyone.\"</p> <p>The classic local-boy-done-good, he is happiest in this environment and, as he goes through his life story it becomes very apparent that, just as Wayne Rooney has been shaped by his upbringing in Croxteth, Downing's personality emanates from his own childhood in Pallister Park - a part of Middlesbrough where, to borrow an old gag, even the alsatians go round in twos.</p> <p>\"It was tough but I would not change anything,\" he says. \"My mam and dad kept me out of trouble, watching out for me. Football helped too. There were always games after school to keep us busy. The teachers were pushy with me and helped keep me on the straight and narrow. But I do know other lads - good lads when they were younger - who went the way of drugs and prison. </p> <p>\"A couple of weeks ago I saw a lad who I had not seen for maybe five or 10 years. It turned out he'd been locked up. But he's got a wife and kids now and he told me he was doing well for himself, so good on him. It makes me pleased to know that the lads from my area who have had it tough and made a few mistakes can turn it around.\"</p> <p>Growing up, Downing's family did not have a car, meaning they had to find alternative transport to get him to football practice. \"My dad used to take me everywhere on his bike. I would sit on the crossbar with my boots over the handlebars and people would say, 'Here he is ... on his dad's bike again!' Rain, hail or snow, my dad was there, pedalling away. Looking back, he has to be the biggest influence on my career, in terms of determination and pushing me.\"</p> <p>Stewart Downing Sr worked on the oil rigs, or as a painter and decorator, but he was also a good footballer. \"He went to Aston Villa and they were going to take him,\" reports his son. \"But my mam was having her first child so he decided not to go. He wouldn't change anything either.\"</p> <p>Theirs is a close family, but it has not always been easy. \"I've had that [stick] at games and my dad does lose it sometimes,\" says the 23-year-old Downing. \"I tell him to try to ignore it. At Middlesbrough, for example, 95% of the crowd are brilliant to me. You will always get someone calling you, and the thing about Dad is that he always wants to fight my corner. There are a few stories I can't repeat.\" One is of him taking umbrage about the way Steve McClaren was treating his son, then 17, and pinning the then Middlesbrough manager against the wall. \"That's the one,\" nods Downing grinning. </p> <p>So what does Downing make of the England boo-boys himself? \"When you are young, you can take it to heart. You can drop. My message to anyone who boos is, 'What are you doing? It is not helping one bit'. I understand their frustrations but the players hold up their hands and say if they have not played well. It's not like we are trying to play badly.\"</p> <p>Has playing for England ever lost its enjoyment? \"I found that for a while. It was a little bit of a chore. Players would think, 'What's the point if I am only going to get booed?' But why should I let those people stop me doing what I want, and that is playing for England. It's still the pinnacle. They can boo all they want but if I get picked for England I must be doing something right.\"</p> <p>He knows, too, that it is a load of guff to say football is more important than life or death. When Downing was at primary school, his younger sister, Vicki, was fighting a losing battle against leukaemia. She contracted the disease when she was two and died when she was four. \"I didn't really know what was going on,\" he recalls. \"I try not to ask my mam and dad many questions about it. But I remember their visits to the hospital. It would be my mam one night, dad the next. It must have been hard for them. I'm just glad it happened when I was younger rather than older.\"</p> <p>Those childhood memories mean modern-day problems tend to pale into insignificance, but his professional life is not without other issues. Downing came close to leaving Middlesbrough a couple of summers ago, having been led to believe that playing on Teesside would affect his chances of playing for England. He was persuaded not to - \"the chairman [Steve Gibson] got to me,\" he smiles. Since then he has not just parted company with his agent, Ian Elliott, but made an allegation of fraud to the police. </p> <p>Elliott denies any wrongdoing and Middlesbrough's manager, Gareth Southgate, believes the affair may have damaged Downing's form. But the player disagrees. \"It's something I could do without but it has not affected my football. I have had to block it out. But I have had good support. Gareth has said to me, 'If you need anything we are there for you'.\"</p> <p>His club's caring side could also be gauged by the way Downing, Justin Hoyte and Andrew Taylor, devoted themselves to Thursday's project, as part of the Premier League's Creating Chances campaign. The players helped design a new strip, the idea being to encourage the participants to try new skills. Downing's own kit had sleeves that came off if defenders pulled at them and 'DJ Downing' on the back. </p> <p>\"I went over to Ibiza and did some deejaying in the clubs and bars,\" he explains. \"I am not interested in anything else, not golf, or cricket. I get a nervous excitement doing it, a bit like a big game. Plus you can chat to the crowd. It's something I might go into when I finish playing.\" But that is a long way away and, before then, the local-boy-done-good would like to think he can win over a national audience.</p>",

Illustration: Matthew Williamson</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Williamson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was well after 9pm on Monday September 15 this year when Gordon Brown made an appearance at the Downing Street reception being hosted by his wife, Sarah, to mark London Fashion Week. His tardiness surprised no one; after all, Lehman Brothers had filed for bankruptcy that morning. While the fashion editors, retailers and models in the room had gone from a marquee by the Serpentine and Luella Bartley's avant-garde party dresses to Paul Smith's catwalk show at Claridge's on their way to Downing Street, Brown had spent the day dealing with an unfolding financial crisis. He had made his way home from the Canary Wharf offices of Citigroup, where he had attempted to broker a deal with Sir Victor Blank, chairman of Lloyds TSB, to take over HBOS. If Brown looked a little tired and distracted as he made a swift circuit of the cashmere-clad, champagne-fuelled crowd and made a quiet exit, it was understandable. </p> <p>During this autumn's catwalk show season, not even the most determined fashionista could live in a bubble. There have been other fashion weeks over which the shadow of bad times has fallen, but this time show season collided head-on with financial meltdown. Crisis segued into catastrophe. The clothes on the catwalk had been conceived, in large part, during the early summer, when the talk was of whether we were headed for recession or mere downturn. But now, in early autumn, the world's fashion buyers had the unenviable task of committing to chequebook their judgment of what women will want to spend their money on next spring, at a time when a global run on the banks was not inconceivable, and recession looked certain. The question they grappled with was what, in these circumstances, would women want to wear?</p> <p>The oldest adage about fashion and the economy is that hemlines rise and fall with the stock market. In the boom times of the 20s and the 60s, skirts were short; in the 30s and 40s, they fell. Except that, on closer inspection, even this most famous theory fails to hold water. During the wartime years, arguably the period of greatest privation in modern history, hemlines were shorter than before or after the war; in the recession of the early 90s, hemlines fell. We cannot rely on skirt length alone to track the economy through fashion. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-339220718\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2008/10/31/base220130.jpg\" alt=\"Vivienne Westwood design\" width=\"130\" height=\"220\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vivienne Westwood: 'Invest in key items.'

Fashion has to do with ideas, the way we live, what is happening,\" said Coco Chanel. Arguably, the most compelling fashion designers have long been those who engage with the zeitgeist. In early September, Cathy Horyn, the fashion editor of the New York Times, saw a direct link between the tunics layered over trousers at Marc Jacobs' catwalk show and the pop-over aprons of the Depression era. Weeks later, as investors from London to New York scrambled to buy gold bullion, Miuccia Prada in Milan brought a new meaning to investment dressing by pronouncing that what women really care about \"at a primitive level\" is gold, dressing her models in Mad Men-esque skirt suits but in metallic gold linen. The December issue of American Vogue will focus on how to be stylish in a difficult economic climate, with editor Anna Wintour challenging designers to produce credit-crunch-friendly party dresses. (Phillip Lim's answer - a \u00a3405 full-length, limited-edition black ruffled silk gown dubbed the \"Recessionista\" dress - goes on sale at Selfridges this month.) </p> <p>The autumn 1930 Sears catalogue declared that \"thrift is the spirit of the day. Reckless spending is a thing of the past.\" It's clear economic slowdown affects fashion in the most basic way - customers have less cash to spend. (Those in the luxury industry who like to insist that recession won't affect the top end of the market might be disquieted to hear that haute couture, which in 1925 was France's second largest export, had fallen to 27th by 1930.) </p> <p>In the 30s, the slowdown in spending was matched by a new down-to-earth attitude. The mannered, boyish silhouette of the 20s was jettisoned; by the early 30s \"curves were admitted to exist and allowed to be seen... Fashions were easy, graceful, rather softly shaped, even to the point of limpness,\" writes Elizabeth Ewing in her History Of 20th Century Fashion. In the 70s and in the early 90s, recession once again appeared to effect a softening of the silhouette, a retreat into nostalgia, after the bold, angular shapes and futuristic aspirations of the 60s and 80s. Jo Hooper, head of womenswear at John Lewis, believes we are experiencing a similar change now. \"What we're calling the 'fear factor' is causing a slowdown in what has been a rapidly changing silhouette.\" If she is right, the angular, armoured-looking torso shape - stiff jacket, and exaggerated shoulders - which has dominated the Paris catwalks for several years may be forced to beat a retreat. </p> <p>But the relationship between fashion and the economy is not a simple one. A change in economic fortunes can exert a directional pull, but in opposite directions. As Hooper says, anything that affects us on an emotional level - as the current level of economic uncertainty does - matters to retailers, because \"you want to feel good about a purchase - after all, that's why you're doing it, really\". Some retailers believe their customers are drawn to an aesthetic of restraint and comfort during lean times: Hooper identifies in the current vogue for round-shouldered shapes a desire for \"cocooning, which is the feeling of wrapping up, of hunkering down. It's a basic human instinct.\"</p> <p>On the other hand, some observers point to the lure of escapism in straitened eras. As George Orwell wrote in 1937, \"the girl who leaves school and gets a dead-end job can still look like a fashion-plate for a pittance. You may have pennies in your pocket and not a prospect in the world, and only the corner of a leaky bedroom to go home to; but in your new clothes, you can stand on a street corner, indulging in a private daydream of yourself as Marlene Dietrich.\" </p> <p>After 9/11, upscale New York boutiques reported a surge in demand for lower-heeled shoes: on the shopfloor, they said, women were explaining they wanted shoes they could run in if necessary. The financial crisis has not had the same effect: heel heights have been rising steadily for several years, and look set to continue their skyward trajectory next season. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-339220719\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2008/10/31/base1401.jpg\" alt=\"Betty Jackson design\" width=\"130\" height=\"220\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Betty Jackson keeps it simple. Illustration: Betty Jackson</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Betty Jackson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A downbeat stockmarket is not necessarily reflected in downbeat clothes. Indeed, according to fashion historian Valerie Steele, \"this whole idea that fashion is a 'reflection' of the economy is a misnomer. It would be more accurate to say that fashion and art are as much a part of living history as the economy is.\" What happens on Wall Street, says Steele, \"is mediated through the manners and mores of the time\" before influencing the fashion aesthetic. In the 60s, for instance, what impacted on fashion was not so much a booming economy as \"the anti-conventional youth movement\" which flourished in a booming economy. </p> <p>\"The hemlines theory was invented back in the 1920s. But it just doesn't hold up. Take the 20s - hemlines actually began to fall in 1927, two years before the crash. They were falling by 1969, two years before the downturn of 1971,\" says Steele. In many cases, fashion designers appear to have an ability to read the writing on the wall, without waiting for the newspaper headlines. Between 1936 and 1939 fashion began to pick up on the rumble of warmongering, with military-inspired square shoulders teamed with lower heels. Even nightgowns sported three-inch shoulder pads. At other times, we may misinterpret clothes in retrospect in the light of world events. Christian Dior is usually credited with grasping the mood of the moment with his joyous, full-skirted Corolle collection of 1947, which launched Dior's New Look - but in 1939, before the outbreak of war, the Paris collections of Chanel and Mainbocher were both modelled on a full skirt and a wasp waist. With the war came a dampener on fashion, and the trend did not catch on until Dior revisited it. </p> <p>Rosemary Harden, curator of the Fashion Museum in Bath, agrees that the notion of a catwalk aesthetic which straightforwardly reflects the economy \"feels quite glib. It's much more complex than that, and I think it's important to unpack it a bit. The 20s and 60s were a time not just of boom but of liberation. The short skirts of the 20s were driven as much by the rise of sportswear as by the stockmarket. The sense of liberation cut across the social spectrum - there are photos of my grandma in south-east London wearing short knitted skirts. The 20s, like the 60s, was a time of opportunity, a time of people not feeling shackled. Opportunity led to newness and experimentation. It is connected to a buoyant economy, but the link is not as direct as people imagine.\"</p> <p>Simon Doonan, creative director of Barneys department store in New York and author of the memoir Beautiful People, is rather more blunt. The notion of fashion design reflecting the economic mood is \"a total fallacy. Fashion people live in a creative hermetic bubble, and are rarely so tuned in to the political or financial vicissitudes of the world. The idea that they might have a Dr Strangelove conclave where they confer about hemlines and the economy is hilarious.\" Nonetheless, he says, \"there is one certainty about recession, which is that fashionistas will buy less - by which I mean one pair of Louboutins instead of three.\"</p> <p>Those expecting to find Grapes Of Wrath chic in the stores - dungarees and grubby faces as the hot new look come spring - will be disappointed. Next season's clothes are, if anything, rather more upbeat than those on sale this winter. At John Lewis, recent weeks have seen an upturn in sales of miniskirts and opaque tights, rather than catwalk-led trouser styles. It seems we are in tune with Doonan, whose advice to customers \"is always to dress up rather than down, in tough times. You owe it to your pals, family and colleagues to present yourself in an optimistic and fabulous way. Remember what Quentin Crisp said? 'When war broke out, I bought five pounds of henna.' \"</p>",
  "<p><strong>What's new pussycat?</strong></p> <p>I'm about to go on a 25-city tour of Europe with the Mick Fleetwood Blues Band. But back when I was living in Notting Hill Gate I used to pass this chap who looked pretty interesting - bright jeans, crazy shirts, a ponytail. It was only later I found out it was Tom Jones! Although back then he was still getting in the van; it was before he went meteoric. We've had a long-distance friendship ever since. He was a real rock'n'roll singer, he knew his music and he understood the blues. I went to see him in Vegas not so long ago and he still remembered the strange gangly character that was me. He stopped the show to tell this same story! </p> <p><strong>Do you remember the first time?</strong></p> <p>I remember listening to Radio Luxembourg on a crystal radio. No batteries and a very distant signal but it did work, albeit illegally. </p> <p><strong>Who wants to be a millionaire?</strong></p> <p>Every Tom, Dick and Harry on the planet but it's not as much fun as you think once you're there. Money was never that important for me. We never had a masterplan to sell records as Fleetwood Mac. With Peter Green, we were just a blues band. </p> <p><strong>Who's that girl?</strong></p> <p>Well I was looking for a good place to record with Bob [Welch] one day and in one studio the engineer played us a demo. I saw this girl through the glass and the engineer told me it was actually her singing. So for me it really was like, \"Who's that girl?\" I had no idea that Bob was about to leave and pretty soon I'd be asking her to join Fleetwood Mac. That girl was Stevie Nicks. </p> <p><strong>Is it really so strange?</strong></p> <p>No doubt the Fleetwood Mac stories are more inflated to an observer. But looking back, we did live a strange life. We used to call it \"the bubble\". And within the bubble, strange things did happen. What's not so strange, though, is that through all the pressure, drug abuse and shenanigans, we were devoted to the music; that's what saved us. </p> <p><strong>Dude, where's my car? </strong></p> <p>I actually do have a \"Dude, where's my car?\" situation. I bought a beautiful right-hand drive 1955 MG TF. My father used to own one so I had it specially done out in tribute to him, with the same red interior. Anyway, I left it in a friend's garage when I went on a road trip and when I got back about a year later, he'd sold it! He was partial to the wild life so I think it was some drug deal or something. Years later I found out it'd been shipped to Cornwall. I couldn't be bothered to track it down but I hope it's safe. </p> <p><strong>What have I done to deserve this?</strong></p> <p>That's exactly how I felt presenting the Brit Awards with Samantha Fox! And the fact you're still asking about it 20 years on means I still feel like that. It was the first time the Brits decided not to be a stuffy, black tie event which was a good idea. But the mistake they made was inviting 300 fans of some boyband who were playing down into the front. </p> <p><strong>Why?</strong></p> <p>Because they screamed throughout the whole show. The teleprompter people couldn't hear a thing. The woman in her 60s who was down in the orchestra pit was supposed to be feeding us stuff but she couldn't hear anything. The runners couldn't even hear their walkie talkies! We were left out to dry, really, and to this day we carry the burden. But I'll tell you this: we were perfect in rehearsal! </p> <p><strong>Is this it? </strong></p> <p>It's never it. I'm going to be playing until I drop.</p> <p>\u2022 The Mick Fleetwood Blues Band are on tour, see Rock &amp; Pop listings; new album Blue Again! is out now</p>",
  "<p>Three years ago, when Google and its products were not quite so potent and ubiquitous, a reporter for the technology website CNET News did a quick experiment with the company's internet search tools. For half an hour she would find out as much personal information as possible about a revered Silicon Valley business executive. In a few dozen predictable clicks and keystrokes, she had his home address, his hobbies, the level of his wealth and his political affiliations. As a case study of how Google has eroded the privacy of even the most powerful it was a useful and justifiable exercise, especially as she did not include the most sensitive material in the story she wrote.</p> <p>The executive did not see it like that. His corporation informed CNET that its use of \"private information\" had been highly inappropriate. As a punishment, the corporation would not speak to CNET reporters for a year. After a few weeks, the ban was quietly lifted, but among those who follow the computer industry the incident has not been forgotten, for one reason. The prickly executive involved was Eric Schmidt, the CEO and public face of Google.</p> <p>This sharp-eyed book, written by a business professor who teaches in Silicon Valley and has been publishing volumes on related topics since the mid-90s, is full of such telling revelations about one of the world's most important companies. Despite the subtitle, this is not really a study of the social effects of Google's unprecedented attempt to \"organise the world's information and make it universally accessible\", as the firm's first press release put it in 1999. Instead, it is a restless examination of Google's strengths and weaknesses, and contradictions. Stross is not a hatchet man or a frustrated outsider: his thank-yous to Google staff from Schmidt downwards take up three paragraphs of the acknowledgments. But the company that emerges from this book is a more rickety and interesting enterprise than non-geeks might imagine.</p> <p>For a start, Google is still quite small. At the end of 2007, despite almost a decade of feverish growth and handling two-thirds of all internet searches in the US, it had fewer than 17,000 employees, only twice as many as the London borough of Camden. Visiting the Googleplex, the company's main compound, Stross finds that \"the signature buildings are not much bigger than those of a single suburban high school\". Similarly, for all Google's proliferating, seemingly all-pervading desktop services, from Google Maps to Google Apps, from Google Book Search to Google Earth, from Gmail to YouTube, which it bought in 2006 for almost \u00a31bn, Google still only has one business in the traditional, profit-driven sense: the selling of modest text-only advertisements next to its internet search results.</p> <p>Stross describes lucidly how the company came up with and refined its search business. He points out that Google's ingenious strategy - making billions by matching ads to content it does not own - is reliant on much of the internet remaining an open, under-commercialised environment. \"If even a small number of owners of [popular] websites were to exclude Google ... demanding, perhaps, that Google share revenue earned by indexing their sites ... then Google's ability to operate as it has would end,\" he writes.</p> <p>The book also deals properly with the physical side of building a digital empire. Early on, Google chose as its hardware \"a system cobbled together with inexpensive PC components\" rather than more costly specialist equipment. This was a clever, counter-intuitive decision, the first of many. Google's racks of cheap servers could easily be expanded or others added. The company then set about placing them as close to its potential customers as possible. Stross explains: \"As fast as electrons travel, physical distance still affects [online] response speed ... Reducing [it] by even a fraction of a second mattered to users, as Google discovered when it ran experiments to see if users noticed a difference between [a wait of] 0.9 seconds [and one of] 0.4 seconds ... Users were conspicuously more likely to grow bored and leave the Google site after waiting that interminable 0.9 seconds.\"</p> <p>As quick and pragmatic as its customers, Google spent the early years of this decade securing premises across America for its servers: first in commercial spaces desperate for tenants after the 2001 dotcom crash, then in its own purpose-built \"data centres\". Such was the surging demand for its services, and the amount of power the company was consuming as a result, the first such facility was established in a town with its own hydro-electric power station.</p> <p>Google's data centres function with almost no human intervention; their interiors are kept dark to save power, and research visits are not allowed. For some of Google's critics, these places are the perfect symbol of an enigmatic, over-mighty company. But Stross, for all his scepticism, does not see Google as a sinister monolith. Instead, he portrays it as an eccentric corporate environment, where teams of young Californians with PhDs work obsessively and autonomously, where grand company projects rise and fall, or are left half-completed, depending on the level of interest in the cubicles, and where an impatience to conquer the next digital frontier coexists with a deep conservatism that has kept Google wedded to the same basic internet search concept for 10 years.</p> <p>Whether web users will remain satisfied for many more years with the long shaggy lists of online sources that Google offers them is a question, frustratingly, that Stross does not properly answer. He does outline the menace to the company posed by the highly successful social networking site Facebook, \"a miniature web universe - behind a wall, inaccessible to Google\". And he lists other threats. Google's copyright dispute with publishers over its desire to make all books electronically searchable remains unresolved. Google's ad revenue may shrink, and no longer be sufficient to subsidise all its other, more experimental activities. Like most of today's swaggering web businesses, Google may have come through the dotcom crash but it has never experienced a broader recession. Finally, there are the discouraging precedents offered by industry history. \"No computer company,\" writes Stross, \"has ever been able to enjoy pre-eminence that spans two successive technological eras.\" </p> <p>This is a slightly dry book, the prose compact rather than elegant. But when so much of what is written about Silicon Valley and the web generally is still either self-servingly evangelical or sour and conspiratorial, agnostics about the whole enterprise have to find insight where they can. And Stross does include at least one rare piece of reassurance for journalists or fans of old media. According to him, Google News, the company's online attempt at sifting and presenting news stories by purely electronic means, has not been a great success. Its competitor Yahoo News gets three times as much traffic. The Yahoo site's secret? It is edited by humans. </p> <p>\u2022 Andy Beckett is writing a book about British politics in the 1970s</p>",

You'll be helping kids aged 7-18 with their homework, doing a bit of English teaching and joining in with social activities and youth camps.</p> <p>\u2022 Departs Dec 21, \u00a3495 for two weeks inc accommodation, most meals, transfer and online TEFL course, but excl flights, with Responsible Tourism (01273 600 030, <a href=\"http://www.responsibletourism.com\">responsibletourism.com</a>).</p> <p><strong>Turtle conservation, Costa Rica</strong></p> <p>Help preserve Costa Rica's heroes in a half-shell on a placement in the Ostional National Wildlife Refuge in Guanacaste, Costa Rica, which departs on December 20.</p> <p>\u2022 You can stay for 1-12 weeks, from \u00a3395 for the first week and \u00a3150 per additional week, inc accommodation in a basic hut, tent, dorm or homestay, all meals, and transfers with i-to-i (0871 781 1149, <a href=\"http://www.i-to-i.com\">i-to-i.com</a>).</p> <p><strong>Orphanage school, Thailand</strong></p> <p>Enthusiasm, a creative personality and an ability to encourage kids to have fun are the requirements in volunteers willing to travel to Singburi, in the central plains of Thailand, to help out in a school attached to a large orphanage, which is also open to underprivileged families. You'll teach English informally, work with kids in the vegetable garden, join in with creative, sporting and environmental awareness activities, but there's a lot of freedom to decide yourself how to best use your time and skills.</p> <p>\u2022 Departing Dec 14, you can stay for a week or more from \u00a3219pp, including accommodation (you can choose a homestay or a dorm) and food, with Real Gap (01892 516 164, <a href=\"http://www.realgap.co.uk\">realgap.co.uk</a>).</p> <p>endnote</p>",
  "<p>My mum - I've known her long enough to see a pattern emerging - calls me by my full name only when I'm in trouble. If I've been good - stayed out of jail for another year and delivered her grandsons to her with their faces washed - she'll call me Chris. But if I dare to walk across her carpet with my shoes on, she'll raise a sardonic eyebrow and murmur: \"Christopher James Cleave!\" It's a tradition that my own children have seized on with gusto. This week, I was shouting back at some sophistry on the radio when our two-year-old picked up the remote control for the stereo, levelled it at my head and, with a grave expression, pressed \"pause\". I was so surprised that I stopped, my mouth frozen in mid-indignation. He then replaced the remote control gently on the kitchen table, pursed his lips in satisfaction and went back to eating his cereal. In the sudden silence you could hear every spoon-click and every crunch of his Coco Pops. Our five-year-old nodded in approval. He murmured: \"That's better, isn't it, Christopher James Cleave?\"</p> <p>My wife, once she had finished laughing, spent the rest of the week trying out the other remote control buttons on me. A favourite, it turns out, is \"rewind\". It's surprisingly fun. When my wife and I met, I was 26, carefree but sensible, and holding down a grown-up job. I only went feral after she married me. Now she presses \"rewind\" and I can pretend to be the man I was before I abandoned solid industry in favour of the speculative field of letters, stopped paying into a pension plan and hoped everything would turn out for the best. That was the dream. The reality now, it transpires, is that I'm not so much a self-employed person as a global recession in microcosm. I'm the credit crunch as one-man-band - look closely and you'll see I'm playing the IMF's part with cymbals strapped to the insides of my knees. When your bank account is empty and your kids are \"pausing\" you and your wife is \"rewinding\" you and you find yourself answering back at Radio 4, perhaps it's time to lend half an ear to what your family is trying to say.</p> <p>Khalil Gibran famously wrote \"Your children are not your children.\" He was lucky to be writing in the days before DNA testing could refute such a claim, but even today his words have a certain figurative power. \"You may house their bodies, but not their souls,\" he wrote - or in other words, your children will answer back. I certainly heard mine loud and clear this week. And I'm not talking about Tuesday, when our two-year-old emptied his potty over the banisters because he wanted to \"look how far poo-poo go down stair\". Even on a figurative level, I failed to find poetry in that. </p> <p>And I don't think even Khalil would have enjoyed Thursday, when my five-year-old shouted, \"Why is that fat woman fat?\" in the queue for the bus. (If Khalil had been with us at the bus stop, I might have pretended my children were his.) No, the favour my children did me was to \"pause\" me over the breakfast table. Once I'd got over the shock, I started to get over myself. Perhaps there are things it's only possible to hear from people who don't yet have the words to say them. And maybe Khalil Gibran did have a point when he wrote of our children that \"You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.\" OK, so he was a wise man - but I bet his mum still called him by his full name when he was in trouble. \"Gibran Khalil Gibran bin Mikha'il bin Sa'ad,\" I can hear her saying, \"don't you dare walk across my nice carpet with your shoes on!\"</p>"
