  "<h2>David Hopps</h2> <p><strong>Highlight of the season</strong></p> <p>Sitting on the popular bank at Scarborough at Festival time watching Yorkshire v Kent with, I kid you not, the sun shining from a cloudless sky. And KP's first press conference as captain, which was so full of love it gave me an insight into what the 1960s must have been like.</p> <p><strong>Lowlight of the season</strong></p> <p>The faulty registration of Azeem Rafiq, which caused Yorkshire to be excluded from the Twenty20, was an appalling administrative oversight which let down a young player whose family had been conducting a high-profile campaign for political asylum.</p> <p><strong>Player of the season</strong></p> <p>England player: Jimmy Anderson for his growing mastery of the swinging ball. A tougher mental approach, a coach who has allowed his natural talent to blossom and the faith of selectors have made his season. County player: Ravi Bopara.</p> <p><strong>Failure of the season</strong></p> <p>Rikki Clarke caused bemusement when he left Surrey for Derbyshire saying it would reignite his England career. Surely some mistake. He resigned as captain before the end of the season to join Warwickshire.</p> <p><strong>Shot of the season</strong></p> <p>Murray Goodwin's six over long-on from the last ball of the match which won the Pro40 competition for Sussex at Trent Bridge and robbed Nottinghamshire of their first one-day trophy for 17 years.</p> <p><strong>If you were David Collier what would you change?</strong></p> <p>Multiply the payments to counties fivefold to ensure that they pick more young English players. And appoint the Headingley gatemen as a second tier of immigration officials with orders to imprison all second-rate Kolpak signings without trial.</p> <p><strong>Player who could be a millionaire</strong></p> <p>If I woke up as Stuart Broad I don't think I'd be too worried about my mortgage. And, as a riskier prediction, watch out for a 17-year-old St Lucian called Dalton Polius: lots of talent, wonderful attitude.</p> <h2>Paul Weaver</h2> <p><strong>Highlight of the season</strong></p> <p>Seeing Steve Harmison return to invigorate the England side and lead Durham to their first County Championship.</p> <p><strong>Lowlight of the season</strong></p> <p>The greed with which Twenty20 cricket was pursued could be one of sport's great morality tales. Also, giving Michael Vaughan a new central contact when he's not good enough for Yorkshire.</p> <p><strong>Player of the season</strong></p> <p>Watching Marcus Trescothick, at peace with himself, open for Somerset was one of the few warming experiences in a damp, cold summer.</p> <p><strong>Failure of the season</strong></p> <p>Surrey. The richest county of them all were a ragbag of strong egos and fading talents and Shoaib Akhtar was the worst overseas signing of them all. And the Duke cricket ball.</p> <p><strong>Shot of the season</strong></p> <p>KP's switch-hit off a bewildered Scott Styris in Durham. \"Was that a switch-hit or a reverse sweep?\" a cricket writer asked a colleague. Can you imagine Neville Cardus asking RC Robertson-Glasgow such a question?</p> <p><strong>If you were David Collier what would you change?</strong></p> <p>Ensure that all but the very best Kolpaks are squeezed out of the game. Although, with only one overseas player, one or two per county can help maintain playing standards.</p> <p><strong>Player who could be a millionaire</strong></p> <p>Stuart Broad in the short term but in the future watch out for Hampshire's Liam Dawson, a real talent.</p> <h2>Lawrence Booth</h2> <p><strong>Highlight of the season</strong></p> <p>Tyron Henderson's last three balls in the final of the Twenty20 Cup to earn Middlesex their Stanford payday. Kent needed six but managed only two, and Henderson (4-0-58-0) was the hero.</p> <p><strong>Lowlight of the season</strong></p> <p>Leicestershire v Northamptonshire in May: a game that included an entire XI of players not qualified to represent England. Sir Allen Stanford's helicopter landing at Lord's did not exactly warm the heart either.</p> <p><strong>Player of the season</strong></p> <p>Worcestershire's opener Stephen Moore scored more first-class runs (1,451 at an average of 55.80) than anyone - and hit more sixes (23) - and still managed not to get talked about. Not bad for a bloke who plays half his matches on a supposed greentop.</p> <p><strong>Failure of the season</strong></p> <p>Surrey paid the predictable price for their short-term approach from 2006, when they ignored youth in pursuit of instant promotion. Their signing of Shoaib Akhtar almost brought the game into disrepute.</p> <p><strong>Shot of the season</strong></p> <p>Hard to get past KP's two switch-hits for six off Scott Styris, although Murray Goodwin's last-ball six off Charlie Shreck to win the Pro40 for Sussex at Trent Bridge had a drama of its own.</p> <p><strong>If you were David Collier what would you change?</strong></p> <p>Cut the County Championship in half. Eight four-day games per county would allow more time for practice and maintain players' sharpness throughout the season. Standards would rise; talk of a treadmill would disappear.</p> <p><strong>Player who could be a millionaire</strong></p> <p>Born in Surrey, bred in South Africa, the 21-year-old Middlesex left-hander Dawid Malan blew Lancashire away in the quarter-finals of the Twenty20 Cup with 103 in 54 balls. </p> <h2>Mike Averis</h2> <p><strong>Highlight of the season</strong></p> <p>Matthew Prior's flawless and flowing 131 - out of 277 - to set up a Sussex win in May when Trent Bridge was at its most spiteful. With the ball swinging and doing a bit off the wicket, Sussex had been 74 for six.</p> <p><strong>Lowlight of the season</strong></p> <p>Sitting through a Friends Provident match between Warwickshire and Northamptonshire where more than half the players were not qualified to play for England.</p> <p><strong>Player of the season</strong></p> <p>Marcus Trescothick, for explaining in his book and in endless interviews why he had to give up international cricket.</p> <p><strong>Failure of the season</strong></p> <p>Yorkshire crumbling to defeat at the Rose Bowl in August with a rank display of second-innings batting. From 45 for one they ended all out for 107, the body language almost as bad as the batting.</p> <p><strong>Shot of the season</strong></p> <p>Marcus Trescothick elegantly lifting Chris Martin into Row Z at Edgbaston in the Twenty20 Cup match in June. Perfectly timed on-drive and a proper cricket shot.</p> <p><strong>If you were David Collier what would you change?</strong></p> <p>Be more aggressive with Kolpak counties. There is no point to sides that import low-budget mediocrity. Drop them from the championship and see them in court.</p> <p><strong>Player who could be a millionaire</strong></p> <p>He certainly won't appear on hair gel ads and is presently too correct for one-day glory, but Yorkshire's Adam Lyth, 21 last Thursday and from Whitby, has the foundations of a complete batsman and the makings of a stellar fielder.</p> <h2>Andy Wilson</h2> <p><strong>Highlight of the season</strong></p> <p>Two Lancastrian bowling spells: Andrew Flintoff to Paul Collingwood in May, which brought back memories of his famous Ashes over at Edgbaston; and Glen Chapple's six for 40 against Kent in the penultimate game of the season in Liverpool, which effectively sealed Lancashire's safety and sent Kent plummeting from title contention to relegation in the space of a week.</p> <p><strong>Lowlight of the season</strong></p> <p>The shameless opportunism of Nottinghamshire and Glamorgan in seeking to capitalise on Yorkshire's Twenty20 registration gaffe involving Azeem Rafiq.</p> <p><strong>Player of the season</strong></p> <p>Will Smith - the unsung hero of Durham's championship triumph, who scored crucial runs during a tricky mid-season spell.</p> <p><strong>Failure of the season:</strong></p> <p>Rikki Clarke's brief stint as Derbyshire's captain.</p> <p><strong>Shot of the season</strong></p> <p>Murray Goodwin, needing three off the last ball to secure the Pro40 title for Sussex at Trent Bridge, going three better with a six. The authorities may have done their best to devalue what used to be a prestigious competition but it still came up with a great finish.</p> <p><strong>If you were David Collier what would you change?</strong></p> <p>My chairman (Giles Clarke).</p> <p><strong>Player who could be a millionaire</strong></p> <p>Ollie Rayner, Sussex's tall young off-spinner who can also bat a bit and takes sharp chances at slip.</p> <h2>Richard Rae</h2> <p><strong>Highlight of the season</strong></p> <p>The consistent high quality of the first division. Every day offered hard, competitive, highly skilled and absorbing cricket. When it wasn't raining.</p> <p><strong>Lowlight of the season</strong></p> <p>Audible obscene reactions from certain teams when decisions went against them. Lancashire, at home to Hampshire, spring immediately to mind.</p> <p><strong>Player of the season</strong></p> <p>Will Smith (Durham). After a miserable 2007, came back with a weight of runs which should see him win a place on the England Lions tour.</p> <p><strong>Failure of the season</strong></p> <p>Leaving bad light solely to the umpires' discretion. Sometimes they were the only people in the ground who thought there shouldn't be play - and that includes the players.</p> <p><strong>Shot of the season</strong></p> <p>The hook played by Paul Wiseman (Durham) against Chris Jordan (Surrey) in Guildford. Jordan is rapid, but the ball was still rising when it cleared a 30ft row of trees on the square-leg boundary. It's probably still going now.</p> <p><strong>If you were David Collier what would you change?</strong></p> <p>Reprieve Pro40 at the expense of one of the proposed Twenty20 competitions. It's the ideal length for Sunday afternoon and a lot more popular than the shorter form with a lot of regular spectators - emphasis on the regular.</p> <p><strong>Player who could be a millionaire</strong></p> <p>Chris Jordan. Potentially genuinely quick, and already a sweet striker of the ball. Began the season so impressively but latterly a victim of Surrey's appalling man management.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-338052975\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1821866263_Hockey-mums-Brightcove-16x9.flv\"/> </video>   <p>When Raymond Wejroch took to the ice for the first time, ankles buckling in his skates and head bobbing in his too-big helmet, it felt a bit like destiny, at least for his mother watching misty eyed in the stands.</p> <p>His father played ice hockey. His cousins play ice hockey. Now, aged just five and a half, Raymond is being initiated into the sport too - which gives his mother, Susan, instant membership of the group that could well decide this election: \"hockey moms\".<br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/sarahpalin\"><br>Sarah Palin's</a> arrival as Republican vice-presidential candidate - and self-described pitbull-in-lipstick hockey mom - has redefined the politics of identity in an election dominated by race, gender and age.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton's run for the Democratic presidential nomination produced widespread excitement about women candidates. Now Palin - white, middle class, and non-metropolitan - could be the deciding factor in determining whether white working- and middle-class suburban mothers vote for Barack Obama or John McCain.</p> <p>In its narrowest sense Palin, as hockey mom, can claim a personal connection to the mothers of America's 350,000 hockey-playing children and youth, concentrated in northern battleground states such as Michigan.</p> <p>The McCain camp claims though that any mother shuttling her children between school and sport or music classes can identify with Palin.</p> <p>\"It means she is down to earth and involved on that deep level with her family,\" says Wejroch, who gave up her job as a market researcher to stay home with her three sons.</p> <p>Wejroch, who says she will vote for the Republican ticket in November, does not think that Palin's career as Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate makes McCain's running mate any less focused on her traditional role. \"Even though she is involved in such a high position in her state, she makes sure she has got time for her family,\" says Wejroch.</p> <p>Others at the rink in Livonia, a Detroit commuter town, agree that Palin seems more approachable than an earlier generation of female politician including Clinton or even Nancy Pelosi, the first woman speaker of the house and, like Palin, a mother of five.</p> <p>Clinton, with her suits and her pride in her profession as a lawyer and senator, was off-putting to those women who still place importance in traditional roles. \"[Palin] just seems like someone you can relate to. Hillary Clinton doesn't seem like you could sit down and have a cup of coffee with her,\" says Vicky Rokas, a solid Republican voter who counts herself a Palin fan.</p> <p>For Rokas, who has spent years shuttling three hockey-playing children to practice and out-of-state tournaments, Palin's hockey mom experience is just as valid as her professional credentials.</p> <p>Rokas argues that hockey moms, who must supervise homework and dinner ice-side, are by necessity focused and disciplined. They must be: it costs about $1,500 (\u00a3815) a season for a child to play the sport. They are also tough when the situation warrants. Rokas admits to her share of confrontations with parents of children on opposing teams.</p> <p>And while Palin's son, Track, is now in the US military and has not played hockey for more than a year, Rokas says the Republican politician is still entitled to call herself a hockey mom.</p> <p>But the positive image is far from universal. Many women admit a visceral dislike of McCain's running mate.</p> <p>\"She scares the hell out of me. Every time I see her I go home and open my wallet, and write another cheque for Obama,\" says Pilar Herrera-Fierro, looking up from her copy of the New York Times to watch her daughter's practice.</p> <p>The immediate burst of enthusiasm about Palin's candidacy has faded. The comedian Tina Fey has turned Palin's gaffes on foreign policy - such as the line about seeing Russia from Alaska - into a spoof on the TV show Saturday Night Live. </p> <p>Women voters have also become more conscious of Palin's retrograde views on global warming and others issues. </p> <p>\"It is this narrative of working mom that has really captured the imagination of women right now, and it has not yet really touched on policy issues,\" said Debbie Walsh, the director of the Centre of Women and American Politics at Rutgers University in New Jersey.</p> <p>Even so, Palin has eroded Obama's early advantage among women voters. A Lifetime poll last week showed he and McCain almost tied in support among women, 47% and 45% respectively. The poll also showed married white women favoured McCain as the candidate who could bring \"real\" change and who understood their concerns.</p> <p>That could cost Obama. Women voters have determined the outcome of every US election for the last 40 years.</p> <p>Since the early 1980s more women have turned out to vote than men and they have tilted towards the Democrats. The 1996 contest saw Bill Clinton re-elected with strong support from so-called \"soccer moms\". Although in 2004 women swing voters - dubbed \"security moms\" that year - generally favoured John Kerry, enough voted for George Bush for the incumbent to win.</p> <p>They are also crucial in Livonia and the other predominantly white suburbs around Detroit. Obama cannot win Michigan without a strong showing in the suburbs, and he cannot win the White House without Michigan. </p> <p>While he has moved ahead of McCain in the polls in the state in the last few days, the Democrat needs to hang on to women voters. Unfortunately for Obama, there are signs they have been undergoing a shift to the right.</p> <p>Michigan, the home of America's dying car industry, has the country's highest unemployment rate at 8.9%. Ed Sarpolus, a prominent Michigan pollster, argues that economic uncertainty - heightened by the collapse on Wall Street, the housing crisis and higher petrol prices - has made women voters in Michigan especially nervous about the prospect of further upheaval.</p> <p>Even the most fanatical hockey families are economising. Livonia, which runs the most popular youth hockey programme in the greater Detroit area, has seen enrolment drop this year. </p> <p>The cutbacks and uncertainty make women less receptive to Obama's message of change. </p> <p>\"What has been happening in Michigan is that younger women, especially those under 40, are becoming more conservative - although not so much more church-going,\" Sarpolus says. \"They are fearful, because of the economy, for their kids and worried about their husband's jobs.\"</p> <p>The McCain campaign is also mining that economic discontent, and hoping to deflect resentment against the Bush administration - which could help Obama - on to Michigan's Democratic governor, Jennifer Granholm.</p> <p>However, the Obama camp believes that their man stands to do better in a poor economic climate, and that \"bread and butter\" issues will eventually outweigh Palin's emotional appeal to more conservative women voters. </p> <p>\"What we found here on the ground is that economic issues trump everything else,\" said Amy Chapman, Obama's Michigan campaign director. \"The economy is the number one issue.\"</p>",
  "<p>Dave and I met at university and married in 2000. We always planned to have children, and two years ago we found a little house in a moorland village near the sea, perfect for a family. We started trying for a baby in July last year, and I was pregnant by the end of the month. We were both ecstatically happy. We chose the name Susie for a girl.</p> <p>I was fine throughout the pregnancy and carried on my work as a community staff nurse until about five weeks before giving birth. I suffered from back problems and had some physiotherapy but it isn't uncommon and just meant that I needed to take it easy.</p> <p>My labour pains started on April 4 and it was all very exciting, if frightening. But 25 hours later I was still in labour and went into hospital. I burst into tears because we had planned a home birth, but the midwives were lovely and I felt in safe hands.</p> <p>After 39 hours I had an epidural and Susie was born two hours later, back-to-back (with her head down but facing my abdomen) and I had to have an episiotomy (a perineum incision). I bled heavily and almost lost consciousness but when she was born it was absolutely fantastic. She was small and perfect and rosy. I felt immediately maternal.</p> <p>However, because I didn't sleep at all during labour I started to become increasingly tired and less and less actively able to look after Susie. The following night I had to have a blood transfusion and then she developed colic and cried for what felt like 24 hours a day. I came home after three days but cannot remember much after that.</p> <p>I breastfed from the word go and desperately wanted to carry on but because I was so tired I made the difficult decision to give up after four weeks. I began to feel down and convinced that I would never get better and sleep again. I would get half an hour here and there at most.</p> <p>I became obsessed with sleep. Nothing seemed to work. Dave's and my parents came to stay and were wonderful. I tried to create a good sleep pattern but nothing seemed to work. I became increasingly desperate and on the edge.</p> <p>Though my memory of this time is patchy, Dave says I never expressed any overtly negative emotions towards Susie, but I was indifferent a lot of the time. I was wrapped up in my own world and everything was about me. At that point I really wasn't doing much for her, just little things like a feed or a change. Sometimes I couldn't do anything at all and Dave and our families did everything.</p> <p>At the end of the first month it was clear that I had post-natal depression but after six weeks it began to get worse. My negative thought processes became more surreal and disjointed. I was convinced I was going to end up in a psychiatric hospital for the rest of my life. At this point I started thinking that Dave and Susie would be better off without me. </p> <p>I would call friends and family and tell them how dreadful my life was, which is very out of character for me. They were naturally concerned and would call Dave and tell him how worried they were.</p> <p>I tried to kill myself for the first time around eight weeks after Susie was born. At that point I was mainly focusing on trying to get some sleep. We went to stay at Dave's parents' house while they stayed at our house with Susie so we could be in a peaceful environment. On one of these occasions, while Dave was asleep I walked into the kitchen and took tablets belonging to his mum. I just wanted to go to sleep and never wake up.</p> <p>Somehow I survived the night. Dave is a paramedic and in the morning he immediately recognised the signs of an overdose. He took me to the nearest hospital where I was interviewed by psychiatric staff and discharged back to our local authority and a mental health team. At the time my only regret was that I had failed to kill myself.</p> <p>Back home, Dave was able to take time off from work to look after me. One day he was in the shower and Susie was asleep. I took the car keys and went and started the engine. All I knew was that I was going to kill myself, even if I didn't know how. For some reason I came back and told Dave what I had done. At this point he bought a safe and locked everything dangerous in it.</p> <p>Not long afterwards I tried to electrocute myself. Nothing happened. One day Dave was on the sofa asleep with Susie on his chest. His mum said something about how comfortable they looked and I believed that they would be better off without me. A few minutes later Dave came upstairs to find me vomiting in the bathroom. I had drunk bleach. I can't explain what was going through my mind at the time as I simply can't remember but Dave tells me that none of my thoughts appeared to be logical. He took me to hospital. I started vomiting blood in the car and he called and arranged for an ambulance to meet us halfway.</p> <p>In the ambulance Dave was attempting to treat me but I was convinced that he and the other crew were torturing me. When I arrived in hospital they gave me milk but because it tasted funny I thought they were poisoning me.</p> <p>I became convinced that everyone was out to get me on a governmental level. I thought Dave was a robot or someone pretending to be him. In the hospital there was a sign saying the floor was slippery and I imagined that they had deliberately made it dangerous to kill me so I began trying to navigate the room using just chairs. </p> <p>The following day I was sectioned and taken to a psychiatric hospital. My delusions were very vivid and everyone agreed immediately that I was suffering from puerperal psychosis or post-partum psychosis (PP), a condition that affects about 1 in 700-1,000 women soon after giving birth.</p> <p>Because Susie wasn't with me at that stage I believed I had killed her. As I was being wheeled into the ambulance I began banging my head convinced that she was dead and I was going to be tortured for it. </p> <p>I stayed in the psychiatric hospital for 10 days with a few hours' leave here and there. I was placed on anti-psychotic drugs and slowly started to improve. One time when my mother visited me I imagined her looking evil with yellow teeth. </p> <p>On my first day's leave Dave and I went for a trip to Padstow and I felt much better. I was so happy to be out and he was so pleased to see me that way that he didn't really notice that I was behaving manically. I spent too much money and suggested that we had lunch at Rick Stein's restaurant, something I would never normally do. The warning signs were there but the relief at feeling positive took precedence.</p> <p>During this time, despite being an atheist, I became obsessed with ideas about Christianity and had an overwhelming desire to read the Bible. I remembered a saint who had her eyes taken out as punishment and I began talking about poking mine out. The Bible fuelled my delusions and I descended into thoughts of hell and damnation.</p> <p>Quite early on in my diagnosis somebody had suggested electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and at this stage I started to think it might be the answer. Understandably, Dave was worried about it but the psychiatrist said it would be a good idea. I had six treatments, with a general anaesthetic, each lasting around half an hour. After the first one my mood lifted straight away and my delusions disappeared. I dipped slightly but after the second one I began to stabilise.</p> <p>One of the side-effects of the treatment was short-term memory loss and I once even asked Dave whether we had a baby. There is a video of us on the beach and I sound and seem normal but I have no recollection of it.</p> <p>The ECT isn't a long-term treatment and it's not uncommon to relapse. That terrifies me but I am on anti-depressants and also anti-psychotic drugs, the latter of which I hope to come off in a month's time. I already feel lots better but I think it will take a long time to come to terms with what happened. I do feel a huge amount of guilt that Susie missed out on me in the early months. My health visitor has arranged a counselling session to talk about the birth as I think this will help. I have spent the past month simply getting to know my baby and acting like a real mother at last. It's wonderful to have come out the other side. </p> <p>I feel passionately that if my husband and I had known more about the condition sooner we would have got the appropriate help earlier. PP is more likely to affect people with a pre-existing mental illness, such as depression, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia and it is vital that health professionals are alert to its presentation, particularly as it is, thankfully, relatively rare. There is light at the end of the tunnel though, and I am starting to see it.</p> <p>\u2022 Rachel Brand is a pseudonym. She was speaking to Hazel Davis.

  "<p>The changes the financial world has seen over the past three weeks are immense and remain hard to grasp, especially as the dust has yet to settle. </p> <p>The big picture is that after the credit boom of the past decade the over-expanded banking system had to contract. That the contraction would be so severe and so rapid, taking place in just a couple of weeks, is nothing short of astonishing, and worrying.</p> <p>After Bear Stearns collapsed in March, this month has seen the giant mortgage corporations Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae nationalised, Lehman Brothers go bust, the US's biggest insurer, AIG, nationalised, investment bank Merrill Lynch fall into the arms of Bank of America, while Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have said they will cease being pure investment banks. Oh, and Washington Mutual collapsed on Friday in what is the biggest bank failure the US has ever seen.</p> <p>Worried? You should be. In Britain, HBOS, the biggest mortgage lender, is to be swallowed by Lloyds TSB and Bradford &amp; Bingley is to be nationalised. There is almost certainly worse to come. Northern Rock's failure was clearly the tip of the iceberg.</p> <p>Grasping that the economic consequences of all this are going to be dire, the US government has been trying to get a $700bn (\u00a3380bn) rescue package past Republican dissidents to prevent the entire banking system imploding. </p> <p>Although the US public doesn't see the sense in Main Street bailing out Wall Street, the alternative of doing nothing could be much, much worse.</p> <p>As President Teddy Roosevelt once said: \"In any moment of decision, the best thing you can do is the right thing, the next best thing is the wrong thing, and the worst thing you can do is nothing.\"</p> <p>At least the gravity of the situation in the US has been recognised.</p> <p>\"I believe if the credit markets are not functioning, jobs will be lost, the unemployment rate will rise, more houses will be foreclosed upon, GDP will contract, that the economy will just not be able to recover,\" said Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke last week. \"My interest is solely for the strength and recovery of the US economy.\"</p> <p>Though it remains to be seen exactly how treasury secretary Henry Paulson's plans end up working, at least there is a policy response going on.</p> <p>So what about over here? The financial system is every bit as gummed up as it is in the US. Last week the Bank of England and European Central Bank repeatedly injected overnight fund into money markets but Thursday was probably the grimmest day since the credit crunch began. Things eased a bit on Friday with further injections of money against a wider range of collateral, but the rot is still there.</p> <p><strong>Mortgage famine</strong></p> <p>The result - several banks are putting up mortgage rates again. And a survey on Friday showed two-thirds of mortgage brokers were unable to find clients a mortgage over the past month.</p> <p>House prices continue to fall at an annualised rate of about 25%. I have no problem at all with house prices falling, but the speed of the descent is a big worry for an economy that has so depended on them rising for 10 years and more.</p> <p>So are our policymakers responding to the challenge? Yes and no.</p> <p>The chancellor, Alistair Darling, made a virtue out of necessity at last week's Labour party conference by saying he would let public borrowing rise. In truth, he has no choice - the idea that he would raise taxes or cut spending as the economy is entering a recession is for the birds.</p> <p>So he is letting the \"automatic stabilisers\" work by allowing tax receipts to fall as unemployment rises and spending on benefits to go up, so the government automatically takes less tax out of the economy and raises spending.</p> <p>But the government went into this with the public purse some \u00a340bn overdrawn, having failed to build up a surplus during the good years. Now the deficit could blow out to \u00a3100bn or more, even before further bank nationalisations are allowed for. The next government will have to raise taxes or cut spending or probably both. </p> <p>But on the monetary policy side there has been precious little sign that the Bank of England wants to cut interest rates from 5%, even though the turbulence in money markets has shoved mortgage rates up again. The Bank loves to talk about the balance of risks to growth and inflation. Surely the balance of risks to both has worsened in the past three weeks?</p> <p>Not according to one member of the Bank's monetary policy committee, Andrew Sentance. He said last week the committee's projections made in August for growth and inflation were still a \"reasonable assessment of the outlook\". That's a hell of a brave call. Sentance argued that Britain was not facing a recession like those of the 1970s, 1980s or 1990s. Really?</p> <p>His colleague, Kate Barker, said in another speech that though there were \"storm-force winds\" in financial markets, she remained worried about wage inflation in the spring pay round. </p> <p>Given that there is no evidence of wage inflation picking up at all in the past 10 years, quite how it will do so next spring in the middle of full-blown recession when people are losing their jobs by the thousand is beyond me.</p> <p>And given that oil and commodity prices have tumbled, and that a food price war has broken out among supermarkets, inflation will soon drop like a stone. In August, the Bank's inflation report predicted that inflation would be back below its 2% target in two years. Add in the darkening economic outlook and inflation could easily drop below 1%.</p> <p><strong>Heading for recession</strong></p> <p>The Bank says it is worried that the fall in the pound's value could push up import prices. But how likely is that in the middle of a downturn when shops are slashing prices to shift goods?</p> <p>The Bank wants a period of slow growth to rid the economy of its inflationary pressures, but after the events of this month we are now more likely to have a full-blown recession.</p> <p>Only David Blanchflower, the MPC's labour market expert, seems to have grasped this, voting for a half-point cut last month. This is not about re-igniting a house price or credit boom - this is about preventing the economy tipping off a cliff. This is not about going back to the conditions of 2005 and 2006, this is about avoiding going back to the conditions of 1992 and 1993.</p> <p>Nick Parsons, economist at NAB Capital, points out that in July last year, when the economy was in danger of overheating and the Bank raised rates to 5.75%, the main Libor money market interest rate was 6.1%.</p> <p>\"Fast forward to today,\" he says. \"The UK economy is heading into recession, unemployment has risen by 100,000 in the last six months, the FTSE is down 20% and the global financial system is falling apart at the seams. And where is three-month Libor? 6.27%.</p> <p>\"The rates which individuals, households and companies borrow at are all linked to a Libor rate which is wholly inappropriate for UK economic conditions. Monetary policy thus far has been directed at increasing the quantity of money available. It is time to change its price.\"</p> <p>Amit Kara, economist at UBS, agrees. \"We believe the UK economy faces a serious risk of falling into a severe debt-induced deflationary spiral. The Bank should lower interest rates aggressively and provide term funding to banks and building societies to prevent an economic slowdown turning into a deep recession.\"</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:ashley.seager@theguardian.com\">ashley.seager@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Which newspaper group will be the first to go bust? Politics may be fascinating on both sides of the Atlantic and talk of a crisis in the financial system so constant that subeditors are already trying to ban all those nasty C-words - catastrophe, collapse, credit crunch, calamity and indeed crisis - but get a huddle of newspaper executives together in a late-night corner and what they want to know is, will we all survive? </p> <p>The numbers are not good and will get worse before they get better. Analysts predict earnings declines of as much as 30% for the ad-dependent media sector. After flying back from New York last week, Martin Sorrell of WPP said he could \"smell the fear\". The Sage of Soho believes next year will be really bad before a \"big bounceback\" in 2010.</p> <p>The question is how many UK newspaper groups will survive the next 15 months and whether anything can be done to save them, particularly in the regions. Ad revenues have already fallen off a cliff. Just look at Friday's profits warning from Associated, the owner of the Daily Mail. Property advertising in its regional arm, Northcliffe, fell 45% in July and August compared with last year. In September, the new cruellest month, Northcliffe ad revenues as a whole were down 24%. </p> <p>Although Johnston Press raised money from shareholders earlier this year, analysts fear that it could breach its banking covenants by the end of next year if revenues continue to decline at the current rate. At Trinity Mirror, a massive \u00a31.5bn pension fund liability makes it takeover-proof but also less able to withstand the travails of the financial storm. Its national flagship, the Daily Mirror, competes against a rival backed by a global media group able and willing to slash cover prices.</p> <p>Tony O'Reilly has been a loyal owner of the Independent titles despite mounting losses, but he faces a refinancing of a \u20ac200m bond next May. His advisers point out that he had no trouble refinancing another a few months ago and are confident that he will be able to do so again next spring. This is despite the turmoil of the last two weeks. A 25% price rise at the Independent will no doubt help. A 24% fall in full-price circulation over the past two years will not. </p> <p>All ad-dependent companies are being hit, of course. Yet with ITV just told that it can cut its regional budget by \u00a340m, should something not be done about trouble in the regional press? Given that the prime minister appeared to tear up competition rules governing banks last week after a glass of champagne with the former chairman of Trinity Mirror, the first option could be a relaxation of media ownership rules. </p> <p>The four groups controlling close to three-quarters of the regional market would like this to happen. Few believe it will. When the House of Lords select committee looked into it, it said there should be more competition, not less. </p> <p>Besides, competition authorities have repeatedly refused to consider that local websites and radio stations compete with newspapers.</p> <p>After years of falling sales, costs at heavily consolidated regional newspapers are already cut to the bone. Only print production could be cut further and most newspaper groups are already doing that. </p> <p>People have been predicting the end of the newspaper world for as long as any of us have worked in the business. Won't there always be a billionaire or two willing to part with some pocket change for a trophy asset? Well, most of the remaining rich seem to prefer to own a football club. Perhaps the next few years will leave newspapers a bit like lowly Millwall. Except if no one likes us we really should care.</p>",
  "<p>Peter Mandelson, the EU trade commissioner, has called for a far-reaching reform of global financial and regulatory systems to reflect the vital role of emerging economies in restoring the world's economy to health in the wake of the credit crunch.</p> <p>The former Labour cabinet minister demanded new models of global governance to take account of the redistribution of economic power in the world, appearing to back European calls for reforms of institutions such as the IMF, set up in 1944 at Bretton Woods.</p> <p>His comments, at a World Economic Forum conference on \"new champions\", found an echo among Chinese political leaders, bankers and regulators, who all demanded stricter international rules on regulation of financial institutions.</p> <p>Mandelson urged \"an international system in which not just the G7 or G8 and OECD will be reaching out and inviting so-called emerging economies in for a cup of tea every now and again or a coffee to hear their views and then politely ask them to leave as we take the decisions\".</p> <p>Insisting that the global capital market system is not \"fundamentally flawed\", he said: \"We are now looking to the larger, faster-growing economies to take up the slack. We need them to be the source of liquidity, of demand, of investment, of confidence in the global economy.\" </p> <p>Liu Mingkang, chairman of China's banking regulatory commission, demanded agreement on greater international supervision. \"The degree of leverage now is dangerous and indefensible. Worse, it is not regulated by prudential supervision,\" he said, calling US levels of pre-crisis lending \"ridiculous\".</p> <p>As senior US bankers admitted the crisis was the most acute since the Great Depression of the 1930s, China's premier Wen Jiabao promised that his country would contribute growth of about 10% a year and financial market reforms to help a global recovery.</p> <p>Chinese growth, which came close to 12% last year, has \"slowed\" to about 10% so far this year and Jiang Jianqing, chairman of ICBC, the world's biggest bank, said it could be maintained at this level. Inflation, which peaked at 8.7% this year, was down to 4.9% thanks to intervention by the monetary authorities.</p> <p>Wen said: \"We have full confidence and the ability to overcome all sorts of difficulties in order to keep our economy growing in a sound and fast manner for a longer time to come.</p> <p>\"What we can do now is to maintain China's strong, stable and relatively fast growth and avoid big fluctuations. That is the biggest contribution we can make to the world economy under the current circumstances.\"</p> <p>Stephen Roach, Asia chairman of US investment bank Morgan Stanley, said a 14-year US consumer \"binge\" had come to an end and spending growth would slow to about half of recent levels, producing a US version of Japan's \"lost decade\" of deflation. He added: \"The American consumer is toast, done, finished.\"</p>",

  "<p>For Michael Owen this was the end of a perfect week. Sandwiched between two emphatic wins in Watford, the man who led Wales to their 2005 grand slam celebrated the birth of his first son. The Saracens No8 also had a bottle of champagne to wet the baby's head when he was named man of the match after scoring his first try for his new club.</p> <p>Sonny James Owen may opt to play for Wales or England one day but, for the present, his father may force Warren Gatland to take another look at a No8 who had also led the Lions. Owen's move from the Dragons to Hertfordshire this summer was largely overshadowed by the transfer to Saracens of Bath's England captain Steve Borthwick but both made significant contributions on Saturday.</p> <p>Borthwick's decision 15 minutes from time to opt for a scrum rather than give Glen Jackson the opportunity to convert an equalising penalty changed the course of the match. Northampton had just been reduced to 14 men with the substitute scrum-half Ben Foden penalised for killing the ball. The Saracens captain knew that with Carlos Spencer taking Foden's position at the scrum the home side had an extra man. Saracens quickly exploited the space and their right-wing Rodd Penney scored the decisive try.</p> <p>The game was over and the Saints in disarray five minutes later when Owen took advantage of a side reduced to 13 men after Dylan Hartley had also been shown a yellow card and the Welshman picked the ball up at the base of a scrum to score a second try. Owen's tireless ball-carrying had been a feature of his play throughout the game and he believes Saracens' uncompromising pack, which will be strengthened by the arrival of the South African back-rower Wikus van Heerden in a month's time, can help the great underachievers challenge for trophies this season.</p> <p>\"We've shown glimpses of what we can do but there is a lot more to come and after Christmas you will see the true Saracens,\" said Owen. \"I've been really impressed by the club. Things are on a par with the set-up in the Wales team, everything is spot on with the coaching and it's a really challenging environment.\"</p> <p>Saracens also have the advantage of, apart from Borthwick, having no players in the current England and England Saxons squads. That lack of recognition needled last season but on heavy grounds in a long English winter that pack may prosper. Chris Jack will have a scan today on a sore shoulder joint that caused him to miss the second half. The All Black lock's conversion to blind-side flanker looks a smart move by head coach Eddie Jones.</p> <p>His opposite number, Jim Mallinder, refused to shed any light on the dropping of the Ireland flanker Neil Best on the eve of the game.

  "<p>As the global economic storm rips through the western world, Britain faces acute problems in rebuilding a more equal and sustainable economy. This week in Birmingham, David Cameron will strive to project the Conservatives as reliable stewards of the economy. Up to now the Tory revival has been shaped around the need to renew society. As Oliver Letwin argued: \"The social revolution we now need to achieve is as great as the economic revolution that was required in the 1980s and 1990s.\" Cameron has made the theme of \"broken Britain\" central to his politics, saying: \"The greatest challenge of the 1970s and 1980s was economic revival; the greatest challenge in this decade and the next is social revival.\" Through the brilliant construction of language and image Cameron has changed the Conservative party; retrieving some of its paternalist traditions to develop a more sophisticated modern politics.</p> <p>The government's response has been dismissive. But it cannot defeat this new Conservatism without offering a coherent alternative. It has not yet matched Cameron's pro-social rhetoric nor trumped his claim to a new values-based politics. The Conservatives' ethical and emotional language has touched a popular chord. It exposes the lack of sympathy and shrill managerialism that has been a characteristic of New Labour. It resonates among many who would never have voted for Thatcherism. </p> <p>And yet, for all their early boldness, the Tories cannot move beyond the orthodoxies of the past. Despite their emotional literacy they are unlikely to show this week any persuasive desire to move beyond their dogmatic free-market interpretation of Hayek's liberalism. They have no economic strategy with which to enact their pro-social politics and rhetoric of social justice. Economics will increasingly dominate politics - both between and within parties.</p> <p>Tory hostility to the social activist state will threaten the livelihood of millions. Without a credible political economy, their enthusiasm for localism and their ambition to expand the role and the influence of charities, social enterprises and voluntary bodies is less an embrace of local democracy and mutualism and more a revival of Thatcher's thwarted ambition to create a minimal state. The voluntary sector cannot shoulder the kind of structural change they propose. </p> <p>New Labour has not been able to exploit these contradictions due to its tone-deaf language, its one-dimensional take on Cameron and its own outdated political economy. While its centralising instincts and micromanagement of people have allowed the Conservatives to strike a chord with their criticism of state control. They have been able to portray state intervention - which has to be part of any redistributive politics - as an undesirable intrusion into people's lives. </p> <p>Despite their pro-social rhetoric, the New Conservatives will not tackle the structures of power and privilege that are distorting economic development and shaping all our destinies. They cannot bite the hand that feeds them. Two questions lie at the heart of politics over the next decade. What kind of economy do we need to develop a good society? And what kind of state will best meet the needs of individuals? The New Conservatives do not have credible answers to these questions. The future belongs to the left, but to be successful, it must confront its failings and reconnect with people.

  "<p>The aviation industry is going through a difficult period with the high cost of fuel, a downturn in passengers and global competition from European liberalisation and the transatlantic Open Skies agreements.

  "<p>For a few minutes on Saturday night, as the sun set over Great Leighs racecourse in a fabulous wash of reds and pinks, it was easy to think that after a difficult birth and troubled first six months of life, the only track in Essex had finally turned the corner. The floodlights were warming up, a big crowd was buzzing and some high-profile horses and jockeys were about to race for \u00a3200,000 in prize money.</p> <p>But things are rarely that simple at Great Leighs, and a simple turn through 180 degrees brought you face-to-face with its evil twin. With just one race gone and spectators still arriving, there were long queues of punters, both male and female, outside the two tiny, inadequate Portakabin toilets by the door of the main bar. The promise of the evening ahead appeared to be the last thing on their minds.</p> <p>Nearly there one moment, miles away the next. It has always been the Great Leighs way, through 10 years of false dawns and missed deadlines until it finally opened its doors in the spring. There is a genuine spirit of adventure and innovation about the place, a desire to make a difference. Somehow, though, there always seems to be something dull and boring to rein it back. Debts, for instance, like those owing to the racing authorities for prize money that had to be hurriedly paid last week to allow the biggest night of Great Leighs' short life to go ahead.</p> <p>It all helps to add to the Evel Knievel sensation that is never far away at Great Leighs. Saturday's big meeting - the New Holland Thoroughbred Open - was originally planned for next September, as a European trials day for the Breeders' Cup meeting in America. The track, with typical ambition, decided to bring the launch forward by 12 months. But would they clear the long line of double-deckers, and avoid the messy alternative?</p> <p>This time, at least, the answer was yes, and if there was one thing that pulled the evening through, it was the capacity crowd, estimated at around 3,500. It meant that Great Leighs finally reached a critical mass of punters, ready and eager for a big night at the track, and the unique atmosphere that comes with racing under floodlights did the rest.</p> <p>\"It feels different tonight,\" one racegoer said. \"I've been once before and it was a bit flat, but now it feels like there's lots of people here and there's something happening. They've had their problems, everyone knows that, but it's something new for the area. There are loads of people round here who really want them to do well.\"</p> <p>It would have been a huge achievement if Duke Of Marmalade, one of the five-day entries for the meeting, had turned up, but when you are trying to enthuse a crowd of largely novice racegoers, Frankie Dettori is probably even better. Having his name on the racecard felt like a hallmark to guarantee its quality, and while Dettori finished only second on Asset in the Open Sprint, he did tip \"the South African horse in the last\" to the crowd in an interview early in the evening.</p> <p>Whether he meant the winner, Mike de Kock's Lucky Find, or his stablemate Royal Vintage, the disappointing favourite, is another matter, but no one seemed too bothered.</p> <p>\"This meeting is a great idea, and we are really happy to be able to support it,\" Dettori said. \"It's a really good way for a trainer to give a horse experience of the sort of track and the turns that they would face in America, and if we are going to beat the Americans, we need to do everything we can to get things in our favour.\"</p> <p>For track officials, meanwhile, it was another step in the right direction, though there is still so much to do to create spectator facilities to match the racing. \"It's a Challenge Anneka approach, really,\" one of them said, \"we just have to rush around doing things as and when they have to be done, and when you are racing as regularly as we are, it's very hard to find the time.\"</p> <p>It is hard to say whether it will be two years or 10 before Great Leighs is complete. Money clearly remains tight, and without significant investment, it could be a very long haul indeed.</p> <p>\"When Keeneland [in Kentucky] moved to Polytrack, they staged a Grade One race on it 12 days later,\" Tim Jones, Great Leighs' racing manager, said. \"We are decades behind in this country when it comes to all-weather racing.</p> <p>\"We have to get away from the idea that it is just what happens in the winter, and what's happening here tonight can only help.\"</p> <h2>Ron Cox's tip of the day</h2> <p><strong>Croeso Bach</strong> 5.20 Brighton</p> <p>The ability to handle this unique undulating track is vital and Croeso Bach arrives boasting two summer victories over course and distance. Both of those wins were also on fast ground, but this filly has been beaten twice since on a slower terrain. The return to good to firm today will suit, and she has the chance to lead from an inside draw with the other speedsters drawn wide.</p>",

West Midlands police said the 59-year-old man died after a car was driven at him in Wolverhampton on Saturday following a confrontation between a group of men. Five men, aged between 23 and 32, were being questioned by detectives. The victim was pronounced dead in hospital.

The former Northern Ireland secretary, writing to Celtic fans, also warned he would not tolerate offensive chanting by his own club's supporters, after Celtic fans complained about the song. The Ibrox club has since asked fans to refrain from singing the song, which includes the line: \"The famine's over, why don't you go home?\" It refers to the famine which killed an estimated 1 million people in the 1840s and set in motion a mass migration of Irish people.<br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Cliff-face gardeners spark coastguard alarm</h2> <p>Two gardeners sparked a coastguard rescue operation after abseiling down a treacherous cliff face to plant flowers.

Despite their precarious position, neither gardener seemed worried by the work on a rocky outcrop in Branksome, Dorset, on Saturday. A coastguard spokesman said: \"We arrived and offered them some advice along the lines of 'don't do this' which I think they took.\"<br><strong>Matthew Taylor</strong></p>",
  "<p>The Soil Association has urged the government to ban pesticides linked to honeybee deaths around the world.</p> <p>The chemicals are widely used in UK agriculture but have been banned as a precaution in four other European countries. Last week the Italian government issued an immediate suspension after it accepted that the pesticides were implicated in killing honeybees, joining France, Germany and Slovenia.</p> <p>Peter Melchett, the Soil Association's policy director, said: \"It is typical of the lax approach to pesticide regulation in the UK that we look like being one of the last of the major farming countries in the EU to wake up to the threat to our honeybees.\"</p> <p>The pesticides, known as neonicotinoids, are approved to kill insects on a range of crops in the UK including oilseed rape, barley and sugar beet. Their use on oilseed rape is of particular concern to beekeepers as the crop's yellow flower is very attractive to honeybees.</p> <p>Germany suspended sales of the pesticides in May after 700 beekeepers along the Rhine reported that two-thirds of their bees had died following the application of clothianidin. In France, imidacloprid has been banned on sunflowers since 1999 and as a sweetcorn treatment since 2003, after a third of honeybees were wiped out. The Soil Association is calling on the environment secretary, Hilary Benn, to ban the pesticides in a letter sent today.</p> <p>Imidacloprid and clothianidin are produced by a division of the chemical manufacturer Bayer. Imidacloprid is its bestselling pesticide and is used in 120 countries. Bayer has always maintained that neonicotinoids are safe for bees if correctly applied. \"Extensive internal and international scientific studies have confirmed that neonicotinoids do not present a hazard to bees,\" Utz Klages, a spokesman for Bayer CropScience, said recently.</p> <p>The National Farmers' Union said it was opposed to any ban on pesticides. Paul Chambers, NFU plant health adviser, said: \"Banning pesticides using the precautionary principle is not based on good science. Pests and disease are the problems facing honeybees in the UK. The government needs to put more money into researching honeybee health.\"</p> <p>The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs also attributed the decline in honeybee populations to a variety of factors. A Defra spokesman said: \"There are no plans to ban pesticides.\"</p> <p>Beekeepers worldwide have reported catastrophic losses of from 30% to 90% of their honeybee colonies during the last two years. Two-thirds of all major crops rely on pollination, mainly by honeybees.</p>",
  "<p>'I didn't pick on the Pope,\" Sabina Guzzanti insists as she stirs her coffee. \"That was the only remark they hit upon in a 20-minute address. It made it look as if I delivered a speech to say the Pope's a poof.\" We are sitting at a table outside a cafe in the graffiti-covered San Lorenzo district of Rome, home to students and immigrants. Guzzanti is wrapped in an overcoat and scarf against the onset of autumn. The temperature has plunged to 22C.</p> <p>If ever there were someone who reaffirmed Dario Fo's vision of the comedian as heir to the deeply subversive medieval giullare, or jester, then it is this 45-year-old satirist with the face and air of a naughty, knowing elf. In Italy, she has been in and out of headline-grabbing controversies for at least 10 years.</p> <p>But this month she went global. On September 10, prosecutors in Rome asked for leave from the government to put her on trial, charged with \"contempt of the Pope\". Addressing a big leftwing rally in the Italian capital, the comedian had said: \"In 20 years [the former Cardinal Joseph] Ratzinger will be dead and will end up in hell, tormented by queer demons - not passive ones, but very active ones.\"</p> <p>Within 48 hours, her case had even worked its way into the US presidential election. Sitting alongside John McCain on Barbara Walters' morning talkshow, The View, the actor Whoopi Goldberg asked: \"Did you know that in Italy a comedian called Guzzanti risks five years in jail for a joke about the Pope?\" It brought howls of dismay from the live audience.</p> <p>Quite a few Italians, too, were shocked to discover that it was an offence in their country to poke fun at the pontiff. The offence was introduced in 1929 by a treaty between the papacy and Italy's then fascist dictator, Benito Mussolini. The treaty was revised in the 1980s and one of the changes was to remove the offence of which Guzzanti was accused.</p> <p>\"But in Italy there is this habit of passing lots of new laws and only seldom remembering to cancel the old ones,\" says Guzzanti. \"So the new ones and the old co-exist.\"</p> <p>On September 18, Silvio Berlusconi's justice minister decided the case should be dropped. By then, as Guzzanti observed, her critics and the Italian right in general had \"made a bloody awful spectacle of themselves to the rest of the world\". The affair gave outsiders a rare glimpse of the wackiness rife in the Italian legal system.</p> <p>But the fact that anyone should try to use a 79-year-old law of dubious validity to nail Guzzanti gives an inkling of the apoplectic rage she can inspire in her conservative compatriots. It may not be a coincidence that Guzzanti used the same rally to voice, in characteristically blunt fashion, a claim that had been hinted at in newspaper reports and talked about in bars across Italy. This was that Berlusconi had had an affair with his equal opportunities minister, a 32-year-old former topless model, Mara Carfagna, and that explicit evidence of their relationship had come to light in a telephone conversation recorded during an investigation into other matters. Berlusconi has denied the allegation and Carfagna threatened to sue Guzzanti, but has never done so.</p> <p>\"She didn't do so because I could have asked to read and bring to court the [transcripts] of the [telephone] intercepts,\" she says.</p> <p>Like many a giullare, the price of her jibes at the rich and powerful has been exile - not from the realms of an affronted prince, but from the kingdom of the mighty Silvio, Il cavaliere (\"the knight\"), as he likes to be called.</p> <p>Though most Italians have long come to accept it, his control of what they see on their television sets is flagrantly, and perilously, abnormal. Since being sworn in again this year as prime minister, he has had direct or indirect control of six of the seven channels from which the vast majority of Italians get their news and the other information on which they base their opinions. </p> <p>Not the least important thing about Guzzanti is that she embodies what this means. In practice, it is forbidden in Italy to give Berlusconi anything more than a gentle ribbing, or ask the really hard questions about how he obtained his wealth and power. That is precisely what she did on her TV programme five years ago when Berlusconi was last in power. It was taken off the air by the state-owned RAI after only two episodes. Lawyers for one of Berlusconi's companies then sued Guzzanti for \u20ac20m in damages. They did not win because the judge ruled that the things she had said about him on air were true. But she has never been allowed back onto RAI, except for the very occasional guest performance.</p> <p>The frustration that this must engender in a talented performer is sometimes given by others, particularly on the Italian centre-left, as an explanation for what are regarded as her vulgar excesses, such as her quip about the Pope. Understandably enough, the theory generally goes, she is trying to force herself back into the public eye.</p> <p>If you want to really wind up Guzzanti - if you want to see a glint appear in her eyes like a struck match - then all you have to do is set out this view. \"This is defamatory,\" she says. \"This is said by people who are very much against me and are the worst enemies of any sort of change. I can have visibility whenever it suits. I'm very popular, certainly a lot more popular than they are. If I take part in these rallies, it's not to get visibility. It's a complete bore going to rallies. It's always the same four of us from the arts who go. So really they ought to thank us because we have the courage to say what others don't, including those who write these shitty articles. Anyway, what I say is not outrageous. It's true.\"</p> <p>It is clear that Guzzanti holds the Pope in low esteem. Referring to his role as former head of a Vatican department in the sex abuse scandals that have rocked the Catholic church, she argues he had \"besmirched himself with several very serious offences\".</p> <p>But the reason, she says, that she had brought him into her speech to the rally in Rome was that she sees some aspects of the Vatican's conservative teaching as underpinning a \"rapid authoritarian escalation\" in Italy. She cites a string of recent incidents in which suspected far-right-wingers have beaten up gay people. \"The discrimination [in Catholic doctrine] against homosexuals - now that really ought to be an offence, especially if it provokes behaviour that is homophobic and violent.\"</p> <p>The row over her speech - and this is why Goldberg picked up on it - goes to the heart of a topical debate. Though issues of faith are becoming increasingly entangled with politics, many people of faith want religious institutions and their leaders to be accorded a special respect that is not conceded to, say, politicians. The prosecutors' application to indict Guzzanti can be seen as an attempt to establish that principle - one she absolutely refuses to honour.</p> <p>\"First of all,\" she says, \"what I was speaking about were the politics of the Pope. It's not as if I'd shot off my mouth on theological issues. It is the Pope who should have respect for our political institutions. At the point at which he gets involved in politics I have every right to criticise him for his political activity. Second, I am not even in agreement with the general principle. I believe that in a democracy there is no right not to be offended. I think that anyone ought to be free to say whatever he or she likes at any moment.</p> <p>\"If someone says things that are offensive, gratuitous and stupid, one has to assume there will be others able to demonstrate that what you said was offensive, gratuitous and stupid.\"</p> <p>For that reason, she is against the limitations on Holocaust denial. And the Danish cartoonists who ridiculed Mohammed? An instant's hesitation, then she says: \"I'm on their side.\"</p> <p>Rather than respect for religion, she says, what is increasingly evident is \"submission, fear\". Pussyfooting around someone else's ideas is tantamount to \"treating him like an idiot who can't bear to hear an opinion different from his own. That is not necessarily respect.\"</p>",
  "<p>Lewis Hamilton stretched his world championship lead to seven points yesterday as his main rival Felipe Massa's prospects of winning the inaugural Singapore grand prix evaporated in a Ferrari refuelling fiasco.</p> <p>The British driver's McLaren-Mercedes finished third behind his former team-mate Fernando Alonso, the Spaniard notching up Renault's first victory since he won in Japan two years ago. Splitting the old McLaren sparring partners in this night race held on a street circuit was Nico Rosberg, son of the 1982 world champion Keke, scoring his best ever result in his Williams-Toyota.</p> <p>The race unravelled spectacularly for Massa after he came in from the lead for his first refuelling stop after 18 laps in a flurry of pit-lane activity triggered by Nelson Piquet crashing his Renault, Hamilton following close behind.</p> <p>Amid his team's anxiety that he retain his lead over his McLaren rival, the Brazilian accelerated out of his pit with his car's refuelling hose still attached. He finally stopped at the end of the pit lane followed by his out-of-breath mechanics who ran up, cheered by the McLaren crew, and wrenched out the hose after considerable effort. To add insult to injury, Massa incurred a drive-through penalty for an \"unsafe release from a pit stop\" because he had almost collided with another car while leaving the pit with the hose. </p> <p>The McLaren principal, Ron Dennis, admitted that after the incident his team had recommended to Hamilton that he hold on to third place rather than push Rosberg for second. \"Today's race was a very exciting one,\" he said. \"In the last few laps we advised Lewis not to attempt to overtake Nico but instead settle for third and the seven-point lead in the drivers' championship.\"</p> <p>Hamilton, who once again drove a surprisingly mature race, agreed with the strategy. \"I honestly can't complain,\" he said. \"I didn't want to take chances, particularly because the Ferraris were outside the points. It is a good result, coming here for the first time and scoring points and finishing on the podium. I am looking forward to coming here again next year and maybe we can try to win.\" </p> <p>Hamilton now leads the world championship on 84 points, ahead of Massa, with 30 points still to be raced for in the remaining three races of the season in Japan, China and Brazil.</p> <p>It emerged later that Massa had been erroneously signalled back into the race by one of the pit crew, who was manually operating the green lights that signal to the driver whether it is safe to rejoin the race. These are normally electronically linked to the release handle on the fuel nozzle on the side of the car, so when the nozzle is uncoupled the green light automatically goes on. On this occasion, because Kimi Raikkonen in the other Ferrari was queuing behind Massa, the automatic signalling system was disconnected in order to speed up the process. The \"go button\" was mistakenly pressed prematurely and Massa moved off with the hose still attached, knocking over a team mechanic, Claudi Berscini, who was uninjured. </p> <p>\"It is hard to deal with losing a race in this fashion - a race that was within our grasp, with a car that was just the way I wanted it,\" said Massa. \"We had a good strategy and all the signs were there that we could get a one-two finish.</p> <p>\"But things can change in a moment and that is what happened today. At the pit stop one of the guys made a mistake. But we are only human. Each of us always tries to do our best and these things can happen. With the safety car on the track I did not lose a lap, but I got a drive-through penalty and later got a left-rear puncture.\"</p> <p>He finally went back into the race 18th but was then called back in to take his drive-through penalty, which consigned him to running right at the back. He finished 13th after starting from pole position. Raikkonen, the world champion, made the day even worse for Ferrari by crashing into a wall while running fifth with a handful of laps to go. </p> <p>\"A black day,\" said the Ferrari team principal, Stefano Domenicali. \"We had the potential to finish first and second but we didn't even pick up a point.\"</p>",
  "<p>When David Cameron gave his infamous \"hug a hoodie\" speech, he was signalling his willingness to show compassion for those members of society reviled by the mainstream majority. With the Tory conference now under way, we will find out whether the party is prepared to speak up for another group feeling victimised: bankers, City traders and hedge-fund managers.</p> <p>Traditionally, the Conservatives have always been happy to be associated with the City. But Northern Rock, the global banking crisis and the near collapse of HBOS has done terrible damage to the reputation of those working in this sector and now all politicians are having to recalibrate what they say about their friends in high finance.</p> <p>This was obvious at the Labour party conference when Ed Balls, the schools secretary, said that those who had made the case for \"light-touch\" City regulation had been intellectually \"routed\". The comment was embarrassing because it turned out that Gordon Brown put \"light-touch\" regulation at the centre of an action plan he published three years ago. Brown eventually tried to square the circle by saying that \"light-touch\" wasn't the same as \"soft-touch\".</p> <p>But for the Tories the problem is particularly acute. They have received enormous donations from the hedge-fund industry, which, because of its adherence to short-selling - the now-banned strategy that was used to drive down the HBOS share price - has been getting much of the blame for the crisis.</p> <p>Labour has received large donations from hedge-fund managers too, but the \"hedgies\" do seem to like the Tories. Big hedge-fund donors include Michael Farmer, co-founder of Red Kite Metals, who has given the party almost \u00a31.4m; Michael Hintze, head of CQS, who has donated \u00a3775,000; Hugh Sloane, of Sloane Robinson, who has given \u00a3184,000; and Michael Alen-Buckley, of Rab Capital, who has given \u00a3100,000. Hintze is also named in the register of MPs' interests as sponsoring two drinks receptions for Cameron and offering support to the office of shadow chancellor George Osborne.</p> <p>Osborne is due to address the Conservative party in Birmingham today. Boris Johnson - whose mayoral campaign was supported by Hintze and Stanley Fink, described as the \"godfather\" of UK hedge funds - recently urged his colleagues not to \"get carried away with neo-socialist claptrap\" and to speak up for the City, complaining that: \"Every lefty from Alex Salmond to Gordon Brown is queuing up to kick the 'spivs and speculators', who are apparently the authors of their own destruction, as well as the destruction of immeasurable wealth across Britain and the world.\" But a senior source says that Osborne's speech will \"give the lie to the idea that he's in the pockets of the City\". We'll soon find out.</p>",
  "<p>Big events create opportunities for big headlines - and that's been reflected in August's ABCe figures, which received a welcome boost from the Beijing Olympics. Certainly, the games seemed tailor-made for the interactive and live nature of the web. Team GB's amazing performance - and almost certainly the dire UK weather - managed to lift the normally quiet summer month online as people stayed indoors, obsessively refreshing pages to see who'd won the next race.</p> <p>That obsession most obviously helped the Guardian, which took advantage of the Beijing effect. That meant that theguardian.com remained the UK's biggest online newspaper for August, attracting 23.11 million global unique users last month, a 46% increase from August 2007 and up 12% on July this year. The Guardian added 2.5 million unique users last month and still has the largest number of UK-based online readers: 8.77 million or 38% of its total audience. </p> <p>Telegraph.co.uk also had a good month, with 22.05 million global unique users - a 125% year-on-year increase - of which 6.29 million were UK-based. The site put its lift down to the Olympics and the war in Georgia, but the start of the football season also probably helped, increasing interest in its popular online Fantasy Football game. </p> <p>In fact, all the quality newspaper sites did well out of their strength in sport, with Times Online moving from fourth to third place with 19.6 million unique users in August - an increase of 3.2 million on July, and a rise of 92.3% year on year.</p> <p>Independent.co.uk saw a rise of less than 1% from July to record 6,629,235 unique users in August, an increase of 90% from August last year.</p> <p>A few months earlier, of course, the driving forces behind online traffic were celebrity news about Lindsay Lohan's drugs battle, and the race between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama - with Mail Online hitting the top of the ABCe table for May, with 18.1 million. In August, the site came in fourth with 17.46 million global unique users - with 70% or 12.17 million of its users non-domestic - a 50.78% increase year on year. </p> <p>We got a taste of the sporty trend with July's ABCe figures, which showed that theguardian.com, Times Online and Sun Online all had a month of record-breaking traffic thanks to the sports-heavy summer schedule of Wimbledon, the Tour de France and England Test cricket.</p> <p>For the tabloids, the temptation of \"Olympic Soccer\" was possibly not enough to get visitors hammering their sites during August - so any gains from the Olympics were more modest. </p> <p>A relaunch for mirror.co.uk at the end of July helped its audience figures rise for August, with a total of 5.57 million unique users (56.7% of which are UK-based) and a month-on-month increase of 7%.</p> <p>Sun Online's traffic remained consistent with 15.98 million unique users in August (6.36 million in the UK) and a 50.89% year-on-year increase, but an unnoticeable change on its 15.97 million figure in July.</p> <p>So do we infer that a damp but sports-filled summer will translate into record figures going forward? Or was the summer Olympics a blip? </p> <p>Perhaps the Olympic spike can be seen as demonstrating growing acceptance that online is now the place to read breaking news, especially on subjects that are highly focused, such as the Olympics. In the internet industry this is known as the \"inch wide, mile deep\" effect, where the sheer mass of online content about a single subject beats anything broadcast or print media can deliver. Events such as the Olympics demonstrate the strengths of websites, which can gradually convert users to visiting them more.</p> <p>In addition to the Olympic spike, however, online audiences are also just getting bigger. In August the Office for National Statistics reported that 65% of UK households now have internet access, up from 61% in 2007. Some 1.26m homes have signed up for internet service in the past year, taking the total to 16.46m.</p> <p>Broadband penetration was up slightly over the last year to 56% of households, from 51% in 2007, while 86% of all homes with internet used broadband. Almost 57% of broadband connections had a speed greater than 2 Mbps - an increase from 52.3% since March this year. Historically, increasing broadband speeds has led to greater consumption of the web. </p> <p>Windsor Holden, principal analyst with Juniper Research, thinks the Olympics represents a \"definite, temporal spike in news site usage\". Much the same thing has happened during other major sporting or news events such as the World Cup or 7/7 London bombings. </p> <p>\"But it's also true that online usage per se is increasing,\" he says, \"so that while daily usage levels will fall back somewhat, the next major news event will see those spike levels exceeded. It will only be a matter of time before those levels experienced during the Olympics become the norm.\"</p> <p>\u00b7 Mike Butcher is editor of techcrunch.co.uk and is a former editor of New Media Age</p>",
  "<p>Mankind almost always gets threat assessment wrong. Politicians and sages worry themselves into a decline about a given issue - the red peril, the yellow peril, nuclear holocaust, al-Qaida - only to find themselves facing troubles of a different nature.</p> <p>The most obvious consequence of the western financial crisis is that it makes President Bush's \"war on terror\" seem footling. Of course terrorism is serious. But it does not threaten systemic disaster for western societies.</p> <p>By contrast, what generates such fear about the financial catastrophe is that nobody professes to know how bad matters can get. The US and British governments are scrabbling for palliatives rather than proposing anything that masquerades as a solution. Two months ago, economists were talking gloomily about 2009 being a bad year. Now, however, it seems plain that, even in a benign scenario, it will take much longer for the US and Britain to come out the other side of this nightmare.</p> <p>Thoughtful people are justly frightened about their jobs, homes and savings. Complacency persists only among those too stupid to realise how serious the mess is, or too young to imagine a society in which instant gratification is no longer available.</p> <p>My daughter once observed in a domestic context: \"Daddy, life is what you are used to.\" This seemed to me an unconsciously profound remark. In war or peace, people find it hard to come to terms with the notion of their own environment, physical, social or economic, becoming something quite different from what it is.</p> <p>Churchill, during the second world war, explained this phenomenon to the head of the army, General Sir Alan Brooke. He called it the \"three-inch pipe\" theory of human response. Human beings, he said, can only absorb so much drama - up to the capacity of say, a three-inch pipe. Thereafter, everything that happens around them rushes past, along an emotional overflow. </p> <p>Many people, including Brooke himself, experienced this in Britain in 1940. So many sensations crowded upon each other that many failed to achieve the impact that they deserved - happily for national morale.</p> <p>A little knowledge of history makes it easier to achieve a perspective upon misfortunes that befall us. Bedtime reading of Samuel Pepys's diary provides a wonderful corrective to anyone silly enough to suppose our own times extravagantly dangerous.</p> <p>Pepys lived and worked as a government servant, during a period in which almost everybody was frightened for their heads, health and fortune. While he shared in rejoicing at the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, throughout the years which followed King Charles II's polity never seemed less than precarious. Pepys's own career prospered at the Navy Office, but he lacked the slightest sense of security.</p> <p>In 1665, the great plague struck London. The following year, Pepys witnessed the great fire. The nation's finances tottered. The diarist wrote on September 8: \"Up, and ... by water to White-hall. I stopped with Sir G Carteret, to desire him to go with us and enquire after money. But the first he cannot do, and the other as little, or says: 'Where can we get any, or what shall we do for it ?' He, it seems, is imployed [sic] in the correspondence between the City and the King every day, in settling of things.\"</p> <p>It seemed to them all in those days that matters could scarcely get worse, but they did. The following June the Dutch fleet sailed up the Medway, and burned Chatham dockyard. Pepys, panic-stricken, sent his money out of London, and wrote: \"The truth is, I do fear so much that the whole kingdom is undone ... God help us, and God knows what disorders we may fall into.\"</p> <p>The crises of peace, precipitated by disease, natural disaster or financial collapse, are often harder to endure than those of war. People find themselves confined to the role of victims, impotent to influence their own fates. </p> <p>A significant element of Churchill's genius in 1940-41 was his understanding that the British people needed to feel themselves participants, rather than merely to stand passive in the face of the Nazi juggernaut. All that trench-digging and Dad's Army duty served little practical purpose. But it was invaluable in enabling ordinary people to suppose that they were \"doing their bit\". </p> <p>Long after the real threat of German invasion had passed, Churchill kept alive a pretence. He knew that defence against descending Nazi hordes sustained the illusion of useful activity among millions of British citizens who might otherwise have slumped into despondency and inertia.</p> <p>The most distressing British experience within memory was not the war, which offered notable compensatory stimuli, but the period that followed. In the late 1940s, food continued to be rationed. Fuel was desperately short. People suffered wretched privations during the snowbound months of 1947. </p> <p>The British were suddenly conscious that though they had been victors in conflict, they were big losers of peace. Their empire was fading away. American triumphalism and wealth contrasted with British bitterness and poverty. My father wrote me a letter at my birth in December 1945, which he later gave me on my 21st birthday, about the world as it then seemed. \"In my lifetime\", he said, \"this country has gone from being one of the richest nations on earth to one of the poorest.\" The grey, joyless austerity of the postwar period seemed monstrously unfair to British people who had sacrificed so much, to stand alone against the dictators. </p> <p>We need not continue the history lecture. My point is simply that, if we measure today's woes with those of former eras, we should be able to muster a little courage to endure the credit crunch. Western capitalism is suffering a richly deserved shock to its hubris. But it almost certainly possesses sufficient resilience, energy and imagination to come out the other side.</p> <p>We face no threat to our health, diet or physical safety to match those which confronted the generations of Pepys, Churchill and many others over the past millennium. If the worst that can befall us is to lose some money, then it ill becomes us to make too much of it.</p> <p>A few years ago, researching a book about Europe in 1944-45, I met in New York an enchanting old woman named Edith Gabor, who had survived several Nazi concentration camps. After spending three hours hearing her story, I stood on the pavement outside her apartment, waiting for a cab to take me to Kennedy airport, to catch a plane back to London. </p> <p>The cab did not come. I became first impatient, then emotional. Edith, a rotund little Hungarian Jewish octogenarian, came and stood beside me on the sidewalk. She laughed heartily. \"Relax!,\" she said. \"It's not important! When you've been in a death camp, you get to see that missing an aeroplane really doesn't matter very much.\"</p> <p>I felt ashamed to have displayed before such a woman a preoccupation with trivia characteristic of our incredibly privileged generation. The credit crunch is alarming. But, in the context of modern experience such as that which Edith Gabor knew, it really does not matter very much.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>This week we return to the subject of front pages and what should be on them. More clothing might please the reader who complained about nudity on the homepage of the Guardian's website a couple of weeks ago when visitors were presented with a man's bare bottom. </p> <p>The photograph was taken at the 2008 Venice Biennale, and the naked people in it were part of an art installation by Swiss architect Philippe Rahm, exhibited in The Arsenale shipyard (no pun intended), along with work by other prominent architects. </p> <p>The picture was part of a video and visitors who clicked on it were given a virtual tour of the exhibition, which included, very briefly, full frontal male nudity (thankfully that bit of the film was dimly lit). </p> <p>They also heard commentary from the Guardian's architecture correspondent Jonathan Glancey: \"This is just like going back to some sort of hippy stage show from 1968,\" he said of Rahm's work. </p> <p>The reader who complained about the picture has two young children. He describes himself as open-minded but he thought the image was too adult for the Guardian's home page. \"I was shocked to find images of pornography on your website,\" he said.</p> <p>I don't think of myself out as an expert, but this doesn't look like pornography to me. A naked woman is sitting on the floor, with her back to the camera, playing a xylophone. Her companion is lying on his side wearing nothing but a full head of hair and an unruly moustache. There's no getting away from his posterior, but the image is neither offensive nor titillating. </p> <p>Glancey was amused but unimpressed by Rahm's exhibit. \"It just seems to be very corny, very old-fashioned,\" he says in his video commentary. \"Architects are at their best when they're fully dressed, very serious and just a little bit uptight.\" </p> <p>From an aesthetic point of view the pose is familiar; this particular nude may not give the Rokeby Venus a run for her money but he wouldn't be out of place in art gallery either, which, is of course, where the naked people in this installation were hanging out. </p> <p>The image that appeared on the homepage was used, along with photographs of other exhibits, to illustrate Glancey's article about the biennale in the arts pages of the paper, but no one complained about that. No one has complained either that the video is embedded in Glancey's story on the arts site where it appears under the headline: \"Flesh in Venice: nude hippies, big blobs, stunning dog pounds - is the 2008 architecture biennale too wacky for its own good?\" </p> <p>Why was the video on the homepage? \"It was there because it's funny,\" the Guardian's head of multimedia said. \"I don't think it's shocking. It's a humorous look at the Venice Biennale and it skewers the pretensions of certain architects.\" </p> <p>The website has a different attitude to images of violence. Last week it posted the YouTube video, which showed the student gunman who killed 10 people at a college in Finland firing a handgun and saying to camera: \"You will die next.\" But in that case a decision was made not to embed the video on the front page. \"We are relatively relaxed about nudity, but not about violence,\" the head of multimedia said.</p> <p>A carefully chosen picture trail was used to promote the Finnish gunman film on the homepage and the video itself was posted elsewhere on the site with this note to users: \"Warning: Some viewers may find this film disturbing.\" Should the website have taken a similar approach to the Rahm video? </p> <p>Some indication that the image was from art installation and a warning that the video contained nudity might have been useful on the homepage where the video appeared under the heading \"multimedia\", and was completely detached from the environment of the arts (web and print) pages. Those sorts of measures don't interfere with the Guardian's liberal values and might be worth considering in future to avoid any confusion about the kind of content the website is hosting. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:reader@theguardian.com\">reader@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>There is common sense; and there is good sense. Common sense represents the received wisdom of years and the widespread opinion of the day. It may be rooted in fact, fiction, rumour or reality. On one level it doesn't matter. So long as it is commonly held, then, in essence, common sense becomes a fact of life. </p> <p>Good sense, on the other hand, represents those durable truths and stubborn facts that outlive their unpopularity. The fact that it is right does not necessarily mean that it is not marginal. It persists for the simple reason that prevailing conditions underpin its relevance even when prevailing opinion ignores it. </p> <p>At times the two coincide, at others they collide. At different moments in different places, burning witches, a flat earth, eugenics, slavery, smoking in restaurants and corporal punishment in schools were all common sense. But they were never good sense. </p> <p>\"Common sense is not something rigid and stationary,\" wrote the late Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci, who crafted the distinction from Mussolini's prison. \"It creates the folklore of the future, a relatively rigidified phase of popular knowledge in a given time and place.\" Good sense, he argued, was often concealed in common sense, but emerged primarily in times of crisis and transformation. </p> <p>We find ourselves in one such crisis now. As markets plunge, banks fail and traders panic, the core principles that have underpinned western economic and political culture for a generation have been thoroughly discredited. Less than a month ago the invulnerability and inviolability of unregulated global capitalism was common sense. The system that leaves half of the world living on less than a dollar a day, with some so impoverished that they are eating mud cakes and selling their children into bondage, was apparently working well. To suggest otherwise was to be dismissed as extreme. </p> <p>But such orthodoxies can collapse even faster than markets. By the end of last week the US treasury secretary Henry Paulson was literally on one knee before Nancy Pelosi, Democratic speaker of the House, begging her to save the bailout deal. Later George W Bush warned of the entire American economy: \"This sucker could go down.\" Suddenly, government intervention in markets, reining in executive pay and placing controls on the flow of capital are good sense. </p> <p>While the gravity of the crisis is clear, the prospects for transformation remain remote. The fact that this meltdown took place during a presidential election should be fortuitous. It ought to provide the two candidates with an opportunity to lay out different visions of how they would tackle the situation at a moment when the nation is intently focused on politics. If ever the country needed leadership, it is right now. And here are two men vying for it. </p> <p>Yet the financial crisis has, for the most part, made the presidential campaign seem less relevant, not more. The credit crunch and the election are taking place as though on a split screen. There is a connection between the two - Barack Obama has bounced back as a result of people's attention being refocused away from lipstick and pigs and back on to their mortgages, retirement accounts and jobs. But it is not a substantive one. For while the crisis has changed the electoral conversation, nobody is seriously looking to this conversation for new ideas, let alone a solution. </p> <p>The notion that there might be alternatives to rapacious capitalism have been all but banished from the public square. That limited discourse leaves us with limited options. Those who claimed that the government was the problem now cast it as not just the ultimate, but the sole solution. Good sense demands a thoroughgoing reappraisal of a system that's in a state of collapse; common sense requires we subsidise it in perpetuity for fear that it breaks down. That sounds like nonsense. </p> <p>\"If you beat your head against the wall,\" Gramsci once wrote, \"it is your head which breaks, and not the wall.\" Right now the American public has a terrible headache. And it doesn't seem as if this presidential race is going to cure it. </p> <p>For this election to make any sense at this juncture it must challenge the assumptions of the past 30 years that have led America to this place. They are assumptions that have been aggressively promoted by the Republicans in general, and George Bush in particular. But to gain traction they had to be first conceded and then embraced by the Democrats. The result is an American self-image rooted in unrivalled military superiority and economic might now stands in stark contradiction to a more tawdry and tattered reality. Add the credit crisis to defeat in Iraq and problems in Afghanistan and what you are left with is a sub-prime nation - overextended both militarily and economically, living large and beyond its means. </p> <p>It will be the task of whoever wins on November 4 to manage America's decline in status and power and a consequent further deterioration in Americans' standard of living. This process will be painful and could be protracted. Little wonder, then, that nobody wants to talk about it. Instead they keep talking of America as the shining city on the hill, without realising that the city they are referring to is bankrupt and the lights are about to be cut off. </p> <p>It was clear from Friday night's debate that neither John McCain nor Obama really know what to do. The little that they will commit to are things they agree on. Both stand at the mercy of events and the market. </p> <p>That does not mean it is irrelevant who wins. The difference between them on this issue may be marginal, but for now they are the margins within which we live, and in which many will have to survive. Back in 1932, in the midst of the Great Depression, many commentators lamented the lack of difference between Herbert Hoover and Franklin Roosevelt. One satirist wrote a searing piece about an imaginary match-up between Franklin Hoover and Herbert Roosevelt. \"Given later developments, the campaign speeches often read like a giant misprint, in which Roosevelt and Hoover speak each other's lines,\" wrote Federal Reserve chair, Marriner Eccles. Whatever slight difference there was rhetorically would prove to make a huge difference in reality during a vital period. It makes as much sense to elect McCain as it would have done to re-elect Hoover. </p> <p>McCain's response to government coffers depleted by the bailout isn't to rescind his tax cut but to freeze spending on everything but defence, veterans and entitlements - a military financial complex. Obama has conceded that his plans to expand access to healthcare, education and to make America energy-independent will have to be trimmed. Finally, the American political class has embraced a redistributive agenda. The trouble is they are about to divert public money from the poor to the bankers and financiers. </p> <p>\"Capitalists can buy themselves out of any crisis, so long as they make the workers pay,\" said Lenin. It is rarely regarded as common sense to quote him in polite company. Yet as a description of what is taking place right now, it is the most sense I've heard in a long time.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:g.younge@theguardian.com\">g.younge@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Airbus broke out of its European fortress yesterday when it opened a $600m (\u00a3325m) final assembly line for its best-selling A320 aircraft in China and committed to buy $1bn of locally made components by 2020.</p> <p>The plant, the most modern of its kind in the world, is designed to establish a foothold in China's booming aviation market, which is growing at 14.5% a year. Airbus executives said it would see orders for more than 3,000 new planes over the next 20 years as China develops the world's second-largest aviation market after the US.</p> <p>After an opening ceremony attended by premier Wen Jiabao and more reminiscent of a Communist party congress setting, John Leahy, chief operating officer (sales), said China could account for as much as a fifth of the more than 850 orders the European plane-maker expects this year.</p> <p>Leahy said Airbus, which has 450 planes on order in China, had a provisional agreement to supply a further 280 and he expected the Beijing authorities to approve up to 160 of these by the year's end. The new plant, he added, could mean that Airbus would capture more orders than Boeing.</p> <p>But he admitted that with western airlines facing takeover or bankruptcy and struggling to find capital for new planes, orders could take a dip in late 2009-10 and there could be cancellations. He insisted that several airlines had already secured funding for their current orders despite the credit crunch.</p> <p>The Chinese plant marks a new era in the history of Airbus, a 35-year-old European champion of engineering innovation and marketing expertise that has been riven by national rivalries, as it pursues its goal of becoming a global company with an international footprint on five continents.</p> <p>The plane maker, which has captured half the world market, plans to expand its presence in Morocco, Mexico, India and Russia. It has also targeted the US, where it will assemble refuelling tanker aircraft in Mobile, Alabama, if it wins a re-run Pentagon bidding battle against Boeing.</p> <p>Its plans, which will see 5% of the airframe of its new wide-body A350 jet produced in China and could see 10% of new-generation planes sourced from the people's republic, has awakened fears among its core British, French, German and Spanish workforces that Airbus is turning its back on Europe. </p> <p>Unions, which have reluctantly accepted 10,000 job cuts, are worried Airbus will switch more output to low-cost countries in the weaker dollar zone.</p> <p>Tom Enders, the chief executive, told the Guardian: \"We have 95% of our employment and 75% of our procurement in Europe, and politicians and unions would like to keep it that way but it can't. </p> <p>\"Airbus would make a huge mistake if it locked itself into Fortress Europe. The bulk of employment, procurement and all innovation will stay in Europe - and the US.\" </p> <p>The British plant at Broughton, Flintshire, will lose its status as the sole supplier of wings for all Airbus planes as Chinese manufacturers will provide the wings for the A320 single-aisle jets made at Tianjin. Airbus said Broughton would retain an innovation cutting-edge in wing design for new planes.</p> <p>The new plant, employing up to 600, will assemble four A320s a month from 2011 - compared with 40 a month in Hamburg, the model for the Chinese line. Airbus indicated it could eventually produce the A320 replacement, due in the next decade, and Enders did not exclude the possibility that Airbus would cooperate in Chinese plans to build their own aircraft.</p> <p>\"But we are not gate-crashing their project,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Echoing Alastair Campbell's famous line to journalists on Tony Blair and religion, Ofcom chief executive Ed Richards last week declared: \"We don't do frustration.\" But just about everyone else in the industry it oversees has plenty to be frustrated about as the regulator grinds through the gears of its long-running review of public service broadcasting. </p> <p>Ofcom itself could also be frustrated by the behaviour of broadcasters and a sense of its own impotence. Phase two of the Ofcom review, published last week, is characteristically thorough and thoughtful, but changes little after positing three ideas for consideration - evolution of the existing model with ITV and Five maintaining PSB obligations; the BBC and a publicly-funded Channel 4 with limited competitive funding; or a broad competitive funding model. </p> <p>Some funding options that were ruled out in the leaked \"storyline\" document obtained by MediaGuardian in July - including the idea of imposing industry levies on ISPs, MP3 players or televisions - have been put back on the table. Handing over a stake in BBC Worldwide is infinitely preferable to losing control of a portion of the licence fee for the corporation, particularly if it can be branded as a BBC \"partnership\" initiative. Hence that goes back in the pot too. </p> <p>The shift in tone could have resulted from the new mood music coming from the department of culture, media and sport. Culture secretary Andy Burnham has been quick to make clear that it is for Ofcom to do the research and deliver the options, and for government to make the decisions. </p> <p>\"Ed and I have a really good relationship. We are each clear about our different roles. I look to Ed and Ofcom to advise me about the options,\" says Burnham, diplomatically. \"But questions of public service broadcasting quite rightly fall to parliament - they go to the heart of our democracy and our country. Ultimately, it's our call.\" </p> <p>Increasingly, there seem to be two debates going on. One is highly detailed, heavily researched, technocratic argument among regulators, broadcasters and policy wonks. There, broadcasters bicker and brief against one another and the regulator while novel notions such as introducing a sales tax on iPods are discussed. </p> <p>Meanwhile, back in the real world, the fate of the media industry is sliding down the agenda of both the government and the public as the first teeters on the brink of implosion and the other grapples with the consequences of a global economic meltdown. Against that backdrop the fate of Channel 4, never mind the introduction of a new competitive funding mechanism to maintain plurality in regional news, starts to look like small beer. </p> <p>But the debate couldn't be more real for the 500 ITV employees who face the axe after plans to cut regional news services were rubber-stamped by Ofcom. The strong regional flavour that was ITV's USP - and which Burnham said on Friday he still held dear while pining for the days of the late Tony Wilson - is gone for good. There are rumours of even heavier job cuts at ITV, and last week Channel 4 announced 150 job losses and \u00a3100m in cuts over two years as the advertising downturn compounded its structural woes. </p> <p>Burnham attempted to cut through the rhetoric in a speech to the Royal Television Society's International Conference on Friday. Belatedly admitting that it was time to speed up the process, he promised answers by January and legislative action shortly afterwards. </p> <p>It was an attempt to answer the nagging questions that have been swirling around since the beginning of the latest review. Namely, will Labour have the political will to get any necessary legislation through before a general election? And WWDD? That's What Will Dave Do, if and when the Tories get in? In an interview with MediaGuardian following his speech, Burnham attempted to quell those fears. There would be not necessarily be any need for primary legislation to plug the funding gap facing public service broadcasting from 2012, he suggested, adding that time was of the essence. </p> <p>He promised that the government had the will to help but seemed to make it clear there would be no new money put into the system, despite Ofcom estimating a gap of between \u00a3145m and \u00a3230m, including C4's share of up to \u00a3100m.</p> <p>Instead, he proposed a \"new deal\" with the industry. Essentially: stop squabbling, work within your existing means and I'll do what I can to push the chosen plan through parliament. \"I'd like the industry to come together and say this is the right thing to do. What's important is sensible cooperation. I'd like to underline that phrase two or three times,\" said Burnham. The promise comes with a threat: \"The degree of consensus I am presented with come January might then dictate the speed with which we can make changes. If it is a polarised picture, it will spill over into the political debate in parliament.\" </p> <p>There are those at senior levels within the BBC who still believe Ofcom has it in for the corporation and is hell-bent on getting its hands on the licence fee. Richards looked exasperated, but not always convincing, as he spelled out for the umpteenth time his conviction that taking the \u00a3130m so-called \"surplus\" licence fee and redistributing it would not weaken the BBC's \"core programmes and services\". Meanwhile, senior Channel 4 executives continue to believe that the BBC is playing its own game and is not entirely serious about its offers of help. Asked whether he felt any ideological reluctance to sharing the licence fee, Burnham said: \"In any scenario, I would want to see a strong BBC. I am ideological about that.\" </p> <p>The BBC director general, Mark Thompson, pointedly dismissed any of Ofcom's future models - suggesting that none of them held the answer - and proposed his own \"new deal\" in which the corporation, not the regulator or any other new body, was at the heart of maintaining plurality. In a speech on Friday that appeared designed to blind-side Ofcom and align Burnham's aims with the BBC's, he insisted that sharing its assets, expertise and technology with other broadcasters could amount to more than warm words. </p> <p>He said the BBC was making \"significant progress on a set of tangible and economically significant initiatives\" to help its fellow PSBs. </p> <p>\"We need a better debate about the future of public service broadcasting. Less spin. Less certainty that the regulatory levers are the only levers to achieve the right result. Less sitting back and waiting for the politicians or somebody else to ride to the rescue,\" he said. \"We need to work together to give this unique, sometimes slightly wayward, ultimately very precious system of ours a great future.\" </p> <p>But Burnham's Tory opposite number, the shadow culture secretary Jeremy Hunt, is not convinced by Burnham's posturing and believes he is no closer to making his mind up. </p> <p>\"This isn't something for party political point-scoring. Public service broadcasting is a bit like the constitution, it needs a broad consensus and it's part of our culture. But I have to say I'm disappointed. You could end up with a situation where they won't make a decision until the next election and it could fall onto my plate,\" he says. \"The trouble is, if you listen to Andy Duncan, he doesn't think Channel 4 can survive that long.\"</p> <p>Hunt, who insists that he is against privatising Channel 4 and wants to maintain a strong PSB system but is still eyed with suspicion by those who remember the last Tory government, adds: \"I'm very nervous. There has to be plurality of provision so that it's not just the BBC. We may not have the time to sit on our hands any longer. It would be a tragedy if, through dithering by the government, they end up going to the wall.\" </p> <p>And even if Burnham does come to a quick decision, suggests Hunt, he will still have to convince his boss. \"Andy may say that the decision is going to be his, but actually it's going to be Gordon Brown's. You're not going to be able to just pick a solution off the shelf, the culture secretary is going to have to sell it to the prime minister.\" </p> <p>Even so, between Ofcom's release of its thoughtful, expansive but ultimately frustrating 155-page document on Thursday and Burnham's speech 24 hours later, the game changed. \"We've been stuck for too long in the broad options. This is not the time to focus on distractions. There really needs to be a bit of realpolitik and a sense of getting the job done,\" Burnham told MediaGuardian. \"There is a recognition of the urgency within government. I am asking the industry to work with me.\" </p> <p>All of which rules out all but the most politically expedient and practical remedies and leaves spectrum reallocation, BBC assets and the so-called \"surplus licence fee\" the most likely bargaining chips. It's clear that Ofcom's more complicated funding suggestions will fall by the wayside. This is likely to lead to yet more frustration at Riverside House.</p> <p>Already, Ofcom has gone from proposing a a revolutionary new intervention (the Public Service Publisher) to essentially yoking itself to Channel 4 to preserve plurality in the digital age. This new cry for pragmatism and practicality further restricts its room for manoeuvre. </p> <p>A process that has meandered along for five years may be concluded in a matter of months. Both Richards and Burnham kept repeating the mantra that they retained \"an open mind\". They will have to start making some tough decisions, and fast. In a year's time, Burnham promised the future shape of the PSB landscape would be clear - one way or another: \"I don't want to be at another Labour party conference debating the future of public service broadcasting. This is the end game.\"</p>",
  "<p>Tributes to the epic Hollywood career of Paul Newman, who appeared in his first film more than half a century ago, flooded in over the weekend, praising his dedication to fundraising for charity, the civil rights movement and motor sports. </p> <p>The death of the 83-year-old actor at his 18th-century farmhouse in Connecticut after a protracted battle against cancer severed one of the few remaining links with the legendary era of black and white cinema. </p> <p>His lack of conceit and reluctance to exploit his fame for personal gain earned him the appreciation of fellow professionals, film critics and politicians on both sides of the Atlantic.</p> <p>Robert Redford, his veteran fellow star, said at the weekend: \"There is a point where feelings go beyond words. I have lost a real friend. My life - and this country - is better for his being in it.\"</p> <p>Sir Michael Parkinson, who interviewed Newman for a documentary, said he was \"one of the very finest screen actors\" of our time. \"[Newman] spanned the gap between the golden days of Hollywood, the 40s and 50s with actors like Cary Grant and James Stewart and Clark Gable, and the present lot represented by Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise,\" he said.</p> <p>Parkinson described Newman as \"quiet, reserved and suspicious\": he had been deeply affected by the death of his only son, Scott, from a drug overdose in 1978. </p> <p>Sam Mendes, who directed Newman in the 2002 film Road to Perdition, remembered it as \"the highlight of my professional life\". </p> <p>Mendes said: \"It seems to me to be one of the great 20th-century lives: he was famously generous, with his extraordinary and unstinting work for his charities, he was a passionate advocate for the adrenaline and danger of his beloved racing cars, he was a shining example of how to use global fame for the greater good, and most of all he was one of the great movie actors of this or any other age.\"</p> <p>As well as establishing a foundation to finance anti-drug films in memory of his son, Newman set up summer camps for terminally ill children paid for by sales of personally endorsed food products. </p> <p>He was nominated 10 times for an Oscar, winning best actor in 1987 for The Colour Of Money. He received an honorary Oscar in 1986 and won a third in 1994, the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, for his charitable work. </p> <p>His best known roles included playing alongside Robert Redford in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) and The Sting (1973). He starred with his second wife, Joanne Woodward, in several films including Long Hot Summer and Paris Blues; they had been married for 50 years.</p> <p>During the 1960s and 70s, Newman supported civil rights protests and went on anti-Vietnam war demonstrations.</p> <p>In later life his enthusiasm for racing came to the fore. As a driver, Newman's career highlight was his second place finish in the Le Mans 24 Hours race of 1979. </p> <p>As team owner of Newman/Haas, his squad claimed eight Indy/Champ Car titles. Former formula one world champions Nigel Mansell and Mario Andretti were among the drivers. </p> <p>Ron Dennis, formula one's McLaren chief, said: \"[Newman] was a fine driver, who was famous in Hollywood for doing his own stunt driving as often as not.\" </p> <p>Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, even hailed him as \"a great friend of France ... the fans of motor racing will remember his successive appearances at the Le Mans 24 Hours race\".</p> <p>Arnold Schwarzenegger, governor of California, said: \"[Newman] entertained millions in some of Hollywood's most memorable roles ever, and brightened the lives of many more, especially seriously ill children, through his charitable works.\" </p> <p>In a joint statement, Newman's five daughters from his two marriages said: \"Our father was a rare symbol of selfless humility, the last to acknowledge what he was doing was special.\"</p>",
  "<p>Aware it was never going to be the UK's biggest mortgage bank, Bradford &amp; Bingley chose to specialise. A concerted lending push combined with a policy of buying hundreds of millions of pounds of existing loans transformed the onetime sleepy building society into Britain's biggest buy-to-let lender. It won 18% of this fast-growing market last year.</p> <p>A voracious appetite for these loans gave the project a sense of urgency and concerns about the likely risks of many ending in arrears were brushed aside. \"The arrears figures show that, despite some recent reports, the credit profile of buy-to-let remains extremely strong with no increase in the rate of repossessions,\" the company said in February last year.</p> <p>With low interests rates, fierce competition among mortgage providers and house prices climbing ever higher, the buy-to-let goldrush captured the public imagination. Buy-to-let mortgages rose from 120,000 eight years ago to 1.1m last year. But in the last 12 months the picture has changed. The global credit crunch has brought with it increases in the costs of mortgages and house prices have fallen 12.7% in the last year. </p> <p>Often taking on large amounts of debt, newer entrants to the buy-to-let market now look vulnerable. Worse still, many such investments are in new-build flats that have seen the steepest falls in value. Some have halved in value.</p> <p>Last month B&amp;B said the number of its loans that had slipped more than three months into arrears had increased by 55% in the previous six months. Repossessions were up 27%. City analysts noted B&amp;B's arrears figures were double those of other mortgage lenders. Moreover, they estimate 40% of its loans could be in negative equity if house prices lose 30% of their value.</p> <p>B&amp;B has not, as yet, experienced the same kind of pressure on its mortgage financing as Northern Rock. In fact, its capital base is among the strongest of a UK bank. Nevertheless, despite a \u00a3400m rights issue over the summer, the company's market value has been shrinking at an alarming rate. At the end of last week there were growing whispers that B&amp;B depositors were losing confidence and withdrawing savings.</p> <p>The demise was yesterday greeted with exasperation by some. Peter Montagnon, director of investment affairs at the Association of British Insurers, whose members control almost a quarter of the stock market, said: \"We understand the need for action ... but it is a matter of concern that a bank with one of the strongest capital ratios in the sector should have become a casualty.\"</p>",
  "<p>A third runway at Heathrow airport would be scrapped by a Tory government that would instead build a \u00a320bn TGV-style high speed rail link between London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds.</p> <p>In one of David Cameron's boldest moves on the environment, the party will today unveil plans to cut 66,000 flights a year from Heathrow by tempting passengers on to the first new rail line north of London in more than a century.</p> <p>Theresa Villiers, the shadow transport secretary, told the Guardian last night: \"This is a seriously green decision. A few years ago it would have been inconceivable for the leader of the Conservative party to say no to a third runway and putting the brakes on Heathrow expansion.\"</p> <p>The announcement, on the second day of the party's conference in Birmingham, is designed to show that the party has not abandoned its \"Vote Blue, Go Green\" agenda in the face of the economic downturn. Gordon Brown has warned that some Tory green plans would jeopardise economic development, but Cameron hopes to blunt any Labour attack by outlining detailed plans to tempt airline passengers on to the railways.</p> <p>Villiers will announce that a Tory government would spend \u00a315.6bn between 2015 and 2027 (\u00a31.3bn a year for 12 years) to build the new high speed rail link from London St Pancras to Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. A further \u00a34.4bn would be paid by the private sector.</p> <p>The line would be completely new and would allow the existing West Coast main line to be used for commuter journeys between smaller towns, such as Macclesfield, Stafford and Milton Keynes, and the big cities. There would also be a high speed line linking St Pancras with Heathrow.</p> <p>Journey times on the 180mph line would be slashed: London to Birmingham would take 45 minutes instead of 80; London to Manchester 80 minutes instead of 125, London to Leeds 97 minutes instead of 125 and Manchester to Leeds 17 minutes instead of the current 55.</p> <p>The Tories say the new rail link would cut flights from Heathrow by 66,430 a year - 44% of the capacity of the planned third runway. There are currently 36 flights a day between Heathrow and Manchester. The Tories hope to cut flights to Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels as passengers are encouraged to use the new high speed rail line which would link up with the Eurostar service at St Pancras.</p> <p>Greenpeace last night welcomed the announcement. John Sauven, its executive director, said: \"The Conservatives have recognised that decisions taken now on high carbon projects like new runways and coal-fired power stations will make or break our chances of tackling climate change in the future.\"</p> <p>The government has resisted pressure for a high speed rail link on the grounds that money should be spent on upgrading existing lines.</p>",
  "<p>Humiliation can be both instantaneous and enduring, as Scott Carson knows to his cost. Recovery is a more gradual process but the West Bromwich Albion goalkeeper took a step towards rebuilding a reputation for reliability at the Riverside. While memories of Niko Kranjcar and Croatia obstinately refuse to fade, Saturday provided a reminder of why, at 22, Carson was briefly deemed his country's best young goalkeeper.</p> <p>Mido, Afonso Alves and Gary O'Neil could all testify to his talents, though Carson downplayed his contribution to Albion's first away win of the season. \"I made a couple of good saves but I thought everyone else did really well,\" he said. \"People keep asking me if I am suffering from an England hangover but it was 10 months ago and I'd like them to let it go. My priority is playing well for West Brom; I'm not really thinking about England.\" Others are, including his manager. Tony Mowbray argued that Carson's swift rise to prominence was reason enough to purchase him. \"He obviously was outstanding to get into that position,\" he said. </p> <p>The blend of confidence and camaraderie that comes from long-term security is on the prescription Mowbray has written to revive Carson's career. He explained: \"I'm trying to create an environment where he's happy. He needed a home and we've given him that to create that stability in his life. Scott's a lovely lad, a very grounded individual who fits into our culture very well. He's enjoying coming into training every day with a smile on his face and he's playing with players who appreciate his talent.\" </p> <p>A serial loanee at Liverpool, Carson moved to the Midlands for \u00a33.25m and believes he is benefiting from the permanence of a longer-term deal. \"I settled in pretty much straight away,\" he said. \"I feel like I'm one of the lads now. They got me involved in the banter straight away.\"</p> <p>One of Mowbray's lower-profile additions was the other match-winner. Making his third Albion appearance, Swedish defender Jonas Olsson stabbed in from close range after Ross Turnbull spilled a corner and Ishmael Miller located his team-mate with an ungainly overhead kick. Thereafter, as Carson said: \"It was backs against the wall.\" Albion's expertise at last-ditch defending surprised; Olsson and two Dutchmen, Ryan Donk and Gianni Zuiverloon, all exchanged the Netherlands for the Black Country in the summer. An array of blocks were evidence of total commitment, if not total football. </p> <p>For Middlesbrough it was all too typical as familiarity bred discontent. This is the same old story, and one with an unhappy ending for a team who cannot finish. \"We don't seem to be punishing teams when we're on top. We missed an awful lot of chances and conceded a sloppy goal,\" said O'Neil. \"A lot of keepers playing against us are getting man of the match and that just sums up our luck. How we didn't score, I don't know.\" Carson's form provided one explanation, along with the bar, rattled by an Alves drive, and James Morrison, who twice cleared off his own line. </p> <p>So it made for a profitable return to Teesside for three of Middlesbrough's alumni. Albion manager Mowbray and captain Jonathan Greening were joined by Morrison, who belied his delegated role as the supposed support striker to prosper as the last line of defence. Middlesbrough's experience, however, was that reunions are not always joyous affairs.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Scott Carson (West Bromwich)</p>",
  "<p>The government was this morning expected to nationalise buy-to-let lender <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bradfordbingley\">Bradford &amp; Bingley</a>, as the global credit crisis deepened with the giant European banking group Fortis also being partially taken into public hands late last night.</p> <p>But even as governments stepped in to rescue the two institutions there were hopes that an apparent agreement by the US Congress for a $700bn bail-out for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/wallstreet\">Wall Street </a>would draw a line under the deepest financial crisis since the Depression.</p> <p>After a weekend of frenetic activity in London and Washington, chancellor Alistair Darling last night convinced Spanish bank Santander to buy B&amp;B's 200 branches and \u00a322bn of savings, but he will now take \u00a341bn of mortgages into state hands. Santander will have more than 1,200 UK branches, as it owns Abbey and is taking over Alliance &amp; Leicester.</p> <p>In the US, treasury secretary Henry Paulson declared \" I think we're there\", after horse-trading by the Bush administration finally removed opposition by both Democrats and Republicans for the taxpayer to take \"toxic\" investments owned by banks. Both presidential candidates, John McCain and Barack Obama, said they supported the package, toughened up with help for homeowners facing foreclosure and curbs on executive pay.</p> <p>The US treasury would get an initial $350bn to buy mortgage-backed securities, and sell them later for the best possible prices. Last night, there were signs the House of Representatives might vote today, with the Senate later in the week.</p> <p>The crisis spread to Belgium where Fortis, its biggest private employer, became the first big European casualty of the credit crunch. Last night a deal was reached between EU and national banking officials and Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg ministers; the three governments will pour \u20ac11.2bn into the bank.</p> <p>In London, sources said the government was not preparing any UK \"Paulson plan\", although Darling is taking on \u00a341bn of B&amp;B mortgages as well as \u00a3100bn of Northern Rock mortgages. While the outline of a B&amp;B deal was done by lunchtime, talks went on last night to try to minimise risk to the taxpayer amid fears that billions could be added to Britain's worsening national debt. An announcement will be made before the London stockmarket opens at 8am today, after a weekend trying to avoid the confusion of Northern Rock, which took five months to nationalise.</p> <p>Central banks were last night ready to inject liquidity into financial markets at the start of a make-or-break week for banking. Fears of fresh casualties last week sent interbank rates, the borrowing costs banks charge each other, soaring, and left Darling mounting the second emergency operation for a UK bank in a fortnight after HBOS was taken over by Lloyds TSB.</p> <p>The Treasury realised on Friday that B&amp;B had no independent future and tried to persuade a handful of major banks to make a full takeover. None would. Bidders were last night asked to tender to process the mortgages taken into state hands. Treasury chief secretary Yvette Cooper admitted the stability of the entire banking system was at stake. She told the BBC: \"We've been very clear the priority is to make sure that depositors, that ordinary savers, will be properly protected, but also that we can support the stability of the banking system as a whole.\"</p> <p>David Cameron last night opposed nationalisation of B&amp;B, saying it was wrong \"to throw the whole thing on to the taxpayer\", and proposed alternative methods to rescue ailing banks as well as powers to control asset-lending ratios of individual banks to avoid failure.</p> <p>Shadow chancellor George Osborne will use his party conference today to accuse Gordon Brown of presiding over 10 years of debt: \"We racked up more than a trillion pounds of mortgages and credit card bills and households debts, and the government never stopped to think ...

Copying and piracy is still a serious issue, it is not a new one, but it continues to evolve. It is clear that pirates cannot always be beaten, so why not join them? As other entertainment industries have demonstrated, online distribution does not always equate to loss of revenue. If games publishers were prepared to approach online distribution with the same level of innovation they bring to game development, consumers will be able to play for free while the industry continues to profit.<br>Ariel Napchi, HIRO Media</p> <p>Thank you for such a great article this should be an inspiration to other game makers and music industries aswell as those who have large budgets employing hundreds of people. Here is the way to resolve the difficaulties of piracy after all we are all wanting the best value for money for our entertainment why should it be more expensive than absolutly necessary. If only more thought were put to resolving piracy this way then only the best game producers ets would be in the industry.<br>Tom Balm (by email)</p> <p>&gt;&gt; Given changes in technology and formats, I think a nosedive was inevitable for music.

It will, I am prepared to suggest, lead to more, not less piracy. Also, following the documents one finds that the real beneficiaries were the ISPs who charged tens of thousands of pounds in fees. Not a good way to make friends - especially if you have already hacked them off by suggesting you will introduce Phorm (boo! hiss!)<br><a href=\"http://blog.david.bailey.net/blog/_archives/2008/9/11/3879973.html\">blog.david.bailey.net</a></p> <p>&gt;&gt; I'm with the pirates on this, though. Most games are just not worth the price. Usually it's because they were thrown out to the market before they were what they could have been because of the time constraints the publishers put on the developers. It's not just a product, it's an art in its own right. and the fact they have to \"hollywood\" the industry for pure profit turns them into what they're not, toys. It's like rushing out a book, it just ruins the story when you have to cut content and revise the vision it was intended to be, all for the sake of $$.<br><a href=\"http://www.applegeeks.com/blog/2008/09/13/how-i-learned-to-love-game-pirates/\">applegeeks.com</a></p> <p>&gt;&gt; Seems to me if it's illegal, it's illegal.

Having seen it on You Tube I am surprised that you are so baffled by it. As you say it's a teaser, so it doesn't have to do much. Isn't it just a brand-awareness ad with some weirdness thrown in? Pretty straightforward, Guinness-like above the line promotion of Microsoft as something other than the mercenary masters-of-the-universe that most of us think them to be.<br>This is Microsoft as cuddly, fun, off-the-wall, masters of self-effacing mirth. There are several references which are not entirely clear, but it never hurts to have a thoughtful Spanish speaker, even if they do think Bill (or is it Jerry?) may be a conquistador. Jerry mentions several times that Bill is a Ten with it's (admittedly 30 year old) associations with Bo Derek, Hollywood etc - but never dis Hollywood. I'm not sure what snack they are eating, but it gives Bill the opportunity to say \"I'm good\" - how subtle is that? And, assuming it is some bread based foodstuff, the ancient Roman metaphor of keeping the populace under control by giving them 'bread and circuses' is lurking there somewhere... and so on, and so on.<br>Other more obvious themes and messages include:<br>...associating uber-rich geek, Bill Gates with the very popular Jerry Seinfeld. Just because we don't get his show on UK TV doesn't mean it isn't being aired constantly somewhere on US TV (They're still watching I Love Lucy, for God's sake ). Celebrity endorsement works - and nobody really hates Jerry.<br>...showing Microsoft as whacky, not geeky, and shows Bill as being up for a bit of self parody, foolishness and surrealist imagery, always a good move in the commercial world if your principal reputation concerns world domination. Banks do it all the time.<br>...introduces the edible computer as desirable object and hints, through Bill's adjustment of his shorts, that it is to come and presumably that it will be delicious<br>...and then associates the notion of Delicious with Microsoft and other good things in the foreseeable future, probably software, because we suspect that the edible computer is unlikely to be a big seller anytime soon.<br>.. and finally you are writing about it and now you've got me at it.<br>Being able to find some logic in the ad does not mean that I think it is the best way to spend a squillion dollars. Personally I think the advertising agency should read your last line as it sums up exactly what Microsoft ought to be doing with this campaign. I speak as someone who spent way too long removing Vista from a new PC to install XP so I could use the damn thing without having to learn a new operating system. I know I will have to address the idiosyncrasies of Vista sooner or later, unless I jump ship and get a Mac. But the thought of having to start using Vista when XP is good enough is just too scary at the moment.<br>Richard Paul-Jones, Brighton</p> <p>&gt;&gt; Chairman Bill is using Jerry Seinfeld to try and connect with real people using Windows Vista. Sad to say, the ads aren't working for me.<br>On a side note, Bill Gates is aging well. Better than Steve Jobs, anyway.<br><a href=\"http://rightonblog.com/2008/09/12/bill-trying-to-connect/\">rightonblog.com</a></p> <p>&gt;&gt; Personally, I think [ad agency] CPB could extend this campaign making it more global and show that Microsoft are listening to all customers around the world. Microsoft divide their regions into two separate areas: G7 and G29. It would be great to show Jerry and Bill understanding the other G7 countries that Microsoft spends a lot of money in: Australia, UK, Asia, etc. I can already imagine the token ads for each country, but they would show Microsoft was listening.<br><a href=\"http://dominiquehind.wordpress.com/2008/09/14/missed-opportunity-for-microsofts-new-ads-jerry-seinfield-bill-gates/\">dominiquehind.wordpress.com</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/sep/11/computing.research\">LHC, HELLO</a><br>As I am sure you are well aware this project is receiving a great deal of attention lately and, as a result, I have read a large number of articles on the subject.

  "<p>It was peanuts compared with the billions discussed every day in reports of the global financial crisis, but \u00a31,500 from the Bradford and Bingley meant a lot to local nurse Caty Hollis and her three children.</p> <p>Their primary school's new playground project was rescued by this unexpected grant, having just missed out on money from a local good causes fund earlier this year.</p> <p>\"It helped to make sure we reached the target,\" said Caty, whose friends among the parents at Priestthorpe primary in Bingley include some of the 1,400 local B&amp;B staff now waiting for news about their jobs. Although the small town in the Aire Valley has diversified and prospered in the last decade, the bank is still the biggest local employer, by a stretch.</p> <p>\"Quiet, reserved anxiety,\" is how Bradford's former Conservative leader Margaret Eaton sums up the resulting mood in the villages around the town which form her Bingley Rural ward. \"We've all been conscious of it since the problems earlier this summer with the share issue,\" she says. \"It's not exactly on everyone's lips, but when you meet anyone and get chatting, sooner rather than later the state of the Bradford and Bingley comes up.\"</p> <p>That's certainly true on the streets of the town, where billboards chart the latest developments \u2013 usually with question marks attached. \"It's that not-knowing that worries you most,\" says Pam Greenwood, out for a stroll to the most celebrated landmark, the five-rise locks on the Leeds-Liverpool canal. \"The town's very healthy these days, with the market doing well and a new shopping centre coming, but we need this credit crisis to settle down, and to know what's happening to the building society.\" (Nearly everyone in Bingley still calls the bank a building society, as it was for 149 of its 157 years).</p> <p>Eaton's colleague Robin Owens, who represents Bingley Urban ward on Bradford council, agrees. He says: \"There's nothing worse than uncertainty, and that's what we've been stuck with. It looks better today, with this talk of a takeover, but I've been watching the TV news and I can't yet make sense of what's likely to happen.\"</p> <p>There's some immediate comfort for Bingley in the actual creation of 70 new jobs at the bank's HQ, even if they are for specialists in collecting bad debts. Eaton, who has just become the first woman chair of the Local Government Association, is also upbeat about the wider local economy.</p> <p>\"Bingley's a town of hustle and bustle nowadays,\" she says.</p>",
  "<p>Troubled Belgian-Dutch financial group Fortis may sell itself or the ABN AMRO Dutch banking business it acquired last year, a Dutch financial daily reported on Sunday.</p> <p>\"The sale of ABN AMRO is being considered,\" the Financieele Dagblad reported on its Web site, citing an unnamed source.</p> <p>Fortis's problems stem from its purchase last year of ABN AMRO with partners Royal Bank of Scotland and Spain's Santander in a \u20ac70bn (\u00a337.92bn) deal just as the credit crisis struck, slashing the value of banking assets.</p> <p>Fortis has been weighed down by its \u20ac24bn outlay in a market that is neither conducive to more of its capital increases nor willing to pay handsomely for the assets it wants to sell.</p> <p>In London, regulators were in talks on the future of troubled lender Bradford &amp; Bingley, raising the prospect that a second British bank could be nationalised.</p> <p>BNP Paribas is a potentially interested buyer for all of Fortis or just ABN, while Dutch rivals ING or Rabobank may be eyeing Fortis's private banking business, the Dutch newspaper added, citing unnamed sources.</p> <p>Belgian daily De Standaard said on its website that BNP and ING were favourites to buy all or part of Fortis, with investment bankers already advising.</p> <p>Fortis sought on Friday to reassure investors that it was solvent and in no danger of collapse following market talk the company could become another casualty of the credit crisis.</p> <p>As its shares plummeted more than 20% to 15 year-lows on Friday, Fortis called an emergency news conference to say its position was strong and that it would expand asset sales to as much as \u20ac10bn to raise cash.</p> <p>Core members of Belgian prime minister Yves Leterme's cabinet met for two hours late on Saturday for a briefing with Belgium's financial regulator, the Banking, Finance and Insurance Commission (CBFA) and the central bank.</p> <p>Financial authorities have contacted a number of institutions, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters on Saturday, although there was no preferred solution.</p> <p>The stakes are high in Belgium, where Fortis is the biggest private sector employer and where over 1.5m households, roughly half the country, bank with the group.</p> <p>The CBFA and the central bank were examining initiatives to restore confidence in Fortis, with a decision and likely announcement in the late afternoon or evening, a CBFA spokesman said. Dutch counterparts were also working to resolve the Fortis crisis.</p> <p>The Dutch central bank (DNB) chief Nout Wellink, a European Central Bank governing council member, cancelled a trip to Chicago to return to the Netherlands.</p> <p>After a fifth straight day of share declines, Fortis also on Friday named a new chief executive, nominating banking chief Filip Dierckx, 52, to replace interim CEO Herman Verwilst.</p> <p>Financial players around the world were hoping that US lawmakers would sign off on a deal on Sunday to create a $700bn (\u00a3380bn) government fund to buy bad debt from ailing banks in a bid to stem a credit crisis threatening the global economy.</p>",
  "<p>The Conservatives have had a wonderful year since their last conference, when they deterred Gordon Brown from calling an election in November. Apart from the wobble of the past week - which is probably attributable to Labour's usual <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2008/sep/25/polls.labour\">post-conference bounce</a> \u2013 the Tory vote has been hitting a stable and high level <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/polls\">in the mid-40s</a> since spring 2008. That's well ahead of anything they've managed since 1988, and an election-winning position. David Cameron's personal approval ratings are more variable, but on this measure as well there is no cause for complaint. Their local and London elections in May demonstrated real electoral progress. The party has also recorded its first byelection gain since 1982 in Crewe and Nantwich and seen off a Liberal Democrat challenge in Henley.</p> <p>So what could possibly go wrong at Birmingham? Now the prospect of a Tory government is being taken so seriously, the Conservatives can expect a greater degree of scrutiny from the broadsheets. Another risk will be bandwagon-jumping from interest groups and lobbyists who wish to become on better terms with the potential next government. Conference will have a busier, more glossy and hectic feel than in the past, which will fuel the feeling that the Conservatives are on their way. The risk is of premature hubris.</p> <p>Winning is a considerable benefit in the struggle for party unity. The 2006 conference, which was at the softest and most listening phase of Cameronism, saw some subtle displays of different priorities: tote bags bearing tax-cutting and anti-EU slogans were carried around conference. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives2007\">Last year's conference</a> became a festival of unity, despite sub-surface misgivings within the party, because of the pressure generated by the mishandling of the election announcement by Number 10. An imminent election concentrates minds. In 2008, the sense that they are on the way and the Cameron strategy is working will mean that there will not be much by way of public dissent. The party's self-presentation has also shifted a bit to the right, with recent pronouncements on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/31/conservatives.davidcameron\">obesity</a> and other issues rooted in a traditional Conservative emphasis on personal responsibility. The party has also rowed back from some previous proposals for reform or consensus, such as the composition of a revised Lords. This suggests confidence in their ability before long to implement an undiluted Conservative agenda.</p> <p>However, there are still a few tensions. One is quite how far it is permissible to go in painting a negative picture of the state of Britain. Oppositions always have to judge whether they will be hurt by the allegation that they are \"running down Britain\". Cameron's frequent references to a \"broken society\", while striking a responsive chord with mid-market newspapers, seems hyperbolic to many other commentators: it does not match up with the reality of life as it is mostly lived. The phrase was criticised by none other than the principal Conservative executive politician, Boris Johnson, who called it \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2008/aug/19/borisaccusescameronoftalki\">piffle</a>\", but it remains a Conservative campaign theme and no doubt we will hear it from Birmingham. The Cameron team has essentially absorbed the particular definition of \"social justice\" promoted by Iain Duncan Smith since 2003.</p> <p>The Tories' plans and policies are at a late but nowhere near final stage of evolution. They have, however, a more pithy overall narrative than the other two parties. Policy areas have been grouped into three \"agendas\": giving people more opportunity and power over their lives; making families stronger and society more responsible; making Britain safer and greener. It is not a bad narrative, but the detail is lacking and where it is spelt out (as, ironically enough, over the promotion of apprenticeships) it is sometimes not that different from Labour's. Like a lot of political rhetoric, the Tory slogans are banal. Who would say they were for giving people less opportunity and power over their lives, weaker families and a more irresponsible society, and a more dangerous and dirty Britain?</p> <p>While the economic downturn has helped the Conservatives to achieve their current position of dominance, it also risks undermining their policies. The likely recession's effect on public finances may make the sums cease to add up (if indeed they did to start with), and the priorities of the public shift during recessions (as Labour found when its policies, conceived in the boom of 1988-89, looked less appropriate in recessionary 1992). The oil price spike has also exposed some contradictions between different strands of Conservatism, with potentially different free market, environmentalist and populist responses. The Conservatives have gone for the populist \"hard pressed motorist\" line \u2013 a possible sign that Cameron's initial emphasis on the environment has shallow roots. </p> <p>Indeed, in some ways the <a hre=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">financial crisis</a> undermines non-interventionist ideology that has driven the party. They still have little coherent to say about how the key institutions of capitalism should work. Gordon Brown last week at least had the start of a narrative of how to respond to the crisis. The Tories' basic ideology is, if not bankrupt, at least trading under Chapter 11, and they are vulnerable because of their inexperience.</p> <p>However, while policy is somewhat difficult, Cameron's position is extremely strong and he can stamp his authority on the party at this conference. Emerging from the conference season with polling numbers back in the mid-40s and their poll lead recovered would be enough to rally the party's confidence.</p>",
  "<p>Discussions of another new world order are debating a pseudo-proposition, largely a western one. The events of August 8 that triggered this discussion, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics2008\">Beijing Olympics</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/georgia\">Russia-Georgia conflict</a>, revealed nothing new about the international system. The two key actors, China and Russia, have always been great powers, a fact that has been gravely neglected and underestimated by the west. </p> <p>A great power can be defined as a country that exerts great influence on regional or global systems. It cannot simply be measured by GDP, PPP or GDP per capita. Even when it is mired in destitution or isolation, its innate strengths, rooted in territory, population and culture, can still radiate its energy outside. Given the nature of great power politics, there are several principles that should be underlined. First, these powers deserve respectful treatment because they cannot be neglected: every move they make impacts on international order. Second, certain lines must not be crossed when dealing with them; one should not attempt to subvert their internal order, hope they crumble, nor push them into a corner, because it will inevitably cause chaotic or violent consequences and suffering for all involved. Finally, they must be urged to follow their obligations on the international stage \u2013 in an increasingly interconnected global village, great powers have even greater responsibilities.</p> <p>At the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/09/olympics2008.openingceremony\">opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics</a>, the world watched a \"new\" China, a powerful, civilised and modern China. Some in the west may have been shocked, even frightened. But such a reaction only reflects poor knowledge and deep prejudice. For thousands of years, China has been a great nation with a large territory, huge population and splendid culture. In the last century and a half, it has been trying to find its way towards modernisation. And during the past three decades, China has engaged with the international community and achieved great success. Yet until the Olympics, it was still unfairly portrayed as a closed, backward and totalitarian state by the western media, China-bashing on every issue from Darfur and the Dalai Lama to human rights.</p> <p>At the same time, the conflict in South Ossetia showed the world the re-emergence of Russia as a military might. Many people were shocked too by Russia; western public opinion sympathised with Georgia, ignoring the fact it provoked the conflict. The deeper root was the longterm squeeze by Nato, with an enraged Russia responding to protect its strategic space and vital interests with military force. In the post cold war years, the US and the western world apparently underrated Russia's capability as a traditional great power \u2013 not to mention underestimating its national pride.</p> <p>Twenty years after the collapse of the Berlin Wall, the world seemingly became used to the unipolar hegemonic order of the US. Under the banner of freedom, democracy and universal values, the neoconservatives' logic of benevolent hegemony and promoting democracy appeared perfectly justified. According to Francis Fukuyama's analysis, the essence of neoconservatism is two myths: that democracy is the nostrum for almost every problem in the world, from poverty to terrorism; and that military power can be used to hasten the pace of democratisation. This logic has been sternly criticised during the Iraq war; but few have questioned it when those same attitudes are applied to China and Russia.</p> <p>The post-Olympics China has to confront a few economic and social obstacles, and continue to explore its way towards social transformation, political development and improved international relations. Russia, regardless of South Ossetia, remains a great power, with its military capability, huge energy resources and political leverage. The events of August have not transformed the international power structure: the existence of these two great powers has only been overshadowed by the myth of a unipolar world. But the events are a chance for the west to recognise the reality of the current world order. By according the status due to powers such as China, Russia, India, Brazil and others, it will encourage these countries to exert a constructive influence on the world.</p>"
