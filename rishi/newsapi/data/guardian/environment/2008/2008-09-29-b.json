  "<p>The government's renewable power strategy is \"ineffective and very expensive\", according to a damning review by the International Energy Agency.</p> <p>A study of 35 countries, including all the major industrial nations such as the US, Germany and China, puts the UK near the bottom of the class on green energy.</p> <p>While ministers like to boast that the Britain leads the field, Paolo Frankl, author of the IEA report and head of renewables, believes its overall record is poor.</p> <p>\"We estimate that, in 2005 terms, it [British green power] costs around 13.5 US cents per kilowatt hour over 20 years and registers 3% on our effectiveness indicator. This compares with costs below 10 cents and effectiveness of almost 12% in Germany,\" said Frankl, author of Deploying Renewables: Principles for Effective Policies.</p> <p>Frankl said the UK had not improved in relative terms since then. \"Things may have changed but I would not say drastically, especially compared with countries which have changed and become very efficient such as Spain and Portugal.\"</p> <p>In overall terms, the renewable power sector in the UK was \"ineffective and very expensive\". That could be attributed to administrative problems such as getting connections to the National Grid and winning over communities to support windfarms and other schemes.</p> <p>Britain ranked 31st in the cost league of 35 countries, prompting criticism from environmental group Greenpeace. </p> <p>\"Our renewables industry has been left to wither on the vine while our European neighbours have raced ahead, creating new jobs as well as fighting climate change and securing their energy supplies,\" said Jim Footner, senior climate campaigner at Greenpeace. \"The Department for Business must urgently ditch its obsession with coal and nuclear, and focus properly on the true technologies of the 21st century.\"</p> <p>The Department for Business said it had not seen the report but could take comfort at not being the only one singled out for criticism. Too few countries had implemented effective support policies for green energy to be in a position to meet G8 goals of providing 50% of global energy supplies and helping halve carbon output by 2050, said Nobuo Tanaka, executive director of the IEA.</p> <p>\"Governments need to take urgent action ... Setting a carbon price is not enough. To foster a smooth and efficient transition of renewables towards mass market integration, renewable energy policies should be designed around a set of fundamental policies, inserted into predictable, transparent and stable policy frameworks and implemented in an integrated approach.\"</p> <p> Frankl's report argues that there are \"significant barriers\" to swift expansion and which increase the costs of accelerating renewables into the mainstream.</p>",

This is a good thing. But if this were just a group show, what would it be about? History and place, art and life, object relations; there's a depth and complexity here that, it would be nice to think, might overtake the usual chat about winners and losers. </p> <p>Some chance. In 2007, it was clear that Mark Wallinger should win - both on the strength of earlier work and on the film he exhibited, which had Wallinger wandering Mies van der Rohe's Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin in a bear suit. The ghost of Mies returns again in the work of 2008 nominee Goshka Macuga, who includes several sculptures shown in the Neue Nationalgalerie earlier this year. </p> <p>Macuga's installations invariably quote and even include the works of earlier artists. She appropriates them in order to tell her own stories, as well as theirs. Here she focuses on Mies and his partner and collaborator, Lilly Reich, an often overlooked figure who stayed in Germany when Mies emigrated to the US in 1938; and on British modernist artists Paul Nash and Eileen Agar. The two pairs of lovers are at the heart of Macuga's installation, where a gentle shower of graphite strokes, a light pencilled rain, falls across the walls. This is rather beautiful. </p> <p>Also on the walls are several framed assemblages of photographic and other material, all sourced from the Tate's archive, in which Macuga makes collages out of copies of photographs and other ephemeral papers by Nash and Agar, who had a long affair during the 1930s and 40s. A photograph of Agar in a bathing suit has been pasted on to a Nash photograph of tree trunks. She is oblivious to the axe planted in the timber behind her head. In another image, she reclines in a landscape of wrecked bombers. One of Agar's strange watercolour figures walks across another Nash shot, a botched photo of a country cottage enveloped in foreboding shadow. More simply, it looks as if Nash's thumb got in the way.</p> <p>There are intimations of disaster and war and love gone wrong everywhere, but it is all held in a kind of stilled suspension. Macuga's sculptures, with their planes of tinted glass and polished steel rails, are derived from exhibition display stands designed by Reich. They display nothing, and are stripped back to pure sculptural form. But they beg a kind of use, to be leaned on or stood within and peered through, and have about them a sense of emptiness and absence and possibility. All this is oddly moving. </p> <p>Trauma and wretchedness whack you in the face as soon as you walk into Cathy Wilkes' I Give You All My Money. One approaches gingerly. The space is brightly lit. A shop mannequin sits on a lavatory, cross-legged, elegant and naked, but for her nurse's hat and lots of things draped and dangling from her head - rusty horseshoes, a cup, charred bits of wood, a seashell, a deflated balloon. She doesn't seem to notice. A second mannequin leans against one of two full-size supermarket checkout counters. Ash is smeared on her face; her head is enclosed in a birdcage. Life is stupid and awful. These are Stepford Wives who have discovered the truth, and it isn't funny. </p> <p>As is usual in Wilkes' tableaux, there is a lot of stuff one wishes wasn't there. That's like life, too. Bowls and opened jars smeared with food litter the checkout counters, each with a plastic spoon; all the spoons point in the same direction. There's a stove and other bits of homely detritus. I don't know how to read the half of Wilkes' installations. Unless, that is, I'm thinking too hard. Inarticulate stumbling towards meaning is part of her subject, and a way of speaking. Literature and theatre deal with this all the time. Wilkes' art is a poke in the eye, a sort of curse. She goes on and on doing the same thing, and her insistence is telling and painful.</p> <p>Runa Islam has three film installations here, and more new work at White Cube in east London. The conjunction seems to me to be more than coincidence, and is perhaps overkill. </p> <p>Islam is an impressive film-maker, who takes as much care over the presentation of her films as of what goes on up on the screen. In a tasteful pale green room, we watch a nice young woman smash to bits the kind of crockery my parents had. Tea spills like blood. The texture of the film is reminiscent of a Good Housekeeping photoshoot, circa 1960, the atmosphere redolent of repressively correct behaviour. Smash! Islam also returns to Dhaka in Bangladesh, where she was born, to film rickshaw drivers resting beside a deserted avenue. And she films the workshop of camera motion-control pioneer Harry Harrison, who worked on Lord of the Rings, in New Zealand. </p> <p>Islam's own mechanically controlled camera searches Harrison's workshop, the camera movement spelling out the word CINEMATOGRAPHY as it works its way around the space, scanning shelves and stairs, a man at his workbench, tangles of cable and satisfying piles of hardware, all to the sound of whirring motors. The changes of pace and atmosphere in each of these works are impressive; Islam's real purpose is to talk about looking itself, about the mechanisms of film and the eye's desire - to look, to see, to possess, to enter the image. </p> <p>A 40-minute film of a lecture given at Tate Modern and the Guggenheim museum in New York dominates Mark Leckey's show. Leckey, suave in evening dress, delivers his peroration on images and objects, on Philip Guston's \"thick-as-a-brick\" paintings, on deformed feet in Georg Baselitz, on cats, on James Cameron's movie Titanic, on Marx's \"All that is solid melts into air\", and a great deal more. Like Macuga, Leckey often co-opts other artists into his work. A compelling and plausible speaker, he is by turns erudite and iconoclastic, and a bit too slick - too much the performer to be utterly believable. This is a risk lecturers often run. The camera drifts in and out of the proceedings. I find myself taking notes. What we are watching is a \"cinema in the round\", just like that fish-eye view of Leckey's studio reflected in the bulging steel surfaces of Jeff Koons' Bunny - an image that appears in Leckey's 2004 film Made in 'Eaven. The world is full of distorted reflections and false images.</p> <p>Leckey is currently a professor of film studies at the St\u00e4delschule in Frankfurt, where Daniel Birnbaum, one of this year's Turner prize judges, is director (and where, I might add, two earlier Turner prize winners are also professors). I have never warmed to Leckey's art until now. What I like here are the busy conjunctions of slide projections, films and models (including one of his studio), and the daring of his cinema-in-the-round, its range and humour - though it lacks Islam's sophistication, Macuga's reticence, Wilkes' directness. </p> <p>But I'm not entirely convinced by Leckey or Wilkes, who seems to me to fall for the obvious too often. Who should win the Turner prize? What do we want from art? These are the questions, and they may be incompatible. Macuga has the best installation here, but, as a body of work, the films of Islam take a lot of beating.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The <strong>Turner prize </strong>exhibition is at Tate Britain, London SW1, from today until January 18.

  "<p>Dagenham's Becontree Estate was built between 1921 and 1932. Created thanks to David Lloyd George's drive for \"homes fit for heroes\", its 27,000 homes made it the world's biggest public housing project, and its ambience seems caught between the facelessness that comes from its mind-boggling size, and the remains of an idealism that Britain might do well to revive. </p> <p>These days, you can make out the enduring signs of another historic watershed: the one that began in December 1979, when the freshly elected Conservative government published the housing bill that enshrined council tenants' right to buy their homes, and commenced what was, arguably, Thatcherism's most popular scheme: what Michael Heseltine - then the secretary of state for the environment - called \"one of the most important social revolutions of the century\". Nearly 30 years on, its legacy is instantly revealed by the estate's front doors. Council-supplied models come in five designs, which are all soberly traditional; if you are a home-owner, you are more than likely to have joined in a quiet riot of stained glass, pastel colours and ornate door-knockers.</p> <p>Ken Collins, a 57-year-old former bricklayer, bought his house in the early years of Right to Buy: in 1982 or thereabouts, when council houses in Barking and Dagenham were being sold at the rate of around 2,000 a year. \"I knew it was going to be cheap,\" he says. \"I paid \u00a312,750. It's worth \u00a3350,000-plus now. But it's more than doubled in size.\" With evident pride, he points at the side of his house to the right of the front door. \"You've now got an extra bedroom downstairs, an extra bedroom upstairs, and the kitchen-dining room goes right across the back - 33ft. It's got an extra five rooms now. And they're big rooms.\" Even after all that work, his garden is still big enough to contain a handsome vegetable patch. Better still, it backs on to a neatly trimmed park, King George's Field. </p> <p>\"Once houses started to be sold,\" he says, \"people felt better about living here. People looked after where they lived more. And they were more interested in what was done to the rest of the place. Basically, it made it a more pleasant place to be.\" Squinting into the sun, he points at the other houses on the street and quietly utters words that you hear a lot round these parts: \"That one's private, that one's not, that one's private, that one's not.\" A few minutes later, he considers one last question: how did taking advantage of the Right to Buy make him feel about Margaret Thatcher?</p> <p>\"As a person, I didn't like her. Some of the things she did I thought were very good; some of the things were crap. I thought she was right about the Falklands, for one. And she was right about this, definitely. You wouldn't recognise this place compared to how it used to look 20 or 30 years ago. It was an absolute tip.\"</p> <p>Such is what remains of Right to Buy evangelism: the idea that ownership breeds responsibility in a way that tenancy never can, and the collectivist delusions of the past were best swept away by the property-owning democracy. To be fair, to thousands of people who bought their council houses and flats, their experiences do speak powerfully about the way that home ownership can transform lives, and embody what politicians now call aspiration. But in the midst of all the upbeat stuff, there are other stories that have not received nearly as much attention, often focused on what happened when the first generation of ex-tenants sold up and moved on. </p> <p>Though New Labour has not been as gung-ho about it as the Tory governments of the 80s and 90s, Right to Buy still remains one of the many post-Thatcher shibboleths that very few mainstream politicians dare to question - and at the blunt end, the way it was pursued can easily look disastrous. Proof of its negative impact regularly trickles into the news, but rarely seems to catch the eye of the right people. Yesterday, for example, saw the publication of a report put together by National Housing Federation and the Campaign to Protect Rural England, highlighting the fact that the selling of council houses is as much of an issue in the countryside as in our towns and cities: with nearly 700,000 people now on housing waiting lists in rural England, the report called for restriction of the Right to Buy \"in rural areas of acute housing pressure\".</p> <p>In 1979, 42% of the British population lived in council housing. These days, the figure is a mere 12%, with another 6% renting their home from housing associations and cooperatives. Between 1980 and 1996 alone, 2.2m homes were bought by tenants who became what the jargon termed \"owner-occupiers\" - and, give or take the property slump of the early 1990s, thousands of them became the beneficiaries of rising house prices. </p> <p>Tim Lott's 2002 novel Rumours of a Hurricane is an affecting portrait of how politics can occasionally define the plotlines of people's lives, founded on a married couple named Charlie and Maureen Buck, and a rise-and-fall story that runs in tandem with the Thatcher years. Go to page 210, and there it all is: in 1981, Lott writes, Maureen had \"wanted to stop Charlie buying the council flat for fear of debt. But Charlie talked her into it ... They had doubled their savings without any work being done. It was extraordinary, money for nothing. It went against some inherited, deep-rooted idea of how the universe worked, but there it was all the same.\" </p> <p>Underneath such miracles, unfortunately, there lurked all kinds of drawbacks. When councils sold properties - at discounts of up to 50% - they were legally obliged to use the money to pay off debt rather than to build replacement homes. The results of such restrictions were not hard to predict: as Shelter had forecast in 1979, the supply of what we now call social housing fell way behind demand, and we ended up where we are today: according to official figures, four million people are waiting for either a council or housing association home, and the number is expected to rise to five million by 2010.</p> <p>In the meantime, other consequences of the Right to Buy started to rear up. As the writer Lynsey Hanley points out in Estates, her masterful memoir-cum-housing history, by the mid-90s, \"95% of those housed by local authorities qualified for some form of means-tested state benefits\" - the root of the modern reinvention of \"council estate\" as a byword for deprivation and stigma. At the same time, a mess of problems resulted from what happened when the first ex-tenants sold their homes, and some of the worst aspects of the private housing market rose to the surface. Though no one in high political office seemed to be paying much attention, housing thus became a huge modern issue; certainly, in the past half-decade, the dysfunctional state of official policy in this area is arguably the key reason why immigration has become such a highly charged subject.</p> <p>Barking and Dagenham is an incisive case study in all this. Prior to Right to Buy, two-thirds of the homes here were owned by the council, which had one obvious upshot: though the profusion of privately rented housing elsewhere in Greater London accelerated its postwar passage into a multiracial society, the residence qualification for council housing meant that Barking and Dagenham remained largely white. In the wake of Right to Buy, however, there came a massive transformation. A stock of 40,000 council properties was reduced to 18,000, and the vast majority of the homes that were sold were houses. Over time, ex-council properties were sold on by their owners (often to private landlords), and migrant workers flocked to what was now the cheapest housing market in Greater London. In response, people born and raised locally decried the fact that they had no hope of the provision their parents had taken for granted, and soon enough, along with the decline of the local Ford factory that was once Europe's biggest car plant, it all fed into the political sea change for which the borough is now famed: 12 of its councillors are currently drawn from the British National party.</p> <p>The day I pay a visit, my guide is 35-year-old Liam Smith, the Labour deputy leader of the council, who is not only in charge of housing, but is himself a council tenant, with a fierce belief that council housing needs to be rehabilitated and revived. </p> <p>\"The good thing about Right to Buy,\" he tells me, \"was that it allowed people who couldn't have moved out of Barking and Dagenham to move out of the borough, and to further themselves. Some people might say it's also allowed people to borrow against their house, and give their children something, especially with tuition fees having come in. But the problem is that it's turned out to be like cod-fishing in the sea. Sometimes, you have to stop and replenish your stock. What we've done is fish, fish, fish, fish, to the extent that council houses have become an extinct breed.\"</p> <p>There are, Smith tells me, 9,000 people on the borough's waiting list for social housing. He also explains the scourge of what he calls \"landlordism\": private houses, including ex-council properties, being bought by landlords who then put locks on individual doors, and stuff them full of migrant workers and their families on short tenancies. As Smith puts it, this amounts to \"kids being pushed around from pillar to post, and homes that don't meet decent homes standards, and people living in Dickensian-style accommodation. A lot of them are vulnerable people, so they're hardly likely to be complaining about it. They're scared.\" </p> <p>On top of all that, he says, there is the insanity of a practice known as Private Sector Leasing: councils putting families deemed to be emergency cases in ex-council properties, owned by private landlords who charge them as much as \u00a3300 a week for places they once rented out for less than a third of that. So much money can be made out of this wheeze that in many London boroughs, property firms have been known to leaflet and cold-call council tenants, offering cash enticements for them to use their Right to Buy on the companies' behalf. In some cases, this has come with a particularly cynical twist: for the first 14 years of Right to Buy, any ex-tenant selling up within three years of buying their home had to pay back their discount, so property companies encouraged them to simply move out, get their upfront cash bonus, sub-let their property back to the firm, and then sell it to them once the time was up (one such leaflet, issued circa 2004 by a firm called London Investment Properties Ltd, features a picture of a man with a wad of dollar bills, and the offer of \"\u00a35,000 to \u00a320,000\"; they last filed accounts in 2006, and there was no reply when I called their listed numbers).</p> <p>In response to these pretty nasty practices, the Housing Act of 2004 extended the discount period from three years to five, which seems to have dealt them a sizable blow. </p> <p>Within all this intrigue, there is one particularly sharp irony: that contrary to the idea that Right to Buy would lead to some idyllic future of gleaming houses and perfectly tended gardens, the pushing of so much property on to the lower end of the private rented market means that too much if it has been left looking remarkably shabby and unkempt. </p> <p>\"That's happened over the past 10 years,\" says Smith. \"After Right to Buy, I can remember properties that straight away had lovely Georgian-style windows, crazy paving on the drives, nice brickwork - these little villas popping up everywhere. They looked fantastic; I can remember walking past, thinking, 'I wish I lived in a house like that.' I look at them now: they've changed hands two or three times, and they look dishevelled. People don't take pride in them, because you've got this six-month transit-camp situation. There's no community cohesion, the neighbours don't know each other ... Overall, if you took a sample of 100 properties and 50 were council and 50 were privately owned, I would guarantee you that the council properties would be in much better condition.\"</p> <p>Just about everything Smith says is backed up by plenty of other testimonies. That afternoon, for example, I meet Rita Giles, who has lived in her three-bedroom council flat for 32 years. Ruled out of the Right to Buy bonanza by the fact that her late husband's chronic diabetes made it all but impossible to get a mortgage, she has stayed put, and watched as a once-solid neighbourhood has been replaced by an ever-changing community of people who often appear to be simply passing through. </p> <p>\"The people who bought the properties don't live in them any more,\" she says. \"This is the biggest problem. They buy them, they do them up, then they sell them, and they get rented out. A lot of them go and live abroad.\" One of her neighbours, she tells me, bought his flat, paid off his mortgage, and eventually retired to Cyprus.</p> <p>\"Now,\" she says, \"you might have two or three families in one three-bedroom flat. I've seen that happen on our estate. We get a lot from Africa. A lot of short-term people come from Kosovo. The problem is, any sense of community is utterly eroded. Once, you could walk down the road and everybody who spoke to you, you'd know who they were. People still speak to me: they'll say 'Good morning', and I'll say 'Good morning' back, because it's in my nature to do so. But I couldn't tell you who they are, because with 95% of them, it's the only time I've seen them, and I might not ever see them again. They just disappear.\"</p> <p>Among those who have watched all this happen, one word from the housing vernacular is repeated more than most: \"transience\". The day after my trip to Barking and Dagenham, it comes up once again, when I make my way much closer to central London and visit the Peckwater Estate in Kentish Town: a mid-20th-century complex of seven-storey blocks that sits just behind the tube station. I have come to talk to Alan Walter, a council tenant, the chair of the national pressure group Defend Council Housing and a local community organiser, and Rose Goldberg, who bought her second-floor flat in the mid-80s, chiefly to \"have something to pass on to my children\", and has watched as the after-effects of Right to Buy have radically altered where she lives. </p> <p>As Walter sees it, in the early years of Right to Buy, \"Mrs Smith still lived next to Mrs Jones\", those who bought their flats were in a small minority, and the estate's atmosphere felt much the same as ever. \"But as more places have been bought, and more and more have changed hands, you've ended up either with absent landlords renting them to people they cram in on short tenancies, or people who've bought solely to get on the housing ladder and have a very short-term perspective on how long they're going to live here. And, again, they have very little commitment to the community.</p> <p>\"You see some people moving on to estates who are holding their noses,\" he says. \"They've probably spent six months agonising about it and trying to convince themselves they can do better, and then they decide it's the only way of getting their foot on the ladder.\" In addition to the kind of problems evident in Barking and Dagenham, such is yet another of Right to Buy's regrettable legacies: ex-council homes being thrown on to central London's overheated housing market, priced way beyond the means of people in the direst need, and then talked up in the property sections of national newspapers. Underneath that phenomenon, meanwhile - and when you are unpeeling the long-term consequences of Right to Buy you often get the sense of a socio-political Russian doll - there lurk practices that are altogether more illicit. There is anecdotal evidence, for example, of people in central London either being so reluctant to give up precious council tenancies that they unofficially sub-let on a cash-in-hand basis - or in the case of the truly desperate, both council and private tenants simply selling their door-keys for cash. Either way, such arrangements only add to the problems of once-stable communities that are now constantly in flux.</p> <p>Unfortunately, even if you take the official route to living in an ex-council property, the promised security and peace of mind may still elude you, particularly if you buy an ex-council flat rather than a house, become what is known as a leaseholder, and leave yourself open to yet another post-Right to Buy scourge: the habit of some councils of levying sky-high charges for building improvements. For tenants, building work can result in incremental charges or rent increases, but when it comes to the leaseholders who live alongside them, demands for vast lump sums can leave some people with no option but to call time on their dream of home ownership and reluctantly sell up.</p> <p>On the 16th floor of a high-rise block off the Harrow Road in central London, I spend an hour talking to 44-year-old Agim Sekiraqa, a Kosovan-Albanian refugee who was granted British citizenship in 1992. He lives in his two-bedroom flat with his wife and two children; having initially been tenants of Westminster city council, they bought it under the Right to Buy in 2002. \"I thought my kids would have a roof above their heads when we are not around any more,\" he says. \"That was my main reason. And at the time, we thought, 'Well, now we have our own place, no one can kick us out.' We felt secure.\" With a discount of 33%, and having secured a loan, they paid \u00a341,500. </p> <p>In 2005, however, there came grim news. In return for work on his block's exterior - focused on windows, balconies and cladding - Citywest, Westminister council's property management company, would soon be expecting a payment of at least \u00a358,000. In a small handful of London boroughs - notably Southwark and Westminster - this seems be common practice, and for the Sekiraqa family, it seemed to spell doom. \"It was a disaster,\" he says, and you can see his point: he does bits of work as a freelance interpreter and works part-time for his local MP, and his wife does likewise for Tesco. \"Once the work is done, we have three years to pay,\" he says, \"but over three years, we will earn much less than that. We're a low-income family.\" </p> <p>A cloud of anxiety has been hanging around the Sekiraqas for three years; the work on their block looks set to be finished at the end of 2009, whereupon the service charge will be payable. Their only hope is an eventual council tribunal, and a stipulation in their contract that in the first five years of leaseholding, the council guaranteed that there would be no increase in service charges. Everything hangs on whether this new demand is dated to when notice was served, or the first payment is due - and if they lose, things look bleak. \"We have two years to finish the loan we have now,\" he says. \"Applying for another one, on a low income, in the credit crunch ... that's not a solution at all. I don't see a way out of this situation. It makes my life miserable: I try to keep it inside and hide it from my children, because I don't want them to see that level of stress.\"</p> <p>If he put the flat on the open market, he tells me, anyone wanting to buy it would have trouble getting a mortgage, which leaves only one option, set out in a letter he recently received from Citywest. \"You may have read recently about the government's plans for affordable housing, and to reduce the number of people on the housing waiting list currently in temporary accommodation,\" it says. \"We are intending to deliver suitable accommodation targets by buying suitable homes from existing leaseholders and specifically targeting two- and three-bedroom properties.\" </p> <p>It goes on to promise \"an excellent opportunity to get a competitive price without some of the expense and hassle of using an estate agent\". </p> <p>As Sekiraqa sees it, the most he would be likely to get for the flat would be around \u00a3120,000, which \"would hardly get a studio flat in zone 4\". Worse still, though the council emphatically denies it, he cannot help but suspect that punitive service charges are an easy way of emptying some of the properties they suddenly claim to need. </p> <p>His advice for any Westminster tenant thinking of taking up the Right to Buy is simple enough. \"Don't do it. The risk is not worth it.\"</p> <p>So which way out of this mess? Looking for political answers is not easy, not least because so much of Right to Buy's legacy is way off the parliamentary radar, and mainstream politicians - in deference to the \"aspiration\" Right to Buy was once held to embody - are usually far keener to talk about new affordable homes to buy rather than helping those who either need or want to rent, or those hapless Right to Buyers who have been waylaid by some of its most malign aspects. </p> <p>In fairness to the government, it has a track record of ratcheting down Right to Buy, reducing the available discounts in many areas, and upping the minimum time before homes can be sold on. But the issue sits uneasily on the fault-line that separates old and New Labour, and the political damage caused by the opposition voiced in the early 80s still sits in the party's psyche. Thus questioning the policy itself and decisively getting to grips with some of its most damaging aftershocks still elude them. </p> <p>The Tories, by contrast, seem to be sticking by their old evangelism, promising to extend Right to Buy to the one million tenants of housing associations who are currently prohibited from taking out a mortgage on their homes. Conservative rhetoric is slightly cuddlier than it was 30 years ago: their housing spokesman, Grant Shapps, talks in vague terms about \"introducing measures to get the replenishment of our housing stock moving once again\", but such talk hardly impresses those housing insiders who think, with good reason, that putting jump-leads on Right to Buy would only deepen Britain's massive housing problems. </p> <p>All that said, such differences tend to get lost in a fog of cross-party tributes to public-private partnerships and the glories of home ownership, and the two main parties' support for transferring existing council homes to housing associations. Of late, only one big political party has sharply departed from the post-Thatcher consensus: the Scottish National party, which has announced plans to abolish the Right to Buy on new council houses and thereby encourage local authorities to get back to building them (between 2003 and 2007, a total of six Scottish council houses were built, and they were all in the Shetland Isles). </p> <p>The proposals will be put before the Scottish parliament late next year, though several Scottish councils have already resolved to build new houses in expectation of the change. When I speak to the SNP's deputy first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, I mention Right to Buy's supposed embodiment of aspiration, but it doesn't cut much ice. \"Well, first things first,\" she says. \"I grew up in a house that was bought under the Right to Buy, so I get the aspiration argument. I think enabling people to own their own homes is a thoroughly good thing to do. But you have to look at these things in the round. We support, thoroughly, the idea of people aspiring to home ownership. But there should also be a right to rent for people who can't afford to buy or who don't want to buy. We have to make sure we have a balance in our policy, and there's enough emphasis on the availability of social rented housing, too.\"</p> <p>Back in Barking and Dagenham, my day ends with one last conversation with another Right to Buy veteran: 73-year-old Ron Goodchild, who bought his and his wife's three-bedroom house for \u00a38,900 in 1982 and now reckons it's worth around \u00a3180,000. They have lived here for 46 years, but soon enough, they will be on their way, like the neighbours who have escaped to various places on the southern English coast. One of his daughters, he tells me, has bought a house in Limoges in central France, and the plan is for Ron and his wife to join them. Dagenham, he tells me, has been \"depreciated\" by a lot of what he calls \"aggravation and stupidity\"; he isn't keen on the idea that Right to Buy had much to do with it, but like so many of the people I have met here, he talks about a mislaid sense of community and neighbourliness.</p> <p>Liam Smith gives me a lift back to Dagenham Heathway tube station, and tells me about two recent developments. First, the borough council is about to become one of the first local authorities to found a new breed of Local Housing Companies, set up in partnership with the private sector and aimed at providing homes for sale, shared ownership and rent - which some critics malign as further proof of New Labour's mistrust of traditional council housing, but Smith sees as \"the biggest step back towards it that we've had under this government\". Second, they have plans to start buying back the kind of ex-council properties that have long since been sold on and fallen into disrepair, and thereby bring Right to Buy full circle.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, he explains this last change with a barrel-chested pride. \"It's fantastic, isn't it?\" he says. \"We want to return them to a decent standard. I want settled, stable communities. I want neighbours to know each other - whether it be the dentist from Lithuania, the retired midwife from Dagenham, or the man from Nigeria. That's what council housing can do. It's just that too many people have forgotten it\".</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 The rise and fall of council houses</strong> A gallery and timeline of social housing <a href=\"http://SocietyGuardian.co.uk/housing\">SocietyGuardian.co.uk/housing</a></p>",
  "<p>Fears that the global economic downturn is curtailing consumer shopping habits sent Apple's shares plunging 16% as analysts took a red pen to previously robust forecasts for sales of iPods, iMacs and iPhones.</p> <p>At one point, the drop was the biggest one-day fall for Apple in seven years. It was a marked change of sentiment towards one of Silicon Valley's most profitable companies, which had previously been seen as relatively immune to recession.</p> <p>Kathryn Huberty, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, triggered the rout with a research note slashing her price target for Apple's shares from $178 to $115. \"We worry that consensus estimates have not been revised down to reflect slowing global consumer demand,\" she wrote.</p> <p>By lunchtime on the New York Stock Exchange, Apple had fallen by $17.19 to $110.26. This triggered a wholesale sell-off in tech stocks, which were already wobbling after disappointing figures last week from the BlackBerry smartphone maker Research in Motion. The technology-dominated Nasdaq index slumped by 4.7% to 2,080.</p> <p>An RBC Capital analyst, Mike Abramsky, cut his Apple price target from $200 to $140, pointing to market research suggesting a sharp fall in the number of people who plan to buy new computers over the next 90 days.</p> <p>Last year's launch of the iPhone brought long queues to Apple stores around the world and since then the company's carefully managed global roll-out of the handsets has generated much excitement.</p> <p>But in the US, economic gloom appears to be setting in.

  "<p>With the global financial system in meltdown, George Osborne faced two big problems in his speech yesterday. The first was to be heard at all on a day when Bradford &amp; Bingley was nationalised, shares were plunging and the markets were fretting about which would be the next domino to fall.</p> <p>The second was to finger Gordon Brown as the man responsible for Britain's economic woes, a more difficult task than it was a couple of weeks ago. Conservative strategists are aware of the public antagonism towards the City, and are keen to counter the idea that Labour will be more comfortable re-regulating the banks than the party traditionally associated with making life easier for big finance. Osborne's answer to the first problem was an eye-catching proposal to cut council tax by taking the axe to central government's burgeoning budget for consultancy and advertising. Any council that keeps its council tax increases to 2.5% of less will receive extra money from Whitehall to reduce bills by a further 2.5%.</p> <p>This, no question, is the sort of thing that goes down well in Middle England (the deal does not apply to the devolved administrations in the rest of the UK). It is hard for ministers to justify the colossal sums spent on management consultancy; the government spends five times as much per employee as the private sector.</p> <p>Moreover, voters hate paying council tax, which they assume is being blown by town-hall penpushers rather than being spent on frontline services. The move towards fortnightly refuse collection has merely served to heighten this suspicion. Osborne assumes that councils will be able to keep their council tax increases to 2.5% through greater efficiency. This may be more difficult than he thinks. The bulk of council spending goes on wages and salaries, which are rising by around 4%. Add on the costs of public sector pensions and care for an ageing population and it's not hard to see why there is upward pressure on council tax bills.</p> <p>Osborne's answer to the second problem was to treat 1997 as year zero, ignoring the preceding 18 years of Conservative rule. So, no mention of financial deregulation, big bang, or the huge boom-bust in the housing market of the late 1980s and 1990s. But his attack on Labour's handling of the economy was effective. He pointed out - correctly - that for the past decade or more growth has depended on the three engines of finance, housing and government spending, and scant attention was paid to what would happen if those engines stalled.</p> <p>If Labour's recovery in the opinion polls proves short-lived, it will be because the public has reached the same conclusion, and Osborne was scathing about the prime minister's boast that Labour had abolished boom and bust.</p> <p>The opposition's fear, nonetheless, is that the government will benefit from the financial crisis, because of the effective action taken to rescue banks in trouble over the past fortnight, and from an unspoken sense that the Conservatives remain the party of the hedge fund dealer and the short-seller. </p> <p>As a result, Osborne deployed some of his toughest language when he said he would not \"increase taxes on the family earning \u00a320,000 to carry on paying the bonuses of the banker earning \u00a32m.\" It was far more robust than Brown, Alistair Darling or any other member of the cabinet managed in Manchester last week. </p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama is opening a clear lead over John McCain after polls at the weekend showed the public overwhelmingly awarding Friday night's presidential debate to the Democratic candidate.</p> <p>The polls suggest McCain did not benefit from suspending his campaign and flying to Washington last week to help deal with the financial crisis.</p> <p>The gap could see an increase in more personal - and ugly - attacks on Obama. An early sign of that came yesterday in a row over a dead soldier's bracelet. Obama was accused of wearing the bracelet against the wishes of the soldier's mother.</p> <p>With five weeks until the presidential election, Obama appears to have broken the impasse that had seen the two in a dead heat in polls over the past month.</p> <p>A USA Today poll, published yesterday, showed 45% of those questioned felt Obama had done better in the debate than McCain, who registered 34%. The public view is at odds with the media, which overwhelmingly judged it to be a draw.</p> <p>Other polls, including the Rasmussen tracking poll, showed voters drifting towards Obama. The Rasmussen poll put Obama on 50% and McCain on 44%, which would give the Democratic candidate a landslide victory.</p> <p>McCain returned to the campaign trail yesterday alongside his vice-presidential running mate, Sarah Palin, for the first time since suspending his campaign last Wednesday.</p> <p>In a speech in Ohio, McCain stuck to his main message of whether Obama was fit to be president, saying the Democratic candidate had always voted with the party and had shown no sign of putting his country first. He also accused him of lying about tax plans in Friday's debate.</p> <p>As the election nears, the two campaigns are firing back more claims and denials, and at increasing speed. Obama's team's denial on tax was out before McCain had completed his speech.</p> <p>If Obama maintains his lead, the Republicans are almost certain to step up personal attacks on him. In a column for the New York Times yesterday, the rightwing commentator William Kristol, editor of the Weekly Standard, offered suggestions on how McCain could win that included raising again Obama's links with figures such as the Reverend Jeremiah Wright, the controversial cleric.</p> <p>An early sign that the campaign could turn more personal was yesterday's row over Obama's possession of the bracelet of a US soldier killed in Iraq. Stories quickly appeared on the internet suggesting the mother objected to Obama exploiting her son's death. </p> <p>During the debate, McCain said a soldier's mother had given him a bracelet. \"I've got a bracelet too, from Sergeant ... from the mother of Sergeant Ryan David Jopek, given to me in Green Bay,\" said Obama.</p> <p>The mother, Tracy Jopek, told AP yesterday she was \"ecstatic\" that Obama had mentioned her son. \"I don't understand how people can take that and turn it into some garbage on the internet,\" she said.</p> <p>She had asked Obama in February not to mention her son, but she felt it was appropriate on Friday in response to McCain.</p> <p>Obama and McCain have established what they refer to as truth squads, each offering quick rebuttals to what they see as incorrect claims.</p>",
  "<p>People will have to be rationed to four modest portions of meat and one litre of milk a week if the world is to avoid run-away climate change, a major new report warns.</p> <p>The report, by the Food Climate Research Network, based at the University of Surrey, also says total food consumption should be reduced, especially \"low nutritional value\" treats such as alcohol, sweets and chocolates.</p> <p>It urges people to return to habits their mothers or grandmothers would have been familiar with: buying locally in-season products, cooking in bulk and in pots with lids or pressure cookers, avoiding waste and walking to the shops - alongside more modern tips such as using the microwave and internet shopping.</p> <p>The report goes much further than any previous advice after mounting concern about the impact of the livestock industry on greenhouse gases and rising food prices. It follows a four-year study of the impact of food on climate change and is thought to be the most thorough study of its kind.</p> <p>Tara Garnett, the report's author, warned that campaigns encouraging people to change their habits voluntarily were doomed to fail and urged the government to use caps on greenhouse gas emissions and carbon pricing to ensure changes were made. \"Food is important to us in a great many cultural and symbolic ways, and our food choices are affected by cost, time, habit and other influences,\" the report says. \"Study upon study has shown that awareness-raising campaigns alone are unlikely to work, particularly when it comes to more difficult changes.\"</p> <p>The report's findings are in line with an investigation by the October edition of the Ecologist magazine, which found that arguments for people to go vegetarian or vegan to stop climate change and reduce pressure on rising food prices were exaggerated and would damage the developing world in particular, where many people depend on animals for essential food, other products such as leather and wool, and for manure and help in tilling fields to grow other crops. </p> <p>Instead, it recommended cutting meat consumption by at least half and making sure animals were fed as much as possible on grass and food waste which could not be eaten by humans. </p> <p>\"The notion that cows and sheep are four-legged weapons of mass destruction has become something of a distraction from the real issues in both climate change and food production,\" said Pat Thomas, the Ecologist's editor.</p> <p>The head of the United Nations intergovernmental panel on climate change, Rajendra Pachauri, also sparked global debate this month when he urged people to have at least one meat-free day a week.</p> <p>The Food Climate Research Network found that measured by production, the UK food sector produces greenhouse gases equivalent to 33m tonnes of carbon. Measured by consumption - including imports - the total rises to 43.3m tonnes. Both figures work out at under one fifth of UK emissions, but they exclude the indirect impacts of actions such as clearing rainforest for cattle and crops, which other studies estimate would add up to 5% to 20% of global emissions.</p> <p>The report found the meat and dairy sectors together accounted for just over half of those emissions; potatoes, fruit and vegetables for 15%; drinks and other products with sugar for another 15%; and bread, pastry and flour for 13%.</p> <p>It also revealed which parts of the food chain were the most polluting. Although packaging has had a lot of media and political attention, it only ranked fifth in importance behind agriculture - especially the methane produced by livestock burping - manufacturing, transport, and cooking and refrigeration at home. </p> <p>The report calls for meat and dairy consumption to be cut in developed countries so that global production remains stable as the population grows to an estimated 9bn by 2050. </p> <p>At the same time emissions from farms, transport, manufacturing and retail could be cut, with improvements including more efficient use of fertilisers, feed and energy, changed diets for livestock, and more renewable fuels - leading to a total reduction in emissions from the sector of 50% to 67%, it says. </p> <p>The UN and other bodies recommend that developed countries should reduce total emissions by 80% by 2050.</p> <p>However, the National Farmers' Union warned that its own study, with other industry players, published last year, found net emissions from agriculture could only be cut by up to 50% if the carbon savings from building renewable energy sources on farms were taken into account. </p> <p>The NFU also called for government incentives to help farmers make the changes. \"Farmers aren't going to do this out of the goodness of their hearts, because farmers don't have that luxury; many of our members are very hard pressed at the moment,\" said Jonathan Scurlock, the NFU's chief adviser on renewable energy and climate change.</p> <h2>Different diets</h2> <p><strong>The way we eat now (average person in the UK, per week)</strong></p> <p><strong>1.6kg meat and 4.2 litres of milk, which is equivalent to:</strong></p> <p>6 sausages (450g)</p> <p>2 chicken breasts (350g)</p> <p>4 ham sandwiches (100g)</p> <p>8 slices of bacon (250g)</p> <p>3 burgers (450g)</p> <p>3 litres of milk</p> <p>100g of cheese and a helping of cream</p> <p><strong>Future recommended diet (average person, per week)</strong></p> <p><strong>500g of meat and 1 litre of milk, which is equivalent to:</strong></p> <p>1 quarter-pound beefburger</p> <p>2 sausages</p> <p>3 rashers of bacon</p> <p>1 chicken breast </p> <p>1 litre of milk or 100g of cheese</p>",
  "<h2>Perverse bursaries</h2> <p>The headline to the article by David Willetts on widening participation (University expansion requires realistic funding, 23 September) is dead right. But Willetts completely ignores the most critical area for immediate attention. The premium on funding provided to institutions to support students from disadvantaged backgrounds is, by all research accounts, grossly inadequate to meet the needs. If there is a real desire to widen participation effectively, far greater support - funding and recognition - must be directed to those institutions that are fully committed to providing quality opportunities to such students, and have genuine track records of success. And for heaven's sake don't make things worse by further deregulation of fees and perpetuating the perverse inequities of the current arrangements for bursaries. <br><strong>Dr Michael Goldstein CBE</strong> Streetly, West Midlands </p> <h2>Faith in academies</h2> <p>In his article on the ballot for a new academy in Sheffield (The world and Lord Adonis are watching Sheffield, September 16), Francis Beckett states that the British Edutrust Foundation (Edutrust) is \"controlled by wealthy business people, many of them Muslims\". He then states that \"Its first thought seems to have been to take over a mostly Muslim school.\" Finally, he infers that, having been unsuccessful in securing an overwhelming Muslim school in either Bradford or Sheffield, Edutrust has had to settle for bidding for Parkwood school. This is nonsense. Our first academy opened this month in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire. It has few, if any, Muslim pupils. In addition to Parkwood, we are currently consulting on opening academies in September 2009 in Leeds, Birmingham, Brent and Richmond upon Thames. These are areas with very different communities and a broad range of faiths.</p> <p>Unlike the United Learning Trust (ULT), the Christian educational charity that sponsors two academies in Sheffield, Edutrust is not a faith-based organisation and is not a subsidiary of any such organisation. My trustees come from all walks of life and from different faiths. They have individually and collectively made it clear that academies sponsored by Edutrust will not be faith schools. Edutrust academies are accessible to pupils and parents of all faiths or no faith.</p> <p>Beckett has made it clear in his publications that he is no supporter of the government's academy programme.

  "<p>Lord Justice Scott Baker has had a distinguished career in the law. Coming from a legal family, he now sits as a senior judge in the High Court, with 40 years' experience behind him. Described as shrewd and unflappable, the silver-haired 71-year-old was praised for his fair handling of the inquest, earlier this year, into the death of Princess Diana. </p> <p>Outside the courts, he spent 14 years helping to run a private prep school in Buckinghamshire and for much of that time was the chairman of the board of governors. </p> <p>But now it is being alleged that he and the headmaster mishandled a case of alleged sexual abuse of a boy at the school by a teacher. </p> <p>Both men appear to have broken the school's policy by failing to report the alleged abuse to social services or to the police for the case to be investigated. </p> <p>The abuse is alleged to have happened at the Caldicott prep school near Farnham Royal, Buckinghamshire. The school, for 240 boys aged seven to 13, benefits from 40 acres of grounds and playing fields. Most boys go on to to elite schools such as Harrow and Eton. Its old boys include Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat leader.</p> <p>For obvious reasons, the boy cannot be identified and we will call him John. He is suffering psychological problems and has been receiving counselling.</p> <p>The school is also alleged to have withheld important information in an earlier court case, which will feature tonight in a television documentary. </p> <p>At the heart of the new allegation is a policy that Caldicott adopted in 2000. In a letter to Whitehall's education department, the school pledged that it would change its procedures \"to cover investigations by police and or social services in cases of suspected abuse\". </p> <p>In the letter seen by the Guardian the school promised that \"any member of staff suspected of child abuse will immediately be suspended from duty pending further investigation by the police or social services\".</p> <p>The incident involving John is alleged to have happened in the early 2000s, late one night in the boy's dormitory. The next morning, John reported the allegation to the headmaster, Simon Doggart, who immediately told Baker.</p> <p>Doggart spoke to the father of the boy and it was agreed that the boy should write a statement of what had happened. </p> <p>The head arranged for the boy to meet his tutor and the school's bursar, whom Doggart says was considered to be reasonably independent as he was not a teacher nor part of the accused teacher's circle.</p> <p>The boy wrote a statement in the head's study in the presence of these two men.</p> <p>The boy's father says that he agreed that his son should give a written report of the incident, but says that in retrospect, the way it was done was \"woefully inadequate\" as his son was not given any counselling or representation for the meeting. </p> <p>He says that the statement was taken down in a \"tense, if not hostile, environment\" and so his son gave a \"superficial or watered-down account\". </p> <p>He says it was hardly surprising that a boy would be \"reluctant to go into graphic details of the extent of the abuse in the presence of at least one person with whom he was not familiar\". He says a more detailed account was given later by the boy to his mother.</p> <p>The school says that at the time, the parents did not criticise the way the statement was taken and, as a contemporaneous note taken at the time says, were \"happy for the headmaster to sort it out\".</p> <p>As required under the school's policy, the teacher had been suspended quickly after the incident, and he did not return. However, the school did not report the allegation to the police or social services.</p> <p>The school argues that this was not done because both parents had adamantly insisted on several occasions that the allegation should not be reported to the social services or police, as they wanted to shield their son from any publicity.</p> <p>The school says it did not feel that it should have overruled the strong wishes of the parents. Caldicott adds that its contemporaneous records \"show quite clearly that the school's actions were determined by the wishes of the parents\".</p> <p>The parents say that at the early stages of the issue, they were not informed by the headmaster or Scott Baker that it was Caldicott's policy to report such allegations to social services or the police. </p> <p>They add - crucially in their minds - that the school did not tell them that their son's anonymity was assured if social services or the police were called in. </p> <p>The father says: \"Unaware of the fact that reporting to police and social services would protect my son's anonymity, I was desperate that the events should not be disclosed or reported to other parties for the simple reason of protecting my son.\"</p> <p>Donald Findlater, of the child protection charity Lucy Faithfull Foundation, said allegations should be forwarded to police or social services, two independent bodies with expertise in investigating child abuse, because schools are not equipped to conduct a criminal inquiry into such claims. </p> <p>He added that in recent years, regulations covering schools have been tightened up. At the time of the incident, schools were not automatically required to inform the police or social services. Now schools are advised by the government that any allegation should be examined objectively by someone independent of the school.</p> <p>A few days after the incident, the parents met the headmaster to discuss it. The school's notes of the meeting record that the parents said their child \"had been very frightened\" and was \"now very calm\". Another meeting was held with Scott Baker a few months later, at which the judge said there was no evidence the teacher had abused other boys.</p> <p>The school's governing body considered the incident when it met two months after it happened.</p> <p>According to the minutes, the parents had \"initially been content with the action taken by the school\" but were \"unhappy with some aspects of the incident\".</p> <p>Scott Baker told the meeting that although there was no legal obligation for the school to take any further action, \"there was, he believed, a moral obligation. The action would be to report the matter to the Department for Education and Employment [DfEE] and or to social services.\"</p> <p>\"The parents do not wish any further action to be taken and did not wish their son to be subjected to a further ordeal. In particular, they did not wish their son identified to any outside body\". </p> <p>One member of the board is recorded as saying that social services \"should definitely be consulted\". The minutes record that Scott Baker \"reminded\" the board that the boy's father was \"adamant that he did not wish his son to be further disturbed or identified as a result of this incident\".</p> <p>After a long discussion, the majority of the board \"agreed that the allegation should be reported to the DfEE or to social services\".</p> <p>Caldicott did not notify social services. It did make a full disclosure to the DfEE, which is responsible for warning other employers that a teacher has been accused or convicted of abusing children.</p> <p>Ten months after the alleged assault, the parents told the school that their son was \"now prepared to be interviewed by the appropriate authorities\". The school informed the DfEE of this development. </p> <p>However, the allegation did not reach the police until at least a year after that, reported not by the school, but by another, unknown source. The police investigated and interviewed John and, after a year, the Crown Prosecution Service concluded there was not enough evidence to start a prosecution. </p> <p>The parents believe that the delay reduced the chances of gaining a conviction - a suggestion rejected by Caldicott. The school reiterated that the delay was \"unlikely\" to have made a difference and in any case there was a \"lack of conclusive evidence\" against the teacher. </p> <p>The parents also point to a series of incidents which they believe show that the school trivalised the allegation. These claims are rejected by Caldicott. </p> <p>Questions have also been raised about the school's handling of earlier abuse allegations that have been levelled against Peter Wright, Caldicott's headmaster between 1968 and 1993.</p> <p>He has been accused of sexually abusing boys aged 11 to 14 at the school between 1964 and 1970 while he was a teacher and then headmaster. </p> <p>Wright denied the allegations and asserted that he never had any sexual interest in boys. When the case came to court in 2003, the judge stayed the prosecution as he concluded that Wright, then 73, would not get a fair trial because of the three-decade delay. The allegations had not been reported by the former pupils to the police until 2001.</p> <p>Judge Roger Connor told the court that the school had refused to provide potentially important information to Wright - one of a number of reasons for staying the prosecution. The school rejects the allegation, saying that it did offer to give Wright information - lists of former boys who could be called as witnesses - but the offer was never taken up. The judge \"appears to have been misled\", the school added. </p> <p>Tonight, in a television documentary on More4, three former Caldicott pupils movingly describe how they were groomed and then regularly abused at the school in the 1960s and 1970s. Martin Carson, a teacher who had abused one of the boys, was jailed in 2003 for child abuse offences. Two of them did not tell anyone about the abuse for more than 30 years and suffered severe depression. </p> <p>One of them, Tom Perry, is now campaigning to spread the message that every parent should scrutinise a school's child protection procedures to ensure the safety of their offspring. This, he says, is as important as other factors such as league tables and catchment areas.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> True Stories: Chosen, by True Vision Productions, will be shown tonight at 10pm on More4.

  "<p>Anglo-American finance ministers and central bankers, like little Dutch boys, try desperately to plug leaks in the bursting dyke that is the international financial system. In the US, treasury secretary Hank Paulson hoped for $700bn to plug the gaping hole in Wall Street's banks. In the UK, the government is not just plugging holes, but setting aside competition rules to encourage the monopolisation of finance. Alistair Darling suspended competition rules to allow the Lloyds Bank takeover of HBOS because of the crisis. This is like suspending the law during hurricanes. The demise of another independent bank, Bradford &amp; Bingley, and the transfer of its savings business to Santander, will increasingly monopolise finance. </p> <p>Will these plugs and private-sector fixes work? No, because a) they are not system-wide fixes and b) they are based on the same flawed economic policies that spurred this crisis in the first place. </p> <p>Some of these policies, attributable to Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman, are already discredited. Contempt for government is no longer acceptable. Using fiscal policies to bail out banks is now sanctioned by all political parties. To refuse to use fiscal policies to bail out taxpayers who lose pensions, homes and jobs, will make political parties unelectable. </p> <p>But there are other orthodox economic policies that remain intact and are as yet unchallenged by any political party. The most damaging is orthodox monetary policy. This is based on the assumption that money is a commodity, and that its \"price\" - the rate of interest - must be set by supply and demand for money in private markets for capital - just as the price of oil is set by supply and demand for oil. </p> <p>This is a nonsense. We do not dig capital out of the ground, nor does it grow on trees. Money is man-made. Interest rates are a social construct. And as such, unlike oil or soya beans, \"there are no intrinsic reasons for the scarcity of capital\", as Keynes argued in the General Theory. Because there is no reason for the scarcity of capital, there is no reason for the price of capital to be high. </p> <p>And yet the private finance sector has succeeded in creating a shortage of capital, the credit crunch, and - at the height of a debt crisis - ratchets its price ever upwards. The rate for private inter-bank loans (Libor) continues to move upwards as the crisis worsens. </p> <p>The private finance sector also requires that central banks maintain official, or base rates at current levels by adhering to a policy esoterically named \"inflation targeting\". In fact these high rates, by making debts unpayable, lead to rapid de-leveraging of debts (think bank failures) and assets (think property price falls) and are dangerously deflationary. </p> <p>Flawed monetary policies are turning a crisis into a catastrophe. They must be challenged. Keynes's cool, rational voice on monetary theory and monetary policy must once again be heeded. Central banks must once again take control over all rates - short and long, safe and risky. </p> <p>But a system-wide fix would go further. It would challenge the orthodoxy that unemployment helps keep wages low and is a good thing; and that wage rises are always inflationary. It is this orthodoxy that has caused wages and other forms of compensation to fall as a share of GDP in all OECD countries over the past three decades. This fall in compensation has forced people to supplement incomes by borrowing more. </p> <p>Creating jobs and raising incomes as a share of GDP is vital if we want people to repay debts, salvage banks and return to the high street. If we fail to adopt such system-wide fixes, and if we persist with economic orthodoxy, then look forward to a prolonged period of global economic failure.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.debtonation.org\">debtonation.org</a></p>",
  "<p>The FTSE 100 suffered one of its biggest one-day falls yesterday, taking the index to below the point it reached before the record-breaking rally of 10 days ago.</p> <p>The index tumbled 269.7 points, a 5.3% drop that was the eighth-worst on record, amid a Europe-wide sell-off of banking stocks and early falls on Wall Street. That meant it ended the day at 4818.8, lower than it was before news of the US government's planned bail-out of toxic debts eased the panic in world markets and prompted the index's record gain.</p> <p>Only one stock, supermarket group <strong>Wm Morrison</strong>, remained in positive territory on a bruising day of trading. </p> <p>Banks were the main casualties, hit by Bradford &amp; Bingley's nationalisation, the bail-out of European bank Fortis and the nationalisation of Iceland's third-largest bank, Glitnir.</p> <p>NatWest owner <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> dropped 13%, or 27p, to 181p, having gone as low as 163p. <strong>Lloyds TSB</strong> fell 13.5%, or 33.75p, to 217.25p, while <strong>HBOS</strong> slumped about 18%, or 31.3p, to 142p. <strong>Barclays</strong> fell 8.8%, or 32.25p, to 334.25p.</p> <p>Despite the banking sector's woes, the FTSE 100's biggest percentage faller was <strong>Icap</strong>, the inter-dealer broker run by Conservative party treasurer Michael Spencer. It fell almost 24% despite saying group revenue in the six months to September 30 was expected to be up by a fifth on the same period last year. </p> <p>Analysts pointed to doubts about the company's future profit growth as the shares closed 89.25p lower at 289.25p.</p> <p><strong>Man</strong>, the world's biggest listed hedge fund manager, was another big loser, falling some 18%, or 68.25p, to 305.5p.</p> <p>There were steep drops among the miners amid falling commodity prices and continuing fears for the health of the global economy. <strong>Lonmin</strong>, which announced the departure of its chief executive, Brad Mills, fell 14.6% to close down \u00a33.61 at \u00a321.08. That is well short of the \u00a333 potential offer made last month by rival <strong>Xstrata</strong>. Shares in Xstrata, which has until Thursday to clarify its intentions towards Lonmin, slumped 17.5%, or \u00a33.34, to \u00a315.78. <strong>Eurasian Natural Resources</strong> and <strong>Kazakhmys</strong> suffered 15% falls, the former down 85.75p to 473.25p, the latter 98p to 567p.</p> <p>Travel group <strong>Thomas Cook</strong> ended flat at 202.75p after its principal shareholder, German group Arcandor, said it would not be selling its 52% stake. Thomas Cook also said it was abandoning talks about a potential merger of its airline, Condor, with rival operation Germanwings.</p> <p>Advertising group <strong>WPP</strong> was one of the day's many casualties, sliding 34.5p to 439.25p.

  "<p>Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, said yesterday she would fight to win back voters in time for next year's general election, following a setback for a conservative sister party in regional elections.</p> <p>Merkel, whose chances of re-election may be in doubt after the Christian Social Union (CSU) lost its absolute majority in Bavaria for the first time in almost half a century, said German voters were not being given enough reassurance at a time of global financial turmoil.</p> <p>\"At this moment in time what's most important is to give people support in the age of globalisation,\" she said, her disappointment obvious during a brief appearance before reporters after the CSU's poor result on Sunday in Germany's most populous and prosperous state. </p> <p>The CSU saw its support drop by 17 percentage points to 43% - its worst result since 1954.</p> <p>Traditionally, Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) has benefited from its allies' strong backing in Bavaria at general elections but that support base has been greatly weakened by the CSU's losses.</p> <p>Merkel refused to take the blame for the performance and used the opportunity to call the CDU the \"stability factor\" in her grand coalition with the Social Democrats. But she needs the support of the CSU if she is to win next year's election.</p> <p>The CSU, which was credited with modernising Bavaria, will now have to seek a coalition partner. It has a number to choose from, including the pro-business Free Democrats, which made great strides to secure 8% of the vote and is the most likely candidate; the Greens, which also advanced to a 9.4% share; and the conservative protest party Freie W\u00e4hler (Free Voters), which emerged from nowhere to secure 10.2%. The fledgling political force Die Linke (The Left) failed to secure the 5% necessary to enter parliament.</p> <p>Voters' readiness to shun parties that have long dominated German politics also gave the Social Democrats, which gained no advantage from the CSU's substantial losses, their worst result since 1945 with just 18.6% of the vote. </p> <p>In the Bundesrat, or upper house, Merkel's grand coalition will now have only a wafer-thin majority with which to push through legislation.</p>",
  "<p>The contagion from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/wallstreet\">Wall Street</a> crisis spread throughout Europe yesterday with the governments of Iceland and Germany stepping in to rescue ailing banks, following the decision in Britain to nationalise <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bradfordbingley\">Bradford &amp; Bingley</a> and the bail-out of the Belgian bank Fortis late on Sunday.</p> <p>In the United States, at the eye of the financial storm, Citigroup agreed to buy Wachovia, the fourth largest American bank, in another deal brokered by officials in Washington. It joined the growing roll call of seemingly invulnerable banks that have either failed or been taken over as the credit crunch has intensified.</p> <p>The widening turmoil was also on the agenda in France. President Nicolas Sarkozy summoned the heads of the nation's leading banks and insurance groups to an emergency summit this morning aimed at preventing the crisis from gaining traction there, even as rumours began to circulate that Franco-Belgian bank Dexia might be the next to face trouble.</p> <p>Economists were wary of predicting where the crunch might bite next. \"In the near term, it will be the weak ones that will be picked off,\" said Global Insight's chief European economist, Howard Archer. \"But obviously the more the turmoil and dislocation continues, the further this could spread. We live in vicious times.\"</p> <h2>Germany</h2> <p>The German government and other banks extended a \u20ac35bn (\u00a328bn) lifeline to Hypo Real Estate, the second largest commercial property lender in the country and one of the country's largest publicly quoted companies. The agreement represented the most serious impact of the crisis. </p> <p>The finance ministry said the government would provide \u20ac26.6bn, with several unidentified banks making up the rest. The deal had been hammered out with the German central bank, the Bundesbank, and financial regulators. In a statement, they said the financing would secure the future of the firm. </p> <p>A spokesman for the finance ministry said the decision to provide the credit came after \"very, very intensive consultations over the weekend\".</p> <p>HRE had written down substantial sums related to sub-prime mortgages at the beginning of the year, but otherwise had given little sign that it was facing difficulty in raising cash. There had been speculation in the German press over the weekend that the company could collapse. </p> <h2>Belgium</h2> <p>The governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg reached agreement on an \u20ac11.2bn bail-out of Fortis on Sunday, in the hope of avoiding the scenes Britain witnessed as customers lined up to withdraw savings from Northern Rock. </p> <p>Fortis is one of the largest retail banks across the three countries. Each government took a 49% stake in the Fortis subsidiaries in its country. As a part of the agreement, they demanded Fortis sell the stake in Dutch bank ABN Amro which it bought a year ago for \u20ac24bn, a deal that marked the beginning of the bank's troubles. Filip Dierckx, who has been running Fortis for barely three days, yesterday admitted that it had overreached itself with \"decisions which were not the best\". </p> <p>Shares in Fortis continued to fall yesterday, down another 23%, despite the bail-out and underlining the fear in the markets. Like many other banks, Fortis has had to take large write-downs on the value of mortgage-backed securities.</p> <h2>Iceland</h2> <p>The government in Reykjavik seized control of Glitnir, one of Iceland's biggest banks, stoking fears that the tiny nation might be facing financial disaster.</p> <p>The Icelandic government bought a 75% stake in Glitnir for \u20ac600m. David Oddsson, governor of the Central Bank of Iceland, said he had been presented with a stark choice. \"Without this intervention Glitnir would have ceased to exist within the next few weeks. It's as simple as that.\"</p> <p>Iceland's economy expanded rapidly in recent years, making Icelanders among the richest people in Europe, but critics argue that the wealth has been built on too much debt. The country has been likened to a \"toxic hedge fund\". The Icelandic kr\u00f3na has lost 60% of its value against the dollar this year and hit new lows yesterday, making the situation only more difficult for the banks.</p> <p>After emergency discussions with the Central Bank of Iceland, an offer was made late on Sunday and the bank's board agreed to the deal yesterday morning. </p> <p>In a statement, Glitnir said its funding position had deteriorated in a matter of days. Its largest shareholder, the investment firm Stodir, also filed for bankruptcy yesterday.</p> <p>The rescue at least partly answers one question that has been hovering over Iceland; whether the banks had grown too large for the government to bail out if things went wrong. </p> <h2>United States</h2> <p>Two weeks ago Wachovia had been cast as a potential saviour of Morgan Stanley, the Wall Street investment bank, but in a sign of how quickly matters are shifting, the bank was yesterday sold to Citigroup at a knockdown price.</p> <p>In this instance, US taxpayers are not footing any immediate bills but could end up paying a share of any losses from Wachovia's ailing mortgage portfolio. Citigroup is paying $2.2bn in shares for the company and absorbing about $52bn in debt. Citigroup has not emerged unscathed. It has already taken more than $40bn in write-downs and other losses from mortgage-related investments but has the buffer of deposits from a large retail operation.</p> <p>Investors were spooked again and shares in other smaller banks in the US plummeted as they speculated on which might be the next to falter.</p>",
  "<p>Sarah Palin was set to enter the confines of John McCain's ranch in Arizona yesterday for three days of intensive preparations ahead of her showdown against Joe Biden in this week's vice-presidential television debate. Thursday night's match in St Louis, Missouri, will bring McCain's running mate her moment of greatest national exposure since the virtual unknown joined the Republican ticket for the White House.</p> <p>Though vice-presidential debates seldom influence an election, Palin's novelty raises the importance of the clash with her Democratic party counterpart. The debate offers a chance for her to redeem herself after a number of damaging press reports and disastrous TV interviews - or to self-destruct if she fails to hold her own against the far more experienced Biden.</p> <p>In a parting shot before she entered the seclusion of the ranch for the debate rehearsals, Palin told a rally in Columbus, Ohio, yesterday that she was excited about the encounter. \"I'm looking forward to meeting Joe Biden. I've been hearing about him since second grade,\" she said.</p> <p>But the bravado belies the intense pressure on Palin to deliver a credible performance, and the efforts campaign aides have made to get her up to speed. A team of senior aides has been at her side for days, hunkering down in Philadelphia at the weekend and travelling with her yesterday. </p> <p>At first glance, the debate might look like an unequal fight. Biden has been a ubiquitous figure in Washington for 36 years; Palin was virtually unknown outside her native Alaska until 33 days ago. A Wall Street Journal poll last week found that 49% of Americans thought Palin fit to be vice-president, against 64% for Biden.</p> <p>But Biden faces challenges as well in the first national debate between male and female candidates since Geraldine Ferraro ran for vice-president in 1984. He has been rehearsing against Jennifer Granholm, the governor of Michigan, to prepare for the gender dynamics.</p> <p>\"[Palin] has to show command of her material. She has to show preparedness to take on the presidency, and she has to show more intellectual gravitas than she has shown so far,\" said Alan Schroeder, a professor at North Eastern University who has written a book about 40 years of presidential debates. \"[Biden] has the problem of high expectations versus his opponent's low expectations.\"</p> <p>Though wildly popular with hardcore Republicans, Palin has become a butt of late-night comics for her insistence that Alaska's proximity to Russia gives her some insight into international affairs.</p> <p>The conservative commentator David Brooks called her candidacy \"embarrassing\" and Newsweek's Fareed Zakaria said her answers on the economy in a CBS interview last week were \"gibberish\".</p> <p>Yesterday even Mitt Romney, a former Republican candidate for the White House, admitted that the campaign had mishandled Palin by keeping her from the media and trying to make her stick to scripted answers. \"Holding Sarah Palin to just three interviews and microscopically focusing on each I think has been a mistake,\" he told MSNBC. \"They'd be a lot wiser to let Sarah Palin be Sarah Palin. Let her talk to the media, talk to people.\" </p> <p>Palin's claim to be a crusader for reform has also been shaken by further investigation into her record in Alaska. The Associated Press reported yesterday that Palin got exemption from zoning regulations to make it easier to sell her home in Wasilla. As a small town mayor, she made it a habit to accept gifts such as a facial, flowers and even fresh salmon from local merchants.</p> <p>Palin also faces questions about policy splits. Unlike McCain, she supports drilling in the Arctic wildlife refuge and only recently admitted a human role in global warming. She also opposes stem cell research, which McCain supports.</p> <p>Such differences could prove embarrassing to Biden as well. When he was running for the White House earlier this year, Biden said he did not think Obama was ready to be president.</p> <p>He has broken with the campaign on clean coal technology, and committed a number of gaffes. Earlier this month, he embarrassed Obama and himself by saying that Hillary Clinton would have made a better vice-presidential candidate.</p> <p>But perhaps his greatest challenge is to guard against being perceived as overbearing or condescending to a younger female candidate. This is especially true in the case of Palin, whose relative inexperience could make women viewers feel protective of her.</p> <p>Such factors have also come into play in debates with the most seasoned women politicians. Hillary Clinton, widely considered the Democrats' best debater, won her 2000 Senate debate when her opponent, Rick Lazio, came up to her and waved a sheaf of papers in her face. The invasion of Clinton's personal space outraged women viewers and made Lazio seem like a bully.</p> <p>George Bush Sr lost his debate against Ferraro in 1984 the moment he decided to give her a lecture about the difference between Lebanon and Iran.</p> <p>Ferraro, who had several years experience as a New York prosecutor and congresswoman on her resume, would have none of it. \"I almost resent, Vice-President Bush, your patronising attitude that you have to teach me about foreign policy,\" she shot back.</p> <p>The gaffe-prone Biden would also do well to remember that Bush dug himself even deeper into the hole the next day by bragging to a bunch of dockers that he had \"kicked a little ass\" in the debate.</p>",
  "<p>World central banks desperately tried to stave off collapse of the global banking system yesterday with large cash injections into money markets buckling amid news of another rash of bank failures.</p> <p>The pound also suffered its biggest one-day fall since mid-1993 against the dollar as dealers focused on the fact that the US government looked as if it was going to approve its $700bn (\u00a3389bn) bail-out for US banks while the UK banking system suddenly seemed shakier than before. Sterling fell 2.3% to below $1.80 at one point. The dollar fell in late trading after the US House of Representatives voted against the bail-out plan.</p> <p>Mark Deans, dealing manager at Moneycorp, said: \"Confidence in UK banking has fallen to a new low with the nationalisation of Bradford &amp; Bingley. This has prompted a major sterling sell-off and, coupled with growing confidence that the US government's Wall Street bail-out may be agreed, it has resulted in the pound's heavy fall against the dollar.\"</p> <p>Analysts said confidence in the pound was shaken because there was still little sign that the Bank of England intended cutting interest rates to shore up an increasingly fragile economy. </p> <p>Interbank lending markets across the world were plunged into further turmoil after the weekend collapse of Bradford &amp; Bingley and Belgium's Fortis, which meant other banks remained reluctant to lend to one another. The Bank of England made an injection of \u00a340bn of three-month funding. But that was later trumped by the US Federal Reserve which, in conjunction with the BoE and other central banks, increased its reciprocal dollar fund swap arrangements to $620bn (\u00a3344bn) - more than double the previous amount.</p> <p>\"They are throwing billions around, but things seem to be getting worse. They are throwing everything they can at the problem but nothing seems to be working,\" said Joe Saluzzi of Themis Trading in New Jersey. \"There's a monster amount of fear out there. This is global contagion - it's no longer just the United States.\"</p> <p>The daily fixing of London interbank offered rate (Libor) by the British Bankers' Association showed three-month sterling rates rose to 6.26% from 6.25% even further above the Bank's official rate of 5%.</p> <p>The three-month dollar Libor fixing was up at 3.88% compared to 3.76% on Friday while three-month euro funds went up to 5.22% from 5.14% at the end of last week.</p> <p>The separate Euribor fixing for euros rose to a record of 5.24%, a rise of 10 basis points, which was the biggest jump since June. The premium for borrowing euros over the expected official bank rate three months later widened to a record high of 220 basis points.</p> <p>\"The root of the banking story is in the money markets, which are still in awful shape,\" said Padhraic Garvey, a strategist at ING Bank. \"Banks are dealing with central banks for liquidity purposes but are very careful about dealing with one another in this environment, which effectively means the interbank wholesale-money market is not working.\"</p> <p>The BoE's auction of \u00a340bn of three-month money was oversubscribed by 1.3 times, such was the demand for funds. The increases in interbank rates show central bank attempts to breathe life back into money markets have failed.</p> <p>The European Central Bank said it would make additional funds available to banks through the end of the year in \"special\" auctions. </p> <p>The central banks of Japan and Australia added more than $20bn to money markets.</p> <p>The BoE said yesterday it would also offer $10bn in an overnight money market operation.</p>",
  "<p>Whatever feminists say - and he calls himself a feminist - men are doing more housework than they used to, according to Jonathan Gershuny, head of the Centre for Time Use Research at Oxford University. So when was the last time he carried out a domestic chore? \"I cleaned the cooker yesterday,\" he says. \"I actually enjoyed it because it's not a normal thing. And it happens that I have this extremely beautiful ceramic surface. And it's a distraction from this incredibly irritating stuff ...\" He gestures towards the computer, books and charts scattered around his desk. \"What's more, it's a displacement activity with immediate returns. Because I write this stuff and it's probably wrong, and no one's going to see it for 18 months, and even then they'll disagree with it, whereas I polish this beautiful bit of ceramic and OK, I don't get much from it, but at least I can see my face in it when I've polished it.\"</p> <p><strong>Far-reaching </strong></p> <p>Clearly, collecting and analysing information about how people spend the minutes of their day-to-day lives - as Gershuny has been doing for more than 30 years of his - and how they feel about the way they spend their time, is more complicated than it looks. And the implications of this painstaking and detailed work are also far-reaching, tapping not only into questions of work/life balance and male/female relations but also the economy, the environment, future lifestyles and personal fulfilment. \"It is the things that you do during the day that determine the sort of life you have,\" says Gershuny.</p> <p>Much of Gershuny's life over the next five years will be determined by his recent receipt of a \u00a31.9m grant from the Economic and Social Research Council. This will allow Gershuny, who becomes head of the sociology department at Oxford next month, and his colleagues at the Centre for Time Use Research to analyse not only the time spent on particular activities but also on how one activity follows on from another and how the activities of different family members interact. In the process, he hopes to get closer to an understanding of how the way people spend their time changes over time and between countries.</p> <p>The bases of this work, and of all his work over the past three decades, are time-use diaries. These are specially structured diaries in which people note down exactly what they have been doing, who they have been doing it with, and, in their own words, what they felt about it. Mostly, the diaries he uses have been collected by other people - generally national offices of statistics or other academics. The first diaries he used were viewer and listener availability surveys from the BBC dating back to the late 1930s. But he has also collected diary information himself, including carrying out a study in 2000 for Eurostat, the statistical body of the European Union. </p> <p>There are inevitably problems with this kind of data. Gershuny tells the story of an early time-use survey carried out in the 1950s among students in Boston. In the section of the diary labelled \"kissing and cuddling\" male respondents reported spending around half an hour a day on the activity compared to around three minutes for women. And there are other complications, which Gershuny hopes the more detailed ESRC-funded analysis will help to reduce. Take childcare, for example. A woman may report spending only one hour a day on childcare. But dig a bit further and you are likely to find that while she is washing up, watching TV or doing the vacuuming, the child is also there, so in fact the time she actually spends on childcare is closer to 10 hours.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Gershuny has managed to gather 60 reliable surveys carried out in 30 countries, dating back over 40 years. And through analysis of these he has been able to identify dramatic shifts in the ways people have been spending their time.</p> <p>One of these is that between the 1960s and late 1980s the number of hours people spent doing paid work fell steeply, although that trend is now reversing in the UK. At the same time, the amount of time spent in unpaid work rose. This is because rather than take a train, for example, driven by a driver paid for his work, we now drive ourselves. </p> <p>While, according to the diaries, people enjoy the way they spend their time slightly more than they used to, most of this appears to be because of the decline in manual paid work. \"Arguably ... such real improvement as we have experienced is this net change in enjoyment of the paid work we do,\" says Gershuny, \"rather than the fact that we are doing less of it.\"</p> <p>Then there is the housework issue. In all the countries surveyed, including the whole of Europe, the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, the diaries show that women are doing about an hour less housework than they did 40 years ago. At the same time, men have more than doubled what they once did, although since this was only about 15 minutes a day in the first place, domestic gods remain rare. </p> <p>Gershuny maintains that the division of labour remains unfair not because of the work itself, but because of its relationship to longer-term power structures within a society. \"Where your day-to-day responsibilities mean that your main asset is devoted outside the labour force, you don't have as much human capital as your competitors,\" he says. The way each gender spends their time is therefore not the main issue. \"Time is the tool,\" he says. \"Just as economics is not about money. It's about who gets it and who does what with it. Who gets the benefit from it.\"</p> <p>This link between minute detail and sweeping social issues has been a feature of Gershuny's career. Via degrees in politics at Loughborough and research methods at Strathclyde, he joined the Science Policy Research Unit at Sussex - now Science and Technology Policy Research - in the 1970s as a transport researcher, looking at the social effects of technological change, and became involved in imagining what lifestyles would be like in the year 2020. </p> <p>There followed a period at the University of Bath, which ended after he showed his wife a graphic he had compiled of male/female career paths. It showed the husband's career shooting up and the wife's shooting down. His wife, a full-time railway engineer, swiftly suggested a return to town. The work he does on share of domestic time makes him \"conscious of the need to behave properly\", he says.</p> <p>He is particularly interested how technology affects how we use our time. The data he collects, he thinks, will aid understanding of what our future wants will be and how they can be satisfied responsibly. \"Acting responsibly as a consumer takes more time,\" he says. \"But one way of having a lower environmental impact is to do less.\"</p> <p>His data also challenges assumptions such as that supermarkets save us time. Or that if it weren't for computers we would all be busy reading. Or that men are still shirking domestic duties as much as ever. \"Unless you have got the evidence and ... have been putting it together over a long period, you can't actually establish that the difference [in domestic work] is now much less,\" he says. An incontrovertible - if time-consuming - way to solve an argument over the washing-up.</p> <h2>Curriculum Vitae</h2> <p><strong>Age </strong>59</p> <p><strong>Job </strong>Director of the Centre for Time Use Research, University of Oxford </p> <p><strong>Books</strong> Changing Times: Work and Leisure in Post-industrial Societies, Oxford University Press, 2000</p> <p><strong>Likes</strong> skiing, opera, malt whisky, cigars</p> <p><strong>Dislikes</strong> bortsch</p> <p><strong>Married</strong> to a railway software engineer, two sons</p>",

Like many Brits (and not a few Americans), he's expressed gloom about the choice of <strong>Sarah Palin</strong> as <strong>John McCain's</strong> running mate - \"she makes George Bush look like Karl Marx\" - and harbours doubts about whether <strong>Barack Obama</strong> will win. Admittedly, the interview was conducted three weeks ago, before the financial crisis, but Schama said: \"I think McCain will win. The one thing everyone believed was that Obama had balls of steel. No one thought he would lie back while various forms of the Sarah Palin bull terrier snapped at his ankles or more important parts of his political anatomy ... at this stage you don't win elections by giving philosophy lectures ... he needs a little blood on his fingertips.\" Fortuitously, the history prof has the solution to hand: \"If Obama can make the election about election history in the spirit of what we've tried to do in this series - he will win.\"</p> <p>Congratulations to one of Europe's most enduring politicians, <strong>Wilfried Martens,</strong> former Christian Democrat prime minister of Belgium - about whom <strong>Margaret Thatcher</strong> was famously dismissive in her memoirs - who has finally married his longstanding mistress, <strong>Miet Smet</strong>, who also happens to have been a Belgian employment and environment minister. The liaison, formalised in a civil ceremony in Flanders at the weekend, was an open secret in the Low Countries, where it certainly did not hinder Martens' career even when his former wife, <strong>Ilse Schouteden</strong>, tried to derail his elevation to the European People's party presidency by claiming his proximity to his lover during European parliament sessions in Strasbourg would place him in moral danger.

The treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, said he would work on an alternative plan. \"This is much too important to simply let fail,\" he said.</p> <p>Although most Democrats in the House backed the plan, two-thirds of Republicans voted against it. Many attacked it as a perversion of free-market economics and a departure from Reagan-style liberalism.</p> <p>As recriminations began, Republican leaders blamed the Democratic speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, for framing the crisis as a consequence of recklessness by the Bush administration. \"The speaker had to give a partisan voice that poisoned our conference,\" said Republican leader John Boehner. This drew ridicule from Democrats. Barney Frank, chairman of the House financial services committee, said: \"Somebody hurt my feelings so I'll punish the country? That's hardly plausible.\"</p> <p>The negative vote is a blow to the Republican presidential candidate, John McCain, who briefly suspended his campaign last week to try to broker an agreement. He urged fresh efforts to find a deal, saying: \"Now is not time to fix the blame - it's time to fix the problem.\"</p> <p>On Wall Street, there were groans as traders gathered around TV monitors to watch the vote. \"Everybody stood their with their mouths open,\" said Sal Catrini, an executive director at JP Morgan in New York, who predicted that the uncertainty would send stocks plunging. \"We're seeing real selling, but no buyers.\"</p> <p>Fourteen commercial banks have gone bust so far this year, and yesterday another troubled high-street name, Wachovia, was rescued in a takeover by Citigroup. In a Gallup poll for USA Today, 33% of Americans said they believed the country was in a depression.</p> <p>The Mortgage Bankers' Association reacted by warning of job losses as banks curtail credit to small businesses. Larry Fink, chairman of a leading US investment management firm, BlackRock, said critics had been wrong to characterise the plan as a bail-out of Wall Street. \"This is a bail-out of Main Street,\" he said. \"Banks have no ability to lend at the moment because their balance sheets are so gummed up.\"</p> <p>The financial fallout was swift and brutal. Shares in leading US banks slumped: Bank of America by 16%, Citigroup by 12% and Goldman Sachs by 11%. Oil plunged by $10 a barrel to just over $96 as traders bet on a slump reducing the need for fuel. The dollar fell sharply and the price of gold surged close to record territory.</p> <p>Peter Morici, professor of business at the University of Maryland, said: \"Things are going to get so bad something will have to be done in the next few weeks. Banks will sink, credit markets will seize, the economy will go into something much worse than a recession.\"</p>",
  "<p>George Osborne, the shadow chancellor, tried to put himself unambiguously on the side of ordinary families yesterday by promising a two-year freeze on council tax in England and warning City bankers they would have to pay for the mess they have made in the \"capitalist casino\". </p> <p>He also warned his party the era of excessive personal and state borrowing was over and as a fiscal conservative, his first priority would be to reduce borrowing, rather than provide upfront tax cuts.</p> <p>After days during which the party has appeared to lose the political initiative over the markets crisis, Osborne took a tougher rhetorical line with the City than Labour, saying he would not raise taxes on the family earning \u00a320,000 to carry on paying the bonuses of the banker earning \u00a32m. </p> <p>He told bankers: \"If you took risks, then you must bear the cost. If you pay yourself the sums far beyond what anyone else does in any other walk of life, then be prepared to lose it when you make mistakes.</p> <p>\"If you pay out big dividends when you should be rebuilding balance sheets, then you will be held to account.\" Osborne's attack, the strongest so far from a senior Conservative since the crisis broke, underlined Tory fears that their close links to the City, and faith in deregulated free markets, may lead them to lose political ground during the crisis.</p> <p>A ComRes poll for the Independent, published today, showed the Tories down three points on 41%, Labour up four on 29%, and the Liberal Democrats up one on 18%, the third poll since the Labour conference to show a squeeze on the Conservative lead.</p> <p>The poll also showed Gordon Brown was perceived as better in a crisis than David Cameron by 43% to 33%.</p> <p>Osborne nevertheless went on the attack against Brown, saying there had been terrible failure of regulation: \"Gordon, you won't get away with nailing us for casino capitalism when you're the man who has been running the casino and collecting the chips for the last 11 years.\"</p> <p>He said his party would act, and he challenged leftwing sceptics to recognise that the Conservative party, unlike New Labour, was not bedazzled by big money. </p> <p>But Osborne set out no specific proposal to make sure that City directors were held responsible for their failings although he has said he intends to strengthen the Financial Services Authority to take a tougher line on the structure of city bonuses.</p> <p>Yvette Cooper, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \"Osborne had his chance to say what the Tories would do about Bradford &amp; Bingley and the huge problems facing the global financial system. He blew it. We heard nothing about how they would deal with the greatest financial shock to hit the world for decades.\"</p> <p>Osborne offered few specific solutions to the crisis, but painted a picture of an economy teetering on the brink of recession. He claimed the Brown boom had ended in bust, with the result that the cupboard was bare and tax revenues had collapsed. </p> <p>But he said he could still help taxpayers by offering to let local authorities freeze council tax for two years. That followed a promise by Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, to freeze the Greater London Authority's precept for a year. Osborne said he was offering councils a deal whereby any council that could keep its annual council tax increase to 2.5% or below, would receive an additional 2.5% grant, funded by \u00a31bn savings from within Whitehall. </p> <p>Since the Treasury assumes councils need to increase council tax by 5%, the Tories are expecting local councils to make their own savings of 2.5%.</p> <p>The savings in central government would come from slashing the budget for consultancies by \u00a3270m in the first year and \u00a3770m thereafter. Osborne's aids said the Department for International Development and frontline services would not be affected and pointed to a highly critical recent National Audit Office report to support their claim that government mis-spent on consultancies.</p> <p>In addition the government's advertising budget would be cut from the current \u00a3391m annually to \u00a3163m.</p> <p>A council tax freeze would save the average band D household \u00a370 in the first year and \u00a3140 in the second year. Due to council tax benefit those on middle incomes would benefit most, the Institute of Fiscal Studies said. The IFS said police authorities would have the greatest difficulty meeting the 2.5% cut.</p> <p>Sir Jeremy Beecham, leader of the Labour group on the Local Government Association, said: \"No one is fooled by Osborne's scheme - he doesn't know how he'll fund these cuts, and clearly has no interest in where the cuts will hit home. I can tell him it will hit the most vulnerable, and it won't reduce any family's bills. The Tories' short-lived claims to be a party of social justice have fallen at the first hurdle.\"</p>",
  "<p>In the master suite of a four-storey, Cayman Islands-registered superyacht, a wealthy American in a monogrammed denim shirt ran his hand along the walnut columns framing the kingsize bed. He examined a vast plasma screen at the end of the bed and a second pop-up plasma screen across the room, available at the press of a button in case the panoramic sea view gets boring. </p> <p>\"I'd rather the bed was facing the sea, like on my yacht,\" he said, as his wife inspected the baroque marble bathroom with platinum sinks. She was impressed by the hot tub, treadmill and jetskis on the top deck. At nearly 50 metres and costing about \u20ac33m (\u00a326m), this superyacht would once have been considered extraordinarily lavish. Now it is seen as modest, as the boom in billionaires' floating palaces continues, regardless of the credit crunch. </p> <p>While others panic about the financial crisis, this weekend's Monaco Yacht Show proved that the mega-rich have never been richer. Yacht brokers describe an eastern European new rich, boosted by oil wealth, keen to outdo their rivals. Middle Eastern viewers and occasional Latin Americans are following suit. </p> <p>As the number of multi-billionaires grows, the superyacht industry is enjoying such a boom that demand for the most expensive models outstrips supply. Boats built to personal specifications have grown to such vast proportions that the labels superyacht and megayacht are no longer enough. Those on the dockside now talk of the gigayacht - multi-storey, 120-metre floating mansions that resemble cruise liners. The cost of the biggest new boats exceeds \u20ac200m. </p> <p>The Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich's latest 160-metre, nine-storey addition to his fleet (with two helicopters, 20 jetskis, a submarine and various other small boats on board) is a reference point. Some specialist shipyards are booked up for years ahead. There are about 2,000 superyachts - longer than 36 metres - in the world, with more than 900 being built. The Monaco Yacht Show's organisers estimate that 200,000 people are able to afford a superyacht, with prices starting in the tens of millions of euros. </p> <p>The industry has enjoyed an annual two-figure growth rate for several years. One Dutch fitter said buyers regularly spent millions on interior design, updating every few years with materials such as ebony, silver and mother of pearl. Demand for lifts and sections made of glass has also risen. Robert Matthews, of London-based Arundell Carpets, which once provided almost \u00a31m worth of handwoven silk carpets for a yacht, said business \"has never been so busy\". </p> <p>Crowds at the show gathered to inspect items including leather-interior submarines, and jetpods that pull you through the water like a dolphin. \"At this level, it's booming,\" said Marianne Richards, of Hill Robinson, which manages superyachts in Antibes. \"There might be a tiny bit of 'Oops, my shares have just dropped, I shouldn't...' but people get over it quickly. They might feel a bit guilty and say, 'I can't buy that today, I'll see what the stockmarket does' - but they'll call the next day.\"</p> <p>A steward said that although owners spent on average only four to five weeks a year on their superyachts, there was little concern for fuel costs or food bills. \"My boss had a favourite canned iced-tea drink. I couldn't get it where we were in the southern Mediterranean, so I got my agent to fly a supply of it across Europe to the yacht. The boss was just happy to have his drink; he didn't ask how I got it, or what it cost.\"</p> <p>One superyacht crew was ordered to be on standby in Italy for three months in the summer, but the owner never got a chance to visit. Eventually they were ordered to the Caribbean, and then turned around for Asia before the owner found the time to come on board.</p> <p>Jerome Dufour, a French designer of yachts, described the new massive superyachts as \"modern cathedrals\". Eastern European clients, keen to guard their privacy and aware of risks from pirates, were specifying more closed-in boats that resembled floating fortresses, with shielded decks. </p> <p>\"Once the sea would have been their swimming pool,\" said Dufour. \"Now they want swimming pools built indoors - something technically difficult. They want at least one helicopter on the top deck, and a personal submarine. </p> <p>\"It's as if they want to take possession of the entire environment around them - the sky, the water, and depths of the sea,\" he said.</p> <p>Some US shipyards specialising in the bigger superyachts have seen a boom in business from European clients because of the weak dollar. \"We're not panicking at all,\" said Paul Derecktor, president of Derecktor Shipyards. \"I am sure there will be some fallout at some level from the financial crisis. Hopefully not at the level we are talking about.\"</p> <p>But at the lower end of the market, millionaires with smaller yachts of up to 30 metres are feeling the pinch. Superyacht Business magazine has reported a decline in yachts between 15 and 35 metres pulling in to Saint-Tropez this summer, and small-scale chartering has dropped. One European fitter said many of those owners with yachts under 30 metres wanted to offload them, but were unable to find buyers.</p> <p>Ed Baker, New York-based publisher of Yachting magazine, said Americans who had spent up to $1m (\u00a3550,000) on a leisure craft in places such as Florida or the Great Lakes had been hit by the sub-prime crisis and found that they could not sell their boats. On the other hand, those who spent over $1.5m were not suffering as much from the economic climate. \"People with money are having difficulty,\" he said. \"People with wealth aren't.\"</p>",
  "<p>The US woke up to the demise of yet another high-street banking name yesterday when Wachovia agreed to a rescue takeover by the world's biggest bank, Citigroup.</p> <p>Citigroup is buying the bulk of the troubled finance group's assets for a bargain-basement price of $2.16bn (\u00a31.2bn) in stock, in a deal brokered by financial regulators to avert the possibility of another high-profile failure after Washington Mutual's collapse last week.</p> <p>In an unusual step, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has agreed to stand behind Wachovia's $312bn of risky mortgages and underperforming assets to limit Citigroup's losses to a maximum of $42bn.</p> <p>\"This action was necessary to maintain confidence in the banking industry,\" said the FDIC's chairwoman, Sheila Bair. </p> <p>Wachovia is a familiar brand across the US with 3,300 branches in 21 states. Named after an area of North Carolina that took its name from Austria's Wachau valley, it employs 120,000 people and, as of June, held $447bn of customers' deposits.</p> <p>Citigroup, which is raising $10bn through a placing of shares to help finance the deal, said the takeover advanced its aim of becoming a \"global universal bank\".</p> <p>\"We at Citigroup had the chance to look at a number of deals. This one is compelling,\" said Citigroup's chief executive, Vikram Pandit. \"We have contained the risk in the transaction. Not only is it a high-opportunity deal but also a low-risk transaction.\"</p> <p>The deal will give Citigroup the broadest branch network of any US bank, with a 9.8% market share and total deposits worldwide of $1.3tn.</p> <p>Like Washington Mutual, Wachovia ran into trouble because of its bulging portfolio of mortgages known as \"option ARMs\". These allow customers great flexibility in setting the level of their repayments - some are permitted to make payments that do not even meet accruing interest.</p> <p>\"They allowed marginal buyers to buy homes they really couldn't afford,\" said Donn Vickrey, co-founder of Gradient Analytics. \"Everything was fine as long as house prices went up and they could continue to refinance.\"</p> <p>A slump in the US property market has made it impossible for many customers to switch to more sustainable mortgages, leaving Wachovia facing huge losses.</p> <p>Wachovia's chief executive, Robert Steel, who was appointed in July on a $1m salary after the bank had run into difficulties, insisted the group's core businesses continued to do well, but said: \"Amid uncertain markets and a fast-changing industry landscape, we found Citi a strong partner to preserve the stability and quality of our banking franchise.\"</p> <p>Since the beginning of the year, 14 commercial banks have collapsed in the US, compared with only three failures over the previous three years. The FDIC last month said it had a \"watch list\" of 117 further institutions facing potential problems, holding $78bn of assets. </p> <p>In return for providing a guarantee against Wachovia's losses, the FDIC will receive preferred stock and warrants of $12bn in Citigroup.</p> <p>Wachovia's share price dived from $10 to 96 cents in early trading yesterday. At the beginning of the year, the stock was changing hands for $38. </p> <p>The US treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, backed the deal: \"I agree with the FDIC and the Federal Reserve that a failure of Wachovia would have posed a systemic risk. </p> <p>\"As a result of this transaction, all Wachovia depositors will be protected and Wachovia's senior and subordinated debt will be assumed by Citigroup.\"</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's <strong>quarterly</strong> <strong>watch list</strong> of potentially troubled US banks lengthened last month from 90 to 117. The FDIC, which guarantees customers' money held in US banks, said the list was the longest since mid-2003 and is asking its members to increase contributions to a dwindling bail-out fund.</p> <p>\"These are challenging times,\" said the FDIC's chairwoman, <strong>Sheila Bair</strong>. \"More banks will come on the list as credit problems worsen.\"</p> <p>The FDIC does not disclose the identity of institutions on the list but it said the aggregate of assets held by them had risen from $26bn to $78bn.</p> <p>Profits at US banks <strong>fell 87%</strong> to $5bn in the second quarter.</p>",
  "<p>A shock vote by the US House of Representatives to throw out Henry Paulson's $700bn mortgage bail-out prompted a bitter political postmortem and raised speculation of a cut in interest rates to shore up confidence in the system.</p> <p>As Republicans and Democrats began to assign blame, business groups reacted with anger and frustration.</p> <p>The US Chamber of Commerce said the vote had caused \"uncertainty and turmoil\" in the markets, destroying billions of dollars of household wealth. \"Make no mistake - when the aftermath of congressional inaction becomes clear, Americans will not tolerate those who stood by and let the calamity happen,\" it said.</p> <p>Economists said central banks would have to act if global markets continued to slide today. Nick Parsons, head of markets strategy at NAB Capital in London, said rejection of the bill meant that central bankers would fall back on more traditional means of oiling the markets. \"The apparent failure of this package significantly enhances the chances of bringing forward interest rate cuts\", he said.</p> <p>Outside the New York stock exchange yesterday, leftwing protesters from Jesse Jackson's Rainbow-Push coalition greeted the failure of the bail-out with enthusiasm, waving banners declaring \"no money for Wall Street\".</p> <p>But analysts said ordinary people would feel the impact. \"You couldn't make this stuff up if you tried,\" said Paul Ashworth, senior US economist at Capital Economics.</p> <p>\"They [Congress] forgot the first rule of policy making in a crisis: above all, do no harm.\"</p> <p>In dramatic trading after the Republicans rejected the bail-out investors raced to safe haven assets. Gold jumped 3% to more than $915 an ounce while 30-year treasury bonds rose sharply, as did European government debt as investors failed to be reassured by a move earlier in the day by the world's central banks to pour billions of pounds into the markets. </p> <p>The bail-out - the greatest intervention in the financial markets since the Great Depression - was regarded as a way to draw a line under the financial crisis and mark the end of the uncertainty about the toxic assets.</p> <p>The Dow Jones industrial index, the key barometer of Wall Street, collapsed after the Republicans refused to endorse the plan at about 7pm last night London time. As horse trading began to try to convince the Republican members of the Senate to support the bail-out, Wall Street endured a rollercoaster ride.</p> <p>The Dow Jones industrial average slumped by 777 points while the technology-dominated Nasdaq index suffered its biggest one-day percentage loss since 2000.</p> <p>TJ Marta, fixed-income strategist with RBC Capital Markets in New York, said: \"Last week we wrote that 'failure was not an option', as failure to pass it would precipitate a renewed meltdown in financial markets. Congress apparently doesn't understand the stakes.The only ray of light is that the horse trading is not over and some of the no-voters could switch.\" </p> <p>London markets were closed when the rejection came through. But futures contracts indicated that the FTSE 100 index of leading shares would open more than 250 points lower. The drop would come on top of the eighth largest fall in London, recorded yesterday after a turbulent day of trading following the nationalisation of Bradford &amp; Bingley and a wave of banking collapses across Europe and the US. The FTSE 100 lost 5% of its value to close at 4818 before the drama in the US.</p> <p>Stephen Berte, of Standard Life in Boston, was stunned. \"I can't believe they [Congress] weren't able to come together to come up with a solution. Complete disaster was predicted if it didn't pass. I can't see what the upside is right now.\"</p>",
  "<p>The rejection of the US government's $700bn rescue plan by the House of Representatives threw the international markets into yet another panic last night, causing a fresh plunge in shares. The Dow fell almost 600 points in a matter of minutes, opening a new nightmarish chapter in a saga that is looking more desperate by the hour. Representatives ignored pleas both from their president and from bipartisan negotiations. This has become a crisis of confidence in the banking system as a whole, which is unprecedented in modern times. It will require some equally unprecedented doomsday political manoeuvres to pull events back from the cliff edge.</p> <p>Last night's events threw a deep shadow over George Osborne's impressive Conservative conference speech yesterday. There was much to disagree with; many contradictions; an absence of detail; and, most worryingly of all, an unpersuasive grasp of what is needed now as markets crash and more banks face being blown over like trees in a storm. Neither his focus on long-term debt nor his three-card conjuring trick with council tax will ease the financial crisis now. He talked of what he would do as chancellor from 2010, without saying what he would do tonight. This was the speech of a man raising his eyes from the immediate to the moment he thinks will come, as chancellor of the exchequer in a Conservative government, facing the darkest of times. In those terms, it was a success: austere and defining. </p> <p>Echoing Anthony Crosland, he warned that \"the party is over\". Politicians everywhere are struggling to keep pace with what is happening to their world: the things that they took for granted - growth, credit, prosperity - are vanishing. Of course, Mr Osborne was as bamboozled as anyone by the magic of the City. High finance runs through Tory veins and it underwrites Tory activities, as reports that its leaders raise money from short-sellers show. Many will find it rich now to hear Mr Osborne lecture the City on responsibility, or to tell the nation that a debt-driven property boom must end, when Tory deregulation helped begin it </p> <p>But maybe this is to miss the point of what he risked yesterday, betting that voters will share his instinct that this is a time for a touch of brutal economy. His target was the public sector. He shifted the Conservatives from the sunny goodwill of David Cameron's first years to a tougher message that many will find distasteful. In doing that he may have offered Labour an opportunity, to say that the Conservative goal is to reduce the size of the state, and with it services that voters elected a Labour government to provide. Mr Osborne's talk of \"sound money\" and his claim that \"the cupboard is bare\" will play well with those who already have capital. It may prove painful for those who do not. Even yesterday's offer of a council tax freeze will not be cost free. It means a reduction in real terms in council spending. Gordon Brown has been looking for ways to define the next election around Tory cuts in services at a time when people need them most. Yesterday's speech made that easier.</p> <p>Perhaps, as Mr Osborne has decided, a much bigger change is taking place; that Labour language about investment no longer resonates with a public afraid of personal financial pain. If that is right, the contradictions in what he said may not matter. A party that preaches localism is proposing to centralise more local spending; a party that talks of the environment wants to cut car taxes; a party worried about a property boom is suggesting cutting property taxes; a shadow chancellor expert at dissecting Labour misjudgment does not admit his own. Mr Osborne does not have a plan: but then nor does anyone else, especially after the events in the US last night. It is a wretched thought, but perhaps realism is all that can be hoped for. This was a bleak speech for bleak times, growing bleaker by the hour.</p>",
  "<p>It ought to be reassuring that while governments are living a day-to-day existence trying to prevent a global financial implosion, some people are thinking centuries ahead. The British Library is hosting a conference of more than 250 experts from 33 countries to work out ways of preserving for future generations the huge amounts of data we store online. Since practically everything we write or watch these days is in digital form - from newspapers or state documents, to the minutes of the banking crisis or the latest edition of Grand Theft Auto - this is a task of mind-boggling proportions. According to the International Data Corporation, the \"digital universe\" will expand from 116 exabytes (one exabyte equals a billion gigabytes) in 2006 to 1,800 exabytes by 2011. By then it is expected that half of all content created online will fall by the wayside. No one has yet found the digital equivalent of the Rosetta Stone, which can be read almost as clearly today as it was in 196BC, but real progress is being made thanks to international collaboration. This covers everything from agreeing on the underlying standards infrastructure to redirecting people stymied by a message such as \"Error 404\" to an earlier version of the same site. This won't cure the banking crisis, but it will enable people in future centuries to understand it better. If all goes well, we will have the capacity to preserve as many of our memories, personal and national, as we want. Only time will tell whether these will last as long as the Rosetta Stone.</p>",
  "<p>The US government's $700bn emergency bail-out of the banking industry collapsed in disarray tonight as Congress voted against the plan, sending Wall Street stocks plummeting and spreading ripples of shock through the global financial markets. </p> <p>Despite a round-the-clock weekend negotiating session, members of the House of Representatives ignored a last-ditch appeal from George Bush by rejecting the rescue scheme on an initial count by 228 votes to 205.</p> <p>As Congressional leaders went back to the drawing board, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged on fears of further banking failures.</p> <p>The blue-chip average closed down 7%, a 778 points drop which exceeds its biggest ever previous one-day points fall of 684 in September 2001.</p> <p>The dramatic and unexpected show of political opposition came largely from the Republican benches, where a majority of congressmen opposed the measure citing concern among the public about the cost of the bail-out. The White House said Bush was \"very disappointed\" by the outcome. </p> <p>The Republican leader in the House, John Boehner, pledged that political leaders would continue looking for a solution which could satisfy all sides. </p> <p>\"We put everything we had into getting the votes to get there today,\" he said. \"I think we need to renew our efforts to find a solution that Congress can support.\" </p> <p>On Wall Street, there were audible groans as traders gathered around television monitors to watch the vote playing out. </p> <p>\"Everybody just stood their with their mouths open,\" said Sal Catrini, an executive director at JP Morgan in New York, who predicted that uncertainty would send stocks falling even further. \"We're seeing real selling but no buyers.\" </p> <p>The price of oil plummeted by more than $6 per barrel on concern that commercial activity would wane, the dollar shrunk on worries about the future of the US economy and the price of gold leapt by 3% as investors sought safe havens from the storm. </p> <p>In London, where the market closed before the outcome of the vote became clear, the FTSE 100 index dropped by 5.3%, shedding 269 points to close at 4,818. </p> <p>But in New York, major indices were down even further. The technology-dominated Nasdaq exchange was heading for its biggest drop since September 2001 with a fall of 6.3%, while the broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index dropped by 6%. </p> <p>Lawmakers' negative vote came in spite of a spate of reminders of the fragility of the financial industry. Following the British government's nationalisation of Bradford &amp; Bingley over the weekend, a US bank, Wachovia, was rescued from the brink of collapse by Citigroup today and the Icelandic government stepped in to rescue one of its leading banks. </p> <p>The Democratic leader in the House, Barney Frank, said he would assess the economic reaction before deciding what to do next. He blamed Republicans for \"killing\" the bail-out. But conservatives said the Democratic speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, had caused ill-will by making a \"partisan\" speech in the closing hours of a debate on the plan. </p> <p>The bail-out was conceived as a government fund to buy up toxic mortgage-related securities which have poisoned the balance sheet of leading banks, causing the collapse of Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns and threatening other Wall Street institutions. </p> <p>Over the weekend, leaders from both parties packed the plan with concessions in an attempt to win over sceptics. The Democrats inserted limits to pay packets for senior banking executives while the Republicans won the creation of a state-sponsored insurance scheme intended to guarantee against future defaults. </p> <p>The Congressional vote amounts to a shattering defeat for Bush and for the treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, and will further undermine the White House's credibility in Bush's last months in office. </p> <p>In an early morning address, Bush had appealed for approval from Congress: \"With this strong and decisive legislation, we will help restart the flow of credit, so American families can meet their daily needs and American businesses can make purchases, ship goods, and meet their payrolls.\"</p>",
  "<p>After the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the takeover of Merrill Lynch, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley being forced to become deposit-holding institutions, traditional investment banks do not exist anymore.</p> <p>Why couldn't the powerful investment banks defend themselves? The main reason is the high risk/high return investment model they have adopted. Buying, re-packaging and selling mortgage loans exposed these financial powerhouses to debts worth much much more than their assets. Risks accumulated, which ultimately exposed the banks to the instability of the market with explosive effects.</p> <p>Didn't investment bankers understand the risks? Of course they did. New financial instruments are not a magic solution. They shift risks around, but do not eliminate them. The clever and experienced investment bankers of Wall Street weren't blind to the inherent dangers of sub-prime loans. But with the attraction of potentially high rewards and personal incentives, they chose to ignore them.</p> <p>The controversy surrounding the US government's $700bn <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/19/marketturmoil.usa\">rescue plan</a> is therefore understandable. Although President Bush emphasised the effort is to save the economy from total collapse, the fact that irresponsible \"adventurers\" are to be bailed out by the state after huge personal gains does not go down well with the taxpayers.</p> <p>In contrast to Wall Street's reckless approach, Chinese banks have been behaving extremely cautiously. Although <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_financial_system\">China's financial system</a> has undergone market reforms, they have not been fundamental enough. The banks' investment decisions and administration are still heavily influenced by government intervention. The bankers consider themselves more like bureaucrats than business people. Whether a bank they run makes $10bn or $100bn is less important than keeping their jobs. There are no rewards for making large profits, but losing their position means a corresponding loss in status and pension. As a result, bankers are often overcautious: no revenue is better than taking the wrong decision.</p> <p>Another reason Chinese banks have avoided big losses is that the banking system is not yet integrated into the international monetary system. This in some way shelters it from the global turbulence. Had China's banks been allowed to operate unrestrainedly, I'm sure they would have incurred substantially more losses than they did.</p> <p>Although it has avoided taking a big hit during the current crisis, I don't think China's banking system should stay as it is now. The mentality of over-emphasising safety may avoid some risks, but the price we pay is less efficiency. China should not shy away from pushing market reforms, encouraging innovation, improving incentives and reducing deterrents in its banking system. Our banks are starting to conduct more global transactions. The key to success will be freeing the system up, while maintaining proper risk controls and management.</p>",
  "<p>With the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/30/business/30bailout.html?hp\">failure</a> today of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/29/wallstreet.marketturmoil\">$700bn economic bail-out package</a> before Congress, the Reagan Revolution died. Allowing this crisis to continue without any viable alternative represents the end of an era for the Republican party. With uncertainty growing in a market built on expectations, our economic woes will worsen. Ironically, as this crisis expands and continues to collapse major corporations, Americans will demand greater government intervention. A party whose platform opposes nearly any proposal that uses government as the medicine for a financial disease will not be able to survive this crisis.</p> <p>Politicians voted today by putting their fingers to the wind, and used ideology rather than expert advice to determine their position. John McCain, who recently gave himself credit for suspending his campaign and shoring up House Republican support for the bill, boarded his plane without comment upon hearing of the bill's failure. And while Main Street's short-term cynicism about Bush's proposal may have been satisfied, such reservations on the part of the public was the result of a poor marketing job by an unpopular president, and ultimately Americans will hold accountable politicians who are seen as failing to rescue them from this crisis.</p> <p>America is waking up to the fact that the brand of laissez-faire capitalism that has guided America since the Reagan Revolution is a farce. Everyone was saying it, but no businessperson really believed in it when it came to their own family. As Paul Krugman recently remarked: \"Just as there are no atheists in foxholes, there are no libertarians in a financial crisis.\" Few people are willing to allow 35% unemployment and economic disaster to stand firm on the very principles that likely triggered this mess. It is true that over the long run, even if we did nothing America's markets would recover, and we would once again enjoy prosperity. But as John Maynard Keynes pointed out during our last great financial disaster: <a href=\"http://www.bartleby.com/66/8/32508.html\">\"In the long run, we're all dead.\"</a> <br> If you listen to the politicians and pundits, we are not supposed to blame the economic philosophy that has deregulated the markets and made financial industry lobbyists the prime architects of the very legislation designed to oversee their businesses. Instead, Americans are supposed to view this financial collapse as a disaster which was the fault of greedy people and irresponsible consumers. They used bad judgment. But where is the sense in this analysis? We are blaming consumers for trying to get easy credit, and financial institutions for trying to make lots of money. Is that not how the system was supposed to work? How can we second-guess willing sellers and willing buyers who purchased mortgage-backed securities at their market rate? Their risk, their reward \u2013 but apparently not their loss. The invisible hand seems all too obviously elitist. The rich are in trouble, so we act. The poor have been in trouble since the beginning of time, but that's just background noise on our walk to work. For the first time since 9/11, I've seen a president who has finally set aside his ideology and tried to govern. George Bush understands, at long last, that he cannot be remembered as being the 21st century's Herbert Hoover. Perhaps it is the sense of his legacy dawning upon him in the twilight hours of his presidency, but no one of sound mind is willing to allow financial institutions of the magnitude of AIG to collapse and trigger a <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2008/09/14/news/economy/greenspan/index.htm\">once-in-a-century </a> economic decline. <br> No one, apparently, but House Republicans, who killed a bill that Wall Street felt was necessary to cure this economic crisis, causing the market to plunge more than 400 points in 10 minutes. Fiscal conservatives tried and failed to make the central component of the bailout a combination of deregulation and tax cuts. While on paper giving financial institutions a temporary capital gains tax cut seems like a serious proposal, fiscal policy and regulatory changes are medium to long-term solutions that would do nothing to infuse cash into the system in the short term. This would have done very little to shore up confidence before the markets opened around the world this week, nor would it address the original sin of mortgage-backed securities.</p> <p>To address this problem, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/27/business/27plan.html?_r=1&amp;ref=business&amp;oref=slogin\">House Republicans pushed for an insurance programme</a> that could be used by the Treasury secretary, even though he has reportedly shown no interest in using such a tool. Such a proposal can hardly be characterised as anything other than a face-saving measure that does little to dampen the impact of a $700bn bail-out deal. How can fiscal conservatives explain to their constituents that in time of serious economic crisis, their philosophy simply is not a practical short-term solution? It seems that while Republicans can spin \"victory\" in Iraq, they cannot spin \"profit\" on Wall Street.<br> While no one can yet suggest America is on the verge of a second New Deal, paradigm shifts are often not obviously apparent at the time they occur. The second phase of the government's response to this crisis will involve regulatory overhaul. Congress will have to hold hearings on the cause of this disaster and they will no doubt find many instances of deregulation as the culprit. In 1982, Ronald Reagan pushed for the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garn_-_St_Germain_Depository_Institutions_Act\">Garn-St Germain Depository Institutions Act</a>, which in Title VIII specifically provided for the very adjustable-rate mortgages that have left consumers struggling to make their payments. They will find that in 1999 it was senator Phil Graham and a veto-proof Republican majority that demanded an overhaul of the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 which separated commercial and investment banking. This might have contained this problem to one sector of the lending industry. Investigators will find that in 2000, Republicans and free market ideologues passed the Commodities Futures Modernisation Act which reduced transparency in the derivatives market. As Congress fulfils its oversight role, a picture will emerge of a comprehensive deregulation strategy which led to this crisis. <br> The end of the Reagan Revolution would not mean a sharp turn toward socialism, but a maturation of economic policy that understands the complexity and power of large financial institutions. Corporate executives should not have the right to risk the entire American economy \u2013 indeed the global economy \u2013 as part of their portfolio management, regardless of Ayn Rand's philosophical musings. While Republicans struggle to explain how the irresponsible decisions of executives and consumers are to blame, but their own policies which afforded them this opportunity are not, one wonders about the legacy of Reagan's economic policies. It seems that in a time of serious economic crisis, Americans will turn to Roosevelt rather than Reagan. Doing nothing simply isn't an option, and tax cuts and deregulation in a time of corporate excess makes little sense. It is only natural to wonder if this is more than a temporary shift in political discourse.</p>",
  "<p>Sarah Palin was set to enter the confines of John McCain's ranch in Arizona today for three days of intensive preparations ahead of her showdown against Joe Biden in this week's vice-presidential television debate. Thursday night's match in St Louis, Missouri, will bring McCain's running mate her moment of greatest national exposure since the virtual unknown joined the Republican ticket for the White House.</p> <p>Though vice-presidential debates seldom influence an election, Palin's novelty raises the importance of the clash with her Democratic party counterpart. The debate offers a chance for her to redeem herself after a number of damaging press reports and disastrous TV interviews - or to self-destruct if she fails to hold her own against the far more experienced Biden.</p> <p>In a parting shot before she entered the seclusion of the ranch for the debate rehearsals, Palin told a rally in Columbus, Ohio, today that she was excited about the encounter. \"I'm looking forward to meeting Joe Biden. I've been hearing about him since second grade,\" she said.</p> <p>But the bravado belies the intense pressure on Palin to deliver a credible performance, and the efforts campaign aides have made to get her up to speed. A team of senior aides has been at her side for days, hunkering down in Philadelphia at the weekend and travelling with her today.</p> <p>At first glance, the debate might look like an unequal fight. Biden has been a ubiquitous figure in Washington for 36 years; Palin was virtually unknown outside her native Alaska until 33 days ago. A Wall Street Journal poll last week found that 49% of Americans thought Palin fit to be vice-president, against 64% for Biden.</p> <p>But Biden faces challenges as well in the first national debate between male and female candidates since Geraldine Ferraro ran for vice-president in 1984. He has been rehearsing against Jennifer Granholm, the governor of Michigan, to prepare for the gender dynamics.</p> <p>\"[Palin] has to show command of her material. She has to show preparedness to take on the presidency, and she has to show more intellectual gravitas than she has shown so far,\" said Alan Schroeder, a professor at North Eastern University who has written a book about 40 years of presidential debates. \"[Biden] has the problem of high expectations versus his opponent's low expectations.\"</p> <p>Though wildly popular with hardcore Republicans, Palin has become a butt of late-night comics for her insistence that Alaska's proximity to Russia gives her some insight into international affairs.</p> <p>The conservative commentator David Brooks called her candidacy \"embarrassing\" and Newsweek's Fareed Zakaria said her answers on the economy in a CBS interview last week were \"gibberish\".</p> <p>Today even Mitt Romney, a former Republican candidate for the White House, admitted that the campaign had mishandled Palin by keeping her from the media and trying to make her stick to scripted answers. \"Holding Sarah Palin to just three interviews and microscopically focusing on each I think has been a mistake,\" he told MSNBC. \"They'd be a lot wiser to let Sarah Palin be Sarah Palin. Let her talk to the media, talk to people.\"</p> <p>Palin's claim to be a crusader for reform has also been shaken by further investigation into her record in Alaska. The Associated Press reported today that Palin got exemption from zoning regulations to make it easier to sell her home in Wasilla. As a small town mayor, she made it a habit to accept gifts such as a facial, flowers and even fresh salmon from local merchants.</p> <p>Palin also faces questions about policy splits. Unlike McCain, she supports drilling in the Arctic wildlife refuge and only recently admitted a human role in global warming. She also opposes stem cell research, which McCain supports.</p> <p>Such differences could prove embarrassing to Biden as well. When he was running for the White House earlier this year, Biden said he did not think Obama was ready to be president.</p> <p>He has broken with the campaign on clean coal technology, and committed a number of gaffes. Earlier this month, he embarrassed Obama and himself by saying that Hillary Clinton would have made a better vice-presidential candidate.</p> <p>But perhaps his greatest challenge is to guard against being perceived as overbearing or condescending to a younger female candidate. This is especially true in the case of Palin, whose relative inexperience could make women viewers feel protective of her.</p> <p>Such factors have also come into play in debates with the most seasoned women politicians. Hillary Clinton, widely considered the Democrats' best debater, won her 2000 Senate debate when her opponent, Rick Lazio, came up to her and waved a sheaf of papers in her face. The invasion of Clinton's personal space outraged women viewers and made Lazio seem like a bully.</p> <p>George Bush Sr lost his debate against Ferraro in 1984 the moment he decided to give her a lecture about the difference between Lebanon and Iran.</p> <p>Ferraro, who had several years experience as a New York prosecutor and congresswoman on her resume, would have none of it. \"I almost resent, Vice-President Bush, your patronising attitude that you have to teach me about foreign policy,\" she shot back.</p> <p>The gaffe-prone Biden would also do well to remember that Bush dug himself even deeper into the hole the next day by bragging to a bunch of dockers that he had \"kicked a little ass\" in the debate.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama is opening up a clear lead over John McCain after polls taken at the weekend showed the public overwhelmingly awarding Friday night's presidential debate to the Democratic candidate. The polls suggest that McCain gained no benefit from his impulsive actions in suspending his campaign and flying to Washington last week to help deal with the financial crisis. </p> <p>The opening gap could see an increase in more personal attacks on Obama. An early sign of that came today in a row over a dead soldier's bracelet: Obama faced claims that he has been wearing the bracelet, raised in Friday's debate, against the express wishes of the mother. </p> <p>With five weeks until the White House election, Obama appears to have broken the impasse that had seen the two in a deadheat in polls over the last month. A USA Today poll, published today, showed 45% of those surveyed felt Obama had done better in the debate than McCain, who registered only 34%. The public view is at odds with the media, who overwhelmingly judged it to be a draw. Other polls, including the Rasmussen tracking one, showed voters drifting towards Obama. A Rasmussen tracking poll puts Obama on 50% compared with McCain on 44%, which would give the Democratic candidate a landslide victory. </p> <p>McCain returned to the campaign trail today alongside his vice-presidential running mate, Sarah Palin, for the first time since suspending campaigning last Wednesday. In his speech in Ohio, McCain stuck to his main message of questioning whether Obama is fit to be president, saying the Democratic candidate had never voted other than the party line and had shown no sign of putting his country first. He directly accused him of lying in Friday's debate about tax plans. </p> <p>As the election draws closer, the two campaigns are firing back more and more claims and denials, also at increasing speed. Obama's team's denial on tax was out before McCain had completed his speech. </p> <p>If Obama maintains his lead, the Republicans are almost certain to step up personal attacks on the Democratic candidate. William Kristol, a right-wing commentator and editor of the Weekly Standard, in a column for the New York Times today offered suggestions on how McCain could win that included raising again his links with figures such as the controversial pastor, the Rev Jeremiah Wright. </p> <p>An early sign that the campaign could turn more personal was today's row over Obama's possession of the bracelet of a US soldier killed in Iraq. <br>Stories quickly appeared on the internet suggesting the mother was objecting to Obama exploiting her son's death. McCain, during the debate, said a soldier's mother gave him a bracelet. \"I've got a bracelet too, from Sergeant \u2014 from the mother of Sergeant Ryan David Jopek, given to me in Green Bay,\" Obama said. The mother, Tracy Jopek, told AP today she was \"ecstatic\" that Obama had mentioned her son during the debate. \"I don't understand how people can take that and turn it into some garbage on the internet,\" she said. She had asked Obama in February not to mention her son in speeches and debates but she felt it was appropriate on Friday in response to McCain. On Fox news today, Robert Gibbs, a senior Obama campaign adviser, denied the mother had asked Obama not to wear the bracelet. \"Let's get the facts right before we start making stuff up on the news,\" Gibbs said. A Fox presenter, Brian Kilmeade, replied testily: \"Don't say we're making stuff up!\u2026 Unbelievable\u2026 Goodbye.\"</p> <p>Both Obama and McCain have established what they refer to as truth squads, each offering quick rebuttals to what they see as incorrect claims. Both campaigns are expanding these squads, either adding more members or setting them up in new states.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown and George Bush issued a joint letter today, calling on western donors to keep promises made earlier this year to help developing countries deal with the world food price crisis. </p> <p>World leaders at a June food conference in Rome, and at a G8 summit in Hokkaido the following month, agreed to respond to soaring food prices by making long-term investments in agriculture in developing countries. </p> <p>They also said they would help pay for seeds, fertilisers and other resources African farmers would need to be able to take advantage of the high prices, by planting more crops this year. </p> <p>\"The whole idea is to help Africa feed the world rather than the world feed Africa,\" a senior British official said last night. </p> <p>But he said donor countries' contributions to a World Bank fund had so far fallen dramatically short of their promises.</p> <p>Thirty developing countries have so far come forward with short-term agricultural plans, but there is a financing shortfall of over $600m.</p> <p>Today's joint letter from the US president and Britain's prime minister points out their two countries had announced a total of roughly $5.5bn over the next two years and $1.4bn over five years respectively, to improve global food security.</p> <p>It said other countries, including rich nations from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and emerging economies \"need to do their part by ensuring \u2026that funds are quickly mobilised to pay for seeds and fertiliser in time for the next planting season\".</p> <p>The two leaders also called for urgent aid for the Horn of Africa, where the food crisis has left 17 million people in need of immediate humanitarian assistance. The UN has said it needs $700m urgently to meet the region's needs.</p> <p>\"Other countries have also responded generously, but the needs remain great and are likely to grow. We ask you to join us in meeting these pressing humanitarian needs,\" Brown and Bush wrote.</p>",
  "<p><br>A $700bn rescue plan for the sagging US financial market was defeated in Congress today, threatening to throw the already turbulent global financial markets into further disarray.</p> <p>The ambitious and risky bail-out fell short, 205-228, in the House of Representatives after an unprecedented push by both Democratic and Republican leaders to win their members' support for the deal.</p> <p>The Dow Jones industrial average plummeted by more than 5% as the 15-minute vote was stretched out to 40 minutes as Democratic leaders made a last-ditch attempt to change minds.</p> <p>But with the November election approaching, members of both parties were leery of giving the Bush administration sweeping new authority to save Wall Street firms. The fear of taking blame for an unsuccessful bail-out appeared to motivate many opponents.</p> <p>George Bush was \"very disappointed\" by the House failure today, spokesman Tony Fratto told reporters. The president will be meeting with advisers later to devise another plan for the bail-out, he added.</p> <p>\"We're all worried about losing our jobs,\" Paul Ryan, a conservative congressman and early critic of the rescue proposal, told colleagues before the vote. </p> <p>\"Most of us say, 'I want this thing to pass, but I want you to vote for it, not me'.\"</p> <p>Today's failure leaves Henry Paulson's strategy in tatters after 10 days of intense negotiations on a plan to allow the government to buy up risky mortgage-based assets. The US treasury secretary, must now find a new approach to curtailing the credit crisis.</p> <p>Not even a mind-boggling collapse in the stock market was enough to marshal support from the majority of the House. As the stunning vote unfolded, members shouted \"Order!\" in a plea to deal the financial rescue a death knell.</p> <p>After the vote, Republicans sought to pin blame on Democratic House speaker Nancy Pelosi, accusing her of taking an improperly partisan tone in her speech urging members to back the bail-out.</p> <p>Since Paulson first warned Congress of coming economic doom, the bail-out has torn traditional boundaries between Republicans and Democrats. Illustrating the topsy-turvy turn of events, the Democratic chairman of the financial services committee made an extraordinary appeal to liberals: obey the Bush administration.</p> <p>\"If we repudiate George Bush's secretary of the treasury and chairman of the Federal Reserve, if we repudiate them and say, 'Nah, calm down, we'll get over it,' I believe the consequences will be severe,\" Representative Barney Frank told his colleagues.</p> <p>Frank and other congressional leaders worked around the clock on the weekend to finalise a bail-out before markets opened today.</p> <p>Their rush could not stave off the latest day of financial shock, however. The FTSE 100 experienced a similar downturn, suffering a 5.3% drop that was the eighth largest in its history. The German DAX index fell 3.9% as the French CAC-40 index dropped 4.9%.</p> <p>Bush made another appeal to Congress today, urging legislators to approve the plan in order to avert further financial turmoil worldwide.</p> <p>\"This plan sends a strong signal to markets around the world that the United States is serious about restoring confidence and stability to our financial system,\" Bush said late yesterday. \"Without this rescue plan the costs to the American economy could be disastrous.\"</p> <p>The new bail-out deal was reached after Paulson allowed major changes aimed at ensuring the government could recoup its massive investment in the market.</p> <p>But the addition of a financial oversight board, limits on executive pay, and the disbursement of the $700bn in several instalments was not enough to win over conservative Republicans. They remained bitterly critical of the bail-out, describing it as a first step to socialising the capitalist economy.</p> <p>\"I believe that this plan is fraught with unintended consequences \u2026 and could permanently and fundamentally change the role of government in the American free enterprise system,\" Jeb Hensarling, the Republican congressman who led bail-out foes on the right, said in a statement.</p> <p>Dozens of liberals also opposed the rescue plan as lacking needed help for homeowners facing foreclosure and bankruptcy.</p> <p>The House could return to reconsider the bail-out as soon as tomorrow. The earliest it could receive a vote in the Senate is Wednesday, due to a recess for the Jewish New Year.</p> <p>Both John McCain and Barack Obama have released statements supporting the bail-out deal and both candidates have vowed to leave the campaign trail to cast a vote on the bail-out.</p>",

If you pay yourselves sums far beyond what anyone else in other walks of life earns then be prepared to lose it when you make mistakes,\" he said. \"I will not increase taxes on families earning \u00a320,000 a year to pay the bonuses of bankers earning \u00a32m.\"</p> <p>Osborne said that Britain needed a \"wholly different plan\", as set out in the Conservatives' economic recovery document published yesterday.</p> <p>Under the proposals, the Tories would set up an independent office for budget responsibility to keep track of the public finances and set out changes to tax and spending plans necessary to slash debt.</p> <p>The Bank of England would be given a bigger role in market oversight, with a new requirement on it to make regular assessments of the market-wide risk caused by debt.</p> <p>That would be used by the Financial Services Authority to regulate lending by individual financial institutions.</p> <p>But Yvette Cooper, the chief secretary to the Treasury, claimed that Osborne had had blown his chance to say what the Tories would do about <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/sep/29/bradfordbingley.banking5\">Bradford &amp; Bingley</a> and the huge problems facing the global financial system.</p> <p>\"We heard nothing about how they would deal with the greatest financial shock to hit the world for decades,\" she said.</p> <p>Turning to the council tax announcement, Cooper added: \"George Osborne's council tax pledge is a con. It could only be introduced if local councils make big cuts in public services. They have failed to set out where any savings would come from.\"<br> Osborne told the conference: \"We are going into partnership with local councils. If they find matched savings in their town hall, we will give them these savings from Whitehall \u2026 Every council tax bill of every family in every council that takes part will be frozen.</p> <p>\"Instead of council tax bills that rise year after year under Labour, millions of families will get help at the time they need it most.\"</p> <p>Since Labour came to power, average band D council tax has more than doubled, rising from \u00a3688 in 1997 to \u00a31,374 now.</p> <p>Under the Tory plan, any local authority that kept its council tax increases to 2.5% or below would be able to reclaim that amount from central government, in effect allowing them to freeze bills for taxpayers.</p> <p>The Tories would fund this by cutting Whitehall spending on consultants and advertising by \u00a3500m in the first year, and \u00a31bn in subsequent years, they said. </p> <p>Elsewhere, on the conference fringe, Oliver Letwin, the Conservative's policy chief, claimed David Cameron could be seen as the heir to Tony Blair because the Tory chief wanted to do \"exactly\" the same as the former prime minister in key policy areas. </p> <p>Letwin praised Lord Adonis, the schools minister, for pushing forward the government's ambitious academies programme and admitted that many of the structures needed to improve education, welfare and the health service had already been put in place by Blairites.</p> <p>And in a separate move, Michael Gove, the shadow schools secretary and close Cameron ally, said a Conservative government would be ready to work with figures from the Liberal Democrats and Labour right to make sure it was able to put its policies into effect.</p> <p>He also singled out Adonis for praise, along with his opposite number in the Liberal Democrats, David Laws, James Purnell, the work and pensions secretary, and former cabinet ministers Alan Milburn and Stephen Byers.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/29/bradfordbingley.banking5\">State intervention and nationalisation</a>are both back with an incredible bang. Suddenly, the neoliberal orthodoxy of \"Tina\" \u2013 <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TINA\">\"there is no alternative\"</a> \u2013 to the free market looks as hollow as Brown's promise to end the cycle of boom and bust. It reconfirms that in this age of hyper-globalisation and neoliberalism, the state and market regulation are still important.</p> <p>The bail-outs we've seen in Britain and the US are nationalisations by the neoliberals and for the bosses. If they were carried out at the behest of the left and for the workers, taxpayers and citizens, they would look entirely different.</p> <p>So when the senior management was changed when <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7249575.stm\">Northern Rock</a> was nationalised one set of capitalist managers was merely replaced by another. The same will be true of Bradford &amp; Bingley. The nationalisations were not to safeguard jobs or workers' conditions or people's savings but the British financial system upon which profits heavily depend. </p> <p>If the left is to make headway right now, it must start getting its ideas about public ownership out into the media, into union members' heads and onto people's radar screens.</p> <p>The left needs to start off with what public ownership is and what it is not. This would make it clear the left was not calling for a return to the age of nationalisation, where civil servants ran the industries in an undemocratic and unaccountable ways. Jobs were not safeguarded and services were often poor. It would also make it clear the left was not calling for a situation of a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_economy\">command economy</a>, where the centre dictated what was produced without consulting the consumers and the localities.</p> <p>The lessons of history are that while coordination and planning are needed, there should be decentralised structures that allow participation and that the process is one of bottom-up democracy, not top-down diktat. </p> <p>One model of public ownership, for say, transport would be that the boards of management consist of a third of seats allocated to representatives from the travelling public, a third from the workforce and a third from the local authorities. Here, there would be a balance between producer and consumer interests.</p> <p>The issues to be resolved would include whether the unions would be the only representatives of the workforce, whether businesses would be entitled to seats and whether local authorities are closely connected enough to be the genuine representatives of the public at large. </p> <p>Another model would be that all members of the board of management would be elected directly by citizens and those wishing to be board members stand on platforms of representing workers', business and passengers' interests and so on. </p> <p>These are all issues which can be explored in more depth later once the debate has been won on the need for this version of public ownership. The key thing here is that the primary purpose of these services (including financial services) being in public ownership would be that they are run on the basis of social need and not private profit.</p> <p>What this means is that the constitution or articles of association of these organisations would be changed from the objective of pursuing private shareholder interests to providing services. The organisations would not then have to be concerned with chasing profits, market value, market share or being taken over by a rival.</p> <p>The banks would then operate under this system by creating social justice and social inclusion by keeping open wide branch networks (with one in each community), practice safe lending, work by the principles of ethical investment and return surplus back into their operations to increase service provision. </p> <p>The way in which the left can do this is by questioning each and every action of the governments by saying \"Whose interests are being served by this?\", \"Whose money is being used for this?\" and \"If public money is being used, where is the public control?\" </p> <p>There is a role for left MPs like <a href=\"www.johnmcdonnell.org.uk/\">John McDonnell</a> in laying bills before parliament to put organisations into public ownership instead of allowing this Labour government to remain the bankers' friend by doling out hand outs to them. </p> <p>The unions need to use their influence inside and outside parliament to support these moves.

  "<p>The <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/ftse\">FTSE 100</a></strong> suffered one of the biggest one-day declines in its history yesterday, taking the index back below where it was before its record-breaking rally 10 days ago.</p> <p>The list of London's top 100 shares tumbled 269.7 points, a 5.3% fall that was the eighth worst on record, amid a Europe-wide sell-off of banking stocks and early declines on Wall Street.</p> <p>That meant it ended the day at 4818.8 points, taking it below the level it reached before September 19, when the US's planned bail-out of toxic debts eased the panic in world markets and handed the index its biggest ever gain.</p> <p>Just one stock \u2013 the supermarket group <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/morrisons\">Wm Morrison</a></strong> \u2013 managed to stay in positive territory on a bruising day of trading.<br> Banks were the main casualties, hit by the triple whammy of <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/bradfordbingley\">Bradford &amp; Bingley</a></strong>'s nationalisation, the bail-out of European bank Fortis and the nationalisation of Iceland's third largest bank, Glitnir.</p> <p>NatWest owner, <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/royalbankofscotlandgroup\">Royal Bank of Scotland</a></strong>, slumped 13% to 181p, down 27p, having slipped as low as 163p at one point. <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/lloydstsbgroup\">Lloyds TSB</a></strong> dropped 13.5% or 33.75p to 217.25p, while <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/hbosbusiness\">HBOS</a></strong> fell more than 18%, down 31.3p to 142p. <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/barclay\">Barclays</a></strong> was only slightly better off, down 8.8% or 32.25p to 334.25p.</p> <p>Despite the banking sector's heavy slide, the FTSE 100's biggest percentage faller was <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/icap\">Icap</a></strong>, the interdealer broker run by Conservative party treasurer, Michael Spencer. Icap shares fell almost 24%, despite saying group revenue in the six months to September 30 was expected to be up by a fifth on the same period last year. Analysts pointed to doubts about the company's future profit growth as the shares closed at 289.25p, down 89.25p.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/mangroup\">Man Group</a></strong>, the world's biggest listed hedge fund manager, was another major casualty, ending the day down more than 18% or 68.25p at 305.5p.</p> <p>There were steep declines among the miners amid falling commodity prices and continuing fears for the health of the global economy. <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/lonmin\">Lonmin</a></strong>, which announced the departure of its chief executive, Brad Mills, saw shares drop 14.6% to close down \u00a33.61 at \u00a321.08. This was well short of the \u00a333 potential offer made last month by its rival Xstrata. Shares in Xstrata, which has until Thursday to clarify its intentions towards Lonmin, slipped 17.5% or \u00a33.34 to \u00a315.78. <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/enrc\">Eurasian Natural Resources</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/kazakhmys\">Kazahmys</a></strong> both experienced 15% declines, the former down 85.75p to 473.25p and the latter dropping 98p to 567p.</p> <p>Travel group <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/thomascookgroup\">Thomas Cook</a></strong> ended the day flat at 202.75p, after its main shareholder, the German group Arcandor, said it would not be selling its 52% stake. Thomas Cook also said it was abandoning talks about a potential merger of its airline, Condor, with rival operation Germanwings.</p> <p>Advertising group WPP was one of the day's many fallers, sliding 34.5p to 439.25p.

  "<p>British confectionary company, Cadbury, has recalled Chinese-made chocolate after finding it contained melamine, as the scandal over tainted milk continued to develop.</p> <p>The firm said today it was withdrawing 11 products as a precautionary measure. More than 50,000 children have been taken ill after drinking baby formula laced with the substance.</p> <p>Melamine has been found in fresh dairy products, biscuits and sweets since news of the contamination became public. But, to date, all cases of illness have been linked to Sanlu, the milk powder company at the heart of the scare.</p> <p>A spokesman for Cadbury said preliminary tests had shown traces of the substance in chocolates made in Beijing and sold in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. One product was exported to Australia.</p> <p>\"We believe it is appropriate to take a precautionary step to withdraw from the market all of our Cadbury chocolate products that have been manufactured in Beijing, pending further supply of fresh products,\" the company said in a statement.</p> <p>\"In support of our commitment to the highest standards of quality and safety, Cadbury is putting in place additional checks and procedures.\"<br>It added that no Chinese dairy products are used in chocolate made elsewhere.</p> <p>Experts from the World Health Organisation say traces of melamine are relatively common in food, which can acquire it from packaging or the environment. They add that only high concentrations pose a risk to health and that small children are more vulnerable than adults.</p> <p>The chemical is often used in making plastics and fertiliser. While it should not be used in food, it boosts apparent protein levels in tests, disguising substandard or watered-down milk.</p> <p>Two US manufacturers are investigating Indonesian claims that high traces of the industrial chemical have been found in Chinese-made Oreos, M&amp;Ms and Snickers, but stressed the same goods had tested negative in other Asian countries.</p> <p>Kraft Foods and Mars said they would adhere to Indonesia's recall order, but said wanted to conduct their own checks. They said they were looking into all possibilities, including counterfeiting.</p> <p>Yesterday, the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, promised to improve Chinese food safety, but added: \"When this kind of problem of food safety occurs, we do not cover it up. We face it candidly and have taken bold moves to address it.\"</p> <p>Parents began complaining to Sanlu about a possible link as early as the end of 2007, and doctors suspected a connection from spring this year.<br>While the central government says it only learned of the problem in<br>September, city officials in Shijiazhuang, Hebei, knew of the contamination for over a month before raising the alarm. Several have since been fired.</p> <p>Sanlu was a major employer in the city and the province was under intense pressure to ensure a trouble-free Olympic games because it is next door to Beijing.</p> <p>\"The Olympics provided a political excuse to cover this up, and when that excuse disappeared, the problem kept growing and had to come out,\" said Zhang Ming, a historian and political commentator at Renmin University in Beijing who has written on the scandal.</p> <p>\"At a time when stability was an absolute priority, [officials] made a<br>choice\", he told Reuters. \"Food safety is important, but stability concerns the survival of the Party. Officials naturally assumed their own survival came first.\"</p> <p>The government is now playing down the scandal and Chinese lawyers and advocates who have promised to help the families of sick children seek redress say they are facing pressure to abandon the efforts from officials in some provinces.</p> <p>\"About two dozen of the lawyers have called these past days to say they want to quit the volunteer advice group,\" Li Fangping, a Beijing lawyer who helped organise the group, told Reuters. </p> <p>\"Some of them said that they or their offices were told they'd face serious repercussions if they stayed involved.\"</p>",
  "<p>Channel Five owner <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/rtl\">RTL</a> and the private equity market are the most likely contenders to buy <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/bskyb\">BSkyB</a>'s shares in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/ITV\">ITV</a>, analysts say.</p> <p>The satellite broadcaster's stake, which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/sep/29/bskyb.itv\">the Competition Appeal Tribunal has said must be sold down from 17.9% to less than 7.5%</a>, was acquired for \u00a3940m in November 2006 to block any attempt by Virgin Media to take over ITV.</p> <p>Analysts believe that ITV, which has a market capitalisation of \u00a31.77bn, is highly unlikely to be the target of a takeover bid. Financial buyers will struggle to raise the necessary financing for any deal in the current turbulent markets. </p> <p>Just last week, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/19/informa.unitedbusinessmedia\">a \u00a31.9bn bid for trade publisher Informa collapsed</a> because the potential private equity buyers saw their banking facilities collapse. The financing package was being put together by Goldman Sachs.</p> <p>Numis Securities put out a note this morning pointing out that a bidder would need \"in excess of \u00a34bn\" to secure ITV.</p> <p>This includes \u00a32.5bn for ITV, at a premium of 65p per share, as well as \u00a3700m to cover the broadcaster's debt and a further \u00a31bn for a pension debt buyout.</p> <p>BSkyB's ITV stake, or part of it, would still prove to be an important strategic bridgehead for the longer-term option of a takeover when market conditions sweeten.</p> <p>\"I don't think there will be an immediate buyer [for the stake], however, over the next nine months there is a 40% chance that either RTL/Bertelsmann or private equity will buy the stake,\" said one analyst.</p> <p>RTL, which states that it wants to be number one or two in each European major market, is described as a credible suitor.</p> <p>However funds are tight in the current market and Bertelsmann, which owns about 90% of RTL, is seen as a more likely buyer of the stake.</p> <p>Mediaset, the Italian media empire controlled by the country's prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, is also interested. Also mooted as possible bidders are Haim Saban, the media entrepreneur behind Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, and a number of private equity and financial buyers including Apax and Goldman Sachs, which tried to buy ITV two years ago. </p> <p>Despite the tough conditions for raising funding one analyst said \"not to rule out\" a potential bid from the private equity sector looking to get a cheap stake with the hope of cashing in later.</p> <p>\"ITV is in a highly cyclical market and going into 2009 the market looks very bad,\" said an analyst at one investment bank. \"The most likely scenario is a trade buyer, in a better ad market, and it must get better than this, ITV is worth a lot more\".</p> <p>Global production company Endemol's debt position, compared with operating profits, is seen as unfavourable for seeking a deal.</p> <p>At the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/mediaguardianedinburghinternationaltelevisionfestival2008\">MediaGuardian Edinburgh International TV Festival</a>, former Channel Five chief executive David Elstein and Kelvin MacKenzie argued that an international media company would need to step in to save ITV.</p> <p>Disney is the only US company analysts believe has a potential interest, given the current market.</p> <p>BSkyB's 696m shares in ITV are worth about \u00a3300m at a share price of about 44p.</p> <p>However, a suitor is likely to have to pay a small premium, perhaps 50p a share, meaning BSkyB may be looking for around \u00a3350m for the whole stake.</p> <p>To take the approximate 10% that BSkyB has been asked to divest, a buyer would need around \u00a3170m, according to Numis.</p> <p>In July, BSkyB made a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jul/31/bskyb.mediabusiness\">\u00a3616m non-cash accounting impairment charge</a> on its 17.9% stake in ITV. </p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p>The publisher whose home was targeted in a firebomb attack on Saturday will be going ahead with putting out a controversial novel about the child bride of Muhammad next month, despite this weekend's events.</p> <p>London-based Gibson Square acquired journalist Sherry Jones's novel The Jewel of Medina earlier this month after Random House US dropped the novel following warnings that it could provoke terrorist actions from radical Muslims.</p> <p>On Saturday, what is believed to have been a petrol bomb was thrown through the doorway of publisher Martin Rynja's home in Islington's Lonsdale Square, which doubles as the offices for Gibson Square. Three men have since been detained on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism.</p> <p>But Natasha Kern, Jones's agent, said \"publication is going ahead in both the US and UK. This is one of the primary reasons we chose Gibson Square and Beaufort Books - we knew they would be courageous and get the book in print quickly.\" </p> <p>The Jewel of Medina will be published on October 30 in the UK and October 15 in the US, although Jones's US publisher Beaufort Books has closed its offices today as a precautionary measure. \"They [Beaufort Books] are meeting with local law enforcement. They have not received any threats but it's as a precautionary measure,\" said a spokesman for Beaufort Books.</p> <p>Rynja himself could not be reached for comment. Speaking to the Today programme this morning, author Sherry Jones said Rynja was \"a very courageous man, a strong advocate of free speech who went into publication of this book knowing there might be controversy or perhaps even violence. He did this with his eyes wide open, and because he believes in my book and he believes in free speech.\"</p> <p>Jones criticised American academic Denise Spellberg, a professor of Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Texas, who had described the book as \"softcore pornography\" in the US media.</p> <p>\"She used the most inflammatory language she could possibly have used. If you want to incite heated emotions from any religious group you just use the word 'pornography' in the same sentence as their revered figures,\" Jones said.</p> <p>\"She ought to take back her words because it is in no way an accurate description of my book. There are no sex scenes in it.\" </p> <p>She added: \"I don't blame Denise Spellberg for this attack, I blame the people who resorted to violence. I'm sure Ms Spellberg never wanted to incite violence, in fact she said her reaons for objecting were the opposite. But I fear she has created a self-fulfilling prophecy.\"</p> <p>The Jewel of Medina is a first person narrative from the perspective of Aisha, one of Muhammad's wives. It steers clear of graphic details about the sexual relations of Aisha and Muhammad, but does touch on their love life. \"This was the beginning of something new, something terrible. Soon I would be lying on my bed beneath him, squashed like a scarab beetle, flailing and sobbing while he slammed himself against me. He would not want to hurt me, but how could he help it? It's always painful the first time.\"</p> <p>Jones had previously told the Guardian that she did not believe there was any risk of violent protests over the novel's publication. \"Frankly I'm more afraid of global warming than of terrorist attacks,\" she said. \"I did expect my book would be controversial, just because I'm a pink woman writing about a culture that was not my own and a religion that is not my own \u2026 [but] my aim was not to provoke, it was to portray the difficulty of being a woman in that era, and to portray this wonderful heroine who overcame obstacles to become a prominent figure in Islam.\"</p> <p>Jones said that she had been in contact with Rynja and that he was \"fine\". \"He's unharmed,\" she added.</p> <p>Jones said she was still planning to visit the UK for publication next month. \"My intention is that if Martin Rynja is courageous enough to proceed with publication, I am certainly courageous enough to come to Britain.\" She said she was not concerned for her safety. \"There is no indication this is the beginning of a larger movement ... It doesn't seem to me from where I sit that this was an actual assassination attempt.\"</p> <p>Jones also said she would be writing to London-based lawyer and cleric Anjem Choudhary, who has been quoted calling the book an insult to Muhammad's honour, which he said would warrant a \"death penalty\" under sharia law. \"He is quoted as saying that my book is insulting to Muhammad and it is anything but ... in fact it honours him,\" she said, \"and for a western non-Muslim woman to do that, makes it even more important.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Metropolitan police officer who ordered the surveillance operation that ended with the death of Jean Charles de Menezes in 2005 today spoke of the \"unprecedented\" pressure on the force after the July 7 London bombings and the failed attacks a fortnight later.</p> <p>Giving evidence at the De Menezes inquest, Peter Clarke said he was away from the capital at the time the Brazilian was shot dead by anti-terror police at Stockwell tube station in south London. He said he had been supporting his wife, who had been deeply affected after their teenage son narrowly escaped the 7/7 explosions.</p> <p>Clarke, who retired this year after heading the counter-terrorism unit at Scotland Yard, was questioned about the decision to \"lock down\" potential terrorist landmarks on July 12, one day after the discovery of the terrorists' bomb factory in Leeds and their abandoned car at Luton railway station.</p> <p>The fear of further attacks was so great that Buckingham Palace, the houses of parliament and New Scotland Yard were all completely locked down at one point, Clarke said. No one was allowed to leave any of the buildings for an hour and a half on July 12.</p> <p>Richard Horwell QC, for the commissioner of the Met police, said: \"That meant that no one could enter New Scotland Yard or parliament and no one could leave.\"</p> <p>Clarke replied: \"That's absolutely right. In fact it included Buckingham Palace as well. It was completely unprecedented, as was some of the decision-making having to be made at that time about whether to warn the public about the possibility of a suicide bomber being on the loose or not.</p> <p>\"I remember those as being some of the most difficult decisions that one had ever confronted. If we warned the public, we could cause unnecessary panic. If we didn't and something terrible happened, the obvious question is: why didn't you warn the public? That is the sort of pressure we were working under day in, day out. July 12 is but one example.\"</p> <p>The former anti-terror chief said there was a \"strange atmosphere\" during the period after the two sets of attacks. </p> <p>\"Like most of my colleagues, I didn't go home very much in that period after July 7, and one could sense it in the evenings walking around or going out. There was a sense in the air that this has happened, could it happen again, is it likely to happen again?\"</p> <p>He explained that his wife had been very anxious after the first bomb attacks and suffered delayed shock. Clarke's 16-year-old son had been passing through King's Cross station in London bound for Cambridge on the morning of July 7. He arrived moments after Germaine Lindsay blew himself up on a Piccadilly Line train that had just left King's Cross. The teenager telephoned his father to say he could not get into the station and had seen smoke and people running around. </p> <p>Clarke said: \"I hadn't heard by that stage - it was just before 9am - that this was a terrorist attack but from what he was telling me, I had my suspicions about what it could be. So I gave him the instructions to get away from there as quickly as possible. And in fact we, my wife and I, then told him to get on a bus to get away.\"</p> <p>Less than an hour later, Hasib Hussain set off a bomb on a number 30 bus in Tavistock Square, near King's Cross. Clarke said he and his wife were unable to contact their son for some time after this.</p> <p>\"For me, I was in the centre of things so perhaps it wasn't so difficult. But for my wife it was extraordinarily difficult. Our holiday had been due to begin a day or two after that. I told my family to go on holiday and obviously I wouldn't be able to join them.\"</p> <p>Clarke eventually joined his family on the morning of July 21 2005, ahead of the second, failed series of attacks. He flew back to London the next day after learning of De Menezes's death.</p> <p>De Menezes, 27, was shot dead on July 22 2005 by firearms police when he was mistaken for the failed suicide bomber Hussain Osman.</p> <p>Michael Mansfield QC, for the De Menezes family, responded to Clarke's description of the strained atmosphere in London by pointing out that the capital experienced simultaneous multiple bombings during the Troubles in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>Clarke said there was the danger of \"comparing chalk and cheese\". \"That Irish terrorist campaign was of an entirely different nature to the campaign that we have been facing in this country for the past six or seven years,\" he said. \"There are some fundamental differences, which demand different responses, different structures and a different mindset to the prevention and detection of the attacks.</p> <p>\"The threat that we have seen from the Islamist groupings is global in its origins and every investigation seems to take us across the world. We have seen the use of suicide as a regular feature both here and overseas. There have been no warnings given and there has been no determination or will to restrict casualties.</p> <p>\"On the contrary, in investigation after investigation we have seen that the ambition of the terrorists is simply to kill as many people as possible.\"</p> <p>Clarke described the tactics adopted by the Met to tackle on-the-run suicide bombers after Spanish police officers were killed while trying to arrest those responsible for the 2004 Madrid bombings. Patrolling police were warned to look out for people sweating, mumbling or praying and wearing bulky clothes not suitable for the weather.</p> <p>\"Recent experience, not only with Madrid but also with the Netherlands in October 2003, shows us that the current groupings of terrorists when cornered tend to either fight back or to kill themselves and try to kill others in the process,\" Clarke told the inquest.</p> <p>A senior Scotland Yard firearms adviser, named only as Andrew, told the sixth day of the 12-week inquest that the two officers who fired the fatal shots at De Menezes were not \"gung-ho\". He said there was a \"considerable culture of constraint\" among the teams of highly trained marksmen. He had never fired at anyone in his long career as a firearms specialist.</p> <p>Ian Stern QC, representing the police who shot De Menezes, told the inquest CO19 specialist firearms officers were deployed between 600 and 1,000 times a year. Between 2001 and 2005, there were only five operations in which shots were fired, causing a total of four deaths, he said. </p> <p>The hearing continues.</p>",
  "<p>The country's biggest trade union is to stage a \"fat capitalist pig\" demo outside the Tory party conference in Birmingham on Wednesday while David Cameron makes his keynote speech.</p> <p>Unite members wearing \"pig masks\" are to protest over what they claim is the \"deafening silence\" from the Tories over what action they would take to tackle the global economic crisis.</p> <p>The row has been sparked by disclosures that a number of Tory donors have been involved in short-selling banks which have either had to be taken over or nationalised by the government.</p> <p>Joint general secretary Derek Simpson said today: \"This exposes the Tories for what they really are. They are funding their party and maybe even their election campaign on the misery of thousands of British families, who could lose their homes and jobs because of the spivs and speculators.</p> <p>\"Thousands of staff at banks like HBOS and LloydsTSB fear for their jobs but the Tories seem more interested in taking money from the culprits of the credit crunch than helping the victims.</p> <p>\"There has been a deafening silence from the Tories when almost everybody else in the country - including Labour - are calling for City excesses to be reined in. Now the country knows why. They are the same old Tories. They cannot be allowed to win the next election.\"</p> <p>The union was today contacting finance workers across the UK to gather support for the protest.</p> <p>The GMB union demanded that the Financial Services Authority, the regulator, launch an inquiry into the Tory donors who are connected to the short selling of bank shares.</p> <p>Paul Kenny, the GMB's general secretary, said: \"GMB is aware that there is a major inquiry under way in the US to establish if rules were broken during the recent meltdown in the financial sector. GMB would like the FSA to establish what meetings these donors had with Tory politicians and what they discussed at the meetings. </p> <p>\"Did these meetings influence the recent Tory defence of short trading which brought down the Bank of Scotland?\"</p>",
  "<p>With the global financial system in meltdown, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne\">George Osborne</a> faced two big problems in his speech today. The first was to be heard at all on a day when the <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/29/bradfordbingley.banking5 \">Bradford &amp; Bingley was nationalised</a>, shares were plunging and the markets were fretting about which would be the next domino to fall.</p> <p>The second was to finger <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordonbrown\">Gordon Brown</a> as the man responsible for Britain's economic woes, a more difficult task than it was a couple of weeks ago. </p> <p><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/politics/toryconference \">Conservative</a> strategists are aware of the public antagonism towards the City, and are keen to counter the idea that Labour will be more comfortable re-regulating the banks than the party traditionally associated with making life easier for big finance.</p> <p>Osborne's answer to the first problem was to come up with an eye-catching proposal to cut council tax by taking the axe to central government's burgeoning budget for consultancy and advertising. Any council that keeps its council tax increases to 2.5% of less will receive extra money from Whitehall to reduce bills by a further 2.5%.</p> <p>This, no question, is the sort of thing that goes down well in Middle England (the deal does not apply to the devolved administrations in the rest of the UK). </p> <p>It is hard for ministers to justify the colossal sums spent on management consultancy; the government spends five times as much per employee than the private sector.</p> <p>Moreover, voters hate paying council tax, which they assume is being blown by town hall pen-pushers rather than being spent on frontline services. The move towards fortnightly refuse collection has merely served to heighten this suspicion.</p> <p>Osborne assumes that councils will be able to keep their council tax increases to 2.5% through greater efficiency. This, though, may be more difficult than he thinks. The bulk of council spending goes on wages and salaries, and across the economy as a whole they are rising by around 4%. </p> <p>Add on the costs of public sector pensions and the need to provide care for an ageing population and it's not hard to see why there is upward pressure on council tax bills.</p> <p>Osborne's answer to the second problem was to treat 1997 as year zero, ignoring anything that happened in the preceding 18 years of Conservative rule. </p> <p>So, no mention of financial deregulation, no mention of Big Bang, no mention of the massive boom-bust in the housing market of the late 1980s and 1990s.</p> <p>Despite that, his attack on Labour's handling of the economy was effective. The shadow chancellor pointed out \u2013 correctly \u2013 that for the past decade or more growth has depended the three engines of finance, housing and government spending, and scant attention was paid to what would happen if those engines stalled. </p> <p>\"Now the credit has dried up. The engines of the economy have stalled. The party is over.\" </p> <p>If Labour's recovery in the opinion polls proves short-lived, it will be because the public has reached the same conclusion, and Osborne was particularly scathing about the prime minister's boast that Labour had abolished boom and bust.</p> <p>The opposition's fear, nonetheless, is that the government will benefit from the financial crisis, both because of the effective action taken to rescue banks in trouble over the past fortnight, and from an unspoken sense that the Conservatives remain the party of the hedge fund dealer and the short-seller. </p> <p>As a result, Osborne deployed some of his toughest language when he said he would not \"increase taxes on the family earning \u00a320,000 to carry on paying the bonuses of the banker earning \u00a32m pounds.\" </p> <p>It was, in truth, far more robust than Brown, Alistair Darling or any other member of the cabinet managed in Manchester last week.<br></p>",
  "<p>Almost every major auto manufacturer has now announced <a href=\"http://climateprogress.org/2008/09/22/chrysler-mazda-hyundai-and-nissan-announce-plug-ins-honda-stands-alone-against-phevs/\">plans to offer a plug-in hybrid vehicle</a> that can run on electricity for 20-40 miles before switching to gasoline. Since half of American cars travel under 25 miles a day, plug-ins allow people to do most of their driving on electricity, but still have a car for long-distance trips that can be easily and quickly refuelled with gasoline.</p> <p>The most highly anticipated of all the plug-ins is the <a href=\"http://climateprogress.org/2008/09/18/all-things-chevy-volt-including-the-house-tax-credit-for-plug-ins/\">Chevy Volt</a>, whose new design was recently rolled out by GM. It will be offered to the public by the end of 2010, and, soon after that, <a href=\"http://climateprogress.org/2007/09/01/gm-may-make-60000-plug-in-hybrids-in-2010/\">GM expects to be selling 60,000 a year</a>.</p> <p>One key advantage of electricity as an alternative fuel is that it is much, <a href=\"http://blogs.cars.com/kickingtires/2008/09/chevy-volt-pict.html\">much cheaper per mile than gasoline</a> at current prices. GM says it will cost $0.02 per mile to drive the Volt less than 40 miles per day, versus $0.12 per mile for gasoline at a price of $3.60. If gas prices continue to rise over the next decade, as many think, the fuel savings from plug-ins will only grow.</p> <p>Another advantage is that electricity can come from pollution-free sources that do not contribute to global warming. There simply is no other alternative fuel that offers a more affordable and practical path to sharply reducing the transportation sector's greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>That said, the lithium-ion batteries required for plug-ins have never been used for this application before. As one battery expert told me: \"There are only pilot production of various Li-Ion batteries\" around the world. An alternative fuel vehicle expert told me that GM has \"already sunk at least $1bn into the Volt and cannot reasonably expect a profit from a $45,000 new car in an economy which is imploding. The actual cost of the vehicle may be higher.\"</p> <p>So to succeed, plug-ins like the Volt will require several years of sustained government support. But that should not be a surprise. No country in the world has achieved significant market penetration of an alternative-fuel vehicle without major government incentives and mandates.</p> <p>Yet while Barack Obama strongly believes in such incentives and mandates, John McCain has a quarter-century record in Congress strongly opposing them. Indeed, he has voted with oil-patch senator James Inhofe and against clean energy and alternative fuels a remarkable <a href=\"http://climateprogress.org/2008/09/20/the-greenwasher-from-arizona-has-a-record-as-dirty-as-the-denier-from-oklahoma/\">42 out of 44 times since the mid-1990s</a>, not even counting the last eight consecutive votes on renewable energy incentives that he didn't bother to show up for.</p> <p>His campaign's big new idea for pushing plug-ins? He proposed <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/06/23/campaign.wrap/\">a $300m government prize</a> to whoever develops a car battery that far surpasses current batteries. But every energy and car company on the planet already knows they'll get rich by improving batteries. Indeed, the world is probably spending $1bn a year in this quest. This $300m prize is a pointless gimmick.</p> <p>Obama has committed to putting one million plug-ins on the road by 2015. He has proposed a $7,000 tax credit for the purchase of such vehicles. Finally, to help jump-start a plug-in market, Obama has committed that \"half of all cars purchased by the federal government will be plug-in hybrids or all-electric by 2012.\"</p> <p>If this country doesn't strongly embrace plug-ins, Europe may well become the leader. After all, gas prices are considerably higher in Europe, which means plug-ins will provide consumers there far larger fuel cost savings. Also, Europeans drive about half as much as Americans, so they may be able to avoid gas consumption almost entirely with a well-designed plug-in, perhaps one with a smaller all-electric range.</p> <p>Indeed, GM has made a mistake by giving the Volt a 40-mile all-electric range. The batteries are by far the most expensive thing in plug-ins. Also, the batteries add weight and take up considerable trunk space. So a smart designer will put in the fewest batteries needed to capture the most consumer benefit.</p> <p>The vast majority of people commute much less than 40 miles a day. This is true in US and even more so in other countries. In addition, as plug-ins become popular, we will very quickly see electric outlets in parking garages, malls and the like, so people will be able to charge at home and then again at work or when shopping.</p> <p>So I think a plug-in that goes closer to 20 miles all-electric before reverting to a gasoline hybrid makes much more sense, especially for initial market introduction where the cost of the vehicle still reflects the use of expensive batteries that have not come down in cost. Ultimately, economies of scale and improvements in manufacturing and technology will make the batteries and the whole electric drivetrain more affordable.</p> <p>The twin problems of global warming and limited oil resources make plug-ins inevitable. The only question is which companies and which countries become the leaders. That will be determined in part by the marketplace and in part by the US election.</p>",
  "<p>The US woke up to the demise of yet another high-street banking name today as the troubled finance group Wachovia agreed to a rescue takeover by the world's biggest bank, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/citigroup\">Citigroup</a>.</p> <p>Federal regulators helped to broker a deal in which Citigroup will absorb $42bn (\u00a323bn) of losses on a $312bn pool of loans held by Wachovia, which has a bulging portfolio of risky mortgages known as \"option ARMs\".</p> <p>Under the deal, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) will absorb any losses beyond Citigroup's agreed liability in return for $12bn of preferred stock for bearing the risk.</p> <p>The FDIC stressed that Wachovia did not fail, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/26/banking.creditcrunch1\">unlike Washington Mutual</a> which was seized by the authorities after suffering a run on deposits last week. </p> <p>But the regulator said it had helped to sell Wachovia in order \"to avoid serious adverse effects on economic conditions and financial stability\". \"This morning's decision was made under extraordinary circumstances with significant consultation among the regulators and the Treasury,\" said the FDIC's chairman, Sheila Bair. \"This action was necessary to maintain confidence in the banking industry given current financial market conditions.\"</p> <p>As of the end of June this year, Wachovia had $812bn of assets including $447bn of customers' deposits. It is a familiar name in towns and cities across the US with 3,300 banking branches and 1,500 retail stockbroking offices. The firm, which is based in Charlotte, North Carolina, employs 120,000 people.</p> <p>The US treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, backed the deal: \"I agree with the FDIC and the Federal Reserve that a failure of Wachovia would have posed a systemic risk. As a result of this transaction, all Wachovia depositors will be protected and Wachovia's senior and subordinated debt will be assumed by Citigroup.\"</p> <p>Wachovia's demise comes as Congress prepares to vote today on a $700bn emergency bail-out package intended to stem the flow of bleeding in the financial services industry.</p> <p>Wachovia's shares have little value under the deal and in pre-market trading on the New York Stock Exchange, they sank from $10 to just 97 cents. At the beginning of the year, Wachovia's stock was changing hands for $38.</p> <p>In common with Washington Mutual last week, Wachovia has been dragged into trouble by so-called \"option ARM\" mortgages which allow customers huge flexibility in setting their level of repayments. Consumers often opt to repay only the interest on their loans and in some cases, they can choose to make repayments below even the level of accruing interest.</p> <p>Donn Vickrey, co-founder of Gradient Analytics, said: \"What these loans did is attract people who were aspirational buyers and people who were speculative buyers. They were people who really couldn't afford a home under a traditional repayment mortgage.\"</p> <p>Most such mortgages \"reset\" into more expensive deals after a couple of years. But the falling US property market has made it impossible for customers to refinance at this point, leaving them unable to afford the revised repayments.</p> <p>\"They allowed marginal buyers to buy homes they really couldn't afford,\" said Vickrey. \"Everything was fine as long as house prices went up and they could continue to refinance.\"</p> <p>To help finance the deal, Citigroup said it would raise $10bn of capital by issuing new shares. The New York-based banking empire said the combination would create a network with a 9.8% share of US high-street banking and with global deposits of $1.3 trillion.</p> <p>\"The transaction is extremely attractive from a strategic perspective,\" said Citigroup's chief executive, Vikram Pandit. \"It will deliver the combined capabilities of two powerful organisations to our customers and shareholders.\" <br></p>",

  "<p>Rail groups hailed but business criticised <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/29/toryconference.conservatives4\">Conservative plans</a>, unveiled today, to scrap the third runway at Heathrow and build a \u00a320bn rail link between London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds.</p> <p>John Stewart, the chairman of Heathrow anti-expansion group Hacan, said the Tory plan was \"a bold one fitting for the 21st century\".</p> <p>He said: \"The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives\">Conservatives</a> realise that business is not clamouring for a third runway. What they desperately want is a better rather than a bigger Heathrow. This announcement today is good for business, good for the environment and good for local residents.\"</p> <p>Stephen Joseph, executive director of the Campaign for Better Transport, said: \"The Conservatives have responded to the fact that expanding Heathrow would break our chances of tackling climate change.\"</p> <p>And Richard Brown, chief executive of Channel Tunnel train company Eurostar, said: \"This is a far-sighted plan that will bring benefits to travellers, regional economies and the environment alike.\"</p> <p>But David Frost, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \"This debate shouldn't be about either high-speed rail or a third runway at Heathrow. A fully thought through transport vision would recognise that improvements to both the UK's rail and air infrastructure are essential.</p> <p>\"Business understands the need to protect the environment. But refusing to listen to the needs of the economy on the issue of Heathrow expansion will hold back British business in the future.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for airport operator BAA said: \"We believe this country needs both a third runway at Heathrow and high-speed rail. To prioritise one over the other is a false choice and will put Britain's future competitiveness at risk. It is not clear how this proposal will resolve the lack of airport capacity, a problem which must urgently be addressed.\"</p> <p>Matthew Knowles, a spokesman for the Society of British Aerospace Companies, said: \"It is disappointing that the Conservatives do not recognise the progress that the aviation industry has made in recent years to further improve its environmental performance as well as the economic importance of the global access points for the UK regions that Heathrow provides.</p> <p>\"Restricting the growth of aviation will affect the investment that aerospace companies put into developing clean technology. This proposal is therefore a counter-productive one.\"</p> <p>The transport secretary, Ruth Kelly, said: \"These proposals are politically opportunistic, economically illiterate and hugely damaging to Britain's national interests.</p> <p>\"The Tories are posing a false choice - we need both more capacity in Britain's airports and on our main rail lines.<br>\"Even if every flight from Manchester and Leeds/Bradford to Heathrow were replaced by a new high-speed line then Heathrow would still be operating at 97% capacity. </p> <p>\"It is the Tories who cannot face up to the tough decisions needed to support the economy, hiding behind unfunded, ill thought through policy announcements which only reinforces their reputation as lightweight, shallow and only interested in grabbing a headline.

  "<p><strong>Alistair Darling, the chancellor, said this about City bankers in his speech to the Labour conference in Manchester last week:</strong></p> <p>\"It's essential that bonuses don't result in people being encouraged to take on more and more risk without understanding the damage that might be done, not just to their bank, but to the rest of us in the wider economy.</p> <p>\"When I made this point at the TUC, I was accused of pandering to the unions. This is not an accusation many of you may think is often made against me.</p> <p>\"But I don't think the millions of families or businesses forced to pay more for the loans will think I was pandering. Bonuses should encourage good long-term decisions, not short-term reckless ones.</p> <p>\"But the problems we face are also global - and will require global solutions. Just as no government on its own can combat global terrorism or tackle climate change, so no government alone can put in place the right supervisory safeguards in this global economy.\" <br><strong><br>Today, this was George Osborne, the shadow chancellor's key message to the City at the Conservative conference in Birmingham:</strong></p> <p>\"I am not going to blame everything on the bankers alone. But nor am I going to excuse them of their responsibility, or allow them to think that things can carry on as before.</p> <p>\"And I want to say this to the City more generally. There have been terrible failures of regulation. And the people in charge for the last 10 years must bear their full share of responsibility.</p> <p>\"But in the end the failures of the banking industry are the failings of the bankers. Perhaps there are some market ideologues who think that the money men can do no wrong. But I tell you this right now: I am not one of them.</p> <p>\"We want the City to succeed. We recognise the importance of the investment you bring, the prosperity you have created, the thousands of jobs that depend on you.</p> <p>\"As David Cameron says, we're not going to engage in knee-jerk attacks on financial services. We know that the industry employs people not only in hedge funds in Mayfair, but bank branches in Mansfield and call centres in Manchester.</p> <p>\"We admire the drive and the enterprise of so many people in the business world. We won't let the City of London disappear to the city of Geneva or the city of Dubai or the city of Mumbai.</p> <p>\"You will get the support of a Conservative government to maintain a strong and responsible banking industry that leads the world.</p> <p>\"But I say this too.

  "<p>World central banks desperately tried to stave off collapse of the global banking system today with massive injections of cash into money markets buckling under the news of another rash of bank failures.</p> <p>Interbank lending markets across the world had been plunged at the opening into further turmoil as the weekend collapse of Bradford &amp; Bingley and Fortis meant other banks remained reluctant to lend to each other.</p> <p>Early in the day, the Bank of England made an injection of \u00a340bn of three-month funding but that was later trumped by the US Federal Reserve which, in conjunction with the BoE and other central banks, increased its reciprocal dollar fund swap arrangements to $620bn (\u00a3343.6bn), more than double the previous amount.</p> <p>\"They are throwing billions around, but things seem to be getting worse.

  "<p>In <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00dczz3\">The Funny Thing About Ramadan</a>, a documentary crew followed a \"bacon sarnie-munching, wine-swilling\" non-practising Muslim down her path to fasting and reconnection with her faith. It was told from a humorous perspective, but nevertheless managed to touch on the fact that the act of fasting means different things to different people and that although it is a physical feat, the spiritual and social aspects of Ramadan can be just as interesting.</p> <p>The sense of community that fasting engenders is one of the most treasured aspects of the fasting month for Muslims, which draws to a close <a href=\"http://www.when-is.com/eid-al-fitr-2008.asp\">tomorrow</a>. When one is in the company of other fasting Muslims, the fast becomes a fun challenge, a group marathon of self-discipline that proves the Arabic saying \"pain in company is joy\". In Muslim countries, even secular ones, working hours are adjusted, TV programmes launch special Ramadan schedules and shops open later, nudging the zero hour of the population's circadian rhythms further down daylight hours in order to minimise fasting time.</p> <p>My memories of fasting in the Arab world consist of eager anticipation, reminiscent of that which a change in the seasons brings about, as the sights, smells and sounds of Ramadan arrive. In Egypt, lanterns are lit and dot balconies for 30 days, in Sudan, a lone elderly volunteer walks the streets reminding fasters to dine before dawn and in Saudi Arabia, the sonorous prayers from hundreds of mosques drift through the evening air. The fast itself becomes just one part of the experience of the month.</p> <p>Because of this universal recognition, it would be more of an aberration for a Muslim among Muslims to ignore Ramadan than it is for one to fast in a non-Muslim environment. So much business and pleasure these days is conducted around a meal or drinks or coffee, that to participate but fast makes others uncomfortable and to shun company makes you a hermit and the fasting hours feel all the longer. A pious Muslim colleague, an accountant, revealed at the beginning of the month that he only fasts on the weekend, solemnly declaring that \"one cannot serve two masters\". </p> <p>It's true that fasting makes it more difficult to perform professionally, but in the Muslim world this is tempered by the fact that almost everybody else is either fasting as well or wouldn't dare to criticise someone for following a pillar of Islam. In London there are no such allowances, and nor should there be. In countries where fasters aren't accommodated, fasting during daylight hours can be an novel experience. The actual physical limitations are suddenly very real. Ironically, this may make the faster to be more aware of the effort he or she is making, to question it and examine the endeavour when it is a solitary one, and not made easier by being swept along on the crest of a wave of communal practice. Is it virtuous to fast but to fail your employer? Does the isolation enhance the spiritual value of the fast or merely highlight the practice as one that loses much of its meaning when taken out of context?</p> <p>Equally, you shouldn't expect non-Muslim friends and colleagues to take to the concept readily, changing their behaviour to suit your schedule. Divorced from its cultural and religious milieu, fasting can appear to be anything from a bizarre sadomasochistic ritual to something deeply anachronistic. I find that measures such as those that <a href=\"http://www.pickledpolitics.com/archives/2289\">sparked controversy</a> earlier this month are unnecessary, not only because they alienate non-Muslims but also because they demand a type of obligatory sensitivity that is only really meaningful when it's voluntary. Unlike <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/06/islam.religion\">Huma Qureishi</a>, every one I work with knows that I am fasting. Some are excruciatingly mindful of it; others are intrigued and ask questions about why I'm doing it (some that had not even occurred to me) and a minority make jokes, commenting on the lunacy of it all. There is a universal awareness, but whether it's a subtle, silently mouthed apology as someone tucks into a sandwich or a candid \"Bugger! Nesrine is nil by mouth so we can't\", it's not one that I demand nor expect.</p> <p>As stories in the public domain swing from tales of a rabid Islamophobia engulfing the country to cries of alarm at rampant political correctness, there is still a middle ground, inhabited by the majority. Do Muslims have to keep their heads down or are they imposing their practices on others in a secular country? In my experience, not keeping my head down has made my fast a little easier as gestures of sensitivity or understanding have tempered the alienation. But because I've not demanded conditions that would have made the fast more comfortable, this has probably been the most physically and spiritually challenging Ramadan I have ever experienced.</p>",
  "<p>Now here's an interesting prediction from a breakfast fringe meeting at the Tory conference today. John McCain will beat Barack Obama on November 4, but serve only one term. In consequence the next presidential contest in the United States will be fought between Vice-President Sarah Palin and Senator Hilary Clinton.</p> <p>No, I don't believe it either. Too much is now changing too fast in our world for any safe prediction \u2013 this one came from Francis Maude MP \u2013 to be made about how things will be in 2012. </p> <p>When \"Nuclear Jack\" Welch, the tough old boot who masterminded General Electric (GE) for years decides \u2013 as he did the other day \u2013 that this is the Big One, we had all better fasten our seatbelts.</p> <p>Put it another way, my old Guardian colleague, <a href=\"http://www.simonwinchester.com/\">Simon Winchester</a>, now a highly-successful, US-based author \u2013 Krakatowa, The Doctor of Crowthorne etc - likes to tell the story of how he lectured in New York on the coming perils of global warning, explaining how rising levels of the world's oceans may drown us all. </p> <p>\"Well, not New York of course,\" someone in the audience observed. Yes, New York too. Not quite the flood Winchester predicted, but it may now be happening.</p> <p>Back to Birmingham, the presidency and the Tory conference. There's a building they've dubbed \"the freedom zone\" behind the main conference hall. It's where the libertarian right is parading its views, possibly unaware that our fast-changing world is making many such views a bit of a luxury.</p> <p>This morning a group called the \"DC Tories\" \u2013 ie Brits who live in Washington \u2013 got a couple of senior American backroom types to debate the relative merits of Senators McCain and Obama, with Ed Cox (Richard Nixon's son-in-law) for the Republicans, and Bill Barnard (an ex-professor at Oxford) for the Democrats.</p> <p>In truth, both were rather safe and dull. The two Tory MPs who had attended the two conventions, Brooks Newmark for McCain and Francis Maude at what he admitted was the \"brilliant\" Obama launch in Denver, were both much livelier. US politics tends to the earnest these days: it has done them little good lately.</p> <p>Anyway Cox argued that on the key issues - freedom, opportunity, accountability, limited government and a strong defence \u2013 his man has a long and solid track record while Obama does not. </p> <p>The world is a far more dangerous place than it was in the early 90s, he added. Putin, not Yeltsin, Hizbullah and Hamas, not the Oslo Accords, a near-nuclear Iran, Danny Ortega back in power in Nicaragua, another ally for that Hugo Ch\u00e1vez.</p> <p>Oh yes, and China on the rise. Not yet a world power, but an economic power in east Asia (they still don't get it, these guys do they?), it is in a position to tail the US Seventh Fleet, which protects Taiwan. If the Chinese CP senses its power ebbing it will play the nationalist card against Taiwan, he said.</p> <p>Good point, though he didn't say what he thinks the US will be able to do about it. </p> <p>McCain understands this stuff and made a brave stand in favour of the US military \"surge\" which has stablised Iraq \u2013 even George Bush was initially against it. He didn't mention him by name, Bush's name barely featured at all.</p> <p>Bill Barnard should have made short work of all that, but he was a bit flat. He agreed about priorities, but said the Democrats had a better record on all of them. Didn't mention Obama too much either, now I reflect on it. </p> <p>McCain's record deserved respect, but wasn't any where near as good as claimed. He seems obsessed with process, not with substance. On the two issues where he's broken with his party on substance \u2013 the amnesty for illegal immigrants and carbon emissions \u2013 he has been forced to backtrack.</p> <p>Since Cox had made much of McCain's judgment, Barnard retaliated by saying that a man of 72 with skin cancer problems who picked Sarah Palin as his running mate when he barely knew her was not a man whose judgment voters should trust.</p> <p>Alaska looks big, but it has just 700,000 citizens \u2013 \"less than Birmingham\", he pointed out. As for Obama's tax-and-spend instincts, his tax cut for 95% of taxpayers could be funded simply by reversing the Bush tax cuts for the very rich \u2013 so great had those cuts been.</p> <p>As I suggested earlier, those sort of exchanges are way out of whack with reality as it is emerging on Wall St, Main St and New St Birmingham, which has five building society offices in a row. Brooks Newmark, MP for Braintree and himself a City figure, weighed in behind McCain and said: \"I love Sarah Palin.\" </p> <p>Why? Because she is a change candidate, a small town mayor who took on her party's establishment and became governor. All right, she's a Christian fundamentalist who kept her own Down's baby and made her pregnant 17-year-old daughter marry the boy and keep their baby. Easy to mock in Europe, but up to 150 million Americans think the same way. That is true \u2013 at least in theory \u2013 and it is a sobering thought.</p> <p>Francis Maude called Obama \"a formidable performance artist\" whose Denver acceptance speech he would long remember. Studiously neutral as to his own preference (many Tories favour Obama) he agreed that the next president should engage better with the world - and that either will do that. Unusually, both are change candidates, both outsiders.</p> <p>Two interesting details I'd not heard before. </p> <p>One: Barnard said that McCain wanted Senator Joe Lieberman, the ex-Dem independent from Connecticut who ran with Al Gore in 2000, to be his running-mate. But he was warned it would split the convention and provoke walk-outs. So he took Palin after a brief meeting.</p> <p>Two: Cox said that George Bush had a very optimistic view of the prospects for democracy in 2001 \u2013 \" very Rousseau-ian,\" he said, not a label you hear much. So did Condi Rice. After her experience with Yeltsin's Russia they both thought that, if you got rid of the bad guys, democracy would take root easily. </p> <p>\"You Brits, with your experience of the world, know better.\" The audience liked that, of course. Did anyone land a killer blow? No, but they agreed it is a remarkable election.</p>",

It can therefore calculate the amount of carbon dioxide that a journey has emitted into the atmosphere \u2013 without any need for input from the traveller.</p> <p>The system's inventor, Andreas Zachariah, a graduate student of the Royal College of Art in London and chief executive of the Carbon Hero company, said that Carbon Diem is the world's first automated carbon calculator. </p> <p>Because it keeps a constantly updated diary of a person's carbon emissions, Zachariah said that a user can easily track their environmental impact and, if they choose, modify their behaviour to lower-carbon alternatives. </p> <p>\"We're facilitating people to make little changes and allow those changes to be noted and registered and possibly shared,\" he said. \"If lots of people realise we're in this marathon [in tackling climate change] and we're not running alone, then we actually think people will be motivated to stick to changes.\"</p> <p>He has tested the software in Nokia and Blackberry phones, using computer algorithms to predict the kind of transport a person is taking. He claims that in tests over the past year, the software was almost 100% accurate in working out when people were on airplanes or trains; it was between 65-75% accurate at guessing when people travelled on buses.</p> <p>Zachariah said he had the idea for Carbon Diem when he tried to work out his own carbon footprint using the many online calculators available. These usually involve manually entering the details of type of transport and the length of a journey. </p> <p>\"The whole process is so painful,\" Zachariah said. \"That's when I realised it had to be effortless.\"</p> <p>Zachariah believes companies could also benefit from the software, as firms committing to reducing their environmental impact may need to collect travel data on their employees. He accepts there could be concerns over privacy but says the software can be used to record only the carbon impact, not the actual routes.</p> <p>Friends of the Earth's climate campaigner, Robin Webster, said: \"Individuals have an important role to play in tackling climate change - and technologies like the Carbon Diem could help people cut their carbon footprint.\"</p> <p>The European Space Agency (Esa) gave the Carbon Diem software a regional award last year in its European satellite navigation competition. It will launch commercially in spring next year.</p>",
  "<p>The value of new <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/mortgages\">mortgage</a> lending plummeted in August, figures showed today, as falling confidence in the housing market and the squeeze on credit continued to take their toll.</p> <p>The Bank of England said net mortgage lending - the value of loans advanced during the month once repayments and redemptions are taken into account - plummeted to just \u00a3143m during the month.</p> <p>This is less than 5% of the \u00a33bn of net lending in July and the lowest level since records began in April 1993.</p> <p>The figure reflects several months of falling approvals for loans for house purchases and remortgages, with recent months showing a steady decline in the number of new deals agreed.</p> <p>There are no signs of lending levels recovering, with the figures showing the number of mortgages approved for house purchases falling to a record low in August.</p> <p>The Bank said 32,000 mortgages for purchases had been approved over the month, down from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/sep/01/mortgages.property\">July's record low of 33,000</a> and well below the previous six-month average of 49,000.</p> <p>These approvals were worth a total of \u00a34.1bn, down from \u00a34.3bn in July and below the \u00a36.8bn averaged in the previous six months.</p> <p>Remortgage numbers also fell, with 64,000 loans worth \u00a38.7bn approved during the month, compared with an average of 88,000 in the previous six months.</p> <p>The value of all types of mortgage approved in August was only \u00a313.6bn, less than half of the figure for August last year of \u00a330.2bn and the lowest for nearly seven years.</p> <p>August's figures for home purchase approvals are likely to have been hit by speculation over changes to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/stampduty\">stamp duty</a> rules, which were only confirmed at the start of this month.</p> <p>During the summer, estate agents and surveyors said they believed buyers were delaying entering the market until the government confirmed if there would be any changes to the rules.</p> <p>Howard Archer, chief UK economist at Global Insight, said: \"The dire Bank of England mortgage data show that housing market activity is being decimated by the highly damaging combination of stretched buyer affordability and tight lending practices. </p> <p>\"Widespread expectations that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/houseprices\">house prices</a> will continue to fall markedly for some considerable time to come is also significantly limiting housing market activity, as is heightened concern over the economic outlook and job prospects.\"</p> <p>The recent turmoil in the financial market, which resulted in the takeover of Halifax's owner HBOS and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/29/bradfordbingley.banking5\">today's nationalisation of Bradford &amp; Bingley</a> has pushed up mortgage rates in recent days, making life even harder for buyers.</p> <p>Last week, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/sep/26/mortgages.banking\">HSBC</a> and Woolwich increased rates on some of their deals, and today Lloyds TSB announced it was raising rates on two- and three-year fixed-rate mortgages by up to 0.26%.</p> <p>Separate figures from the Building Societies Association showed the value of mortgages approved by its lenders fell by 31% in the 12 months to August to \u00a32.8bn.</p> <p>For the third month running net lending by societies was in negative figures, at -\u00a338m.

  "<h2>Hitchcock goes to Hollywood</h2> <p>Hitchcock's arrival in the USA, in early 1939, gave him access to greater resources and to a global cinema audience. In the 1950s, Hitchcock was greatly admired by the young French film-makers of the Nouvelle Vague who recognised and promoted his work as that of a cinematic auteur and as a master of studio technique.</p> <p>The highpoint of Hitchcock's career is generally agreed to be the sequence of films beginning with Rear Window (1954) and continuing with Vertigo (1958), North by Northwest (1959), Psycho (1960) and The Birds (1963).</p> <h2>Hitchcock and voyeurism</h2> <p>Three of these films: Rear Window, Vertigo and Psycho, constitute a trilogy that explores the theme of voyeurism. This was especially significant in the later 1950s, as it introduced a psychological concept that had been explained to a popular audience, in part at least, by Freud.</p> <p>The voyeuristic observer, hidden or otherwise, and with the obsessive personality associated with sexual dysfunction, became a staple, not just for Hitchcock, but for the whole of cinema. The cinematic experience became understood as psychologically contiguous to voyeurism. Hitchcock even developed a special zoom effect used in the film to suggest the sensation of vertigo.</p> <p>The voyeuristic eroticism associated with Hitchcock's exploration of psychological suspense was heightened by the director's use of cool and elegant blondes. In Vertigo, Kim Novak leads.</p> <h2>Saul Bass</h2> <p>The poster for Vertigo is by Saul Bass, who was a pioneer of film-title sequences and of film poster design. Bass conceived the title sequence as an integral part of the film and as something that could, through the use of music, typography and moving image, establish the mood and emotional register of a film.</p> <p>Before Bass, which is to say, before about 1955, film titles were presented as a throw-back to the silent era. Titles and credits were shown as a sequence of static cards with the acting and production credits drawn onto them.</p> <p>The big colour productions of the 1950s greatly extended the production credits. Incorporating this extra information into the title sequence made it too long. Accordingly, the credits began to be organised so that title and big names were placed at the front of the film and production and general credits at the end. So, part of what Bass was doing was a pragmatic choice to organise this information clearly.</p> <p>Bass famously worked with Otto Preminger and with Alfred Hitchcock. He designed the posters and title sequences for Vertigo, North by Northwest and Psycho. Martin Scorsese persuaded him to create the title sequence for Casino (1995).</p> <h2>Vertigo</h2> <p>The poster for Vertigo combines several elements that we've discussed previously. The design is based on a simplified two-colour process that uses hand-cut lettering against a bright orange background. The tiny portraits of James Stewart and Kim Novak are the only photo-mechanical elements in the design.</p> <p>The technical specification for the poster reads as a screenprint. The small photographic elements, hand-cut type and solid bright orange are all indicators of this process. Accordingly, the film is positioned as an edgy and psychologically complex story, slightly outside the Hollywood mainstream.</p> <h2>Hand-drawn lettering and hypotrochoid curves</h2> <p>The tradition of hand-drawn lettering goes back to the German expressionist films of the 1920s. These films were pioneers of the horror genre and created a film world of oblique angles and vertiginous perspectives. The hand-drawn lettering for these films rejected the curves and serifs of traditional typefaces for something altogether more edgy and visceral.</p> <p>The main visual element in the Bass poster is a geometric pattern based on hypotrochoid curves. These curves are familiar from the popular Spirograph toys of the 1970s. The curves provide a complex manipulation of the normal grid-spaces of our concrete and psychological environments.</p>",
  "<p>Today, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, announced that by order under the Banking (Special Provisions) Act 2008, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bradfordbingley\">Bradford &amp; Bingley's</a> UK and Isle of Man retail deposit business along with its branch network has been transferred to Abbey National plc. This transfer follows a competitive auction process for this part of the business, conducted by Morgan Stanley on behalf of HM Treasury. The remainder of Bradford &amp; Bingley's business will be taken into public ownership.</p> <p>This action by the Tripartite Authorities, protects savers' money by transferring their money to Abbey. Bradford &amp; Bingley's branches, call centres and internet operations will be open for business as usual to provide continuity of service to customers. </p> <p>Following recent turbulence in global financial markets, Bradford &amp; Bingley has found itself under increasing pressure as investors and lenders lost confidence in its ability to carry on as an independent institution. The FSA determined on Saturday morning that the firm no longer met its threshold conditions for operating as a deposit taker under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and FSA rules. </p> <p>The Government, on the advice of the FSA and the Bank of England, acted immediately to maintain financial stability and protect depositors, while minimising the exposure to taxpayers. It has worked over the weekend to bring about the part public, part private solution which best meets those objectives. </p> <p>For savers and borrowers of Bradford &amp; Bingley it will be business as usual. Customers should continue to use their normal branches to access their accounts. The transfer of the retail deposit book has been backed by cash from HM Treasury and the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. Further details about these arrangements are set out below. </p> <p>Branches will be open this morning as usual, and internet, call centre, and all other transaction services will operate as normal. Although some of those employees are now employed under Abbey, they should all attend their workplace in the normal way. Savers' money remains absolutely safe and secure. Borrowers should continue to make their payments in the normal way. </p> <p>The remaining assets and liabilities of Bradford &amp; Bingley - principally comprising its mortgage book, personal loan book, headquarters and relevant staff, and treasury assets and its wholesale liabilities - will be taken into public ownership through the transfer to the Treasury of the company's shares. HM Treasury and the Financial Services Compensation Scheme will recover payments in the wind-down of the remainder of Bradford &amp; Bingley. To provide assurance to wholesale depositors and borrowers, and to preserve financial stability in this case and maximise proceeds in the wind-down, the Government has put in place guarantee arrangements for six months to safeguard certain wholesale borrowings and deposits with Bradford &amp; Bingley. It is the Government's current intention to seek state aid approval from the European Commission to extend these guarantee arrangements as part of the restructuring of Bradford &amp; Bingley. </p> <p>The FSCS has been triggered following the failure of Bradford &amp; Bingley to meet its regulatory requirements, prior to the making of the Transfer Order. </p> <p>Under the Transfer Order, the FSCS has paid out approximately \u00a314bn to enable retail deposits held in Bradford &amp; Bingley and covered by the FSCS to be transferred to Abbey. The Treasury has made a payment to Abbey for retail deposit amounts not covered by the FSCS, amounting to approximately \u00a34bn, to be transferred to Abbey. In return, the FSCS and the Treasury have acquired rights in respects of the proceeds of the wind-down and realisation of the assets of the remaining business of Bradford &amp; Bingley in public ownership. </p> <p>The FSCS has financed its payout through a short-term loan from the Bank of England, which will be replaced with a loan from the Government after a short period of time. The repayment terms of the loan for the first three years provide for repayment of interest at a rate of one-year LIBOR plus 30 basis points, plus the repayment of any recoverables accruing to the FSCS from the wind-down of the business against the principal outstanding. The first payment, for interest from the period from now until end-March 2009, will take place at end-September 2009 and subsequent payments will be made annually thereafter. It is currently estimated that the first payment required in September 2009 by the FSCS under the loan will be approximately \u00a3450 million. After the first three years, it is intended that the loan will be refinanced by the Treasury, repayments of the principal to be made over a period of years in the light of prevailing market conditions. </p> <p>The Chancellor of the Exchequer today confirms that the Government stands behind the FSCS, so it can be relied on to be able to play its role in meeting future claims that arise. </p> <p>In the initial period of public ownership the senior management team of Bradford &amp; Bingley will remain in place to manage the transition. The Chief Executive will continue to be Richard Pym. Over time the Government will look at the management of the residual assets to ensure that this is being done in the most efficient manner. </p> <p>In the Transfer Order, the Government has varied the terms of Bradford &amp; Bingley's dated subordinated debt in order to allow for the wind-down. The Transfer Order also, among other things, extinguishes existing share options and provides for rights and obligations of lenders, bond holders, swap counterparties, suppliers and other counterparties which would otherwise be triggered by the transfer not to be triggered.</p> <p>The Treasury with the other Tripartite Authorities, acting in their respective capacities, sought a range of private sector solutions before taking this action. However, with its financial advisor, HM Treasury concluded that this option best delivered its objectives of maintaining financial stability, protecting consumers and protecting taxpayers.</p> <p>The listing of Bradford &amp; Bingley's shares has been cancelled. </p> <p>The Banking (Special Provisions) Act 2008 also provides for a compensation Order to be made. This order - relating to compensation for shareholders and others whose rights may have been affected by the transfer into public ownership - will be laid in due course. </p> <p>In due course the Government will set out further information on the operational management of the residual part of Bradford &amp; Bingley which has been taken into public ownership.</p>",
