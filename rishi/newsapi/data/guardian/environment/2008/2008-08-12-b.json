  "<p><br>Tim with his copy of Katharine Whitehorn's Kitchen in the Corner. Photograph: Graeme Robertson</p> <p>Like many lovers of food and words I'm left rather high and dry by the supposed bounty in bookshops today. Sure there are plenty of cookbooks on the bestsellers list but they all seem to come with a glittery-toothed sleb on the front cover and bear more resemblance to a 60,000 word, lavishly illustrated press release than anything I'd want to curl up in an armchair with. Fortunately, when almost everything in the bookshop looks like some sort of tie-in, exploitation or spin-off, reprints of older works stand out like beacons in the darkness.</p> <p>I've always had a <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/food/2008/07/too_many_cooks_recipe_for_love.html\">bit of a thing for old cookbooks</a> so when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/13/food.recipe\">G2</a> asked me to do a piece on reprinted cookery titles I was in my element.<a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/food/2008/07/katharine_whitehorn.html\"> Katharine Whitehorn's 'Cooking in a Bedsitter' (WoM passim)</a> got a big mention in the story as did the many titles rediscovered by both <a href=\"http://www.grubstreet.co.uk/\">Grub Street Publishing</a> and <a href=\"http://www.persephonebooks.co.uk/\">Persephone Books</a> - imprints with a special interest in old cookbooks - but we particularly wanted to sniff out some titles that might be relevant today but are currently out of print.</p> <p>In cases like this Satan's Interweb really comes into its own. It's at its best when connecting widely distributed individuals with a shared special interest. There's an ever growing constituency of food bloggers and dozens of food boards, public and private, so it was the work of a moment to hook up a small group of like-minded bookies to scour their shelves. Previous generations might have been restricted to what they had room for in their bookcases but the web and more particularly sites like <a href=\"http://www.librarything.com\">librarything</a> enable bibliophiles to virtually bolt their shelves together into one giant library.</p> <p>After a bit of ferreting we suggested some neglected titles ripe for relaunch but in doing so we realised that there were probably a lot more out there.</p> <p>So what did you think of our choices and do you have a favourite cookbook that you'd like to see back in print?</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong><em>In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/foodmonthly\">Observer Food Monthly</a> this Sunday Katharine Whitehorn talks to Rachel Cooke about gas rings, women's rights, and how to bake a kipper in a jug</em></p>",
  "<p><em>I'd be interested to know your opinions on how ethical you think certain fabrics are - bamboo, for example. With many ethical designers using these materials, are we all being taken in by the materials just because they are different, or are they really greener?</em><br><strong>Ian</strong></p> <p>Bamboo is frequently proclaimed as the world's most renewable material: it's naturally pest-resistant, grows incredibly fast and can actually help rebuild eroded soil. It takes just three or four years to go from seed to harvest and because the root network is so big, you don't even need to replant - it just shoots right back up again. Bamboo, therefore, can be grown without any chemical fertilisers or pesticides. Alas, this doesn't mean it always is. </p> <p>China is still the only country that grows bamboo on a commercial scale, and as it becomes an increasingly lucrative cash crop, farmers are starting to grow it as a mono-crop. That in itself reduces biodiversity and can lead to an increase in pests. This in turn means pesticide use becomes necessary. </p> <p>There's also some evidence that farmers are using chemical fertilisers to increase their yields. There's no reason why they shouldn't: there are no set standards or environmental guidelines in China for the growing of bamboo and clearly their concern is to get as large a crop as possible for their money. Unfortunately, though, this has an environmental cost. </p> <p>Farmers are also now beginning to clear natural forestland in order to grow more bamboo. It seems rather ironic that much of the blame for endangering the giant pandas of China can be traced to farmers and landowners clearing bamboo forest for farmland - now they're clearing it to grow back some bamboo. Too late, alas, for many pandas.</p> <p>This isn't to say that companies using bamboo fibres aren't aware of these issues. They are no doubt doing their very best to avoid them by seeking guarantees that the bamboo used is grown entirely naturally. But the Chinese production system is hardly known for its transparency and it must be difficult to get any cast-iron guarantees.</p> <p>Despite the potential drawbacks of bamboo as a crop, there's no doubt that up to this point in the supply chain, it's a great deal more sustainable than cotton or many other commercially available alternative fabrics. Where it all gets a bit tricky is in the production of the fabric itself. The excellent <a href=\"http://organicclothing.blogs.com\">Organic Clothing blog</a> has been running a series examining sustainable fabrics. It has recently looked at <a href=\"http://organicclothing.blogs.com/my_weblog/2008/08/bamboo-sprouting-green-myths.html\">bamboo production</a> and some of the claims made on behalf of the material (as opposed to the crop), in particular the oft-repeated claim that bamboo is \"naturally antibacterial\" - it's well worth a read. There have even been claims that bamboo is a \"uniquely anti-UV\" material. This is a patently absurd claim: any tightly woven dense cloth will protect your skin against UV light - for that matter, so would wrapping yourself in cardboard.</p> <p>Many of the companies using bamboo fibres say they are producing bamboo organically, using processing that does not involve harmful bleaches. There doesn't seem to be an awful lot of proof, though. The Soil Assocation doesn't currently give certification to any bamboo clothing. A spokeswoman, Sarah Compson, explained: \"The production of bamboo would fall under our perennial crop standards so in theory we could certify the crop - but the problem is the processing. The process needed to break down the bamboo to make the fibres is very similar to that used to make viscose and we've yet to see a method that would come anywhere close to complying with our production standards. People always say bamboo is great because it grows so quickly - but so does cotton.\"</p> <p>There are actually two methods of extracting fabric from the bamboo plant. The first is mechanical. This involves crushing the plants into a mush, using natural enzymes to break it down and then combing out the fibres and spinning them into a yarn. The fabric produced this way resembles linen (indeed, it is often called bamboo linen). This method does have some environmental drawbacks but could potentially be sustainable. However, because it is labour-intensive, it's expensive, and the fabric produced is not soft enough to be used in the bamboo fibre underwear that is increasingly popular.</p> <p>The second method is chemical. The plants are cooked in a cocktail of chemical solvents - primarily sodium hydroxide (lye, or caustic soda, as it's more commonly known) and carbon disulfide. Both are known to be harmful to human health, and sodium hydroxide can harm aquatic life when released into the water supply. Many companies using bamboo fabrics claim that because these are only used in a small part of the production process, they are not significant. But a factory producing tonnes of fabric a year will expose both workers and the wider environment to a vast amount of such chemicals.</p> <p>The lesson, therefore, is that until the production process becomes both more transparent and more sustainable, it might be best to keep a watchful eye on bamboo. As Sarah Compson says: \"We'd be happy to certify bamboo at the Soil Association if someone could come up with a sustainable method that goes all through the supply chain, not just the growing.\"</p> <p><em>Are you searching for ethical jeans?

  "<p>Oxfam, one of the UK's largest fundraising charities, is running an organisation-wide review, which includes possible job cuts, to try to slash 10%-15% from its total costs.</p> <p>The move reflects the development charity's prediction that donations from the public will be less than budgeted for over the next three financial years as UK households feel the bite of a faltering economy and the credit crunch.</p> <p>Oxfam says the cost cuts could mean redundancies and the closure of \"lower-priority projects\". The charity refused to name specific programmes that could face the axe, saying these would be determined by the outcome of a two-month cost-cutting review expected to be rolled out across the organisation this month, with changes being implemented in April next year.</p> <p>\"Where possible, staff reductions will be achieved through not filling vacant posts, rather than redundancies,\" says Jane Cotton, Oxfam's HR director. \"Managers are working with their teams to identify how they could best achieve the savings with as little impact on overall effectiveness as possible.\"</p> <p>The charity is facing a drop in donations at a time when it expects to ramp up its work in the developing world, where millions are bearing the brunt of the global rise in food and fuel prices.</p> <p>\"We are determined that these changes happen as part of our normal business cycle, so we are prepared for an economic downturn and have time to plan how to deal with it,\" says Cotton. \"While short-term savings will be considered, we are mainly concentrating our efforts on 2009-10 and beyond.\"</p>",
  "<p>An ice-cream van is an odd platform for a political diatribe, and Mr Softee is an unlikely name for former union hardman Sean Farrell to travel under. But needs must. He was in his late 20s in 1993 when Littleton Colliery closed down, putting him and more than 600 colleagues out of work. It was the last deep mine in the Cannock area of Staffordshire, and Farrell had to earn a living somehow. Getting a job in a local factory was not easy after being branded as \"Young Scargill\" during the miners' strike of the mid-1980s.</p> <p>On a hot summer's day, selling cornets outside a garden centre must seem infinitely preferable to \"crawling around coal faces\", as Farrell puts it. His gleaming white overall is almost confirmation of the point - a telling contrast with the state of his clothes when he emerged from working underground. \"But I don't regret having been down the pit,\" he says, forcibly. \"You couldn't put a price on the time we spent together fighting against the forces of individualism and greed.\" </p> <p>Farrell, now 44, is one of the former miners featured in Littleton, an exhibition of photographs and extensive interviews that opens at Wolverhampton's Light House media centre on Friday and moves to the National Coal Mining Museum, near Wakefield, West Yorkshire, in the new year. Watching him serve an Asian family with warmth and courtesy, it comes as a surprise to hear that he briefly became a football hooligan after the strike, when his bitterness against the police was still burning. \"They'd already criminalised thousands of us,\" he claims, \"as the instruments of a political decision to get rid of the NUM [National Union of Mineworkers]\".</p> <p><strong>Political education</strong></p> <p>He was an unusual member of Wolverhampton Wanderers' Yam-Yam Army, insofar as he carried the Guardian to away matches and travelled first class on the train if he could get away with it. On one trip to London, he found himself sitting opposite Norman Fowler, still a Conservative cabinet member at the time. Before they had reached Euston, three businessmen had given Farrell a points decision over Fowler in the resulting lively discussion, and three Yam-Yam \"soldiers\" who had wandered through from standard class, had been reduced to slack-jawed astonishment. \"They didn't know that the union had given me a good political and economic education on day-release at Keele University,\" Young Scargill recalls.</p> <p>He pauses to receive a framed photo of himself from the man behind the Littleton exhibition, photographer Luke Unsworth, who he rewards with a double 99 smothered in raspberry sauce. </p> <p>Unsworth, 37, the son of a local GP, lived in Cannock until he was 10. It was very much a mining area at the time, but the local pits all closed down in the 12 years after he left, making more than 2,000 men unemployed. \"I remember hearing about the Littleton closure when I was away at college,\" Unsworth says. \"So I came back and took some pictures on the last day.\"</p> <p>They look particularly evocative for being in black and white. Most evocative of all, perhaps, are shots of the detritus of working lives brought summarily to an end. A small pile of working clothes, including pit boots and a helmet, lies abandoned on the locker-room floor. \"Turn shower off after use,\" says a sign on soot-streaked tiles.</p> <p>\"Within two months the whole place had been flattened,\" says Unsworth, who went back recently, with Arts Council funding, to find out what happened to those men and to photograph some of them in colour. Three are running successful businesses, but most have jobs that pay lower wages than they earned at the pit. Some are retired through age, others through incapacity brought about by the pressures of digging for coal in difficult conditions.</p> <p>Chris Lilburn, 47, hasn't worked much since 1989, when, still a young man, he had to leave the pit because of a severe spinal condition. He lives close to his former place of employment, in a council house that he shares with his wife Sheena, who is a barmaid at the Littleton Arms, two of his four children, a Bedlington whippet, and two Harris hawks. </p> <p>Scanning the skies for birds was always a traditional weekend pastime for men whose working horizons were cramped and dark. But these brooding raptors are rather more exotic than the average racing pigeon. They look as though they would be more at home perched on a cactus on the Texas-Mexico border than in a small back garden in Staffordshire. Lilburn feeds them a couple of dead chicks, which look horribly like gassed pit canaries, and says: \"I fly hawks as a hobby to keep my mind occupied. My dad kept pigeons. He came down here from Blyth in Northumberland, back in the 60s. Other lads came from Scotland when their pits were worked out.\" He points to a nearby former National Coal Board estate where the roads have Scottish names.</p> <p>These were economic migrants who had \"got on their bikes\" to look for work. But in the end, they and their sons ran out of cycle track. Miners in the Midlands were better placed than most to find alternative employment when the pits closed. Indeed, some former Littleton employees found jobs in the drop forging factories of the Black Country until they, too, started to close down. </p> <p>On the way back from Lilburn's house, we pass the site of the old pit, now a new estate called Littleton Green, made up of starter homes on roads with names such as Colliers Way. Further on, Unsworth struggles to locate the former miners' club because the building is obscured by an Asda hypermarket. \"Doing this 15 years after the closure,\" he muses, \"means that enough time has elapsed to get some perspective.\"</p> <p><strong>Buggering up the planet</strong></p> <p>One example comes on the DVD that goes with the exhibition, which has Farrell reflecting on the role of fossil fuels in \"buggering up the planet\". When I put this to him at the ice-cream van, he says: \"There has never been the political will to back the technology that could make coal clean. </p> <p>\"Remember, too, that we don't really know yet what the legacy of nuclear power will be,\" he adds, before ripping off a piece of kitchen roll and wiping down the counter for the umpteenth time with antibacterial cleaner.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Littleton is at the <a href=\"http://www.light-house.co.uk/\">Light House</a>, Wolverhampton, from August 15 to September 19, and at the <a href=\"http://www.ncm.org.uk/\">National Coal Mining Museum</a>, Wakefield, West Yorkshire, from January 26 to April 26 2009.</p>",
  "<p>The Bank of England's interest rates dilemma intensified yesterday after the latest Government figures showed that sharp rises in the cost of food and fuel pushed the annual inflation rate to a 16-year-high of 4.4% last month and left it on course to hit 5% in autumn.</p> <p>Despite signs that the credit crunch has led to a slowing in the economy, data from the Office for National Statistics showed a 0.6 point jump in the annual cost of living in July - the biggest one-month jump since Labour came to power more than a decade ago.</p> <p>The ONS said food and fuel prices were rising at their fastest pace since the early 1980s. A 20% increase in the price of milk, a 40% increase in the cost of eggs and a 41% increase in the price of a sliced white loaf contributed to the rising cost of the weekly shop, up by almost 14% over the past year. Food accounted for half the July jump in inflation, with dearer meat the most important factor.</p> <p>Over the past six months inflation as measured by the government's consumer prices index has doubled and, after rising from 3.8% in June, now stands at more than twice its 2% target. Other measures of the cost of living also rose last month, with the retail prices index measure of inflation - the benchmark for many pay deals - up from 4.6% to 5%.</p> <p>Mervyn King, the Bank's governor, had to write a letter to Alistair Darling in June explaining why inflation was more than a percentage point above its target and will have to write again next month. The Bank has said global trends beyond the control of its nine-strong monetary policy committee have been responsible for the rise in inflation and has left the cost of borrowing at 5% since April after three quarter-point cuts in the preceding five months.</p> <p>The City - taken aback by the size of July's increase - said the Bank's monetary policy committee now had to decide whether to adopt a no-risks approach by raising the cost of borrowing or hope that a slowing economy and lower commodity prices would bring the cost of living back towards its target during 2009.</p> <p>Michael Saunders, economist at Citi, said today's Inflation Report - the Bank's quarterly health check on the economy - was likely to make \"grim reading\", with Threadneedle Street arguing that a pronounced slowdown in growth was needed to bring inflation back under control. \"There is little chance the MPC will cut rates in the next few months and, indeed, there remains a near-term risk that the MPC will hike rates if inflation expectations surge higher again.\"</p> <p>Some City analysts have taken comfort in recent months that so-called core inflation - a measure of the cost of living that strips out energy, food, alcohol and tobacco - had remained weak, suggesting that higher costs of fuel and food were not feeding through into price increases across the whole economy. </p> <p>Last month, however, core inflation rose from 1.6% to 1.9%. </p> <p>Vicky Redwood, of Capital Economics, said: \"The rise in core inflation will clearly leave the MPC concerned that even the sharp slowdown in activity now under way will not be severe enough to prevent a more broad-based pick-up in inflation. While we still think that the MPC could cut interest rates before the end of the year, a cut within the next couple of months looks well off the agenda. Indeed a rate rise is still a possibility.\"</p> <p>The inflation figures prompted criticism of the government from opposition parties. The Conservative leader, David Cameron, said: \"The most important concern up and down the country is the deteriorating state of our economy. Hundreds of thousands of families now have the threat of negative equity hanging over them, businesses are cutting back, unemployment is creeping up and this morning's inflation figures are yet another worrying signal for families desperately trying to make ends meet.\" </p> <p>Vince Cable, Treasury spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, said: \"It's very clear that we're in for a dose of stagflation, with the economy slowing abruptly and inflation too high and increasing.\" </p> <p>The Treasury chief secretary, Yvette Cooper, said the government was cutting taxes by \u00a34bn to mitigate the effects of the global downturn but said there was a limit to what the government could do in the face of rising commodity prices. \"I think everybody recognises that it is not possible for governments to fully insulate, whether it is households or businesses, from these kinds of world oil prices that we have seen.\"</p> <p>ONS figures showed that other countries have also been affected by rising inflation, with the average for the countries of the eurozone more than doubling from 1.8% to 4.1% between July 2007 and July 2008.</p>",
  "<p>About 115 million animals were used in scientific research globally in 2005, according to an estimate based on official national figures and extrapolations from the number of scientific papers that were published involving animals. </p> <p>The vast majority of the animals used were rodents (83.5%) with primates, cats and dogs making up 0.15%, 0.06% and 0.24% of the total respectively.</p> <p>The 115 million figure was difficult to compile because recording criteria differed greatly from country to country. Only 37 countries had even partial national figures, while the researchers estimated the numbers for a further 142 countries based on the number of publications involving animals that came out in 2006. </p> <p>The global estimate was put together jointly by the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection and the Dr Hadwen Trust for Humane Research and is published in the journal Alternatives to Laboratory Animals. \"It is shocking that so few countries consider it important even to count the number of animals suffering in their laboratories,\" said the groups. </p> <p>\"It is impossible to have a clear and honest debate about the role of animal experiments in the 21st century when the official number of animals involved is outrageously underestimated.\"</p> <p>The final figure is also inflated by animals that would not be included in the UK figures - for example surplus animals produced during breeding which are not used in research and animals that are humanely killed so that their organs or blood can be used for research purposes.</p> <p>In Britain, researchers must record the number of animals they use, the number of procedures they carry out and the number of breeding animals used in GM breeding. But in the US, the largest user of research animals - more than 17 million according to the researchers' estimate - official figures do not include mice, rats, birds, fish, reptiles and amphibians. </p> <p>Most countries record no figures at all and Liechtenstein and San Marino are the only countries to have banned research involving animals altogether.</p>",
  "<p>The lane to Moelyci farm in Gwynedd is fringed with harebells, and a green woodpecker flits from tree to fencepost in the morning sunshine. Behind a cluster of weathered farm buildings are fields full of endangered birds and rare fungi, where clouds of butterflies feed on \"weeds\"- such as Field Woundwort - that are on the Red Data list of threatened species.</p> <p>This is no ordinary Welsh mountain farm - and yet, until five years ago, that is exactly what it was. In 2003, intensively grazed and in the aftermath of the foot and mouth outbreak, its 320 acres were unable to support the farming tenant. But when the estate owner decided the farm should be sold - possibly for holiday accommodation - the local community had different ideas. Residents from Tregarth, Rhiwlas and Mynydd Llandegai, the three villages that surround Moelyci, in the shadow of Snowdon, dug deep and bought it.</p> <p>Around 200 people invested in the farm, forming a not-for-profit industrial and provident society (IPS), with the help of loans from Triodos Bank and ICOF, a community development finance institution that invests in areas of deprivation. It was the first venture of its kind in Wales and one of just a handful in the UK.</p> <p>Five years on, Moelyci IPS supports around 16 jobs and has 500 community shareholders. The original loans have been replaced by a mortgage, and when that is paid off, in 18 years' time, the farm and its mountain - much of which is now designated a site of special scientific interest and a special area of conservation - will really be theirs.</p> <p>\"Stubborn persistence, unfettered optimism, patience and trust\" account for the environmental, economic and community regeneration that has gone on here, according to one of Moelyci's directors, John Fazey, who lectures part-time in adaptive learning at Oxford University. </p> <p>A steady nerve is also crucial. On the day of my visit, Fazey was working hard to plug a temporary but critical \u00a320,000 deficit in their finances, caused by the delayed payment of a government grant. \"This is the third time it's happened, and always at the end of the month when we have the mortgage and wages to pay, but, luckily, one of our supporters has stepped in with a personal interest-free loan,\" sighs Fazey, who put up his own property - a neighbouring farm - as security at the outset.</p> <p>Despite the fragile financing, he says they are fulfilling their initial aims of creating sustainable jobs and recreation opportunities for local people and the less advantaged, while protecting the environment.</p> <p>A compost processing plant, which recently won a \u00a312,000 contract from Gwynedd county council to process green waste, and a timber recycling venture were part of the original plan, while a market garden has grown from an earlier project to sell saplings. An imaginative programme of wildlife, gardening and outdoor skills courses also bring in cash.</p> <p>Six core members of staff are on Moelyci's payroll, largely supported by grants and charitable funding. The Intermediate Labour Market (ILM) programme for long-term unemployed people supplies a large part of the workforce.</p> <p>The recent appointment of development manager Paul Christie, through a grant from the Tudor Trust, has been vital, Fazey says. Christie has already secured \u00a3100,000 from the Aggregates Levy Fund for the sensitive conversion of a barn into a training and meeting room.</p> <p>Responsible for the farm's burgeoning biodiversity is John Harold, an ecologist. Now on the staff, he worked as a volunteer to steer the transition from ranch-like farmland to a place brimming with wildlife that had been hanging on in the margins. \"I don't think we'd be here today if it wasn't for the funding of the biodiversity work,\" he says. \"When we realised the value of what we had, we tapped into things such as Natur Gwynedd, a biodiversity fund that was a huge support to us.\"</p> <p>Harold advises others embarking on similar projects to take stock of what is there and to rein in any ambition to \"make a mark\" on the land. However, some human intervention has been beneficial. \"When we started growing veg, those fields attracted huge flocks of birds such as linnets and yellowhammers in the winter,\" Harold says. \"Because we weren't farming too tidily, there were lots of weed seeds and insects for them.\"</p> <p><strong>Important site</strong></p> <p>Another field has now been turned over for intercropping of soft fruits and wildflowers - \"one crop for us, the other for the wildlife,\" Harold says. And a field of rare fungi, discovered by a volunteer, makes Moelyci one of the most important wax cap sites in Europe.</p> <p>Grants from Tir Gofal, the Welsh countryside stewardship programme, have paid for stockproofing of environmentally sensitive areas. Grazing by Welsh Black cattle and horses help with land management, and provide income and manure for Moelyci's 50 allotments used by local people. There are still sheep, and a shepherd grazes a small flock at favourable rates that allowed him to follow his father into farming.</p> <p>\"None of us individually could have done this,\" Harold says. \"I've never worked in an IPS or such a complex co-operative environment, or been a farmer or had a piece of land bigger than my garden to be responsible for. For all of us, it's been life changing.\"</p> <p>Paul Ellis agrees. He came to Moelyci on the ILM scheme after a year out of work. \"Then, when the market garden manager left, I got the job,\" he smiles. \"I'm paid two days a week, and [work as a] volunteer for the rest of the time. I love it.\"</p> <p>As the market garden grows, so will Ellis's paid hours. Like so much at Moelyci, it's a matter of keeping faith.</p> <h2>Local initiatives</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>In 1997, after decades of absentee landlords, the 84-strong crofting community of <strong>Eigg</strong> made history when it raised more than \u00a31.5m to buy the Hebridean island after it was put up for sale. Improved housing, community facilities, employment opportunities and the UK's first community-wide electricity grid - powered by hydro, wind and solar energy - have followed. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>In 2001, the 110 inhabitants of <strong>Gigha</strong> raised \u00a34m, with the help of the national lottery and Highlands and Islands Enterprise, to buy their remote island off the west coast of Scotland.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> On <strong>north Harris</strong>, in the Outer Hebrides, two buyouts in 2002 and 2006 have resulted in a 62,500-acre, community-owned estate consisting of 130 crofts and 17 townships.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>In 2006, <strong>Fordhall Farm</strong> at Market Drayton, Shropshire, became England's first community-owned farm, following an appeal for \u00a3800,000 to secure the tenancy.

  "<p>Tesco is to build a new business in India with cash-and-carry outlets and a deal to help develop a new chain of hypermarkets with one of the country's biggest conglomerates.</p> <p>The British supermarket chain is investing up to \u00a360m over the next two years to build three big wholesale \"hubs\" to supply small retailers, restaurants, hotels and India's 15m \"kirana\" - owner-managed general stores. The wholesale outlets will source from global suppliers and local farmers and will use the Tesco fascia.</p> <p>The first hub will be in Mumbai, and will open its doors in about 18 months. Others are planned for Delhi and Bengaluru and each one will eventually support many more smaller cash-and-carry outlets.</p> <p>Tesco has also signed a franchise deal with Trent, the retail arm of the vast Tata industrial conglomerate, to supply a new chain of Trent-owned hypermarkets called Star Bazaar. The new wholesale business will supply everything from basic foods to electronic goods.</p> <p>Tata's interests range from telecoms to engineering, including the former Corus UK steel business and the Land Rover and Jaguar marques. Its Trent offshoot operates the Westside chain of clothing stores in 19 Indian cities and the country's top books and music chain, Landmark. It has only four Star Bazaar hypermarkets but has plans to expand to 50 outlets.</p> <p>Tesco has long had ambitions to break into the Indian market, which is forecast to have a bigger population than China by 2025. </p> <p>Regulations designed to protect small family businesses prevent foreign retailers from buying or building store chains, but wholesale businesses and franchise arrangements are excluded. The supermarket chain's chief executive, Sir Terry Leahy, had hoped to do a franchise deal with Bharti in 2006, but the Indian retail group snubbed Tesco in favour of Wal-Mart.</p> <p>Yesterday Leahy said: \"Our wholesale cash-and-carry format will bring improved value, range and service to thousands of Indian businesses. We are delighted to be working with Tata, one of India's largest and most respected business groups.\" </p> <p>The new venture will be overseen by Phil Clarke, Tesco's head of IT and international development, and is the latest big step in the grocer's strategy to build big positions in important overseas markets. It already operates more than 2,000 stores in 13 countries including China and the US.

  "<p>Vast swathes of the western Amazon are to be opened up for oil and gas exploration, putting some of the planet's most pristine and biodiverse forests at risk, conservationists have warned.</p> <p>A survey of land earmarked for exploration by energy companies revealed a steep rise in recent years, to around 180 zones, which together cover an area of 688,000 sq km, almost equivalent to the size of Texas.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.plos.org/press/pone-03-08-finer.pdf\">Detailed mapping of the region</a> shows the majority of planned oil and gas projects, which are operated by at least 35 multinational companies, are in the most species-rich areas of the Amazon for mammals, birds and amphibians.</p> <p>Researchers used government information on land that has been leased to state or multinational energy companies over the past four years to create oil and gas exploration maps for western Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia and Colombia. The maps showed that in Peru and Ecuador, regions designated for oil and gas projects already cover more than two thirds of the Amazon. Of 64 oil and gas regions that cover 72% of the Peruvian Amazon, all but eight were approved since 2003. Major increases in activity are expected in Bolivia and western Brazil.</p> <p>\"We've been following oil and gas development in the Amazon since 2004 and the picture has changed before our eyes,\" said Matt Finer of <a href=\"http://www.saveamericasforests.org/\">Save America's Forests</a>, a US-based environment group. \"When you look at where the oil and gas blocks are, they overlap perfectly on top of the peak biodiversity spots, almost as if by design, and this is in one of the most, if not the most, biodiverse place on Earth.\"</p> <p>Some regions have established oil and gas reserves, but in others, companies will need to cut into the forest to conduct speculative tests, including explosive seismic investigations and test drilling. Typically, companies have seven years to explore a region before deciding whether to go into full production.</p> <p>\"The real concern is when exploration is successful and a zone moves into the development phase, because that's when the roads, drilling and pipelines come in,\" said Finer.</p> <p>Writing in the journal <a href=\"http://www.plosone.org/home.action\">PLoS One</a>, Finer and others from Duke university in North Carolina and <a href=\"http://www.landislife.org/\">Land is Life</a>, a Massachusetts-based environment group, call for governments to rethink how energy reserves in the Amazon are exploited.</p> <p>One issue, the authors argue, is that while companies must submit an environmental impact assessment for their project, these are often considered individually instead of collectively. \"They're not looking at the bigger picture of what happens if there are lots of projects going on at the same time. </p> <p>\"You could have each individual company thinking they're being relatively responsible and keeping their own road networks under control and so on, but what happens when you have 15 other projects around you? All of a sudden, when you look at the bigger picture, you have a sprawling road network,\" said Finer.</p> <p>The creation of widespread road networks will put previously inaccessible forest at risk of deforestation, illegal hunting and logging, the authors argue. </p> <p>The researchers urge companies to adopt a moratorium on new road building, and instead use helicopters to ferry personnel and machinery to and from the sites, as has been done in some locations. They also call for governments to take a broader view of the environmental impacts of new projects, by assessing them as a group rather than individually.</p> <p>Further research by the team found that many of the planned exploration and extraction projects were on land that is home to indigenous people, who whilst being consulted, have no say in whether a project goes ahead or not. At least 58 of the 64 regions in Peru are on land where isolated communities live, with a further 17 infringing areas that have existing or proposed reserves for indigenous groups.</p> <p>\"The way that oil development is being pursued in the western Amazon is a gross violation of the rights of the indigenous peoples of the region,\" said Brain Keane of Land is Life. \"International agreements and inter-American human rights law recognise indigenous peoples have rights to their lands, and explicitly prohibit the granting of concessions to exploit natural resources in their territories without their free, prior and informed consent,\" he added.</p> <p>The report adds that the international community should pay countries in the Amazon to leave forest lands untouched. Ecuador has said it will not develop its largest untapped oil reserve if it receives compensation by the end of the year, an offer that countries have yet to take them up on.</p>",
  "<p>Kira Cochrane asks (Three cheers, G2, July 12): \"Will this Olympics change the way we see women?\" Unless the media change their attitude and start reporting women's sport on a regular basis and not just during the Olympics, the answer will be a resounding no.

Four weeks ago Chrissie Wellington confirmed her status as the world's greatest female endurance athlete by winning the European Ironman Championship in Germany to complement her World Championship. Again no mention in the British press. Women are achieving in sport and given the opportunity can provide alternative role models, but the media must take a lead, given that only 2% of media coverage in sports pages is devoted to women.

  "<p>Roy Koerner, more commonly known as Fritz, who has died aged 75, was one of the four members of Sir Wally Herbert's British Transarctic Expedition which, on April 5 1969, stood at the North Pole. It was the halfway point of their dog-sled trip across the Arctic Ocean from Point Barrow, Alaska to the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, a total distance of 3,620 miles. The first surface-crossing of the Arctic Ocean, theirs was only the second confirmed expedition to reach the North Pole. Data collected from Koerner's later work on polar ice characteristics has been used heavily in the recent climate-change discussion.</p> <p>Back in 1968, Fritz and his companions had left Point Barrow on February 21, and the entire crossing took 16 months. It was supplied by airdrops from the Royal Canadian Air Force that allowed them to camp for the winter on the sea ice at a location where, conveniently, the ice drift carried them steadily towards their goal. For Fritz this was more than just a headline-seeking adventure; as a glaciologist he was studying the sea ice, and the result was the first detailed, continuous survey of its thickness and characteristics.</p> <p>Born in Portsmouth, Fritz Koerner attended Portsmouth Southern grammar school, and gained a degree in geography at Sheffield University in 1954. After a brief spell as a teacher, he joined the Falkland Islands Dependency Survey (FIDS; the precursor of the British Antarctic Survey) in 1957 for two years as meteorologist at Hope Bay (now the Argentine station of Esperanza) at the northern tip of the Antarctic peninsula. Like almost all FIDS personnel at that time, he learned to drive dogs, and made extensive trips across the sea ice and glaciers; thus, his passion for glaciology was born. It was there too that he first met Herbert.</p> <p>In 1961 he joined the Arctic Institute of North America's multi-disciplinary Devon Island Expedition as glaciologist. Having spent a reconnaissance season on the island's ice cap (covering roughly 3,600 square miles), he wintered at the expedition's base camp at Truelove Inlet (along with Alan Gill, who would later join him on the Transarctic Expedition), and in 1962 set out a radial network of mass-balance transects, stretching hundreds of miles and covering every corner of the ice cap. Such studies are aimed at determining the ice cap's \"budget\", whether it is growing, shrinking or stable. He would repeat most of these transects annually for more than 45 years, along with similar studies of the Agassiz ice cap on Canada's Ellesmere Island and much smaller Meighen Island ice cap in later years.</p> <p>On the basis of his mass-balance studies of another Canadian ice cap, that of Devon Island, Koerner received his PhD from the London School of Economics in 1968. While in London he met his future wife, Anna Kowalczyk, and after she returned to her native Poland, he reached a decision, got on his motorbike and rode to Warsaw, where he proposed to her. They were married in 1964. Anna accompanied Fritz and assisted him on Devon Island.</p> <p>Having joined the Institute of Polar Studies at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio, in 1966-67, he was a member of a team that spent the Antarctic summer season at the remote Plateau station near the summit of the Antarctic ice sheet in Dronning Maud Land at a height of 12,000ft. Here he concentrated on snow stratigraphy, and later received the US Antarctic service medal. He was one of the few people to receive Britain's polar medal with both Arctic and Antarctic clasps.</p> <p>In 1969 he and Anna moved to Ottawa, where he joined the Polar Continental Shelf Project (PCSP), a logistics and research arm of the Canadian government, to pursue his glacier studies in the high arctic; he became head of the project's ice core laboratory, and later transferred to an identical position with the Geological Survey of Canada. </p> <p>At PCSP he made oxygen-isotope studies of ice cores, extracted from the Agassiz ice cap, the cores extending from surface down to bedrock. A study of summer-melt layers in the cores revealed summer temperatures from as far back as 11,000 years ago. It is his ice-core data that has been widely used in recent exchanges about global climatic change. </p> <p>The author of more than 70 scientific papers and chapters in books, Koerner missed only a couple of field seasons from 1961 until 2008, when he felt unwell and returned to Ottawa, where he died from colon cancer just two weeks later. From his hospital bed he consulted with his colleagues to ensure that his various research projects would continue.</p> <p>After his retirement in 1999 (although he continued his research as an emeritus scientist at the Geological Survey of Canada), Fritz escorted children on Students on Ice polar cruises. His wickedly irreverent, iconoclastic sense of humour appealed to his young audiences. In the Arctic he also took the Inuit children of Grise Fiord in southern Ellesmere Island on field trips to one of the local glaciers.</p> <p>A regular competitor in the Ottawa-Montreal ski race and keen jogger, Fritz was always very fit. Anna died in 1989 after a prolonged illness. Fritz is survived by his daughters Eva, Davina and Kristina, and son Justin. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Roy Martindale \"Fritz\" Koerner, explorer and glaciologist, born July 3 1932; died May 26 2008</p>",
  "<p>The number of flights through British airspace has fallen for the first time since the post-September 11 downturn, as high fuel costs force airlines to cut back services.</p> <p>NATS, the company that handles Britain's air traffic, said it dealt with 1,401 fewer flights in July compared with the same month last year. The latest proof of sweeping flight cutbacks follows a recent announcement that the global airline industry will fly nearly 60m fewer seats in the final three months of the year.</p> <p>The fall in flights comes during the peak summer season, when the airline industry is supposed to be at its strongest. Ian Hall, director of operations at NATS, said: \"The aviation industry has always been a barometer of the wider economy so it should not come as any surprise to see a slight slowdown, particularly since the airlines have signalled some cutbacks to services.\"</p> <p>NATS said its two largest customers - Heathrow and Gatwick - broke monthly records, but the overall trend was negative. The number of transatlantic flights fell by 457, while the number of domestic flights fell by 201, though green campaigners credit the resurgence of the rail industry for much of that decline. Other flights, including services to Europe, Asia and the Middle East, dropped by more than 1,200. Although the figures show a slight increase in the year to date, growth between January and July has more than halved since last year, indicating a tailing off as the year has progressed.</p> <p>Britain's leading airlines have announced plans to slash growth or reduce capacity over the past few months. British Airways is reducing the number of seats it is flying this winter by 3%, including the termination of several routes out of Gatwick. Ryanair, Europe's largest budget airline, is grounding 20 planes over the same period and easyJet is halving expansion plans.</p> <p>Global airline capacity will fall by 7% between October and December, according to travel information company OAG, representing a deeper cut in flights than in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. One of the fastest-growing markets, Asia, will see a 13% reduction in the number of seats flown, in effect taking that market back to where it was three years ago. However, the biggest cut is in US domestic flights, the world's biggest airline market. The OAG report added that routes will be cut at 275 airports around the world.</p>",
  "<p>It is too soon to call an end to the oil price crisis that has engulfed global energy markets in the past year, the west's oil watchdog warned yesterday.</p> <p>World oil prices, which have fallen by more than $30 a barrel since the July peak, touched a three-month low yesterday with the International Energy Agency reporting that global oil supplies would be more than adequate to meet a slightly-higher-than-expected increase in demand next year.</p> <p>However, the IEA was cautious about whether the market had now reached a turning point. \"We would hesitate before automatically extrapolating the recent price trend,\" said the organisation. </p> <p>Within hours of the release of the IEA's sober assessment of the outlook for oil, the US Energy Information Administration said US demand had fallen by 800,000 barrels a day in the first half of the year, the largest decline for 26 years. It blamed slower economic growth and higher petrol prices. The EIA also cut its forecast for US oil demand for the third quarter, but revised it upwards for the final three months of the year.</p> <p>The Paris-based IEA had earlier said its \"all other things being equal\" forecast suggested easing fundamentals and potentially higher stocks of crude in the months to come.</p> <p>But it warned that such a scenario was threatened by a number of factors; disruption to supplies from Nigerian and Azerbaijan, storms hitting the Gulf of Mexico and potential delays to projects in Brazil, Canada and Russia.</p> <p>The threat posed by geo-political unrest to world oil supplies was underlined yesterday, when BP closed the Baku-Supsa gas pipeline which leads to the Georgian port of Supsa because of the conflict between Georgia and Russia.</p> <p>Last week the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) oil pipeline, which runs close to Georgia's capital Tbilisi towards the Turkish port of Ceyhan, was shut down because of an explosion unrelated to the conflict. Kurdish separatists claimed responsibility.</p> <p>The IEA said political problems could hold up Iraqi and Russian supply growth and that while the OECD demand could prove weaker than expected, inventories remained \"worryingly flat\" and demand from non-OECD countries, not least from China and the Middle East, could prove higher than expected.</p> <p>\"Add in ever-changing sentiment over Iran, and it looks too early to cite definitively a sea change in the market.\"</p> <p>The IEA said it expected global demand for oil products in 2008 to be virtually unchanged at 86.9m barrels a day and slightly higher at 87.8m barrels for 2009, on demand from outside the OECD area.</p> <p>Opec's effective spare capacity was about 1.5m barrels a day, the IEA said, but should rise later this year and into next.</p> <p>At one point yesterday US crude oil price hit its lowest level since May, at $112.48 a barrel. It then recovered to $116 but subsequently fell back to $113. Back in July it reached a peak of more than $147.</p> <p>\"Demand for Opec oil is going to be lower than its production capacity, so the market is looking forward to seeing an inventory build,\" said Olivier Jakob at trading advisory company, Petromatrix. </p> <p>Latest figures from the US showed a surprise fall in the trade deficit with a $6bn drop in non-oil imports offsetting higher energy costs.</p> <p>US commerce secretary Carlos Gutierrez said the lower than expected deficit could prompt the department to raise second-quarter economic growth from its initial estimate of 1.9%. </p> <p>\"It's a very strong month for exports,\" Gutierrez said. \"The growth is coming from Brazil, it's coming from Russia, it's coming from India, it's coming from the Middle East ... It's very broad-based.\" </p> <p>The dollar rose against the euro on news the trade gap narrowed in June, but was then hit by profit taking. </p> <p>Kurt Karl, chief US economist at Swiss Re in New York, said the better than expected figures \"will support growth going into the third quarter.\" </p> <p>However, he noted the narrowing trade deficit was more evidence that the US economy could be in a recession, because it showed consumers were buying less.</p> <p>The falling oil price has brought some relief to US motorists with the price of a gallon of fuel falling below $4 for the first time since late May. The regular Lundberg survey of filling stations found the average cost of unleaded petrol has fallen by 15 cents over two weeks to $3.85. High prices have been causing soul-searching in car-dependent parts of America. </p> <p>In some areas, employers have allowed staff to compress their workload into intensive four-day weeks to reduce commuting costs. Several towns have switched police patrols onto bicycles, charities have had to cut back on meals on wheels and rail services have reported a surge in passenger numbers.</p> <p>Republicans have called for environmentally sensitive off-shore drilling to increase long-term supplies of oil - a policy which Democrats, including the presidential candidate Barack Obama, have reluctantly begun to endorse.</p> <p>The drop in oil prices, technically a bear market after a fall of 20% from the peak, has contributed to a rally on Wall Street.</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p>The <strong>oil price </strong>more than doubled over the past year to peak at <strong>$147 </strong>a barrel in July, as producers had been unable to pump enough crude to cope with increasing demand from booming <strong>China </strong>and <strong>India</strong>. However, rising prices made it economic to boost output from large areas of marginal and highly-expensive reserves such as <strong>Canada</strong>'s<strong> </strong>tar sands. <strong>Opec</strong>, the producers' cartel, has also been pumping at its highest rate since it was created 48 years ago. But the increases in output arrived as demand from <strong>America</strong> slumped as it entered a downturn. Prices have started to fall back. Speculators who were attracted to the energy market by rising prices, have also moved elsewhere.</p>",
  "<p>Oil giant Shell misled the public when it claimed in an advertisement that its giant $10bn oil sands project in northern Canada was a \"sustainable energy source\", according to the Advertising Standards Authority.</p> <p>The tar sands cover over 140,000 square kilometres of Alberta and contain nearly 173bn barrels of oil in the form of bitumen. This is strip-mined from vast open pits and the bitumen is then heated, using far larger amounts of energy than in normal oil operations, therefore causing greater carbon dioxide emissions. A recent report suggested that the production of oil from tar sands can create up to eight times as many emissions as producing conventional oil.</p> <p>In one of the most significant \"greenwash\" rulings in some years, the independent body responsible for regulating UK advertising upheld a complaint from green campaign group WWF that Shell's advert in the Financial Times was \"misleading\". </p> <p>\"We considered that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs' (Defra) best practice guidance on environmental claims stated that green claims should not 'be vague or ambiguous, for instance by simply trying to give a good impression about general concern for the environment. Claims should always avoid the vague use of terms such as 'sustainable', 'green', 'non-polluting' and so on\", said the ASA.</p> <p>\"Defra had made that recommendation because, although 'sustainable' was a widely used term, the lack of a universally agreed definition meant that it was likely to be ambiguous and unclear to consumers. Because we had not seen data that showed how Shell was effectively managing carbon emissions from its oil sands projects in order to limit climate change, we concluded that the ad was misleading\", said the ruling.</p> <p>WWF argued that Shell was not helping provide a sustainable future by exploiting the oil sands. WWF said the oil sands were one of the world's dirtiest sources of fuel and had a major impact on the environment. \"Their extraction cannot be described as a sustainable process and for Shell to claim otherwise was wholly misleading,\" said David Norman, Director of Campaigns at WWF-UK. </p> <p>Shell had responded to the challenge that the accepted definition of the phrase \"sustainable development\" was \"development which meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs\". It argued that this definition supported strong economic and social development over time, and recognised the importance of affordable and convenient energy in achieving that, whilst underlining the importance of protecting the environment.</p> <p>Contributing towards \"sustainable development\", said the company, \"meant helping to meet the world's growing energy needs in economic, social and environmentally responsible ways, and that in all their operations they integrated economic, environmental and social considerations into their business decision making\". </p> <p>\"The ASA's decision to uphold WWF's complaint sends a strong signal to business and industry that 'greenwash' is unacceptable,\" said Norman. \"If Shell were serious about sourcing sustainable energy, then they would be far better placed investing in renewable energy, such as wind, tidal or solar power\".</p> <p>The ASA also ruled that Shell's construction of the world's largest refinery in Texas, also mentioned in the advertisement, was not helping sustainable energy production.</p>",

Charities working in those developing countries most vulnerable to rising global food and fuel prices, and domestic charities dealing with issues such as homelessness and debt relief, are likely to see demand for their services increase as their income stalls. Oxfam said this week that it was aiming to slash 10%-15% off its costs in the next financial year, with possible job losses. Although it insists this move will occur as part of its \"normal business cycle\", it acknowledges that \"the new economic reality will have implications for Oxfam's work and resources\". But how worried should charities be? Despite the portents of doom, many haven't been hit where it hurts just yet.

Without question, it's very good news that Barking and Dagenham is planning to build up to 8,000 new homes for rent and part-sale over the next decade or so - after a 30-year period in which Britain's council-housing stock was regarded as a relic to be managed, and sold off, into decline. The area is experiencing rapid growth as inhabitants of inner London boroughs seek bigger, cheaper homes further out - mostly former council houses that have been sold under the right-to-buy policy. It also has a small but loudmouthed contingent of British National party activists intent on spreading racist myths about the council's housing policy that will be knocked back squarely by a large-scale building programme.

  "<p>Mark Hughes has presented Manchester City with a test of their financial clout by demanding the acquisition of a new striker before the close of the transfer window.</p> <p>City attempted to ease growing fears over their financial future yesterday when their executive chairman, Garry Cook, insisted the club's finances had not been jeopardised by Thaksin Shinawatra's decision to flee a corruption hearing in Thailand and seek exile in Britain, leaving behind \u00a3800m in frozen assets. But the insistence it is \"business as usual\", and that Hughes does not have to sell before he can add to his squad, will be tested by the manager's transfer requirements. </p> <p>Hughes is desperate for a new striker for Sunday's Premier League opener at Aston Villa - with Blackburn Rovers' \u00a315m-rated Roque Santa Cruz his favoured choice - after Darius Vassell joined his absentee list. The former England international will be out for three months with a knee ligament injury sustained against Milan on Saturday and the City manager will choose from Valeri Bojinov, who is short of match fitness as he recovers from a serious knee problem, Rolando Bianchi, Felipe Caicedo and the teenagers Danny Sturridge and Ched Evans for the trip to Villa.</p> <p>Hughes has made only two purchases since his arrival from Blackburn in June, the record \u00a318m signing Jo, the Brazil striker who is on Olympic duty, and the defender Tal Ben Haim. He dug his heels in over the proposed \u00a38m sale of Vedran Corluka to Tottenham Hotspur and the frustrated Welshman, whose side face FC Midytjlland of Denmark in the Uefa Cup second qualifying round tomorrow, is adamant his squad needs strengthening to challenge for a top-six finish this season.</p> <p>Cook, appointed by Thaksin to promote City as a global brand, insisted the former Thai prime minister remained committed to his \"10-year vision\" for the club and denied reports that the owner arranged an emergency \u00a32m loan from the former chairman John Wardle last season. Thaksin, the subject of an arrest warrant issued by the Thai authorities on Monday, may face a second test of his \"fit and proper person\" status by the Premier League.</p> <p>The league is waiting to consider the outcome of the corruption trial in Thailand which will directly affect whether Thaksin fails its \"fit and proper person\" test. Should he be convicted, even in absentia, a spokesman confirmed the league would seek legal advice as to how best to proceed with this case taking it into uncharted territory, specifically over whether it can force Thaksin to sell City.</p> <p>\"City's future is not in jeopardy,\" insisted Cook. \"In the short-term, it is business as usual. We don't rely on Dr Thaksin's money. When Mark Hughes makes a decision we go through the normal process, which can include banks, finance or a whole bunch of different things just like any other club.\"</p> <p>Cook did confirm, however, that the billionaire would continue to seek new investment in the club as he struggles to realise the ambition of taking City into the Champions League out of his own pocket. \"He is willing to look at whatever it takes to make City a great football club. This is a guy who loves City,\" he added. </p> <p>The executive chairman met Thaksin in Beijing recently: \"It was really clear he wants to be at this football club for the next 10 years. He wants to build a dynasty and he was disappointed that people think he wanted to get in and back out.\"</p>",
  "<p>There I was in Provence a week or two ago, not sitting in the sun and not drinking ros\u00e9 (incidentally, I don't believe the allegation recently peddled in the press that sales of ros\u00e9 in France are now exceeding those of white wine; that cannot be), but thoroughly enjoying reading a lengthy and erudite essay by Mark Lawson in the Guardian on the subject of sport in fiction. I eagerly turned the page to read on, but there was no more. Not possible, I thought. Where was boxing? I read the feature again. There was no mention of it. The sport that I had proclaimed - no, proved - in this very column, to have provided more top-class fiction than any other, had been ignored, zeroed, as if it had never existed. I refer to my own writings only to mention that not one of the many readers who reacted to my piece, either personally or on the blog, contested my conclusion. Most drew my attention to other novels and short stories with a sporting centre - including boxing books I had omitted through ignorance. None suggested that any other sport attracted better writing than boxing, nor did Lawson's learned list suggest the literary pre-eminence of any other sport.</p> <p>I don't intend to repeat my full argument. In the unlikely event that you do not remember every detail of what I wrote on January 3 2007, the article is on the net. In addition to the books and writers I noted - among them, Leonard Gardner's Fat City, Budd Schulberg's The Harder They Fall, FX Toole's Rope Burns (which contains the short story Million Dollar Baby), Jack London, Ernest Hemingway, Conan Doyle, Damon Runyon, Dashiell Hammett and Ring Lardner - you can add WC Heinz's The Professional (1958), a huge influence on Elmore Leonard and regarded by Hemingway as the best book about a fighter he had ever read. </p> <p>Coincidentally, before the Guardian feature appeared, I had been reading with admiration Boxing: a Cultural History, by Kasia Boddy, a serious yet entertaining study, packed with obscure facts and accompanied by a huge selection of marvellous photos and illustrations.</p> <p>I can now make another claim, and I defy anyone to say otherwise. There are far more quality films with boxing at their core than any other sport. Baseball comes second, I'm pretty sure. Field of Dreams, Eight Men Out, The Natural and Bull Durham come to mind. Athletics has Chariots of Fire and The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner. Soccer provides only one good offering, The Goalkeeper's Fear of the Penalty (well, OK, I'll grant you Bend It Like Beckham); rugby league has This Sporting Life; cricket has the excellent if long (nearly four hours) Lagaan, and the less impressive The Final Test, worth noting only because Len Hutton and Denis Compton play themselves - badly. But boxing has Fat City (directed by John Huston), Requiem for a Heavyweight, Champion (starring Kirk Douglas), The Harder They Fall (Humphrey Bogart's last role), Million Dollar Baby (Oscars galore), Raging Bull (an Oscar for Robert De Niro), The Great White Hope, Body and Soul, and I haven't even needed to mention Rocky and its best film Oscar.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> I have been astonished and annoyed by how easily most of the media here were taken in by wild information bandied around concerning the number of viewers watching the Beijing Olympics opening ceremony live on television. A few days before the event, some publicity person, presumably Chinese, hit on a number: 4 billion viewers. And almost every newspaper, television network and journalist seemed to accept it as gospel, and spread it around. A minute's thought would have told them that such a viewing figure - nearly two-thirds of the world's population - was, by a long way, impossible. Think of the masses who wouldn't be watching, because of poverty, or because they are too young, or at work or asleep, or - do not underestimate this - because they were just not interested. The BBC's broadcast was watched by around five million - less than a twelfth of our population - and the global estimate has been revised to 1 billion, which I suppose is possible. But that's been scantily reported, and I bet that in years to come, Beijing's opening extravaganza will still be reported as having attracted 4 billion viewers. Does it matter? Not in itself, but it is all to do with being able to trust the media, and that's important.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> I do not know why the chef Rick Stein was on the Today programme arguing that cooking ought to be regarded as an art, but I think the answer to this debate is easy. The highest forms of cuisine are creative, imaginative, beautiful, appeal to several of the senses and can touch spirituality. It's not permanent, but then neither is a dance or a theatre performance; it relies on ingredients, but then so does a sculptor rely on his marble or wood. Eating, and therefore cooking, is a necessity, whereas creating or receiving other forms of art is voluntary. </p> <p>So what? I can see no logical argument for great cooking to be denied the status of art, with the added advantage that it will become eligible for the Turner prize, hitherto more famous for works of art associated with orifices far from the mouth.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This week Marcel read <strong>John Williams's biography of Michael X</strong>: \"Absorbing, politically and socially astute.

  "<p>No one seriously expected that the two-week time frame <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/22/zimbabwe\">laid down</a> in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/22/4\">the July 21 memorandum of understanding</a> would be met. That time frame was a marker: the issues were too serious, and the divisions between the principal stakeholders, Morgan Tsvangirai's MDC and Robert Mugabe's Zanu-PF, were too great for an easy solution. Indeed, a quick settlement would have been greeted with scepticism by Zimbabweans, because it would indicate that there had been a wholesale capitulation by one side to the demands of the other side. In politics, as in life, there are no free lunches. </p> <p>The chief negotiators have been locked in talks in Pretoria and Harare since the memorandum was signed. There have been few official progress updates, other than bland announcements that progress is being made, that there are \"sticking points\", but that the talks are continuing. Although the two-week time frame has clearly not been met, all stakeholders are intensely aware that time is of the essence. President Mbeki, chief mediator in the talks, will be attending the SADC heads of government meeting on August 16-17, and he desperately wants, and needs, to be able to report on tangible progress in the talks. For Robert Mugabe and Zanu-PF, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/01/zimbabwe.economics\">recent revaluation</a> of the Zimbabwe dollar and a rash of other currency changes may have made it easier to count the money, but in real terms, it has all the effectiveness of putting a sticking plaster on a cancer. Zimbabwe's inflation rate and soaring cost of living have become untenable for millions of Zimbabweans, and there is the very real prospect of mass starvation if a political solution is not found. This, in itself, is not what is driving Zanu-PF to negotiate; sooner rather than later, there will be no funds left in the national coffers to pay the security sector and, as sanctions begin to bite, there will be no remaining avenues for raising funds. For Tsvangirai's MDC, there is the very real risk that if it fails to reach agreement, there will be a return to violence and a likely internal settlement between Zanu-PF and the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4756424.stm\">Mutambara</a> faction of the MDC. </p> <p>The first and fundamental question is whether the two sides are discussing a government of national unity (GNU), similar to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gukurahundi\">1987 unity accord</a> between Zanu and Zapu (which led to the demise of the latter); or a transitional authority. In purely emotional terms, Zanu-PF would prefer a GNU, because, for them, it revives happy memories of the 1987 agreement which allowed Zanu-PF to consolidate its power at the expense of Zapu. In practical terms, a GNU as political endpoint would offer a way out for Zanu-PF. The GNU would have a shelf life of up to five years \u2013 plenty of time for the party to regroup, rebrand itself as the \"new Zanu-PF\" by moving towards the political centre, and begin the subtle \"Zanu-fication\" of the MDC. A long-term coalition partnership between the MDC and Zanu-PF would restrict the former's moral and practical room for manoeuvre. Just as importantly, a GNU would shelve the \"norm\" pushed by western governments of a \"winner takes all\", maximalist electoral democracy, which would result in Zanu-PF becoming the party of opposition. A transitional government with a limited life of two years, a constitutional review and credible elections within that period, would place the political process more within the MDC's control, because this would allow the MDC to present the authority as a necessary, but temporary phase on the road to transformation, alleviating charges that the MDC had \"sold out\" to Zanu-PF.</p> <p>The relative role and powers of Mugabe and Tsvangirai are the issues that have caused the most acrimony. Initially, both men wanted the executive presidency, but Mugabe made it clear that this was a non-negotiable condition. The question, then, was: if not the presidency, then what role for Tsvangirai? The answer: he would become prime minister, with Mugabe as president. This much was expected, and tallies with Zimbabwe's political tradition of strongly executive prime ministers and ceremonial presidents, dating back to Rhodesian days. </p> <p>There has thus been much speculation that Tsvangirai will become an executive prime minister, while Mugabe becomes a figurehead. This will not happen, any more than Tsvangirai would agree to become a figurehead prime minister \u2013 all frequent flier miles and no substance. Neither will he permit himself to become a hollow man. </p> <p>Each side, therefore, has accused the other of delaying a deal by insisting on power. Is Tsvangirai right in insisting on some degree of power? Absolutely: a transitional government, which answers only to Mugabe, will not bring progress to Zimbabwe; nor will it bring in investment. In addition, it is vital that the MDC demonstrates that it can be a tough negotiator if it is to gain respect from Zanu-PF and end the perennial criticism that they are political babes in the wood. </p> <p>Hard power requires hard talk. There will probably be a laborious \"<a href=\"http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/IRIN/ff804c16a66945a8b90323e5e36f63e9.htm\">French model</a>\", by which authority is parcelled out in gobbets to both men. The MDC does have to be realistic, however: Mugabe's authority will certainly be gradually reduced over time, and this is crucial for Zimbabwe's reconstruction, but attempting to remove him from the frame now could actually be counter-productive. No one can deny that Mugabe is certainly a huge part of the problem \u2013 but he is also part of the solution, particularly with regard to the hardliners in the security sector. Assuming that he is \"incentivised\", Mugabe is the only figure with enough authority to corral the militants within the security apparatus, and push them to create an enabling environment for peace. In addition, there is the question of \"saving face\"; even as the 2008 Heroes' Day celebrations <a href=\"http://www.talkzimbabwe.com/news/117/ARTICLE/3152/2008-08-11.html\">are dedicated</a> to Joshua Nkomo, it is clear that the dedication is not merely to try and appropriate Zapu's legacy, but also for Mugabe to send a coded warning that he does not intend to meet the same fate as Nkomo.</p> <p>And so begins the internal scramble for Zimbabwe, as both sides parcel out portfolios, as if playing a game of <a href=\"http://216.239.59.104/search?q=cache:0BBuyUHYgtwJ:www.jpanafrican.com/docs/vol2no4/2.4_Shona_Traditional_Children.pdf+nhodo&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=6&amp;gl=uk\">nhodo</a>. The security sector won't budge on the army, air force, CIO and home affairs ministry, all of which they see as strategic sectors. The MDC will get the police, finance and, possibly, agriculture, but they'll have a tough task to prise foreign affairs from Zanu-PF. Reportedly, there are plans afoot to replace the <a href=\"http://www.hararetribune.com/index.php?news=18\">JOC</a> with a national security council (NSC), which would include representatives from both parties. The 2006 national security council, which contained the military top brass, set up nine taskforces to manage Zimbabwe's crumbling economy. The role of the security sector is a major issue: the MDC's adherence to non-violent change has given it a moral authority, which Zanu-PF utterly lacks, but it also allows the generals to claim that the MDC officials are civilians who don't deserve a place at the military table. The power of the military will not be broken in the short term, but it is vital for the agreement to create mechanisms to dilute its power. This means making the military accountable to parliament. Parliament itself has to be depoliticised \u2013 in the best sense of the word \u2013 and re-professionalised. If the NSC is created, it will need representation from civilian as well as military stakeholders, and it must be a transitional mechanism with a finite term of duty and roles.</p> <p>Much has been said about the MDC's parliamentary majority as providing leverage against Zanu-PF during the negotiations. While its majority is important, we shouldn't kid ourselves that this is what has driven Zanu-PF to the table. The MDC's majority is, after all, notional \u2013 they are heavily dependent on the mercurial Mutambara faction for this majority, and Mutambara's group seesaws between the two key stakeholders. Zanu-PF is a past master at using political carrots and sticks, in parliament and elsewhere, to have its way. The numbers are a start, but the real issue is how to end the culture of political corruption and militarism which has become all-pervasive. </p> <p>The key lies in building into the agreement processes, which will re-professionalise and empower Zimbabwe's political institutions. This entails a pragmatic, functional compact between political sector, business, the security sector and civil society. The relationship between the soldiers and civil society, in particular, has been poisonous, yet both sides will have to put aside their prejudices to make an agreement work; this is not yet a time for abolitionists. If the MDC cannot sit at the soldiers' top table, it has to push for authority over the judiciary, because, in the long term, this is the ministry that will determine Zimbabwe's long-term governance. A deal that allows Zanu-PF to retain control over the soldiers and the judges will leave the status quo intact. </p> <p>In addition, strengthening parliamentary committees and oversight mechanisms is an essential component of reintroducing parliamentary accountability. In the 1980s, we used to have a prime minister's question time \u2013 the symbolic significance of reintroducing this would be very valuable. </p> <p>Will the final deal essentially be an elite compact, an ambivalent hybrid agreement, which doesn't represent the real wishes of Zimbabweans? The secrecy surrounding the negotiations does not inspire confidence. For both Zanu-PF supporters, but more so for the MDC supporters, there are serious concerns as to what kind of deal is being made. There has been little consultation with the people, and there is little chance of a referendum to ratify or reject whatever is hammered out. </p> <p>There is also the question of external agendas. Who ultimately benefits from a final agreement? The MDC needs a deal it can \"sell\" to London and Washington; Mugabe needs a deal which he can sell to the hawks in the JOC; Mbeki needs a deal he can sell to SADC and the African Union. But will it be a deal that addresses the real needs of ordinary Zimbabweans? </p> <p>The question of transitional justice is vital. There is a huge moral imperative to try the organisers and perpetrators of political violence, but the sobering reality is that the generals will not be tried anytime soon. Much has been said about giving a \"soft landing\" to the security sector; for the soldiers, who, after all, are the ones in power, the issue is more one of giving a \"soft landing\" to the MDC. The military will not agree to detailed proposals for human rights tribunals. What may be agreed is a diluted annexe to any agreement, which stipulates the need for compensation to be paid to the victims of violence, but which doesn't directly blame Zanu-PF; and a broad agreement on the need for justice against the perpetrators of the violence. There will be nothing specific, and the question of justice and compensation for the 1980s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gukurahundi\">Gukurahundi</a> and 2000-2008 atrocities will not be directly addressed. </p> <p>In the short term, the deal will trade peace for justice. The talks will proceed in fits and starts, but ultimately a deal will be reached. It is likely to be a collage, a democ<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimurenga\">urenga</a> accord; but at least it will be a start.</p>",
  "<p>The number of flights through British airspace has fallen for the first time since the post-September 11 downturn, as high fuel costs force airlines to cut back services.</p> <p>NATS, the company that handles the UK's air traffic, said it dealt with 1,401 fewer flights in July compared with the same month last year. The latest proof of sweeping flight cutbacks follows a recent announcement that the global airline industry will fly nearly 60m fewer seats in the final three months of the year.</p> <p>The fall in flights comes during the peak summer season, when the airline industry is supposed to be at its strongest. Ian Hall, director of operations at NATS, said: \"The aviation industry has always been a barometer of the wider economy so it should not come as any surprise to see a slight slowdown, particularly since the airlines have signalled some cutbacks to services.\"</p> <p>NATS said its two largest customers \u2014 Heathrow and Gatwick \u2014 broke monthly records, but the overall trend was negative. The number of transatlantic flights fell by 457, while the number of domestic flights fell by 201, although green campaigners credit the resurgence of the rail industry for much of that decline. </p> <p>Other flights, including services to Europe, Asia and the Middle East, dropped by more than 1,200. Although the figures show a slight increase in the year to date, growth between January and July has more than halved since last year, indicating a tailing off as the year has progressed.</p> <p>The UK's leading airlines have unveiled plans to slash growth or reduce capacity over the past few months. British Airways is reducing the number of seats it is flying this winter by 3%, including the termination of several routes out of Gatwick. Ryanair, Europe's largest budget airline, is grounding 20 planes over the same period and easyJet is halving expansion plans.</p> <p>Global airline capacity will fall by 7% between October and December, according to travel information company OAG, representing a deeper cut in flights than in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. One of the fastest-growing markets, Asia, will see a 13% reduction in the amount of seats flown, effectively taking that market back to where it was three years ago. </p> <p>However, the biggest cut is in US domestic flights, the world's biggest airline market. The OAG report added that routes will be cut at 275 airports around the world.</p>",
  "<p>I'm short of reasons to be tearful at the prospect of Labour returning to opposition and the <a href=\"http://www.conservatives.com/tile.do?def=webcameron.index.page\">glistening, listening Dave</a> taking its place. As a \"natural Labour voter\" who hasn't favoured the party with his \"x\" at a general election since 1987 this distress deficit comes as no surprise. A more novel sentiment is my lack of consuming gloom at the prospect of the Tories back in power. It's time to test this indifference: as wind again fills true blue sails it remains far from clear what sort of craft relaunched Conservatism is or which direction it is sailing in.</p> <p>Consider the good ship Boris, flagship of the Tory fleet now moored triumphantly on the Thames by Tower Bridge. Mayor Johnson has resisted most suggestions that his mayoralty be seen as a petri dish (<a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a2cf2d18-67bb-11dd-8d3b-0000779fd18c.html\">his metaphor</a>) for national Tory policy, yet his signature ambitions - a greener and safer environment, fixing a frayed social fabric and providing \"value for money\" at the same time \u2013 harmonise with Cameron's tunes. </p> <p>As such his Tory London should offer important insights into any future Tory Britain. Yet it's hard to make firm judgments so far. Most of the verdicts on Mayor Johnson's first 100 days confirmed the milestone as a media confection. Fans have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/07/boris.london\">applauded</a> the clearing out of the alleged \"Kenocracy\" or the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2008/08/10/do1005.xml\">absence of gaffes</a>. Foes have cried \"told you so\" over the predictable axing of Livingstone policies that had barely, <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article1399058.ece\">if at all</a>, come into effect or pointed to the resignations of Ray Lewis and James McGrath as evidence of endemic incompetence. This, though, is mostly post-election skirmishing. And while it's true that Johnson's transition has at times been <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/value-for-money/final-report.jsp\">facile</a> and chaotic (not to mention <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/jun/19/london.boris\">forgetful</a> and <a href=\"http://davehill.typepad.com/london3ms/2008/08/mayoral-adviser.html\">expensive</a>) this has, if anything, made its true character still harder to divine.</p> <p>His words and deeds have sometimes suggested contradiction and compromise. There's the contrast between his insistence on the joys of London's cultural multiplicity (and even actions to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2008/07/24/haringey_wardscorner_feature.shtml\">preserve</a> it) and the <a href=\"http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-magazine/features/13940/the-lefts-war-on-britishness.thtml\">essentialist polemics</a> of Anthony Browne, his disagreeable choice as policy director. Hustings rhetoric is already proving difficult to translate into consistent action. For example, Johnson has been <a href=\"http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-mayor/article-23527424-details/Mayor+%27breaking+promises+over+\u00a375m+skyscraper+on+market+site%27/article.do\">accused</a> of breaking promises to restrain the spread of skyscrapers and protect London's small shops. Here is a new manifestation of that old tension between Conservatism's pro-market fervour and its conservationist urges; between big capitalism and the localism Cameron has championed. Can Johnson resolve it?</p> <p>For me, the most important measure of resurgent Conservatism's credibility will be Johnson's approach to addressing the roots of youth crime and disaffection. His highlighting of the issue was convenient for his campaign - it helped make the \"out-of-touch\" charge stick to his opponent - but that didn't mean it hasn't become welcome. Now, having talked the talk, he has to walk the walk. <a href=\"http://cms.met.police.uk/met/boroughs/enfield/04how_are_we_doing/news/operation_blunt_2\">Operation Blunt 2</a> may have its short-term value, but there's always another knife in the kitchen drawer. Diverting delinquent urban youths on to the path of virtue will be a massive, long-term task. Results are hard to achieve, difficult to quantify and may never impress electors frightened not only by headlines but also by the direct and shuddering impact of gangs and stabbings on their neighbourhoods. Johnson is hungry for progress. Does he yet truly understand how to secure it?</p> <p>In other areas Johnson has implied - rather more than he has actually declared - that his policy outcomes will be more (for want of a better term) progressive than those of his predecessor as mayor. He reckons to provide the same amount of \"affordable\" housing - an additional 50,000 units - as Livingstone promised but by more <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/12/boris.london\">flexible and socially constructive means</a>. Greens are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/08/boris.london\">deeply sceptical</a>, yet Johnson remains committed the same reduction in CO2 emissions by 2025. We could even have a sparkling debate about whether his obvious urge to take the <a href=\"http://www.boriswatch.co.uk/2008/06/15/rise-and-fall-of-anti-racism/\">agitational politics</a> out of equality and discrimination issues - and some of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/11/boris.gayrights?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=commentisfree\">funding</a> too - means he's washing his hands of them or that he's made the sound assessment that such causes have become mainstream and will now prosper best there. Johnson often says that he wishes to devolve power and proceed by cooperation rather than by controlling from the centre. All these positions enact Cameroonian themes. </p> <p>So can this kind of Conservatism improve London? If so, could it improve the rest of Britain too? We'll have a far better idea by this time next year, especially as a flailing economy takes its toll. As John Kampfner has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/12/davidcameron.conservatives\">observed</a>, the leafy, touchy, feely and - to many old school Tories - rather alarming David Cameron of 2006 has lately been in retreat and a less generous, more <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4290298.ece\">glib</a>, more recession-minded model has come to the fore. Will Mayor Johnson end up the same way and my moderate optimism about him prove unfounded? If so, that will be a shame. If not and his mayoralty does indeed become a model for a Tory government I might yet end up still more reconciled to the thought of David Cameron as prime minister. What a weird and unsettling idea.</p>",

  "<p>Go to the house of just about any of Malawi's three million subsistence farmers around maize-planting time, and it's easy to tell how the family is faring by the amount of fertiliser they have. Usually, there's a bag of urea in the corner of the single room. </p> <p>It's treated like a god, because Malawians depend on maize for their staple diet, and a good crop of maize depends entirely on the amount of fertiliser that is applied. </p> <p>Never mind the damage that fertiliser does to the soil; in the short term, <a href=\"http://www.actionaid.org.uk/655/malawi.html\">Malawi's farmers face a bleak year</a>. Take Patrick Kamzitu, who rents an acre or two of land just outside Nambuma in western Malawi. Last year he paid about 3,000 kwacha (about \u00a311) for a 50kg bag. It is now an astronomical 12,000 kwacha (\u00a344) a bag and he just cannot afford the usual six bags of soil additives he normally buys. </p> <p>The result, he says, will be that families will go hungry for longer next year, and the incomes of all but the very rich will fall. \"No-one can afford fertiliser this year. The result will be very bad for everyone\", he told me.</p> <p>In theory, Malawian farmers can get government credits, or vouchers, to subsidise fertiliser purchases, but the well-intentioned subsidy programme has collapsed after commercial farmers took advantage of it. No credit is available for small farmers to borrow money since the rural credit programme has also collapsed.</p> <p>Fertiliser is the most political of all the commodities, even more so than oil. Its price has doubled, trebled or even quintupled in the last year as the oil price has spiralled, and demand for fertiliser has spiralled as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/12/biofuels.food\">biofuel crops</a> have been planted in vast quantities. Round the world, governments with large rural populations who have elections coming up are borrowing as much money as they can from the World bank and others to buy fertiliser.</p> <p>The political fate of Malawi and elsewhere may depend on the price of the grey stuff in Patrick's front room, as much as any hopes of a better long term future.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2008/aug/11/endangeredspecies.wildlife?picture=336356668\">Britain's honeybees</a> have suffered catastrophic losses this year, according to a survey of the nation's beekeepers, contributing to a shortage of honey and putting at risk the pollination of fruits and vegetables.</p> <p>The survey by the <a href=\"http://www.britishbee.org.uk/\">British Beekeepers' Association</a> (BBKA) revealed that nearly one in three of the UK's 240,000 honeybee hives did not survive this winter and spring.</p> <p>The losses are higher than the one in five colonies reported dead earlier this year by the government after 10% of hives had been inspected. </p> <p>The BBKA president, Tim Lovett, said he was very concerned about the findings: \"Average winter bee losses due to poor weather and disease vary from between 5% and 10%, so a 30% loss is deeply worrying. This spells serious trouble for pollination services and honey producers.\"</p> <p><br>The <a href=\"https://secure.csl.gov.uk/beebase/\">National Bee Unit</a> has attributed high bee mortality to the wet summer in 2007 and in the early part of this spring that confined bees to their hives. This meant they were unable to forage for nectar and pollen and this stress provided the opportunity for pathogens to build up and spread.</p> <p>But the BBKA says the causes are unclear. Its initial survey of 600 members revealed a marked north-south divide, with 37% bee losses in the north, compared to 26% in the south. \"We don't know why there is a difference and what is behind the high mortality,\" said Lovett.</p> <p>The government recognises that the UK's honeybee hives - run by 44,000 mostly amateur beekeepers - contribute around \u00a3165m a year to the economy by pollinating many fruits and vegetables. \"30% fewer honeybee colonies could therefore cost the economy some \u00a350m and put at risk the government's crusade for the public to eat five portions of fresh fruit and vegetables a day,\" Lovett warned.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/54440/No-British-honey-by-Christmas-as-bees-suffer\">Honey Association</a> warned last month that English honey will run out by Christmas and no more will be available until summer 2009. It blames the shortage on fewer honeybees and farmers devoting more fields to wheat, which has soared in price but does not produce nectar.</p> <p>The UK's leading honey company is so concerned by the crisis that it has pledged to donate money to honeybee research. From next month, for each jar of Rowse English honey sold in supermarkets 10p will be donated to a fund dedicated to improving the health of the nation's honeybees.</p> <p>Stuart Bailey, chairman of Rowse Honey said: \"We are working with the UK Bee Farmers' Association and are sponsoring research to the minimum value of \u00a325,000 over the next 12 months to selectively breed a hardier bee that can better withstand parasites and diseases.\" </p> <p>Rowse's clear English honey comes mainly from the borage plant, also known as starflower, which has been grown increasingly as a source of a fatty acid rich in omega-6 for pharmaceutical products. But farmers have planted much less borage this year as ready-processed borage oil is being imported and wheat is more profitable to grow due to the increase in demand for biofuels.</p> <p>Bailey added that the shortage had been exacerbated by an 11% rise in demand for English honey over the last year. </p> <p>Although British honey only accounts for 10% of the 30,000 tonnes of honey consumed in the UK, other major honey producing countries have also been severely hit by poor weather and bee diseases. Argentina is the world's honey pot, producing up to 75,000 tonnes a year - three times that of its nearest rival Mexico. But Argentina has suffered a 27% drop in yield due to droughts and the planting of huge swathes of land with soya beans for biofuel. As a result, there has been a 60% rise in the price of raw honey.</p> <p>In the US, honey yields have been decimated by honeybee loses of 36%, many due to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/may/08/wildlife.endangeredspecies\">colony collapse disorder</a> (CCD), a mysterious disappearance linked to the blood-sucking varroa mite, lethal viruses, malnutrition, pesticides, and a lack of genetic diversity. CCD has spread to Canada, France, Germany and Italy but has not yet been confirmed by government in the Britain.</p> <p>The BBKA is calling on the the UK government to put \u00a38m over five years into researching honeybee losses and improving bee health.</p> <p>Farming minister, Lord Rooker, has predicted the demise of the honeybee within a decade. Last November, he told parliament: \"We do not deny that honeybee health is at risk. Frankly, if nothing is done about it, the honeybee population could be wiped out in 10 years.\"</p> <p>Yet the <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/\">Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs</a> (Defra) spends just \u00a31.3m on bee health each year- less than one per cent of the bees' value to the economy - with an additional \u00a3200,000 for research.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.nfuonline.com/\">National Farmer's Union</a> said it was essential for government to increase its funding of honeybee research. \"Research is vital into varroa, bee breeding and the Nosema parasite,\" said Chris Hartfield, NFU horticultural adviser. \"We are talking about food security and world food supplies being put at risk.\"</p> <p>Defra said a further \u00a390,000 had been allocated to the NBU this year to expand investigations into colony losses. It is currently consulting on a honeybee health strategy, with responses required by the end of this month. </p> <p>A Defra spokesman said: \"Significant public funds are already provided to support this area of work but to ensure this intervention is effective, it it vital that work is driven by a well thought out strategy agreed by all relevant parties.\"</p>",
  "<p>A global fertiliser crisis caused by high oil prices and the US rush to biofuel crops is reducing the harvests of the world's poorest farmers and could lead to millions more people going hungry, according to the UN and global food analysts.</p> <p>Optimism that soaring food commodity prices could lift millions of developing country farmers out of poverty and lead to more food being grown have been dashed, says the UN. This is because small farmers either consume their own crop or have no access to global markets to take advantage of the higher food prices. </p> <p>There is little prospect of relief. A world fertiliser forecast report, due to be published by the UN this week but seen by the Guardian, states that prices will remain high for at least three years and possibly longer.</p> <p>Fertiliser prices have mostly doubled and in some cases risen by 500% in 15 months as US farmers have rushed to plant more biofuel crops and countries such as India and China have bought fertiliser stocks in large quantities to guarantee their food stocks.</p> <p>But while the unprecedented price explosion has barely affected large commercial farmers, it is leading directly to civil unrest among small farmers in developing countries. There have been fertiliser riots or demonstrations in Vietnam, India, Kenya, Nepal, Nigeria, Egypt, Pakistan and Taiwan in the last few months. Last week one man was killed in a stampede at a government handout of fertiliser in Hyderabad, India.</p> <p>Senior UN Food and Agriculture organisation analyst Dr Jan Poulisse warned the poor were being hurt the most by the crisis. \"High commodity prices allow commercial farmers in developed countries to cope with high fertiliser prices. But rising food prices hurt subsistence farmers, particularly in Africa,\" Poulisse told the Guardian. \"People just cannot afford [fertiliser]. They were in dire straits before, but now the situation is worse.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/environment/2008/08/the_impact_of_fertiliser_price.html\">Farmers in sub-Saharan Africa</a> have been hardest hit because they have the least chance to benefit from soaring food prices on the world market, but desperately need fertilisers to replenish nutrient-depleted soils.</p> <p>World fertiliser prices have risen more than oil or any other commodities in the last 18 months. Of the three main types, diammonium phosphate (Dap) sold for US $250 per tonne in January 2007 but has risen to $1,230 per tonne. Potash-based fertilisers have risen from $172 to over $500 a tonne, and nitrogen based fertilisers have risen from $277 to over $450 per tonne.<br> Much of the price rise is attributed to first world farmers who have applied high levels of fertilisers to maximise harvests of grain to take advantage of record grain prices, said Dr Balu Bumb, policy leader at the International centre for Soil Fertility and Agricultural Development (IFDC) in the US.</p> <p>The UN fertiliser forecast blames capacity constraints for the price rises. \"Strong global demand for fertilisers is stretching current production capacity to its technical limits. This situation will persist until new capacity comes on line\", it states.</p> <p>\"It can take 5-7 years to open a phosphate mine, 10 years for a potash mine and three years for a major nitrogen plant\", said Dr Poulisse, one of the report's authors. At least 50 new plants to make nitrogen fertiliser are believed to be under construction, and phosphorous and potassium mines are being expanded.</p> <p>Fertiliser prices have in the past been largely controlled by governments because they are so politically sensitive. But keeping prices down in the current crisis is now impacting heavily on other areas, such as education and health. </p> <p>India is expecting to have to spend $24bn supporting fertiliser prices this year compared to only $4bn three years ago and countries such as Malawi have had to borrow millions to introduce a fertiliser subsidy programme. However, the president of Malawi admitted last week that the subsidy programme was failing the poor. \"Sadly, it is the rich who are benefiting a great deal. They are selling maize to the poor at exorbitant prices,\" he said.</p> <p>Agriculture and development experts say the world has few alternatives to its growing dependence on fertiliser. As population increases and a rising global middle class demands more food, fertiliser has become the preferred route to higher yields.</p> <p>\"Rises in basic commodity prices should be good for small growers but we are seeing that agri-business is reaping all the benefits. It needs a fundamental reform of the way agriculture is managed as well as more sustainable farming\", said Amy Barry, an Oxfam spokeswoman.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Los Angeles.<br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Michael Vidal (guitar, vocals), Juan Valasquez (vocals, guitar), Reggie Guerrero (bass), Dave Reichardt (drums).</p> <p><strong>The background:</strong> Abe Vigoda, named after the veteran Hollywood actor who portrayed mobster Sal Tessio in The Godfather, won't put a horse's head in your bed, but they are making a racket you wouldn't be able to refuse even if you took the cotton wool out of Marlon Brando's mouth and wedged it in your ears.</p> <p>They're the latest American exponents of lush, tropical punk, of gamelan grunge, of Afrobeat noisepop, and there will be a lot of fuss made about them this autumn in the press. They're harder and more aggressive in sound than Vampire Weekend but the intent is similar: to mix up the rhythms and melodies of highlife with rock's energy and urge to overkill. Their forthcoming album Skeletons - not their first, but the first to gain them worldwide exposure - is a relentless affair, like being attacked by a steel band playing Stooges songs at double speed. But blink and you'll miss them. There are 14 tracks on Skeletons, the longest at 3 minutes 42 seconds, the shortest, Whatever Forever, comprising 44 seconds of amplified static and interference, like hearing My Bloody Valentine and kid606 having a barney in a blizzard. Most of the songs come in at the one or two-minute mark, but they cram so much into each one, there are so many jerky snippets and snatches, tempo twitches and changes of pace, it takes several plays to take in what's going on. <br> Yesterday's NBOTD name-checked Orange Juice, citing them as the godfathers of jingly-jangly indie, which they sort-of were. Abe Vigoda are truer to the Scottish band's original determination to be a white rock band playing African rhythms - that they got it so wrong but somehow so right, was one of those happy accidents. In fact, Abe Vigoda's song Lantern Heights recalls those other early-80s pioneers of scratchy Scottish funk, the Fire Engines. Before they decided to sound like Pavement wrestling with King Sunny Ade or a post-rock band doing disgraceful things to Paul Simon's Graceland, Abe Vigoda were high-school dance-punks with a penchant for no wave and new wave, making few waves with old ideas and tired strategies. Then they became involved in the unappetisingly titled The Smell, an all-ages arts/performance space in downtown LA where experimental bands with names like No Age, Magik Markers, Old Time Relijun, Health and Mika Miko do avant-garde things with a DIY attitude. Abe Vigoda look set to be the first band from that scene to attract global interest with their mad splashy drums, intricate spurts of micro-percussion, lilting vocals crooning vaguely about Hyacinth Grrls, Cranes and Visi Rings and against-all-odds cohesive pulling together of a myriad disparate elements.  <strong>The buzz:</strong> \"The chaotic hurtle of noise-rock with the incandescent chime of highlife.\" <br> <strong>The truth:</strong> It's intriguing, it can be annoying, but when it works, and in small doses - too much is just too much - Abe Vigoda make an exhilarating noise.<br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Lubricate your living room. <br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Pay to have Vampire Weekend, ahem, \"removed\".<br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> Debut album Skeleton is released by Bella Union on October 6. <br> <strong>File next to:</strong> Vampire Weekend, Pavement, 23 Skidoo, Fire Engines. <br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"www.myspace.com/abevigoda\">MySpace.com/abevigoda</a><br> <strong>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> Anni Rossi.</p>",

  "<p>There must be rude people in China, and there must be grumpy people too, but I haven't met any in Beijing, and I've been here a week now. It's been a gruelling city to explore, as is any foreign metropolis. Beijing, though, seems especially difficult to navigate on foot, which is the best way to see any city. The arterial routes, ring roads and all, are too vast to wonder, all six lanes wide, and the side streets in-between too labyrinthine to do much other than get lost in.</p> <p>At first it felt like I was in a pinball table, replete with neon lights and steel and concrete buffers. I was bouncing around, zinging to and fro in taxis, listening to the radios' tiny delivery of either the state music or talk channels.</p> <p>And I loved it. In all my blundering, I've never shrugged the smile off my face. It's the people who live here that make it a great city, especially as the Olympics have brought out their best. Even in the most barren corners of town, and I've stumbled into a few construction sites and dead-end dumps, the passersby will smile, nod and stop to share the briefest of conversations.</p> <p>They have to be brief. The month or so of Mandarin studying I did before I came here has borne strange fruit. My teacher was the <a href=\"http://www.rosettastone.com/\">Rosetta Stone</a> (yes, I promised I'd give them a plug), a computer programme that is perfect if you want to try to master a language, but almost useless if you are slightly lazy and just in need of a few basic essentials. Other than the obvious everyday phrases, my Mandarin Chinese vocabulary is confined to such curious lines as \"no, I am not a doctor\", \"the horse is running\" and \"the fish is green\".</p> <p>I have the ability to make mundane but grammatically immaculate observations which either make me appear to be a gnomic idiot-savant or just a plain idiot. Probably the latter. I actually got to use the fish line at the Forbidden City today, staring into a pool of carp in the Imperial Gardens. And, just like every other encounter I've had here, the stranger smiled and laughed, asked where I was from and if I was here for the Games.</p> <p>There have been times when I've caught myself in situations so stupid only a wet-behind-the ears tourist could create them, such as when I asked a driver to take me to the drum tower (Gulou) and we spent 30 minutes driving in a square around the four Gulou expressways that surround the place I thought was our destination, the driver despairing at the fact I couldn't understand what I'd told him to do was the equivalent of circling the Wandsworth gyratory system. And in his frustration, his response - like everybody else's here - was to laugh at the comedy of it. I might be wrong, but I find it hard to imagine your average London cabbie would be as tolerant of a visiting tourist.</p> <p>Having finally conceded that going solo around Beijing wasn't working out, I hired an old gent to act as a guide around the Hutongs near Houhai Lake. I couldn't understand a word he said, but he seemed especially keen to point out the public WC system as we went. He spoke, I nodded, and we both laughed, neither of us really knowing why or what at.</p> <p>The smiles and conversations compensate for the unforgiving environment: the traffic constant, the clouds indistinguishable from the smog, most of the architecture bleakly modern. The citizens of Beijing seem to have found a way of coping with the habitat their government has created for them. That way seems to have a lot to do with laughter. An argument tends to last only as long as the moment in which it happens, forgotten as soon as it is over.</p> <p>Perversely for a culture that can be so colourful, vast swathes of the city are painted in uniform hues. The mazes of Hutong streets are gun-metal grey, just as the palaces and walls of the Forbidden City are deep terracotta. It is the people's personal decoration that provides the charm: the lanterns hung in the windows, the flags and plants that clutter the doorways.</p> <p>From what I've seen there is a definite coldness to the authorities' shepherding of the public at these Games, as stark as the steel fences that encircle the venues for hundreds of metres in all directions. The thousands of people thronging the streets to watch the fireworks of the opening ceremony were bluntly held back by lines of stony-faced policemen. It was frustrating, even for journalists. I bluffed my way to within a kilometre or so of the Bird's Nest using my pass, but could get no closer.</p> <p>Amazingly though, wherever the crowd was rebuffed, it would change flow and find another way along a path of lesser resistance to gain an extra few yards of proximity. I watched exhilarated as hundreds of people broke from the mass, sprinted across a huge highway and, despite the protests of officials, scaled the four-foot barrier between lanes and moved on over the road.</p> <p>It is the public on the streets who do most to make a stranger feel welcome, the officials here are all about no-smoking zones, security checks and no access. For all the billions of dollars, brilliant stadiums and absorbing sport, these Games would be rotten if the Beijing public weren't what they are: friendly and welcoming, tolerant but spirited.</p>",
  "<p>If you read the papers last week, you'd be forgiven for thinking that 1,500 people had gone to Kent for a pitched battle with the police. An organised and over-the-top campaign by the boys in blue focused on disrupting the <a href=\"http://www.climatecamp.org.uk\">camp for climate action</a> and flooding newsrooms with cliched shots of hippies versus coppers. It may have partially succeeded in diverting the media from climate change to policing, but it served to radicalise climate campaigners and bolster our determination to get our message across come what may.</p> <p>An early raid caught us off guard, as several hundred police stormed the site and <a href=\"http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2008/08/405943.html\">helped themselves</a> to whatever they could carry. Among the items taken \"to prevent criminal damage\" were crayons, board games, guy ropes for marquees, kitchen knives from the kitchens (still safely in their knife block), tools \u2013 wood saws, bolts and a spanner \u2013 roll mats, large water bottles and assorted equipment from the compost toilets.</p> <p>It couldn't have been clearer: under the auspices of checking for weapons the police made a naked attempt to shut the climate camp down. It backfired; as police moved to confiscate our plumbing supplies, <a href=\"http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2008/08/405125.html\">people resisted</a>, diving on lengths of pipe and refusing to let go. After a stand-off lasting nearly an hour, the cops left us to our piping and firewood to put out a triumphant press release.</p> <p>The constant presence and intentional disruption took its toll; workshops struggled on as people, exhausted from stress and lack of sleep, shouted to be heard over the rotors of a police chopper hovering overhead. We struggled into a bizarre routine: early morning wake-ups (\"Cops on site! Cops on site!\") and one memorable late-night charge accompanied by Ride of the Valkyries from an in-car stereo (which wasn't so much scary as displaying an amusing lack of imagination).</p> <p>But over time people toughened up and started to actively resist. When a line of riot police armed with shields, batons and pepper spray entered the site on Monday morning, they encountered several hundred people. Hands in the air, chanting \"<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/7540450.stm&quot;\">this is not a riot</a>\", they forced the police back to the rear gate (now dubbed \"the western front\" by journalists) and launched a three-day stand-off, bringing marquees, kitchens, toilets and a sound system to keep those holding the line entertained.</p> <p>The police bailed those arrested away from the camp so arrestees risked jail by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/05/kingsnorthclimatecamp.activists\">publicly breaching their bail conditions</a> and returning to the site. Bob Marshall-Andrews, the local MP, abandoned his holiday to return home and <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/7548684.stm\">condemn them</a> while Norman Baker narrowly avoided getting pepper-sprayed. Locals who braved Operation Oasis were amazed to discover, not terrorists or violence, but people building a sustainable way of life amidst massive state repression. Everyone laughed when a family from a nearby village started harassing a bunch of coppers, demanding that they pick on some real criminals.</p> <p>So was the police's operation successful? Despite hysterical reports and the most unlikely <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/a-sinister-weapons-cache-ndash-or-useful-camping-gear-886084.html\">weapons cache</a> ever \"found\" (couldn't they have planted a real throwing star, not a replica?) over 1,000 people made it to the power station for the day of action, with several hundred breaching the fences and four making it over the electric fence in a \"death or glory\" charge straight into the arms of waiting riot cops.</p> <p>Some 26 police forces ran amok, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/10/kingsnorthclimatecamp.activists&quot;\">threatening to charge</a> an authorised march with horses, dogs and long-handled batons. A flotilla of rafts bobbed along the Medway, defying an injunction and a local bylaw banning wate-borne processions until the police \"rescued\" them (a strange way to describe hijacking their safety boat and arresting its crew). We may not have stopped the power station running, but we sent a clear message to E:ON and the government: try to build Kingsnorth 2, and we'll shut you down.</p> <p>Of course, police taking a hard line with protesters is nothing new; we faced state repression since before the invention of the state. But climate change is not a wishy-washy liberal construct; it's backed up by hard science. We have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/01/climatechange.carbonemissions\">100 months</a> to stop runaway global warming, and scientists are now predicting temperature rises of 4 degrees or more in our lifetime. The police are paid to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/04/kingsnorthclimatecamp.climatechange\">protect capital and corporations</a>; once they see that their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/08/kingsnorthclimatecamp.climatechange\">children's lives</a> are at risk, will they start to change sides? If not, this week shows that we won't just stand by and let them protect those who would damn us to a future dominated by climate change, rising tides and resource exploitation. Whatever they throw at us, we can, will and must resist. The impact of our failure will be far more severe than anything the state can throw at us.</p>",
  "<p>Your historical ancestors are unlikely to have done anything remotely interesting. But your prehistorical ones almost certainly did. Like a form of deep genealogy, tracing our origins back thousands and millions of years is a branch of science that never fails to capture the public's imagination. </p> <p>At <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature\">Nature</a>, we often find that our most read, downloaded or listened to studies are those about our more ancient relatives, whether it's the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/apr/29/fossils.evolution3\">hobbit</a> of Flores or the oldest human ancestor, <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/ancestor/\">Toumai</a>. Last week, a paper in the journal <a href=\"http://www.cell.com/\">Cell</a> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/aug/08/evolution.genetics\">uncovered</a> the first completed sequence of the Neanderthal genome, and some fascinating insights into our evolutionary cousins. Expect more revelations from this project very soon. </p> <p>The demise of the Neanderthals is one of the great mysteries about the origin of our species. They were on a side branch in the human tree, co-existing with our direct ancestors for maybe 100,000 years. Their physical appearance has helped generate a bad rep, their being short, stocky and heavily browed. But these traits are only unattractive to us in the same way that a chimp might not fancy an orang-utan. </p> <p>Indeed, although it's been speculated about often, last week's paper suggests that there was probably very little interbreeding. The new data put the last common ancestor of Neanderthals and modern humans at around 660,000 years ago. That may seem like a long enough time without sex to be vastly different species, but in an evolutionary timescale it's the gap between a couple of one night stands. </p> <p>From fossils and more recently genetic analysis, in terms of behaviour, Neanderthals and humans share many characteristics. They weren't the knuckle-dragging grunters of fiction. It's well established that they ritually buried their dead, made tools and explored from the westernmost tip of Europe, well into Asia. They may have been capable of speech, as they had anatomical and <a href=\"http://anthropology.net/2007/10/18/neandertals-have-the-same-mutations-in-foxp2-the-language-gene-as-modern-humans/\">genetic</a> characteristics that are very similar to those that enable speech in us. There's even good genetic evidence that some Neanderthals had ginger hair and fair skin. </p> <p>So what brought about the fall of the house of Neander? Of the many theories, one stands out as being distinctly modern: genocide. </p> <p>Some lines of evidence suggest humans hunted their low-browed but smart cousins into oblivion. It's not difficult to argue that humans are an unusually aggressive species. Our desire to conquer, kill or forcibly impose our will upon others is probably culturally universal, and goes well beyond survival. We were almost certainly better toolmakers and better hunters than Neanderthals. We may have competed for the same resources and shelter. Wiping out this species would have been an easy job.</p> <p>But we should be careful about using evocative words like \"genocide\". It's tempting to speculate about this aggression in our ancestors as if it tells us something about our present. Genocide is a modern concept set in history rather than prehistory, such as in Rwanda where 100,000s of Tutsis were systematically murdered. To speculate about a Neanderthal genocide is wholly misleading. Neanderthals probably lived in very small groups and may have existed in global populations of as little as 10,000 at any one time. They may have been teetering on the brink of extinction for 1,000s of years. It looks as though the arrival of modern humans in their habitat speeded up their demise, but to invoke genocide suggests some sort of intentionality and strategic planning for which we simply have no evidence. More likely is that a combination of factors was at play, but basically, Neanderthals were the victim of that not cruel, but totally indifferent force of natural selection. </p> <p>What does learning about our evolutionary origin tell us about ourselves today? </p> <p>There are some things that we can understand: such as how western obesity is an artefact of our evolutionary past. Very recently and very quickly, our social development has led us to spend a lot of time eating cheeseburgers and mucking around on the internet. But our bodies are still stuck in a time when fatty and salty foods were hard to come by and therefore were sought out. Now, they are everywhere and our bodies can't cope. That's not to excuse unhealthy behaviour, merely to explain why it is unhealthy. </p> <p>It's the same fascination that renders paleoanthropology and genealogy so popular. The detective work in human evolution is a tad trickier, and the evidence less forthcoming. But, ultimately, the drive is the same: a curiosity about our past. Except that it's not really <em>our</em> past, and what both tell us about our own lives is limited. Genealogy is actually nosey micro-history. Aside from specific cases determined by heritable genetic diseases, the influence of each previous generation diminishes rapidly.</p> <p>Human evolution sits, rightly, as a branch of science that provokes genuine wonderment. It's actually my favourite subject. The Neanderthal genome project is truly a scientific and technological marvel. It will reveal many incredible things about an important species. But just as knowing something about who your great great great grandmother's brother married is finally a matter of idle curiosity, it won't tell us that much about ourselves now.</p>",
  "<p>Next April sees the demise of the Healthcare Commission, the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) and the Mental Health Act Commission (MHAC) \u2013 three inspectorates that have earned respect from patients and service users for their robust independence from government.</p> <p>The Healthcare Commission, for example, provided the public with hard evidence about which NHS trusts gave an excellent service and which fell below an acceptable standard. Its report last year on the Clostridium difficile outbreaks at Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells hospitals gave massive impetus to efforts to improve hygiene control across the NHS.</p> <p>But those three bodies will make way for the Care Quality Commission (CQC), chaired by Barbara Young. </p> <p>She was made a life peer in 1997 and took the Labour whip in the Lords until 2000, when she abandoned party affiliation on becoming chief executive of the Environment Agency, the job she has left to chair the commission.</p> <p>The first question in the minds of health and social care inspectors is how independent can Young be when her political colours have been nailed to the mast for so long.</p> <p>Young says: \"Yes, I am a Labour luvvy. Nobody would regard me as anything other than a Labour party member, lifelong.</p> <p>\"On the other hand, I have done zillions of jobs in the public sector. I have hung my political hat at the door and got on with the job.\"</p> <p>She says her appointment as a Labour peer surprised Conservative frontbenchers with whom she worked during 18 years as a health service manager until 1991 and subsequently for 17 years in organisations defending nature and the environment.</p> <p>She recalls that Conservative ministers Kenneth Clarke and John Gummer approached her soon after her elevation to say: \"Nobody told us you were Labour.\"</p> <p>The secret of working effectively in high-level jobs in the public sector, she says, is knowing how to separate personal political allegiance from a professional obligation to work with anybody who can help deliver results.</p> <p>During the last general election, the Healthcare Commission published damning findings about the poor state of maternity services at Northwick Park hospital. Could Young be as careless of the government's reputation during the next election campaign?</p> <p>She says: \"If you were to ask any current Labour politician whether I was capable of biting their arm off if need be, you would only get one answer. My track record of being independent is there for all to see. And that is irrespective of government \u2013 Labour, Conservative, whatever. I get the job done well and I don't trim my sails.\"</p> <p>She said her style of operation at the CQC would be \"to talk softly and carry a big stick.\"</p> <p>For most of the time, an inspectorate should work with the service providers, cajoling them towards better compliance with standards. \"Once in a blue moon, you have to take tough action because people are not taking you seriously or because they have been given a chance and have not risen to the challenge.\"</p> <p>She saw enforcement of standards as \"an escalating process.\" The CQC's new powers to fine providers or, if necessary, shut down services would not be used regularly. It would not \"go around spraying out enforcement notices\".</p> <p>Such an adversarial style would not drive up quality, Young says, adding bluntly: \"If they do muck around, we will come down on them like a ton of bricks.\"</p> <p>She was talking in sparsely staffed offices on the south bank of the river Thames in London where the CQC is in a formative stage. Its chief executive, Cynthia Bower, a former NHS strategic health authority chief, came aboard a fortnight ago, but other senior posts have yet to be filled.</p> <p>It is too early for Young to give precise answers about the compliance criteria that the CQC will use to monitor the providers. But she says: \"We have to be at least as tough as the Healthcare Commission. We don't want to be a 'care failures commission' that spots the laggards and biffs them. We want to be about improving standards as well as [maintaining] minimum standards.\"</p> <p>The CQC would be looking for \"early wins\" to show the benefits of integrating health and social care inspection. She says people have no idea when they move between services that they are regulated in different ways. NHS, local authority and independent sector services need to be more joined up and a single regulator is better placed to oversee the joins, she claims.</p> <p>The Healthcare Commission has taken a \"big brain\" approach to regulation, using intelligence systems to identify risks in the NHS and target inspections accordingly. </p> <p>The CSCI approach was more about \"running the finger around the toilet bowl.\" It had thousands of care homes to regulate and fewer statistical tools to identify where problems might lie. So, inevitably, it relied more on regularly visiting establishments. But CSCI had been developing a more risk-based approach to inspections.</p> <p>Young says there is now a need for an overarching view across health and social care about what can be achieved from information systems and what needs on-the-ground inspection.</p> <p>Young says she has an assurance from the government that the CQC will start life with the combined budget of its three predecessor organisations. But ministers also want it to carry out extra work and the commission would have to set its own priorities.</p> <p>Although its headquarters are in London, there will be a regional structure, as yet undefined.</p> <p>Would there be redundancies? Young says: \"The process of bringing together three commissions inevitably means some folk will not get jobs. The vast majority of people on the ground will transfer to us and will, in the immediate future, do pretty much what they are doing at the moment, probably in the same place. We are doing this fast. Most organisations do not complete a merger in only eight months.</p> <p>\"Among senior teams, we don't anticipate people leaving because of financial constraints. But if you are the head of a particular division, you might not want to hang around and be second in line [in a merged inspectorate].\"</p> <p>She is concerned that good people at every level may be leaving the service because of the prospect of merger upheaval. Her decision to be interviewed by the Guardian was influenced by a need to tell them that it was worth pitching their lot in with the CQC.</p> <p>Young's message to staff was: \"Panic not. We are going to be big and ambitious. There will be lots to do. We are going to be the best regulator in the world of health and social care.\"</p>",
  "<p>Boukpeti celebrates his bronze medal. Photograph: Tim Wimborne/Reuters</p> <p>Just when one story escapes, another arrives in its place. I'd come here hoping to see two British medals, instead I saw one, and something very special in place of the other. The whitewater arena at Shunyi rowing and canoeing park seats a staggering 40,000 people, a string of eight squat stands encircling the jagged-edged concrete basin through which the water flows at the rate of 17 cubic metres per second.</p> <p>That sounds fierce to a layman, and the competitors confirmed that the Chinese have constructed a ferociously difficult course. That much was obvious in the semi-finals of both the C1 and K1 (that's one-man canoe and one-man kayak in case you were curious), which cut the fields from 12 down to eight in both fields.</p> <p>The four to miss out in the kayaking included Campbell Walsh, the spry, wiry Scot who won silver in this event at Athens in 2004. Walsh, normally a fine technician, struggled for speed around the first half of the course, a victim perhaps of his own desire to \"play it safe\" in the semi and then take more risks in the final - the two times being combined to produce the crucial cumulative score. Walsh, struggling, clipped a post and incurred a two-second penalty, which was enough to put him last by a distance.</p> <p>Disconsolate, he can take solace not just in the silver he already has, but the fact that Peter Kauzer, the Slovenian world No2 and strong favourite was also eliminated. While Walsh disconsolately circled the warm-down pool after crossing the line, the furious Kauzer snapped his paddle across the bow of his boat and screamed in fury.</p> <p>The course, 280 metres of furious water in a tight channel, riddled with eddies and vortexes (allowing the baseball park-style American announcer Kent Ford to scream \"he's stuck in the vortex\" at the top his voice) was also too hard for the two-time Olympic gold medallist, Tony Estanguet. \"I don't know what it is\" Estanguet explained dolefully to an angry horde of French journalists, \"if I did I'd be in the final. Technically this is very different from other courses\".</p> <p>The entire sport seems implausibly difficult: the power and dexterity needed to sway body and boat around the poles and through the narrow gates is such an unlikely combination. The boats appear to be swept along like leaves in the current, only for the athletes to swing them around and cut back upstream, limbo-ing the poles. The degree of control the athletes exercise in such a savage environment is bafflingly impressive.</p> <p>Rarely more so than on David Florence's second run. Florence, born in Aberdeen, turned 26 on the day of the opening ceremony, which of course was held on the eighth of the eighth because it's a lucky number for the Chinese.</p> <p>After his first run he was sitting fourth overall, but his second was 88.15, quick enough to push him past Australia's Robin Bell into first. The next man out - Krysztof Bieryt, nearly capsized turning back through gate 16, while Satanislav Jezek clipped his third pole, meaning Florence was guaranteed silver.</p> <p>And that was what he finished with: Michal Martikan, who became Slovakia's first ever gold medal winner when he won this event in 1996 aged just 17, was master of the course. Despite clipping the 19th gate, he finished almost two seconds ahead in first. From the size of the grin he was wearing, you could tell Florence wasn't too unhappy about that.</p> <p>As exciting as it was for Florence, the crowd's affections were stolen by a Togolese named Benjamin Boukpeti in the K1. Even as the eliminated Walsh was finishing his run, roars of \"TO-GO! TO-GO!\" were coming from the stands.</p> <p>Boukpeti produced a blistering first run, stealing first place by just a hundredth of a second. The pressmen turned to each other, muttering \"who is this guy?\" and tapped his name into google. Togo have never won an Olympic medal, even though they've been in the Games since 1972.</p> <p>Boukpeti, 27, was one good run away from becoming a national hero. Born in Lagny, France, his father was Togolese but he now lives in Toulouse. Having finished 18th in the semi-final of this event in Athens, no one was even giving Boukpeti a sniff of a chance before the race, understandably given that his world ranking was a lowly 56th. He could have chosen to compete for France, but dislocated his shoulders when he was a teenager and slipped through their national system. Togo though, were glad to have him.</p> <p>With Germany's Alexander Grimm having set an exceptional time of 171.70, Boukpeti needed to make 85.62 on his second run to win. At the second split he was two hundredths of a second inside and the stadium was going nuts screaming in support. He lost time at the close, crossed the line in 173.45, enough to win a bronze that made him Togo's first ever Olympic medallist, a small but significant slice of history.</p> <p>He too snapped his paddle after finishing, only it was in pure joy rather than anger, the smile on his face too wide to measure. I'd love to see the front pages of the Togolese papers tomorrow morning.</p>",
  "<p>A leading al-Qaida military commander has been killed during several days of fierce fighting in north-west Pakistan, clashes that are pushing the country towards open war with the extremists. </p> <p>Insurgents blew up a bus carrying air force personnel today just outside Peshawar, the capital of the North West Frontier province. The powerful blast killed 14 people and injured 10 more, and left a five-metre crater in the road. </p> <p>According to a Pakistani security official, fighting in the Bajaur region has resulted in the death of militant Abu Saeed al-Masri, identified in local media reports as Mustafa Abu al-Yazid, al-Qaida's commander in Afghanistan. Yazid claimed responsibility for the bombing of the Danish embassy in Islamabad earlier this year, and he has also been linked to the assassination of the former prime minister Benazir Bhutto in December. </p> <p>A second key al-Qaida figure, Abu Khabab al-Masri - an alleged chemical and biological weapons expert - was killed last month in a US air strike in South Waziristan, another part of Pakistan's tribal area. The presence of Yazid and Masri in Pakistan will fuel claims that the Taliban insurrection in Afghanistan is being directed from Pakistani territory and that the country is being used by al-Qaida as its global operations centre. </p> <p>Bajaur is a hotbed of militancy, run by the Pakistani Taliban number two, Faqir Mohammed. It is thought to be a possible hiding place for al-Qaida's leaders, Ayman al-Zawahiri and Osama bin Laden. Yazid was an Egyptian who served time in jail with Zawahri after the assassination of the Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981. He has been referred to as al-Qaida's third most senior figure, rising up the ranks as other leaders have been killed. He succeeded Abu Ubaida al-Masri, who died of hepatitis, about a year ago. The September 11 Commission described Yazid as the network's \"chief financial manager\" and he may have wired money to the 9/11 hijackers. </p> <p>He recently gave a rare interview to Pakistan's Geo channel, in which he said that \"all Americans are our enemy now, not just the American government\". </p> <p>While attention in Islamabad is firmly fixed on the political drama surrounding the impeachment of President Pervez Musharraf, violence in north-west Pakistan is escalating, leaving the government's stated policy of holding peace talks with militants in tatters. </p> <p>Over the past week fighting has erupted in the Bajaur and Kurram areas along the Afghan border and in the Swat valley in North West Frontier province. </p> <p>In Kurram the fighting has an inter-tribal and sectarian nature that the Taliban is exploiting. The area has a significant Shia population that is threatened by the insurgents, who come from Islam's majority Sunnis. The violence has escalated in recent days but it has been ongoing for the last year. Tribesmen have repeatedly complained that the Pakistani security forces fail to come to their aid, and thousands of local people have fled the tribal territoryinto North West Frontier province (NWFP). </p> <p>Separately, the NWFP provincial parliament passed a near-unanimous vote in favour of impeaching President Musharraf today. The vote, by 107 to four, reveals a complete collapse in support for the president, with even the party led by his former interior minister, Aftab Sherpao, voting against him. The assembly in Punjab province also delivered an overwhelming vote against Mr Musharraf yesterday, in which many of his allies also deserted him. </p> <p>Sherry Rehman, the federal government's information minister, said she expected the impeachment resolution to be moved in the national parliament next week. \"A tidal wave is moving against General Musharraf,\" she said .</p>",
  "<p>House prices fell by 1.1% in the second quarter of this year, government figures showed today.</p> <p>Figures from the communities and local government department (DCLG) revealed that prices are falling, and at an accelerating rate. The 1.1% fall in the second quarter follows a fall of just 0.1% in the three months to the end of March. </p> <p>The drop means in the first half of the year around \u00a31,000 a month was knocked off the average price of a home in the UK, reducing it to \u00a3215,029 by the end of June.</p> <p>However, DCLG's figures for June show a 0.6% price rise year-on-year, in contrast with data from lenders <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/aug/08/houseprices.mortgages\">Halifax</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/aug/01/houseprices.property\">Nationwide </a>reported big price falls during the month.</p> <p>But the rate of growth has dropped off sharply since May, when annual price inflation was running at 3%, and has fallen by 4% since April.</p> <p>And the headline figure of growth across the UK in the year to June disguises price falls in Wales and Northern Ireland, where prices dropped. </p> <p>In Wales, annual price inflation of 0.8% in May turned to 1% deflation in June, while in Northern Ireland prices were down 9.4%, more than the 7.5% drop recorded in May.</p> <p>DCLG said prices had been driven down by a 3.6% fall in the average price of a flat and a 0.9% fall in the cost of a semi. But bungalows and detached houses have continued to rise in price, it said, increasing by 0.9% and 0.7% respectively. </p> <p>The housing market has been squeezed by reduced availability of mortgages and falling consumer confidence, and other major indexes have reported falling prices for several months. And recent speculation about changes to the stamp duty rules have also been blamed for deterring potential buyers.</p> <p>Last week, Halifax reported the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/aug/08/houseprices.mortgages\">first double-digit fall</a> in house prices since it began publishing its survey in the early 1980s, and said the downward trend looks set to continue as buyers stay out of the market.</p> <p>This morning surveyors reported a record low in activity, while mortgage lenders said loans taken out remained at historically low levels. </p> <p>Howard Archer, chief economist at Global Insight, said he expected housing market activity to remain subdued until the government made an announcement about stamp duty. </p> <p>\"Given the heightened expectations over such a move, the longer the government waits before making its plans known - one way or the other - the more housing market activity could be hit as people wait to see what will happen,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Any further slowdown in already very weak housing market activity would be liable to add to the downward pressure on prices.\"</p>",
  "<p>The fear that charitable donations would be an early victim of a collective tightening of belts in homes and boardrooms across the country was seemingly endorsed last month in a report by market research company NEMS.</p> <p>It found that 41% of the 500 households<a href=\"http://www.nemsmr.co.uk/foresight_article.aspx?ISS=7&amp;ART=1\"> surveyed </a> were already having problems balancing their expenses and 28% of those facing financial woes expected to donate less money to charity in the months to come. </p> <p>These are, admits Stephen Bubb, the chief executive of the Association of Charity Chief Executives, \"deeply worrying times\" for many voluntary sector leaders.</p> <p>Charities working with the millions of people in developing countries who are most vulnerable to rising global food and fuel prices, and domestic charities dealing with issues such as homelessness and debt relief are likely to see the demand for their services increase as their income stalls.</p> <p>Oxfam, one of the UK's largest fundraising charities, said this week it aimed to slash 10-15% off its costs in the next financial year. It insisted this move would occur as part of \"our normal business cycle\", but the charity acknowledged \"the new economic reality will also have implications for Oxfam's work and resources\".</p> <p>But just how worried should charities be? Despite the portents of doom, many charities haven't been hit where it hurts just yet. Recent research by voluntary sector thinktank <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/jul/09/charities.creditcrunch\">Nfpsynergy</a> claimed there was an average 17-month delay before a drop in GDP affected charities' total income, including government grants and direct debits.</p> <p>That is more than enough time, the thinktank's director Joe Saxton concludes, for charities to \"tighten their ship\" before the predicted recession really hits.</p> <p>Saxton believes the credit crunch could all too easily become a convenient excuse for those charities wanting to pin the blame for weak and faltering fundraising strategies on larger external forces.</p> <p>\"Just watch how many charities start writing phrases like \"we are facing difficult and unpredictable times\" into their fundraising reviews,\" he says. \"To me that is just another way of saying we're not responsible for any of the financial problems we're facing, when the truth is that those charities who have built strong predictable income streams and robust financial planning mechanisms in place will be able to weather the storm.\"</p> <p>One thing is for sure. If the economic downturn is really going to be as bad as everyone thinks it will be, then charities must ensure they are ready to deal with what is ahead.</p>",
  "<p>Flood warnings are in place across the UK after heavy downpours soaked many regions of the country early this morning.</p> <p>The Environment Agency issued eight flood alerts as torrential rain hit Wales, Northern Ireland, the Midlands, East Anglia and London.</p> <p>Forecasters said 10mm of rain fell in one hour in London this morning. More than 20mm of rain was recorded in Devon and Cornwall overnight.</p> <p>The heaviest rain was in Wales, with Cambridgeshire, Leicestershire and Suffolk also experiencing dramatic weather.</p> <p>Barry Gromett from the Met Office said the rain was caused by a low pressure system and active fronts moving very quickly north.</p> <p>''You don't expect to see such active weather systems in August,'' he said. \"It is a very unsettled picture. There will be showers throughout the day and heavy thunderstorms.''</p> <p>A severe weather warning for Northern Ireland was issued, with up to 50mm of rain expected overnight.</p> <p>Police warned of flooding on roads, including on the main A1 Belfast-Dublin Road at Banbridge, Co Down.</p> <p>Campers were rescued from the Mourne mountains this morning after their pitch was washed out by torrential rain.</p> <p>The three teenage girls called the Mourne rescue team after finding their route down from the mountains blocked by a swollen river.</p> <p>Ed Kilgore, the chairman of the Mourne rescue service, said: \"A group had been out camping and were woken by the rain at around 5am and found their camp washed out.</p> <p>\"When they tried to make their way back down the way they had gone up, they found their way blocked by a river that was so badly swollen they could not get across.\"</p> <p>Forecasters predicted the heavy rain would move north into East Anglia and be replaced by showers and patches of sunshine tomorrow.

  "<p>Despite <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/12/inflation.creditcrunch\">today's surge in inflation to 4.4%</a>, <strong>George Buckley</strong> at <strong>Deutsche Bank</strong> said that the Bank of England is unlikely to raise interest rates to tackle the rising cost of living, having left them unchanged last week.</p> <p>\"Importantly, the monetary policy committee would have known these figures at the time of their August meeting - and they did not of course raise rates. However, today's strong reading makes a hawkish Inflation Report and minutes possible,\" said Buckley, looking ahead to the Quarterly Inflation Report which the Bank will release tomorrow.</p> <p><strong>Ross Walker</strong> at <strong>RBS</strong> said that the rise in the consumer prices index, to an 11-year high, meant little hope of a reduction in the cost of borrowing.<br>\"To some extent it's old news as the market is braced for 5% by the autumn. But it's certainly not helpful. The window is closing for the Bank of England to raise rates but it will make it harder for an early cut.\"</p> <p><strong>Vicky Redwood</strong> at <strong>Capital Economics </strong>pointed out that yesterday's producer price inflation data showed that input cost pressures are easing, suggesting there will be fewer risks to drive inflation higher in the future.</p> <p><strong>Philip Shaw</strong> at <strong>Investec</strong> also doubted that interest rates will be pushed above their current level of 5% soon. \"It's nothing new but it's very disappointing data with widespread signs of higher price pressures. It will undoubtedly convince some members of the monetary policy committee to vote for higher rates but we doubt they will reach a majority.\"</p> <p><strong>Howard Archer</strong> at <strong>Global Insight</strong> said: \"This is a really disturbing set of data that will not go down at all well at the Bank of England. The sharp spike up in inflation in July increases the risk that the Bank of England will raise interest rates despite the fact that the economy seems more likely than not to contract over the second half of the year.\"</p> <p>But Archer added that weaker economic activity should increasingly dampen inflationary pressures and help bring it back down without needing to raise borrowing costs.</p>",
  "<p>The lawyer who was threatened by terrorists whilst acting for Salman Rushdie has said that Random House US should pay \"substantial compensation\" to Sherry Jones, whose novel about Muhammad's child bride Aisha was dropped by the publisher over fears it could provoke terrorist attacks. Jones's The Jewel of Medina was described as potentially more controversial than both Rushdie's novel The Satanic Verses and the Danish newspaper cartoons of Muhammad. </p> <p>Geoffrey Robertson QC, whose latest book The Tyrannicide Brief is published by Random House US and who was under terrorist threat whilst acting for Rushdie, said: \"We can't be overcritical of American publishers for cowering under terrorist threats. After all, the Guardian, like every other British newspaper, lacked the gumption to publish the Danish cartoons. But all who care about free speech have a duty to make this sort of censorship counterproductive. Random House should pay this author substantial compensation, and the book should be placed on a website so everyone can read it.\" </p> <p>The Jewel of Medina was due to be published by Random House US on August 12, but the publisher dropped the book after consultations with academics and security experts suggested that it \"might be offensive to some in the Muslim community, but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small, radical segment\". The move has provoked a storm of controversy across the internet, with some bloggers calling on readers to boycott Random House, and others criticising Jones for \"insulting the Prophet\".</p> <p>In a statement, Random House said: \"We stand firmly by our responsibility to support our authors and the free discussion of ideas, even those that may be construed as offensive by some. However, a publisher must weigh that responsibility against others that it also bears, and in this instance we decided, after much deliberation, to postpone publication for the safety of the author, employees of Random House Inc, booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the book.\" When Rushdie's The Satanic Verses was published in 1988, attempts were made on the lives of his Norwegian and Italian publishers, and the Japanese translator of the novel was killed. </p> <p>Jones said she did not believe there was any risk involved in publishing the book. \"Frankly I'm more afraid of global warming than of terrorist attacks,\" she said. \"I did expect my book would be controversial, just because I'm a pink woman writing about a culture that was not my own and a religion that is not my own \u2026 [but] my aim was not to provoke, it was to portray the difficulty of being a woman in that era, and to portray this wonderful heroine who overcame obstacles to become a prominent figure in Islam.\" </p> <p>The first person narrative details the life of Aisha, one of Muhammad's wives, from the age of six until 18 when Muhammad dies. Aisha is portrayed as a spirited young woman, distressed by being put into purdah aged six, and keen to be treated as equal to men. \"I pulled myself up to my windowsill and peered into the stars, imagining they were the one thousand and one eyes of al-Lah. When He looked at me, what did He see? Inferiority, a shrunken soul, a light that shone more feebly than that of a man? Or did He see what I felt - a bright burning, like the bush He'd inhabited the day He'd revealed Himself to Moses?\" </p> <p>Jones skirts around the edges of Aisha's sexual relationship with Muhammad without going into graphic details. \"This was the beginning of something new, something terrible. Soon I would be lying on my bed beneath him, squashed like a scarab beetle, flailing and sobbing while he slammed himself against me. He would not want to hurt me, but how could he help it? It's always painful the first time.\" The author compared the novel, which was described as \"soft core pornography\" by one academic, to works such as Anita Diamant's The Red Tent, which retells the story of the rape of Dinah from Genesis chapter 34. \"My portrayal of Muhammad is extremely respectful, and of the origins of Islam is very accurate and respectful,\" she said. \"Muhammad says in the Koran that he was a mortal. I assume he did all the things a man does. He had 12 wives \u2013 I'm sure he had sex with them.\" </p> <p>She said she was hopeful of finding a new publisher shortly. \"I'm glad the story has come out because now any publisher who takes it on will do so with eyes wide open. I'm hoping to find someone who is as passionate as I am and my agent is.\" </p> <p>Publisher Andrew Franklin, director of Profile Books, said that Random House should not have been deterred from publishing by imagined threats of Islamic extremism. \"It's absolutely shocking. They are such cowards,\" he said. Franklin pointed to Penguin's publication of The Satanic Verses in 1988. \"I think Penguin acted with great integrity,\" said Franklin, who was working for Penguin at the time. \"They behaved as any publisher in the west should do, and upheld freedom of publication and freedom of speech. They stuck by their guns at not inconsiderable risk to their senior executives. These are the principles we should live and die by.\"</p>",

In a separate deal, Tesco has signed Tata up as a consultant to help expand the Star Bazaar chain from four hypermarkets in India today to 50 stores over the next five years.</p> <p>The deals will \"enable the two companies to benefit from the rapid development of a modern supply chain\", Tesco said this morning.</p> <p>Based initially in Mumbai, the cash-and-carry chain is the latest in a series of ventures by Tesco, which expects to spend up to \u00a360m in the first two years. In May, the world's third largest retailer agreed to buy 36 stores in South Korea for $1.9bn (\u00a3996m) and last month it unveiled plans to move into banking. It already operates across Europe and has 814 shops across Asia plus the Fresh &amp; Easy stores in the US, which were launced last October.</p> <p>\"This is another exciting development for Tesco,\" said Sir Terry Leahy, chief executive. \"It complements our entries into China and the US, giving us access to another of the most important economies in the world. </p> <p>Tesco already sources more than \u00a3170m worth of products from India each year and has sourcing offices in Delhi, Bangalore and Tirupur. The supermarket employs nearly 3,000 staff at its service centre in Bangalore, which provides IT and financial services to the Tesco group. The new venture will see more staff recruited although the number is not yet known. </p> <p>Tesco said that under the terms of the agreement with Trent, Tata's retail arm, the Indian firm will be able to draw on Tesco's extensive retail expertise.</p> <p>Today's announcement is the group's first foray into the Indian market. Leahy has said in the past that India is at the top of its list for global expansion.

If anyone in Georgia is in a position to let us know, please do. </p> <p><strong>12noon</strong></p> <p><strong>Veronica Khokhlova</strong>, <a href=\"http://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/08/12/georgia-russia-tbilisi-reports/\">writing on Global Voices</a>, translates some blog posts written by people in Tbilsi as Russian forces advanced overnight.</p> <blockquote> <p>I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow morning. Maybe tanks will enter the city. Mishka is asleep, my little boy. He kept turning around, asking: 'They aren't bombing Batumi, are they?' He misses his brother. I shouldn't have told him yesterday. Though this way he is prepared, at least. All hope for Sarkozy, maybe he'll convince them - but this is unlikely too, no one is going to back out at this point - they'll be eating us hot.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>12.30pm</strong></p> <p>Alan Kochiev, a South Ossetian nationalist, has been blogging about the fighting in Tskhinvali. His version of events, via Google Translate, are <a href=\"http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Frupor-naroda.livejournal.com%2F&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;sl=ru&amp;tl=en\">here</a>.</p> <p>London's Evening Standard has a more considered <a href=\"http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23531043-details/%27Like+at+Stalingrad%2C+we+must+fight+for+every+house+in+this+town%27/article.do\">translation</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Tskhinvali is ours. We raided a warehouse for guns and Russian troops have finally arrived and cordoned off the entire town. The Georgians are knocked out. We are taking up positions throughout the town and will defend it. There are lots of dead people around. A captive Georgian tank mechanic said only 100 out of their 500 tankmen survived yesterday. The guys took over a tank, placed the captive at the steering control and went shooting at the Georgians. The captive fought as long as he could.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>12.55pm</strong></p> <p>From the Reuters high priority wire:</p> <blockquote> <p>GEORGIA SAYS RUSSIAN JETS BOMBING VILLAGES IN GEORGIA</p> </blockquote> <p>(Reuters' caps not mine) </p> <p><strong>1.25pm</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdhGehY3ff8&amp;eurl=http://www.blogsofwar.com/2008/08/12/russian-president-dmitry-medvedev-ends-military-operation-in-georgia/\">Here's</a> a YouTube item of the Russian president announcing the end of his troops' advance.

The vehicles included tanks, armoured personnel carriers and three pieces of artillery. The northern part of the Kodori Gorge is the only part of the separatist region of Abkhazia still held by Georgian forces, who have come under attack in recent days. </p> <p><strong>2.30pm</strong></p> <p>The indefatigable Saakashavili is giving another press conference. He accuses Russian troops of ethnic cleansing in Abkhazia and expresses regret for the death of a Dutch journalist, apparently killed by a cluster bomb. He says the Russians are going after police stations in Georgia in an attempt to sow disorder as a part of a deliberate strategy to undermine the country's authority.</p> <p><strong>2.35pm</strong></p> <p>Saakshavili reiterates his message of defiance. \"No matter how much they want to undermine us... we will never surrender.\"</p> <p><strong>2.40pm</strong></p> <p>Russia may be coming under international condemnation, but its actions in Georgia are popular at home. According to a survey by independent pollsters Levada, almost half of Russians want South Ossetia to become part of Russia. Forty six per cent of respondents told Levada they wanted to see South Ossetia as part of Russia. Only four percent said it should remain part of Georgia. </p> <p>That's not how Nato sees it. Nato's secretary-general, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, told a news conference that the clock should be turned back. \"It is very important that all parties go back to the status quo ante, that is as it existed on August 6.\"</p> <p>De Hoop Scheffer also says that Nato stands by its commitment made at the Bucharest summit that Georgia will one day become a Nato member. Georgia's Nato aspirations have not gone down well with the Kremlin, which sees the arrival of a military alliance on its doorstep as a threat.</p> <p><strong>3.20pm</strong></p> <p>The French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, is giving a press conference following his meeting with his Russian counterpart.</p> <blockquote> <p>We have had free and frank discussions.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>3.25pm</strong></p> <p>Sarkozy continues:</p> <blockquote> <p>There is a Russian commitment to respect the sovereignty of Georgia... We are not at peace yet but we are at a stage of a temporary cessation of hostilities. We want the best possible result but there is a lot of work to do yet.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>3.30pm</strong></p> <p>There is now a Q&amp;A session going on with journalists. Sarkozy, who doesn't seem to be the sort of person to use 10 words when he can use 100, somewhat tortuously suggests that he hasn't been able to sort out all the Caucasus' problems in one day.</p> <p>Asked about Russia's attitude to Georgia's territorial integrity, Medvedev says:</p> <blockquote> <p>Territorial integrity is a complicated matter that cannot be solved in summits. It is up to people in Georgia, South Ossetia and Abkhazia to decide whether they want to live in the same state. That is a question they should be asked and they will answer unambiguously.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>To a question from the Russian media about Russian reaction, Medvedev says his country was faced with Georgian aggression and reacted in the only way possible.</p> <p><strong>4.10pm</strong></p> <p>Getty photographers have been filing images following <a href=\"http://www.gettyimages.com/Search/Search.aspx?contractUrl=2&amp;language=en-US&amp;family=editorial&amp;assetType=image&amp;p=gori&amp;src=standard\">fighting in Gori</a> and <a href=\"http://www.gettyimages.com/Search/Search.aspx?contractUrl=2&amp;language=en-US&amp;family=editorial&amp;assetType=image&amp;p=tskhinvali&amp;src=standard\">Tskhinvali</a>.</p> <p><strong>5pm</strong></p> <p>The following are, according to Reuters, what Medvedev said were the key elements of the peace plan:</p> <p>1) Agreement on the non-use of force.</p> <p>2) Cessation of all military action.</p> <p>3) Free access to humanitarian aid.</p> <p>4) Georgian military to return to their permanent bases.</p> <p>5) Russian military to return to the positions held before the current hostilities.

  "<p><strong>Scroll down for updates</strong></p> <p>With Gordon Brown still on holiday in Scotland, David Cameron is doing his best to seize the initiative. </p> <p>He was on the World at One yesterday with some very robust, gung-ho language about Russia, and he managed to ensure that when Brown's own statement on the crisis was released a couple of hours later, it sounded rather lame. (Although Cameron has the luxury of not having to deal with these people at the moment and, like all western politicians talking tough, he was very vague as to what sanctions he would actually use against the Russians in practice.)</p> <p>He will probably get asked about that this morning. </p> <p>It's started. Cameron is making a statement about the Georgian conflict. He says it looks as if Russia is trying to topple the Georgian regime, and as if it is trying to send a message to Ukraine and the central Asian states to the effect that they cannot afford to defy Moscow.</p> <p>He says the government must take various measures. Has the government summoned the Russian ambassador? Has the government proposed an urgent meeting of Nato foreign ministers? Is the government considering visa changes for Russian citizens? Is it considering calling for Russia to be suspended from the G8?</p> <p>He says that if Russia is allowed to get away with this, they will try similar tactics against other countries.</p> <p>He repeats the line he used yesterday: \"The only language bullies understand is when you face up to them.\"</p> <p>He is moving on to domestic concerns, and the economy.</p> <p>Today's inflation figures are very worrying for people trying to make ends meet, he says. But the government cannot wave a magic wand. </p> <p>On fuel prices, the Tories are considering flexible duty rates.</p> <p>On business, the Tories are looking at changes to insolvency laws.</p> <p><strong>10.30am</strong></p> <p>The government's decision to brief about the possibility of a stamp duty holiday was \"reckless\". It has frozen up the housing market.</p> <p>Cameron says he will be meeting the National Association of Estate Agents this afternoon. The association has asked three times to meet the chancellor, Alistair Darling, but he has refused to see them.</p> <p>The Conservatives are holding a seminar on housing. It will consider policies to free up the market, policies to prevent people having their homes prepossessed and measures that could stop the problem recurring. But the party won't be announcing policies.</p> <p>Then he invites questions.</p> <p><strong>Stamp duty</strong></p> <p>Vicky Young from the BBC asks if Cameron thinks abolishing stamp duty for first-time buyers (the Tory policy) is responsible at a time when young people should not be encouraged to buy into the housing market.</p> <p>Cameron does not accept this. He says stamp duty is an issue for first-time buyers. But his plan will not rescue the housing market on its own.</p> <p><strong>Russia</strong></p> <p>Niall Patterson from Sky News asks if Cameron is accusing the government of inaction.</p> <p>Cameron says the government must engage with the issues. There are a series of things the government could do that would send \"a very clear message\" that what the Russians did was unacceptable.</p> <p>Because the Georgian strategy was \"misguided\", some people are unclear as to who is to blame.</p> <p>But Cameron says he is clear that Russia is in the wrong.</p> <p><strong>The next election</strong></p> <p>Graeme Wilson from the Sun asks if Cameron agrees with William Hague when he said last week that the Tories were the \"likely winners\" of the next election.</p> <p>Cameron says he does not use those words. \"There is no complacency\". There is a \"huge difference\" between people saying they want another government and people actually voting for his party at a general election.</p> <p>The Tories still have a \"long way to go\". There will be \"no smugness, no complacency\".</p> <p><strong>10.35am</strong></p> <p><strong>Green taxes/the Glasgow East \"fat\" speech/Preparing for government</strong></p> <p>James Lyons from the Mirror asks about three question in one go. It's probably a record.</p> <p>Asked about the session at the autumn conference called \"preparing for government\", Cameron says that is sensible planning. He says there was a session at the spring conference on preparing for government too. It does not mean he's being complacent.</p> <p>On green taxes, he says green taxes will be offset by tax cuts elsewhere.</p> <p>On the Glasgow speech, in which he said sometimes people were to blame for being fat, he says he stands by it.</p> <p>Lyons asked if he had discussed it with Eric Pickles (the local government spokesman, who is on the large side). Cameron does not comment on Pckles's girth directly, but he says that all members of the shadow cabinet supported it.</p> <p><strong>Georgia/David Miliband</strong></p> <p>Michael White from the Guardian asks about Georgia, and also whether Cameron agrees with Hague's verdict in the interview last week that David Miliband is a bit of a \"geek\".</p> <p>Cameron won't be drawn on Miliband. He claims not to know very much about who is or isn't a geek.</p> <p>On Georgia, he says it would be \"very dangerous\" to allow Russia to intervene in Georgia because of the interests of Russians living in South Ossetia.</p> <p>Mike says the Russians could be seen as having a legitimate interest in what happens in South Ossetia. (I haven't really done justice to his point, but <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/politics/2008/08/michael_whites_political_blog_220.html\">he blogged on this yesterday</a>.)</p> <p>Cameron says there is a difference between having a legitimate interest and invading.</p> <p><strong>Labour leadership</strong></p> <p>Would Cameron like to see Gordon Brown stay in post?</p> <p>Cameron says he has always used the line that it is hard enough to run your own party, without trying to talk about what should be happening in others. He says he has \"no idea\" what will happen within Labour</p> <p><strong>Repossessions</strong></p> <p>Jean Eaglesham from the FT asks if Cameron is in favour of statutory measures to prevent unnecessary home repossessions.</p> <p>Cameron says that is exactly the kind of issue that the party will be discussing at its housing seminar today.</p> <p><strong>10.45am</strong></p> <p>We're going to have to leave it there, I'm afraid, because I'm monitoring it from the TV and the live broadcasts have all dried up.</p> <p><strong>Summary</strong></p> <p><strong>Russia:</strong> More tough talk about Moscow. Cameron even answered my point about \"what would he do?\" with a short list of measures the government could be implementing, or at least considering. His words do leave the official Foreign Office/Downing Street response looking a bit feeble. </p> <p>In the scheme of things this probably did not amount to very much - comments that Brown and Cameron issued yesterday did not get much coverage in the papers today, as far as I could see - but it must be reassuring for the Tories to \"beat\" the government within the news cycle.</p> <p><strong>Housing:</strong> Again, Cameron scored another, easy hit. He criticised the government for damaging the housing market by briefing newspapers last week about the possibility of a stamp duty holiday and he revealed that the Tories are holding a seminar on the subject today. He has not got any policies to announce, but at least the Tories look concerned.</p> <p><strong>The Labour leadership situation:</strong> It's easy to imagine Cameron having something to say about this. He could have taunted Miliband for not standing against Brown, or praised him lavishly. But he chose to stay out of it.</p> <p><strong>That sun tan:</strong> Did you see it? I'm not quite sure how anyone gets a tan that good from a fortnight in Devon, but he certainly looks like a man who's had a good holiday.</p> <p>More politics news comment and analysis at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics\">theguardian.com/politics</a></p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/ubs\">UBS</a> has underlined its status as one of the biggest losers in the credit crunch by announcing \u00a35.1bn of fresh writedowns and its fourth quarterly loss in a row.</p> <p>The Swiss bank said this morning that it made a net loss of 358m Swiss francs (\u00a3173m) in the second quarter of this year. The loss was caused by its continuing exposure to the US housing market, and a huge outflow of funds as wealthy individuals took their money elsewhere.</p> <p>The new writedowns push UBS's total since the crisis started to $42bn, bringing it closer to Citigroup ($47bn) and Merrill Lynch ($46bn).</p> <p>The damage caused by the ongoing sub-prime crisis also appears to have spread beyond UBS's investment bank to other divisions, with a total of SFr43.8bn leaving the business, leaving it with SFr2.7 trillion under management. </p> <p>UBS also said it had set aside $900m to cover the cost of settling legal action brought by US investors who claimed they were wrongly sold auction-rate securities before the market collapsed.</p> <p>Although the bank cut its operating costs by 18% in the quarter, partly by slashing thousands of jobs, it does not expect to see an upturn soon. Instead it issued a grim warning that the rest of 2008 will be just as tough as the last six months</p> <p>\"The positive sentiment seen at the end of first quarter 2008 that the credit crisis may be easing was short-lived, as trading conditions deteriorated significantly in the second half of May, in particular for assets related to US residential real estate as well as other structured credit positions,\" said UBS, in a sign that the credit crunch still has some way to run.</p> <p>Shares in the bank fell by 3% in early trading.</p> <p>In an attempt to recover its fortunes, UBS is splitting its private banking, investment banking and asset management arms into three separate divisions. </p> <p>Its global asset management arm saw a net reduction of SFr24.5bn in funds under management to SFr757bn, while its wealth management business suffered outflows of SFr17.3bn. Another SFr2bn moved out of the Swiss business banking operation. Analysts said this was a sign that UBS's reputation has suffered serious damage, following its massive loss of SFr11.5bn in the first quarter of this year and the departure of chairman Marcel Ospel.</p> <p>It has also appointed a British accountant, John Cryan, as its new chief financial officer. He currently runs the financial institutions division within its investment bank.</p> <p>Last week, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/09/ubs.scamsandfraud\">UBS agreed to pay a fine of up to $150m</a> and reimburse customers to the tune of nearly $19bn (\u00a310bn) to compensate for the alleged mis-sale of auction-rate securities. This deal was hammered out with US regulators, who investigated claims that investment banks acted wrongly by encouraging customers to buy the securities, which are currently almost unsellable.</p> <p>The $900m UBS has set aside to cover the costs of this settlement reflect the fact that the securities market will eventually , allowing the financial instruments to be sold again.</p>"
