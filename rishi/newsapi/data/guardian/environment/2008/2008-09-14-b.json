  "<p>The Times once called Ellen Terry \"the uncrowned queen of England\". She was racy for a royal, though. The child bride of artist GF Watts, she ran off with a friend of Oscar Wilde at 21, had two illegitimate children and fell for unsuitable man after unsuitable man. Her glory came on the stage, where she had a legendary partnership with Henry Irving. At the Lyceum in London, they created a grand \"cathedral of the arts\", and first nights of their Shakespearean melodramas were a must in every toff and toffess's social calendar. Eleanor Bron is reading Michael Holroyd's biography of the pair, A Strange Eventful History, for <strong>Book of the Week </strong>(9.45am, Radio 4 and repeated), alongside recordings of their performances.</p> <p>Evan Davis, meanwhile, is marking a year since the Northern Rock crisis by taking banking experts to the 22nd floor of a London skyscraper and ... pushing them out the window? Shame on you! No, they'll be debating the motion: \"This economic crisis is a good opportunity to rebuild the global order.\" That's <strong>The Credit Crunch Mess: What Next? </strong>(8pm, Radio 4).</p>",
  "<p>About \u00a31bn in western aid to revive Zimbabwe's economy will hang in the balance today as western donors watch to see how a power-sharing deal to be signed by President Robert Mugabe works in practice before committing a rescue package.</p> <p>Under the deal with his arch-rival Morgan Tsvangirai, Mugabe is to surrender many of his powers for the first time in 28 years. But though the agreement, to be formally signed today, marks a huge climbdown by Mugabe, foreign donors indicated that they want to see just how much power Tsvangirai wields as the new prime minister in the coalition government.</p> <p>\"We want to see this government in action before we commit our support to it,\" said a European diplomat in Harare. \"We need to see Mugabe is not continuing to run things. There will be benchmarks, litmus tests of who's really in charge.\"</p> <p>Donors, including Britain, the EU and the US, are broadly agreed to inject about \u00a31bn in aid over a year to reverse more than a decade of economic decline that has brought inflation above 20,000,000%, mass unemployment, empty supermarket shelves and forced about 4 million people to leave the country to find work. </p> <p>Agriculture has collapsed, leaving millions without sufficient food and reducing many to one meal every other day.</p> <p>Tsvangirai will be keen to see the foreign money as soon as possible in the hope of bolstering public support by swiftly moving to alleviate people's misery. </p> <p>The power-sharing agreement brokered by the South African president, Thabo Mbeki, gives the opposition a majority of one in the cabinet and places Tsvangirai in charge of the daily administration of government. </p> <p>When the 31 cabinet posts are divided in the coming days, Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change is likely to win control of the finance ministry because Mugabe recognises the donors will not want to see a Zanu-PF minister in charge of their funds. But diplomats say that their governments will be looking for other signs that Tsvangirai is in control. </p> <p>One test will be if the MDC gains authority over the police and if it is able to remove the highly partisan police commissioner, Augustine Chihuri, who said he would not salute Tsvangirai if he were elected president and whose force played an active part in the bloody assault on opposition supporters during the election. </p> <p>Western donors are also keen to see the governor of the central bank, Gideon Gono, sacked because of his alleged role in the plunder of the country's hard currency reserves and fuelling inflation by furiously printing money.</p> <p>Nonetheless it will be difficult for western countries to turn their back on today's watershed agreement because they risk being accused of failing to accept an African-mediated settlement. The evident hostility and suspicion with which Mugabe regards Tsvangirai and the expectations of western governments was evident in a column in the state-run Herald newspaper by the president's spokesman, George Chiramba, under a pseudonym. It called the MDC in government the \"enemy within\" and accused it of taking its orders from Britain and other powers.</p> <p>\"For a party that has always relied on government and intellect for policy incubation, [Zanu-PF] has to learn to govern in a new environment where the enemy is within, well embedded,\" Chiramba wrote. \"The west will now have an eager listening post, right up to cabinet. There will be lots of policy pre-emption.\"</p> <p>Many Zimbabweans are cautious about the political settlement. Lining up for bread in shops with otherwise bare shelves, or queuing for the pitiful 50p-worth of currency they are permitted to withdraw from the bank each day, people are desperate for reasons to hope.</p> <p>However, men such as Arthur Mubaiwa, who was part of a very long queue for petrol yesterday, say they know Mugabe and they do not have full confidence in Tsvangirai.</p>",
  "<p>Europe's first state-funded school for Hindus, which receives its spiritual guidance from the Hare Krishna movement, opens today in London amid continued concern about the divisive nature of faith schools.</p> <p>Krishna-Avanti primary school, in the north-west borough of Harrow, home to about a quarter of the UK's Hindu population, is welcoming 30 children to its temporary base at Little Stanmore primary school. The school will gradually increase in size until 2014, when it will have filled places for 236 pupils, including a nursery. </p> <p>However, pupils will have to wait until next September to enjoy their new \u00a310m building, which will have a meditation garden, an amphitheatre for outside teaching and eco-friendly innovations such as a grass roof. </p> <p>Headteacher Naina Parmar said it was a \"huge step forward for Britain's 1 million Hindus\" before adding: \"I want our school to be a haven of peace. Hinduism is a very inclusive faith, which naturally promotes a calm, caring and cooperative learning environment. </p> <p>\"This will be reflected not only in the curriculum but also in the school's ethos and environment.\"</p> <p>The opening coincides with renewed calls for a reform of the government's policy on faith schools. Members of Accord, a coalition of religious and non-religious groups and individuals, warned that faith schools could have a negative impact on children. </p> <p>Its chair, Rabbi Dr Jonathan Romain, said: \"Some parents will feel reassured by a school that shares their faith and cultural background, but everybody should also be aware of the impact this may have - limiting their children's knowledge of and interaction with children from other cultures, and also depriving other community schools of Hindu participation.\"</p> <p>He urged the school to teach pupils about other traditions and to follow the local religious education syllabus. He said it was also vital the school did not discriminate against non-Hindus when employing staff or bar children of other faiths from attending.</p> <p>Nitesh Gor, chair of governors at Krishna-Avanti, rejected suggestions that the school would foster segregation and insularity. \"Faith schools have an excellent record of providing high-quality education. </p> <p>\"By helping children to develop strong self-identities, the best faith schools also give children the confidence to play a full part in the wider community.\"</p>",

  "<p>When Richard Sambrook became director of BBC Global News four years ago, many believed he was being unfairly sidelined because of his involvement in the events that led to the Hutton report. But he has always maintained that the global news job was the only one he wanted as it would be at the heart of changes at the corporation and at the cutting edge of a revolution in its news journalism. Recent events suggest that he may have been right all along. </p> <p>Currently somewhere between Los Angeles and New York, the BBC's US08 Election bus is an embodiment of the dizzying pace of change at its global news operations. Travelling from coast to coast, reporters, presenters and analysts will file to BBC World Service English, 12 World Service language channels, BBC World News, BBC News service back home, BBC Arabic TV, Radio 1 and Radio 5 Live. </p> <p>The bus is a symbol of how the venerable, Foreign Office-funded World Service has moved into the \"tri-media age\" in the past two years, overlapping increasingly with the-loss making commercial channel BBC World News. Earlier this year, the World Service unveiled its own Arabic and Farsi TV channels while the commercially funded BBC World added News to its name, reflecting a sharpened focus and a drive to move into profit. Add in the overseas requirements of the licence fee funded news operation, which provides resources to the commercial arm and is looking to take advantage of World Service journalists, and the BBC News map of the world starts to look more than a little confusing.</p> <p><strong>Global stage </strong></p> <p>The man charged with making sense of this combination of technological convergence and institutional overlap is Sambrook, who is responsible for the World Service and the commercial news operations. These include the BBC World News channel, which was given a high-profile relaunch this year and is present in 282m homes in 200 countries, and BBC.com/news, which controversially takes advertising following a fraught debate inside and outside the BBC. Last year, BBC World News lost almost \u00a38m but it has pledged to break even by 2010. </p> <p>In the last charter agreement, the BBC added a new public purpose - \"bringing the UK to the world and the world to the UK\". Under director general Mark Thompson, a vision of the BBC as the only British organisation able to compete effectively on the global stage has become a key plank in the argument for the universal licence fee. But Thompson faces increasingly loud protests about the BBC's expansive global commercial ambitions. With his public-private funding combination, Sambrook sits at the centre of the debate. </p> <p>\"We are operating in an incredibly competitive field that is developing very quickly. If we think the BBC should be one of the world's leading news providers, and that it is one of the UK's best opportunities to have a global brand, in the end you're not going to be able to compete purely on the licence fee. And from [Foreign Office]grant in aid, you're not going to be able to fund an online operation that can keep up with the Googles, Yahoos and CNNs and all the rest of it. You've got to go down the commercial route,\" he says. </p> <p>Sambrook adds: \"People say the BBC is expanding too fast and is overly aggressive. I see it the other way around, that we're in danger of falling behind because we're unable to keep up with what is going on out there. We've got to move as fast as we can. It would be a very peculiar time for the BBC to pull back from its international role. It's absolutely the time when the BBC should be moving forward internationally rather than moving back.\"</p> <p>He describes the US experiment as the single biggest example of convergence and co-operation to date. \"We have an interesting role as a global broadcaster. We have to report that campaign and election for the rest of the world but America is a very important audience for us as well. What we aim to bring to that coverage is the international dimension, because we know that's what the American audience wants from the BBC - the global perspective they don't get from their domestic media.\" </p> <p>In his corner office at Bush House, complete with a gigantic world map and obligatory globe, it is difficult to comprehend the scale of the BBC's international news operation. \"We come at it from the audience perspective. How does the audience see it? They see it as news from the BBC. They don't say 'that bit's funded by BBC Worldwide and that bit's funded by grant in aid'. For them, it's just news from the BBC,\" he says. This has effectively led to a complicated internal market where the different bits of the global news organisation pay one another for services. </p> <p><strong>Rapid expansion </strong></p> <p>It was once simple - on one hand the World Service on radio and, since 1995, a (loss-making) commercial TV arm on the other - but the lines have blurred. Both have launched a string of online and mobile companions - funded by ads in the case of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news\">BBC.com/news</a> and not in the case of the World Service spin-off language websites. \"Part of my job is to work out how the jigsaw fits together,\" says Sambrook. </p> <p>The World Service has been revamped under its director Nigel Chapman, who reports to Sambrook, with a rapid expansion online and a drive to broadcast through local partners on FM rather than the crackly shortwave frequency. Chapman's reforms were far from popular, but they have resulted in record radio audiences of 183 million and notable successes online. Sambrook thinks they were the only way forward in a rapidly changing landscape. </p> <p>Something of an early adopter himself, Sambrook was the first senior BBC executive to have his own personal blog (<a href=\"http://sambrook.typepad.com\">sambrook.typepad.com</a>). He also writes a companion blog on his musical tastes. </p> <p>\"[The web] undermines all the old certainties about news provision. Traditionally, news has been based on a limited access. Now, there's no barrier to distribution and someone with a laptop can do what the World Service does. It is moving very fast,\" he says. </p> <p>Asked about the ambitious new, \u00a340m-a-year Arabic satellite TV channel, charged with taking on al-Jazeera 24 hours a day in its middle-eastern heartland, he insists fears among some observers that the service would be seen as a British foreign policy tool have proved unfounded. His view becomes a little less rose-tinted when an assistant comes into the room and slips him a piece of paper that reveals the result of a ballot for strike action at the fledgling channel - staff have voted by four to one for industrial action after accusing management of trying to run the service \"on the cheap\". \"They have decided they want to work less and be paid more. And the answer is, I'm sorry - you can't work that way,\" says Sambrook, his voice hardening. </p> <p>He is similarly dismissive of union complaints that the move by the World Service to employ more local journalists is driven by economic rather than journalistic imperatives. If anything, he says in what is clearly a well-rehearsed argument, there will be an ever greater need for more indigenous reporters.</p> <p>\"The nature of international coverage is changing. The old model of a western fireman who travels in and stays in a five star hotel, brushes his hair and does his piece, is disappearing. What people want is real expertise from people who are indigenous, who are real experts, who know the country and breathe it,\" he says. </p> <p>He obviously still loves the job. \"This was the only obvious other job for me in the BBC and I was delighted to do it. Not everyone believed me at the time, but it was true. I think it is the most interesting job at the BBC and also the most complicated. This is the moment when we've really got to reinvent the whole business and the nature of what we do.\"</p> <h2>Curriculum Vitae</h2> <p><strong>Age</strong> 52</p> <p><strong>Education</strong> Oakwood grammar school, Maidstone; Reading University; Birkbeck College</p> <p><strong>Career</strong><br><strong>1977 </strong>trainee journalist, Thomson Regional Newspapers <strong>1980</strong> subeditor, BBC radio newsroom and then various roles <strong>1992</strong> news editor, BBC Newsgathering <strong>1996</strong> head of Newsgathering <strong>1999</strong> deputy director of news <strong>2001 </strong>director of BBC News <strong>2004</strong> director, BBC Global News</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Monday September 15 2008.

  "<p>During the recent war between Georgia and Russia, bloggers on both sides of the conflict provided searing accounts of atrocities and manoeuvres unseen by western journalists. In a country such as Russia the space for alternative and critical views are rare. The war showed an authoritarian regime's narrative being challenged by a handful of insiders and outsiders. The government-run media looked staid by comparison. </p> <p>This was merely the latest example of bloggers beating mainstream journalists at their own game. Online media have exploded in western nations, challenging decades-old business models and forcing reporters to answer questions about their methods and sources. But in repressive states, blogs and websites have become essential sources of information on topics - from women's issues to sexual orientation, dating rituals to human rights - routinely shunned by channels for official propaganda. </p> <p>These openings for citizens in the non-western world to be heard are far more empowering than the equivalent outlets in our own societies. But how often do we hear these voices in the west?</p> <p>September 11, for example, should have been the perfect opportunity for the western media to listen to the grievances of the Muslim world. Alas, with notable exceptions, indigenous voices were excluded then and still remain largely absent from the pages of the world's leading papers. It is as if only a western journalist's filter can validate such perspectives.</p> <h2>Hearing local voices</h2> <p>In 2007 I travelled to Iran, Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Cuba and China to speak to dissidents, bloggers, writers, politicians and ordinary citizens about how the internet is changing their countries. I wanted to gauge their interests, desires, frustrations and attitudes towards each other and the west. My new book, The Blogging Revolution, is a chance for these local voices to reveal how the web has democratised their minds - although it also reflects the fact that the vast majority of global netizens prefer online dating and downloading pirated films and music to challenging political orthodoxy. </p> <p>Also addressed is whether multinationals such as Google, Yahoo, Microsoft and Cisco have played a part in assisting net filtering and censorship in China, Cuba and the Middle East. On the eve of the Beijing Olympic Games, Naomi Klein wrote that western firms were essential in \"authoritarian communism - central planning, merciless repression, constant surveillance - harnessed to advance the goals of global capitalism.\" </p> <p>How much do we know about Yahoo's or Google's willingness to modify their behaviour to please paranoid officials? I discovered that the western executives of these companies have been more than comfortable with allowing their Chinese counterparts to self-censor thousands of sensitive keywords; far more than just \"democracy\" and \"Falun Gong\". Moreover, they are ignoring disturbing developments such as Yahoo China's decision earlier this year to post images of wanted Tibetans on its home page after the Lhasa uprising. </p> <h2>Democratic force</h2> <p>An important question the book poses is whether the web is an automatic democratiser, as is widely assumed in western media circles. The general consensus, across the globe, was that political and military meddling by Washington and London was making the job of real democrats much more difficult. </p> <p>As one blogger told me in Tehran: \"Most of the people I know are in favour of reform, not revolution, because people are too tired to experience another revolution.\" I found the same message echoed throughout the countries I visited: the desire to experience incremental change without foreign involvement.</p> <p>Take China. It has 250 million internet users - now the largest online community in the world, far surpassing America - based in both the cities and rural areas. Politics is often the furthest thing from their minds, but connecting with friends has become an essential part of life. I met very few bloggers who wanted to discuss anything political and most expressed general satisfaction with the regime's economic policies. No great desire for \"democratisation\" there.</p> <p> Mica Yushu, a blogger in Shanghai, told me that most of her middle-class friends didn't crave political change. \"We use the internet mostly for entertainment, sharing information, earning money or other fun,\" she said. The sight of darkened internet cafes across the country was something to behold, with thousands of users gaming, watching soft-core pornography, blogging and instant messaging.</p> <p>A recent study by the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project found that the vast majority of China's web users expressed support for Beijing managing or controlling the internet, including the banning of \"pornographic\" sites. This is not to say that the Chinese desire authoritarian rule; but while they want change, curbing corruption and ensuring essential services are their top priorities, not the advances in human rights the west puts at the top of the agenda. </p> <p>After the Beijing Games, Chinese bloggers fiercely debated the economic direction the country should take over the coming years. It was a far more robust debate than one would expect from coverage of China in the west, where the emphasis is always on rampant nationalism. </p> <p>One anonymous blogger noted - after sarcastically praising the country's free-market reforms as the \"best system seen not just in Chinese history, but also in humankind's\" - that greater political development could only come with a \"basic welfare system.\" Such discussions on a massive scale were impossible in China before the internet. Equally important debates are occurring in every country I visited. </p> <p>Allowing people to speak and write for themselves without a western filter is one of the triumphs of blogging. The online culture, disorganised and disjointed in its aims, is unlike that of any previous social movement. While some want the right to criticise their leaders, others simply want the ability to flirt and listen to subversive tunes. That is revolutionary for much of the world.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://antony- loewenstein.com/\">Antony Loewenstein</a> is a Sydney-based journalist, blogger and author of The Blogging Revolution</p>",
  "<p>Bad things happen in early September. Wars have started, terrorists have struck, financial markets have trembled. In Britain 16 years ago, the first half of September saw the build-up to Black Wednesday; last year it saw the run on Northern Rock.</p> <p>This year has been no different. If the US Treasury imagined that its takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would restore confidence in the financial markets, then it was quickly disabused of that fanciful notion. By the end of the week, American policymakers were preparing for another weekend at their desks as the predators switched their attention to the limping stragglers of the pack: Lehman Brothers, Washington Mutual and American International Group. These companies are big beasts of the financial jungle: Lehman is the fourth-biggest US investment bank; Washington Mutual is the largest US savings and loan association; AIG is one of the country's biggest insurers.</p> <p>Clearly, there has been a ripple effect from the credit crunch through the rest of the economy. What's remarkable, however, has been how muted the impact on \"the real economy\" has been. Consumer spending in the US and the UK has not collapsed. Unemployment has risen, but it has not gone through the roof. Economies have slowed and bits of continental Europe have already seen output fall, but this is not the Great Depression. </p> <p>The consensus view - in the financial markets and among policymakers - is that this trend will continue. To be sure, there will be some short-term pain but by the end of next year more normal conditions will have returned to financial markets and the drop in oil prices will diminish both inflationary pressure and the squeeze on real incomes. Interest rates will be coming down and consumer spending, while still weak, will be picking up. </p> <p><strong>Genie</strong></p> <p>According to this view of the world, policymakers should be wary of being over-hasty: cuts in interest rates could entrench inflation; bail-outs for housing could impede the self-healing process of markets. Paul Tucker, the Bank of England's director of markets, said last week: \"If in the interests of sustaining growth in the short run, we were to let inflation become established at higher levels, things could easily get out of control as higher medium-term inflation expectations would become embedded. We would then find it much harder to bring inflation back to target, and could well end up having to generate a serious recession to put the genie back in the bottle.\"</p> <p>This is a comforting view of the world. It suggests that the problems of the global economy are manageable, that the framework for economic policy is the right one and that policymakers know what they are doing. It is sincerely to be hoped that all three assumptions are correct, because there are some pretty powerful arguments pointing in the opposite direction.</p> <p>The first is historical. Over the decades, there have been many false signals of trouble ahead, but a rocketing oil price has not been one of them. Every time there has been a spike in the cost of crude, the global economy has gone into recession. There were oil shocks in 1973, 1979-80 and 1990; there were recessions in the mid-1970s, the early 1980s and the early 1990s. While the recent plunge in the oil price has been most welcome (indeed, it is the single biggest reason for hoping that the worst can be avoided), there has still been a fivefold increase over the past six years. By comparison, there was a quadrupling of the oil price in late 1973 and a doubling in 1979-80. Even at $100 a barrel, oil is mightily expensive.</p> <p>On top of this, there is the profoundly deflationary impact of the credit crunch. In the first half of 2007, half of the UK's mortgage loans came from lenders raising money on the world's money markets - that source of funding has dried up and not been replaced. Banks have lost money on their investments in fancy derivative products and have tried to get some of it back by increasing the cost of their services to their customers. The problems at Fannie and Freddie, Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Washington Mutual and the institutions next in line for a mauling suggest that this is a different sort of crisis.</p> <p>And that's the third worry. The Belgian economist Professor Paul De Grauwe, from the University of Leuven, makes the point that economic policymakers, like military strategists, only have a number of reference points against which to judge their actions. In the whole of the 20th century, there were only a handful of seminal events - </p> <p>Germany's hyperinflation, the slump of the 1930s, the stagflation of the 1970s. De Grauwe's fear is that just like the French military establishment in the 1930s, the economics community has created its own Maginot Line - perfect for fighting the last war (the inflation of the 1970s) but cumbersome in the face of a new threat (financial implosion compounded by the impact of more closely integrated financial markets).</p> <p>If De Grauwe is right, the countries that have flexible and unified command structures will almost certainly be best placed to cope. Over the past 11 years, coordination between the Bank of the England and the Treasury has been good, and even today there are few serious policy rifts. Yet, the Bank's system of setting interest rates is flawed; it is based on a measure of inflation that does not include housing costs but does include goods (fuel and food) over which it has no control. Moreover, there is the potential for the wrong mix of policy, with over-tight monetary policy leading to a ballooning of the budget deficit. That was precisely how Japan got monetary policy wrong in the 1990s.</p> <p>None of the above means that the forecasts of a soft landing or a relatively brief hard landing are necessarily wrong. Policymakers, despite De Grauwe's concerns, may indeed have learned the right lessons from the past war and be ready to face the current one. Today's CBI forecasts - falling UK output in the second half of 2008 and minimal growth in 2009 - is the new consensus. The US authorities' frenetic activism may succeed in putting a floor under the housing market, thereby halting losses in the financial sector. China may ride out the crisis, even though its two biggest export markets - the US and Europe - are flirting with recession and there is every sign that the global economy is as synchronised on the way down as it was on the way up.</p> <p><strong>Headwinds</strong></p> <p>On the other hand, the consensus view has been consistently over-optimistic. The Treasury, the Bank of England, the City and economists have all had to pare back their forecasts as recessionary headwinds have grown more powerful. Who is to say that the new, allegedly more sober, forecasts are more accurate? It was assumed that the problems of the sub-prime mortgage market would be contained. They weren't. It was thought the financial crisis would blow over. It didn't. It was assumed that bailing out banks would get them lending again. It hasn't. It was assumed that damage would be limited if unemployment stayed low. It is now rising.</p> <p>All of which, to me, suggests that the risk of something much more serious is now a strong possibility, if by no means a stone-cold certainty. The data over the next couple of months - starting with Wednesday's figures for joblessness - will show whether the price of manning a Maginot Line is an economic Dunkirk.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>I'm sure you've heard the news. The cold war is back. Or history has returned. Or we're now in the 19th century world of great power politics. Russia's attack on Georgia has unleashed a barrage of cliches. Globalisation and integration have been exposed as shams. Our naive idea that we were living in a benign international environment has been shattered.</p> <p>Most of this commentary is a massive overreaction. Who in the past few decades believed that international life has been problem-free? John McCain ominously intoned that the Russian attack was the \"first serious crisis since the end of the cold war\". Really? What about the attacks of 9/11, not to mention the Iraq war, the Balkan wars, the genocide in Rwanda?</p> <p>There has been a deep yearning for a return of history. We all miss that world of good and evil, ideological struggle and high stakes. And it's certainly true that international life has changed. But what is new is the acceleration of global capitalism and trade, and the remarkable growth this is producing across the globe. </p> <p>In 2006 and 2007, 124 countries recorded economic growth of 4% a year or more. This is utterly unprecedented, and is giving rise to a new, genuinely global international order. After two decades of unipolarity - with America dominating the globe economically, politically, culturally, and militarily - we are moving into a post-American world, one shaped in many lands and by many people. Within a period of one month, India flexed its muscles to derail the global trade talks, China put on the greatest show on earth in Beijing, and Russia attacked its neighbour. </p> <p>But in order to understand properly the age in which we live, we must stop making bad analogies. This is not a return to the 19th century, when Russian actions would have been standard operating procedure for a great power. In fact, only 50 years ago Britain and France clung to their empires - in Algeria, Vietnam, Kenya, Cyprus - with more determination and violence than Moscow. This is the first time since the break-up of the Soviet Union that Moscow has sent troops into a neighbouring country (a country that it had ruled since 1801). Its actions are deplorable but the reaction to them - worldwide - is a sign of how much the rules have changed.</p> <p>The countries bordering Russia all condemned the move and rallied around Nato, the European Union, and the US. Even Belarus is making some friendly gestures westward.</p> <p>Far from revealing a new \"alliance of autocracies\", as Robert Kagan had prophesied, the crisis has shown how divergent are the interests of China and Russia. Beijing expressed dismay at the attack and helped provide loans to Georgia. Central Asia's dictatorships also distanced themselves from Moscow's actions. And Russia's stock market has been battered, its currency has sunk, foreign investment has dried up, and for years to come businessmen will view it as a great risk to do business there.</p> <p>Why is this happening? Poland is doing well, Kazakhstan is a natural resource power, the Baltics are booming. They are connected to a larger world and will not meekly accept Russia's \"privileged sphere\". </p> <p>It has always been possible for big countries to push around their neighbours - something the US has not been exempt from itself. What's new now is that there are growing political, economic, and financial costs to such actions, unless they have widespread legitimacy. That will not always deter a great power, but it certainly will make them think. There are already signs that some in Russia's ruling elite are wondering whether 70,000 South Ossetians have been worth all this.</p> <p>We are not entering a new cold war. And if we do, the second time will be farce. Russia is a much smaller part of the world than it was when it launched the first one. In the late 1940s, the Soviet Union had the world's largest army and comprised between 15% and 20% of global GDP. Today Russia has a much smaller armed force and makes up a bit more than 2% of global GDP. If there is to be a period of tension between Russia and the west, the outcome is predetermined.</p> <p>The forces of globalisation are, in fact, producing an extraordinary degree of integration around the world. The broader challenge is that growth being produced by this globalisation is everywhere producing political nationalism and assertiveness. These forces can be benign and constructive - when we like them we call them patriotism and cultural pride - but they can also be aggressive and xenophobic. The central tension of the world we live in will be between the forces of global integration on the one hand and those of nationalism on the other.</p> <p>But history doesn't repeat itself. It only seems to do so to people who don't know the details. We're in the 21st century and it will not look like the 19th or 18th centuries. Our problems will be different. We live in times of extraordinary prosperity (more broadly shared across the globe than ever before) and yet filled with perils - from terrorism to climate change. It doesn't scare me, but it does make me wish we had better leaders.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Fareed Zakaria is the editor of Newsweek International and author of The Post-American World <a href=\"mailto: comments@fareedzakaria.com\">comments@fareedzakaria.com</a></p>",
  "<p>It may not be the most pressing thing on ITV chairman Michael Grade's mind, but his company's exit from the FTSE 100 last week was nonetheless a symbolic blow for the UK's leading commercial broadcaster. ITV had been counted among the London Stock Exchange's blue chips since it was listed as a single plc in February 2004 following the merger of Carlton and Granada - and Granada first entered the FTSE 100 in September 2000.</p> <p>ITV's departure from the index, which becomes effective next week, leaves the media sector represented by only five groups in the list of London's 100 biggest companies by market capitalisation.</p> <p>It is a far cry from the heady days of the dotcom boom in 2000, when there were 10 media companies in the FTSE 100, and a staggering 29 in technology, media and telecoms combined. The largest of the survivors is the global news and information group Thomson Reuters, worth more than \u00a312bn just a few months after the Anglo-Canadian merger that created it. Then there is the pay-TV and broadband company BSkyB, valued at around \u00a38bn, the professional media group Reed Elsevier at \u00a36.7bn, the advertising giant WPP at \u00a36.3bn and Pearson, the owner of the Financial Times and Penguin Books, which is worth \u00a35.5bn.</p> <p>By contrast, ITV's value has slid to just \u00a31.8bn, about a third of where it was when it made its debut as a merged company. Falling ratings at the flagship ITV1 channel and a severe slowdown in advertising, abetted by the punishing contract rights renewal system, have conspired to send its shares ever lower, though they have rallied slightly from a nadir in July. There is arguably a further discount attributable to the 17.9% stake that BSkyB still owns and is expected to sell, pending a ruling from the competition appeal tribunal.</p> <p>ITV's disappearance from the FTSE 100 comes six months after the last media casualty, the directories business Yell, dropped out amid fears over its high levels of debt. At the end of last year the media sector also lost the Daily Mail &amp; General Trust, which had been struggling to hang on to advertising revenues, in common with the rest of the newspaper industry. </p> <p>Andy Viner, the head of media at the accountancy firm BDO Stoy Hayward, who has tracked the performance of TMT stocks over the past decade, says the companies that have fallen by the wayside could all point to their dependence on the faltering advertising market to explain the collapse in their share price.</p> <p>\"If you look at the companies that are left, they're less susceptible to the cycle than those focused on advertising spend,\" he says. Thomson Reuters and Sky both have a subscription-based model, Reed has been trying to reduce its exposure to advertising, while WPP is shifting its operations from traditional advertising towards marketing services.</p> <p>Another problem, he adds, is that some companies failed to hit on a digital strategy in the relatively prosperous years of the mid-2000s, when the overall FTSE 100 was trending upwards. \"There's some disappointment in the way people have looked at new channels for market,\" he says. </p> <p>Paul Richards, a media analyst at Numis Securities, agrees: \"The likes of Sky, Reed and WPP have not been negatively impacted by the analogue to digital migration - they have been big beneficiaries.\" He argues that companies such as ITV and DMGT have also been hampered by their reliance on the struggling UK economy and marked down by investors for their debt levels and pension liabilities.</p> <p>As media groups lose their market value, they become vulnerable to takeover, hence the other major trend of recent years: the invasion of the private sector. Two former FTSE 100 companies of the past decade have now slipped into private ownership. Last year the music group EMI was bought up by Guy Hands's group Terra Firma, five years after it first fell out of the FTSE 100. And Emap, which lost its top-100 status in 2005, was broken up between the privately held German group Bauer and the partnership between Guardian Media Group, owner of the Guardian, and Apax Partners. </p> <p>Will that be ITV's fate as well? The German media giant Bertelsmann, the Dutch group Endemol or a private equity group could yet come in with a bid, but in the current economic climate the odds seem long. If, as most analysts expect, Sky has to sell its stake, then ITV's shares could well get a bounce but, given the state of the advertising market, it may not be enough in the short term for it to regain its prestigious place among the City's big boys.</p> <p>Richards, however, believes ITV has reason to be optimistic. \"As soon as you start to feel optimistic about the state of the UK economy, the first thing you do is buy [shares in] a free-to-air broadcaster, there's nothing more cyclical than that. I wouldn't be surprised if in a year or two ITV was back in the FTSE 100.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>This week it was announced that the classic 1970s children's programmes Rentaghost and Worzel Gummidge may make a comeback</strong></p> <h2>Anna Ford, host, The Garden Quiz, Radio 4: former newsreader</h2> <p>The programme I still miss is Morecambe &amp; Wise. They were just so funny; there was no one like them. They made me laugh so much I used to fall off the sofa.</p> <p>One of my biggest regrets is not going on their annual Christmas special when I was a BBC newsreader. They kept on asking me, saying they had the perfect sketch, and I kept turning them down, saying I didn't do that sort of thing - partly it's because I am not an extrovert. Then Angela Rippon did do the show - she did the famous dancing sketch with the high kicks, with such skill that it is still talked about. No, I think I really should not have been so serious. But it's far too late.</p> <h2>Roger Graef, chief executive Films of Record</h2> <p>I initially thought I'd like to bring back The Saint, the smooth detective Simon Templar, played by Roger Moore, in the 1960s, but that was such a long time ago - probably no one can remember it.</p> <p>The character I really would like to have more of, though, is Basil Fawlty, and Fawlty Towers. I think every time you go into a new hotel, you think of him and his staff, it just haunts the memory, you fear the worst - or at least, I do. And in fact, I'd like more of the whole ensemble: Manuel, Sybil the wife, Polly the clever waitress. I have worked with John Cleese since then. John the perfectionist made 12 episodes (starting in 1975) and stopped. But time and cultural changes make it all the more necessary to see updated skewering of pretension, and such naked aggression on display. Basil Fawlty is just a wonderfully funny character, a wild performance, and painfully true.</p> <h2>Simon Bates, presenter, Classic FM, former Radio 1 DJ</h2> <p>When it comes to kids' television, I am a Luddite. Like most people of my age I had two periods of intense exposure to children's programmes: the era of </p> <p>Noggin the Nog, Top Cat, The Secret Garden, and all those Sunday teatime Dickens adaptations; and then, when I was sturdily unemployed, Rhubarb and Custard and The Magic Roundabout.</p> <p>So, and since I loved all that stuff ... the last thing I ever want is a remake of anything, no matter how primitive and naive it must all have been. Besides, did you have to sit through Magic Roundabout: The Movie?

We're missing it on television today.</p>",
  "<p>The European commission will today propose updating a 12-year-old global IT trading pact to take account of the explosive growth in hi-tech products and to produce further price-cuts.</p> <p>The global market in IT products such as flat-panel screens has expanded dramatically in the past decade to $1.5tn (\u00a3838bn) of exports or a fifth of total world exports of manufactured goods, the EC said. </p> <p>When the Information Technology Agreement (ITA) was signed in 1996 it was by 14 signatories who represented trade in IT product exports amounting to $600bn. It has now been signed by 70 countries representing 97% of IT trade.</p> <p>The EC is proposing, at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in Geneva, to modernise and expand the ITA, originally designed to eliminate tariffs and duties on an agreed range of products by 2000.</p> <p>Peter Mandelson, EU trade commissioner, said last night: \"The ITA remains a milestone duty-free agreement, but it risks being left behind after 12 years of technological development. We need an ITA for the 21st century that will continue to benefit our consumers and businesses.\"</p> <p>The EC approach is to urge global negotiations at the WTO to modernise the agreement. Others, notably the US, Japan and Taiwan, have tended to launch disputes over how to classify certain IT products. These include LCD screens that can now be hooked up to TVs and video recorders, set-top boxes and multi-functional copy machines. Some of these can enter importing countries duty-free while others cannot, depending on their classification.</p> <p>This year, the US and Japan joined with Taiwan in a WTO complaint about how the EU treats these products. The EC has rejected their complaints, saying it meets all its obligations.</p> <p>Mandelson's officials said modern technology was so evolved that several products fell outside the scope of the ITA.</p> <p>Similarly, they said, countries continued to impose non-tariff barriers that were a real obstacle to market access. These include bureaucratic practices to certify compliance with technical regulations or the application of obscure local standards. They added that the EC was aiming to sign up more members to the agreement, which has been endorsed by China and India.</p> <p>Mandelson, coming towards the close of his EU mandate, is keen to get a quick launch and conclusion to negotiations, with officials talking of a potential deal within months. He says this would expand global trade and cut consumer prices.</p> <p>This comes just two months after talks on liberalising world trade in agriculture, industry and services collapsed, prompting fears of protectionism in global trade.</p>",
  "<p>Derek Llambias chose to watch Newcastle United's latest undoing slouched in a seat adjacent to an exit with a supercilious smirk playing round his mouth and minders hovering close by. The club's managing director seemed to have perfected the impression of a man running scared while affecting not to care but at least Llambias actually turned up, which is more than can be said of Mike Ashley and Dennis Wise.</p> <p>On a day when true leaders would have faced the music, Newcastle's thin-skinned owner and his director of football passed up the chance to confront a Toon Army still incandescent at events prefacing Kevin Keegan's resignation. </p> <p>Granted, Ashley put the club on the market last night but, having insisted it will not be a \"fire sale\", the billionaire sports retailer could find himself stuck with Newcastle for some time. There is talk of an interested Chinese property developer but the global credit crunch allied to Ashley's desire to at least recoup his \u00a3250m investment may delay things. </p> <p>In the meantime, relegation could be a real possibility if the club is left rudderless. All the organisation on view on Saturday derived either from Hull City or protesting Newcastle fans. When it came to skilled choreography, Michael Owen and co never looked like producing a move remotely as eye-catching as the sight of thousands of supporters sweeping around the south-west corner of St James' Park and temporarily barricading the main reception where, just eight months ago, they had serenaded King Kev's second coming.</p> <p>Displaying a certain selective amnesia - remember how the replica-shirt-wearing, pint-swilling Ashley spent several months as \"wor Mike, the toast of the Toon\" after ousting the then-reviled former chairman, Freddy Shepherd? - those fans variously bellowed \"Cockneys out\" and \"Walking in a Keegan wonderland\". One suspected that, had Shepherd suddenly appeared, he would have been lifted on to willing shoulders, garlanded with flowers and feted as a returning saviour. </p> <p>Romantics cling to the hope of Keegan's restoration under a new regime but, given his insistence on the removal of Ashley's muckers, Wise, Llambias and Tony Jimenez, that seems a forlorn notion. Moreover, for all his virtues, Keegan perhaps does not represent the best way forward for a club too sentimentally attached to handing the job to someone born within spitting distance of the Tyne or boasting a past association with the club.</p> <p>The usually perceptive Sir Bobby Robson was peddling such an approach yesterday when he advocated Steve Bruce but if Chelsea, Liverpool and Arsenal can all thrive under foreign coaches why should Newcastle be any different? With the team in disarray, whoever takes over - and now that Paul Ince has apparently withdrawn, Newcastle's shortlist comprises Gus Poyet, Didier Deschamps and Tony Adams - cannot be appointed quickly enough. </p> <p>Their first act could be to strip Owen of the captaincy. While Hull fans chorused \"Are you Grimsby in disguise?\" Owen sulked rather than got on his team-mates' cases. Tellingly, when Chris Hughton, Newcastle's caretaker manager, offered tactical advice, Owen's face turned thunderous.</p> <p>In mitigation the striker, who worked hard enough at his own game, could hardly be blamed for Danny Guthrie's petulance. The ill-disciplined midfielder was sent off in the 90th minute for twice kicking Craig Fagan. Refreshingly, Phil Brown, Hull's animated manager tended to receive thumbs-up signals when he, sometimes unceremoniously, told players to do things differently. Their captain, Ian Ashbee, was an equally galvanising central-midfield leader.</p> <p>In the 34th minute Hull's impressive Marlon King opened the scoring from the penalty spot after Nicky Butt felled Peter Halmosi. Wise's failure to buy a left-back was one of the reasons Keegan resigned and watching the gifted but horribly out of position Charles N'Zogbia offer his ersatz interpretation of that role it was easy to see why. N'Zogbia was badly at fault for King's second, allowing the striker to cut inside him and curl a fabulous left-footed shot beyond Shay Given.</p> <p>Xisco - signed against Keegan's wishes on transfer deadline day - applied an unexpected gloss to a generally shocking debut by tapping home the rebound after N'Zogbia's late shot ricocheted off a post. But Brown was not about to be denied revenge for the beating-up he took while watching Sunderland here in the 1970s.</p> <p>No shrinking violet, Hull's manager - who seemed highly amused by the content of a congratulatory text from Keegan's predecessor, Sam Allardyce - and his players had been involved in lively exchanges with a Geordie wedding party staying at the team's Northumberland hotel on Friday night. Although he dismissed the incident as \"a storm in a teacup\", Hull checked out of Slaley Hall shortly before 10pm and diverted to alternative accommodation.</p> <p>A controversial last-minute decision it may have been but at least Brown possessed the leadership qualities to make that call.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Marlon King (Hull)</p>",
  "<p>Just when it seems British farming had achieved a period of calm, and possibly even profitability, it started to rain. Soggy wheat fields may have dried out a little under yesterday's autumn sun, but the harvest is still set to be the worst in 40 years. Shoppers may be pleased that healthy crops in the rest of Europe and around the world have sent grain prices downwards. But that has only made the problems facing British farmers worse.</p> <p>Should anyone care? Farmers are notorious for their gloomy outlooks. But sometimes they have something to be gloomy about. There is an almost biblical tone to the frequency of the crises that have afflicted them since foot and mouth first struck in 2001. Some have been political, like Britain's unique decision to adopt a big bang approach to the change in EU subsidies from production to the environment that led to long delays and larger overdrafts. Some, like depressed prices, have been side effects of globalisation and supermarket pressure. Some have been human error - like last year's foot and mouth outbreak caused by duff drainage at a government research laboratory. But one way or another, most reflect the impact of the changing climate, which makes it a particular irony that the first blow to farmers this summer was the heavy burden of increased fuel costs both on inputs like fertilisers and on running expenses (at its worst this summer, it cost \u00a3500 a day to keep a typical mega-tractor working). </p> <p>Whichever way they turn, farmers will see little relief. Organic small farm? The credit crunch is eating into your customers' shopping habits. Sales of organic foods are in freefall and the organic premium on which you banked is looking shaky. On the other hand, if you farm 2,000 acres intensively and have borrowed cash to the equivalent value of a couple of terraced streets in Blackburn to invest in machinery, expecting last year's grain price rises to continue this year, you will probably be looking at proportionately even greater losses. True, many farmers (not tenant ones) have done well out of soaring land prices, but that can only be realised by getting out of the business. In the meantime society is unclear what it thinks Britain's farmers are for: guardians of the landscape, or efficient producers of food, part-protected and subsidised by the rest of us, but some going bust all the same. </p> <p>For most of the last decade, the weather has been extraordinary: either extraordinarily dry or extraordinarily wet. That challenge has made farming harder. A public forced to pay record prices for food may have little sympathy for British farmers sinking into the mud. But they are at the frontline of a changing climate and the way they adapt affects everyone.</p>",
  "<p>I am struggling with a spring fashioned from what appears to be a tight coil of wire, but which has been manufactured, surprisingly, from virgin olive oil. The waiter had been quite clear: stick your finger in the ring, then put it in your mouth. I did as I was told but instead of sliding on to my tongue the ring has congealed about my knuckle. This is the only thing I've ever eaten that involves sticking a finger down my throat.</p> <p>Earlier, I reduced a delicate, tensile sculpture of beetroot ribbons to shrapnel on my plate. The other diners at my table at elBulli don't seem to be having the same difficulties. Beatific smiles cross their faces as the spring melts in the mouth, not on the hand. I should have been quicker and more decisive, like everyone else. Maybe I should have gone into training before eating at the world's most creative restaurant.</p> <p>Across the room, the artist Richard Hamilton is carefully opening a polystyrene box. It looks empty, but a sort of glow lights up his face. Hamilton, now in his 80s, has had a house in nearby Cadaqu\u00e9s since the 1960s, and has been eating here ever since. ElBulli's origins were modest: the restaurant grew out of a summer beach-barbecue joint and a crazy-golf course. The restaurant is perched over a small and somewhat inaccessible cove on the Cap de Creus, where the Pyrenees tumble into the sea, near the border between France and Spain. Salvador Dal\u00ed lived nearby, Picasso developed cubism in Cadaqu\u00e9s and Marcel Duchamp summered there. The only way to get to elBulli is by a narrow winding road over the wild headland, or by boat. It all adds to the sense of occasion.</p> <p>Catalan-born Ferran Adri\u00e1 took over the restaurant in 1987, having started here on work experience after finishing his national service, later joining the staff as chef de partie. The previous owners named elBulli after their bulldogs, and portraits of the animals still grace the walls. ElBulli boasts three Michelin stars, and Adri\u00e1 has so far won the San Pellegrino award for the world's best chef three times. Best restaurant, best chef: what does \"best\" mean? You don't come to elBulli if you are merely hungry, or even if you are just curious. For a start, there's at least a two-year wait for a table.</p> <p>Last year Adri\u00e1 was the first chef to be invited to take part in Documenta, the prestigious five-yearly survey of contemporary art in Kassel, Germany. Instead of cooking at Documenta or presenting visitors with edible art, Adri\u00e1 designated elBulli itself as a Documenta pavilion, and two exhibition visitors - selected, we are told, at random - were invited every day to come and eat in this corner of Catalonia. (ElBulli's tasting menu normally costs around \u00a3175 a head.) What Adri\u00e1 does is definitely an art, if not art itself. In the free-for-all of what has come to be called \"relational aesthetics\", a social event, whether it is meeting for a meal or just hanging out in the gallery and talking to strangers, can be seen as empowering and creative. The artist sets up the conditions; you do the rest. At its worst, this sort of thing can be a vacuous, self-congratulatory and smug example of group bonding and grooming, and brings with it an aura of in-crowd exclusivity. </p> <p>We are here to do more than indulge ourselves. The restaurant is full tonight of artists, art theorists and critics, gastronauts and curators. The morning after the meal, at one of two round-table discussions about gastronomy, art and culture, Heston Blumenthal, chef of Britain's Fat Duck, is uneasy about the idea that he might be an artist, although he does compare restaurant-going to a trip to the theatre, the cinema or an art gallery. \"Restaurants can still generate excitement, emotion, sadness, but they can do it in a way that's quite unique, because you're putting food into your body,\" Blumenthal said. He joined artists Carsten H\u00f6ller (whose giant slides installed in Tate Modern's Turbine Hall were a great hit in 2006), British artist Anya Gallaccio, who has recently been collaborating with Californian wine-makers to produce a wine as an artwork, Austrian film historian Peter Kubelka and Miami-based Catalan artist Miralda at the discussion I chaired. But tonight we eat at different tables, and scribble and dribble on our notepads as we make our way through a 40-course menu. </p> <p>Miralda, whose art has often involved food, for many years ran International, a restaurant in New York where Tate Modern director Vicente Todoli was briefly a waiter while a student. Todoli, with Richard Hamilton, devised tonight's event and the talks that follow for a forthcoming book about art and food. ElBulli has never been closed for an event like this before. Friends get restaurant rage when I tell them I'm coming here; I have wanted to eat at elBulli for over a decade. My waiter sashays over with a small purple meringue. Two bites, I'm instructed. There's some sort of yoghurty substance on the top, yet the meringue itself is - surprise! - empty. Perhaps there's some kind of scented air inside that I missed. Maybe it'll repeat on me later.</p> <p>To eat here is to engage in an experience that is both intensely communal and solitary and subjective. When you eat you're on your own. Tonight's dinner involves all the senses, it engages the mind, and is also, at times, a strangely emotional experience. The dishes can be confrontational as well as exquisite, and what delights and intrigues some can also put off faint hearts. Almost 10 years ago I spent a couple of days with Adri\u00e1 and his team of young chefs at his workshop near the Boqueria market on the Ramblas in Barcelona. This is where they experiment with new dishes for the forthcoming season. The Boqueria is his sculptor's yard of materials and supplies. My visit coincided with a week when the main focus of concentration and experiment was provided by several kilos of pig fat.</p> <p>\"Joselito's Iberian pork fat\" is on tonight's menu too, although what the waiter brings to the table appears to be a giant haricot bean, presented in a small stainless steel bowl. It looks like something a surgeon might show a patient after its successful removal. The bean glistens in the bowl. The flavour of pork is strong but not overwhelming. It is the bean itself that's made from Joselito's famous fat, first rendered into an intense cocido or stew, and it comes with a black, carbonised chunk of garlic on the side. Wait a second. Whatever it is only looks like nuked garlic, and melts like jelly. I have difficulty chasing the flavours around, and identifying their exact origin. \"Decontextualisation, irony, spectacle and performance are completely legitimate, as long as they are not superficial but respond to, or are closely bound up with, a process of gastronomic reflection,\" says Adri\u00e1's Synthesis of elBulli Cuisine, published on the restaurant's website. Artists could do with a few rules like this.</p> <p>Food and eating is probably the oldest aspect of human culture. Food was the first sculpture, Peter Kubelka insists the next morning, observing that people who say Adri\u00e1 turned eating into art might as well say that James Joyce invented literature. It was always art, he says. It would certainly be strange if artists did not turn their attention to this most basic and profound aspect of life. Miralda has presented food as art. Artist Daniel Spoerri opened a restaurant in Dusseldorf as an artwork in the early 1960s. One night Joseph Beuys was guest chef there, and served up grilled herring bones. Beuys also famously worked with honey and fat, seeing them as symbolic and sacramental. </p> <p>Spoerri would interrupt diners at his restaurant mid-meal, and make them leave everything on the table, which he would then glue down and hang on the wall as a sort of tableau, replete with dirty plates, ashtrays and whatever else had been left on the stained tablecloth. Artist Rirkrit Tiravanija has frequently doled out bowls of noodle soup as part of his performances, and when he installed a life-size replica of his New York apartment at London's Serpentine Gallery, visitors were free to cook themselves a meal in the kitchen. Other artists have gnawed sculptures from chocolate, made installations from table settings and sculptures from potatoes, pots of mussels, sacks of beans and piles of rice, never mind all those still-lives of fish and fowl and fruit and veg, all those illustrated cookbooks painted on the walls of caves.</p> <p>The dishes keep on coming, relentlessly. Like some of Joyce's words, they run together in a stream of consciousness. Richard Hamilton thinks Adri\u00e1's genius lies in his intention to develop a language of food, and he calls Adri\u00e1 a poet. </p> <p>A miniaturised lily pond arrives in a dish. It is like a Japanese haiku, and I don't know whether to eat or just admire it. Its a bit insipid for my taste. And what are we to make of \"Unilateral scampi with 'matcha' tea\" when it arrives? This is a crustacean sliced horizontally along its length, and served on its shell. It lays on its back, as though it has just been maced in the face with green foam. This is the tea. It looked funny, but it tasted funny too, which I don't think was exactly the point. Some things are an acquired taste. Food is definitely a culture. </p> <p>But nowhere is the food at elBulli anything like the poncey abomination of \"fine dining\", in which the chef mucks about with incompatible ingredients and serves up something pretentious and disgusting, and whose nauseating and pretentious concoctions are then described at length in a menu as off-putting as the food itself. Nor is elBulli a novelty restaurant. We're not dining in pitch darkness or being served by dangerous inmates. Nor can we anticipate whatever is coming next: the menu doesn't appear until the very end of the meal, and it is a minimal, brief and sometimes opaque list of dishes. The Catalan version is just as obscure. But greater explanation would spoil the constant stream of surprises, continuing for more than four hours - the green leaf that tasted exactly of oysters; the grilled strawberry with ginger on the outside and an injection of gin on the inside; the polenta gnocchi with coffee and saffron yuba; the perfect razor clam with its gelatin twin in the other half of the opened shell. Playful, arresting, occasionally alarming, the meal is almost like a story. The following day, Blumenthal has the idea of working with a scriptwriter to develop a future menu. If the chef is a director, what does that make the people who eat? Are we the audience or are we the actors? What is clear is that we are all taking part in a kind of group ritual. </p> <p>Our aperitif began with a few atomised squirts of dry martini served from an individual chilled flask, quickly followed with a hot and cold gin fizz as we toyed with a finger food of quick fried rabbit ears, crunchy chicken's feet and \"spherical olives\". These last looked suspiciously symmetrical, each olive served on its individual spoon. \"Bite once,\" the waiter commanded.</p> <p>Apart from the occasional item on a spoon, we're given no cutlery until almost halfway through dinner. Knives never appear. Perhaps they think we'll perform hara-kiri so we can somehow eat it all again. There seem to be as many waiters and sommeliers as diners, all performing an amazing choreography in this small space. They tell us how to eat each dish, and we do it. Somehow, for all their attentiveness, they manage to stay discreet. The service is impeccable, the welcome effusive, and like everyone else who eats at elBulli, we are greeted with a tour of the kitchen, Adri\u00e1's realm, where work goes on unhindered. This, of course, is theatre. A whole line of staff seem to be shelling unripe walnuts. When I eventually get to eat these, they have a weird tensile rubberiness. I imagine babies' bones.</p> <p>Adri\u00e1 is more than an experimental, avant-garde chef - he's a media star and the figurehead of a global operation. He is regularly, cruelly lampooned in cartoons and in the Catalan television satire show Polonia, in which his caricature, like a Spitting Image puppet, regularly appears. Adri\u00e1 takes most of this in good part, and happily provided the voice of an irate restaurant customer in the Disney movie Ratatouille. The chef is also criticised within his profession - too many ingredients, we're told, too much weird science, not enough focus on real food. Like Blumenthal, Adri\u00e1 gets accused of going too far.</p> <p>How far can you go? A news story doing the rounds this summer concerned a Swiss gourmet who, while on a tour of Europe's top restaurants, disappeared mid-meal from elBulli. Police, the press explained, scoured the hillside and combed the rocks below the restaurant. Boats and divers searched the coast. The guy had either exploded with pleasure on the terrace, fallen into the sea or done a runner. Or had he been dispatched by the kitchen staff for one of Adri\u00e1's experiments, and was he about to turn up in tonight's \"game meat canape\"? When it arrived, this was a mousse mostly of hare and chocolate. But there is invariably something unidentifiable about every dish, a little mystery, a nagging question. The story was spoiled when the man later reappeared in Switzerland.</p> <p>The morning after our meal New York magazine's art critic Jerry Saltz compares Adri\u00e1 to the Marquis de Sade, to a vampire and to a cannibal. Saltz, a self-confessed \"food virgin\" who lives on chicken from the neighbourhod deli, was still in a state the morning after. \"Adri\u00e1 went beyond good and evil!\" he exclaimed. For writer Bill Buford, who had also never eaten here before, Adri\u00e1 was a revolutionary. Carsten H\u00f6ller compares elBulli to an amusement park, and our meal to \"licking the world\". H\u00f6ller is currently researching psychotropic plants. Never mind the chef, H\u00f6ller says, I'm not sure if I'm an artist either. I warm to H\u00f6ller, who used to be a scientist. If Adri\u00e1 were a painter, Parkett publishing's founder and editor of Tate magazine Bice Curiger remarks, he'd be Sigmar Polke. Polke, I remember, once painted with poisons.</p> <p>Partway through dinner we get breakfast. I'm presented with a weightless styrofoam box of parmesan-flavoured crunchy foam, over which I'm expected to sprinkle a cellophane sachet of raspberry muesli. Like a long-haul airline meal, this over-wrapped palaver seems to come at the wrong moment. In fact there are several moments when I'm unsure if I can continue. The occasional unprepared diner who came from Documenta last year left their table in tears. Looking across the restaurant, I see that some of tonight's guests are having their own difficult moments. There are a number of genuinely challenging dishes. It is very rare that one can say that about art, though it is a platitude all too often bandied about. We've all had our mealtime tantrums - as children being made to eat something unappetising but good for us, or as adults suddenly finicky, usually for reasons nothing to do with the food itself. My problems tonight began just after the empty meringue. </p> <p>The \"Electric milk 'sechuan buttons'\" appeared harmless enough - a little biscuit dusted with tiny sprouting seeds or herbs. But the effect was like putting a lit sparkler in your mouth, or picking up a cattle prod instead of the lip balm. The front of the tongue and the back of the lips explode with a disconcerting tingle. Miralda tells me he's had a soup of something similar in the Amazon. Killing one's tastebuds and deadening the tongue is an artful prelude to the formless, black lump of sponge that follows, which is reminiscent of something one might find of the floor of a garage, or clogging up an air conditioning unit. On the sponge is a smear of resinous-looking goo. </p> <p>The human race has survived thanks to instinct telling us that some things should not be eaten. When I do overcome my inhibitions, the black sesame sponge cake, with a gel of miso, is interesting, and not at all bad. The mushy white wobbly thing that I'm next presented with tastes of gorgonzola, providing a nice visual and textural contrast. Then we are hit with the grilled strawberry. The menu gets slightly more recognisable after this, with a two-part, mix-in-the-mouth carbonara, and becomes almost classical with tuna bone-marrow \"a la Romana\". The meal goes on ... </p> <p>We drink elBulli's own beer (hints of cardamon, liquorice and ginger), and there's Catalan cava, a Limoux chardonnay and a fabulous 1999 Flor de Pingus. We end, before a chocolate dessert contrived to look like leaf-litter on an autumn forest floor, with suckling pig tail. It makes sense.</p> <p>Adri\u00e1 is a culinary revolutionary, who has spawned an international industry of zealous imitators. Without rules, and a sense of history, however, transgression would be meaningless. Hence Adri\u00e1's resolutely conservative sensibility. He respects rather than ignores the conventions of eating, of restaurants, of his culinary tradition. Adri\u00e1 may create confusion about what one is eating, between what one expects and what one tastes and smells, but he does so with a purpose. Eating is elemental. Digesting, someone says, is metaphor. After the discussions next day, Adri\u00e1 serves us lunch. It is a typical Catalan affair: a lobster and rice stew, cuttlefish black in their own ink, grilled prawns, bread rubbed with tomato and drizzled with oil, and, to finish, a Cadaqu\u00e9s speciality, \"taps\" - sweet, very light plain sponge cakes bought from a patisserie around the headland that morning. This was no Delia Smith cheat. Taps are only made in Cadaqu\u00e9s. They're delicious. And nothing further need be said about them.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Ferran Adri\u00e1 is rising in the art world, but is he losing his relevance to food lovers, asks Tim Hayward.

He accused them of \"losing their moral compass\", employing extravagant lending policies that had triggered the credit crunch. </p> <p>Leftwing Liberal Democrats such as Evan Harris and Simon Hughes fear their leader is abandoning traditional priorities and will seek to pin him down today. </p> <p>But Clegg's influential Treasury spokesman, Vince Cable, defended the leadership's new tax-and-spend package. Arguing that his \"quite modest\" plans to fund tax cuts for low and middle earners would be partly paid for by a \u00a35bn shutdown of tax loopholes for the rich, Cable said there was a strong moral case for the wealthy being required to \"pay their fair share of tax\".</p> <p>Citing the \"unfairness\" of stamp duty on property sales, which hits poorer families hard, he said two main methods are used to avoid payment: placing the property into a special purpose vehicle, attracting tax at a rate of </p> <p>0.5% instead of 3%-4%, or they transferring it to an offshore company.</p> <p>At a lunchtime fringe meeting on the second day of the Liberal Democrats' conference, which opened on Saturday in Bournemouth, Cable warned Labour that a Tory landslide in 2010 could finally lead to the long-discussed \"realignment\" on the centre left.</p> <p>If Labour lost \"massively\", as some polls had suggested, the Liberal Democrats would be \"relatively more powerful than last time\", when a Labour breakaway faction formed the SDP in 1981, Cable suggested. To prepare for that possibility the Lib Dems had to be much clearer about their core values.</p> <p>At the meeting, organised by the Fabian Society and Centre Forum, Cable's thesis was immediately condemned by a fellow-panellist, Charles Clarke, himself a vocal critic of Gordon Brown's style. The former home secretary countered: \"There is no possibility of a realignment of that kind of history in the current discussions that are taking place in the Labour party. That is absolutely not on the agenda in any way whatsoever; there is no SDP group, as there was at that time, around in any shape whatsoever.\"</p> <p>Cable, a former Labour activist who lists John Smith as his personal hero, replied: \"Let us just wait upon events.\" </p> <p>With the Labour government facing defeat and the resurgent Tories threatening their southern strongholds, the Liberal Democrats appear to be both confident and fearful for their future at this year's conference. </p> <p>Yesterday, many made it clear that electoral reform remained central to their hopes for a 21st century dominated by progressive politics.</p> <p>But Clarke made equally plain his view that even cooperation on a \"progressive agenda\" between the two parties would require the Lib Dems to rethink \"irresponsible policies and tactics\", including populist claims that the UK political scene was \"fundamentally corrupt\". </p> <p>Another of Clarke's targets yesterday was the Clegg-Cable economic package, which will be debated today. This includes what Clarke has called \u00a320bn worth of \"sorcerer's savings\" that muddle capital and revenue budgets and \"pluck a 4p [income] tax cut out of the sky\".</p> <p>Cable's plans to reprioritise \u00a320bn-worth of public spending as well as re-arrange \u00a320bn-worth of taxes - so that polluters and the rich pay more - do not explicitly promise a straight 4p tax cut. But its equivalent in terms of raised allowances and other options has yet to emerge.</p> <p>The move is part of Clegg's efforts to protect his southern flank by outbidding the Conservatives on tax cuts while attacking Labour in the north. Clarke, whose Norwich south seat is one of Clegg's top 50 targets, told the fringe meeting that they were free to do that, but should also consider the likely consequence: even more Tory MPs elected.</p> <h2>At conference today</h2> <p><strong>11.15am</strong> Speech by Liberal Democrat health spokesman Norman Lamb on tackling NHS waste</p> <p><strong>12.20pm</strong> Vince Cable will outline proposals to find \u00a320bn savings from government budgets to fund tax cuts and spending priorities</p> <p><strong>2.50pm</strong> Crunch debate on tax plans; amendments have already been tabled</p> <p><strong>4.20pm</strong> Environment question and answer session with Steve Webb, the party's environment spokesman</p> <h2>On the fringe</h2> <p><strong>1pm</strong> <strong>The Guardian debate: </strong><strong>Next election: Threat or opportunity? </strong>With Sir Menzies Campbell, Simon Hoggart, Chris Huhne and Sarah Teather</p> <p><strong>8pm</strong> The Chard group (1992).

  "<p>Shane Clarke had no reason to be suspicious when his wife took their two children to Japan to see their ill grandmother in January.</p> <p>The couple had married four years earlier after meeting online, and settled down with their daughters, aged three and one, in the west Midlands. Clarke, they agreed, would join his family in Japan in May for a holiday, and they would all return together.</p> <p>Last week, however, he faced his wife and her lawyer in a Japanese courtroom, uncertain if he would ever see his children again. When his wife left the UK, Clarke now believes, she never had any intention of returning with him, or of letting her children see him. </p> <p>\"From the moment I met her at Narita airport I knew something was wrong,\" Clarke told the Guardian before a custody hearing in Mito, north of Tokyo. \"I soon realised she'd played me like a grand piano. The whole thing had been orchestrated,\" he claims.</p> <p>Clarke, a 38-year-old management consultant from West Bromwich, has gone to great lengths to win custody. The Crown Prosecution Service said his wife could be prosecuted in the UK under the 1984 child abduction act.</p> <p>However, he can expect little sympathy from Japanese courts, which do not recognise parental child abduction as a crime and habitually rule in favour of the custodial - Japanese - parent.</p> <p>Japan is the only G7 nation not to have signed the 1980 Hague convention on civil aspects of child abduction, which requires parents accused of abducting their children to return them to their country of habitual residence. He is one of an estimated 10,000 parents, divorced or separated from their Japanese spouses, who have been denied access to their children. Since the Hague treaty came into effect, not a single ruling in Japan has gone in favour of the foreign parent.</p> <p>Campaigners say Japan's refusal to join the treaty's 80 other signatories has turned it into a haven for child abductors.</p> <p>The European Union, Canada and the US have urged Japan to sign, but Takao Tanase, a law professor at Chuo University, says international pressure is unlikely to have much impact. \"In Japan, if the child is secure in its new environment and doesn't want more disruption, family courts don't believe that it is in the child's best interest to force it to see the non-custodial parent,\" he said.</p> <p>Japanese courts prefer to leave it to divorced couples to negotiate custody arrangements, Takase said. Officials say the government is looking at signing the Hague treaty, though not soon. </p> <p>\"We recognise that the convention is a useful tool to secure children's rights and we are seriously considering the possibility of signing the convention, but we've yet to reach a conclusion,\" said Yasuhisa Kawamura, a foreign ministry spokesman. </p> <p>\"We understand the anxieties of international parents, but there is no difference between the western approach and ours.\"</p> <p>Clarke's two custody hearings this week did not go well. An interpreter arranged by the foreign office failed to materialise. The British embassy in Tokyo provided him with a list of alternative interpreters but said it could offer no more help. </p> <p>The judge was forced to postpone his ruling, but Clarke is convinced he will never see his daughters again.</p> <p>\"We are talking about two British citizens, and no one will help me. The message our government is sending out to foreign nationals is that it's perfectly all right for them to commit a crime on British soil, and as long as they leave the country quickly enough, they'll get away scot-free.\"</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p>The rise in the number of parental child abductions has been fuelled by a <strong>dramatic increase</strong> in marriages between Japanese and foreign nationals. According to the health and welfare ministry, there were 44,701 such marriages in 2006, compared with 7,261 in 1980, the vast majority between Japanese and <strong>Chinese, Koreans and Filipinos</strong>. An estimated 20,000 children are born to Japanese-foreign couples every year. Though Japan does not keep an official count, there are <strong>47 unresolved cases</strong> of US children being taken to Japan - only Mexico and India are more popular destinations - and 30 involving Canadian citizens. <strong>British officials are dealing with 10 cases</strong>, a foreign office spokeswoman told the Guardian, including that of Shane Clarke.</p>",
  "<p>F&amp;C Management, the UK's oldest investment trust, has teamed up with a group of US and Canadian fund managers to halt Wall Street financial regulators softening the rules on tar sands, arguing that new rules should take account of the carbon impact of reserves disclosed by oil and gas companies.</p> <p>The move reflects changing attitudes among mainstream investors to the impact of commercial activities that could worsen global warming and is aimed at discouraging the US securities &amp; exchange commission (SEC) from allowing energy firms to include carbon-heavy tar sands in their reserves submissions to the regulator.</p> <p>Elizabeth McGeveran, senior vice-president in F&amp;C's governance and sustainable investment team, said it was important for investors to be able to assess accurately the risk profile of reported reserves at a time when governments around the world were taking an increasingly hard line on carbon pollution.</p> <p>\"The energy consumption required to extract a barrel from Canadian tar sands is very different to a barrel of crude from the Gulf of Mexico. Understanding climate risk will assist investors in understanding and evaluating reserves,\" she said.</p> <p>\"SEC regulations already require the disclosure of known trends that companies can reasonably expect will have a material impact on net sales, revenues or income from continuing operations and we believe that the disclosure of any estimated additional risks posed by the extraction and development of additional reserves will be important,\" added McGeveran.</p> <p>The US regulator has been reviewing the regulations on the way reserves are calculated since 2004, when Shell fell foul of its rules and was forced to \"lose\" a quarter of its assets. The move led to fines, a plunging share price and the exit of its chairman, Sir Philip Watts.</p> <p>In June the SEC issued new proposals that would allow previously excluded resources such as oil sands to be \"classified\" as oil and gas reserves. They would also allow companies to disclose their \"probable\" and \"possible\" reserves as well as \"proved\" reserves, as at present.</p> <p>A host of other investors have signed a letter of concern about the tar sands proposals and called for carbon implications to be taken into account. These include the California Public Employees' Retirement System, Ceres and Parnassus Investments.</p> <p>The letter says investors are increasingly concerned about global warming, which is not only recognised as an economic and industrial priority but also as an issue of national security. </p> <p>It adds: \"Therefore, filers [of reserves] should be required to provide investors with information about the carbon content of proven, probable and potential oil reserves in their portfolio as well as the potential liabilities posed by their continued extraction and use.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Monday September 15 2008. In the article above we said Ceres Power had expressed concern about tar sands. The group in question is Ceres, a North American coalition of investors. This has been corrected. </p>",
  "<p>When I was news editor of the Independent on Sunday in the early 1990s, I sent a reporter to a northern council estate. The aim was to expose the reality of poverty as, at the time, there was controversy over whether, in modern Britain, it existed except as a statistical abstraction. The report was vivid, the pictures striking. I was rather pleased with the full page we laid out.</p> <p>Alas, the then editor, Stephen Glover - now a Daily Mail columnist and also my rival press commentator on the Independent - was having none of it. This was not, he said, \"a Sunday-morning read\". The pictures did not show a place \"where I would want to go for a Sunday-morning walk\". I was instructed to spike the piece or at least move it to a less prominent position.</p> <p>I would not accuse the amiable Glover of being indifferent to poverty. On the contrary, in his young fogeyish way, he sometimes became quite angry about it. But the IoS was not selling well and he judged, probably rightly, that the page would add to our reputation for being too worthy and downbeat. A report last week from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation suggests most editors share Glover's views. It examined one week's media output last summer and found 640 reports of poverty.</p> <p>That sounds quite a lot until you learn the team sampled 383 news outlets, including radio, TV and websites, that even readers' letters were included and that more than half the reports were about poverty overseas. Moreover, in 43% of cases, the reference to poverty was little more than a throwaway. Most commonly, poverty is mentioned in another context - crime, health or education, say - and its role downplayed in favour of judgments about the government's failure to provide better policing, schools or hospitals.</p> <p>The media's attitudes are well illustrated by coverage of a recent report from the World Health Organisation. It concluded that \"social injustice is killing people on a grand scale\". In countries with high levels of inequality, the poor, even if they stay off booze, fags and crisps, and even if they are comfortable by international standards, will die early. That explains why African Americans have a lower life expectancy than, for example, inhabitants of Jamaica, Cuba or Lebanon and why poor children in parts of Glasgow won't live as long as children in India, Philippines and Poland. If they reported this at all, most papers gave it less prominence than news that deaths \"linked to\" the hospital infection Clostridium difficile had risen, even though C diff is a very minor killer compared with poverty.</p> <p>The WHO report may have led to substantial features, with case studies of poor people but, as Rowntree reports, coverage of UK poverty is curiously anonymous. Data on poverty is presented more often than people's experiences of it (for overseas poverty, it's the other way round) and pictures are usually of \"experts\", not of poor people. The redtops, which normally personalise stories most, are least likely to write about poverty.</p> <p>I doubt any of this will surprise journalists. I cannot pretend that, when I later edited the IoS and the New Statesman, I behaved very differently from Glover. Poverty in Africa or Asia evokes sympathy, not least because people living on less than a dollar a day are often so visibly ill or hungry. UK poverty comes in less stark form and is therefore trickier.</p> <p>There ought to be ample opportunities for campaigning journalism, exposing, for example, the difficulties in obtaining benefits (contrary to newspaper myth), the employers who pay below the minimum wage, the loan sharks who get the poor deeper into debt. But newspaper readers are drawn mainly from more affluent sections of the population. They believe that, with university fees, rising petrol prices, care home costs and so on, they are having a tough time themselves. The Telegraph has brilliantly christened them the \"coping classes\", flattering its readers that, against enormous odds, they somehow get by, while others feebly succumb. The best newspaper stories allow readers to identify with the subjects. Nobody wants to identify with the uncoping poor. Rather, with their rowdy children, chaotic finances, unstable families, unhealthy eating habits and propensity to crime, they are models of how not to behave, and sometimes objects of fear or ridicule. </p> <p>Poor people, knowing the label \"poor\" signifies failure and inadequacy, don't want themselves, still less their children, to be pictured or written about. With the Media Trust and Society of Editors, Rowntree has also published \"a practical guide\" for journalists on reporting UK poverty. It explains how to define poverty, find information, avoid stereotypes and so on. All admirable stuff, complete with examples of pictures that can illustrate features. But the images of uneven stairs, boarded-up windows and threadbare washing would, I fear, still fail to persuade Glover and most other editors to take a Sunday morning walk.</p> <h2>No real cause for con-Cern</h2> <p>Newspapers, run mostly by men, have always liked big bangs and high speeds. So they were naturally interested in the opening of the Large Hadron Collider, which will propel particles at high speed round a tunnel under Geneva, and replicate conditions that existed just after the universe began. More interest was stirred by claims that the experiment could create black holes and swallow the earth.</p> <p>Nearly all papers, even the more usually credulous ones, treated this as a joke. Not the Daily Telegraph. Its columnist Gerald Warner, after mocking those who worry about global warming, complained that a legal case to stop the Geneva experiment was taking so long we faced \"dramatic consequences\" before it was resolved. He demanded \"an international authority, dominated by laymen\" to order \"sensible precautions\" before allowing such experiments to proceed. So, global warming is a silly scare story, but the LHC threatens doom. Regulation is usually bad, but now we need more of it. It is very hard to understand the Telegraph mind.</p> <p><strong>Indy breaks \u00a31 bar</strong></p> <p>It is brave of the Independent to become the first white paper to break the \u00a31 barrier for its weekday cover price. Roger Alton, the editor, has only been in post since July 1 and has still, understandably, to make a significant impact, though the presentation, particularly on comment pages, is much improved. With the arrival of full colour, I hear we may see more dramatic changes in the next week or so. They had better be good. The Independent, in fourth place in the highly competitive quality paper market, and with restricted marketing budgets, has to get itself talked about. It did this by eschewing coverage of the royals, by switching from broadsheet to tabloid, by announcing itself as a \"viewspaper\", and so on. What does Alton have up his sleeve?</p>",
  "<p>The words \"donuts\" and \"cutting edge\" are rarely seen in the same sentence. But in Buffalo, New York, an experiment that could shape shopping experiences in the future features the ring-shaped snacks. Two Dunkin' Donuts stores are about to start trialling a system that can scan your face and play an advert on a digital screen that is targeted to your age, gender and demographic group. </p> <p>This is the first time it has been used by a mainstream advertiser in the US and works in the same way as systems used by law enforcement and emigration agencies to spot criminals in crowds. A camera above a screen captures an image and analyses features such as the eyes, nose, jawline and cheekbones. The information is then used to select adverts to be played on the screen as you browse or pay at the checkout. </p> <p>\"It's in the region of 85% accurate, which is a very high level of precision for advertisers and marketers,\" says Barry Salzman, CEO of YCD Multimedia, which invented the display platform. \"What we're essentially doing is creating the retail environment of the future. Imagine you walk in and instead of seeing printed materials it's all digital screens.\" Those who have seen the movie Minority Report, in which Tom Cruise is tracked by adverts wherever he goes, won't have to imagine too hard. So are we destined for a future -some say it could be the norm in 20 years - where we are bombarded with personalised messages about deodorant and can't hide anywhere? </p> <p>\"That genie is out and there's no putting it back,\" said John Underkoffler, the science and technology adviser for the Spielberg film, when asked about all-pervasive displays in real life. </p> <p><strong>Pizza options</strong></p> <p>The Dunkin' Donuts stores that are about to start testing facial recognition are already using a system that displays an appropriate advert at the till according to what you buy. If you order coffee in the morning, you are reminded about hash browns or breakfast sandwiches. Procter and Gamble, meanwhile, is experimenting with radio (RFID) chips in its products that tell a display screen what you have bought when you pick it off the shelf. If you choose shampoo for dry hair, you will get to hear about a conditioner for the same hair type, for example. </p> <p>\"Around the same time the technology evolved, we were challenged by the fragmentation of traditional media,\" says Salzman. \"It's become increasingly difficult for advertisers to reach their target audiences on TV, so the retail outlet has become more important. It has become one of the most efficient means of reaching people. In 1996 it took three TV ads to reach 85% of women in America, in 2001 it took 100 TV ads and today it's impossible.\"</p> <p>Bart Weitz, the executive director at the centre for retailing education and research at the University of Florida, agrees. \"The real reason for these new technologies is because, in a number of merchandise categories, a tremendous percentage of decisions [about 70] is made in the store itself. Particularly with grocery products in supermarkets. The closer to the point of purchase you give a message, the stronger its impact.\" Advertisers can also log more carefully how effective their advertisements are, and what return they're getting, as the system is hooked up to inventory and other technologies that measure footfall and transactions. </p> <p>Weitz is not, however, so convinced of the effectiveness of selling using people's faces as a guide. \"Generally demographic characteristics are not that good an indicator of what people will buy,\" he says. \"A better predictor is what they've bought in the past, lifestyle, their underlying beliefs, what TV programmes they watch and so on.\" And others in the industry still don't trust facial recognition software, which has a history of confusing men and women.<br><strong><br>Privacy concerns</strong></p> <p>The system YCD and Dunkin' Donuts have been using does not store data from users, to avoid privacy concerns. Weitz thinks that an even more pervasive system is on the way. \"You'll have an RFID chip in your credit card and when you walk into a store they'll know exactly who you are,\" he says. \"They have the technology now - you can keep a chip on the end of your keychain and use it to pay for gas without going into the station. The next step is to just have it on you and combine it with the information many retailers already keep about you and your preferences on file. If you go to Amazon the first thing you see is a page targeted at you - in a sense they're going to start doing the same thing instore.\"</p> <p>Kalle Lasn is editor-in-chief of the anti-advertising Adbusters magazine. He thinks we are already exposed to too many messages, and that such a move may further reinforce harmful effects. \"I think that advertising has invaded our lives to the point where it's alarming,\" he says, \"and now with this sort of face recognition they're coming up with ever more powerful ways to target us. I feel mentally exhausted.\" </p> <p>Lasn believes we need to change the way we behave, consume less and reduce the quantity of messages we are exposed to. \"Advertising is so invasive and so powerful, it's really eroding our mental health. The human brain when it sees some message that is calculated to grab attention - something erotic, or eye-catching or violent - isn't really wired to ignore these things.\"</p> <h2>Coming to a shelf near you ...</h2> <p><strong>Point of purchase targeted advertising - samples from trial ...</strong></p> <p>\"Smile, <strong>REGULAR SHOPPER</strong> - you're on ScanCam.

  "<p>Barclays had sounded out key shareholders about supporting a possible cash call in the event that it succeeded in taking over the troubled US investment bank Lehman Brothers, which was last night teetering on the brink of collapse.</p> <p>In a sign of how advanced the talks had progressed in a matter of 72 hours, Barclays had been working on a number of ways of raising cash to bolster its negotiating position in one of the most dramatic twists yet in the ongoing credit crisis. But late last night Barclays abandoned its audacious move.</p> <p>It is thought that Barclays executives were hoping a cash call could be avoided so soon after a \u00a34.5bn fundraising that was shunned by most of its existing shareholders. Barclays, which had hired Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank to advise on the high-stakes talks, had also considered approaching a handful of big shareholders, or even managing to structure a deal using its own shares.</p> <p>From the outset, though, it was apparent that Barclays would only agree to take part in a takeover of the troubled institution if the US treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, sanctioned some form of guarantee for Lehman's bust balance sheet.</p> <p>Paulson, who the previous weekend had promised $200bn (\u00a3100bn) to shore up the home loan agencies Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, was thought by early evening London time to have refused to put more taxpayers' money aside to shore up an investment bank. It would have been even more politically sensitive for the US government to absorb losses only for Lehman to be acquired by a foreign bank.</p> <p>The US authorities had taken the extraordinary step in March of supporting JP Morgan's takeover with $30bn of public money. This is thought to have made it more difficult for either Barclays or Bank of America, which also entered talks to buy Lehman, to agree to any deal.</p> <p>Treasury officials have argued that Lehman's situation differs from that of Bear Stearns in two crucial aspects. The first is that the markets have known of the problems at Lehman for some time, which means they have had time to prepare. Secondly, the bank has access to the borrowing facility introduced by the Federal Reserve after Bear Stearns collapsed.</p> <p>Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, said the government could not continue to bail ailing financial firms out. \"It is very clear that this is an unsustainable situation in the financial markets,\" he said. \"We shouldn't try to protect every single institution. The ordinary course of financial changes has winners and losers.\"</p> <p>Barclays also faced the conundrum that even if it had decided to take on Lehman's liabilities, it would have needed to convene a shareholder meeting - something that would have proved impossible given the time available, and meant that any deal would not have received approval from the UK regulatory bodies.</p> <p>Early yesterday the US authorities had been hoping an answer to Lehman's woes could be found that would allow Barclays to buy the better performing parts of the bank and a group of 15 or so rivals to agree to carve off the more toxic assets and stomach losses that could have amounted to an estimated $30bn. But it proved tough to persuade rival banks to support a bailout that would require them to take losses and Barclays to potentially reap all the rewards.</p> <p>The discussions have also been hampered by the fact that the other banks on Wall Street are eager to preserve capital during the current crisis, instead of getting involved in a rescue of Lehman.</p> <p>Yesterday's meeting at the offices of the Federal Reserve was attended by senior Wall Street executives including Vikram Pandit, the boss of Citigroup; Jamie Dimon, who runs JP Morgan; John Mack from Morgan Stanley; Lloyd Blankfein, the head of Goldman Sachs, and John Thain, the boss of Merrill Lynch.</p> <p>The meetings are said to have covered not just Lehman, but the strength of other financial institutions as well. The markets clearly think there is trouble to come, with shares of American International Group, the largest insurance broker in the US, Washington Mutual, the largest US savings and loan association, and Merrill Lynch all coming under intense pressure last week.</p> <p>Late last night, it emerged that Bank of America had switched its attention from Lehman and was in talks to buy Merrill Lynch for around $40bn in shares. The talks with Bank of America appeared to be driven by a desire in Merrill Lynch to avoid the same fate as Lehman.</p> <p>Merrill Lynch's share price fell 38% in the wake of the troubles at Lehman, principally on fears that the investment bank has similar investments in property and residential mortgages. Analysts had also questioned the strength of Merrill's balance sheet.</p> <p>On Friday, the credit ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's warned that it might lower its rating on AIG because the precipitous fall in the insurer's share price - which fell by 45.7% last week - would make it more difficult to raise capital. The insurance broker has hired JP Morgan to help it raise cash and was planning a conference call for analysts this morning to keep a lid on the growing concerns. Among the measures being considered are some sales of assets.</p> <p>Lehman said last week it lost $3.9bn in the third quarter after taking huge write-downs. Among emergency measures outlined it said it intended to spin off most of its commercial property assets worth about $30bn, into a separate company.</p> <h2>Profile: Richard Fuld</h2> <p>He is known as the Gorilla, in reference to his reputation as one of the toughest guys on Wall Street. Richard Fuld the chief executive of Lehman Brothers, joined the firm as an intern in 1969, and worked his way up from the trading floor. He has the classic image of a Wall Street banker. The New York Times, described him as a \"trader's trader ... with an athletic physique, intense focus and penchant for profanity\". In the middle of last week, as he unveiled a plan to steer Lehman Brothers through its current crisis, Fuld told investors that the beleaguered investment bank had faced adversity before and each time emerged stronger.</p> <p>Fuld, 62, had good reason for his confidence. He had brought Lehman back from the brink many times before. He led the firm after it was spun out of American Express at a time when many thought it was too small to retain its independence; and restored its fortunes after it was brought low by the collapse of the hedge fund Long Term Capital Management in 1998.</p> <p>When the Lehman offices were destroyed in the September 11 attacks, the firm took over a Sheraton hotel, replacing beds with desks. Fuld, who took the reins at Lehman in 1994, is one of the longest-serving chief executives on Wall Street and is said to inspire strong loyalty among his staff. He likes to say that he bleeds green, a reference to the firm's corporate colour. Lehman has made him a very rich man. Last year he earned $40m but his value on paper has fallen this week - he owns more than 2% of the firm's shares. He has a business degree from the University of Colorado and an MBA from New York's Stern School of Business.<br><strong>David Teather</strong></p>",
  "<p>Global banks will have to raise at least $350bn (\u00a3195bn) in fresh capital to recoup their losses from the credit crunch, the head of the Financial Stability Forum (FSF) warned at the weekend.</p> <p>Mario Draghi, Italy's central bank governor and FSF chairman, said the protracted turmoil on financial markets would plunge more banks into difficulties and force the pace of consolidation in the sector.</p> <p>His comments, at an informal meeting of EU finance ministers and central bank governors, came as reports said the Swiss bank UBS, the biggest European casualty of the sub-prime crisis, would write off a further $5bn this year.</p> <p>UBS has already written down about $43bn, while global banks have suffered write-downs and losses of $350bn in the past year. Of these, \u20ac120bn have been absorbed by European banks, which may account for half of the estimated $1tn of asset-backed securities issued by banks.</p> <p>Draghi told reporters that banks had already raised $350bn to counter the crunch and would need to raise at least as much, if not more, in future - a figure far higher than previously anticipated.</p> <p>\"Various banks, within a sector that is basically well capitalised overall, will be in difficulty,\" he said. \"The conclusion is that there will be a series of consolidations in the world banking system.\"</p> <p>Over the weekend, the former US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan said the credit crunch was \"a once-in-a-half-century, probably once-in-a-century type of event\" and called it the worst \"by far\" in his career.</p> <p>\"There's no question that this is in the process of outstripping anything I've seen, and it still is not resolved and it still has a way to go. And indeed, it will continue to be a corrosive force until the price of homes in the US stabilises. That will induce a series of events around the globe which will stabilise the system,\" he added. His best guess for that happening was in early 2009.</p> <p>Draghi, meanwhile, insisted that banks in the 15-strong eurozone were not as exposed to reckless lending as others but the severe troubles at Northern Rock and several German banks have prompted serious concerns among EU policymakers.</p> <p>The EU finance ministers and central bank governors, dominated by fears of contagion from the potential insolvency of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers, met to agree on new rules to regulate and supervise European banks. But sharp differences soon emerged.</p> <p>Christine Lagarde, the French finance minister who chaired the \"ecofin\" meeting, said ministers had agreed that a single reporting system for banks and insurance companies would be in place by 2012. But this was disputed by EU diplomats.</p> <p>The EU does, however, want banks and insurance companies to give full details of their exposure to securitised assets and any liquidity problems by the time they report their first-quarter figures next year. Common guidelines are due to be adopted soon. Lagarde said 80% had so far complied but 100% transparency was required to restore confidence among investors. </p> <p>\"It is vital to enhance work on the valuation of assets, particularly where the current market is still illiquid,\" she said.</p> <p>A French paper calling for a fresh group of senior financial officials to draw up new proposals for valuing asset-backed securities - more sophisticated than the current \"mark to market\" process - is understood to have met with a dusty response.</p> <p>Alistair Darling, chancellor of the exchequer, questioned the need for fresh discussions, instead he urged action on implementing the \"roadmap\" set by the EU last autumn. </p> <p>Peer Steinbr\u00fcck, the German finance minister, backed Darling's intervention in favour of sticking to the proposals for a global approach to stricter supervision established by the FSF.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown faced a growing mutiny from his own MPs today, while members of the cabinet including potential successor David Miliband rallied round to support him.</p> <p>The foreign secretary insisted he disagreed with rebel demands for a leadership contest, but he said the government, from the prime minister down, was aware of the \"scale of the problem\" it faced in winning over its critics and recognised it was dealing with \"very, very challenging times\".</p> <p>Members of the cabinet took to the airwaves after Labour rebels warned that dozens more were expected to join a campaign to destabilise the prime minister ahead of next week's Labour conference. </p> <p>The former minister Frank Field, one of the rebel MPs, accused the party's high command of leaking their requests for leadership nomination papers in an attempt to \"smash\" their campaign of dissent.</p> <p>The chief whip, Geoff Hoon, denied leaking the story. He also rejected calls for a leadership contest, telling BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend: \"I simply don't think at this stage it's appropriate. I think it's a distraction.\"</p> <p><strong>Brown 'will still be PM by Christmas'</strong> </p> <p>He said he was \"absolutely confident\" that Brown would still be prime minister by Christmas because he was focused on dealing with the difficult issues currently facing the country. </p> <p>Junior whip Siobhain McDonagh was the first to break ranks on Friday and was promptly sacked for claiming that the only way to restore order and confidence in the party was to call a leadership contest. </p> <p>Joan Ryan was yesterday dismissed from her post as Labour vice-chair and as Brown's special envoy to Cyprus after she called for a leadership contest.</p> <p>Former government members Peter Kilfoyle, George Howarth, Fiona Mactaggart, Greg Pope and Janet Anderson also made it known they want a challenge. </p> <p>In an interview with BBC Radio Five Live, Miliband said he respected the rebels' views, adding: \"That doesn't mean you've got to agree with them, and I don't agree with them that there should be a leadership election.</p> <p>\"But I do think that, from the top down, from Gordon down, we know the scale of the challenge, and that is important.\"</p> <p>Asked whether Brown would be in charge at the next general election, Miliband replied: \"Of course.\"</p> <p><strong>Hutton refuses to condemn rebels</strong></p> <p>John Hutton, the business secretary, took a softly-softly approach to the growing list of dissenting MPs but stressed that the party ought to present a unified front.</p> <p>\"I am absolutely not going to condemn any of my colleagues who want that debate but I think we have to support the government and we have to support the work we are doing because it is absolutely the right direction for the country,\" he told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show. </p> <p>Hutton added that colleagues were right to say that the government needed to \"do better\".</p> <p>Hutton said: \"For goodness sake, we are 20 points behind in the opinion polls. But we have to do better and make our arguments clear and that is what we are trying to do.\"</p> <p>The environment secretary, Hilary Benn, also called for MPs to get behind the prime minister.</p> <p>\"We should be backing Gordon Brown, who was chosen overwhelmingly by the party last year,\" he told Sky News. \"He's the right man for the job.\"</p> <p>A number of MPs are expected to join the campaign against Brown over the coming days. Other MPs, including former cabinet ministers, are believed to be working with the rebels. </p> <p><strong>'The problem is lack of clarity'</strong></p> <p>Mactaggart, a former Home Office minister, said in an interview on today's Politics Show: \"I think we should give a chance to someone else to take over, I really do.\"</p> <p>\"The problem is a lack of clarity about what our ambitions are. It is so depressing when you look at the Conservatives. They are reacting to any agenda we have set and suddenly we are reacting to their agenda. We do not need to.\" </p> <p>Other rebels used a series of newspaper articles to express their concerns. </p> <p><strong>'Timorous political manoeuvres'</strong></p> <p>Former minister Barry Gardiner, a special envoy on forestry for the prime minister, confirmed that he had requested leadership nomination papers be sent out to all Labour MPs. Downing Street later said he had been \"relieved of his responsibilities\" as a consequence.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article4748530.ece\">an article for the Sunday Times</a>, he said that the cabinet contained \"many other\" politicians apart from Brown who possessed the sound judgment and vision that the country needed. He accused the prime minister of \"vacillation, loss of international credibility and timorous political manoeuvres that the public cannot understand\".</p> <p>Backbench rebel Graham Stringer added his support for a leadership campaign <a href=\"http://www.mailonsunday.co.uk/news/article-1055621/It-time-say-MPs-think--leadership-election-says-Graham-Stringer-Labour-MP.html\">in an article in the Mail on Sunday</a>. </p> <p>Describing the \"despair\" felt by many within the parliamentary party, the MP for Manchester Blackley wrote: \"It is simply not true to claim that the desire for Gordon to go is not representative of the majority view of the party members. If Gordon believes that, then he is more woefully out of touch and disconnected from our core supporters than I had thought.\"</p> <p>In the News of the World, Howarth, a former Home Office minister, <a href=\"http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/news/article25727.ece\">urged Brown</a> to \"give somebody else a chance\". </p> <p>He writes: \"I am not sure whether Gordon can regain the public's trust and confidence.

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>2.45 PM:</strong> Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg is set to field questions from a few of the 6,000 delegates who have congregated in Bournemouth for the party's annual conference. </p> <p>Chaired by Steve Richards of the Independent, Clegg faces the daunting task of fielding any questions, on any topic put to him by delegates. Ahead of his first party conference as leader, Clegg has given his party a bit of a jumpstart by signalling plans for tax cuts for low and middle income earners, as well as two measures to close tax loopholes on the super rich. </p> <p>The proposals are part of Clegg's discussion paper on the party's direction, Make it Happen, which is due to be debated by conference tomorrow. This afternoon should give Clegg an opportunity to flesh out his ideas, and give us a sense of what delegates are thinking. </p> <p>Also on the platform watching on will be Duncan Brack, federal conference committee chair.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>2.50 PM:</strong> We kick start with questions from Richards to the Lib Dem leader.</p> <p>In what ways is Clegg different from his two predecessors, asks Richards? He is referring to Sir Menzies Campbell, and Charles Kennedy.</p> <p>Clegg says that he doesn't believe in pulling his punches in his description of the Labour government. Eleven years ago they promised a fairer society, and what is clear is that trying to do it all from the centre didn't work.</p> <p>Yes, says Richards, but your predecessors would have probably said the same. Do you describe yourself as left of centre?</p> <p>Clegg says: \"We are a liberal party\".</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>2.55 PM:</strong> A question from a delegate called Linda Jacks. Are Clegg's tax plans \"Cameron lite?\" Ouch.</p> <p>Clegg embarks on an attack on David Cameron's own tax and spend proposals. They only relate to the privileged and the wealthy, with the hope that they might trickle down to ordinary people, he says. \"I don't think people should be trickled on,\" he says to applause.</p> <p>Outlining his plans to close tax avoidance loopholes, and making sure that the rest of us don't pay our taxes twice to support these loopholes means the Lib Dems are the party that has the \"fairest\" approach to tax.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>3.00 PM:</strong> Once money is allocated to some of the Lib Dems' policies to improve, say housing and education, the cash left over should be handed back to the people who have been paying proportionally more in tax than the wealthy. \"It is so obvious to me we should be on the side of these people,\" he says. More applause. \"And David Cameron would never say that!\"</p> <p>Richards asks him about the sums. Clegg says one part is redirecting \u00a320bn and then handing back some money to the less well-off. Clegg says the aim will be to meet spending priorities and then not spend it again. Is that on top of \u00a320bn spending cuts, asks Richards. Yes, says Clegg.</p> <p>Richards asks Clegg whether he thinks his plans are clear, since journalists aren't getting this. (The implications are that if they aren't, then the wider electorate isn't likely to either.)</p> <p>Clegg says more questions are bringing issues to the fore. He doesn't mind that. Clegg says: identify \u00a320bn, identify priorities, use any money left over to fund tax cuts. </p> <p>He goes on to talk about things the Lib Dems plan to scrap, such as the child trust fund and the ID cards scheme. The road building programme, too. \"We have already taken the difficult decisions needed to take forward this exercise,\" he says.</p> <p>Another delegate - a professor - asks about environmental policies. Will they be central to the next election manifesto?</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>3.00 PM:</strong> Clegg confesses he's a bit unnerved when he hears the word \"professor\".</p> <p>He goes on to talk about the need to make the environment a core electoral concern. Fuel poverty is a classic example about how to be radical about this issue. </p> <p>The windfall subsidies that could come from the profits of energy companies could help with energy preservation (insulation measures) of the future. He makes it clear he doesn't see the environment as a side salad issue, but definitely part of the main course.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>3.05 PM:</strong> Richards steers Clegg onto the economy. </p> <p>Clegg criticises the short-termist, \"greedy\" bonus culture that has led us to this point (applause).</p> <p>Richards asks whether in light of the unrecognisable economic climate, will the Lib Dems' tax plans - for example on green tax - be revised?</p> <p>Clegg says the economic downturn makes an economic case for bottom-up tax cuts to stimulate demand in a stagnant economy.</p> <p>He says the Lib Dems are ahead of the curve on a number of issues that would help the current situation.</p> <p>Richards then asks whether petrol prices should be higher? Clegg points out it's the volatility of petrol prices that is a problem. </p> <p>The approach the Lib Dems are advocating is to do it differently by internalising the costs of damaging the economy: national road pricing, for example.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>3.15 PM:</strong> On to the euro. Richards says the party backed the euro before, but what about now?</p> <p>Clegg says the Lib Dem position is absolutely unchanged. We should enter the euro \"when the time is right\" and it should be subject to a referendum. </p> <p>He says his Treasury spokesman, Vince Cable, said the same thing, which is that it's not on the Lib Dem radar \"right now\".</p> <p>The debate on currency consolidation will come back, he says.</p> <p>Richards then asks about the referendum on the EU treaty vote in the Commons, where not everyone in the Lib Dem parliamentary party agreed with Clegg's line. </p> <p>The Lib Dem leader says he remains of the view that those calling for a referendum on the treaty betray a hostility to the EU, and that they should be called to account. (Clegg, a Europhile, wanted a referendum on membership of the EU as a whole, rather than the treaty.)</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>3.20 PM:</strong> Clegg is asked about the Tories again. The Lib Dem leader says they are talking the talk but not necessarily walking the walk. </p> <p>He says just because the Tories are using \"our words\" we must not be pushed off from using them. In other words, David Cameron is stealing the Liberal Democrats' clothes, rather than Clegg stealing Tory clothes (with the tax cut policy).</p> <p>He says Cameron \"describes himself as a sort of cuddly toy\".</p> <p>Clegg is asked: if he retired in 15-20 years time, what would he most like to see in place? Clegg says what he would like to see is a fairer society which is less segregated. If his policies were adopted tomorrow, people at the bottom would have been given the steps necessary to close the gap between rich and poor.</p> <p>He would also like to look back and see a change in the political landscape. He nods to his ambitions to double the number of Lib Dems in parliament. And he would also like a different approach to the EU and international matters. </p> <p>That's three, says Clegg, and of course you'll ask, \"What about the environment and other things?\" he says to the audience. He seems worried that he won't have pleased everyone with that answer.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>3.20 PM:</strong> Now on to a thorny question, lobbed by Richards. What if there is a hung parliament and Clegg has to work with another party?</p> <p>Clegg says, not for the first time, that he doesn't spend much time thinking about the possibility of a coalition. He's concentrating on offering a real choice to voters, rather than muddying the waters by thinking about who he might be working with. </p> <p>You have to see what the voters say they want first, and you shouldn't second guess them, he says.</p> <p>A question from a female delegate about work-life balance. Since \"the stork is on the way\" (the Cleggs are expecting their third child), is Clegg going to take some paternity leave? </p> <p>Amazed that the young delegate still believes that the arrival of a newborn involves a stork, Clegg reassures her he will be doing so. If you give him the choice between reading a book to his kids or staying late at work, \"it's a no-brainer\", he says.</p> <p>But he admits it still isn't easy for politicians. \"We have a long way to go to humanise politics,\" he says, to applause.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>3.25 PM:</strong> A nice easy one to end with. Richards asks him if he enjoys the public side of leadership, such as this Q&amp;A session. Clegg says yes, bar the odd moment. Cue applause as a clearly relieved Nick Clegg smiles to his audience.</p>",
  "<p><strong><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/profile/conorfoley\"><br>Conor Foley</a> to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/lauryn-oates\">Lauryn Oates</a></strong></p> <p>The <a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5irC6s76C8mju6RDRz9y-FtFxuRag\">recent call</a> by the Afghan government for a \"re-negotiation\" of agreements regulating the presence of international troops in Afghanistan after the killing of up to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/26/afghanistan.usa\">90 civilians</a> in US-led air strikes is the latest sign of a broader failure of western strategy.</p> <p>We have both worked in Afghanistan and probably share the same analysis of what went wrong: the lack of a credible international peacekeeping force at the beginning, the co-option of warlords and gangsters into the state apparatus, the diversion of international attention by the US invasion of Iraq and the counter-productive nature of its blatantly illegal \"war on terror\". The question now is what to do next and I can only see two options.</p> <p>The first option is to continue with the current strategy of hoping that a combination of military force and bribery can defeat the anti-government insurgency. The second is for negotiations leading to a broader-based government in Afghanistan, underwritten by regional agreements with Iran and Pakistan, and appropriate guarantees from the international community.</p> <p>President Karzai has already offered the Taliban a place in government if they end their military campaign and accept the constitution. They continue to insist that the withdrawal of western troops is a prerequisite for negotiations. </p> <p>We know that there are deep splits both within the ranks of the insurgency and, of course, within the government itself. Last year Karzai <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article3107632.ece\">expelled</a> Michael Semple and Mervyn Patterson, two of the international community's most experienced diplomats, for allegedly opening a line of communication to the insurgents. Humanitarian aid organisations can now only operate in many areas with the Taliban's tacit approval.</p> <p>A negotiated settlement will neither be pleasant nor easy, but I do not see any other alternatives. If you have got any I would love to hear them.<br> <strong><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/profile/laurynoates\">Lauryn Oates</a> to Conor Foley</strong></p> <p>While I believe we both share a genuine concern about the prospects for peace in Afghanistan, we diverge over the minimum principles that must form the parameters for dealing with the Taliban.</p> <p>For starters, the Taliban are a misogynist band of illiterate, xenophobic thugs. They legalised and encouraged stoning women to death as punishment for prostitution or adultery. They massacred <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazara_people\">Hazaras</a>. They took authoritarianism to new levels, making the Spanish inquisition look like a walk in the park. Even attempting to meet the basic needs of their subjects was far down on their list of priorities, somewhere well below banning images of living things and outlawing musical instruments. </p> <p>There is a stark difference between recognising the sovereignty of an elected government, and condoning behaviour from an illegal armed group which violates nearly every single article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Karzai's government is indeed corrupt and deeply flawed. But it is also elected. And while Afghan women and girls continue to live with a plethora of problems rooted in patriarchal traditions and insecurity, there are also millions of girls in schools, where once the only girls' classrooms were clandestine home schools. </p> <p>That's a start, and it's one that must be given more of a chance before negotiating with the likes of the Taliban. This is not Iraq. There is a foundation here to build upon, and that's another point on which we diverge. You cite a failure of \"western strategy\". Part of that strategy, which is hardly only \"western\" is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan_Compact\">Afghanistan Compact</a>, deriving from the initial Bonn Agreement, and it has led to vast improvements in development and to a democratically elected government.</p> <p>Power-sharing of any kind with the Taliban is a slippery slope, I have heard little mention of any guarantees of women's rights. They tend to be the very first thing negotiated out. Perhaps more importantly, there is <a href=\"http://afghanistan-canada-solidarity.org/links/weblink/17\">little evidence</a> that Afghans are prepared to tolerate the medieval governance methods of the Taliban again. Who are we to contribute to installing an unpopular extremist militia of fascists in a country screaming for democracy?</p> <p>It's time to stop romanticising the idea that what the Taliban stand for is even remotely acceptable to Afghans, especially to women, and to call for more from Nato, not less. Afterall, would you (or your wife or sister) be fine with having some Taliban seats in your House of Commons?</p> <p><strong>Conor to Lauryn</strong></p> <p>Since the Taliban have murdered several of my friends, kidnapped others, bombed my organisation's office and narrowly missed killing me, I am hardly likely to romanticise what they stand for. This is not a contest for who dislikes them most!<br> It is not me that has offered them a place in the government. A year ago President Karzai said he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/oct/02/thereturnofthetaliban\">wanted to meet</a> Mullah Omar and Gulbuddin Hekmatya for face-to-face talks and that \"If a group of Taliban or a number of Taliban come to me and say, 'President, we want a department in this or in that ministry or we want a position as deputy minister ... and we don't want to fight any more ...' If there will be a demand and a request like that to me, I will accept it because I want conflicts and fighting to end in Afghanistan.\" The main opposition have also called for political talks and the Afghan parliament has already voted to give Hekmatya an amnesty.</p> <p>The Taliban responded to Karzai's offer by saying that they would not even begin to negotiate while foreign troops remain in the country and until they have some guarantees about the international community's intentions. A Taliban spokesperson <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSISL26606720070930\">stated</a>: \"On the one hand, America has put our leader's name on a wanted persons list and is calling us terrorists; and on the other hand, Karzai is talking about peace talks. It's a joke.\"</p> <p>We know that the anti-government insurgency is not a homogenous grouping and that the government is also deeply split. This creates a number of challenges, but also opportunities, for the international community.</p> <p>The failure of western strategy that I referred to dates back to the period immediately after the fall of the Taliban and encompasses a range of mistakes from the decision to limit the size of the <a href=\"http://www.nato.int/ISAF/index.html\">International Security Assistance Force</a> (Isaf), to the initial US reluctance to become involved in nation-building, to the demonisation of Iran and the indulgence of Pakistan's military dictatorship. We warned at the time of the dangers of Pashtun alienation and the carte blanche being given to the Northern Alliance. You can read <a href=\"http://www.minorityrights.org/?lid=863\">a briefing</a> I wrote here five years ago and many articles since. I take no pleasure in being <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/dec/10/afghanistan.comment\">proved right</a> in retrospect.</p> <p>But my previous question you is the same. Do you see an alternative to the two options that I outlined, and if not, which one of them would you prefer?</p> <p>Incidentally, you asked how I would feel about people whose political views I despised being elected to the British House of Commons. But surely that is what democracy is all about.</p> <p><strong>Lauryn to Conor</strong></p> <p>Firstly, let me clarify that conceding power to a plague of bloodthirsty, heavily-armed fanatics and criminals is not \"what democracy is all about\". A power-sharing agreement whereby the Taliban find themselves in charge of a ministry, a few provinces, or a government without being elected into power, is hardly progress. Should the Taliban drop their weapons, form an unarmed political group, come up with an enticing platform, and be voted into government by male and female voters in free and fair elections, then their power would be legitimate. In the meantime, the consequences of your vaguely plotted out Option 2 are fairly predictable, and precisely the opposite of a solution. </p> <p>What makes you believe the Taliban will stick to their promises? That all they want is to see foreign troops withdrawn and then they will happily accept the constitution, women in parliament, girls in school, and the presence of foreign organizations building roads and health clinics \u2013 the foreign organisations where your friends and mine who were murdered were working? As the International Crisis Group rightly <a href=\"http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=5593\">points out</a>, while \"negotiations are credible and acceptable if they help resolve conflict and save lives, that will not be the case in Afghanistan's current environment.\"</p> <p>The notion that there are only two options is utterly false. Your second option contains the typically vague parameters such as \"a broader-based government\" (meaning with unelected representation from the loathed Taliban?), \"underwritten by regional agreements with Iran and Pakistan\" (the same Pakistan that helped arm the Taliban to take over Afghanistan in the first place? The same Iran that is currently a theocracy?), and \"appropriate guarantees from the international community\" (even if we ignore the Taliban's characteristic disregard for what the international community thinks or wants, what exactly are the mechanisms here? How will they be enforced?)</p> <p>There are other options. These include robustly addressing Pakistan's various roles in fuelling this conflict, countering the Taliban's propaganda machine, protecting communities where the Taliban forcibly recruit or the ones where they pay villagers to murder foreigners or threaten them from accepting western aid, fighting corruption in the government, supporting demobilisation and amnesty programmes for ex-insurgents, getting more Nato troops into southern Afghanistan immediately, and continuing to implement all goals of the Afghanistan Compact. In particular, alleviating poverty and fighting onwards with micro-credit schemes, building schools, opening universities and supporting farmers will snuff out some of root causes of violence in Afghanistan. This is the only course \u2013 it's a three-steps-forward, one-step-back sort of progress, but it must be given a chance. </p> <p>Finally, a question back to you: why is \"war on terror\" in parentheses but not the ludicrous term \"anti-government insurgency\"? What this war is really about, which you won't acknowledge, is a fascist war against women, an illegal war against international aid in the form of medicine, food, roads, and textbooks, and a primitive but a well-financed religious war against modernity itself. It's a war worth fighting, and particularly when Afghans are asking us to do so.</p> <p><strong>Conor to Lauryn</strong></p> <p>I am not sure why you find the term \"anti-government insurgents\" ludicrous \u2013 it is a fairly standard one used by the UN, Nato, the Afghan Human Rights Commission and the government itself. The power-sharing deal to which you are so opposed also comes from Afghanistan's democratically-elected president.</p> <p>You started by arguing that we should \"recognise the sovereignty of an elected government\", but now seem to be denying its right to conclude a peace agreement. The thought of a Taliban minister in charge of education or social affairs turns my stomach, but I have as much right to tell Afghans how to run their own country as I have to tell Canadians how to administer Quebec.</p> <p>The difference, of course, is that the government of Afghanistan cannot survive without international military backing and the problem, which even the International Crisis Group (ICG) concedes, is that it is currently offering negotiations from a position of weakness. Now that is a terrible indictment of the international community and the US government in particular. Having ousted the Taliban at the end of 2001, President Bush actively opposed expanding Isaf or involving US forces in nation-building. Both policies were subsequently reversed, but only after the seeds of the current insurgency had been sown.</p> <p>The number of international troops in Afghanistan has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/22/barackobama.afghanistan\">scaled up rapidly</a> in the last few years. I agree that these should be increased further. The whole country needs to be secured and it was the failure to do this from the beginning that created the conditions for the Taliban's subsequent rise.</p> <p>What you are proposing is a continuation of the current strategy \u2013 although I would be interested to learn what you mean by a \"more robust approach\" to Pakistan, given that everything short of invasion has been tried. The alternative is peace talks and I cannot predict their outcome since that would be for the parties themselves to decide.</p> <p>What the international community can do is support that process. As the ICG acknowledges, the immovable object at the moment is the attitude of the current US government, but that will change in November and presidential elections are also scheduled next year in Afghanistan. The various candidates will probably campaign on a \"peace talks\" platform because that is what most Afghan people appear to want.</p> <p>A new US government could help \u2013 or at least stop hindering \u2013 the process, by closing Guantanamo Bay, and other facilities, through which so many Afghans have been ghosted and in which many have been tortured. A recognition that the \"military victories\" of offensive operations are being more than offset by the damage caused to \"hearts and minds\" would also be welcome. Sidelining Iran has not been helpful and listening to the elected government of Pakistan \u2013 rather than its shadowy military leaders \u2013 would be useful. </p> <p><strong>Lauryn to Conor</strong></p> <p>The elected Afghan government has indeed reached out to the Taliban \u2013 and the Taliban wholly rejected the overture, except under conditions which the government could only reject. That strategy has been attempted more than once before; it's time to move on. Your proposal failed with the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people in the seven long years between 1994 and 2001, when the UN and the \"international community\" wasted everyone's time brokering truces that never lasted, all in aid of bringing the \"warring factions\" to the table around a negotiated solution. If there is any lesson at all in any of this, it is that talking truce with fascists is a failed idea. </p> <p>I am by no means proposing a continuation of the current strategy, as you claim. I have indicated several avenues for action in addition to Nato's continuing (and hopefully, expanding) presence. </p> <p>As for launching a more robust approach to Pakistan, I would start by pointing out the ongoing problem of the porous border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Wearing a burqa, I once walked right across the border with a nary a soul checking my identification. More importantly, there is the largely unaddressed complicity of former and current Pakistani ISI agents in supporting the Taliban, and the continued operation of Taliban training camps in Pakistan. Indeed, many Afghan friends have told me they believe that Nato should also be in Pakistan. </p> <p>There are also other issues which demand long-term solutions, such as addressing the root causes of militant Islamic radicalism in Pakistan, by reforming their education system, alleviating poverty and restricting the activities of radical groups. Why a robust strategy? The answer can be found in the death tolls inside both Afghanistan and Pakistan: Pakistan is one of the <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/crt/2007/103709.htm\">largest sources</a> of terrorist attacks in the world, with terrorism-caused deaths there doubled during 2006-2007.</p> <p>Your letters suggest that you condemn the Taliban for their atrocities committed against Afghans and foreigners alike, yet you imply that you are willing to tolerate a course of action that would potentially see them once again governing the Afghan people. </p> <p>Let's be frank here and imagine what a Talibanised government would look like. If you need some visual stimulation, you can watch <a href=\"http://www.rawa.us/movies/movies1.html\">tapes</a> of the Taliban shooting a woman in the head, carrying out public hangings with cranes, slitting a man's throat, or beating a woman on the streets. </p> <p>You say you that you have no right to tell Afghans how to run their country, yet you are advocating a position which poses some very real threats to prospects for peace and human rights in their country. I hope you are prepared to take responsibility for that position, should the time come. I also hope you are indeed serious when you say you could tolerate Taliban members in your own parliament. Because, if not, your argument ultimately comes down to being one seeped in cultural relativism and isolationism \u2013 leaving the citizens of other countries to their own devices in the face of threats from a violent, extremist, undemocratic force with a record for <a href=\"http://hrw.org/english/docs/1998/11/01/afghan1424.html\">committing crimes</a> against humanity.</p> <p>In the same vein, the term \"anti-government insurgents\" is ludicrous in the specific context of the failed \"power-sharing\" approach that you say should be revived and imposed upon the Afghan people with the collusion of Iran and Pakistan, with the \"international community\" serving as some sort of head waiter to the proceedings. The ludicrousness stems from deftly avoiding the ahistorical and illogical core of your proposal. It obscures what the Taliban really are, and what they really want. They want to plunge Afghanistan back into a nightmarish seventh century dystopia, and to slaughter everyone who has stood in the way of their savage vision these past seven years.</p> <p>If your primary concern were really with Afghanistan's sovereign and democratic rights, it would follow that sharing power with the Taliban would be most peacefully and effectively achieved by seeing to it that they put the gun down and campaign for public office at elections like everyone else.</p> <p><strong>Conor to Lauryn</strong></p> <p>As this is my final letter I would like to sketch out what I think could positively be done by the international community to help Afghanistan. Hopefully we will agree on at least some of the points.</p> <p>First of all, I agree, again, on the need for more troops on the ground. The over-reliance on airstrikes is one of the main reason for the spike in civilian casualties. The US and Nato reviewed their rules of engagement over a year ago, after a similar tragedy to the one that we have just witnessed in Azizabad, and the civilian death toll dropped for six months until the arrival of new American commanders. Personally I support the government of Afghanistan in their calls for a re-negotiation of the international military mandate.</p> <p>Secondly, I think we agree that this war is not going to be won by purely military means. The strategy of pouring aid into areas that are not under effective government control has been expensive and unsuccessful. The recent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/04/afghanistan.military\">massive operation</a> at the Kajaki dam, for example, just gives the Taliban another target to attack. The slower and less glamorous task is to increase the capacity of Afghanistan's own police and army and to establish a functioning judicial system capable of holding its national institutions to account. The International Criminal Court could play a useful role here, in tackling some of the \"untouchables\", although that would require a big change in attitude by the US government.</p> <p>Thirdly, the UN mission needs to continue scaling up its own presence. The \"light footprint\" approach was a failure and it would have been better to have given it executive powers, from the beginning, <a href=\"http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521888239\">drawing on the lessons</a> from Bosnia, East Timor and Sierra Leone. As you say, the Taliban has rejected proposals for talks, except under unacceptable conditions, but I think it is likely that some elements within the insurgency (I use this term entirely neutrally) may one day sign up for talks. We disagree on what approach to take to this scenario, but the UN has had some successes transitioning countries through peace processes. I have worked in many countries which are better places as a result.</p> <p>We also disagree about what approach to take to Pakistan \u2013 at least if you agree with those who are calling for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/05/pakistan.usa\">Nato attacks</a> inside the country. I do agree with the points you make about the porous border and the probable support that the ISI is providing to the insurgents (more to Hekmatyar than Mullah Omar, I would guess). However, Pakistan now has a democratic government and we must respect its sovereignty. We have a common interest in working with the people of Pakistan to counter the influence of the Taliban in their own country, but we cannot impose things on them from the outside.</p> <p>Finally, we agree that the international community should not abandon Afghanistan again, as it did in the 1990s, when the result was anarchy and civil war. A \"troops out\" position, in the absence of a political settlement, would be an utter disaster and could well lead to the type of scenario that you so graphically describe. </p> <p>Stay safe and best wishes for the future,</p> <p><strong>Lauryn to Conor</strong></p> <p>I am glad we both agree that an infusion of Isaf troops is urgently needed. I also believe that furthering the rule of law needs to be at the top of the list and that war crimes need to be prosecuted regardless of whether the perpetrators are in the government or not. I also firmly support professionalising and growing the police force, and I am deeply concerned that it is the US military who are training the police for the most part, rather than police training police. This will result in paramilitaries rather than community protectors which is what Afghan communities need after decades of not being able to trust the police. </p> <p>But development projects, large and small, are equally important. They will always be at risk. And they will always serve as critical investments into infrastructure and poverty alleviation. Poverty, being part of what draws the desperate and disfranchised to the Taliban, cannot afford to be left until security is achieved because security and development are fundamentally linked \u2013 something you probably also saw in the other societies recovering from conflict where you've spent time.</p> <p>All of this is about working away at the Afghanistan Compact goals, but this demands a big attitude shift by those animated by such pessimism and dreariness that they can see no way forward in Afghanistan without accommodating the likes of the Taliban.</p> <p>These are important discussions, but I think we need to wrap up by getting back to your central argument, which is that the \"only alternative\" to Afghanistan's agony is to bring the Taliban back into power by inviting it to some sort of banquet hosted by Pakistan and Iran, with the \"international community\" as the foot waiters, after the Taliban presumably kiss and make-up with Karzai and the countless Afghan \"collaborators\" and \"puppets\" they had vowed to annihilate. You may not like the way I word it, but this is the ugly side of your second, favoured option outlined in your first letter. The Taliban are clear: no negotiations without a withdrawal of Nato troops; and you are clear that you favour negotiations: \"I do not see any other alternatives\". </p> <p>And I will also return to my counter argument that it is preposterous to conclude that there are only two possible options. Indeed, many action points well beyond your Option 1, the status quo, have been fleshed out even in our own brief correspondence. No one has ever said that military means alone will win the war. </p> <p>I'll close with one last bit of evidence for the ahistorical folly of Taliban-appeasing which comes in your presumption that \"some elements\" of the Taliban \"may one day sign up for talks.\" The evidence is twofold. The first is that more than 50,000 \"insurgents\" have already been reconciled with the Afghan government. They surrendered and participated in rehabilitation and reintegration programs under the UN \u2013 this has been going on for years. The second is that if there are elements of the remaining hardcore Taliban leadership that may one day \"sign up for talks,\" it will only be because the alternative they face is death, either at the hands of Afghan or Isaf troops. </p> <p>In the meantime, the only thing to negotiate with the Taliban is their surrender. Their surrender would be a triumph for human rights, for internationalism and for progress; and as a believer in these things, I know which side I'm on.</p>",
  "<p>The Liberal Democrats have the opportunity to carve out a foreign policy that will meet the great challenges of our time, distinguish the party clearly and sharply from the positions of New Labour and the Tories, and be based on core liberal values. We call this approach progressive realism. It is founded on the realisation that climate change and the issues associated with it form the greatest challenge to the survival of our civilisation, and that all other policies must therefore be framed with this in mind. </p> <p><strong>Living within the natural limits of the earth</strong></p> <p>The era of cheap oil is coming to an end. It has brought unprecedented prosperity, rapid population growth, rampant consumerism, exhaustion of natural resources and climate change. We have reached the buffers. If we do not learn to live within the limits of the planet, then the planet will throw us off. </p> <p>The Liberal Democrats have an excellent eco-manifesto explaining how Britain can be <a href=\"http://www.libdems.org.uk/campaigns/energy-bill-304947;\">carbon zero</a> by 2050. </p> <p>But carbon is only the latest and worst manifestation of our inability to live within the natural limits of the earth. We have created a society that is programmed to use and abuse every natural resource.</p> <p>Dealing with climate change cannot simply be about replacing one set of technologies or energy sources for another low-carbon version \u2013 it requires a systemic change of mindset about what we want from human society. Growth for the sake of growth can no longer be an acceptable goal. </p> <p><strong>Water as a human right</strong></p> <p>Everything begins with water and water sustains us all. Everyone should be entitled to a free amount of clean water. The rest should be rationed by negotiation and price, which must, in future, take externalities such as pollution into account. River basins need to be managed holistically. An international water court should be set up to function as the final arbiter in the case of conflict over water resources. </p> <p>Western discussion of Pakistan focuses on Islamist militancy, and dictatorship versus democracy. In the long term however, by far the greatest threat to Pakistan's survival as a state comes from water shortages stemming from climate change. Global warming is <a href=\"http://environment.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn13519\">melting the glaciers</a> that feed Pakistan's irrigation system.</p> <p>Pakistan and other endangered countries need massive help and encouragement to improve their water conservation systems and reduce the present appalling level of waste. British international aid should be restructured to make reducing carbon emissions and improving water conservation its central priority.</p> <p><strong>The non-western world: example and education not invasion and imperialism</strong></p> <p>Vietnam was a mistake. Iraq was a criminal mistake. Afghanistan has turned into a mistake that repeats the errors of past Russian and British history. We supported the removal of the Taliban in the aftermath of 9/11, and were pleased to see international police quickly bring law and order to Kabul, but the actions taken by American troops outside the Afghan capital in the subsequent months sowed the seeds for the current bloody failure. </p> <p>We cannot afford the imperialist policies followed by the Bush and Blair administrations in recent years \u2013 even when these have been dressed up in the liberal costumes of \"spreading democracy\". Liberals need to shun such deceptions and return to their proud tradition of anti-imperialism. </p> <p>We have no national interests at stake in Afghanistan except perhaps the war on drugs. It is sad, then, that we have presided over bumper poppy harvests. We would have done far better if we had encouraged farmers there to grow wheat or crops for biofuels and pay them double the price they obtained for poppies. </p> <p>Similarly the best thing we could have done for post-Soviet Russia would have been to invest massively in education for a new generation of Russian lawyers, journalists, economists, environmentalists, human rights campaigners, politicians and accountants. Democracy needs role models; aspiring democrats need help to learn about the tools of democracy. </p> <p><strong>Greater realism about big power relations<br></strong></p> <p>It may seem counterintuitive as the disastrous Bush era draws to a close, and in the year of Barack Obama, but Liberal Democrats should not be dewy-eyed about future US relations. There is no special relationship between Britain and the US (and there never has been) unless by that we mean the US does what it wants and we do what the US wants. Obama is an American and will act with America's interests at heart. We have much in common with the US, but there are also many fundamental differences. In most of the ways that count, Britain is much closer to the EU than the US.</p> <p>We also cannot afford a policy of deliberately confronting China and Russia. Instead we should rely on the force of our successful democratic example to help change these societies from within. </p> <p>Red lines must be drawn against Russian aggression, but they should be lines that are based on the will of the local population and that we are really prepared to defend. The risks of committing ourselves to hopeless positions and reckless allies have just been demonstrated by the war in Georgia. The solution to Russia is not threats but realism, engagement and reduced energy dependence via energy efficiency and investment in renewables. </p> <p>The right approach to the breakup of the USSR in 1991 would have been to disband Nato, a cold war organisation set up to oppose Moscow. Fast-tracking Georgia into Nato will not make the Russian problem go away. Furthermore it is rank hypocrisy for America and its allies to complain about Russian aggression when this is exactly the sort of action the US has always taken, either covertly or openly, in its perceived sphere of influence. We only have ourselves to blame if Russia feels like Weimar Germany today.</p>",
  "<p>Nick Clegg today vowed to end the \"grotesque spectacle\" of hedge fund managers paying less tax than their cleaners by closing loopholes that benefit the super-rich.</p> <p>The Lib Dem leader insisted that plans to take \u00a312 billion from the rich by closing two tax avoidance measures - income tax paid in capital and pensions relief - were \"twice as redistributive as what we went to the country with in our 2005 general election manifesto\".</p> <p>\"We are not being punitive to anyone,\" Clegg told BBC1's Andrew Marr show. \"We are simply saying that we need a fair, simple, transparent tax system where everyone pays their fair share and it shouldn't just be the rich who enjoy these great, big multibillion pound loopholes in the system.</p> <p>\"We should not, through [our] own taxes, be paying twice as much to help wealthy people make their pension contributions than people on ordinary incomes.\"</p> <p>The proposals are part of Clegg's tax and spend plans, which would also see a \u00a320bn cut in state spending to fund tax cuts for those on lower and middle class incomes.</p> <p>He is confident he can persuade his party to rally behind his proposals tomorrow, despite reservations among some grassroots members.</p> <p>In 2005, the party retained its totemic commitment to a 50p income tax rate for high earners - something that was only dropped after a tough internal fight two years ago.</p> <p>Clegg, who is facing his first annual conference since being elected last December, believes his proposals will place the Liberal Democrats in the eyes of voters as the party of fairness.</p> <p>He said: \"In adopting the proposals we are discussing in the coming days, we will be the only party in British politics with a clear plan to restore fairness in the tax system and fairness to the vast majority of British families.

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>Hull did it. West Brom did it. Let's do it.

Only Spurs are keeping them off the bottom of the table. And a summer of static and unsatisfactory transfer activity was followed by the signing of Belgian midfielder Marouane Fellaini for \u00a315m.

Stoke kick us off. first time Everton have been here in the league by the way.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>2 mins: </strong>Jagielka's in the middle for Everton. Lescott back at left-back after his England cameo. It's crackling out there. The crowd, at least, are bang up for it.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>3 mins:</strong> And so are Stoke. Early free-kick just outside the Everton area. Lawrence takes it and smacks it straight into the wall. Out for a long throw that Delap hurls absolutely miles and - hah! - over the bar. That was prodigious. The lad's got a gift.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>5 mins</strong> Lots of bouncy ping-pong stuff in midfield. Everton are a really tall team. They won't be scared of all that. Ball into the area from Arteta but Sorenson gathers (after a little fumble). </p> <p>Pulis is already yelling furiously on the touchline.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>6 mins</strong> Looks a bit like Stoke have brought the touchlines in to make the pitch narrower. The cheeky scamps. Maybe it's an unusually wide pitch. But it looks a little skinny.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>8 mins</strong> Another unecessary free-kick given away, this time by Arteta. Lawrence again hoofs it in, but it's too high. Everton dicing with danger there. Stoke like a set piece.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>9 mins:</strong> Quality from Fellaini there- - nice little pass forward to the Yak but some part of his considerable torso is offside. Some nice touches in that Everton midfield now, with the new Belgian and Arteta, plus Cahill.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>10 mins:</strong> Brilliant flying, full-blooded tackle on Fuller by Yobo. No free-kick, but Fuller stays down in a bit of pain. Exciting stuff. Very English. We all love a tackle don't we.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>12 mins: </strong> Boing!! Four huge booming headers back and forth between the defences. Pow!!</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>13 mins:</strong> Fuller outpaces Jagielka and sprints on to a neat through pass. His shot across Howard is saved at full strength. that was nice football from Stoke.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>14 mins:</strong> Yakubu dances away from Griffin and hangs a little cross to the back post. Headed behind for a corner, but it;s a free kick after Arteta's delivery leads to a huge juddering pile-up in the middle. This is manly stuff.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>16 mins: </strong> an interesting aside to Fuller's tasty turn of speed. He apparently once had the same sprint coach as Usain Bolt. \"But I used to hide when it came to training because I wanted to do football, not track and field,\" Fuller has said. </p> <p>Well, well.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>17 mins: </strong> Great pressure from Stoke. Kitson volleys a cross into the Everton box, Griffin almost picks up the pieces as it bounces clear. Good high energy stuff, without actually creating any real clear openings. They're swarming forward though.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>19 mins: </strong> Lescott gets well forward and sends in a skimming cross, which is cleared via some more aerial keepie-uppie. Lots more commitment there. <br>This is a little bit like watching football in 1985. If they put smaller shorts on you couldn't tell the difference at times.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>21 mins: </strong> Except when Everton build slowly through their new man. Who is promptly dispossessed by some crazed Stoke charging down. Final pass from Delap just can't find Fuller. That was a chance.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>22 mins:</strong> Delap hurls in another long throw. This time Howard catches it on the full. It's a threat, though.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>23 mins: </strong> Yakubu looks a little isolated up front. The ball isn;t really sticking there. <br>From another break Lawrence swings another cross into the Everton box but it's headed clear under pressure by Yobo. Plenty of balls into the area by Stoke, but all from quite long range.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>24 mins:</strong> It's catching. Everton long throw hurled in by Neville, but Sorensen takes it. Ball cleared. Another free-kick from another bruising aerial challenge. In fact, unless I mention otherwise, you can just assume there's a bruising aerial challenge going on out there.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>27 mins: </strong> Fuller wrestled to the ground by Yobo, who clears. No moaning from the Stoke man. It's a man's game all right.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>28 mins: </strong> Launched forward from right-back by Lawrence, for Kitson to challenge for. More heading and leaping. There's a pattern here. Everton get the ball back. Play it around without getting anywhere. And Stoke get it and launch it again. <br>This is cautious stuff from both teams.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>30 mins:</strong> With half an hour gone, still no real chances. This is, let's face it, pretty dull stuff. Everton have five men in midfield. Stoke are looking to \"break quickly\" by hoofing the ball in to their forwards from 30 or 40 metres. Neither team looks like they're really trying to win this. Nick it, maybe.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>32 mins: </strong> Arteta drives forward and almost manages to weave something on the right with Anichebe. Too slow with the passing though. Nobody;s making any forward runs. Yakubu has Everton's first shot of the game. It's well wide. From miles out.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>35 mins:</strong> Isn't it too early to start worrying about being in the bottom three? <br>More slow, slow, hoof, foul.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>36 mins: </strong> Here it comes. The Delap long throw.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>37 mins: </strong> Whooooosh. It's amazing. He hurls it to the penalty spot and it's headed over by Faye.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>38 mins: </strong> Arteta feeds a lovely little pass into Yakubu, who plays it back to Lescott. His cross is headed behind for a corner. Caught by Sorensen. That was probably the best move of the match.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>39 mins:</strong> Credit to David Moyes, his man Fellaini does look the calmest player on the pitch. Wonder what he makes of all this.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>40 mins: </strong> Ho hum. Stoke load another free-kick from the halfway line into the Everton area, but it's a very hopeful ploy and it's headed clear.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>41 mins:</strong> <strong>EVERTON SCORE</strong> The Yak slots it very coolly. Top finish that, after some nice interplay between Arteta and Anichebe. Yakubu gets a bit of space and just sidefoots it in. That was quality stuff.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>42 mins:</strong> And out of keeping with the rest of the game. Everton have done what they set out to. Fought Stoke's early efforts off, then nicked a goal with some neat attacking on the break. </p> <p>Free-kick launched again into Evertons box. Higginbotham heads over.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>44 mins: </strong> Apparently Stoke have deliberately narrowed the pitch here. Just a thought: what does that kind of thing say to your own players? You're not really that good, would seem to be the obvious.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>45 mins:</strong> Stoke corner, played short to Kitson, Lawrence plays it in, but it's all a bit clunky and Everton clear so quickly that Cahill almost ends up scoring from Arteta's cross. Great tracking back by Kitson to block.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>45 mins: Half time.</strong> Well, that's it. Everton deserve to be in the lead, if only because they've managed to pass the ball to each other a few times. It was a lovely goal too, nice little finish. <br>But Stoke have been pretty dreadful. Whole-hearted, but lacking in accuracy and conviction near goal.</p> <p>Incidentally, if that doesn't sound like your cup of tea, why not check out <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2008/sep/14/formulaone.lewishamilton\">Gemma Briggs' excellent running commentary </a>on Lewis Hamilton's latest roller-coaster dodgem ride in the rain at Monza.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p>On Everton's new \u00a315m man, Samuel Zakowski writes: \"OK, so I'm Belgian, and I have seen Fellaini's star rise over the past couple of seasons. Why is he worth 15m? Because he is unique in European football. There is no box-to-box player like Fellaini, who is a driving force, harrying, instilling confidence among team mates, going into battle fearlessly. Then, when he attacks and gets into the opposition box, he causes absolute mayhem.\"</p> <p>Well, yeah. He sounds wicked. In fact, he sounds like the best player in the world. Ever. </p> <p>Watch out Stoke I say.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>46 mins: </strong> <strong>We're off again. </strong> and it's all quite quiet at the Britannia as Everton start by stringing a few passes together and pushing the home team back. Stoke need a lift, some pressure, something.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>48 mins: </strong> More of the same again. Olofinjana wins the ball in midfield but it's all very clumsy and imprecise from the home team. Everton can at least point out that they're the visitors here. Stoke really haven't show anything yet.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>50 mins: </strong> Neville rampages (OK, shuffles) down the right wing and wins a corner. Arteta hangs it up at the near post and it's punched clear. Fuller fouls Arteta. Chance to put it in again. All free-kicks this game.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>51 mins: </strong> <strong>AND EVERTON SCORE AGAIN!!</strong> It's that Arteta free-kick. Arteta drifts it in gently, Anichebe runs away from Olofinjana and unmarked glances it in. That was terrible defending. Pulis will be apopleptic as he should be. </p> <p>Hard to see what Stoke do to change this round now. Try and win some free kicks maybe?</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>54 mins:</strong> <strong>OR THEY COULD JUST SMASH ONE IN THE TOP CORNER!! STOKE SCORE!!! </strong> Olofinjana comes up with the most amazing strike from a knock down form a long throw, volleying it into the right hand corner with incredible power. </p> <p>Blimey. That was a corker. All from the long throw, weakly punched by Howard, but some amazing technique on the end of it.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>56 mins:</strong> Olofinjana will be feeling better. He lost Anichebe for the Everton goal. Really top strike that. <br>Anichebe might be in trouble here. He's looking a bit dazed after a collision.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>58 mins: </strong> Anichebe's all right. Stoke gallop forward and Delpa hurls another long throw into the box. this time it misses everyone and gets to Lawrence but his shot is off target. All sorts going on in the box there. Panic. Thrills. Screams. Cartwheels. It's the Stoke way.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>60 mins:</strong> Fuller puts the ball in the net after galloping on to Kitson's flick on, but it's disallowed for a push on Yobo at the last. He finished it really well there, and then went off on a 30 second celebratory parade, before finally realising it was a free kick. <br>It was quite funny in the end, but you have to say that was soft. Stoke should have had another.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>62 mins:</strong> Everton free kick and a huge scramble under the Stoke bar, the ball just won't go in and in the end Yakubu is penalised for a foul on the keeper. that was hairy. this is a different game.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>63 mins:</strong> <strong>STOKE EQUALISE!!</strong> And it's that long throw again!! Hurled in flat from absolutely miles out by Delap and it's flicked past his own keeper by Jagielka. that was poorly dealt with, but he was under huge pressure in the crowd. Crazy game, crazy second half, crazy stuff.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>65 mins:</strong> It's all going off out there now. It's a total punch-up, Stoke hurling themselves forwards, the crowd totally in it. It's kind of like Gaelic football or Aussie rules. Stoke still attacking this time through Griffin on the right. Everton really under pressure here.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>67 mins:</strong> Fuller wins a corner. The crowd barks and yaps and froths. The big men are up. Another crazed set of collisions in the box. Everton escape for now.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>69 mins:</strong> Everton win a corner of their own, Faye heads clear and Sorensen catches Arteta's follow up. Everton haven't had the ball for 10 minutes here. They need to take a breath and keep it for a bit or Stoke are going to trample all over them.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>71 mins:</strong> A few nice little passes from the men in blue but Fellaini gives it away under pressure. He hasn't seen the ball since Stoke started bossing the game. He must be feeling a little shocked.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>72 mins:</strong> Odd. It's a free kick to Everton on the edge of the penalty area for a handball by Cort that happened inside the box. His linesman seems to have talked him into giving it outside the box. He gave a penalty there at first then changed his mind. Bizarre. </p> <p>Free kick is cleared. </p> <p>That was hopeless. It should have been a penalty.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>74 mins:</strong> And now David Moyes has been sent off for complaining. And he's gone to sit in some vacant seats with the Stoke fans. The stewards won't have that. <br>That was one of the worst decisions of the weekend by the way. With Respect Alan Wiley got it totally wrong.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>77 mins:</strong> <strong>EVERTON SCORE!! </strong>And some kind of justice is done as tiny Tim Cahill creeps in among the huge Stoke defenders and heads in an Arteta corner awarded after Lescott boots the ball into Griffin's head. That was a lovely header. Cahill is a huge player for Everton. and he's back doing his thing. </p> <p>What an amazing half.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>80 mins:</strong> Brilliant play by Arteta, beating his man and feeding Yakubu, who crossed for Anichebe. His volley is deflected wide by a mighty Higginbotham lunge. <br>Stoke are under he cosh now. Can they get some momentum back? They've had ten minutes of all-out attack and the rest just a scuffle.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>81 mins: </strong> Tonge's on for Faye. Sidibe's on for Kitson. Cahill's off for Rodwell to get another chance for Everton. Phew. Big last ten coming up you feel.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>82 mins: </strong> It's all going off. Arteta booked for trying to \"face down\" another Delap long throw by standing in his way. It's hurled in and breaks to Griffin, who volleys it against Anichebe. Was it a handball? No one relaly knows. Ball hoofed away.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>84 mins: </strong> Stoke on a bit of a surge. Pulis is out in his baseball cap yelling at everyone. Delap hoofs it too long and out for a goal kick from a promising situation. <br>Moyes is still sitting in among the Stoke fans. Wonder if he celebrated that goal.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>86 mins:</strong> Cresswell comes on for Lawrence. One of those players who turns up in the Premier League every now and then without actually ever doing anything. Now's his chance.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>87 mins:</strong> Another long throw! Go on Rory!</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>88 mins: </strong> hurled vast distances again but the \u00a315m man heads it away for Everton. He's learning. Cleared for another throw, though. This one is even huger and Howard comes to catch it, fighting his way through hundreds of prone bodies.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>89 mins: </strong> Stoke free kick in a very dangerous position on the corner of the area fate a needless foul by Anichebe. Swung in and headed over by Yobo under pressure. Stoke corner.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>90 mins:</strong> Fellaini clears under pressure but there are 5 minutes of stoppage time for Everton to endure. It's going to be a hot.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>91 mins:</strong> Ball launched forward by Sorensen and cleared for another long throw. Delap hurls it in - heard this one before? - and a stray leg (it's Sonko) hacks a bouncing ball into the side netting. <br>It's pretty much their only tactic, but it's a decent one here.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>93 mins: </strong> Yet aanother brilliant long throw, breaks to Higginbotham, whose shot is deflected wide. That could easily have sneaked in. From the corner more half-chances, thundering challenges, fly-hacks and it's eventually cleared. Anichebe off, Vaughan on.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>95 mins:</strong> Final chance to launch it form an Everton offside. Hoofed by Sorensen, flicked by Sonko and it's a corner. Here comes the keeper!</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>95 mins: FULL TIME. </strong> Stoke's final corner is hacked away and that's it for this afternoon. <br>That was an extraordinary match. the first half was dire. The second half was like pantomime, with goals, dodgy decisions, bizarre tactics and a complete lack of calm, measured football. <br>But it was fun for the neutral in the end and three very important points for Everton.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p>It has to be said, Alan Wiley made one absolutely terrible decision with the penalty. And one bad one with the Fuller goal, which was probably not a foul. </p> <p>Cahill made the difference for Moyes, who ended the game shaking hands with the Stoke fans in his corner of the stand. </p> <p>And that's all for me from now.</p>"
