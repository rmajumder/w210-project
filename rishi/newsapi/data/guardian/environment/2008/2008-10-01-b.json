  "<p>Many savers, investors and home-owners around the globe are feeling the effects of the current tumult in the financial markets. At the same time, on both sides of the Atlantic, household budgets are being squeezed as food and energy prices are increasing while job vacancies are declining. The troubles in the US are compounded by the presidential election and hurricane season, both of which are putting competing pressures on donors' wallets. </p> <p>Charities on this side of the pond also have cause to worry that last year's decline in charitable giving, to \u00a39.5bn, may become a trend. But it is far too early to tell what the real impact will be on giving, and the limited, and largely anecdotal, evidence that is available is mixed. </p> <p>For instance, a recent YouGov poll suggested that Britons will donate 7% less to charities this year compared with last year. Still, this predicted decline is relatively modest, especially when considering the context of the question. When respondents were asked how much money they gave to charity in 2007, the mean total was \u00a3155.35. When asked what their giving will likely be in 2008 \"with the onset of the credit crunch and a possible recession in sight\", the mean total was \u00a3144.55. </p> <p>The same poll also suggested that those respondents making gifts over \u00a3100 expected little change in the amount they will donate. And, when asked what types of expenditure they would cut as a result of the credit crunch, more people said they would cut back on a wide variety of other spending, including on clothes, restaurants, theatre and home improvements, than would reduce their charitable donations.</p> <p>There also may be cause for cautious optimism for giving by the very wealthy, who tend to be more insulated from market shocks. Philanthropy advisers attending the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners (STEP) philanthropy symposium this week reported that the financial environment has not, at least as yet, had an impact on giving by their high-net-worth clients.</p> <p>Corporate philanthropy will also be under pressure, especially for financial institutions. Catherine Sermon, director of community at Business in the Community (BITC) said in Third Sector magazine last week that \"companies inevitably will have to cut investment\" during the economic downturn (19/9/08). </p> <p>However, Alan Eagle, manager of Abbey Charitable Trust, an Association of Charitable Foundations (ACF) member, finds that sentiment amongst corporate and other grant-making foundations in the UK is not as negative as it may be in the US. He told Philanthropy UK: \"It is too early to tell what the effects of the economic climate will be, but there is a general feeling that there will be a period of consolidation and that giving won't go down.\" </p> <p>David Emerson, ACF chief executive, added: \"Foundations tend to give over longer cycles, with 2-3 year budgeting not uncommon.\" However, Emerson also noted that as the economic climate further strains charities, applications for funding may increase, which would make it harder for charities to get funds from trusts and foundations simply because of the greater demand. </p> <p>The real impact on charitable giving of course won't be known for some time, and charities are understandably restless in the face of so much uncertainty. Whilst the sector appears to be facing a challenging fundraising environment, the \u00a39.5bn question is \"How bad is it?\"</p> <p>Still, private philanthropy will likely become increasingly important to charities and other civil society organisations in the UK and around the globe. Indeed, at the European Venture Philanthropy Association annual conference this week, venture philanthropists across Europe recognised that, in the immediate term, they may need to help charities merely to survive rather than to grow or replicate. </p> <p>In an interview with national philanthropy reporters on the eve of the annual Clinton Global Initiative, former US President Bill Clinton said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Around the world, the thing that I worry most about with other stock markets going down and the American market here is that it will reduce the availability of capital.\" </p> </blockquote> <p>Clinton called on foundations, companies and individuals to increase their giving, because philanthropy \"is even more important over the next two or three years than it would otherwise have been\".</p> <p>\u2022 Susan Mackenzie, <a href=\"http://www.philanthropyuk.org\">Directory of Philanthropy UK</a>.

  "<p>Thousands of packets of biscuits contaminated with the industrial chemical melamine were ordered off shop shelves in the UK yesterday, following an alert from the Food Standards Agency.</p> <p>Inspectors were dispatched to Chinese supermarkets and independent retailers across the country to remove and destroy the biscuits after officials in the Netherlands said 3,500 packets of contaminated biscuits had been shipped to Britain.</p> <p>The alert marks the first case of melamine-contaminated food to arrive in the UK since the health scare in China, in which tens of thousands of babies have been taken ill and four have died due to kidney problems after drinking Sanlu infant formula containing the chemical. </p> <p>Yesterday it was revealed that the company at the heart of the scandal asked officials to help conceal the extent of the problem, according to China's state media.</p> <p>The authorities had already said that officials in Shijiazhuang, Hebei, where Sanlu is based, sat on a report from the company for more than a month before telling provincial bosses. </p> <p>But in yesterday's People's Daily, a city government spokesman, Wang Jianguo, said Sanlu asked for help in \"managing\" the media response to the case when the firm informed the authorities of the problem on August 2. Parents had begun complaining to the firm by the end of 2007.</p> <p>According to the paper, Sanlu's letter asked the government to \"increase control and coordination of the media, to create a good environment for the recall of the company's problem products. This is to avoid whipping up the issue and creating a negative influence in society.\"</p> <p>Wang said his colleagues sent a team to investigate as soon as they became aware of the issue. But the People's Daily pointed out that they did not inform the provincial government until September 9.</p> <p>\"We mistakenly thought that taking necessary measures and raising product quality could mitigate the effect and reduce losses,\" said Wang.</p> <p>Firms around the world have since been forced to withdraw a range of products due to health concerns.</p> <p>Britain's Food Standards Agency said the Chinese biscuits, which have not been distributed to major supermarkets, were being withdrawn as a precaution and were unlikely to pose a significant health risk.</p> <p>Dutch authorities raised the alarm yesterday after tests on Koala brand biscuits, manufactured by Lotte China Foods Co, found the biscuits contained nearly twice the precautionary limit of melamine at 4.98mg a kilo. Import checks revealed that 168kg of the biscuits had been sent on from the Netherlands to Britain. </p> <p>The FSA has withdrawal alerts on four products: Koala chocolate cookies, Koala strawberry cookies, Koala yummy cookies chestnut and Koala melon cookies.</p>",
  "<p>True blues have been so worried about the global financial crisis that they haven't noticed that David Cameron's leadership has finally realised it's got to stop being nasty to the Germans if it wants any influence in Europe.Cameron met German chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin last month, and yesterday a German Tory, Peter Ramsauer (whose CSU party, part of the conservative governing coalition, has just lost its majority in Bavaria for the first time since 1945), was allowed to address the conference, admittedly in English. That wasn't all. Dame Pauline Neville-Jones, Dave's shadow cabinet ex-spook, referred to Merkel's lot as \"our sister party\". </p> <p>\u2022 Some of the very smart loos in the ICC conference centre seem to have flies painted on the urinals that encourage men not to pee on the adjoining floor, wall or even ceiling. It is Tory \"nudge\" theory in action.</p> <p>\u2022 The Cameroons may be wriggling on Europe. But the Bruges Group thinktank still has the drawbridge up. A flyer for its grand \u00a3125-a-head fundraising dinner (\"donations can also be made in confidence\") on October 27 reveals that it will be held \"in the presence of\" Lady Thatcher. A curious use of \"presence\" there.</p> <p>\u2022 Organisers have hastily removed the full-size David Miliband-Banana cutouts dotted around the conference: the Milibanana joke does not fit the New Seriousness as the financial crisis deepens.</p>",
  "<p>Warren Buffett, the world's richest man, is pumping $3bn into General Electric as part of a $15bn fundraising by the US industrial conglomerate, which is anxious to calm nerves about the health of its financial services arm.</p> <p>In a resounding vote of confidence, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway investment empire is buying preferred stock in GE. The deal is similar to the billionaire's $5bn leg-up to the Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs last week.</p> <p>\"GE is the symbol of American business to the world,\" said Buffett. \"General Electric is the backbone of American industry, They have strong global brands and businesses with which I am quite familiar. They're going to be around in five or 10 or 100 years from now and, if you buy at the right time, you'll probably make some money.\" </p> <p>At the same time as issuing shares to Buffett, the company is offering $12bn of common stock to the public. GE's chief executive, Jeffrey Immelt, said the proceeds would help to protect the company's triple-A credit rating and could potentially fund acquisitions.</p> <p>\"First, it enhances our flexibility and allows us to execute on our liquidity plan even faster,\" said Immelt. \"Second, it gives us the opportunity to play offence in this market.\"</p> <p>GE is keen to reassure investors over the prospects for its finance division, GE Capital, which generated 45% of group profits last year. The size of the operation has raised questions about GE's exposure to the credit crunch, prompting a slide in the firm's shares in the market's recent sell-off of anything financial.</p> <p>GE Capital provides credit services to 130m customers including retailers, consumers, mortgage lenders and car dealers. Immelt described its activities last week as \"boring stuff\" with little connection to the exotic derivatives which have crippled the banking industry.</p> <p>But concern about the company sparked a 9% sell-off in GE's shares early yesterday. After the company announced its fundraising early in the afternoon, the stock recovered some ground, but closed down 3.9% at $24.50.</p> <p>The presence of Buffett on GE's share register is likely to provide encouragement for investors. The 78-year-old Nebraskan is among America's best respected stock pickers and his words carry weight among millions of savers. Buffett warned for years of the dangers building elsewhere in the financial industry, describing derivatives as \"financial weapons of mass destruction\".</p> <p>\"He is the only major financial institution that has ready cash to buy cheap assets,\" said Tom Sowanick, chief investment officer at fund management firm Clearbrook Financial. \"You could actually call Buffett a mid-western vulture fund who is eating off the debris of the financial chaos.\"</p>",
  "<p>A recession is looming, money markets are teetering on the brink, and families and business leaders alike are slashing their budgets.</p> <p>But none of this is stopping a college in Longton, Stoke-on-Trent, from flying its entire teaching staff to Marbella for a conference.</p> <p>Around 80 members of staff from Edensor Technology College will today check into the Andalucia Plaza Hotel near Puerto Ban\u00fas, while their students are off school for the rest of the week. </p> <p>The 380-room hotel boasts three swimming pools, a sauna, poolside bar, beauty salon and fitness centre, and is near a casino and several golf courses.</p> <p>The headteacher, Richard Mercer, denied that the trip was a \"jolly\" for his employees, and said it was more cost-effective to hold the training event at the four-star hotel than at a venue in the UK.</p> <p>The school declined to comment on the cost, but Mercer said that the school governors had considered nine venues in the UK and abroad before booking the trip 10 months ago. </p> <p>He told The Stoke Sentinel: \"It's unbelievable, but it's more cost effective to go abroad as it's the end of Marbella's season. We looked at conference facilities in Birmingham and London, but they are even more expensive.\" </p> <p>At the meeting, teachers will discuss the school's new curriculum and plans to turn it into an academy, Mercer said. </p> <p>He said: \"If parents think this is a 'jolly' they should join us and find out how hard the staff work.\" </p> <p>In a statement released later through Stoke-on-Trent city council, Mercer said: \"A full training programme, which is being led by reputable international speakers, is in place. We are investing in training our staff to ensure the continuity of quality education for our pupils.\" </p> <p>The two-day conference will be held tomorrow and Saturday, and staff will fly home on Sunday. </p> <p>Meanwhile, pupils have been set tasks to complete at home. </p> <p>Parents greeted the news with incredulity, and asked why the meeting could not be held at the school.</p> <p>Peter Robson, 38, of Longton, said: 'We received a letter saying the school would be shut for training days, but it didn't mention anything about Marbella. It sounds like a waste of money when they could have held a meeting in the school.'</p> <p>Another parent, Andy Sales, aged 34, of Fenton, said: \"Why isn't this money being spent on our kids? Parents are having to take time off work or are paying for extra childcare while the staff are enjoying the sun at the school's expense.\" </p> <p>The mayor of Stoke-on-Trent, Mark Meredith, said: \"At a time of global financial crisis this is not the message that a Stoke-on-Trent school should be delivering ... Whether it's cost effective or not, this is doing damage to the reputation of our schools.\" </p> <p>Last night, a spokesman for the hotel said: \"It's not at all unusual. This is a very comfortable hotel. We have a range of conference rooms and we're just a few minutes from the beach.\"</p>",
  "<h2>Tribute to bravery of banker killed in attack</h2> <p>A senior banking executive who was set upon after confronting a gang died from bleeding to the brain, police said yesterday. Taxi drivers at the rank in central Norwich near where father-of-two Frank McGarahan, 45, suffered fatal injuries in the early hours of Sunday left a bouquet at the scene paying tribute to his bravery. Last night a 21-year-old man was charged with assaulting McGarahan's cousin, who was with him on the night out before a family christening. Magistrates gave police extra time to question two other local men in connection with McGarahan's death.<br><strong>Rachel Williams</strong></p> <h2>Rare public viewing for Stonehenge warrior's gold</h2> <p>The gold treasure of a bronze age warrior made a rare return yesterday to the small museum which has owned it for 200 years - then went straight back to a bank vault. The Bush Barrow gold, from the richest bronze age grave excavated in Britain, a burial mound near Stonehenge, was last seen in public 24 years ago. It is too valuable for the Wiltshire Heritage museum to keep in its building in Devizes. On October 25 and 26, to mark the bicentenary of its discovery, the museum will show the gold with the rest of the finds for two days. It came out of the bank this week so curators could finalise the display.<br><strong>Maev Kennedy</strong></p> <h2>Biggest illegal trawler net seized off Devon</h2> <p>One of the largest illegal fishing nets ever found in the UK has been seized off Plymouth Hoe, Devon, by the Environment Agency. The plastic mesh net, stretching 900 metres (more than half a mile) and set about three metres under the sea's surface, was used for \"ghost fishing\" - once set by the trawlers, left to catch indiscriminately. \"They are very destructive, they trap all sea life including dolphins, seals and turtles,\" said Emma Snowden, of the Marine Conservation Society. Fish caught in the net, such as sea salmon and trout, would be destined for illegal markets, said the agency.<br><strong>Steven Morris</strong></p> <h2>BBC4 controller Hadlow to take over at BBC2</h2> <p>The BBC4 controller, Janice Hadlow, was named the new controller of BBC2 yesterday. Hadlow, who has built a reputation for intelligent and entertaining television on a tight budget at the digital channel in her four years at the helm, will take over from Roly Keating next month. \"Janice is an outstanding original thinker who has led BBC4 from strength to strength,\" said the director of BBC Vision, Jana Bennett. Keating, who is moving to a new role overseeing the corporation's drive to build a digital archive, was considered to have done a good job in reinvigorating BBC2.<br><strong> Owen Gibson</strong></p> <h2>Plan to publish level of animal pain in lab tests</h2> <p>More information about the level of pain and suffering animals endure during lab experiments should be made public, according to a group of scientists advising ministers on how to change regulations governing animal research. They say the change - which was cautiously welcomed by animal rights campaigners - will make animal research more transparent and improve experimental procedures to minimise suffering. The results will form part of annual statistics on the number of animals used in research. Last year 3.2m procedures were carried out, the majority (83%) on rodents.<br><strong>James Randerson</strong></p> <h2>Police appeal after crane is stolen from layby</h2> <p>A 14-metre (45ft) crane was stolen from a layby on the A10 near Harlow in Essex with the 18-metre trailer on which it was lying, police said yesterday. The crane and trailer were due to be picked up on September 25, when it was found to have been stolen. Police believe the yellow Broshuis trailer and blue JIB crane section were stolen between 8pm last Wednesday and 7am last Thursday. They have appealed for witnesses who may have seen it being driven on the A10 or M25. Scotland Yard said: \"The offenders may have taken the property on to the M25 due to its sheer size and weight.\"<br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Former royal butler guilty of sexually abusing boys</h2> <p>A former royal butler is facing jail for sexually abusing boys, one of whom he brought to the Queen Mother's Christmas party at Clarence House. Paul Kidd, 55, of Stalybridge, Greater Manchester, admitted a series of charges from 1975 to 2006 at Manchester's Minshull Street crown court, including indecent assault and inciting a child to engage in sexual activity. He was arrested when a victim saw a newspaper interview with him. Investigations led to the arrest of a second man, David Hobday, 56, from nearby Dukinfield, who pleaded guilty to sexual activity with a child.

Four, believed to be Vietnamese, broke out on Thursday and Friday. They were being detained for possessing forged documents and offences related to the production of cannabis. Three others escaped on Sunday, a Home Office spokesperson said. They are not believed to be dangerous.

  "<p>Anthony Bolton's optimism about stockmarkets is perhaps not surprising (he's a contrarian investor after all), but the great stock-picker also said something explosive yesterday. </p> <p>There is a good chance, he said, that the UK will have to follow Ireland's lead in guaranteeing savers' bank deposits. Why? Because in a global financial market \"you can't have regulators doing different things\".</p> <p>This is an uncomfortable thought for Gordon Brown, who is reluctant to follow the Irish example. But it is clearly true that, just as companies seem prepared to transfer their tax domiciles at the drop of a hat, so are depositors willing to move money across inter-national borders. In the US, money market funds are now guaranteed by the government; British versions are not. So where would footloose, risk-averse international depositors go if they are not concerned about currency risks? The US, obviously.</p> <p>Similarly, the real significance of the Irish move may not lie in the guarantee offered to retail depositors (though that is clearly important). Rather, it's the fact the new system also covers wholesale deposits, interbank loans, and most forms of debt - the stuff that international investors provide. The guarantee covers \"most of the entire funding structure of Irish banks, only really stopping short near preference equity holders\", as Alex Potter, analyst at Collins Stewart, put it.</p> <p>This is quite extraordinary if you think about how a bank funds itself. Take HBOS - which, given its concentration on property loans, is not a bad proxy for an Irish bank. It has assets of \u00a3660bn. On the liability side, it has \u00a3300bn of deposits, \u00a3200bn of wholesale funding, and the rest is insurance and core capital, including shareholders' funds. If HBOS were an Irish bank, those liabilities of \u00a3300bn and \u00a3200bn would be guaranteed by the state - that's three-quarters of the total.</p> <p>In the real world, HBOS finds itself at a competitive disadvantage to its Irish peers. When it needs to roll over its wholesale funding, it must take its chances in the money markets where prices are sky high. An Irish bank can now expect to pay a small premium to the price of sovereign Irish debt.</p> <p>Ireland's move may well constitute illegal state aid, but don't expect the European Commission to act any time soon (there's a referendum to be won in Ireland, don't forget). Ireland may also be considered too small to make much difference in international terms. But big problems would arise if, say, France offered such blanket guarantees to its banks. If that happened, every other EU country would have to decide whether to follow or risk destabilising its own banks.</p> <p>Some would argue that such blanket guarantees are precisely what is required. European countries do not have the US problem of 8,500 banks. Most only have a handful whose failure would represent a systemic risk. So why not give them the state's full support?</p> <p>If you do, though, you have to do many other things. You have to ensure that the managers of the banks, flush with cheap funding, don't go on a crazy lending spree, which got us into the mess in the first place. In short, the state has to tell the bank directors what they can and can't do. Given that the state would already be guaranteeing the banks' liabilities, most people would call that effective nationalisation.</p> <p>Is that what we want? We'd probably prefer to have a proper debate first, because the numbers are boggling. Potter calculates the Irish guarantees represent \u20ac92,000 (\u00a372,000) for every citizen, 2.2 times GDP, or 7.5 years of government spending. He is a fan of the scheme, but admits risks are huge: \"In extremis, Irish taxpayers could be paying for this for a generation.\"</p> <p>The UK Treasury's approach - stay calm, let's see how things work out - seems sensible in the circumstances. We can't be bounced into policy decisions that affect the structure of banking just because Royal Bank of Scotland has an outflow of funds from its Irish subsidiary and a few UK citizens have opened Irish bank accounts. Once these guarantees are given, they can't be lifted easily. The Irish government thinks it's in for two years; let's see.</p> <p>Yet Bolton makes a powerful point about the inconsistencies among regulators' policy responses. The problem is that the banking crisis is now global, not just a US problem.</p> <p>That ought to be in an argument in favour of a co-ordinated international response to savers' legitimate worries about their cash. At the moment, though, we've got a mishmash. We're in danger of unleashing \"beggar thy neighbour\" policies on bank guarantees. Just as \"beggar thy neighbour\" currency devaluations fuelled the 1930s global depression, we risk making a bad situation worse.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:nils.pratley@theguardian.com\">nils.pratley@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Manchester United's assistant manager, Mike Phelan, has emerged as the source of the complaint that Patrice Evra was racially abused by the Chelsea groundsman Sam Bethell in the fracas that erupted after United's Premier League game at Stamford Bridge last April. The defender has made no such complaint but Chelsea will face a Football Association charge for Bethell's alleged use of racially aggravated language because of Phelan's evidence.</p> <p>Phelan, who was the club's first-team coach and has since been promoted, was on hand when the dispute flared. Having lost 2-1, United's players were warming down on the Stamford Bridge turf only to clash with members of the Chelsea ground staff. A 20-man melee broke out, in which Evra was prominent. His team-mates Gary Neville, Park Ji-sung, Carlos Tevez and Gerard Piqu\u00e9, who has since joined Barcelona, were also present. </p> <p>Although it was initially thought that Evra had been incensed by an allegedly racist remark and lost his cool to exchange blows with Bethell, it was Phelan who heard the insult and has stood by his accusation. Both Chelsea and Evra, who has been charged with improper conduct, have personal FA hearings in London today and Phelan is expected to travel south to offer his testimony. Evra will be accompanied by Maurice Watkins, the United director and solicitor, and with no racially aggravated element to his defence, the Frenchman is expected to attribute his loss of composure to the emotion and provocative nature of the situation.</p> <p>Bethell will not deny using insulting language but Chelsea, who were unhappy that the charges were brought last month, some time after the incident, have consistently opposed the racist aspect. \"Chelsea FC is deeply committed to stamping out racist behaviour and would never condone it,\" said a club statement. They maintain that Bethell acted in self-defence.</p> <p>The FA originally brought a case against Bethell, charging him with improper conduct and the use of racially aggravated language but at a preliminary hearing an independent commission ruled that the FA did not have disciplinary jurisdiction over him, as Chelsea had failed to notify him that he was subject to the FA's rules and regulations. The charges against Bethell were dismissed and the FA instead charged the club with failing to ensure the proper conduct of their employee, making particular reference to his failure to refrain from \"any one or a combination of racist and/or abusive and/or provocative conduct and/or language\".</p> <p>They also charged Chelsea for their failure to include the required provisions in Bethell's contract. The club appear to have little option but to plead guilty to this minor charge but, having requested a personal hearing, their legal representatives will fight the damaging allegation of racism. Given that Evra has not made the accusation, they are confident of victory.</p> <p>One of the seven groups reported to be bidding for <strong>Newcastle United</strong> stepped out of the shadows, it was reported last night, and declared itself confident of meeting the owner Mike Ashley's asking price of around \u00a3300m. \"Now is the time to reveal who we are out of respect for the supporters,\" said Jonathan Cleland, who heads the Bok Consortium, said. \"We have in our consortium the world-class skills and talents to achieve the footballing and commercial success required and deserved.\"</p> <p>It is believed that Michael Owen's contract negotiations with Newcastle have been put on hold until Ashley finds a new buyer.

  "<p>The dramatic increase in piracy in the Gulf of Aden could trigger a humanitarian and environmental disaster in the Horn of Africa and cut off global sea routes through the Suez canal, a report warned yesterday.</p> <p>The report, by the Chatham House foreign policy thinktank, calls for a reinforced international naval presence in the region to combat the mostly Somalia-based pirates, with a significantly strengthened European component. </p> <p>It also suggests the creation of a coastguard run on Somalia's behalf, possibly by the UN or African Union in the absence of a stable government in Mogadishu.</p> <p>The Chatham House report emerged in the midst of a tense maritime standoff between the US navy and pirates who have seized a Ukrainian ship filled with tanks and other heavy weapons. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/somalia\">Somalia</a>'s foreign ministry said yesterday that telephone negotiations were taking place between the owners of the MV Faina and the pirates, who are demanding a $20m (\u00a310m) ransom to release the vessel and its 21 crew. The ministry added that foreign forces had permission to use force if necessary.</p> <p>One of the pirates told Agence France Presse by telephone that they were \"prepared for any eventuality\". He also denied reports that three of the pirates had been killed during infighting on board.</p> <p>The US defence department, which is seeking to ensure that the weapons are not off-loaded and used to fuel the Islamist-led insurgency in Somalia, said yesterday it was in no hurry to take action. </p> <p>According to figures compiled by the International Maritime Bureau, 16,000 ships sail through the Gulf of Aden each year. There have already been more than 60 pirate attacks off the Somali coast and in the Gulf of Aden so far this year - more than twice last year's total. Pottengal Mukundan, the bureau's director, said 12 vessels and 259 crew were being held for ransom. Shipping companies are thought to have paid ransom demands of up to $30m this year. \"They have no choice. They have no one to turn to, to deal with the pirates,\" Mukundan said.</p> <p>The Chatham House report said insurance premiums for shipping through the Gulf of Aden have increased tenfold. The combined danger and cost, it said, could \"mean that shipping could be forced to avoid the Gulf of Aden/Suez canal and divert around the Cape of Good Hope\".</p> <p>\"This would add considerably to the costs of manufactured goods and oil from Asia and the Middle East,\" the report said. It also warns that if an oil tanker was seriously damaged in a pirate attack it could cause a \"major environmental disaster\". </p> <p>The pirates have hitherto focused on extorting ransom but the report warns that if any were co-opted by international terrorist networks, the objective could switch to causing maximum damage, perhaps by scuttling a large ship at the entrance to the Suez canal.</p> <p>There is also an immediate humanitarian threat. Ships delivering about 185,000 tonnes of food aid to Somalia are being protected for now by the Canadian navy, but its mandate runs out at the end of this month and it is so far unclear what would take its place. If the supply from the World Food Programme was halted, millions could starve.</p>",
  "<p>Drax, Britain's biggest coal-fired power station, said yesterday it had bought equipment that will cut its carbon dioxide emissions by more than 2.5m tonnes a year.</p> <p>It has signed a \u00a310m contract with Doosan Babcock Energy for direct-injection biomass co-firing systems for all six of the coal-fired units at its 4,000-megawatt plant in North Yorkshire.</p> <p>The new facility, which will allow Drax to mix renewable biomass materials - such as straw, wood and food and agricultural residues - with coal will be the largest of its kind in the world.</p> <p>Drax's chief executive, Dorothy Thompson, said the deal was a critical step in the development of its co-firing project. The combination of the new facility and Drax's existing co-firing capability would give the company a total renewable capacity of 500 megawatts, \"making us the largest single-site renewable generator in the UK\".</p> <p>\"We are only too well aware of the need to tackle climate change and the competence we have developed in biomass procurement and project execution means that we are able to play our part in the move towards a low-carbon economy, while at the same time delivering reliable and secure supplies of electricity.\"</p> <p>Drax said it was making good progress on upgrading its turbines to increase their efficiency. The project, when completed, is expected to cut another million tonnes of CO2 emissions.</p> <p>Drax said the combination of greater turbine efficiency and increased bio-mass capability would cut its annual emissions by more than 15% by 2011.</p> <p>Drax supplies about 7% of Britain's electricity, making it a crucial part of the country's supply infrastructure.</p> <p>The energy industry regulator, Ofgem, is expected to publish National Grid's winter forecast for gas and electricity supplies today. It is expected to be sanguine about the industry's ability to meet the country's needs over the coming winter but is expected to warn against complacency and to highlight Britain's increasing exposure to global energy markets.</p> <p>Wholesale power prices have risen sharply this week on concern over generating margins. \"It is important to note that the current price issues are based on specific short-term factors,\" said Ian Parrett, marketing manager of power broker Inenco. \"While concerns remain for supply margins in future years, it is expected that the situation will ease in the new year. This is supported by prices for 2009 contracts, which have eased in the last few days as the market waits for direction from the US bail-out negotiations.\"</p> <p>Market sources suggested the wholesale price for November had been driven higher by demand from one of the country's electricity generators. Wholesale gas prices continue to fall on growing confidence over future supply.</p>",
  "<p>The Palace of Westminster and the Bank of England have been exposed as among the country's least energy efficient public buildings by a new law to measure carbon dioxide emissions from the national estate.</p> <p>Around 18,000 buildings, including town halls, museums, schools and job centres, are being tested to discover their energy efficiency on a sliding scale where A is the best and G is the worst. Parliament and the Bank both scored a G. Together, they consume enough electricity and gas to pump out 21,356 tonnes of CO2 a year, the equivalent of more than 14,000 people flying from London to New York.</p> <p>New buildings also fared badly, raising questions about the validity of sustainability claims made by architects and developers. London's City Hall scored E despite opening in 2002 and being described by its architect Foster &amp; Partners as a \"virtually non-polluting public building\". The Treasury's headquarters on Horse Guards Parade scored the same despite a complete office refurbishment six years ago that was supposed to \"set new environmental standards in Whitehall\". </p> <p>In Manchester, the Imperial War Museum North, designed by Daniel Libeskind and opened in 2002, scored a G, the same as its 91-year-old sister museum in London.</p> <p>The government estimates that almost a fifth of all carbon dioxide emissions in the UK are caused by non-residential buildings, and environmental campaigners said the findings mean the government must launch an urgent refurbishment programme to slash carbon emissions.</p> <p>The Natural History Museum spends \u00a31.4m a year on electricity and gas - a figure that is expected to double from this month as a result of rising world energy prices. One of the most energy hungry buildings in the country was the National Media Museum in Bradford, a 1960s structure, which scored a G. One in four of the 3,200 buildings assessed so far scored F or G, and the average was D. Only 22 buildings - under 1% - scored A. </p> <p>\"These results show our leaky and draughty public buildings should be a priority target for refurbishment,\" said Paul King, chief executive of the UK Green Buildings Council. \"In a turbulent financial climate, lower energy bills will benefit the taxpayer for years to come. If we are to cut our carbon, save money and achieve energy security, our buildings have to be on the front line of this battle.\"</p> <p>\"We review 350 significant new build projects a year at design stage and we hear a lot of greenwash,\" said Matt Bell, director of public affairs at the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment, the government's architecture watchdog. \"The knowledge that from now on this performance will be objectively measured should mark the end of that.\"</p> <p>The findings emerged yesterday as it became law for any public building larger than 1,000 square metres to show a display energy certificate (DEC). The system is similar to the colour coded labels which show carbon emissions caused by refrigerators and cars. On that basis, the Bank and parliament are the building equivalent of a petrol-hungry Land Rover Discovery.</p> <p>No 10 Downing Street managed a D rating, which is better than average for its building type. But the prime minister's heating, lighting and air conditioning still create 675 tonnes of CO2 a year, a bigger carbon footprint than a street of 28 families of four living in semi detached homes, each driving 10,000 miles a year and flying to Spain on an annual holiday.</p> <p>The findings are likely to embarrass the government, which has pledged to make all new public buildings zero carbon by 2018. The Department for the Environment's head office recorded an E. </p> <p>Forty-three per cent of 374 jobcentres scored E or lower. Eland House, the 10- year-old head office of the Department for Communities and Local Government, which has overseen the DEC system, scored an F.</p> <p>Building occupiers can be fined up to \u00a31,500 if they fail to display the certificate and report on how efficiency might be improved. The Welsh Assembly, built to supposedly environmentally friendly designs by the architect Lord Rogers, is one of many occupiers which could face the fine after they missed the deadline and failed to put certificates up.</p> <p>Buildings that performed well included a Jobcentre Plus office in Goole in the East Riding of Yorkshire, which received a B after lighting movement sensors were installed, a policy of turning off all computer monitors at night was introduced and timers were fitted to heating boilers.</p> <p>\"There are cheap measures which can be carried out to reduce most energy bills in these kinds of buildings by 20% quite quickly,\" said Jacqueline Balian, director of information for the Chartered Institute of Building Services Engineers, whose members have carried out around two thirds of the DECs. \"Common problems are chillers and boilers running at the same time and leaving boilers on all night. This system of DECs should make the management of energy used by buildings much more high profile.\"</p> <p>Iain Wright, the housing minister, who is responsible for the certification programme, said: \"Display energy certificates are a valuable tool in the fight against climate change.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Saturday October 4 2008. There were two errors in an article above about the energy efficiency of public buildings. The Imperial War Museum North is in Trafford Park, Manchester, not Salford. Goole is in the East Riding of Yorkshire, not Humberside. The county of Humberside was abolished in 1996. These errors have been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>People who say that political parties are now all the same didn't spend the past three weeks at party conferences. Some of the components are reliably consistent - the warm lunchtime chardonnay, the crumpled fringe meeting leaflets, the bars that never seem to close. \"It's a bit like freshers' week, isn't it?\" laughed a TV executive in Manchester - and that's exactly what it feels like. \"Quite exciting, but quite stressful,\" he added. \"You keep thinking, am I having a good time? Or do I actually want to go home now? You never feel quite sure if people like you or not. And you keep wondering if you're missing something better going on somewhere else.\" </p> <p>Tony Benn said they seemed to be taking place without reference to politics - and in a way he was right too. \"They've managed to veto politics for about a month, haven't they?\" he smiled wistfully. \"They've just discussed Gordon Brown. Conference has become a ministerial press conference, in the middle of a trade fair.\" </p> <p>But for all the expensively choreographed stage management, and the corporate gloss, and for all the good intentions of the party faithful, the remarkable thing about each conference was how perfectly it told the truth. The season began with the collapse of Lehman Brothers and closed with the collapse of the US bail-out bill, but even a crisis of global capitalism couldn't quite divert or disguise which way power and the parties are going. </p> <h2>Liberal Democrats, Sept 13-17</h2> <p>There was something unwittingly fitting about the Lib Dems' destination this year. The seaside had been abandoned by both other parties in favour of metropolitan heartlands, leaving the Lib Dems perched on the cliffs of the south coast - a cruelly peripheral metaphor. Under cloudless blue skies, delegates wearing backpacks ambled along the promenade in Bournemouth eating ice creams, indistinguishable from the late-summer surfers and holidaymakers of an English seaside town. </p> <p>Under normal circumstances, looking normal should be a good thing in politics. Looking young is usually another advantage, for one of the measures by which a party can be judged is the age of the members it attracts. I was in Bournemouth with the Tories in 1998, one year into their wilderness, and their conference looked like a daytrip for inpatients from a geriatric ward. Most of the delegates had wild staring eyes, the women with rouge daubed randomly all over their faces. Many looked uncertain about quite where - or who - they were. But the Lib Dems' conference in Bournemouth this year could have been mistaken for a geography students' field trip. </p> <p>The youthful faces crowding the terrace of the Highcliff hotel were unlined and wholesome, even blushed with pimples. But the impression this should have made of a party with a promising future was spoilt by the striking absence of a generation for any of them to aspire to. The classic bearded sixtysomething Liberals were there in modest numbers. But the generation in between that actually runs things was almost entirely missing - as if Lib Dems are uniquely vulnerable to a fatal mid-life disease. Which, in a way, they are.</p> <p>If you want to see what politics without any relationship to power looks like, there it was in Bournemouth. \"This is the friendliest conference by far,\" a youthful delegate beamed, and he wasn't wrong. All the unpleasant elements - secret plots, security checkpoints, media scrums, strutting - had been excised, but along with them any governing sense of jeopardy. I didn't even see a single policeman. \"We're like a family,\" someone said, and they certainly seemed immune to status anxiety. Everyone was apparently welcome to everything; at night there were no hot tickets to exclusive parties behind velvet ropes, and it was all very convivial. But it didn't feel like an event that had the slightest bearing on anything.</p> <p>As the global banking system began collapsing, a fringe meeting in a Georgian hotel suite was debating the esoteric distinction between social and liberal democracy. Across the entire fringe, incorrigible optimism bloomed, for at meeting after meeting all the talk was of overtaking Labour to become the chief challenger to the Tories. \"We-e ha-ave,\" a prospective parliamentary candidate warbled breathlessly, so young it wasn't clear if it was nerves or his voice breaking, \"a once-in-a-century opportunity to sideline one of the major parties!\"</p> <p>But the last time I spent much time around Lib Dems, at a byelection four years ago, they were also talking about a historic breakthrough - only then it was to overtake the Tories as challengers to Labour. I ran into the press officer from that campaign in one of the hotel lobbies. How could he still believe in power at the end of the rainbow, just over the next hill? \"Well, the Lib Dems have always been the most optimistic party,\" he said cheerfully. \"When I joined 20 years ago we were polling 6%, with 20 MPs. Now we've got 63 MPs and 18%. That's progress! There's a real sense now that Lib Dems can really get elected. I mean, there's a guy here who was deputy first minister of Scotland. There are Lib Dems who have been in government, and they're alive!\"</p> <p>Nothing seemed to bother them, not even a session with a man from Populus. \"When it comes down to it,\" he told a fringe meeting bluntly, \"two thirds of voters say it doesn't matter what the Lib Dems offer on policy, because they'll always only ever be a protest vote.\" Do your polls ever ask them if they'd vote for us if they thought we could win, someone asked. Er, yes, said the man from Populus. \"But your problem is, lots say they only vote for you because they know you can't.\" Everybody just chuckled.</p> <p>By day two, the trains back to London were filling up with journalists. No one felt like watching a friendly game of bowls, when there might be live naked cage fighting coming up next week.</p> <h2>Labour, Sept 20-24</h2> <p>At first I read the slightly eerie atmosphere in Manchester as suspense. Then it dawned on me that it wasn't that at all. It just felt spooky because there weren't enough people there. There were no queues, and the exhibition stands outside the hall that used to be a corporate forest had thinned to a public sector copse. Delegates too young to remember John Smith, or old enough to remember Hugh Gaitskell, were very thin on the ground. Almost everyone looked like a thirty- to fortysomething professional. </p> <p>When Tony and Cherie Blair emerged from the Radisson for his final leader's speech two years ago, the short walk had the drama of a scene from Reservoir Dogs on a catwalk. Labour party conference used to be the political equivalent of Morton's restaurant on Oscar night. You didn't even need to recognise the ministers by face; you could spot them from the flurry of entourage and cameras. </p> <p>The first sign this year that something strange had happened came when Alistair Darling crossed the concourse and climbed the steps without turning a single head. In the middle of a global economic crisis, the chancellor of the exchequer was attracting less attention than a blonde woman wandering about in a T-shirt that said Never Kissed A Tory. Senior ministers kept strolling by, alone or with just a solitary aide, drawing scarcely a glance, let alone a stampede. </p> <p>David Miliband was the only one swishing up and down, a middle-distance celebrity smile soldered to his face and a semi-circle of photographers stumbling backwards before him. But even that didn't last past his speech. When heads did turn, it was in the direction of men no longer in government: John Prescott, Charles Clarke, Peter Mandelson. But then - hold on - who was that over there? Suddenly, an excited, star-struck swarm burst on to the concourse, jostling as arms scrambled to hoist mobile phones overhead. Everyone craned their necks to see who could be at the centre of the scrum. Not an ex-party leader, or even an ex-minister, but an ex-civil servant - Alastair Campbell.</p> <p>\"It's pretty desperate, isn't it?\" an MP muttered gloomily. \"When the star of the show's a bloody former spin doctor.\" </p> <p>If there was a star of the fringe, it was Compass. The fresh energy and even excitement of the left-leaning group's meetings managed to revive many spirits - but for MPs facing losing their seats, the gloom couldn't lift. </p> <p>Another backbencher's constituency was only just down the road, but he had almost not bothered coming this year. \"I can't stand it,\" he shrugged. \"I can't see the point. People keep saying Brown's got to make himself more likable to voters. But frankly he could start by making himself more likable to his own MPs.\"</p> <p>Most did like his speech. Some were even tearful. As Brown and his wife toured the media parties in overheated suites later that night, a few delegates sprang forward to shake the leader's hand. But as the retinue passed by, the expression on most faces was chillingly blank. They simply stood and stared, distantly curious, like strangers watching a funeral cortege pass by.</p> <p>An anarchic, last days of Rome madness had set in, the hotel bars sodden with hard drinking long into the night. Strangely, no one ever seemed to get drunk - just heavier and darker and more desperate. Reporters huddled in toxic corners with cabinet members, trading the latest names to be called cunts by No10. \"What about me? What did they say about me?\" ashen ministers would gulp, and the paranoia was unnervingly contagious. If ministers weren't frightened of each other, they were frightened of looking like conspirators. When Miliband and James Purnell crossed paths outside the Radisson, an anxious aide murmured that they could be caught on camera together, and discreetly ushered the pair apart. </p> <p>At the New Statesman's final-night party in the gothic majesty of Manchester town hall, a left-leaning businessman tried to rationalise the breakdown as a cycle of abuse. \"I don't think they used to be like this,\" he reflected. \"But when the public start to hate them, they start to hate each other. It's hard to be in government, you know, and it's hard to make a difference. If you intimidate each other you feel as if you're being powerful. It just,\" he finished sadly, \"makes them feel powerful, when they've stopped being able to exercise real power.\" </p> <p>More than a cycle of abuse, it felt like the end of an era. What had begun back in 1994 was turning full circle, the ugly 3am briefing of Ruth Kelly's resignation in the Midland bar a last ghost of the old Red Lion days of Charlie Whelan. But the self-belief - or Faustian pact - that had once sustained the project had broken down into self-loathing. Forged by spin doctors, the party was still in love with Campbell, even as it dissolved into mutinous rage, spitting at the thugggery of his unlovely successor, \"that fucking Damian McBride\". </p> <h2>Conservatives, Sept 28-Oct 1</h2> <p>Fifteen years after the last Tory prime minister was raging at his cabinet \"bastards\", the two parties' parallel circles were almost complete. There were moments in Birmingham, in fact, when the symmetry seemed closer to the narrative of a novel than real life. \"I'm at the Tories,\" a startled reporter texted me before I arrived. \"There are THOUSANDS of them\" - and that was an understatement. In a vast conference centre, guarded by that latterday signifier of import, Group 4, there was scarcely room to move.</p> <p>From the angular, peachy-skinned young bankers and frosted trophy wives to the impeccably groomed elderly couples, the overwhelming first impression was of money. It felt a bit like being back in an 80s wine bar. \"Jeremy! Meet Christina!\" But the freak show of the past decade had been replaced by delegates who, individually at least, would not have been completely out of place at Labour's conference. It was only en masse that they looked identifiably Tory - largely, interestingly, because of the women. Some of the younger men did appear to have emerged from the womb wearing pin stripe, but it was the high heels, fur trim, pearls and pencil skirts that defined the conference aesthetic: Square Mile meets city lawyer, with only the faintest hint of hunt ball. Just two years ago, the elderly country contingent had still been conspicuous, dressed as if for market day, but now you had to look very hard for tweed. Although upper-middle-class, the party suddenly looked urban.</p> <p>The makeover was nothing compared with the new discipline, though, or seriousness of purpose. Lunchtime fringe meetings were packed out, with questions from the floor that were even actual questions, not the traditional rambles beginning \"Would you agree that . . .?\" Some in the finance sessions were so specific and sharply detailed, it bordered on Money Box Live. Whether by accident or design, the party had chosen a venue with only one small hotel bar, so there was nowhere for members to drink and plot even if they had wanted to. Everyone kept moving, eyes fixed firmly on the prize. </p> <p>If they thought it was in the bag, though, they weren't saying so. I asked everyone I spoke to if they thought they were going to win the next election, and not one broke the embargo on triumphalism. \"Ye- ,\" one woman did begin - then checked herself. \"Well, I hope so.\" Some were so tense with self-censorship, they wouldn't talk to the Guardian at all.</p> <p>There was still no hiding where their hearts lay. Two years ago, no matter how many times George Osborne repeated his mantra of \"sharing the proceeds of growth\", he couldn't soothe his party's impatience for tax cuts. Little had changed. Across the fringe, the demands kept coming: What about a flat-rate tax? Corporation tax is crippling small businesses! Why don't we copy Ireland? The discrepancy between the preoccupations of the leadership - \"Our biggest idea is social reform,\" insisted Oliver Letwin - and the rank and file's thirst for market forces was stark. When I asked delegates if they personally knew anyone suffering the sort of social disadvantage David Cameron talks so much about, they stared back at me blankly. </p> <p>\"You're not allowed to speak against the drug addicts on council estates now, are you?\" whispered a middle-aged delegate from Southend. \"It's become censored, hasn't it?\" She giggled naughtily. \"I don't know about a race relations board - you need a board to safeguard white working taxpayers, if you ask me.\" Wasn't she happy with the direction of the party under Cameron? \"Oh yes! Good heavens, yes.\"</p> <p>If anything, Labour's rank and file are more ideologically in tune with their leadership now than most Tories are with theirs. But like old Labour in the 90s, they are being brought to heel by the irresistible promise of power. There isn't the same cultural gap; the Tory frontbench is even richer and whiter than its rightwing followers. But there was a lot of distinctly Blairish goading of old hardliners by shadow ministers, with Michael Gove mocking Simon Heffer's insistence on cutting public spending as though it were as preposterous as renationalising the railways.</p> <p>And so just as in New Labour's early days, observers spent the week trying to work out whether or not the leadership meant what it was saying. I met a former No10 adviser emerging from a session with Letwin. \"Well,\" he said, looking confused, \"that was the most enjoyable hour I've ever spent at a Tory party conference. He was very thoughtful - very impressive.\" </p> <p>How would he feel if the Tories became the next government? There was a long, anguished sigh. \"When I think about it, I get a very strange feeling in my stomach. In a way, you sort of hope they mean what they're saying, because that would make it less destructive. But then you look around you, and you think ... you just think, they can't mean it, can they? Can they?\"</p> <p>Actually, probably not, judging by Cameron's closing speech - a surprisingly retro traditional Tory crowd pleaser, which began by praising the armed forces, the family and even, bizarrely, \"the union\", before romping through one tabloid b\u00eate noir after another - 'elf and safety, bad manners, sloppy spelling. If members had worried that they might be pushed even further out of their comfort zone by Cameron, they went home yesterday reassured. </p> <p>By then it was no longer even clear that it will matter what he really means. The same panic on the markets that was bringing down banks was being played out within both parties, where dramatic shifts in confidence looked in danger of becoming self-fulfilling. \"Being pessimistic,\" joked the shadow minister Paul Goodman, \"is a sackable offence in the Conservative party now.\" If voters do behave like stockbrokers, and the strength of the parties' policies matters less than their mood, then the Tories may be home and dry. </p> <p>Perhaps the more important unanswered question than whether they mean it is whether they are up to it. With a well-disposed press, and a Labour party busy eating itself, they are almost entirely untested. A local councillor, and member for more than 60 years, put it cautiously but anxiously. \"The only thing I'd be concerned about is there's this shadow cabinet, and half of them I've never heard of. I really don't know in my heart that they've got the right guys. If we win, it's going to be very uphill. And I'm just not sure . . . well, I'm just not sure about these chaps.\"</p> <p>In this sense, the political landscape is completely different from 1997. The most powerful lasting impression of conference season was the almost total absence of political giants. At the Lib Dems I had assumed this was just down to the party's insignificance, and at Labour to having been in power for so long that a generation had matured without the freedom of opposition in which to grow. But on stage in Birmingham yesterday, applauding Cameron's speech, where were the formidable faces? Even after 18 years out of power, the last government in waiting had boasted an embarrassment of big beasts: John Prescott, Clare Short, Jack Straw. Most voters would struggle to even name, let alone recognise, the cabinet they say they plan on voting for.</p> <p>Political life today is said to be all about personality and performance, yet it's hard to think of a time when it attracted fewer big personalities or performers. \"It's just,\" a veteran political editor lamented, \"so unbelievably grey, isn't it? Bloody hell, it's grey.\" </p> <p>Tony Benn liked to sit on his canvas folding chair in front of the Quakers' meeting house outside the conference zone in Manchester, eating sandwiches and smoking his pipe. A steady stream of passers-by would stop to pay their respects. A woman confessed she hadn't been on the Stop the War march this year, and started to cry. \"Don't give up!\" he told her gently. \"It's a struggle, but never give up.\" A man approached him hand in hand with two small children. \"I just wanted,\" he explained, \"my children to have met you.\" </p> <p>Giants always look big when you're young, and smaller as you grow older. But if you really wanted to change the world, I'm not sure you would have been at any of the conferences this month.</p> <p>\"It's very odd,\" Benn reflected. \"The TV news comes on, and they interview bankers as if they were politicians. And then the politicians come on afterwards, and they get interviewed as if they were pundits\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Thursday October 9 2008</strong></p> <p> Some confusion arose in the following review of a television drama about knife crime as a result of mishearing the term shanking, which means stabbing someone with a knife, as shagging.</p> <p> </p> <p>It's hard, I know, to think of anything before Global Economic Armageddon. But only a short while ago, the papers were full of a different horror. Remember? The news was all about the nation's youths shooting and knifing each other to death, and for nothing really: turning into the wrong street, looking at each other the wrong way, simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p> <p>This is still going on, it's just that we don't care any more because we're now more concerned about our savings and our buy-to-let mortgages (or bye-bye-to-let mortgages as they're now known). </p> <p>TV drama takes a little while to make, so this<strong> Silent Witness</strong> (BBC1), about hoodlum hoodies, looks like an effort to engage with the real world, and that should be applauded. It's even up to scratch with the vernacular (like I know!). The first two-parter in the series - series 12, can you believe it? - is called Safe. That, of course, is not safe as in safe as houses or safe sex, but safe as in the modern meaning of the word, ie good. Although, because anyone who uses the word in this way is almost certainly not at all good, it can be understood by the rest of us to mean bad - which incidentally used to mean good, even before wicked meant good, but hasn't for a long time. Do you see? </p> <p>\"Shagging\" is maybe a simpler example. These kids are all constantly shagging each other, which means they're sticking knives and firing bullets into each other, not having sex (though they are almost certainly doing that, too - and this is highly unlikely to be what you and I would describe as safe sex, because safe sex, to them, is not at all safe, if you see what I mean). </p> <p>Dr Nikki Alexander, meanwhile, is shagging the handsome ambulance man, but fortunately for him - very fortunately for him - only in the old-fashioned sense of the word. Incidentally, I've never been totally convinced by Emilia Fox - I mean she's fantastic and beautiful and I'm absolutely in love with her, obviously; but I just don't believe in her as a senior home office pathologist, as I did Amanda Burton. Burton had more gravitas.</p> <p>Anyway, Dr Alexander's boss, Professor Leo Dalton (Britain's answer to CSI's Gil Grissom), is having to do community service after being caught drink-driving. I like that - you wouldn't catch Grissom drink-driving. CSI may have the glitz and glamour, but Silent Witness does the grit. Flawed crime-solvers, that's what we have over here. </p> <p>So, during his community service on some rough old estate in London, Leo gets to run with all these kids. And then he witnesses a shagging, right in front of him on the football field. </p> <p>Actually, I don't know if it counts as a shagging, as young Errol doesn't die (yet), because Leo saves him. But then another kid, Itchy Ritchie, gets properly shagged, four bullets - thud, thud, thud, thud - in the chest, at a basketball gym. Videoed on a mobile phone, too (happy shagging?). And it turns out all this is connected to a body they've got on the slab back at the lab (quite a coincidence, I know, but it's fiction). There's something extra naked about a naked body on a pathologist's slab.</p> <p>We're treated to two postmortems in this one. Itchy Ritchie actually has his brain sliced up (quite thick slices) so we can see the evidence of foetal alcohol syndrome in his frontal cortex first-hand. It's there to see on his palm, too - though I don't think the phrase \"simian crease\" is acceptable any more, is it? Come on Dr Nikki, get with the times. Still, poor Itchy Ritchie. He was a victim before he was even born. </p> <p>There are loads of Real Issues in here: drinking in pregnancy, absent fathers, respect and disrespect, mistrust of the police, the police simply not getting it, gangs, desensitised youth, drugs, gun and knife-crime. But this is not some kind of worthy message thinly disguised as drama. It is, first and foremost, drama. Cracking drama, too (with the odd, forgivable loopiness), that simply engages with the real world. I'm itching - sorry Ritchie - for part two.</p> <p>And for series 13, they can tackle the credit crunch - Dr Nikki, Dr Harry and Prof Leo carving up emaciated bodies on their cold slab. Stomach completely empty, hasn't eaten for weeks, another death by poverty ...</p>",

  "<p>A report on cannabis prepared for next year's UN drug policy review will suggest that a \"regulated market\" would cause less harm than the current international prohibition. The report, which is likely to reopen the debate about cannabis laws, suggests that controls such as taxation, minimum age requirements and labelling could be explored.</p> <p>The Global Cannabis Commission report, which will be launched today at a conference in the House of Lords, has reached conclusions which its authors suggest \"challenge the received wisdom concerning cannabis\". It was carried out for the Beckley foundation, a UN-accredited NGO, for the 2009 UN strategic drug policy review. </p> <p>There are, according to the report, now more than 160 million users of the drug worldwide. \"Although cannabis can have a negative impact on health, including mental health, in terms of relative harms it is considerably less harmful than alcohol or tobacco,\" according to the report. \"Historically, there have only been two deaths worldwide attributed to cannabis, whereas alcohol and tobacco together are responsible for an estimated 150,000 deaths per annum in the UK alone.\"</p> <p>The report, compiled by a group of scientists, academics and drug policy experts, suggests that much of the harm associated with cannabis use is \"the result of prohibition itself, particularly the social harms arising from arrest and imprisonment.\" Policies that control cannabis, whether draconian or liberal, appear to have little impact on the prevalence of consumption, it concluded. </p> <p>\"In an alternative system of regulated availability, market controls such as taxation, minimum age requirements, labelling and potency limits are available to minimise the harms associated with cannabis use,\" said the report. </p> <p>It claimed that only through a regulated market could young people be protected from the increasingly potent forms of cannabis, such as skunk. It is intended that the report will form a blueprint for nations seeking to develop a \"more rational and effective approach to the control of cannabis\".</p> <p>The authors suggest there is evidence that \"the current system of cannabis regulation is not working, and ... there needs to be a serious rethink if we are to minimise the harms caused by cannabis use.\"</p> <p>Last night, the report was welcomed by drug law reform organisations. \"The Beckley foundation are to be congratulated for the clarity of their call for cannabis supply to be brought within government control,\" said Danny Kushlick of Transform. \"We look forward to the same analysis being applied to heroin and cocaine.\"</p> <p>The report is being launched at a two-day conference, which will be attended by leading figures in the drugs policy world. </p> <p>The conclusions are unlikely to be embraced by the government or the Conservative party, both of which are opposed to relaxing restrictions on cannabis use.</p>",
  "<p>British Airways chief executive Willie Walsh has slammed Tory plans to build a high-speed rail network instead of a third runway at Heathrow airport and described the party's aviation policy as \"all over the place\".</p> <p>Walsh said a high-speed route linking Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds to London through a 180mph rail service would not address capacity problems at Britain's largest airport. He added that Tory airport policy was riddled with inconsistencies, with some in the party opposed to all airport expansion, some in favour of a third runway and another wing, led by London mayor Boris Johnson, in favour of building a new hub airport in the Thames estuary.</p> <p>\"The latest idea that a rail link from Leeds and Manchester to Heathrow would be an adequate substitute for a third runway beggars belief,\" Walsh said in a speech at the Institute of London Insurance. He added: \"So the Conservatives apparently want to undermine the UK's efforts to succeed in a global economy - and condemn Heathrow to permanent status as the most delay-prone airport in Europe.\"</p> <p>He is optimistic that a Conservative government under David Cameron will change its mind over Heathrow, particularly if business leaders get their way, but yesterday's speech reflects frustration at BA over Cameron's refusal to listen to the case for expansion. A proposal to expand Heathrow by increasing the number of flights at the airport, followed by the opening of a third runway in 2020, is the subject of a public consultation by the government. A final verdict is not due until December but the government is expected to reiterate its aviation policy and endorse Heathrow expansion.</p> <p>\"The Conservatives may have an election to win. But they must not forget that if they are successful, they will have a country to govern,\" said Walsh. Echoing comments by Heathrow's owner, BAA, Walsh said he would welcome a high-speed rail link to Heathrow but stressed that it would be \"complementary\" to air travel and not a replacement for it. The BA boss has pledged to scrap the airline's domestic services to Heathrow if a high-speed link acts as an alternative \"feeder\" service for BA's long-haul routes, by transporting passengers from outside London to its main hub.</p> <p>Stephen Hammond, the shadow transport minister, said BA was \"not a disinterested party\" in the debate and rejected Walsh's claim that choosing high-speed rail over airport expansion will be bad for the economy. \"We are disappointed that Mr Walsh has taken that attitude. We have spent a year working with leading railway and funding experts and we know that it is fundable. It stacks up in economic and environmental terms.\" </p> <p>BAA has claimed support for a third runway from 100 leading companies and business organisations including the London Stock Exchange and the Confederation of British Industry, which has placed adverts in the press backing calls for airport expansion.</p> <p>In the US, a former British Airways executive faces an eight-month prison sentence after pleading guilty to price-fixing. Keith Packer, a British citizen who was a former commercial general manager for BA's cargo arm, admitted to fixing the cost of freight services to and from the United States.</p> <p>In a plea bargain with the US department of justice, Packer will serve eight months in a US jail, pay a $20,000 (\u00a311,222) fine and cooperate with the ongoing investigation. By agreeing a deal with prosecutors - which is still subject to court approval - he avoided the maximum punishment of 10 years in prison and a $1m fine. \"Those who conspire to cheat US businesses and consumers by fixing shipping rates will be held accountable,\" said Scott Hammond, the deputy assistant attorney general.</p>",
  "<p>As the convulsions in the global financial system grind on, political certainties continue to dissolve and what last week seemed outlandish becomes today's common sense. Across the western world, politicians are struggling to keep up, but none more so than the British Conservatives, whose leaders have repeatedly had to tear up their scripts since the opening of the party's annual conference in Birmingham at the weekend.</p> <p>Like the US presidential candidate John McCain, they have tacked and hedged under the weight of events: from outright opposition to bank nationalisations earlier this year to now quietly accepting them; from defending speculative short-selling last month as \"a function of capitalist markets\" to meekly signing up to a ban; and from David Cameron's insistence at the weekend that there would be no \"cheap lines bashing financiers\", to Tuesday's declaration that it was \"easy to see why people are so angry with the bankers\" and yesterday's promise that there would be a \"day of reckoning\" - though, following St Augustine, not yet.</p> <p>The same goes for George Osborne's party-sweetening pledge of a two-year council tax freeze, which showed every sign of having been cobbled together before last month's Wall Street seizure and already seemed to be coming unstuck yesterday as councils across the country insisted they would not participate in a scheme to cut essential services during a recession.</p> <p>Gordon Brown has of course been able to finesse his own repositioning - from \"light-touch regulation\" to \"whatever it takes\" intervention - under cover of a blizzard of poll-boosting prime ministerial activity. But no such option is available to Cameron. So having offered his entirely unnecessary cooperation with government action to tame the markets, the Tory leader yesterday used his conference speech to focus on anything and everything but the crisis engulfing the Anglo-American capitalist model he unequivocally supports: his own character and judgment, the mirage of governmental experience, the \"infection\" of the \"health and safety, human rights culture\" and the eternal Tory verities of responsibility, \"low taxes and sound money\".</p> <p>When he did touch on the economic crisis, it was only to blame the level of government borrowing and the removal of responsibility for financial regulation from the Bank of England - neither of which can seriously be regarded as a cause of the meltdown in the markets. </p> <p>Of course when Osborne ridicules New Labour's \"fawning\" on big money and attacks the government for a boom built on housing and credit-fuelled debt, he draws blood - even if his claim that Britain's budget deficit is \"larger than any in the developed world\" is not actually true, as Henry Paulson could advise him. But as the week has gone on, it has become ever clearer that the Tories have little sensible to say about the crisis and nothing to propose to overcome it.</p> <p>It's not hard to see why. New Labour enthusiastically climbed on the bandwagon of deregulated markets in the 1990s, but it was the Conservatives who unleashed them in the 1980s. And for all their talk of \"casino capitalism\", Cameron's Tories are hamstrung ideologically, financially - including by their own hedge-fund donors - and by their recent history, from demanding the necessary action to bring private finance to heel. </p> <p>Like Northern Rock, Bradford &amp; Bingley was privatised, or \"demutualised\", as a result of Thatcherite deregulation, and its reckless expansion and collapse could not have happened without it. What can Cameron usefully say about that? So he fell back yesterday on proposals to cut corporation tax and demands for a smaller state at exactly the time when only large-scale state intervention stands between us and the implosion of the entire financial system.</p> <p>As a result, the Tories are now irrelevant to the crisis in Britain, while in the US popular pressure from both left and right at least temporarily blocked the something-for-nothing Paulson bail-out plan for a takeover of bad debts without the necessary public equity stakes, recapitalisation and democratic control to turn the banking sector round - let alone a clampdown on toxic executive pay largesse or support for the those now being turfed out of their homes. </p> <p>The Senate was last night preparing to vote on the scheme, which looks certain neither to fix the problem nor make those responsible bear the costs. The same would apply to any comparable rescue the government might be tempted to mount in Britain. At every stage of the credit crisis, Brown has strained to avoid any challenge to the neoliberal principles New Labour was built on, notably delaying the nationalisation of Northern Rock for months while fruitless attempts were made to find a private sector buyer.</p> <p>Even the past fortnight's more effective interventions, in the sale of HBOS and the takeover of Bradford &amp; Bingley, have sought at every turn to minimise any lasting public sector role. In the case of Bradford &amp; Bingley, the profitable parts have already been sold, in classic lame-duck nationalisation tradition, to the Spanish bank Santander. But the scope for these piecemeal interventions may be coming to an end. In particular, if the HBOS deal, the last rampart of a private solution, were to unravel, there is already speculation that wholesale nationalisation of banks could become unavoidable. </p> <p>The case for wider public ownership in the financial sector is in any case growing stronger with every twist of the crisis and every failure of regulation. The private sector has repeatedly and now disastrously shown itself unable to run the financial system without devastating collateral damage. And if banks are considered too important to the wider economy to go under, they cannot be considered part of a competitive market system.</p> <p>Such radical solutions would only arise out of dire necessity. But the longer the crisis continues, the more they will be raised - and when a US Republican treasury secretary comes up with a $700bn bank rescue package, the potential of what governments can do with political will is thrown into unusually sharp relief. No wonder Cameron has been warning that the crisis risks leading the left to turn its back on free-market economics. In reality, the battle has been won over the necessity of intervention. The argument is now over what form it takes - and who benefits.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:s.milne@theguardian.com\">s.milne@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Pity the residents of what New Labour politicians think of as the strong and joyful ecotowns, one of which might yet blight a stretch of landscape near you by 2020. Not only will they have to live in developer-built dormitory suburbs given a fashionable name, they will also be the subject of unprecedented scrutiny by quango folk who, in a holier-than-thou spirit, will check on just how \"eco\" ecotown folk will be. </p> <p>Thermographic cameras will be used to check which homes lose heat, says Cabe, the government's ever-expanding Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment. Will Cabe wardens be sent to patrol ecotown cul-de-sacs squealing \"Shut that door\" and \"Put that bloody tungsten light out\"? </p> <p>This busybody quango also plans to monitor the ecological footprint of the diet of 100 randomly selected residents, as well as calculating C02 emissions from transport within any given ecotown. </p> <p>Ecotownies partial to lamb cutlets and to cream on their strawberries might yet be watched as closely as al-Qaida suspects. Retailers in these housing gulags, says Cabe, should provide plenty of products with a low meat and dairy content in line with studies showing that a significant reduction in animal product meals could cut the ecological footprint of food by 60%. \"Consumer goods\", adds Cabe, \"account for 14% of an individual's ecological footprint and the target should be to halve the impact from this\". We will have to wait and see whether ecotownies will be deterred from eating HobNobs, hummus, imported haricot beans, or all three.</p> <p>If the silly season was still in full swing, such tomfoolery would be funny. Disturbingly, this nosy-parker nonsense really does appear to inform thinking underpinning Labour's sorry ecotown project. Perhaps ecotown children can be encouraged to report wayward parents to ascetic Cabe commissioners as these guardians of environmental law cycle past. \"I caught my dad eating steak and oven-ready chips.\" Doubtless, one of New Labour's \"titan\" jails will provide \"porridge\" to such miscreants. Cabe insists that it's not trying to play a Big Brother role and simply wants to collect useful information about \"eco towns\", but it comes across as a bully boy body.</p> <p>Not only is this kind of policing fundamentally against the spirit of British town life, it is also wrong-headed and even hypocritical. </p> <p>It is wrong-headed for at least two simple reasons. First, it would be unjust to single out one set of townspeople for such petty prying. If ours is to be a land of snoops, then let us all suffer such indignities and, in doing so, learn to fight back with common sense and common decency. Second, every small town used to be an \"ecotown\". We do not need special ecotowns and their inquisitions. Instead, we need to spur ourselves into living greener lives in existing towns. Crank down the heating and wear a jumper when it gets cold. Build new homes in existing towns and villages. Open farmers' markets rather than plot yet more supermarkets.</p> <p>Cabe, meanwhile, sees no gap in the logic of, on the one hand, promoting ecotowns and, on the other, of gleefully encouraging new supermarkets in old towns. In my own small Suffolk town, Hadleigh, Cabe has \"congratulated\" Tesco and the district council for a proposal to build a banal supermarket, with greater floor space than the whole of the existing, chain-free high street, on a much-loved watermeadow long given over to allotments. If this plan were to be given the go-ahead, the town's carbon emission, and traffic, will rise to unhappy and unjustified levels, while local food suppliers and sellers will be eased out of business. </p> <p>Even as this government and its pointy-headed minions lecture us on \"sustainability\" and plan their patronising and illiberal ecotowns, they undermine existing settlements that, unknown to meat and dairy snoops, and, innocent of thermographic cameras, are far \"greener\" - unspoilt and free of government and quango interference - than \"blue sky\" towns planned by wonkish thinking and bullying edict.</p> <p>\u2022 Jonathan Glancey is the Guardian's architecture critic <a href=\"mailto:jonathan.glancey@theguardian.com\">jonathan.glancey@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>It was the week the credit crisis swept Europe. The fireworks began on Monday as Glitnir bank in Iceland was nationalised; Hypo Real Estate in Germany was rescued by a consortium of other German banks; and Fortis, the largest private employer in Belgium, was propped up by governments in the Benelux countries. Rounding out the wave of European banking fragility were the nationalisation of the UK's own Bradford &amp; Bingley, the Irish government's move to guarantee deposits and debt at six large banks in Ireland, and the bail-out of Dexia by Belgium, France and Luxembourg.</p> <p>Politicians need to use the summit called by the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, to develop a workable and comprehensive plan. The priority must be preventing healthy financial institutions from becoming insolvent simply because they temporarily lack liquidity. The excessive risk taken on by banks globally and the opaque nature of the derivatives market has caused banks to fear lending to one another. When BNP Paribas froze withdrawals from three investment funds because of US sub-prime exposure in August 2007, everyone realised large losses could be hidden anywhere. Clearly, some banks are hiding the ball, and since no one knows who owns what, interbank lending has virtually ceased. The interbank market has become a grand game of cards, with everyone afraid of getting stuck with the old maid.</p> <p>Things could still get much worse, and soon. To halt the decline, European governments should follow Ireland's lead and make an explicit guarantee of deposits to end potential distrust among depositors. They should bite the bullet and temporarily guarantee certain bank debt obligations to reassure banking counterparties. Guaranteeing interbank loans taken at Libor (the London interbank offered rate) should be sufficient to bring down interbank lending rates.</p> <p>As guarantees increase moral hazard, the governments must require national regulators, such as the FSA, to quickly determine which banks are insolvent. The government can then decide on whether to liquidate these insolvent banks or sell their assets to other financial institutions. The private sector should be used to realise the remaining solvent banks. Many investors are ready to contribute capital under the right circumstances. However, if necessary, the government should contribute through preferred shares or warrants. </p> <p>Regulators might look to separate \"good\" assets from \"bad\" assets in the solvent banks to further bolster interbank confidence. Instead of buying assets up at inflated prices, as treasury secretary Hank Paulson has suggested the US government do, they should stick bad assets into a separate \"bad bank\" controlled by the regulators at market prices.</p> <p>Ireland presents a model of action. The measures taken there and the others outlined above are needed immediately throughout Europe to restore confidence. Regulation can wait until this acute phase of crisis has ended.</p> <p>When the acute phase is through, we can all begin to assess how to prevent crisis from recurring. Will Hutton said in these pages yesterday that one way Britain can avoid crisis in the future is to join the euro. I strongly disagree. As we shall see, Ireland and Spain, with their devastating property crashes but tied to the euro, will not fare well within the straitjacket of the single currency. Instead of joining the euro, regulation and capital requirements for banks that anticipate economic downturn will be of utmost importance.</p> <p>But those are steps for later. Let us hope our political leaders understand the gravity of the crisis at hand and act swiftly to avoid economic depression.</p> <p>\u2022 Edward Harrison is a banking and finance specialist at Global Macro Advisors and author of the blog <a href=\"http://www.creditwritedowns.com\">creditwritedowns.com</a></p>",
  "<p>This week's announcement that a new Conservative government would build high-speed rail links should in itself be welcomed (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/29/toryconference.transport\">Tories plan \u00a320bn 180mph rail link instead of Heathrow third runway</a>, September 29). However, a \"\u00a320bn TGV-style rail link\" will only form one part of a solution and simply does not address Britain's long-term airport capacity needs.</p> <p>The rail link will, according to its promoters, serve Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds and will \"cut 66,000 flights a year - 44% of the capacity of the planned third runway\" from Heathrow. However, Heathrow only serves Manchester and Bradford, and not Birmingham. Therefore, even if every passenger on these two routes switched to rail, Heathrow would still be operating at over 97% of capacity and would remain, to all intents and purposes, full. Further, these flights make up less than 3% of Heathrow's total flights - nowhere near the 66,000 claimed.</p> <p>\"The Tories hope to cut flights to Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels, as passengers are encouraged to use the new high-speed rail line which would link up with the Eurostar service at St Pancras,\" you report. But a high-speed rail network already exists to destinations in Europe, and passengers still choose to fly. It is not realistic to expect that a new rail link between Heathrow and St Pancras will result in 52,000 flights being cancelled - the only way to achieve this would be to ban flights to western Europe.</p> <p>However, the critical point in this debate is that the choice between rail and air is a false one: the country needs both. Heathrow is full today and, with airline slots at Heathrow trading at up to \u00a330m each, it is clear that any limited surplus capacity created by rail would be quickly absorbed. High-speed rail would, though, undoubtedly complement a third runway at Heathrow, and help create a world-class transport hub of which Britain could be proud. </p> <p>Overseas, our competitors are investing in airports and rail. France, a long-time leader in European high-speed rail, has a hub airport at Paris with twice as many runways as Heathrow. Spain, which has just opened a new high-speed rail line between Barcelona and Madrid, has also doubled to four the number of runways at Madrid airport.</p> <p>I'm all for the \"first new rail line north of London in more than a century\", but we should also get on and build the first new full-length runways in the south east since the second world war - first at Stansted and then at Heathrow. Rail is never going to serve the long-haul destinations that Heathrow can - and even for short-haul routes, rail will always be more limited than in continental Europe because we are an island nation. Moreover, it is not the nature of our links between Manchester and London that will determine our future economic success, but our connections with the world's emerging economies in India and China.</p> <p>All major infrastructure decisions are difficult, and they impact on local communities and the environment. There are no simple solutions; however, the decisions we take (or avoid) now will affect our competitive position for generations.</p> <p>\u2022 Colin Matthews is chief executive of BAA <br><a href=\"mailto:heathrowmediacentre@baa.com\">heathrowmediacentre@baa.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Middle Eastern countries should set up a new regional organisation that includes all Arab states as well as Israel, Iran and Turkey, pro-western Bahrain urged yesterday.</p> <p>The call - which is likely to provoke controversy - came from Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmed al-Khalifa, the Gulf state's foreign minister. \"Why don't we all sit together even if we have differences and even if we don't recognise each other?\" he told the London-based daily al-Hayat. \"Why not become one organisation? </p> <p>\"Aren't we all members of a global organisation called the United Nations?

Syria is Iran's only Arab ally. But other Arab states, especially Saudi Arabia, fear Tehran's regional influence and nuclear ambitions.

  "<p>The financial crisis may be dominating the US presidential campaign, but the season's most intriguing political battle is shaping up as a straightforward fight for survival between two old foes: Sarah Palin and the polar bear.

The case of Palin v Polar bear will be heard in January. Here's how the contenders size up: <br><strong><br>Range</strong><br>Polar bear: Found across the Arctic regions of five countries; the US, Canada, Russia, Norway and Greenland. <br>Sarah Palin: Not quite as well travelled. Lives within sight of Russia, but has never ventured there, possibly because of diminishing sea ice. </p> <p><strong>Conservation status</strong><br>Polar bear: Vulnerable, largely due to climatic change and the resulting habitat loss. <br>Palin: Also vulnerable, because of a lack of experience and controversial stances on abortion, creationism, global warming, same-sex marriage and the environment.</p> <p><strong>Predatory armoury</strong><br>Polar bear: Possesses razor-sharp teeth, a powerful build and a sense of smell that can detect a seal a mile away under three feet of snow. Still unlikely to triumph in a direct confrontation with Palin however, unless the Alaska legislature suddenly decides to uphold the right to arm bears. <br>Palin: Licensed gun-owner, avid hunter and crack shot. Palin also supports a policy of shooting wolves from helicopters in order to increase the Alaskan moose population so that Alaskans can shoot more moose. Deadly. </p> <p><strong>Impact of climate change</strong><br>Polar bear: Length of hunting season has diminished, birth rates have fallen and it now has insufficient fat reserves. <br>Palin: None observed.</p> <p><strong>Biggest supporters</strong><br>Polar bear: Greenpeace, the US department of the interior, the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the US Geological Survey.<br>Palin: Hockey moms, the National Rifle Association, rightwing fundamentalist Christians, climate change deniers, the oil industry, God (endorsement unconfirmed). </p> <p><strong>Biggest threat to survival </strong><br>Polar bear: Sarah Palin. <br>Palin: Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Biden, feminism, belated national reality check brought on by global economic crisis.</p>",

Here, Ian Hislop tries to establish whether the closure of a third of the rail network was a necessary evil, and finds that the complaints we have about the railways today haven't changed much over the years - fare hikes and (a lack of) punctuality were the main concerns back in the 50s, too.<br><strong><br>Beautiful People</strong></p> <p>9.30pm, BBC2 </p> <p>\"I wasn't always a slightly fey window-dresser in glamorous New York,\" says Simon in this adaptation of Simon Doonan's childhood memoirs. \"I was a slightly fey schoolboy in humdrum Reading.\" Beautiful People, charting the exploits of the campest teenagers in Berkshire, is packed with some wonderfully hammy performances (especially from Olivia Colman as Simon's bottle-blonde, gin-quaffing mother), looks gorgeous and, most brilliantly, has a truly heart-warming joie de vivre.

  "<p><strong>I've been in love with a friend of mine for two years now. Coming into a new work environment, I felt alienated and lonely until he reached out and made a real effort to include me in his social circle. However, my behaviour towards him was unforgivably lukewarm and I ended up socialising with another group of friends whose relationships with one another seem to be borne out of convenience rather than genuine affection.</strong></p> <p><strong>Despite this, my colleague continued to spend time with me, and it was then that I realised my feelings for him go beyond friendship. However, frustratingly, his popularity means that I can never spend enough time with him. I have remained in the closet for years, and have never acknowledged my sexual orientation before, so I feel completely clueless in this situation.</strong></p> <p><strong>Though others have jested about our \"relationship\", he doesn't seem to notice the gossip. We have continued to be friends. He has recently decided to move away, and although we will still see each other socially, it won't be the same when he's not around. He's straight, so I know nothing could ever happen between us, but the painful prospect of losing him means I am now seriously considering telling him the truth, if only to save our friendship and make the time we spend together less uncomfortable for me. Do I owe him this, or would keeping quiet prevent me causing irreparable damage?</strong></p> <h2>Find a real relationship </h2> <p>It's very hard to come to the realisation that you want to act on feelings you've had for so long about your sexuality, so you need to give yourself a break. Staying in the closet has probably contributed to your feelings of isolation. The stress of keeping secrets and the guilt of perceiving yourself to be deceiving this man somehow permeate your letter, yet you have nothing to feel ashamed of.</p> <p>Coming out is hard, but like childbirth, a brief period of excruciating pain is eclipsed by the benefits of a happier life afterwards. I'm sure your friend will be supportive if you confide in him about your sexuality, but as far as your feelings for him are concerned, you're right to recognise the reality of the situation that he is straight. Many of us have met the straight boy of our dreams. Being in love with someone who is unobtainable is easy - they can never truly reject you because a relationship with them isn't viable with them in the first place. If you're in love with him, you're avoiding the emotional risks involved in finding a real relationship with an available man. If you tell him how you feel about him, he may be flattered and moved by your feelings, but be prepared for him to be very embarrassed.<br><strong>PM, via email</strong></p> <h2>Talk about your sexuality</h2> <p>The discovery, or at least recognition, of your sexual orientation ought to be shared with a trusted confidant, as it may be blurring your perception of this relationship. That person may or may not be the colleague you have such strong feelings for. It is possible to experience a very deep love towards another man, which may draw on your sexual attraction to him, but which is only destined to develop in a platonic and emotionally rewarding direction. It may go beyond the understanding of a casual friendship, but it may still be worth letting your friend know your heartfelt feelings for him, without dwelling too much on their sexual nature. </p> <p>You have discovered there is an intimate bond between the two of you, and quite naturally, this provokes a sense of loss at his departure. If he is genuine, he will seek to understand your brave declaration of the depth of your feelings for him - he may indeed share them.<br><strong>DW, London</strong></p> <h2>Keep quiet and move on</h2> <p>I'm afraid there are few options open to you in this situation: it's the ancient tragedy of unrequited love. The crux of the problem is: if your colleague is straight, then the best you can expect from telling him the truth is a polite rejection. At worst, being told unexpectedly that your friend loves you can feel very intrusive; it may put a great burden on him. Sadly, the best option to preserve your friendship is to keep your secret and your pain to yourself.</p> <p>There's great consolation to be had in treating your feelings of love as a great pleasure in themselves. Love can be painful, but in the way that childhood memories are always bittersweet as they are imbued with the regret that we'll never experience them again, so it is with affections that will never be reciprocated. It's always a good idea to keep a safe, sceptical distance from the realities of our fantasies, so that the pleasant attraction and desire remains, but the spell is not broken by a disappointing truth. If you begin to think in this way, your distress may subside, and eventually you may be able to move on from this experience quite naturally.<br><strong>DP, via email</strong></p> <h2>It is time to come out</h2> <p>One of the great things for me about coming out as gay was that I stopped being besotted with straight men. I can't explain why it happened but it was, presumably, something to do with my increased self-respect and the realisation that I was not alone in my feelings. The process was not without its difficulties, but it enhanced my emotional wellbeing no end. </p> <p>Wherever you live, there will be gay social groups, helplines and support organisations near you to advise and guide you through all this. You may want to talk about this with your friend; you may also want to mention the feelings you have for him too, or not. </p> <p>Coming out is like entering a new world. It is an adventure - so it's risky - but it's definitely to be recommended.<br><strong>Name and address withheld</strong></p> <h2>What the expert thinks: Linda Blair</h2> <p>The reason you're feeling confused is that you're approaching your predicament as if it's one problem, when actually there are two separate issues that you need to address.</p> <p>The first is your friendship with your colleague. Why do you feel this friendship will be threatened if he moves away? You explained that for some time after you first met, you spent much of your time with others. Yet he remained loyal to you, and he even went out of his way to see you. That doesn't sound like someone who'll let distance stand in the way of a friendship. Anyway, even though you work in the same office now, it doesn't seem that you have many opportunities to meet up. His departure may even strengthen your relationship, because you'll both have to make more of an effort, and you'll value the occasions when you manage to get together more highly. It's unlikely, therefore, that your friendship will suffer when he moves away - that is, if the friendship remains on the terms it's on now.</p> <p>The real threat here is not that your friend is moving away, but rather that you're proposing to introduce a new element into the relationship, one that will change its quality. You want to tell your friend that you have feelings for him that he can't return. To help you understand what that may do to the relationship, try putting yourself in his position.</p> <p>Imagine that a female friend of yours confessed that she's in love with you, and has been so for some time. How would you feel? Wouldn't you be sad, because you'd know that you're unable to return her feelings? Wouldn't you also feel rueful, because you'd realise that you hadn't necessarily helped her, nor made her happy by spending time with her - but that instead you may have caused her to feel frustrated? You might hesitate to contact her after her revelation, for fear of leading her on. I hope you can see that there would be nothing to be gained - and potentially much to be lost - by confessing your love.</p> <p>However, this brings us to the second issue, the one you've conflated with your relationship with your friend. That is, you also need to come to terms with your sexuality, and discover how you can go about finding a fulfilling sexual relationship. You say you've kept your sexuality a secret \"for years\". Why? After all, if no one knows you're gay, why would anyone think to introduce you to a potential partner? And if you hide your sexual orientation, how would another gay man know you may be interested in a relationship?</p> <p>I know that, sadly, prejudice towards gay people still exists, so you'll need to consider carefully how and who you come out to. You may need some advice - consider talking to someone you know who's gay and seems at ease with their sexuality. Visit queery.org.uk, or call the London Lesbian &amp; Gay Switchboard on 020-7837 7324.</p> <p>I hope you can see the way ahead more clearly now. You can - and should - stop worrying about losing the friendship of a loyal and caring person simply because he's not on your doorstep. At the same time, there's no reason to deny yourself the chance of finding a lover.</p> <p>\u2022 Private Lives appears every Thursday. You are invited to respond to this week's main problem. If you would like fellow readers and Linda Blair to answer a dilemma of yours, send us an outline of the situation of around 250 words. For advice from Pamela Stephenson Connolly on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns.

He has a busy job, which takes him all around the world, and he is hugely focused on his career. I would very much like to get married, and I have attempted to discuss the subject with him on a number of occasions over the past few years, but he refuses to give me a straight answer. My friends say that when they try to broach the matter with him, he becomes uncomfortable and evasive. His response to any conversation that touches on the issue is to defer any decision-making for a further two years, saying we can talk about marriage then. </p> <p>I have reluctantly accepted this because I don't want to lose him, but my friends are concerned that he is messing me around and they have asked me what I think he's waiting for exactly. They have asked me why he finds it necessary to postpone even discussing it, if he intends us to get married eventually, or at the very least, hasn't ruled out the possibility of this. They point out that, even if he feels it is too early for us to marry at the moment, that doesn't stop us getting engaged, thus making a commitment to do so. They fear that I am risking tremendous disappointment in the future, having already invested years of my life into this relationship, in the hope that it will proceed to a lasting partnership and marriage.</p> <p>Are they being cynical, or am I being naive?</p>",
  "<p><strong>I recently stopped travelling by bus to work and started cycling. I felt good about helping the environment. Then a friend suggested I was making things worse. His logic was that the amount of diesel I was saving by not travelling on a bus was tiny. By cycling in bus lanes, making buses behind me slow down and drive along in an inefficient manner, I was causing them to use far more extra fuel than I was saving. Is he right?</strong></p> <p><strong>Jeff Bloom, London </strong></p> <p>On yer bike, Jeff. This seems to be the advice of those who have studied this conundrum. While there is general agreement that by slowing down a bus with your two-wheeled dawdling you are indeed causing it to chuck out more emissions than if it was cruising along unimpeded, you need to view the bigger picture. </p> <p>Professor Frank Kelly, who leads the environmental research group at King's College London, which specialises in studying the impacts of urban air pollution, says that this dilemma \"illustrates well how we can sometimes lose perspective\". First, buses are getting \"pretty clever\", he says, and, with \"engine management and injection timing\" they can optimise their efficiency during their typical stop-start journeys. Second, and more importantly, the more people cycle, the less need there is for other road traffic. This is the greater good cyclists need to consider.</p> <p>Richard George, roads and climate campaigner at the Campaign for Better Transport, agrees: \"By cycling you are encouraging yet more people to cycle. All the studies show that cyclists feel safer when surrounded by other cyclists. And by encouraging more people out of cars and on to bikes you are reducing traffic levels and therefore allowing buses to travel more efficiently and faster.\" The real problem, says George, is not the plodding cyclist but the illegally parked cars and vans that stop in a bus lane, throw on their hazard lights, and nip into the adjacent shop. </p> <p>Kelly adds that it's best just to avoid bus lanes altogether by getting hold of a free cycle map from your local council. Or, he says, \"just cycle a bit quicker\".</p>",
  "<p>When Russia was accused of a cyber attack on Estonia last year, the White House took notice. George W Bush voiced a concern that the US was vulnerable to similar warfare. And when some in the military raised suspicion that Chinese cyberspies had already penetrated unclassified Pentagon computers, the decision was made to start a command to fight for America's supremacy online. </p> <p>The $2bn (\u00a31.1bn) project, which was started under the wing of the air force, was due to become fully operational later this year. Ominous adverts about hack attacks on the Pentagon were commissioned to recruit more people. And then, last month, it was suspended. No reason was given.</p> <p><strong>No-brainer</strong></p> <p>\"The notion that modern countries should consider cyberspace a theatre of war is a no-brainer,\" says Bruce Schneier, chief security technology officer at BT and a Guardian columnist on web security. \"It seems like they've had a lot of political manoeuvring over who should run it. The question is not whether there should be one, but where.\"</p> <p>That's not the only question that Air Force Cyber Command had to answer. People weren't quite sure whether it was there to protect air force assets or all cyberspace. Some thought it would only be responsible for computer networks, while others were convinced that anything that used the electromagnetic spectrum would fall under its purview - including laser weapons. And no-one knows why it was put in charge of both cyberspace and space operations.</p> <p>Cyber Command was started in response to millions of attack probes or scans from malicious computers on the Department of Defense's Global Information Grid (or GIG), which encompasses the military's networks, systems and computers. </p> <p>\"The nature of the threat is large and diverse,\" says Timothy Madden of Cyber Command. \"It includes recreational hackers, self-styled cyber-vigilantes, various groups with nationalistic or ideological agendas, transnational actors and nation-states.\" The Pentagon felt a new section was needed because \"much of the DoD's networks, systems, and computers is dependent upon commercial telecommunications links and the internet\".</p> <p>Schneier sums up its role more clearly, saying that Cyber Command is there to take \"any military actions in cyberspace. Blowing things up, making them not work, just like in the real world. It's also offensive and defensive, just like in the real world.\"</p> <p>Sami Saydjari, CEO and founder of online security company Cyber Defense Agency, was one of 54 leading computing figures who wrote an open letter to President Bush in 2002 urging him to secure the internet. \"Potential costs of a multi-critical infrastructure attack on the banking system, the power grid and so on in a sequence designed to do maximum damage approaches the trillions, and the damage would look like a thousand hurricane Katrinas.\"</p> <p>It's not something a 14-year-old could do in his bedroom, however. \"You'd need half a billion dollars and three years,\" says Saydjari. \"But that amount of money and time is not an absolute barrier to entry - nation states or transnational terrorism groups like al-Qaida or even someone like the Russian Mafia, which is not terrorism but organised crime, could certainly raise that kind of money.\"</p> <p>Cyber Command was a step in the right direction, he says: \"They wanted to treat cyber[space] as an area for war like a physical space, which is exactly the way to look at it.\"</p> <p><strong>Rhetorical warriors</strong></p> <p>So is the suspension of Cyber Command going to make America more vulnerable? \"It's hard to answer,\" he says. \"I think having someone in charge and capable of handling the mission is needed urgently.\"</p> <p>Many blame political chicanery in the air force. After scandals about botched handling of nuclear weapons, major contracts going wrong and the firing of the top military and civilian leaders, the service needs time to regroup before deciding on how to fight in the cyber arena. But when and if it does come back online, there are still questions to be answered. </p> <p>Cyber Command has the right to monitor anything that comes across its own networks, for defence purposes, and there's no evidence it's going beyond that. Madden does say, however, that \"cases are turned over to law enforcement or counter-intelligence agencies for further investigation\".</p> <p>Scheier is worried about how rigorously the US government will maintain the line between military surveillance and civilian prosecutions. \"You don't want the military working with the FBI. That's how you get police states,\" he says. \"The army can't take charge of police work because there are laws against that, and the air force shouldn't be able to check up on civilian cybercrime. The needs of warfare are not the same as the needs of peacetime - we don't need howitzers and bombers in peacetime, and we don't need Cyber Command monitoring us either.\" Doesn't the war on terror justify it? \"They're lying if they say that,\" he says. \"They can pretend it's the same as war, but it's not. The war on terror is just a rhetorical war.\"</p>",
  "<p>Most people still look askance if you admit to using virtual worlds where you move around with an avatar or 3D version of yourself. It recalls the technophobic reactions in the early days of the internet. But attitudes may now change for two reasons. First, children are piling into their own virtual worlds, so their parents can get a glimpse of what it is all about. And second, a huger user base is being created, one that is accustomed to virtual worlds and is ready to trade up to more sophisticated ones as they grow older. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.Kzero.co.uk\">Kzero</a>, a web consultancy, has identified more than 30 virtual worlds targeted at children aged between eight and 13, and five more for under-eights. Some of the kids' sites have more registered (but not necessarily active) members than countries have citizens. These include <a href=\"http://www.habbo.co.uk/\">Habbo Hotel</a> (more than 100 million registered users), <a href=\"http://www.neopets.com/\">Neopets</a> (45 million) and <a href=\"http://www.clubpenguin.com/\">Disney's Club Penguin</a> (20 million). Up the scale there are spaces such as <a href=\"http://secondlife.com/\">Second Life</a> and <a href=\"http://www.hipihi.com\">hipihi.com</a> from China. Kzero reckons that there are about 100 million active users of virtual world.</p> <p>Second, virtual worlds are changing fast. Those in the pipeline are more simple to operate, more niche and starting to mimic the real world rather than recreating medieval themes or intergalactic escapism. Several, such as <a href=\"http://www.amazingworlds.com\">amazingworlds.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.twinity.com/en\">Twinity</a>, a German startup, are constructing virtual reproductions of cities including London, New York and Singapore. </p> <p>I have an apartment in Twinity's Berlin and was surprised how easy it was to import media. In one room there are videos from my YouTube collection running on a screen. In another my Flickr.com photo collection is on view. l also linked the screen to theguardian.com and was able to read the paper from inside the virtual world.</p> <p>What is the point of all this? It is quite likely that it will be a natural thing for future generations to meet their friends in worlds such as these, where they can watch the same music or videos while chatting to each other. And if that is where youngsters will be hanging out, then brands and media, including newspapers, will have to be there. Other life-mimicking worlds about to be released include shopping malls such as <a href=\"http://www.themall.tv\">themall.tv</a>, which aims to emulate an entire shopping mall with scores of high street shops. It claims to have signed up 500 brands.</p> <p>It reflects what Philip Rosedale, founder of the pioneering Second Life, calls the \"presence\", or magic, of virtual worlds. You could, he says, be browsing with 500 other people for the same product on Amazon, but you would be alone and unable to speak with them. Rosedale says virtual worlds are now branching out into different user models. Although many of the addictive networking features attached to them could, like Facebook and other social networks, migrate to mobile devices, they won't find it easy, he argues, to capture that immersive magic of virtual worlds.</p> <p>Second Life's unusual libertarian model - in which users can build everything from scratch - confirms it as the most creative of the virtual worlds, but also the most difficult. Rosedale admits it could take a \"day of total suffering\" to get used to it. Others would say weeks. But it offers opportunities for all, including older people, because, thanks to the anonymity of avatars, no one knows how old you are. Different generations can meet in a way they don't in real life.</p> <p>Rosedale dreams of setting up cafes with computers in developing countries, allowing poor people to work in SL earning Linden dollars (SL's currency), exchangeable into real money. Virtual worlds are only just beginning. During a period of financial collapse and worries about global warming, they could prove an ideal safe haven.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:vic.keegan@theguardian.com\">vic.keegan@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Recession warning signs were flashing for the UK economy yesterday after new figures showed factory output slumping.</p> <p>Economists said the downturn was clearly gathering pace and urged the Bank of England to cut interest rates when it meets next week, to prevent a deep and prolonged slump.</p> <p>The manufacturing sector last month suffered its biggest drop in output since records began in the early 1990s, the much larger service sector ceased growing in the three months to July, and shoppers are deserting out-of-town shopping centres in droves.</p> <p>The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply's keenly watched monthly snapshot of the manufacturing sector fell to its lowest level since the series began 16 years ago, showing that output is contracting sharply. The survey also showed a plunge in export orders, dashing hopes that firms could ship their way out of trouble while domestic sales slumped. Indeed, data from other countries suggested manufacturing output is falling in most major economies.</p> <p>\"Today's manufacturing data was shockingly weak. The headline, output, new orders, employment and purchases indices all fell to their lowest on record with respondents citing the ongoing turmoil in the housing and credit markets as the reason,\" said George Buckley, an economist at Deutsche Bank in London.</p> <p>\"As a result, we now expect the Bank of England to cut rates by a quarter point next Thursday,\" he added.</p> <p>The Bank has left rates on hold at 5% since April, preferring to focus on rising inflation. But the economy is worsening to such an extent that analysts think it will soon have to make deep cuts to borrowing costs to prevent a further downturn.</p> <p>Ford said yesterday that workers at its Southampton Transit Van plant would go on to a four-day week in response to the \"tough\" economic climate, and 125 temporary workers would be laid off.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics said output in the services sector had not grown at all in the three months to July - the worst performance in six years. The services sector accounts for about 70% of the economy. </p> <p>\"Today's data on the UK's manufacturing and services sectors provided the clearest signal yet that GDP contracted in Q3. In effect, the UK economy may already be in recession,\" said Paul Dales of Capital Economics. </p> <p>If that weren't bad enough, a report out today says that Britain's construction industry is facing a three-year slump after 13 years of unprecedented growth.</p> <p>The housebuilding sector is reeling from the impact of the global credit crunch, with housing starts running at the lowest level for 60 years, according to the Construction Products Association.</p> <p>The contagion from the financial market turmoil is spreading to other parts of the industry, with a dramatic fall in the construction of industrial buildings and the outlook for commercial development \"also looking exceedingly poor\", according to the CPA.</p> <p>The organisation is now expecting output to fall by 2% this year and by a further 5% in 2009, with the sector not showing a return to growth until 2011, at the earliest, and output still expected to be below 2007 levels in 2012.</p> <p>Michael Ankers, the CPA's chief executive, said: \"The forecasts are without doubt the gloomiest we have produced since compiling this information and have been downgraded from just three months ago to show the sharpest downturn since 1991.\"</p> <p>The CPA said the housing market bubble had burst, with private housing starts expected to fall by almost 40% this year, against 2007. It acknowledges government efforts to help the housing market, but said \"the underlying problem remains liquidity, coupled increasingly with a reluctance of first time buyers in particular to purchase in a falling market and at a time of less secure employment prospects.\"</p> <p>The CPA is forecasting that industrial output will fall 22% this year and a further 10% in 2009. It believes the commercial sector should grow this year before experiencing sharp falls over the next three years.</p> <p>Among the few bright spots for the sector, the CPA said that it expected infrastructure spending to carry on growing with the Olympic project, Crossrail and heavy spending in both the water and energy sectors helping to maintain demand.</p> <p>Consumers are avoiding out-of-town shopping centres as they struggle to rein back spending, according to the research group Experian, which counts shoppers going in and out of stores. It says shopper numbers at out-of-town retail warehouses - selling goods like furniture and carpets - are down 8% on a year ago.</p> <p>The number of people visiting fashion-dominated, out-of-town destination centres - like Bluewater in Kent - is down more than 3% on last year.</p> <p>The overall number of shoppers, however, is marginally up, suggesting that more people are shopping locally, more often, to save on petrol costs.</p> <p>The worst-hit regions are eastern England, where the number of shoppers is down 7.4% on last year, Yorkshire &amp; Humberside, the West Midlands and Scotland. Matthew Sherwood, a senior economist at Experian, predicted sales volumes would now tumble for a year. </p> <p>\"It will be early 2010 before volumes start picking up again in any sort of substantial fashion,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Tucked away beside the ornate entrance of the Savoy hotel in London are the discreet premises of ATS Bullion. Over the last few days staff there have witnessed an unprecedented phenomenon: queues. </p> <p>The customers are wary savers looking to build their own solution to the global financial crisis and the parlous state of the banking system. They are buying gold.</p> <p>\"There has been enormous demand,\" said Sandra Conway, managing director at ATS, one of the UK's leading gold coin and bar merchants. \"There are very few sellers of physical gold and we have actually had queues of people today.\"</p> <p>The world's makers of gold bars and gold coins are running flat out to try to keep up with this surge in demand, but stocks are dwindling, especially of Krugerrands. </p> <p>Named after Paul Kruger, who led the Boer resistance to the British at the turn of the 19th century, the coins were first minted in South Africa in 1967. Although it was illegal to import them into the UK during the 1970s and 1980s because of apartheid, they have become one of the most widely circulated gold coins in the world. But the \u00a3547 coins are becoming more scarce as investors snap them up.</p> <p>As a result, the Rand Refinery is now operating seven days a week, as is the Austrian mint, which produces the popular Vienna Philharmonic coin.</p> <p>The US Mint, responsible for ensuring an adequate supply of American coinage since 1792, has been forced to halt sales of its American Buffalo solid 24 carat gold coin because it was running out of supplies. It is also limiting the availability of its 22 carat American Eagle alternative.</p> <p>Canny investors had also noticed that both one ounce coins cost less than an ounce of gold on the open market at the time, making them incredibly tempting to anyone looking to make a quick return. Having broken through the $1,000 barrier earlier in the year, the gold price has retreated slightly and is now trading at around $880 an ounce. The 2007 American Eagle one ounce coin, however, was going for $789.95 while the 2006 Buffalo coin cost $800 - offering the potential for an instant return of $80-$90.</p>",
  "<p>Amazon got a head start in the cloud computing arena by launching <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/\">Amazon EC2</a> (Elastic Compute Cloud) where people can run applications without having to buy their own servers or set up their own networks. Now, says Amazon's <a href=\"http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2008/09/amazon_ec2_with_microsoft_wind.html\">Werner Vogels</a>: </p> <blockquote> <p>With <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/windows/\">today's announcement</a> that Microsoft Windows Server is available on Amazon EC2 we can now run the majority of popular software systems in the cloud. Windows Server ranked very high on the list of requests by customers so we are happy that we will be able to provide this. </p> </blockquote> <p><br><br>Vogels adds: \"In past weeks I met with a number of folks from the entertainment industry and often their first question was: when can we run on Windows?\" These folks have WMV videos, which makes me wonder if Amazon is going to support porn sites, where WMV is the standard. </p> <p>He also says: \"several customers would like to maintain a global single Windows-based desktop environment using Microsoft Remote Desktop\". I sincerely hope you never have to work for a company that thinks this is a good idea\u2026.</p> <p>While Amazon may assure us it is responding to customer demand, the fact is, the customer demand isn't new. However, what is new is that Microsoft is about to unveil a rival service, running Windows for Cloud Computing (unless they come up with a zappier name for a \"hypothetical Microsoft service possibly called Red Dog, or possibly not\").</p> <p>Suffice it to say, if you are going to Microsoft's <a href=\"http://www.microsoftpdc.com/\">Professional Developers Conference</a> in Los Angeles (October 27-30), then you'll be one of the first to see the Windows Cloud, as well as getting a free copy of Windows 7.</p> <p>As I also <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/may/08/microsoft.internet\">pointed out earlier</a> this year in the context of Live Mesh:</p> <blockquote> <p>Providing what is, in effect, an operating system for the web is going to take a lot of computer power, and Microsoft is building several $500m data centres. It has opened one near Seattle, is building others in Chicago and San Antonio, and plans one in Dublin. This is serious. </p> </blockquote> <p>Providing cloud services makes sense if you are already in the business of running giant server farms, as both Amazon and Google are. It isn't Microsoft's prime business, but it does run server farms to support Hotmail, Spaces, SkyDrive, Office Live and similar services, Microsoft Search, and Windows Update. It's also getting into the business of doing hosted CRM and Microsoft Exchange services, so it probably does have the economies of scale to be competitive.</p> <p>However, I don't expect Microsoft's offering to be cheap, for three reasons. <strong>First</strong>, I expect it will want to market the service via resellers and partners, so they get a cut of the profits; that adds to the price. <strong>Second</strong>, Microsoft won't want to make its offering so attractive that it makes a serious dent in corporate sales of server software. <strong>Third</strong>, it will be a Microsoft-based solution backed by Microsoft's huge cash resources, so it has the ability to squeeze rivals on price. It will therefore try hard not to do this, in order to stop the US Justice Department and EC from jumping on its neck. (Anti-trust actions are great for keeping prices up and adding to Microsoft's profits.)</p>",
  "<p>In the political debate over how and why to rescue Wall Street, the most controversial question is conceptual: should the US government save financial firms from their own bad assets?</p> <p>But another question is dividing economists and alarming accountants while sparking little public debate: should financial regulators relax rules that require bad assets to be valued at their current market rate?</p> <p>John McCain says yes. His economic adviser declared the Republican nominee \"pleased to see\" US regulators release a new rule yesterday allowing companies to avoid a declaration of massive losses by setting their own asset values during the worsening financial crisis.</p> <p>\"There is serious concern that these accounting rules are worsening the credit crunch, making it difficult for small businesses to stay afloat and squeezing family budgets,\" McCain adviser Douglas Holtz-Eakin said in a statement.</p> <p>Former banking regulator Bill Black has watched McCain's stance on so-called \"mark-to-market\" accounting rules since the presidential hopeful first criticised them days after the Bear Stearns collapse.</p> <p>His verdict on McCain's position is summed up in one sentence: \"It's Keating accounting all over again, and he doesn't see it.\"</p> <p>The Keating Five scandal nearly derailed McCain's career in 1989, as the mass collapse of savings-and-loan banks (S&amp;Ls) was pulling America into recession. McCain and four fellow senators faced an ethics inquiry after meeting with government regulators to discuss preferential treatment for financier Charles Keating's S&amp;L.</p> <p>An investigation following the scandal criticised but did not punish McCain, who now describes the episode as his motivation to reform government. Black, who was in the room during the Keating meeting, sees McCain's support for suspending mark-to-market as proof that the candidate has not learned his lesson.</p> <p>Instituted in November, mark-to-market rules require firms to value assets, such as the mortgage-based securities that lie at the heart of the credit crisis, according to their current value on the open market.</p> <p>Yet when the market for risky securities freezes up, as at present, marking to market can force the value of those assets artificially low in the short term. Businesses of all shapes and sizes can be forced to report punishing losses on their books.</p> <p>Since credit began contracting in the wake of the Bear Stearns failure, banking lobby groups have leaned on Congress to relax mark-to-market rules. McCain, who has blamed the economic blight on \"an inexcusable lack of financial transparency\", appears to have been swayed.</p> <p>\"The Keating Five was about calling regulators in the room and hammering them to back off,\" Black said. \"[Relaxing mark-to-market rules] is probably going to be about calling accountants in the room and pressuring them to screw with the accounting.\"</p> <p>Black, who now teaches law and economics at the University of Missouri in Kansas City, has not shrunk from publicly chiding McCain in the years following the Keating scandal. He is not the only financial expert who sees parallels between suspending mark-to-market and the S&amp;L debacle that ensnared McCain nearly 20 years ago.</p> <p>The Centre for Audit Quality (CAQ), which represents about 800 firms that audit public corporations, urged Congress yesterday to avoid replaying the S&amp;L crisis by suspending mark-to-market rules in its financial bail-out legislation.</p> <p>\"Many of the current requirements stem from the savings-and-loan crisis of the 1980s, when we learned that not knowing the real, current values of \u2026 instruments held by financial institutions can be devastating when the bubble finally bursts and institutions are forced to close their doors,\" the CAQ wrote in a letter to Capitol Hill.<br> Economists are split on the wisdom of the rules themselves, and even some supporters of mark-to-market accounting believe it cannot adequately function during the ongoing credit crisis. \"We have to get out of this current clogged environment in credit markets\" before a solution can be found, Jagadeesh Gokhale, a senior fellow at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute in Washington, said.</p> <p>Still, Gokhale agreed that a push to relax accounting standards helped fuel both the S&amp;L and the credit crises. Despite mark-to-market's role in driving down asset values, he warned, leaving companies to use their own internal values (sometimes called \"mark-to-model\") could run the risk of overly creative pricing.</p> <p>\"You can't argue for replacing mark-to-market without specifying an additional alternative,\" Gokhale said. \"But in principle, I think whatever that alternative turns out to be, it would be a deterioration.\"</p> <p>Christian Weller, a senior fellow at the liberal-leaning Centre for American Progress in Washington, is openly critical of marking-to-market.</p> <p>He echoed McCain's concern that the accounting rules are exacerbating the financial downturn, but offered a wry observation: \"The same people who are now asking for a temporary suspension of the rules didn't complain when they reaped the upside in the good years.\"</p> <p>Conservatives, from Newt Gingrich to the Wall Street Journal editorial board, are pressing for Congress to suspend the rules as part of any financial rescue plan taken up this week.</p> <p>The bail-out package that failed in the House of Representatives on Monday empowered the SEC to study the efficacy of marking-to-market. McCain is expected to support that proposal when it comes to a Senate vote tonight, but the calls for a total suspension are highly likely to continue.</p> <p>Barry Bosworth, an economics fellow at the non-partisan Brookings Institution, said he \"can see arguments for both positions\" in the mark-to-market debate. But the rules, Bosworth added, are nothing if not transparent \u2013 a trait that McCain has frequently said he finds lacking on Wall Street.</p> <p>\"There is a lot of uncertainty about how severe this problem is,\" Bosworth said, \"but it will [fall] into a black box if they suspend mark-to-market.\"</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/mojoblog/archives/2008/10/10032_mccain_campaign_hard_questions.html\">Hilarious write-up</a> from Jonathan Stein at MoJoBlog on a conference call with reporters the McCain campaign set up starring Rudy Giuliani.</p> <blockquote> <p>Moments ago, Rudy Giuliani took three questions on a McCain campaign conference call for the national press corps.</p> <p>The first question was about the bailout. Nothing notable.</p> <p>The second question was from someone named Chuck Pardee. Pardee asserted that Tina Fey, many reporters, and the Democrats make their living \"embellishing the facts.\" After criticizing the press for treating Sarah Palin unfairly, Pardee concluded:</p> <p>\"I guess my question is, do the American people want a straight-shooter or the fluff and stuff?\"</p> <p>Surprisingly, Giuliani said that the American people preferred the straight-shooter and John McCain just so happens to be one. Pardee, by the way, is the \"founder and president\" of Newsbull.com. He has donated the maximum $2,300 to McCain. It's a shock he didn't ask a tougher question. (And if you're wondering, yes, the McCain campaign knows the affiliations of reporters before they are permitted to ask a question on these conference calls.)</p> <p>The third and final question came from a woman named Sherry Riggs (sp?). Her affiliation was not announced. She took exception to Giuliani's claim from earlier in the call that Obama had never managed a budget. A hard-hitting question? Not really. Riggs insisted that Obama had indeed managed a budget \"with William Ayers\" when they both sat on the board of the Woods Fund years ago. According to Riggs, Obama and Ayers funded projects that were \"socialistic in nature\" with a $450 billion treasure chest. That seemed a bit high to me, but I'm sure the McCain campaign would only allow legitimate professionals to ask questions on these calls.</p> </blockquote> <p>And then the call ended. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.newsbull.com/default.asp\">Newsbull</a> looks like just an aggregator and bulletin board focused on pro-life issues. Interesting how someone who runs a site like that even gets press emails inviting him on to these calls, but stranger things have happened I guess. As for the Woods Fund of Chicago, the board on which Obama sat with Ayers, it's worth just a little less than $450 billion. The <a href=\"http://www.woodsfund.org/Folder_1042751691717/Folder_1207620197753\">2006 annual report</a> lists total assets of $58 million. But I guess I'm just being naive, because <em>obviously</em> they're not going to list in their annual report the $449.94 or so billion that they're secretly spreading around to worldwide socialistic and terrorist groups (note to Woods Fund: that's a joke intended at the expense of loopy right-wingers).</p> <p>Anyway, there's a reason Giuliani took just three questions, and actually only one journalistic question. From the <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2008/09/25/2008-09-25_rudy_giulianis_crass_opportunism_reflect.html\">New York Daily New</a>s:</p> <blockquote> <p>Rudy Giuliani is positioning his law firm to cash in on Wall Street's train wreck - a move that has become a gift to political enemies of his pal John McCain.<br> Even as the nation's $700 billion, taxpayer-funded Wall Street bailout was still being hashed out, the former mayor announced Thursday his high-powered law firm has set up a task force. Its mission: to help corporate clients get a piece of the action - or keep the federal wolves from the door. \"Our team of former government officials and experienced attorneys in the fields of legislation, enforcement and finance are equipped to guide institutions in this quickly evolving and complex environment,\" Giuliani noted in a press release from his law firm, Bracewell &amp; Giuliani. Giuliani is not the only one poised to profit from opportunities created by the mega-meltdown, but he is the most politically famous. Giuliani is a prime surrogate for Republican McCain, who has called the economic meltdown \"the greatest crisis since the end of World War II\" and has assailed Wall Street for \"unbridled </p> </blockquote> <p>greed.\" </p> <p>The News published this last Friday. Strange that Team McCain would want to use him so soon in its aftermath.<br></p>",
  "<p>Up here in Harlem, as the saying goes, it's all about the Benjamins. From <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kool_Mo_Dee\">Kool Moe Dee</a> to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_E._Fresh\">Doug E Fresh</a>, via <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/camron\">Cam'ron</a> and of course <br><a href=\"http://www.diddy.com/\">P Diddy</a>, New York's most celebrated rappers extol the virtues of possessing those little green bills bearing Benjamin Franklin's face. And now, standing on the precipice of an imminent financial catastrophe, today is certainly no exception.</p> <p>Above 110th Street, the painful exigencies of race, class and history are all inextricably linked. But from its lofty vantage point as the world's most famous historically black community, Harlem represents a unique lens through which to observe and gauge the effects of the current financial crisis in America. The <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2008/09/30/crashing_down/\">news</a> that the $700bn bail-out deal was rejected by Congress on Monday afternoon, and the subsequent $1tn <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/how-rejecting-700-billion-bailout/story.aspx?guid=%7B32B3D375-5D32-4DEA-B3F8-6DDA3FD54E79%7D&amp;dist=msr_1\">drop in stock prices</a> was greeted with mixed reactions here, reactions which are themselves a testament to the divergent demographics and ideologies now represented uptown.</p> <p>It would be churlish to deny that in the aftermath of the bail-out being rejected, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average suffering the biggest one-day drop in US history, the temperature of financial uncertainty here is soaring. Soon it will be more than the playful, ebullient children who'll be opening up the fire hydrants in order to cool off. Radios emit the voices of politicians, and TVs carrying up-to-the-minute financial analysis blare forth little else. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/sep/19/uselections2008.congress\">Charles Rangel</a>, the long-serving Democratic congressman of Harlem, said on Monday of the bail-out vote: \"The administration has come with a proposal that reminds me of roulette, and are challenging us to take the bullets. ... I will be supporting it. ... But those who have caused the problem have somehow managed to get away without any blame, any penalty.\" He subsequently voted yes, and in so doing voiced the feelings of many Harlemites who have been angered by the recklessness of Wall Street bankers that precipitated the crisis and yet are now fearful of the doleful shadow their actions have cast over the entire nation.</p> <p>Stephanie La Mothe, a waitress at the La Perle Noire caf\u00e9 remarked with an indifference suggesting a deeper cynicism about any promise of economic amelioration that gentrification might have hitherto alluded to: \"We all broke right now. Everyone gonna be riding bicycles up here soon, what with the price of gas. We always gonna be broke up here in this mutha****.\" Her vocabulary belied a grasp of harsh, on-the-ground fiscal realities, and articulated the sentiments of an impoverished populace struggling to make ends meet. Stephanie is the voice of those for whom the current financial predicament is simply nothing new.</p> <p>An even more pressing concern was articulated by Luceta Goodridge, 89, a proud Harlemite of over 40 years. While shopping at the supermarket, she expressed both dismay and consternation at the rising food prices. As someone who avidly scans the weekly flyers distributed by the competing supermarkets advertising their special offers, she has little doubt that she will still continue to hunt out the best bargains. Unfortunately, her search may now be even more tireless.</p> <p>Elsewhere, on 125th Street, Harlem's once infamous, now historic main thoroughfare, others haven't yet seen the impact of the nose-diving Dow Jones index or even the global credit crunch, and quite frankly don't expect to. It's business as usual for Mohammed, the Senegalese bootleg CD vendor. With the ever-enticing offer of three for $10 (driven by the competitive market forces of the other vendors further up the street), he is as busy as ever. \"Up here in Harlem, music is life. Always has been. That's what gets us through the day. Whatever happens on Wall Street, people will always wanna hear the latest tunes.\"</p> <p>Another key Harlem demographic fearing the worst and actively bracing for the fallout is the Buppies, the suited and booted, Blackberry browsing, New York Times perusing black professionals who have been moving into the neighbourhood since the mid-1990s. With a foreboding omniscience to accompany their MBAs and undergraduate degrees from <a href=\"http://www.ed.gov/about/inits/list/whhbcu/edlite-list.html\">HBCUs</a>, they are now crying havoc and running for cover.</p> <p>But what of the new breed of Harlemites, those who have recently arrived in droves on the crest of a wave of contentious gentrification? This new breed, with their penchant for organic food, fair trade coffee and reusable shopping bags, are an increasingly frequent sight in the neighbourhood. They stroll imperiously down Lenox Avenue and Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard showing little sign of being affected by the impending fiscal doom. Ensconced in their newly converted brownstones, they seem content to live out their dangerously urban, faux feral idylls. One woman I spoke to was far more concerned about finding a local bakery where she would be able to purchase freshly made, organic bread than the plummeting Dow Jones and the incipient economic meltdown. </p> <p>Conversely, one longtime Harlem resident, speaking for the majority, was dismayed at the changes in his community being brought about by gentrification. He was hopeful that the financial crisis would bring New York's house prices back down to Earth, thereby enabling Harlem residents to stay in the neighbourhood, at the expense of those newcomers who he believed were \"diluting the historic essence of the place\".</p> <p>One thing is certain. The entrepreneurial spirit of a proud yet indigent community will not be cowed by this financial crisis. Be it the twelfth grader selling his self-published book of poems door to door or the local unsigned rapper hawking his debut CD, the people of Harlem have undoubtedly endured worse and will survive with their hallmark mixture of fortitude, resilience and determination. </p> <p>The economics of change are ultimately always green, never black and white. It's merely the error due to parallax which makes us think otherwise. Harlem might be visibly changing, and in danger of losing part of its soul, but for now at least, amid these dire economic woes, it's still all about the Benjamins. Harlemites are now poised for the ensuing economic hardship. It's just that some, unfortunately, have far more to lose than others.</p>",

  "<p>Desperation can sometimes engender inspiration. During Monday night, the Irish government was facing the potential collapse of the Republic's banking system. Shares in Anglo Irish Bank had lost half their value in a single session, with similar sharp falls in other publicly listed Irish banks. Real concerns about the stability of Ireland's banking system \u2013 prompting a signal from the government a week earlier that it would \"intervene\" in the event of a <a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2008/0919/1221690003139.html\">bank collapse</a> \u2013 that had been percolating for months finally boiled over. </p> <p>By the close of trading, Ireland's ISEQ index had lost 13% of its value, its biggest one-day loss in more than 25 years, harking back to the days when Ireland was the economic basketcase of the western world and the IMF was poised to intervene. Then the US House of Representatives unexpectedly rejected the proposed $700bn bailout package to rescue the US financial sector.</p> <p>There was a real fear that Tuesday morning could bring the collapse of an Irish bank, and with it create a financial whirlpool that could drag down other banks that under normal conditions were considered sound. <br>After a series of <a href=\"http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/race-to-stop-the-banks--all-falling--like-dominoes-1486437.html\">intense negotiations</a> between the taoiseach, Brian Cowen, the finance minister, Brian Lenihan, Ireland's central bankers and financial regulators, and finally the chairman and chief executives of the Republic's two biggest banks, AIB and Bank of Ireland, a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/01/ireland.europeanbanks\">radical \u20ac400bn plan</a> to guarantee all retail deposits and loans in all Irish-owned banks was announced. </p> <p>The goal is to jumpstart international confidence in Irish banks, to help unfreeze interbank money markets and give potential lenders confidence based on the Irish government's guarantee.</p> <p>The details are yet to be approved by Ireland's parliament, the D\u00e1il, which <a href=\"http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1001/economy.html\">sits again tonight</a> in emergency session. Opposition parties are expressing scepticism of the deal, with the Labour party <a href=\"http://labour.ie/blog/archive/2008/09/30/tax-payers-have-been-left-carrying-the-can-for-a-decade-of-corporate-greed-says-gilmore/\">demanding</a> that any bank which avails itself of state aid be required to limit the compensation of its chief executive to the salary of Ireland's finance minister.</p> <p>Domestic reactions to the bailout scheme were broadly positive. Economist David McWilliams, noting that the key effect was to stabilise Irish banks in a stroke, <a href=\"http://www.independent.ie/opinion/columnists/david-mcwilliams/lenihans-masterstroke-has-bought-us-time-to-sort-out-our-own-problems-1486551.html\">called it a triumph</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>In time, <a href=\"http://www.independent.ie/topics/Brian+Lenihan\">Brian Lenihan's</a> move yesterday will be seen as a masterstroke and a practical blueprint for the new financial architecture which will emerge from this global crisis.</p> </blockquote> <p>There were <a href=\"http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/state-bailout-far-from-being-the-commercial-deal-cowen-claims-it-is-1486487.html\">warning voices</a> about the enormous risk potentially being taken on by the state \u2013 the \u20ac400bn commitment is more than twice Ireland's GDP and nearly 10 times its entire national debt \u2013 and critics on the left <a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2008/1001/1222724598726.html\">demanded</a> that the Irish taxpayer be compensated for the risk with an equity stake in the institutions.</p> <p>Other observers put the deal in its dramatic <a href=\"http://www.independent.ie/opinion/columnists/brendan-keenan/a-stroke-of-genius-perhaps-but-dont-bank-on-it-just-yet-1486438.html\">historical context</a>, comparing it to the Irish decisions \u2013 also born of desperation \u2013 to open up its economy, slash taxes and grab foreign investment, that led to the Celtic Tiger phenomenon of supercharged Irish economic growth in the 1990s through the early part of this decade.</p> <p>A few but growing number are worried about the <a href=\"http://www.thepropertypin.com/viewtopic.php?f=19&amp;t=13940\">international backlash</a>. The EU is certain to investigate the unfair advantage the deal gives Irish banks \u2013 attracting a huge capital inflow from British banks yesterday and not including banks only operating in Ireland, including RBS subsidiary Ulster Bank and Danske Bank's National Irish Bank, that will not be covered by the guarantee. Gordon Brown's spokesmen have already made their <a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2008/1001/breaking39.htm\">displeasure known</a>. </p> <p>But for a government that seemed impotent and paralysed in the wake of the defeat of the Lisbon European reform treaty referendum in June, the radical action has proven to most Irish observers that their government \u2013 unlike most others in the western world \u2013 is willing to try whatever it takes to get through this crisis.</p>",
  "<p>The world's richest man, Warren Buffett, is pumping $3bn into General Electric as part of a $15bn fundraising by the industrial conglomerate which is anxious to calm nerves about the health of its financial services arm.</p> <p>In a resounding vote of confidence, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway investment empire is buying preferred stock in GE. The deal is similar to the billionaire's $5bn leg-up to the Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs last week.</p> <p>\"GE is the symbol of American business to the world,\" said Buffett. \"They have strong global brands and businesses with which I am quite familiar. I am confident that GE will continue to be successful in the years to come.\"</p> <p>At the same time as issuing shares to Buffett, the company is offering $12bn of common stock to the public. GE's chief executive, Jeffrey Immelt, said the proceeds would help to protect the company's triple-A credit rating and could potentially fund acquisitions.</p> <p>\"First, it enhances our flexibility and allows us to execute on our liquidity plan even faster,\" said Immelt. \"Second, it gives us the opportunity to play offence in this market.\"</p> <p>GE is keen to reassure investors over the prospects for its finance division, GE Capital, which generated 45% of group profits last year. The size of the operation has raised questions about GE's exposure to the credit crunch, prompting a slide in the firm's shares in the market's recent sell-off of anything financial. GE Capital provides credit services to 130m customers including retailers, consumers, mortgage lenders and car dealers. Immelt described its activities last week as \"boring stuff\" with little connection to the exotic derivatives that have crippled the banking industry.</p> <p>But concern about the company sparked a 9% sell-off in GE's shares early today. After the company announced its fundraising early in the afternoon, the stock recovered ground but was still down 3.5% to $24.57 in late trading.</p> <p>The presence of Buffett on GE's share register is likely to provide encouragement for investors. The 78-year-old Nebraskan is one of America's most respected stock pickers and his words carry weight among millions of savers. Buffett warned for years of the dangers building elsewhere in the financial industry, describing derivatives as \"financial weapons of mass destruction\".</p> <p>\"He is the only major financial institution that has ready cash to buy cheap assets,\" said Tom Sowanick, chief investment officer at fund management firm Clearbrook Financial. \"You could actually call Buffett a mid-western vulture fund who is eating off the debris of the financial chaos.\"</p>",
  "<p>The initial proposal for an emissions trading scheme (ETS) had promised to cap carbon dioxide emissions from European business, to require firms to obtain permits for their emissions, and to encourage the trading of these permits so that companies that cut their emissions can sell permits to firms which emit more than their permitted amount.</p> <p>However, in practice, the scheme has been riddled with so many loopholes that, so far, the potential for big cuts in emissions <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/01/climatechange.carbonemissions\">has been lost</a>.</p> <p>The UK Treasury's recent <a href=\"http://media-newswire.com/release_1073596.html\">announcement</a> that it intends to auction a percentage of the permits is a welcome attempt to plug one of these holes \u2013 the practice of handing out pollution permits for free.</p> <p>The current system, where pollution permits are simply handed over to businesses on the basis of their current emissions, acts as an incentive for companies to increase their emissions in order to extract additional pollution permits in the next phase of the scheme. Forcing polluters to pay up-front for their pollution permits should give companies a much-needed financial incentive to cut their emissions and help restore confidence in a discredited system.</p> <p>However, the government will have to do much more and a lot more quickly if it wants to keep the ETS afloat.</p> <p>To date its performance has been sluggish and lacklustre. While countries such as Denmark auctioned the full 5% that was allowed in the first phase of the scheme \u2013 from 2003 to 2007 \u2013 the UK government sat on its hands.</p> <p>The Treasury must now make up the lost ground. This means auctioning the full 10% of permits allowed in this phase of the scheme. It also means introducing a windfall tax on the profits energy companies made by charging customers for pollution permits they received for free and using this money \u2013 an estimated \u00a35bn \u2013 to combat fuel poverty.</p> <p>However this should only be the start. Business will only start to make the necessary cuts in emissions if all the carbon dioxide they produce comes at a price. Negotiations for the next phase of the scheme \u2013 which runs from 2013 till 2017 \u2013 have already started and industry is lobbying against a major increase in the auctioning of permits. If the UK government genuinely wants to tackle climate change it must actively push for the next phase of the trading scheme to require that all permits are auctioned.</p> <p>But the government should not stop there. If the ETS is to work as an effective mechanism for driving down emissions, two other crucial changes need to be made.</p> <p>First, the overall level of emissions which Europe can produce is far too high. It must be set according to what the science says we can safely emit \u2013 not on the basis of what business are willing to accept.</p> <p>Second, companies must not be allowed to offset emissions by investing in projects in developing countries. While it is vital we help poorer countries develop low carbon economy this should not be at the expense of making cuts at home.</p> <p>The government has taken a step forward today but there is still a long way to go to get the emissions trading scheme back on track.</p>",

  "<p>A decision by the Old Town Ale House in Chicago to hang a painting of a naked Sarah Palin above the bar symbolises the crudely sexist voyeurism frequently encountered by the Republicans' first female vice-presidential candidate since her selection by John McCain.</p> <p>A video of Palin wearing a swimsuit at a 1984 Alaska beauty pageant, intense interest in her shoes and spectacles, and descriptions of her recent UN meetings with foreign leaders as \"speed dating\" point to a Neanderthal approach to women's rights that is still surprisingly common in the birthplace of feminism.</p> <p>Since her shock nomination in August, Palin's candidacy has thrown up a mirror to American life reflecting a host of uncomfortable home truths - and some positive ones, too. Palin has by turns been hyped, eulogised, patronised, ridiculed, and stereotyped in a way that few other politicians, except perhaps Hillary Clinton, have experienced in recent times.</p> <p>Love or hate her, the Palin phenomenon produces strong opinions. That is why <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/30/uselections2008.sarahpalin\">tonight's televised debate</a> with her Democratic rival <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a> is a must view for much of the nation.</p> <p>The vastly more experienced Biden faces a difficult job. If he is too aggressive, sympathy may switch to Palin. If he pulls his punches, he too will be accused of being patronising and sexist. All the same, since her selection it is Palin's own unforced gaffes and inarticulateness \u2013 not stereotyping and pigeon-holing - that have proven her worst enemy, despite Republican attempts to shield her.</p> <p>On foreign policy, Biden's strong point, there has been a series of slips, leading 57% of respondents in an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll to agree that Sarah Palin \"does not have enough experience and understanding of foreign and military issues to be president\".</p> <p>In recent CBS interviews, Palin said the US had already won in Iraq and that provided a template for other conflicts. \"A surge in Afghanistan will also lead us to victory there as it has proven to have done in Iraq,\" <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/25/AR2008092502171.html?nav=rss_nation\">she told interviewer Katie Couric</a>. Palin also told a voter in Philadelphia that she would happily send US troops into Pakistan to fight the Taliban and al-Qaida there, a statement that brought a gentle, pained disavowal from McCain.</p> <p>The Alaska governor has also raised eyebrows over Middle East policy, appearing to suggest that the US should not try to \"second guess\" Israel if it decided to bomb Iran's nuclear plants. That even put her at odds with the hawkish George Bush, who reportedly warned Israel's leadership recently that Washington would not support such an attack.</p> <p>As for Iran itself, Palin offered a less than penetrating analysis. \"It's obvious to me who the good guys are in this one and who the bad guys are. The bad guys are the ones who say Israel is a stinking corpse and should be wiped of the face of the earth.\"</p> <p>Palin's claim to have Russian expertise, because of Alaska's proximity to Vladimir Putin's fiefdom, has become a staple of late night television comedy. So, too, has the fact that she lacked a passport until last year. She rebutted that criticism by saying she had been too busy earning a living to go travelling round the world. \"I've worked all my life. In fact, I've usually had two jobs all my life until I had kids.\"</p> <p>On domestic and social issues, Palin's views, to the extent they are known, have also stirred up controversy. In her latest interview with Couric, she reiterated her opposition to abortion, even in the case of rape or incest - a tougher position than that taken by McCain. She said she supported contraception but not the morning-after pill, since \"I am one to believe that life starts at the moment of conception\".</p> <p>Palin also stuck to her guns on global warming, which she maintains is not necessarily caused by man-made carbon dioxide emissions. But in trademark style, she mixed up her words with unintended comical effect.</p> <blockquote> <p>I'm not going to solely blame all of man's activities on changes in climate, because the world's weather patterns are cyclical. And over history we have seen change there. But that kind of doesn't matter at this point, as we debate what caused it. The point is, it's real. We need to do something about it.</p> </blockquote> <p>Other recent embarrassments concern her apparent unfamiliarity with most supreme court landmark rulings and her inability to name any of McCain's previous Senate efforts in support of financial reform. At a time of national economic crisis, this latter failing has been particularly badly received.</p> <p>Dahlia Lithwick of Slate argues Palin's selection is self-defeating for the Republicans, reflecting in part the contentious question of affirmative action - a big issue this year given Democratic nominee Barack Obama's background. People who were given jobs for reasons other than merit ended up being victimised, <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2200928/\">Lithwick said</a>, and Palin is no different.</p> <p>\"Palin has become a recipient of the know-your-place treatment ... all of which smells of empty tokenism,\" Lithwick said. \"McCain has mastered the fine art of turning women into campaign accessories: flag pins with nice calves.\"</p> <p>All of which has lent tonight's debate a bizarre fascination. For good and bad reasons, in the Old Town Ale House in Chicago as elsewhere, all eyes are on Palin.</p>",
  "<p>The \"invisible hand\" of the market has got some explaining to do. Far from delivering its promise of transforming private greed into public good, it has catapulted us into an era of global financial turmoil, leaving many people beginning to wish that a rather more visible and accountable force were in charge of global economic affairs.</p> <p>Yet old habits die hard: the notion that finance should be free to set its own rules has been the mantra of most economists and politicians for several decades. Ironically, just at the time when we need it most, <a href=\"http://www.thenextright.com/patrick-ruffini/republicans-should-vote-against-the-bailout\">government action is unpopular and out of fashion</a>.</p> <p>One of the defining principles of New Labour has been its enthusiastic adoption of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/jan/29/labour.comment\">market ideology and corporate freedom</a>. Its high priest has been none other than Gordon Brown who, in his first act as chancellor, proudly <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/6/newsid_3806000/3806313.stm\">\"set free\" the Bank of England to fix interest rates</a>, and has since driven and promoted precisely the kind of financial deregulation that has led to the collapse of the world's financial markets.</p> <p>Beneath the new rhetoric of \"progressive politics\", all the signs are that the Tories remain committed to small government, with David Cameron recently remarking that over-reaction by the state could \"wreck\" financial markets. And as if there wasn't enough neoliberal consensus among the political parties already, just this week the Tories have been joined by the Liberal Democrats who, remarkably, have chosen the brink of recession as a time to declare that the role of state intervention is to be downgraded. Nick Clegg's proud conference <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/15/libdemconference.liberaldemocrats1\">commitment to cut public spending</a> is exactly the reverse of what is needed.</p> <p>The truth is that today we face not just a single crisis but three \u2013 a combination of a credit-fuelled financial meltdown, accelerating climate change, and soaring energy prices, underpinned by an encroaching peak in oil production \u2013 and only a combination of public intervention and regulation can begin to deal with them.</p> <p>That's why the Green party is supporting a <a href=\"http://www.greenparty.org.uk/\">Green new deal,</a> a Green version of <a href=\"http://history.howstuffworks.com/american-history/roosevelts-new-deal.htm\">President Roosevelt's New Deal</a> which, back in the early 1930s, helped the world emerge from economic depression. The Green new deal calls for the re-regulation of finance and taxation, linked to a transformational economic programme to substantially reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. At the same time, it would provide secure investments for pensions and savings, using that capital to kick-start a massive public and private works programme to cut energy use and create countless high quality, green-collar jobs.</p> <p>At its core would be a 21st-century project to make the nation's buildings truly energy efficient, as well as a revolution in renewable energies, to secure our energy supplies into the future, protect ourselves against oil price fluctuations, re-invigorate our manufacturing sector and seriously address climate change.</p> <p>But none of this can happen unless governments remember how to govern again. Although this call for the state to step in and do its job appears alien to our current political leaders, it chimes not only with decades of pre-Thatcher economic consensus, but also the expectations of a majority of voters. Finance is returned to its role as servant rather than master of the global economy; and we invest our taxes and encourage private savings into labour-intensive business opportunities that really protect the environment. That's the deal. That's the Green new deal.</p>",
  "<p>Last Friday the global \"war on terror\" took on a new twist as the US military embarked on a series of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/26/pakistan.usa\">fire fights</a> with nuclear-armed ally Pakistan. </p> <p>The strategic backdrop to these events highlights how Washington is failing to both identify and formulate effective policy prescriptions to the evolving security questions posed by al-Qaida's brand of non-state terrorism. Crucially both the recent series of UN meetings and the presidential debate on foreign policy failed to agree upon the limits of hard power in dealing with such entities in the 21st century. </p> <p>Indeed the BBC's latest report suggested that 22 out of 23 countries surveyed believed that the \"war on terror\" had <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7638566.stm\">not actually weakened</a> al-Qaida. This is a huge indictment of the failings of post-9/11 US foreign policy. The attacks were widely seen to be the foreign policy \"game changer\" of a generation. It gave the Bush administration an almost blank cheque to pursue military adventures abroad which only lost traction as they declined so spectacularly. As Senator Obama <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/09/27/america/27transcript.php\">outlined</a> on Friday \"We hadn't caught bin Laden. We hadn't put al-Qaida to rest \u2026 We took our eye off the ball\".</p> <p>Although al-Qaida's infrastructure in Afghanistan was widely seen to have been significantly degraded by the 2001 invasion, the global al-Qaida franchise has blossomed as US troops engaged in massive wars in Muslim countries. Nowhere is this truer than in Iraq. John McCain is right when he quotes bin Laden who called Iraq \"the most important site\" for al-Qaida \u2013 but the al-Qaida of Iraq is and never was the same as its Afghan-based version.</p> <p>What remained of the Afghan al-Qaida \u2013 including their talismanic senior leadership duo of bin Laden and Zawahiri \u2013 most likely fled to the \"tribal badlands\" of northern Pakistan. They moved from one semi-sovereign space to another \u2013 as it is where an absence of traditional government authority exists, that sub-state groups subscribing to supra-state ideologies are able to operate.</p> <p>An effective US policy towards Pakistan and the governance of its borderlands was far too long-sighted for a naive administration that was focused on the immediate objective of overthrowing the Taliban, whilst continuingly obsessing with invading Iraq. That bin Laden was able to escape from the conventional \"showdown\" in Tora Bora and flee to the tribal north of Pakistan only highlighted the flaws in US policy. How to remove the strategic depth of the Taliban and al-Qaida elements without endangering the strategic, but not democratically legitimate, rule of President Musharraf over a nuclear armed country of over 172 million people? </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federally_Administered_Tribal_Areas\">Federally Administrated Tribal Areas</a> (FATA) have become a kind of Mordor for western policy makers. It is a wild west of harsh conservative tribes who live by the Deobandi interpretation of strict Islamic law, and do not take kindly to government control. Some 3.5 million people live in this sovereign \"no mans land\", 70% are unemployed and two-thirds live in poverty. Yet instead of trying to improve conditions, the US-Musharraf policy has shown total inconsistency by oscillating between ceding tribal leaders more power and sending in large troop numbers to <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7638157.stm\">attack the area</a>.</p> <p>The most recent government offensive against their own people saw 260,000 residents forced to flee in response to heavy air strikes. As security analysts frequently articulate, the Pakistani army is one that is prepared to wage a conventional war against India but struggles when fighting an internal conflict with itself. The undefined links between the Pakistani intelligence service and the Taliban is evidence again of the blurring of relationships across this dangerous geographical area.</p> <p>Pakistan was one of only two countries surveyed by the BBC that did not hold a majority negative perception of al-Qaida. The issue of Pakistan is one of clear divergence between the presidential candidates concerning their policy towards the tribal areas. Where Obama has stated that he would favour <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lionel-beehner/bush-embraces-obama-doctr_b_127097.html\">hot pursuit</a> into northern Pakistan, McCain is more reticent, recognising that \"this area on the border has not been governed since the days of Alexander the Great\". With the shift in foreign policy priorities from Iraq to Afghanistan likely to continue after November 4, Obama supporters should look to challenge whether their man's policy will increase or decrease support for bin Laden's ideology.</p>",
  "<p>British Airways chief executive Willie Walsh has slammed Tory plans to replace a third runway at Heathrow airport with a high-speed rail network and described the party's aviation policy as \"all over the place\".</p> <p>Walsh said a high-speed route linking Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds to London through a 180mph rail service would not address capacity problems at Britain's largest airport. He added that Tory airport policy was riddled with inconsistencies, with some in the party opposed to all airport expansion, some in favour of a third runway and another wing - led by the London mayor Boris Johnson - in favour of building a new hub airport in the Thames estuary.</p> <p>\"The latest idea that a rail link from Leeds and Manchester to Heathrow would be an adequate substitute for a third runway beggars belief,\" he said in a speech at the Institute of London Insurance this afternoon. He added: \"So the Conservatives apparently want to undermine the UK's efforts to succeed in a global economy - and condemn Heathrow to permanent status as the most delay-prone airport in Europe.\"</p> <p>Walsh is optimistic that a Conservative government under David Cameron will change its mind over Heathrow, particularly if business leaders get their way, but today's speech reflects increasing frustration at BA over Cameron's refusal to listen to the case for expansion. </p> <p>A proposal to expand Heathrow by increasing the number of flights at the airport, followed by the opening of a third runway in 2020, is the subject of a public consultation. A final verdict is not expected until December but the government is expected to reiterate its aviation policy and endorse Heathrow expansion.</p> <p>\"The Conservatives may have an election to win. But they must not forget that if they are successful, they will have a country to govern,\" said Walsh. Echoing comments by Heathrow's owner, BAA, Walsh said he would welcome a high-speed rail link to Heathrow but stressed that it would be \"complementary\" to air travel and not a replacement for it. </p> <p>The BA boss has pledged to scrap the airline's domestic services to Heathrow if a high-speed link acts as an alternative \"feeder\" service for BA's long-haul routes, by transporting passengers from outside London to its main hub.</p> <p>Stephen Hammond, the shadow transport minister, said BA was \"not a disinterested party\" in the debate and rejected Walsh's claim that choosing high-speed rail over airport expansion will be bad for the economy.</p> <p>\"We are disappointed that Mr Walsh has taken that attitude. We have spent a year working with leading railway and funding experts and we know that it is fundable. It stacks up in economic and environmental terms.\"</p>",
  "<p>Don't worry about the broken society, it is quite incredible how quickly things get fixed in Cameron's Britain. </p> <p>Yesterday, Peter Ainsworth, the Tory environment spokesman, was on crutches hobbling around the Birmingham conference with one leg suspended, as if he had suffered a really serious injury.</p> <p>But today, Ainsworth sprung onto the stage with the rest of the shadow cabinet without even a hint of a limp. Striding towards his seat with confidence he then leapt up two steps, like a mountain goat, to his allotted place.</p> <p>Cameron went on to say he didn't have \"miracle cures\" for anything, but this was an impressive turnaround indeed.</p>",

Brown's experience had created a massive increase in national debt and a huge rises in taxes, Cameron said, vowing to end the prime minister's \"spendaholic culture\". </p> <p>\"The risk is not in making a change. The risk is sticking with what you've got and expecting a different result. There is a simple truth for times like these. When you've taken the wrong road, you don't just keep going. You've got to change direction.</p> <p>\"These difficult times need leadership, yes. They need character and judgment. The leadership to unite your party and build a strong team, the character to stick to your guns and not bottle it when times get tough, the judgment to understand the mistakes that have been made, and to offer the country change.</p> <p>\"Leadership, character, judgment. That's what Britain needs at a time like this and that's what this party now offers.\"<br> James Callaghan had held all four great offices of state, Cameron said. \"He had plenty of experience. But thank God we changed him for Margaret Thatcher.\"</p> <p>The address, lasting 65 minutes, was short on policy but strong on the twin themes of change and responsibility. Cameron insisted that the Conservative party had changed because it knew it had to make itself \"relevant to the 21st century\".</p> <p>\"We are a changed party and we are a united party,\" he said.</p> <p>Unlike last year, when Cameron walked around the stage and spoke without notes, the Tory leader stood behind a lectern.</p> <p>He did not copy Brown's example of being introduced by his wife, but she joined him on stage at the end of the speech in Birmingham's Symphony Hall.</p> <p>He paid tribute to her, and in a section on how much he admired entrepreneurs he added: \"I go to bed with one every night.\"</p> <p>Cameron heaped praise on British forces in Afghanistan and said he was a \"deeply patriotic\" person who wanted to be prime minister of the United Kingdom and not just England, in a speech that focused on core Tory values.</p> <p>But Cameron said the thing he most wanted to achieve in government was social reform.</p> <p>\"The central task I have set myself and this party is to be as radical in social reform as Margaret Thatcher was in economic reform. That's how we plan to repair our broken society.\"</p> <p>Strengthening families, school reform and overhauling the welfare system was key to stemming social breakdown.</p> <p>Cameron revived his dispute with Brown, and with Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, over his claim that Britain is a \"broken\" society.</p> <p>\"Some say our society isn't broken. I wonder what world they live in,\" the Tory leader said.</p> <p>On education, in one of the best-received passages of the speech, Cameron said that the straightforward truth was that there were not enough good schools.</p> <p>\"Any government I lead will not go on excusing this failure,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The election of a Conservative government will bring - and I mean this almost literally - a declaration of war against those parts of the education establishment who still cling to the cruelty of the 'all must win prizes' philosophy and the dangerous practice of dumbing down.\"</p> <p>On welfare, Cameron promised to end the \"something-for-nothing culture\".</p> <p>In a tough message to claimants, he said: \"If you don't take a reasonable offer of a job, your lose benefits. Go on doing it, you'll keep losing benefits. Stay on benefits and you'll have to work for them.\"</p> <p>Cameron embarked on a major rewrite of his speech in the wake of the deepening global financial crisis and his unscheduled speech yesterday offering the government bipartisan support.</p> <p>But the Tory leader made it clear today that his pledge to put party politics aside on the economy would not stop him challenging the prime minister on other issues.</p> <p>Hitting back at Brown's \"novice\" quip. Cameron threw back at him what Brown regards as his own great strength - a decade of running the economy.</p> <p>\"To do difficult things for the long term, or even to get us through the financial crisis in the short term, it's not experience we need, it's character and judgment. To rebuild our economy, it's not more of the same we need, but change.\"</p> <p>But he warned: \"I'm a man with a plan, not a miracle cure.\" And he accepted that he could not prove ahead of the election that he would be a good prime minister.</p> <p>\"It would be arrogant to pretend you can. The best you can do is tell people who you are and the way you work, how you make decisions and then live with them.\"<br> Developing his promise to help Britain get through the current economic crisis, Cameron vowed to rein in government borrowing.</p> <p>\"Sound money means saving in the good years so we can borrow in the bad,\" he said.</p> <p>\"It means ending Labour's spendaholic culture, it means clamping down on government waste and it means destroying all those useless quangos and initiatives.\"</p> <p>His shadow cabinet will be tasked with reviewing every spending programme to see if it is really necessary.</p> <p>Cameron also made clear the Tory aspiration of an overall cut in taxes may have to wait a long time - and may even be replaced by tax rises.</p> <p>\"I know it's your money. I know you want some of it back,\" the Tory leader said.</p> <p>But he added: \"We will only cut taxes once it's responsible to do so once we've made government live within its means.\"</p> <p>The test of whether the Conservative party was ready for government was not whether it could come up with exciting shadow budgets, he said.</p> <p>\"It is whether we have the grit and determination to impose discipline on government spending, keep our nerve, and say 'no' - even in the teeth of hostility and protest. That is the responsible party we are and that is the responsible government I will lead,\" Cameron pledged.</p> <p>He said that when times were tough, it was not a bigger state Britain needed, it was better, more efficient government.</p> <p>Accusing the Labour government of \"treating people like children\", the Tory chief said it had presided over a health-and-safety, Human Rights Act culture that had infected every part of life.</p> <p>\"When we look at what's happening to our country, we can see that the problem is not the leader, it's Labour,\" Cameron said. \"They end up treating people like children, with a total lack of trust in people's common sense and decency.\"</p> <p>Cameron began the speech by underlining his pledge yesterday to work with the government to help protect Britain from the worst of the fallout from the financial crisis.</p> <p>In times of great anxiety, people wanted to know what values he would bring to big situations that arose, he said.</p> <p>\"My values are Conservative values,\" he said. \"For me, the most important word is responsibility. Personal responsibility, professional responsibility, civic responsibility, corporate responsible ... Social responsibility, not state control. Because we know that we will only be a strong society if we are a responsible society.\"</p> <p>He said the Conservatives were a progressive party but they understood that real change was best achieved through Conservative means.</p> <p>\"This is the big argument in British politics today,\" he said. \"When the call comes for a politics of dignity and aspiration for the poor and the marginalised ... it is this party ... that will achieve those great and noble progressive ends of fighting poverty, extending opportunity, and repairing our broken society.\"</p>",
  "<p>Physics in the UK is in good health, despite concerns over the numbers of schoolchildren and students taking up the subject, a new report has found.</p> <p>Physics research is particularly healthy, the government-commissioned report found, just months after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/dec/11/research.highereducation\">fears over the funding of physics</a> were raised.</p> <p>But physics still faces \"enormous challenges\", educationally speaking. \"The numbers of students taking the subject at school level have fallen over many years, with A-level numbers a particular cause for concern,\" the report said.</p> <p>\"The number of physics departments has also declined over the last 10 years, meaning that the discipline is primarily concentrated in the older traditional research-based universities.</p> <p>\"The low percentages of female and ethnic minority students are a worry,\" it added.</p> <p>The review, led by Prof Bill Wakeham, vice-chancellor of the University of Southampton, considered the international standing, funding arrangements, university provision, school education, careers and skill supply of physics in the UK.</p> <p>There has been a modest increase in undergraduate numbers between 2002 and 2005, high average citation rates within academic publications, and high global standing in areas including astrophysics and solar system research, the panel concluded.</p> <p>But it wants the government to put more effort into improving the take-up of physics in schools, particularly among those from wider social and ethnic backgrounds.</p> <p>It also concluded that funds for undergraduate teaching of physics are inadequate to \"ensure long-term survival in many universities\", despite an additional \u00a375m over three years from the English funding council, Hefce.</p> <p>The panel believes that researchers still help decide how research money is spent. But it said the government's director general of science and research would \"benefit from the advice of a small, but well-informed advisory group from outside the Department of Innovation, Universities and Skills during the comprehensive spending review allocation process to ensure there are no unintended consequences of allocations and to ensure appropriate accountability to the science community\".</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/review/physics/interview.htm\">Wakeham said</a>: \"UK physics is strong but faces important challenges. Physics in the UK has seen significant changes over the last 20 years, and the community must be confident that the current configuration serves the best interests of the UK.</p> <p>\"UK physics enjoys excellent international standing and the role of physics and physicists is vital for other disciplines.</p> <p>\"A significant proportion of physics research takes place in non-physics departments. This provides evidence of both the pervasiveness of the discipline and the flexibility of physicists, but physics departments need to make sure that they maintain intellectual ownership of some parts of their discipline.<br> \"The value of physics to the UK is such that relative weaknesses in its structures and in the skills pipeline must be addressed. We have identified these areas, so it is now a case of strengthening them so that UK physics can continue to grow in stature.\" Prof Ian Diamond, chair of the research councils' executive group, said the report would be invaluable in assessing the future direction for UK physics.</p> <p>The president of the Institute of Physics, Prof Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell, said the review was not expected to resolve the concerns raised over funding of physics research.</p> <p>But if the recommendations for greater consultation with the science community on funding and for specific funding for particle physics and astronomy facilities and research grants were acted upon, they \"should go a long way to ensure that we do not encounter similar difficulties in the future\", she said.</p> <p>\"We are also very pleased to see key recommendations emphasising the need to continue funding both basic and applied research, to encourage more young people to study physics through the provision of more physics\u2013trained teachers and to undertake research into the factors influencing the relatively low take-up of physics from wider social and ethnic backgrounds and from women.\"</p> <p>John Denham, the universities secretary, said: \"I am pleased to see that the report's first conclusion is that physics in the UK was performing strongly internationally.</p> <p>\"The government, through the research councils, remains committed to investing in the variety of physics disciplines to maintain this position.</p> <p>\"Public funding for science is now at its highest ever, increasing from \u00a33.4bn per year this year, to almost \u00a34bn by 2011. As part of this, over the past five years, funding for physics has increased from \u00a3460m to \u00a3616m.</p> <p>\"This level of spending on physics at a time when overall government spending is tightly rationed indicates the priority we attach to the discipline.\"</p>",

It's worth looking in this light at his <a href=\"http://www.anglican-nig.org/main.php?k_j=12&amp;d=239&amp;p_t=index.php?\">presidential address to the Church of Nigeria</a> this week, perhaps because it makes him the only world spiritual leader to have denounced a case of sheep-shagging in Bromley. </p> <blockquote> <p>As a Church we cannot but continue to decry the disturbing level of moral decadence and spiritual degradation eating deep into the soul of western societies. In the United Kingdom, all through Europe and in ever increasing number of states in America, lgislators make laws to upturn the natural order and throw God away from the public domain. Marriage and family life as we know them in the word of God have been jettisoned. People of the same sex are legally permitted to marry. Parents' right to discipline their children is legally denied.</p> <p>As if these are not bad enough, only last week the TELL magazine reported in its 36th edition on page 12 that a 27 year old man was arrested for having sex with a sheep in Dulwich, south east London.</p> </blockquote> <p>That story <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2306848/Man-arrested-over-sheep-sex-attacks.html\">is almost true</a>, by the way, though the only place on the net where people have got as upset about it as the Church of Nigeria is a neo-Nazi bulletin board, to which I will not link. </p> <p>Akinola also wants an end to religious toleration, at least as it extends to Muslims in the west. Here's what he had to say on that subject: </p> <blockquote> <p>Hiding under the principle of 'political correctness' Satan has misled many to deny the reality of sin and God's final judgment ... The western world is not only losing its Judaeo-Christian heritage from which it received its civilisation; it is fast becoming antichrist and anti-Church.</p> <p>For Muslims in Britain, it is no longer a matter of asking to be tolerated or begging for equal treatment. Today, Muslims are given preferential treatment. They build mosques in most prime areas and strategic locations in the city of London. It has been reported that it is likely, Muslims might be allowed to introduce sharia law in the UK. And if you must know, Islamic banking has already begun in the UK!</p> <p>But what do Christian minorities in Muslim societies face every day of their life? They may cry and beg for tolerance ad infinitum \u2013all they'll get is persecution and in many instances face the danger of extinction. In general, Muslims have been unable to give to Christian minorities in their domain the sort of freedom and space they enjoy in Christian societies. Thus, they do not tolerate Christian presence nor is there reciprocity.</p> </blockquote> <p>What is to be done about this? His answer seems to me quite clear: British Muslims must suffer as Iraqi or Pakistani Christians do. Otherwise it's not fair and \"Religious tolerance [becomes] a one sided principle that favours one particular religion and inimical to the other. [But] What is good for the goose is good for the gander. It is only if we all embrace the divine injunction: 'do unto others, as you want them do unto you' that we can truly and in all sincerity preach peaceful coexistence and religious tolerance.\"</p> <p>If I have followed his reasoning, he is claiming that since \"we all\" \u2013 ie \"you Muslims\" \u2013 have not embraced this divine injunction, they must themselves be treated as they treat others, and Christians can no longer preach peaceful coexistence and religious tolerance.</p> <p>This is the logic of <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200803/nigeria\">ethnic cleansing</a> and civil war and it is coming from <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200311/jenkins\">a man</a> who is <a href=\"http://www.thirdwaymagazine.com/404\">taken very seriously</a> by millions of <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article2026348.ece\">otherwise respectable</a> Christians. There is more here at stake than the good name of Bromley as a borough where sheep may safely graze.</p>",
  "<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>It's great to be here in the Symphony Hall. But it's even better to know that in this party, everyone: the Shadow Cabinet, the Members of Parliament, the council leaders and all our candidates and colleagues. Everyone is playing the same tune.</p> <p><strong>THE FINANCIAL CRISIS</strong></p> <p>Today the financial crisis means that all eyes are on the economy and the financial markets and that is absolutely right. As I said yesterday, on this issue, we must put aside our differences and work together with the government in the short-term to ensure financial stability. I am pleased that our proposal to increase the protection for depositors to \u00a350,000 has been taken up. I'm pleased that the European regulators are looking at our proposal to bring stability to the banking system. I repeat: we will not allow what happened in America to happen here, we will work with the government in the short term in order to protect our economy. But as I also said yesterday, that must not stop us telling the truth about the mistakes that have been made. It is our political duty and if we had a written constitution I would say constitutional duty to hold the government to account, to explain where they went wrong, and how we would do things differently to rebuild our economy for the long-term.</p> <p>So we must not hold back from being critical of the decisions that over ten years have led us to this point. We need to learn the lessons, and to offer the British people a clear choice. It is our responsibility to make sense of this crisis for them, and to show them the right way out of it. We started to do that in Birmingham this week. We've had a good conference this week, an optimistic conference - but a sober one. We understand the gravity of the situation our country is in. And our response is measured, proportionate and responsible. The test of a political party is whether it can rise to the challenge of what the country requires and what the times demand. I believe we have passed that test this week and I want to thank George Osborne, William Hague, all my team in the Shadow Cabinet and all of you for making this conference a success. The reality of government is that difficulties come not in neat and predictable order, one by one and at regular intervals. Difficulties come at you from all sides, one on top of the other, and you've got to be able to handle them all. So amidst this financial crisis let us not forget that we are also a nation at war.</p> <p><strong>AFGHANISTAN</strong></p> <p>In Afghanistan today, our armed forces are defending our freedom and our way of life as surely and as bravely as any soldiers in our nation's history. Let us be clear about why they are there: if we fail in our mission, the Taliban will come back. And if the Taliban come back, the terrorist training camps come back. That would mean more terrorists, more bombs and more slaughter on our streets. That is why we back our troops' mission in Afghanistan one hundred per cent. I've been to visit them every year since I've been doing this job. Earlier this month, up the Helmand River in Sangin I met a soldier in the Royal Irish Regiment, Ranger Blaine Miller. He'd just turned eighteen years old. He was the youngest soldier there. He's not much more than a boy and he's there in the forty-five degree heat, fighting a ferocious enemy on the other side of the world. I told him that what he was doing was exceptional. He told me he was just doing his job.</p> <p>Every politician says it's the first duty of government is to protect our country, and of course that's right. But today we are not protecting the people, like Blaine, who protect us - and that is wrong. In Afghanistan, the number of our troops has almost doubled but the number of helicopters has hardly increased at all. American soldiers start their rest and recuperation the day they arrive back home, our troops have to count the days they spend getting home. We've got troops' families living in sub-standard homes; we've got soldiers going into harm's way without the equipment they need we've got businesses in our country that instead of welcoming people in military uniform and honouring their service choose to turn them away and refuse them service. That is all wrong and we are going to put it right. We are going to stop sending young men to war without the equipment they need, we're going to stop treating our soldiers like second class citizens we will do all it takes to keep our country safe and we will do all it takes to protect the heroes who risk everything for us.</p> <p><strong>GURKHAS</strong></p> <p>And today there are a particular group of heroes that I have in mind. They fought for us in the slit trenches of Burma the jungles of Malaya and the freezing cold of the Falklands. Yesterday the courts ruled that Gurkhas who want to come and live in Britain should be able to. They risked their lives for us and now we must not turn our backs on them. I say to the government: I know there are difficult questions about pensions and housing but let's find a way to make it work. Do not appeal this ruling.<br>Let's give those brave Gurkha soldiers who defended us the right to come and live in our country.</p> <p><strong>VALUES AND CHARACTER</strong></p> <p>These are times of great anxiety. The financial crisis. The economic downturn. The cost of living. Big social problems. I know how worried people are. They want to know whether our politics, and let's be frank, whether our politicians - are up to it. In the end, that's not really about your policies and your plans. Of course your plans are important but it's the unexpected and unpredicted events that can dominate a government. So people want to know what values you bring to big situations and big decisions that can crop up on your watch. And people want to know about your character: the way you make decisions; the way that you operate.</p> <p><strong>RESPONSIBILITY</strong></p> <p>My values are Conservative values. Many people wrongly believe that the Conservative Party is all about freedom. Of course we care passionately about freedom from oppression and state control. That's why we stood up for Georgia and wasn't it great to have the Georgian Prime Minister with us here, speaking today? But freedom can too easily turn into the idea that we all have the right to do whatever we want, regardless of the effect on others. That is libertarian, not Conservative - and it is certainly not me.</p> <p>For me, the most important word is responsibility. Personal responsibility. Professional responsibility. Civic responsibility. Corporate responsibility. Our responsibility to our family, to our neighbourhood, our country. Our responsibility to behave in a decent and civilised way. To help others. That is what this Party is all about. Every big decision; every big judgment I make: I ask myself some simple questions. Does this encourage responsibility and discourage irresponsibility? Does this make us a more or less responsible society? Social responsibility, not state control. Because we know that we will only be a strong society if we are a responsible society.</p> <p><strong>CHARACTER</strong></p> <p>But when it comes to handling a crisis when it comes to really making a difference on the big issues it's not just about your values. There's something else people want to know. When people ask: \"will you make a difference?\" they're often asking will you \u2013 i.e. me \u2013 will you make a difference? You can't prove you're ready to be Prime Minister \u2013 and it would be arrogant to pretend you can. The best you can do is tell people who you are and the way you work; how you make decisions and then live with them.</p> <p>I'm a forty-one year old father of three who thinks that family is the most important thing there is. For me. For my country. I am deeply patriotic about this country and believe we have both a remarkable history and an incredible future. I believe in the Union of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and I will never do anything to put it at risk. I have a simple view that public service is a good way to channel your energy and try to make a difference. I am not an ideologue. I know that my party can get things wrong, and that other parties sometimes get things right. I hold to some simple principles. That strong defence, the rule of law and sound money are the foundations of good government</p> <p>But I am also a child of my time. I want a clean environment as well as a safe one. I believe that quality of life matters as much as quantity of money. I recognise that we'll never be truly rich while so much of the world is so poor. I believe in building a strong team \u2013 and really trusting them. Their success is to be celebrated \u2013 not seen as some kind of threat. Thinking before deciding is good. Not deciding because you don't like the consequences of a decision is bad. Trust your principles, your judgment and your colleagues. Go with your conviction, not calculation. The popular thing may look good for a while. The right thing will be right all the time. Tony Blair used to justify endless short-term initiatives by saying \"we live in a 24 hour media world.\"</p> <p>But this is a country not a television station. A good government thinks for the long term. If we win we will inherit a huge deficit and an economy in a mess. We will need to do difficult and unpopular things for the long term good of the country. I know that. I'm ready for that.</p> <p><strong>EXPERIENCE</strong></p> <p>And there is a big argument I want to make \u2013 about the financial crisis and the economic downturn, yes but about the other issues facing the country too. It's an argument about experience. To do difficult things for the long-term or even to get us through the financial crisis in the short term what matters more than experience is character and judgment, and what you really believe needs to happen to make things right. I believe that to rebuild our economy, it's not more of the same we need, but change. To repair our broken society, it's not more of the same we need, but change.</p> <p>Experience is the excuse of the incumbent over the ages. Experience is what they always say when they try to stop change. In 1979, James Callaghan had been Home Secretary, Foreign Secretary and Chancellor before he became Prime Minister. He had plenty of experience. But thank God we changed him for Margaret Thatcher.</p> <p>Just think about it: if we listened to this argument about experience, we'd never change a government, ever. We'd have Gordon Brown as Prime Minister \u2013 for ever.</p> <p>Gordon Brown talks about his economic experience. The problem is, we have actually experienced his experience. We've experienced the massive increase in debt. We have experienced the huge rise in taxes. We experienced the folly of pretending that boom and bust could be ended. This is the argument we will make when the election comes. The risk is not in making a change. The risk is sticking with what you've got and expecting a different result. There is a simple truth for times like this. When you've taken the wrong road, you don't just keep going. You change direction \u2013 and that is what we need to do. So let's look at how we got here \u2013 and how we're going to get out.</p> <p><strong>HOW WE GOT HERE</strong></p> <p>At the heart of the financial crisis is a simple fact. The tap marked 'borrowing' was turned on - and it was left running for too long. The debts we built up were too high. Far too high. The authorities \u2013 on both sides of the Atlantic \u2013 thought it could go on for ever.</p> <p>They thought the days of low inflation and low interest rates could go on for ever. They thought the asset price bubble didn't matter. But it's not just the authorities who were at fault. Many bankers in the City were quite simply irresponsible. They paid themselves vast rewards when it was all going well and the minute it went wrong, they came running to us to bail them out. There will be a day of reckoning but today is not that day. Today we have to understand the long-term policy mistakes that were made.</p> <p>In this country, Gordon Brown made two big mistakes. His first big mistake \u2013 and his worst decision, sowing the seeds of the present financial crisis was actually contained within his best decision: to make the Bank of England independent.</p> <p>Let me explain. At the same time as giving the Bank of England the power to set interest rates he took away the Bank of England's power to regulate financial markets. And he took away the Bank of England's power to blow the whistle on the total amount of debt in the economy. He changed the rules of the game, but he took the referee off the pitch. Eddie George, who was the Bank of England Governor at the time, was only given a few hours notice of this massive decision. He feared it would end in tears \u2013 and it has.</p> <p>Gordon Brown's second big mistake was on government borrowing. After a prudent start, when he stuck for two years to Conservative spending totals, he turned into a spendaholic. His spending splurge left the government borrowing money in the good times when it should have been saving money. So now that the bad times have hit, there's no money to help. The cupboard is bare.</p> <p><strong>HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET OUT</strong></p> <p>So the question is, how are we going to get through this crisis? How are we going to rebuild our economy for the long term? Now I've studied economics at a great university. I've worked in business alongside great entrepreneurs. And as Gordon Brown never stops reminding people, I've been inside the Treasury during a crisis. But when it comes to handling the situation we're in, none of that matters as much as some simple things I believe to be true.</p> <p><strong>SOUND MONEY</strong></p> <p>First of all, I believe that government's main economic duty is to ensure sound money and low taxes. Sound money means controlling inflation, keeping spending under control and getting debt down. So we will rein in private borrowing by correcting that big mistake made by Gordon Brown, and restoring the Bank of England's power to limit debt in the economy. That will help give our economy the financial responsibility it needs. But we need fiscal responsibility too.</p> <p>So we will rein in government borrowing. You know what that means. The country needs to know what that means. And it has a lot clearer idea now, thanks to that fantastic speech by George Osborne on Monday, one of the finest speeches made by any Shadow Chancellor. Sound money means saving in the good years so we can borrow in the bad. It means ending Labour's spendaholic culture it means clamping down on government waste and it means destroying all those useless quangos and initiatives.</p> <p>So I will be asking all my shadow ministers to review all over again every spending programme to see if it is really necessary, really justifiable in these new economic circumstances. But even that will not be enough.</p> <p>The really big savings will come from reforming inefficient public services, and dealing with the long-term social problems that cause government spending to rise. To help us stick to the right course, we'll have an independent Office of Budget Responsibility. There will be no hiding place, no fiddling the figures \u2013 for all governments, forever. It's not experience that will bring about these long-term changes. Experience means you're implicated in the old system that's failed. You can't admit that change is needed, because that would mean admitting you'd got it wrong. We propose a major shake-up in the way the public finances are run and we have the character and the judgment to scrap the discredited fiscal rules and make this vital long-term change.</p> <p><strong>LOW TAXES</strong></p> <p>It's a change that will help us get taxes down. I believe in low taxes \u2013 and today, working people are crying out for relief. Like the young couple I met in York three weeks ago, who both work seven days a week and still struggle to make enough to pay the mortgage.</p> <p>But I am a fiscal conservative. So is George Osborne. We do not believe in tax cuts paid for by reckless borrowing. So let me say this to the call centre worker whose mortgage has gone up by four hundred quid a month but his salary's gone down. To the hairdresser who's a single mum doing another job on the side to try and make ends meet and pay for childcare. To the electrician whose fuel bill, rent bill and food bill have all gone up and he's trying to work out which one to pay when the tax bill's gone up too.</p> <p>I know it's your money. I know you want some of it back. And I want to give it to you. It's one of the reasons I'm doing this job. But we will only cut taxes once it's responsible to do so once we've made government live within its means. The test of whether we're ready for government is not whether we can come up with exciting shadow budgets. It is whether we have the grit and determination to impose discipline on government spending, keep our nerve and say \"no\" - even in the teeth of hostility and protest. That is the responsible party we are and that is the responsible government I will lead.</p> <p><strong>ENTERPRISE</strong></p> <p>Sound money; low taxes. Simple beliefs with profound implications. And here's something else I believe about the economy. I believe that people create jobs, not governments. I understand enterprise. I admire entrepreneurs. I should do \u2013 I go to bed with one every night. And today, Labour's taxes and regulations are making life impossible for our entrepreneurs.</p> <p>Just this week, the exodus of business from Labour's Britain continued as WPP announced it was moving to Ireland. A man called Steven Ellis Cooper emailed me at the end of last month. You know him, this conference heard his story on Sunday. He's from Worcestershire \u2013 and with his wife and two daughters he's been running his business for nearly twenty years. He saw it grow into something he described as \"magical\", employing five people and contributing to the economy. And then along came Labour . Now he's down to his last employee and he says \"I am sat at my desk now in tears as I'm so sad that what I have spent such a long time trying to build up is being so systematically smashed into the floor and the Labour Government are to blame.\" What an outrageous way for a government to treat someone who's trying to do their best, trying to make a living for their family, trying to create opportunity for others. So here's what we're going to do. We'll start by dealing with the nightmare complexity of our business taxes. We'll get rid of those complex reliefs and allowances and use the savings to cut corporation tax by three pence.</p> <p><strong>BEYOND FINANCE</strong></p> <p>But I don't believe that the government's role in the economy is just about tax and spend and sound money and finance. I have never believed in just laissez-faire. I believe the government should play an active part in helping business and industry. So when our economy is overheating in the south east but still needs more investment in the north the right thing to do is not go ahead with a third runway at Heathrow but instead build a new high speed rail network linking Birmingham, Manchester, London, Leeds let's help rebalance Britain's economy.</p> <p>But the problems this country faces go far beyond financial crisis and economic downturn. In the end I want to be judged not just on how well we handle crises, but on two things how we improve the public institution in this country I care about most, the NHS and how we fulfil what will be the long-term mission of the next Conservative government: to repair our broken society.</p> <p><strong>NO TIME FOR MORE STATE CONTROL</strong></p> <p>Now there is a dangerous argument doing the rounds about how we do that. You may have heard it. I have to tell you, Labour are clutching at it as some sort of intellectual lifeline. It goes like this. In these times of difficulty, we need a bigger state. Not just in a financial and economic sense, but in a social sense too. A Labour minister said something really extraordinary last week. It revealed a huge amount about them. David Miliband said that \"unless government is on your side you end up on your own.\" \"On your own\" - without the government. I thought it was one of the most arrogant things I've heard a politician say.</p> <p>For Labour there is only the state and the individual, nothing in between. No family to rely on, no friend to depend on, no community to call on. No neighbourhood to grow in, no faith to share in, no charities to work in. No-one but the Minister, nowhere but Whitehall, no such thing as society - just them, and their laws, and their rules, and their arrogance. You cannot run our country like this.</p> <p>It is why, when we look at what's happening to our country, we can see that the problem is not the leader; it's Labour. They end up treating people like children, with a total lack of trust in people's common sense and decency. This attitude, this whole health and safety, human rights act culture, has infected every part of our life. If you're a police officer you now cannot pursue an armed criminal without first filling out a risk assessment form. Teachers can't put a plaster on a child's grazed knee without calling a first aid officer. Even foreign exchanges for students\u2026you can't host a school exchange any more without parents going through an Enhanced Criminal Record Bureau Check.</p> <p>No, when times are tough, it's not a bigger state we need: it's better, more efficient government. But even more than that we need a stronger society. That means trusting people. And sharing responsibility.</p> <p><strong>NEW POLITICS</strong></p> <p>But no-one will ever take lectures from politicians about responsibility unless we put our own house in order. That means sorting out our broken politics. People are sick of it. Sick of the sleaze, sick of the cynicism. Copper-bottomed pensions. Plasma screen TVs on the taxpayer. Expenses and allowances that wouldn't stand for one second in the private sector.</p> <p>This isn't a Conservative problem, a Labour problem or a Liberal Democrat problem. It is a Westminster problem, and we've all got to sort it out. In the end, this is about the judgment to see how important this issue is for the credibility of politics and politicians. And it's about having the character to take on vested interests inside your own party.</p> <p>That's what I have done. The first to say: MPs voting on their pay, open-ended final salary pension schemes, the John Lewis list \u2013 they have all got to go. And it's no different in Europe. We've drawn up a hard-hitting code of conduct for our MEPs. With European elections next year, the message to them is simple: If you don't sign, you won't stand. And while we're on this subject, there's one other thing that destroys trust in politics. And that's parties putting things in their manifesto and then doing the complete opposite. Next year in those European elections we will campaign with all our energy for that referendum on the European constitution that Labour promised but never delivered. Taking responsibility is how we will mend our broken politics. And sharing responsibility and giving it back to professionals is how we will improve our public services.</p> <p><strong>NHS</strong></p> <p>Let's be straight about what's happened to our NHS. Money has been poured in but maternity wards and A&amp;E departments are closing. Productivity is down. The nurses and doctors are disillusioned, frustrated, angry and demoralised. I know from personal experience just how brilliant and dedicated the people who work in the NHS are. But they have been terribly, terribly let down.</p> <p>Instead of a serious long-term reform plan for the NHS working out how we can deliver a free national health service in an age of rising expectations and rising healthcare costs, never mind the rocketing costs of social care, we've had eleven years of superficial, short-term tinkering. Top-down target after top-down target, with another thirty seven targets added last year. Endless bureaucratic re-organisations, some of them contradictory, others abandoned after just a few months. Labour have taken our most treasured national institution, ripped out its soul and replaced it with targets, directives, management consultants and computers.</p> <p>In August, I got a letter from one of my constituents, John Woods. His wife was taken to hospital. She caught MRSA and she died. Some of the incidents described are so dreadful, and so degrading, that I can't read you most of the letter. He says the treatment his wife received \"was like something out of a 17th century asylum not a 21st century \u00a390 billion health service.\" And then, as his wife's life was coming to end, he remembers her \"sitting on the edge of her bed in distress and saying 'I never thought it would be like this'.\" I sent the letter to Alan Johnson, the Health Secretary.</p> <p>This was his reply.<br>\"A complaints procedure has been established for the NHS to resolve concerns\u2026<br>\"Each hospital and Primary Care Trust has a Patient Advice and Liaison Service to support people who wish to make a complaint\u2026<br>\"There is also an Independent Complaints Advocacy Service\u2026<br>\"If, when Mr Woods has received a response, he remains dissatisfied, it is open to him to approach the Healthcare Commission and seek an independent review of his complaint and local organisation's response\u2026<br>\"Once the Health Care Commission has investigated the case he can approach the Health Service Ombudsman if he remains dissatisfied\u2026.\"</p> <p>A Healthcare Commission. A Health Service Ombudsman. A Patient Advice and Liaison Service. An Independent Complaints Advocacy Service. Four ways to make a complaint but not one way for my constituent's wife to die with dignity. We need to change all that.</p> <p>But here is the plain truth. We will not bring about long-term change if we think that all we have to do is stick with what Labour leave us and just pump some more money in. Instead of those targets and directives that interfere with clinical judgments we'll publish the information about what actually happens in the NHS. We'll give patients an informed choice about where to go for their care so doctors stop answering to Whitehall, and start answering to patients. This way, the health service can at last become exactly that: a service not a take it or leave it bureaucracy. I'm afraid Labour have had their chance to show they can be trusted with the NHS, and they have failed. We are the party of the NHS in Britain today and under my leadership that is how it's going to stay.</p> <p><strong>SOCIAL REFORM</strong></p> <p>But if you want to know what I really hope we will achieve in government. If you want to know where the change will be greatest from what has gone before. It is our plan for social reform. The central task I have set myself and this Party is to be as radical in social reform as Margaret Thatcher was in economic reform. That's how we plan to repair our broken society.</p> <p><strong>BROKEN SOCIETY</strong></p> <p>I know this is a controversial argument. Some say our society isn't broken. I wonder what world they live in. Leave aside that almost two million children are brought up in households where no one works. Or that there are housing estates in Britain where people have a lower life expectancy than in the Gaza Strip. Just consider the senseless, barbaric violence on our streets. Children killing children. Twenty-seven kids murdered on the streets of London this year. A gun crime every hour. A serious knife crime every half hour. A million victims from alcohol related-attacks.</p> <p>But it's not just the crime; not even the anti-social behaviour. It's the angry, harsh culture of incivility that seems to be all around us. When in one generation we seem to have abandoned the habits of all human history that in a civilised society, adults have a proper role - a responsibility - to uphold rules and order in the public realm not just for their own children but for other people's too.</p> <p>Helen Newlove spoke to us yesterday. I can't tell you how much I've been moved by working with Helen over the past year. This woman, whose husband Garry was brutally kicked to death on her own doorstep This woman, who had to explain to her beautiful children that their father was not coming home from the hospital, not ever, because he had dared to be a good, responsible citizen.</p> <p>Helen Newlove knows our society is broken. But she believes we can repair it \u2013 and so do I. The big question is how. And here is where we need some very plain speaking. There are those who say \u2013 and there are many in this hall \u2013 that what is required is tough punishment, longer sentences and more prison places. And to a degree, they're right. We'll never mend the broken society without a clear barrier between right and wrong, and harsh penalties when you cross the line.</p> <p>But let's recognise, once and for all, that such an approach only deals with the symptoms, picking up the pieces of failure that has gone before. Come with me to Wandsworth prison and meet the inmates. Yes you meet the mugger, the robber and the burglar. But you also meet the boy who can't read and never could. The teenager hooked on heroin. The young man who never knew the love of a father. The middle aged failure where no-one in the family has known what it's like to go out and work for two generations or maybe more. Miss the context, miss the cause, miss the background and you'll never get the true picture of why crime is so high in our country.</p> <p>There are those who say that all of this \u2013 mending the broken society - will require state action, state programmes and state money. And to a degree, they are right too. We are not an anti-state party. In the twentieth century, state-run social programmes had real success in fighting poverty and making our society stronger. Pensions, sickness benefits, state education: I honour those men and women of all parties and none who created these safety nets and springboards. But today, the returns from endless big state intervention are not just diminishing, they are disappearing. That's because too often, state intervention deals with the symptoms of the problem. I want us to be different: to deal with the long-term causes. That will be the test of our character and judgment.</p> <p><strong>FAMILIES</strong></p> <p>First, families. If we sincerely care about children's futures, then all families, however organised, need our help and support. So I don't have some idealised, rose-tinted view of the family. I know families can be imperfect. I get the modern world.</p> <p>But I think that in our modern world, in these times of stress and anxiety the family is the best welfare system there is. That's why I want to scrap Labour's plans for a new army of untrained outreach workers so we can have over 4,000 extra health visitors and guarantees of family visits before and after your child is born. To those who say this is some sort of nanny state I say: nonsense.</p> <p>Remember what it was like the first few nights after your first child is born, the worry, the uncertainly, the questions. Health visitors are a lifeline \u2013 and I want more of them. It's because I want to strengthen families that I support flexible working. To those who say this is some intolerable burden on business, I say \"wrong\". Business pays the costs of family breakdown in taxes \u2013 and isn't it right that everyone, including business, should play their part in making Britain a more family-friendly country? Do you know what, if we don't change these antiquated business practices then women half the talent of the country are just put off from joining the workforce.</p> <p>We will also back marriage in the tax system. To those who say\u2026why pick out marriage why do you persist in aggravating people who for whatever reason choose not to get married I say I don't want to aggravate anyone, but I believe in commitment and many of us, me included, will always remember that moment when you say, up there in front of others, it's not just me anymore, it's us, together, and that helps to take you through the tough times and that's something we should cherish as a society.</p> <p><strong>SCHOOLS</strong></p> <p>When families fail, school is the way we can give children a second chance. My passion about this is both political and personal. After the 2005 election, shadow education secretary was the job I asked for in the Shadow Cabinet and Michael Howard kindly let me have it. I'm not sure my reshuffles work quite like that, but there we are. He's a very kind man and was a great leader of our party. But it's personal because I'm the father of three young children \u2013 and I worry about finding good schools for them more than anything else.</p> <p>There's nothing quite like that feeling when you watch your children wandering across the playground, school bag in one hand, packed lunch in the other, knowing they're safe, they're happy, they've got a great teacher in a good school. But the straightforward truth is that there aren't enough good schools, particularly secondary schools, particularly in some of our bigger towns and cities. Any government I lead will not go on excusing this failure. That's why Michael Gove has such radical plans to establish 1,000 New Academies, with real freedoms, like grant maintained schools used to have. And that's why, together, we will break open the state monopoly and allow new schools to be set up. And to those who say we cannot wait for structural reform and competition to raise standards I say - yes, you're right, and we will not wait.</p> <p>The election of a Conservative government will bring \u2013 and I mean this almost literally - a declaration of war against those parts of the educational establishment who still cling to the cruelty of the \"all must win prizes\" philosophy and the dangerous practice of dumbing down.</p> <p>Listen to this. It's the President of the Spelling Society. He said, and I quote, \"people should be able to use whichever spelling they prefer.\" He's the President of the Spelling Society. Well, he's wrong. And by the way, that's spelt with a 'W.'</p> <p>And then there's the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority. These are the people who are officially supposed to maintain standards in our school system. You pay their wages. And do you know what you get in return? They let a child get marks for writing \"F off\" as an answer in an exam. As Prime Minister I'd have my own two words for people like that, and yes, one of them does begin with an 'F'. You're fired.</p> <p><strong>WELFARE</strong></p> <p>If strengthening families is the first line of defence against social breakdown, and school reform is the second \u2013 then welfare reform is the full, pitched battle. This problem goes very deep \u2013 and dealing with it will be very tough. There are almost five million people in Britain of working age who are out of work and on benefits. That's bad for them. It's bad for our society. And it's bad for our economy. Decades ago, when we had a universal collective culture of respect for work, a system of unconditional benefits was good and right and effective. But if we're going to talk straight we've got to admit something.</p> <p>That culture doesn't exist any more. In fact, worse than that, the benefit system itself encourages a benefit culture, and sends some pretty perverse messages. It's not even that it's picking up the pieces and treating the symptoms, rather than providing a cure. Today, it is actively making the problem worse.</p> <p>So we will end the something for nothing culture. If you don't take a reasonable offer of a job, you lose benefits. Go on doing it, you'll keep losing benefits. Stay on benefits and you'll have to work for them. I spent some time recently sitting with a benefit officer in a Job Centre plus. In came a young couple. She was pregnant. He was the dad. They were out of work and trying to get somewhere to live. The benefit officer didn't really have much choice but to explain that they would be better off if she lived on her own. What on earth are we doing with a system like that? With the money we save by ending the something for nothing welfare culture we will say to that couple in that benefit office: Stay together, bring up your kid, build your family, we're on your side and we will end that couple penalty.</p> <p><strong>PROGRESSIVE ENDS, CONSERVATIVE MEANS</strong></p> <p>In all these ways, and with the inspiring help of Iain Duncan Smith, we have made the modern Conservative Party the party of social justice. The party that says yes: we can build a society where anyone can rise from the bottom to the top with nothing in their way but only if we put in place radical Conservative school reform to do it.</p> <p>Yes: we can build a society where we end the scandal of child poverty and give every child the decent start they deserve but only if we have radical Conservative welfare reform to achieve it. This is the big argument in British politics today, an argument through which we show that in this century as we have shown in the centuries that went before with Peel, with Shaftesbury, with Disraeli, when the call comes for a politics of dignity and aspiration for the poor and the marginalised, for the people whom David Davis so vividly described as the victims of state failure, when the call comes to expand hope and broaden horizons it is this Party, the Conservative Party it is our means, Conservative means that will achieve those great and noble progressive ends of fighting poverty, extending opportunity, and repairing our broken society.</p> <p><strong>READY FOR CHANGE</strong></p> <p>Progressive ends; Conservative means. That is a big argument about the future. That is a big change. And it is because we had the courage to change that we are able to make it. We changed because knew we had to make ourselves relevant to the twenty-first century. You didn't pick more women candidates to try and look good you did it so we wouldn't lock out talent and fail to come up with the policies that modern families need. You didn't champion green politics as greenwash but because climate change is devastating our environment because the energy gap is a real and growing threat to our security and because $100-a-barrel oil is hitting families every time they fill up their car and pay their heating bills.</p> <p>You didn't take international development seriously because it was fashionable but because it is a true reflection of the country we live in, a Britain that is outward-looking, internationalist and generous and because this Party that has always believed in one nation must in this century be a Party of one world. This is who we are today and those who say the Tories haven't changed totally underestimate the capacity this Party has always had to pick itself up, turn itself around and make itself relevant to the challenges of the hour. Those who say we haven't changed just show how little they have changed.</p> <p><strong>A UNITED PARTY</strong></p> <p>We are a changed party and we are a united party. We are making progress in the north in the south in the east and in the west. The first Conservative by-election gain from Labour in thirty years. The first Conservative metropolitan council in the North East in thirty four years. And the first Conservative Mayor of London, Boris Johnson. We are a united party, united in spirit and united in purpose. And we know that our task is to take people with us. Rebuilding our battered economy. Renewing our bureaucratised NHS. Repairing our broken society. That is our plan for change. But in these difficult times we promise no new dawns, no overnight transformations. I'm a man with a plan, not a miracle cure.</p> <p><strong>A UNITED COUNTRY</strong></p> <p>These difficult times need leadership, yes. They need character and judgment. The leadership to unite your party and build a strong team. The character to stick to your guns and not bottle it when times get tough. The judgment to understand the mistakes that have been made and to offer the country change. Leadership, character, judgment. That's what Britain needs at a time like this and that's what this party now offers.</p> <p>I know we are living in difficult times but I am still optimistic because I have faith in human nature in our remarkable capacity to innovate, to experiment, to overcome obstacles and to find a way through difficulties whether those problems are created by man or nature.</p> <p>We can and will come through. We always do. Not because of our government. But because of the people of Britain. Because of what you do \u2013 because of the work you do, the families you raise, the jobs you create because of your attitude, your confidence and your determination. So because we are united\u2026 Because we have had the courage to change. Because we have the fresh answers to the challenges of our age.</p> <p>I believe we now have the opportunity, and more than that the responsibility, to bring our country together. Together in the face of this financial crisis. Together in determination that we will come through it. Together in the hope, the belief that better times will lie ahead.</p>",
  "<p>We've long been predicting a recession but today brought the concrete figures to suggest that the economy shrank in the quarter just ending.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2008/oct/01/manufacturing.manufacturingdata\">latest monthly snapshot of the manufacturing sector</a> from the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply made for grim reading. Its index reading for the overall health of the sector slumped to its lowest since the survey began in 1992 - the middle of the last recession - and was hugely below what City pundits had been expecting.</p> <p>The CIPS survey has a good record as an early indicator of trends in the sector and so its report suggests <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/manufacturing\">that the few manufacturing firms left in Britain</a> (they now only account for about 14% of the economy) are struggling to remain afloat.</p> <p>The hope has been that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/currencies\">the fall in the pound's value this year</a> would help boost firms' ability to compete in overseas markets. Unfortunately, those markets are now slumping like ours, so there is no respite there. </p> <p>In fact, the CIPS survey showed export orders at their weakest since September 2001. And other similar surveys from other countries today showed manufacturing across the world's leading economies is contracting.</p> <p><strong>Services take a hit too</strong></p> <p>So what? you say, manufacturing doesn't matter any more and services account for the bulk of the economy.</p> <p>True, to some extent, but the other, less noticed data out today from the Office for National Statistics showed that output growth in the services sector - which accounts for about 70% of the economy - ground to a halt in the three months to July. It had expanded by 0.2% in the second quarter of the year. The new figure is the worst for six years.</p> <p>So the main part of the economy has ceased to grow and manufacturing is shrinking. The base we are starting from is that official data confirmed on Tuesday that the economy had not grown at all. </p> <p>All that was before the events of September and before the mortgage market seized completely - August saw total lending down 95% from July. </p> <p>The economy simply must have contracted in the quarter just ended, although we won't get the initial estimate of growth from the ONS for another month. </p> <p>Growth has been slowing by 0.2 to 0.3 percentage points a quarter for the past three quarters to the end of June. Economists now think that the third quarter will see a contraction of 0.1% or 0.2%, the first actual drop since the early 1990s recession.</p> <p>Given that the fourth quarter must be a write-off after the events of the past three weeks, and you have met the definition of a \"technical\" recession. Given, too, that many economists expect the economy as a whole to contract through the whole of 2009 and you have a recession by any definition.</p> <p>Time then, for a round of interest rate cuts to cushion the blow. A rate cut must come next week or the Bank of England will have plenty to answer for.</p>",
  "<p>The company at the heart of the tainted milk powder scandal asked officials to help conceal the extent of the problem, the state media said today.</p> <p>Tens of thousands of babies have been taken ill and four have died due to kidney problems after drinking Sanlu infant formula containing melamine, a chemical which should not be used in food. The issue has caused public outrage and raised further questions about product safety in China.</p> <p>Lower levels of the substance have since been found in dairy goods from other companies and foodstuffs made with milk powder. Firms around the world have been forced to withdraw products due to health concerns.</p> <p>The authorities had already said that officials in Shijiazhuang, Hebei, where Sanlu is based, sat on a report from the company for more than a month before telling provincial bosses. Beijing fired several as a result.</p> <p>But in today's People's Daily - the Communist party mouthpiece - Shijiazhuang government spokesman Wang Jianguo said Sanlu asked for help in \"managing\" the media response to the case when it informed authorities of the problem on August 2. Parents had begun complaining to the firm by the end of 2007.</p> <p>According to the paper, Sanlu's letter asked the government to \"increase control and coordination of the media, to create a good environment for the recall of the company's problem products. This is to avoid whipping up the issue and creating a negative influence in society.\"</p> <p>Wang said his colleagues did send a team to investigate Sanlu as soon as they became aware of the issue.</p> <p>But the People's Daily pointed out that they did not inform the provincial government until September 9.</p> <p>Wang expressed \"deep guilt and pain\" for the scandal, adding: \"We mistakenly thought that taking necessary measures and raising product quality could mitigate the effect and reduce losses.</p> <p>\"The bungling of the best opportunity to report up the handling of the issue caused much harm to people's safety, and seriously affected the image of the party and the government.\"</p> <p>China Daily today quoted Sun Zhengcai, minister of agriculture, as pledging to bring China's milk collection stations under a single supervision system. That should help to address concerns that safety checks are failing because of the complexity of the current system.</p> <p>Jorgen Schlundt, director of food safety at the World Health Organisation, told a press conference in Beijing last week: \"A problem many countries have had is a split in responsibilities between too many different authorities. Clearly it was also a problem here. Fourteen to 16 authorities were involved in the chain, which results in a system which is not optimal.\"</p> <p>The Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection, and Quarantine said yesterday that 13% of 154 milk and formula producers tested in a second round of checks had melamine in their products. Most of the products containing melamine were still related to Sanlu and subsidiaries, it added.</p> <p>Zhou Bohua, minister of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, said the dairy industry and authorities had recalled 8,256 tons of milk powder and liquid milk as of Tuesday.</p> <p>Yesterday Unilever recalled Lipton-brand milk tea powder in Hong Kong and Macau after traces of melamine were detected in batches - becoming the latest international food group to be hit by concerns about the issue. It described the move as a precautionary measure and said no other Lipton milk tea powder products were affected.</p> <p>The WHO has said that food can acquire traces of melamine from the environment or its packaging without posing a risk to health.</p>",
  "<p>\"We went to a firin' range,\" recalls Curtis Jackson, aka 50 Cent. \"Robert [de Niro] was researchin' what he was gonna do as a New York City police officer, so he was around New York City police, shootin' in their firin' range. Al [Pacino] came along towards the end.\"</p> <p>Picture the scene: you're a hard-working New York beat cop, just off a shift, ready to put in some extra hours honing your weapons skills. But when you get down to the range, in the lanes either side of you, hammering round after round into silhouette targets, are Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and the former crack dealer-turned-gangsta rapper and actor 50 Cent. Talk about life imitating art. \"Heh heh heh!\" he chuckles. \"Yeah, it was crazy.\"</p> <p>Is he a good shot? \"I'm good. They'll tell you,\" the 33-year-old grins, nodding at De Niro and Pacino's photos on a publicity poster for the film Righteous Kill, in which he stars alongside them. \"I hit all kinds o' things - those little targets, people...\" And he smiles again, the gurgling beginnings of another chortle wheezing up from his chest.</p> <p>Jackson may be noted for many things, but his sense of humour isn't one of them. Orphaned at the age of eight when his mother was murdered, he was shot nine times and left for dead at the age of 25. Yet in the summer of 2002, the first LP he released after signing a million-dollar deal with the biggest names in hip-hop - Eminem and Dr Dre - became the fastest-selling debut in American chart history. He effected this incredible transformation by turning art into science - by methodically and meticulously planning his music, and leaving nothing to chance. It has made him a star, but a curiously two-dimensional one: his music never gets close to revealing the ready-to-laugh, easygoing, affable yet conflicted personality he brings to conversation.</p> <p>It's tempting to see acting as being easy for him: certainly, he seems to spend most of his time in public putting on a 50 Cent show. Screen work had not been on his agenda - he was approached to, in effect, play himself in the thinly disguised autobiography Get Rich and Die Tryin' (2005) - but if the calibre of his collaborators is any gauge, it has been a steep learning curve. Get Rich... was directed by Jim Sheridan (who directed Daniel Day-Lews in My Left Foot and In the Name of the Father) and one of 50's co-stars was the Oscar-nominated Terrence Howard. Righteous Kill is only his third movie, yet he's sharing screen time with two icons of cinema. Was he under any pressure?</p> <p>\"The opportunity to work with both of 'em was amazing,\" he agrees, \"but I felt I wasn't the only one that was there nervous! The entire cast was. For them, maybe, it's just another project. But for me it's somethin' more: it's exciting to be a part of it. Whether I do another film project or not - and I already completed another one, it'll be out in March [the Louisiana-set Streets of Blood, with Val Kilmer and Sharon Stone] - I'm cool: I got the chance to work with the best.\"</p> <p>Jackson was strong in Get Rich... though was essentially recalling events that had more or less actually happened; and the Righteous Kill roe of Spider, a New York drug dealer, is hardly one he has to spend months researching. The jury is still out on his acting, and he did not prove a big enough silver screen draw to prevent his second film, the Iraq war drama Home of the Brave, in which he starred alongside Samuel L Jackson, Cristina Ricci and Jessica Biel, from tanking at the box office.</p> <p>Music and movies are now just two facets of the 50 Cent brand. He made a reputed $100 million after a mineral water company, in which he had accepted shares as payment for an endorsement, was sold to Coca Cola. And as well as the de rigueur rap star accoutrements (record label, trainer range, streetwear lines, video game), he has even been in negotiations with a South African billionaire to invest in a platinum mine.</p> <p>Jackson's music is just as driven as his business dealings. The chiselled torso on his album sleeves seems an apt visual metaphor for the records' contents: they are the result of hours of hard, repetitive work, honed and toned to perfection, but with seemingly little fun involved in getting to the end result. But that's not how he sees it.</p> <p>\"Conceptually, I don't think people understand the process of what I'm doin' to create the records,\" he muses. \"They just see it as, 'OK, a new song'. But if you listen to the actual records, I'm paintin' pictures, of scenarios an' situations I've seen first-hand. This is where my inspiration comes from: at some point it reflects somethin' that I was actually surrounded by or forced to be around. And the negative things, or bad things, that you experience stick out in your mind a lot more than the positive things. The Curtis album [his most recent, and, at around 4 million worldwide sales, the least successful of his three solo LPs] was supposed to be human, in my head. The laughter at the beginnin' of Straight to the Bank was a symbol of the joy.\"</p> <p>You have to go back to before Jackson was shot to find a song in which he told jokes. How to Rob, possibly the best and certainly the most relaxed thing he's ever done, has 50 running through a lengthy list of rap and R&amp;B stars, musing in spry, pointed couplets on what he might get away with if he stuck them up. The 1999 song sounds like it was recorded while the humour was still fresh, knocked out quickly. \"Right,\" he nods. \"Very quick. It was made out of desperation.\"</p> <p>His girlfriend's pregnancy had provided the short sharp shock that sentences to rehabilitation programmes and an army-style boot camp had failed to deliver; Jackson had decided to abandon his lucrative crack dealing enterprise and, after meeting the Run DMC DJ Jam Master Jay, who encouraged him to write raps and schooled him in song structure, he decided that his future lay in music. He was signed to the major label Columbia, and was working on an album - but his career progress seemed to have stalled, and How to Rob was his attempt to get it moving again.</p> <p>\"Columbia didn't understand who I was as an artist, didn't know how to market me to the public,\" he says. \"The concept of How to Rob wasn't difficult. I knew all the details, I had frivolous information that fit into the song about different artists, without even thinkin' about it. So writing it was easy enough for it just to be fun.\"</p> <p>It worked, earning the newcomer a place on a film soundtrack album, and creating a buzz. But then came the shooting. The circumstances surrounding the attempt on his life remain unclear - the prime suspect was himself murdered weeks later, and while the case has been invoked in other court testimony, no charges were ever brought. If Jackson knows who was responsible, he has never said. To him, the worst was yet to come: as if nearly losing his life wasn't enough, he also lost his job.</p> <p>\"When I was shot Columbia Records stopped communicatin' with me, like I shot somebody,\" he recalls. \"Suddenly, not knowin' what you're gonna do with your life after you've made the decision to write music for a living, everything is more confusing. In that space where you're actually experiencing it, you can get angry an' say, 'I shoulda just been doin' the shooting, 'cos then at least I wouldn'ta had to go through the painful portion of bein' shot.' Some people'll hear that and be like, 'I can't believe he just said that.' But it's because they're not from that environment, they haven't been in those positions and that space.\"</p> <p>The combination of extremes certainly served to harden Jackson's resolve, and when he recovered, he attacked his hip-hop career with the unremitting determination that is a trademark of his albums. Not that 50 reckons his experiences make him a hard man.</p> <p>\"I went to perform for the soldiers in Iraq,\" he recalls. \"<em>Those</em> are the tough guys - the ones who signed up for it. Psychologically, the people that I met aren't even the same people that their loved ones miss at home. Could you imagine how different you'd be if you came in a platoon of 45 people, an' now your platoon is 27, an' then tomorrow it's 21, then 18? They go for different reasons, and the sad part is that some of 'em went for a college education and in exchange they're gonna go to war probably not gonna make it back. They don't say 'Sign up to die for your country,' because the lines'd be a lot smaller. But to kill is different - an opportunity to kill without punishment is what they sign up for.\"</p> <p>Does he really believe that? \"Yeah. If you're goin' to war, what would your expectations be?\"</p> <p>That you might have to kill, but not that you'd necessarily want to. You'd maybe hope that your presence might defuse situations; feel that your job was to keep the peace, not wage war.</p> <p>\"Alright,\" he allows. \"But I think, generally, the guys just decidin' to sign up now? They would be excited about the opportunity to go, especially after bein' attacked. After 9/11, they're gonna sign up to go kill.\"</p> <p>It is a revealing claim. On the one hand, here is an artist who projects a steely invulnerability, erecting impenetrable barriers that prevent his listeners from getting close to an understanding; who has refined his mindset to seemingly eradicate anything other than forward-looking focus, surely in part as a form of emotional self-defence. Yet on the other, here he is, throwing thoughts around in conversation with a stranger which shine light into corners of his psyche that all that hard work and resolve has been built up to hide.</p> <p>\"People don't understand,\" he says. \"In order to be as successful as I've been in the last five years, I can't possibly be what the message is in the music. It's art.\" But maybe it would be more powerful art if 50 Cent could allow himself a little less meticulousness in his method; let himself off his own tight leash, and let his listeners in a bit more.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>50 Cent's new album, Before I Self-Destruct, is due out in December</em></p>",
  "<p>It was all our fault, apparently. It wasn't the most auspicious start to <a href=\"http://www.kingsplace.co.uk/\">the Kings Place era</a> and today's opening events in London's new concert halls. <a href=\"http://www.kingsplace.co.uk/music/opening-festival\">For most of the first programme this morning</a> - an enterprising lineup of Simon Holt, Jo Kondo, Niccolo Castiglioni and Bela Bartok \u2013 the musicians of the Endymion Ensemble had to compete with a percussive counterpoint of offstage hammering. This aleatoric intervention destroyed the delicate soundworld of Kondo's Birthday Hocket and threatened to derail oboist Melinda Maxwell's world premiere performance of Simon Holt's Disparate. A rival chamber music hall trying to sabotage the opening gig? A gesture of anti-classical music protest? Unfortunately nothing so dramatic: instead, it was workmen fitting out the Guardian's offices - we're moving in soon, completing Kings Place's grand fusion of the corporate and the cultural.</p> <p>At least by the time of Bartok's Contrasts the workmen had been silenced, but there was an air of genial chaos even before the first concert kicked off at half past nine this morning. In the middle of the public atrium outside the hall, Stephen Stirling played a fanfare for solo horn by Martin Butler, but he had to fight against the noise of 100 metronomes - an automated performance of Ligeti's Po\u00e8me Symphonique - as well as the hall's excited announcer. Still, it's a symbol of the adventure and enterprise of Kings Place that its first-ever public <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/classicalmusicandopera\">music-making</a> should be of Ligeti's mechanical masterpiece.</p> <p>And none of these teething troubles could detract from the dazzling acoustics of the 420-seat Hall 1. It's a space that combines clarity and intimacy. Maxwell's assured performance of Holt's Disparate was a virtuosic way to consecrate the hall, with everything from piercing, high-register intensity to inchoate multiphonics. Holt himself said that \"despite the marteau sans ma\u00eetre [the hammer without a master], it was a superb performance\". Nothing escapes this acoustic, and you could hear every detail of attack, every in-breath and every bow-hair on the string in Bartok's Contrasts. It must be an unforgiving place to play: there is no comfort zone in this hall for anything less than absolute accuracy.</p> <p>Kings Place also sounds completely different from <a href=\"http://www.wigmore-hall.org.uk/\">the Wigmore Hall</a>. Based on Endymion's first two concerts - I also heard them in Ligeti's Horn Trio and Thomas Dunhill's Quintet - Kings Place has a clearer, more analytical sound, and the Wigmore Hall is richer, warmer, more romantic. For my money, Hall 1 sounds better the further back you sit, and can sound constricted in romantic repertoires - Dunhill's pseudo-Brahmsian part-writing did not bloom like it would have done in the Wigmore, but Ligeti's lamenting lines and micro-tonal melodies were served beautifully by the space. However, any final judgments will need more time: after all, they're only just warming up. There are still over 90 concerts to go in their opening, five-day festival, and there's another hall to sample, with its more eclectic programme of jazz and world music. There's even baroque opera to look forward to later today in Hall 1.</p> <p>My hunch is that Peter Millican and his architect, Jeremy Dixon, have conquered their first challenge. Kings Place is a space that performers will want to play, and audiences will want to visit, with its combination of world-class acoustics, free art galleries - and great bacon sandwiches. But the real proof of the Kings Place pudding will come in the future: can Peter really sustain his privately financed funding model? One lesson from history suggests it could be difficult: <a href=\"http://www.barbican.org.uk/\">when the Barbican Centre</a> opened its doors in 1982, the idea was that their programmes of conferences and catering would fund the artistic programme. Alas, it didn't last long before the Corporation of London had to get seriously involved in subsidy. Without the equivalent of a Corporation-style safety-net in Kings Place, I hope that Millican's model can succeed where the Barbican's failed.</p>",

When <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ9hUApU3-0\">asked</a> in Friday's presidential debate to identify the lessons of Iraq, he reminded voters that he missed the lessons of Vietnam. \"I think the lessons of Iraq are very clear that you cannot have a failed strategy that will then cause you to nearly lose a conflict,\" he said.</p> <p>McCain still believes that in Iraq and Vietnam the problem was the wrong strategy, not the wrong war. It may be the last thing in this campaign McCain says that's true to his core beliefs and record, but he's wrong. Dead wrong. </p> <p>As Jeffrey Goldberg reports in his <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200810/mccain\">cover story</a> in the October issue of the Atlantic, McCain believes that Vietnam was winnable, and that politicians lost that war because they didn't let the military do its job. If only they would have let him and his fellow Navy flyers bomb North Vietnam back to the Stone Age, the US could have prevailed.</p> <p>Colin Powell, who served two terms in Vietnam as mid-level officer, admits he too was troubled by his Vietnam experience. That led him to formulate the <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/extra/teachers/lessonplans/iraq/powelldoctrine.html\">Powell Doctrine</a>, eight questions to be answered before the US takes military action. The Iraq invasion failed at least six of the eight tests, including \"Is a vital US security interest threatened?\" and \"Have the consequences of our action been fully considered?\" After opposing an attack on Iraq from the dawn of the Bush administration, Powell got dragged along out of the loyalty to the president, but sees his support for the war as <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/2020/Politics/story?id=1105979&amp;page=1\">\"a blot\"</a> on his record. <br> In contrast, McCain was a cheerleader for the Iraq invasion, remains proud of it and hasn't learned a thing that will help him make the right decision when the next war of choice comes along. \"There is no such thing as containment,\" he tells Goldberg, underscoring the frightening doctrine of pre-emptive war while confirming his aversion to reflection and his Vietnam obsession.</p> <p>McCain doesn't understand lesson number one of Vietnam: you can't win a political war with foreign military troops. Whatever the war in Iraq began as, it's a political war now. The presence of US troops <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/sep/23/usforeignpolicy.iraq\">undermines</a> the legitimacy and appeal of the Iraqi government that needs to win hearts and minds to stop the violence and build credibility. </p> <p>McCain claims that his troop surge strategy was successful, yet he denies the one metric that would indicate success. The surge was intended to provide a lull in violence that would enable Iraqis to get their political house in order. It may have been na\u00efve to think they could do it in a few months after four years of dithering. The great irony is that Iraqis now say they're ready to stand on their own and want the US to leave, precisely the goal of the surge. But McCain and US military brass say the Iraqis aren't ready. The Bush administration has agreed to a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/22/world/middleeast/22baghdad.html?ref=middleeast\">2011 deadline for withdrawal</a>, but McCain can't even reconcile himself to that distant date. In the debate, he pretended that there is no timetable, no effective Iraqi government, and that Americans alone will determine when, if ever, they leave Iraq. </p> <p>McCain tried to tie the war in Iraq to the fighting in Afghanistan and to Bush's global war on terrorism. Vietnam taught the lesson that not every conflict fits into the global struggle of the moment. In the 1960s, the US was deep in its cold war against the Soviet Union. The North Vietnamese government called itself communist, but fighting in Vietnam did the US more harm than good in its struggle with the Soviets, costing the US status and goodwill around the world. Developing countries rejected US aid programmes such as the Peace Corps over Vietnam, and US allies had to moderate their support in the face of strong domestic antiwar sentiment. Similarly, the US invasion of Iraq has made it harder for those who share US values, including moderates in the Muslim world, to stand up to radicals. The Iraq fiasco has given solid evidence to <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/us-war-terror-has-not/story.aspx?guid=%7BB932D5F5-5034-4246-85E4-3B30BA5487E2%7D&amp;dist=hppr\">support</a> the worst accusations of America's enemies. </p> <p>Republicans also persist with their myth that fighting in Iraq helps keep the US homeland safe. This is moronic. The invasion created new enemies for the US, and every day that the US stays in Iraq is one more day terrorist recruiters can say the US occupies a Muslim country that it invaded without justification. But that's not the worst of it. </p> <p>As Barack Obama pointed out during the debate, in the midst of the Wall Street crisis, the US is still spending $10bn a month in Iraq. Vietnam demonstrated that the US couldn't have guns and butter without consequences. President Lyndon Johnson tried to press ahead with his Great Society agenda while escalating in Vietnam. He wound up resurrecting the deadly beast of inflation and saw his other war, the war on poverty, mired in the swamps of the Mekong Delta.</p> <p>Vietnam also demonstrated that even wars in faraway places that don't directly threaten the US carry grave risks at home. Because of the military draft and far larger number of US troops involved, Vietnam polarised the country. That hasn't happened over Iraq, at least not yet. Republicans like to scream class warfare whenever anyone questions the innate wisdom of tax cuts for rich. But the US risks real class warfare waging the Iraq war with a volunteer force comprised largely of poor people and compels re-enlistments through obscure contract clauses, while troops' parents lose their homes and pay more taxes so the government can rescue big banks and politicians' egos.</p> <p>It's understandable that McCain missed the lessons of Vietnam at home because, as he said during a Republican primary debate in response to a question about skipping Woodstock: <a href=\"http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2007/10/24/429147.aspx\">\"I was tied up.\"</a> McCain can be excused for not understanding what he didn't live through. But he remains haunted by what he did live through. \"A war that I was in, where we had an army, that it wasn't through any fault of their own, but they were defeated,\" he said at Friday's debate. \"And I know how hard it is for an army and a military to recover from that. And it did, and we will win this one, and we won't come home in defeat and dishonour and probably have to go back if we fail.\"</p> <p>McCain is trying to win in Iraq to wipe away that defeat. It's to his credit that Lieutenant Commander McCain was willing to put life on the line to win in Vietnam. But there's nothing honourable about senator or President McCain committing unlimited numbers of other lives to defeat Ho Chi Minh now on whatever battlefield he can find. </p> <p>What McCain should have learned from his Vietnam experience, as Colin Powell did, is that the US needs to choose its fights carefully. Even miles offshore and hundreds of metres in the air, there's no safe or easy war. Yet, last month, McCain was seemingly spoiling for a fight with the Russians over Georgia, even though a third combat front for the US military would be a nightmare scenario. In the past, he's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-zoPgv_nYg\">sung about bombing Iran</a> as if it's a laughing matter. When George Bush blustered <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2003-07-02-bush-iraq-troops_x.htm\">\"Bring it on\"</a>, he just didn't know better. McCain has no excuse.</p> <p>McCain and his supporters are right that it's now pointless to debate the wisdom of invading Iraq, just as it's pointless to debate sending 535,000 US troops to Vietnam. History has judged McCain wrong on both fronts. Voters need to ask which presidential candidate has learned history's lessons to avoid the next mistake. With Hanoi's Red River dykes still in his bomb sights, McCain is ready to grasp with both hands, not the lessons of the Vietnam, but the next tar baby our dangerous times produce. Rather than slay his Vietnam demons, McCain appears destined for the fate of those who don't learn from history.</p>",
  "<p>Middle Eastern countries should set up a new regional organisation that includes all Arab states as well as Israel, Iran, and Turkey, the pro-western Gulf state of Bahrain has urged.</p> <p>The highly unusual call \u2014 which is likely to provoke controversy \u2014 came from Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmed al-Khalifa, the country's foreign minister.</p> <p>\"Why don't we all sit together even if we have differences and even if we don't recognise each other?\" he told the London-based daily newspaper al-Hayat. \"Why not become one organisation? </p> <p>\"Aren't we all members of a global organisation called the United Nations? Why not [come together] on a regional basis? This is the only way to solve our problems. There's no other way to solve them, now or in 200 years.\"</p> <p>Asked if that should include Israel, he replied: \"With Israel, Turkey, Iran and Arab countries. Let them all sit together in one group.\"</p> <p>This was clearly more than a throwaway remark. The day before the al-Hayat interview, Sheikh Khalid made the same point in a speech to the UN general assembly in New York, calling for such a body to include countries \"without exception\".</p> <p>Bahrain is a close ally of the US \u2014 and home to a key naval base \u2014 and like nearby Qatar has discreet, informal links with Israel. Of the 21 members of the Arab League, only Egypt, Jordan and faraway Mauritania have full diplomatic ties with the Jewish state. Other Arab countries have always refused to establish relations with Israel until it signs peace agreements with the Palestinians and Syria.</p> <p>All have resisted any sort of \"normalisation\" in relations, seeing that as a concession that can only be made when a comprehensive peace has been reached in the region. But all support the 2002 Arab peace initiative, which called for peace with Israel if it withdraws to the 1967 borders.</p> <p>Iran, which backs Hizbullah in Lebanon and Hamas in the Palestinian territories, is extremely hostile to Israel and highly unlikely to join a regional bloc with it. Syria is Iran's only Arab ally. But other Arab states, especially the powerful Saudis, fear Tehran's regional influence and nuclear ambitions and blame it for rising Sunni-Shia sectarianism.</p> <p>Sheikh Khalid said Arab countries should also play a role in talks between the US and Iran. \"We are in Iran's backyard. If we don't know what is going on, how can we put our proposals on the table?\"</p> <p>Bahrain's relations with Iran, a powerful presence across the Gulf, are influenced by the fact that its ruling al-Khalifa dynasty is Sunni and rules over a restive Shia majority.</p> <p>Earlier this year Bahrain appointed a Jewish woman as its ambassador to the US \u2014 a first in the Arab world. On a recent visit to London, King Hamad met members of the country's Jewish community living in the UK.</p>",
  "<p>Fears that Britain is moving into recession grew today as the latest gloomy economic data piled pressure on the Bank of England to cut <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/interestrates\">interest rates</a> next week.</p> <p>In a further sign that manufacturers are struggling, Ford was gearing up to introduce a four-day week at a UK factory, although employees will stay on full pay.</p> <p>The company said the production line at its Transit van plant in Southampton would fall silent on Mondays, and that 125 temporary workers would not be kept on at the site.</p> <p>It blamed the \"tough\" economic climate for the move, which will see output fall from 74,000 vehicles in 2007 to below 70,000 this year.</p> <p>British manufacturing is now shrinking at the fastest rate since records began nearly 17 years ago, figures released today showed. </p> <p>The service sector has ground to a halt, hardening expectations that Britain is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/recession\">entering its first recession since the early 1990s</a>. </p> <p>Levels of output, new orders and employment in the manufacturing sector recorded unprecedented declines last month while price pressures eased, according to the latest survey from the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply/Markit. </p> <p>The CIPS purchasing managers' index fell to 41 - the lowest level since the series began in January 1992 - from a downwardly revised 45.3 in August. Any reading below 50 indicates contraction.</p> <p>\"Very grim indeed,\" Alan Clarke, at BNP Paribas, said. \"Manufacturing is clearly overshadowed by the services sector. </p> <p>\"Hence if we do see a repeat of today's dive in the services sector CIPS on Friday - and there is no reason why we shouldn't given the recent financial sector turmoil - then these surveys are going to be screaming recession and screaming for an imminent rate cut.\"</p> <p>Official figures showed service sector output - which makes up three-quarters of the economy - was flat in the three months to July, with hotels and restaurants recording the biggest fall at 1.5%. The only category to grow was business services and finance.</p> <p>Economists said today's data suggests the economy contracted in the third quarter, following zero growth in the second.</p> <p>\"Overall, these figures bring the UK economy much closer to recession,\" Paul Dales, at Capital Economics, said, predicting that GDP would shrink 0.2% next year. </p> <p>Manufacturing has now contracted for five months in a row. </p> <p>Firms reported that the credit crunch and the slump in the housing and construction sectors were prompting clients to cancel or postpone orders, leading to the sharpest fall in domestic new orders on record last month. </p> <p>The index plummeted to 36.1 from 41.9, with new orders from abroad falling at their fastest rate in seven years, confounding expectations that the weaker pound would help exporters.</p> <p>The output index slumped to a record low of 41.2 from 47.6. Manufacturers laid off workers at the fastest rate since the survey began, with the employment index dropping to 40.1 from 43.5.</p> <p>Some economists think that even a rate cut next week, while welcome, would have little impact on businesses as global credit markets have frozen and banks are unwilling to lend to one another. </p> <p>\"The monetary policy committee is likely to look for further appropriate opportunities to support the economy and shore up confidence,\" Rob Dobson, a senior economist at Markit Economics, said. </p> <p>\"However, the recent detachment between central rates and Libor, on which most business borrowing is set, suggests an immediate cut in the central rate alone will not be sufficiently effective.\" </p> <p>Evidence that inflationary pressures are weakening will give the Bank's policymakers more scope to lower borrowing costs. </p> <p>The input price index, which measures manufacturers' costs, fell to a seven-month low of 73.7 from 78.1 in July, while the output price index, which gauges prices charged by firms, slipped to 62.6 from 64.5, its first easing this year.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>2.25pm:</strong> We'll be writing thousands of words about David Cameron's speech over the next few hours, but there's a simple way of determining whether a leader's party conference speech is a success and you can do it just as easily and competently as me: wait of a week and see what you remember.</p> <p>It's eight days after Gordon Brown addressed the Labour conference and it's now clear that the speech was only really remarkable for two things: the introduction from his wife, which was nice but doesn't make much difference in the scheme of things; and the \"it's no time for a novice\" line, which was powerful because it encapsulated all the doubts that voters have about Cameron (being young, lightweight, shallow etc) and it crystallised the argument that, at a time of global economic crisis, we're probably better off being led by a man with Brown's experience.</p> <p>Cameron's task this afternoon is very simple. Somehow - using rhetoric or reason - he has to answer the novice charge.</p> <p>Last night his team released some extracts from the speech that address this point directly. Cameron will say:</p> <blockquote> <p>There's a big argument I want to make - about the financial crisis and the economic downturn, but about other issues facing the country too. It's an argument about experience. To do difficult things for the long-term, or even to get us through the financial crisis in the short term, it's not experience we need, it's character and judgment. To rebuild our economy, it's not more of the same we need, but change. Experience is the argument of the incumbent over the ages. Experience is what they always say when they try to stop change.</p> </blockquote> <p>That sounds good, but on its own, and out of context, I can't tell whether this is really going to do the business.</p> <p>To assess whether I think he has answered Brown, I'll be looking at three things:</p> <p><strong>Policy:</strong> In his \"emergency\" statement yesterday Cameron said that people were \"confused and concerned\" and that they wanted to know what what was going on, what was going to happen next and \"how we're going to get out of this mess\". He said that in his speech today he would try to answer those questions in full. His answers had better be good.</p> <p><strong>Politics: </strong>Don't be fooled by all this stuff about cross-party cooperation. When politicians cooperate in the national interest, as Cameron and Brown are doing now to a limited extent over banking reform, they never stop thinking about how to maximise party-political advantage. It's just that they know it becomes infinitely harder to gauge the mood of the country and strike the right note. (For example, look at John McCain's cack-handed intervention in the US financial crisis.) Cameron has to make the Conservatives come over as a strong alternative to Labour, without appearing to exploit the crisis in a partisan manner. As political challenges go, this is about as hard as they get.</p> <p><strong>Personality:</strong> The novice charge was all about character. Cleverly, it turned Cameron's strengths (youth etc) into weaknesses. Cameron has to reassert his authority.</p> <p>Cameron starts speaking at about 2.50pm. I'll start live blogging shortly beforehand.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>2.55pm:</strong> Cameron will be starting very soon now. We've just had a series of A-list candidates doing short speeches and the shadow cabinet has come on to the stage. The press office has released the speech and I've had a quick skim through it. No new policy, very few jokes, and, although there's quite a bit about the economy, that doesn't dominate. There are strong passages about the NHS and the \"broken society\". If there's a killer soundbite, I haven't found it yet.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>2.55pm:</strong> But there are some sharp comments about Brown. I particularly like the line about taking away from the Bank of England the power to regulate the City in 1997: Brown \"changed the rules of the game but he took the referee off the pitch\". That explains the alleged Financial Services Authority \"mistake\" very clearly.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>3pm:</strong> Back to the conference. Liam Fox, the shadow defence secretary, is now at the podium, paying tribute to members of the armed forces.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>3pm:</strong> More stuff from the speech. After the bit about \"experience is what they always say when they try to stop change\", Cameron mentions Callaghan and Thatcher. \"If we had listened to this argument about experience, we'd never change a government ever. We'd have Gordon Brown as prime minister - for ever.\"</p> <p>That could the the soundbite, the line you remember this time next week.</p> <!-- Block 6 -->  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338166202\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Politics/Pix/pictures/2008/10/01/camerons22322.jpg\" alt=\"David Cameron and his wife, Samantha, at the Conservative party conference in Birmingham on October 1 2008.

Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA Wire</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>3pm:</strong> Cameron is coming on stage now. \"Ostentatiously carrying his speech,\" Nick Watt says.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>3.05pm:</strong> Cameron is not doing his \"from memory\" performance any more. His aides have suggested that reading a speech makes him sound more serious. (Although he might have just got bored with having to learn it too.)</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>3.05pm:</strong> Cameron says he will work with the government in the short-term to protect the economy. This gets hearty applause.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>3.05pm:</strong> Difficulties don't come in some \"neat and predictable order\", he says. This reminds me of the Barack Obama line about McCain having to realise that part of the president's job is dealing with more than one thing at a time.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>3.05pm:</strong> He's on to Afghanistan now. Party leaders often start their speeches with jokes, but this introductory passage is heavy, serious.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>3.05pm:</strong> Cameron says the government is not doing enough to protect British soldiers. There's a very powerful line that Cameron delivers passionately about businesses and hotels turning soldiers away - \"and that is wrong\". This goes down very well in the hall.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>3.10pm:</strong> He's moving on the the Gurkhas now. Nick Clegg, the Lib Dem leader, has probably done more to champion the interests of the Gurkhas in the Commons, but Cameron's appropriating the issue now. He urges the government not to appeal <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/oct/01/law.military1\">yesterday's high court ruling</a>. By raising the issue, he attacks the government implicitly, without directly having to mention Gordon Brown.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>3.10pm:</strong> Cameron is talking about character now. He says people want to know about politicians' values, because that determines how they act in a crisis. In his speech, Brown also made a point of asking to be judged on his values.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>3.10pm:</strong> He's not a a libertarian, he says, not someone who believes that people should do what they want regardless of its effect on others.</p> <p>\"For me, the most important word is responsibility.\"</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>3.15pm:</strong> He says that every time he takes a big decision, he asks if it will \"encourage responsibility\". Another implicit dig at Brown. There's an argument that, by allowing borrowing to get out of control, he was encouraging irresponsibility.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>3.15pm:</strong> \"You can't prove you're ready to be prime minister - and it would be arrogant to pretend that you can.\" That's an answer, of sorts, to the novice charge.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>3.15pm:</strong> He's a 41-year-old father of three who thinks the family is the most important thing there is. That's about the only reference to his family there is in this speech. I suppose he thinks (rightly) that we know enough about his family already.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>3.15pm:</strong> \"Trust your principles,\" will be his guide, he says. he says he will take decisions for the long-term. Tony Blair used to justify short-term initiatives on the grounds that \"we live in a 24-hour world\". \"But this is a country, not a television station.\"</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>3.15pm:</strong> It's a good line, and gets prolonged laughter. Interesting that he's attacked Blair before Brown.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>3.20pm:</strong> He's on to the \"experience\" passage now, and he's just delivered the \"thank God we swapped him for Margaret Thatcher\" line about James Callaghan. </p> <p>It gets the longest laugh so far. The line about Brown staying for ever falls a bit flat, because the audience could anticipate his line, but he adds something fun that's not in the text. \"I won't go on - there are people in balconies up there,\" he says - ie they would jump off at the thought.</p> <p>\"The risk is not making a change. The risk is sticking with what you've got and expecting a different result.\" That's clear, punchy.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>3.20pm:</strong> Cameron is moving onto the economic crisis now. It was quite simple, he says: \"the tap marked 'borrowing' was turned on - and it was left running for too long.\" That's a good, clear metaphor - and it explains what has gone wrong much more clearly than anything Brown has said about the crisis.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>3.25pm:</strong> Brown's worst decision (to take control of the City away from the Bank of England) was mixed up with his best one (Bank of England independence), he says. He's combining a criticism with a compliment, which sounds mature.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>3.25pm:</strong> Now Cameron is moving onto the \"what we need to do now\" passage. He points out that he studied economics at university (he did PPE at Oxford - so it wasn't just economics he read), but he says that beliefs count for more than this kind of experience.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>3.25pm:</strong> He believes in sound money, low taxes and fiscal responsibility. He's echoing now the themes of George Osborne's speech on Monday,which he describes as the best ever by a shadow chancellor. But I'm not sure he's adding anything new, or explaining it in a different manner.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>3.30pm:</strong> \"I'm a fiscal Conservative ... We do not believe in tax cuts paid by reckless borrowing.\" He imagines a calls centre worker or a hairdresser and says he knows they want some of their money back. Looking directly into the camera, he says: \"I want to give it to you.\" He conveys the impression very directly that he's speaking to the electorate.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>3.30pm:</strong> He's moving on to his respect for business now and he comes out with the best joke of the speech: \"I admire entrepreneurs. I should do - I go to bed with one every night.\" After the laughter dies down, he adds: \"And I wake up with the same one every morning.\" That line wasn't in the script, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's spontaneous. Politicians often prepare these lines, but keep them out of the text.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>3.35pm:</strong> There's a lot of laughter from colleagues who, unlike me, aren't staring at a computer screen. That's because the TV camera has just panned to a shot of Theresa May, the shadow leader of the Commons.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>3.35pm:</strong> Cameron is moving on to the role of the state now. He says David Miliband told the Labour conference that \"unless government is on your side, you end up on your own\" and he says it was \"one of the most arrogant things I've heard a politician say\".</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>3.35pm:</strong> The problem isn't Brown or any of his other ministers. It's Labour, and their \"total lack of trust in people's common sense\".</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>3.35pm:</strong> Police officers can't pursue an armed criminal without filling out a risk assessment form, and teachers can't put a plaster on a child's knee without calling a first aid officer. He says these things are true, but I'm not convinced. Are they? Does anyone know? If it turns out he's exaggerating, it will be embarrassing given the way he attacked Brown for twisting an Osborne quote in his speech last week.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>3.40pm:</strong> Now he's on to trust in politics and he attacks the Westminster culture of \"copper-bottomed pensions\" and \"plasma-screen TVs on the taxpayer\".</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>3.40pm:</strong> Cameron says he's going to tell us how he's going to improve public services. \"Sharing responsibility and giving it back to professionals.\"</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>3.40pm:</strong> On the NHS, he says Labour has taken \"our most treasured national institutions, ripped out its soul and replaced it with targets, directives, management consultants and computers\". Again, I think he's at risk of going over the top now. Is this how most people experience the NHS?</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>3.45pm:</strong> But he has a powerful story to back it up. He reads a moving letter from a constituent whose wife caught MRSA in hospital and then died after appalling treatment. Cameron passed his letter on to Alan Johnson, the health secretary, but got a particularly bureaucratic reply. </p> <p>Reading out a list of organisations he was told he could complain to, Cameron says: \"Four ways to make a complaint, but not one way for Mr Woods's wife to die with dignity. By God, we need to change that.\" He rises to an angry, rhetorical crescendo. It's the most powerful moment of the speech so far.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>3.45pm:</strong> \"We are the party of the NHS and under my leadership that is how it's going to stay.\" A bold claim.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>3.45pm:</strong> Cameron is on to the \"broken society\" now and he describes working with Helen Newlove, whose husband Garry was kicked to death. She knows society is \"broken\", he says. But she - and he - believes it can be fixed.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>3.45pm:</strong> \"Come with me to Wandsworth prison,\" he says. Not the best invitation you'll get.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>3.50pm:</strong> But he's talking sensibly, and sensitively, about the link between social deprivation and crime. \"Miss the cause ... and you'll never get the true picture of why crime is so high in our country.\" Or \"tough on the causes of crime\", as someone else used to say.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>3.50pm:</strong> Cameron says he's not anti-state and that he acknowledges the success state-run programmes have had in fighting poverty.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>3.50pm:</strong> But today \"the returns from endless big-state intervention are not just diminishing, they are disappearing\".</p> <p>The family is \"the best welfare system there is\".</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>3.50pm:</strong> He's defending flexible working now, saying that business pays the cost of family breakdown. Women are \"half the talent of the country\". Or, as his wife Samantha told him, more than half, he jokes.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>3.55pm:</strong> And this takes him to his decision to back marriage in the tax system, a controversial proposal which Labour routinely attacks, on the grounds that it would penalise the children of divorcees and widows, and about which Osborne is said to be sceptical.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>3.55pm:</strong> Cameron says he doesn't want to aggravate anyone, but commitment is important. \"Many of us, me included, will always remember that moment when you say, up there in front of others, it's not just me any more, it's us, together, and that helps to take you through the tough times.\" That goes down very well too.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>4pm:</strong> On to education, and Cameron takes a swipe at the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority for allowing a child to receive marks for writing \"F off\" on an exam paper. (I remember hearing someone being interviewed about this - I think the argument was that writing something is better than writing nothing, and it was only two marks.) Cameron says he would have two words of his own for people like that: you're fired.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>4.05pm:</strong> Cameron now has a go at the so-called \"couple penalty\". He says he was in a benefits office where an official told a woman she would be better off living apart from her boyfriend. \"What on earth are we doing with a system like that?\"</p> <p>He pays tribute to Iain Duncan Smith for making the Conservative party \"the party of social justice\".</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>4.05pm:</strong> He praises his party for having the courage to change. \"You didn't pick more women candidates to try to look good, you did it so we wouldn't lock out talent.\" Probably true - up to a point.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>4.10pm:</strong> Winding up, he says these are difficult times that require \"character and judgment\". The character to stick to your guns and not bottle it. \"Leadership, character, judgment. That's what Britain needs at a time like this and that's what this party now offers.\"</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>4.10pm:</strong> The Tories are united \"because we had the courage to change\".</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>4.10pm:</strong> He leaves the stage to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZTsW8WKy5c\">Let's Stick Together, by Bryan Ferry</a>, who, of course, is the father of pro-hunting campaigner Otis Ferry.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>4.10pm:</strong> At the end Samantha comes on stage. Andrew Neil on the BBC says he thinks it's a \"Daily Mail\" speech. All those stories about risk assessment forms probably come out of Daily Mail cuttings.</p> <p>But has he answered the \"novice\" charge? Here's my assessment according to the three criteria I set out earlier.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>Policy:</strong> There was nothing remotely new in policy terms, but that isn't necessarily a problem. Cameron promised that he would explain his approach to the economic crisis and there was an important passage about this. I think he explained what went wrong in terms that were clear and memorable. I particularly liked the tap-running metaphor and the one about the referee being taken off the pitch. As punchy analysis goes, this is as good as you could expect from any politician. But I don't think he did anything new to explain to the public how the Conservatives would do things differently. He echoed what Osborne said about the (well-received) economic recovery plan, but he didn't say anything at all about the problems on Brown's desk this week, such as whether or not to guarantee all bank deposits and how to stop all the UK's savers putting their cash in Irish bank accounts (which are fully insured).</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>Politics:</strong> This was hard, and I thought Cameron pitched his speech well. He avoided blunt, personal attacks on Brown, of the kind he has been happy to make before and which could have seemed inappropriate in the present circumstances. But it was still a partisan speech, with plenty to delight the Tory faithful, that presented a coherent account of how a Conservative government would be different.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>Politics:</strong> This was hard, and I thought Cameron pitched his speech well.

(That's not as stupid a way of judging speeches as it sounds. There's some plausible research to the effect that politicians who \"look best\" on TV - regardless of what they say - are also likely to be the ones who win the approval of voters.) And with the sound up, Cameron intelligently and plausibly answered the novice line. \"That's what the old guys always say\" was part of it. And the other argument was: \"If you want change, don't expect Mr Experience to deliver.\" But I find it significant that I can't put my finger on a key quote in the speech that sums this up brilliantly. \"Experience is the excuse of the incumbent over the ages,\" was good. And the line about Brown going on for ever worked. And \"the risk is sticking with what you've got and expecting a different result\". But I'm not sure whether these are as pithy as \"no time for a novice\".</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p>Wait a week and then ask yourself if you can remember any of them. If you can, Cameron's answered the charge. If you can't, the speech failed.</p>",
  "<p>The road to the World Series begins tonight with the first round of the post-season, the best-of-five games Divisional Series. The winners will play for the American League and National League Championships starting next week.</p> <h2>Boston Red Sox v Los Angeles Angels</h2> <p>In a season full of extraordinary occurrences, it was mostly business as usual for these two teams and that means winning. There was one major bump in the road for the Sox and that was what to do with Manny Ramirez, whose antics in the clubhouse led management to believe that Manny could no longer be Manny in Boston. One of the greatest hitters in Major League Baseball was dealt to the LA Dodgers, leaving the incoming Jason Bay to fill his Titanic-sized shoes in left field. The team took off and, following their sub .500 July, the post-Manny era began with a 34-19 finish to the season.</p> <p>With a superb offense led by Dustin Pedroia and an above average pitching staff, the Sox cruised to a second-place finish in the AL East behind Tampa. The Bosox come in a bit banged up, with Mike Lowell, JD Drew and Josh Beckett, who will now pitch Game Three, nursing injuries. Boston are usually under enormous pressure to win, but following two World Series titles in four seasons, 2008 is a freebie. Whatever happens, the Red Sox Nation can't possibly complain.</p> <p>Not so for the Angels, who won 100 games and made a serious upgrade when they traded for first baseman Mark Teixeira in July. This is a team that once lacked the pop to go with their pitching, but now that they have it, there's no excuse not to reach the World Series. There could be a concern that while the Sox played in what could be considered the best division in baseball, the Angels have been playing cupcakes in the AL West all season long. Last year they got trounced by Boston in the ALDS, so Mike Scioscia's men will have revenge on their minds as they have another crack at Boston. LA's fans know that this could be their last season with their dominating, soon-to-be free-agent closer Francisco Rodriguez, so they are desperate to win it all with him in an Angels uniform. Did I mention that LA beat Boston eight out of nine games this season?</p> <p><strong>Prediction time:</strong> Heavenly results for Angels</p> <h2>Chicago White Sox v Tampa Bay Rays</h2> <p>I can't believe I'm writing a playoff preview that includes the team from Tampa \u2014 this is the latest proof that anything can happen in baseball. We knew that the franchise, which finished in last place nine of its 10 seasons, were inching along, but who knew that they would eat up the AL East? Division champions? What? We better get used to the Rays shining down on baseball, because they're built to last longer than the octogenarians watching their games down in their dome. They won't mow you down with star power, but as far as team goes, they are a tight unit, a bit like, dare I say, the Yankee dynasty before they started signing expensive free agents.</p> <p>Their superb staff, led by lefty-ace Scott Kazmir, has the second-best ERA in the AL, and their bullpen is better than good. If former closer Troy Percival snaps back into form, which he showed signs of this weekend, the relief core will be an even tougher nut to crack. Offensively, Joe Maddon's team is speedy with a couple of boppers in the lineup, but they could struggle to score runs against playoff pitching. The dome could be their biggest weapon \u2014 they're 57-24 at home, and they have the extra game at Tropicana Field in the ALDS.</p> <p>The wildcard-winning Chicago White Sox don't have the starting rotation they enjoyed in 2005, but they could have just enough to beat Tampa. John Danks put together a career start in their <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/feedarticle/7841558\">play-in victory over the Minnesota Twins last night</a>, good news for Sox fans that watched this team dodge bullets all season long. Manager Ozzie Guillen's goal is to get South Siders to forget about 2005 and make it all about 2008, and now that the Chisox have scraped into the final eight, there's every chance that veterans Jim Thome and Ken Griffey Jr will make the most of what could be their final opportunity to win a championship. This is a hungry, charismatic, well-rounded team with a lot to offer. I like their chances, even without injured slugger Carlos Quentin.</p> <p><strong>Prediction time:</strong> Chisox sun block stops Rays</p> <h2>Los Angeles Dodgers v Chicago Cubs</h2> <p>When you talk Dodgers, you talk Joe Torre. The manager of four World Series titles told the Yankees to take their job and shove it after getting an offer he could refuse after last season. Now Yankee Stadium is dark, while his Dodgers are division title winners for the first time since 2004. Coincidence? Ramirez's arrival in Hollywood had much to do with the Dodgers winning in a poor NL West, but Torre steered the ship through several storms and found land down the stretch.</p> <p>Manny recently said he regretted some of his behaviour while spending an unhappy eight years in Boston, and thus far has been something of a model citizen in LA. Now two old foes from the uptight east coast are taking it easy out west, catching a cool wave to the playoffs and seeing what they can do against the favoured Cubs. Without a full-strength Jeff Kent and Rafael Furcal, it won't be easy, but the pitching will help. Their top-ranked ERA is packed with right-handed starters, while the Cubs have a plethora of right-handed power \u2014 that's good news for LA.</p> <p>The bad news is that the Cubs also have a seriously deep rotation, and even if their bullpen isn't as good as LA's, Chicago can score runs ... lots of them. The whole team is stacked with household names such as Derek Lee, Alfonso Soriano, Carlos Zambrano and Aramis Ramirez. They should beat LA, especially because they have an extra game at Wrigley Field where they won 55 games at home, one short of a franchise record. There's just one problem, and that's this little issue they have with the supernatural, a 100-year curse which supposedly prevents them from winning a World Series title. Are you a believer?</p> <p><strong>Prediction time:</strong> Torre ousted in the first round ... again</p> <h2>Milwaukee Brewers v Philadelphia Phillies</h2> <p>It's been a long time between drinks for Milwaukee, unusual for a team called the Brewers. Twenty-six years ago Milwaukee lost to the St Louis Cardinals in the World Series, and since then there's been a lot of losing. Finally, there's something to cheer about in Wisconsin besides the Green Bay Packers. The Brewers tried to throw away a playoff berth for the second consecutive season by stumbling and getting their manager, Ned Yost, fired as the season neared its end. The Mets wouldn't let them, and Milwaukee finally ended their post-season drought.</p> <p>All-world hurler CC Sabathia had a lot to do with it \u2014 his superhuman efforts included three straight outings on short rest, including a dominating performance on the final day of the season when his team needed it most. After CC the rotation gets extremely shaky with the talented Ben Sheets out again with injury, and the bullpen, while well above average, has been prone to collapse. What a lineup though, one packed with beef, or in this case, tofu. The Brew Crew's slugger Prince Fielder doesn't eat meat, but he's big and he can hit. So can Ryan Braun, who had a flare for the dramatic down the stretch.</p> <p>Can they beat the Phillies? They did this season, but only once in five games. The question is how will Philadelphia deal with playoff pressure? Last season Philadelphia celebrated their triumph over the Mets in the NL East by getting slaughtered by a Colorado team on a once-in-a-lifetime roll. Will that be in the back of Charlie Manuel's baseball brain when preparing his team for battle with the Brewers? We know that his club can hit, which makes sense because they were built to play in a pint-sized park, and slugger Ryan Howard is coming off an insane September. Can they pitch enough to navigate through Milwaukee's lineup? The pressure is off the Brewers now that they're in, so odds are they won't be squeezing the bat too hard in trying to hit five-run homers. That spells trouble for the Phils, whose bullpen, led by Brad Lidge, is better than their starters.</p> <p><strong>Prediction time:</strong> There's a hop in the Brewers step and the Crew is due</p> <h2>A long and emotional goodbye</h2> <p>On Sunday night at Shea Stadium, I jogged from right to left field, ran the bases, peeked inside the famed Home Run Apple, checked out the bullpen, rolled around the outfield, collected dirt, dug up sod from the foul line and pitchers mound, threw a baseball, and sat in the dugout. Hours earlier, the Mets suffered a crushing defeat to the Florida Marlins, one which sealed the fate of their season and their 45-year-old stadium, a place where I've been watching baseball since my first game in 1983. There would be no playoffs for the Mets, no more game days for Shea.</p> <p>The events surrounding their ousting were eerily similar to last season's nightmarish finish \u2014 in 2007, the Marlins were also in town for the final series of the campaign. In the penultimate game a year ago, with the Mets needing a win to boost their post-season chances, John Maine nearly threw the first no-hitter in franchise history, keeping the team alive for one more day. Johan Santana did the same on Saturday, dazzling the Shea faithful in what may have been the greatest regular-season pitching performance in the history of the yard, a complete game, three-hit shutout. Then came Sunday.</p> <p>Hopes were high that Mets fans would not see a repeat of 2007's game No162, when Tom Glavine couldn't get out of the first inning and the Marlins trounced the Mets, finishing off their record September collapse. Although Florida didn't score seven first-inning runs off Mets starter Oliver Perez on Sunday, the final result was the same. Milwaukee, tied with the Mets for the final wildcard spot, beat the Cubs minutes before New York's Ryan Church made the final out at Shea. The Mets were out of the playoff mix, again, on the final day of the season, falling drastically short of expectations.</p> <p>September 28 had been circled on my calendar since the baseball schedules came out \u2014 if there were no playoffs, it would be the last day at Shea. Securing tickets for as many games as possible was given top priority; it was a summer of pilgrimages to the working-class venue that many feel is a dump. For me it's anything but, a place so deeply ingrained in my soul that I can't imagine not watching baseball in its sky-high upper deck, where you can practically touch the airplanes heading in and out of nearby LaGuardia airport. I was desperate for the Mets to make the playoffs, not because that's what most fans want, a chance to win the title, but to keep Shea alive for as long as possible \u2014 that's what this season was about. Now it's all over.</p> <p>It was a long day. I arrived at Shea at 9.30am, camera in hand, and began snapping photos inside and out, from just about every angle possible. After the game there was an emotional closing ceremony featuring dozens of former Mets, at Shea to say their goodbyes to the fans inside the park they called home. As fans filed out for the final time, I hung around on the field, soaking in the sights, waiting to be kicked out. Shea was nearly empty except for the ushers, team employees and their families, and stadium security police.</p> <p>In baseball, the press know that walking beyond the dirt and on to the field is forbidden, but little by little I began walking towards the outfield, seeing how far I could get. No one stopped me, and I wondered if this is how East and West Germans felt when the Berlin wall came down. Cops asked me to take their photos on the pitchers mound, kids ran bases, ushers chatted on the bullpen phones, and I spent the next hour roaming around parts of Shea I never dreamed I could be. Then the rains came, washing us off the field, flooding the old dugouts. It was time to go. I said goodbye, hopped on my bicycle, and pulled away from Shea never to return.</p>",
  "<p>Strains in global money markets eased somewhat today, particularly for overnight funds, and two Bank of England auctions for fresh liquidity were under-subscribed.</p> <p>Analysts said the market had been helped by massive injections of overnight liquidity to get troubled banks over the end of the third quarter, which matters to them for book-keeping purposes.</p> <p>London interbank interest rates for overnight money, known as Libor, which are set by the demand for and supply of money, dropped sharply in the British Bankers' Association daily fixing just before noon.</p> <p>For sterling funds the rate dropped to 4.96% from 6.78% yesterday.

  "<p><a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7645319.stm\">Alex Salmond's call to guarantee all savings</a> is a huge irritation to the prime minister and the UK Treasury, who have been desperately avoiding giving any such guarantee. Salmond called on the chancellor, Alistair Darling to emulate the action taken by the Irish taoiseach, Brian Cowan, to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/01/banking.executivesalaries\">guarantee all deposits in the six main Irish banks</a> for two years. The British government is incensed by the action, which may cause a flight of funds from beleaguered British banks across the Irish sea. </p> <p>The trouble is that the UK government would find it very difficult to guarantee the trillions in UK banks, which is why Gordon Brown has been choosing his words very carefully and avoiding giving any universal commitment to save depositors funds in the event of bank failure. If he did the markets might call Britain's bluff and desert sterling. If foreign investors believe the UK could not honour such a guarantee there would be little incentive for them to remain. So, it could lead to precisely the reverse of what was intended \u2013 securing the stability of the UK banking system.</p> <p>Salmond knows this perfectly well, of course, which is why he made the call. He wants to draw attention to the fact that Ireland, a small independent country of similar size to Scotland, can indeed have its own banking system and its own regulatory regime. Labour's claim, since the collapse of HBOS has been that Scotland is \"too wee\" to be able to manage on its own affairs , and that an independent Scotland would be an economic \"Brigadoon\". The new Scottish Labour leader, <a href=\"http://www.theyworkforyou.com/sp/?id=2008-09-24.11095.0\">Iain Gray</a>, has been <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/scotland/3055922/Iain-Gray-tells-Labour-conference-Get-behind-Gordon-Brown-to-beat-Alex-Salmonds-SNP.html\">contemptuous of the SNP's response</a> to the HBOS crisis and has said that if Scotland had been independent all 17,000 jobs would have been lost. Salmond was stung by charges that he was being vainglorious in suggesting that an independent Scotland could have organised a \u00a3100bn bail out of HBOS. Now he is claiming the initiative again, arguing that small countries need not be impotent in the face of global economic turbulence, and that big is not necessarily best. </p> <p>The SNP is of course committed to independence in Europe and this is the other element in the nationalist back story. Salmond wants to draw attention to the fact that membership of the EU allows the Irish to take steps like this with the tacit support of the European Central Bank. The message is this: Scotland would not be alone and defenceless out of the UK. It could, perhaps, have saved HBOS. It's a hard sell though: Ireland's actions are borne of desperation at the near collapse of the entire Irish banking structure. And it remains to be seen whether the Irish guarantee sticks.</p>",

  "<p>The numbers might look as good now as we had hoped at the beginning of the year, said <strong>Andrew Walmsley</strong> of <strong><a href=\"http://www.i-level.com/Homepage\">i-level</a></strong>, but the outlook is still for significant growth - 18% in digital this year.\"In the next few years we're going to se a shift to digital being at the core of meeting communications. Digital is becoming for some brand the key environment in which we talk to consumers, sell to them and the key place that we go and listen to what they have to say. That's a big challenge to agencies who come at this from a different direction.\"</p> <p>Walmsley said the large inventories but low ad rates of social networking can be explained through the different dynamics of those communities. \"Social networks change the tacit contract between consumers and media owners. With ITV people know that this is ITV's content and accept that they will be interrupted with an advert. On social networks, people think 'this is our media', which means they think advertisers don't have an automatic right to be there.</p> <p>\"That doesn't mean advertisers can't be there, but does explain why the yields are so poor on social networking sites.\"</p> <p><strong>Just keep investing</strong></p> <p>The <strong>Guardian</strong> owes its early lead in the online news market to its decision to invest during the last economic downturn.</p> <p>\"Times are going to be uniquely tough - worse than 2001-2002, as bad as 1990 and I think it is to separate the cynical from the systemic, and the systemic is about online growth and sustaining audiences online,\" she said.</p> <p>\"We own our lead in the market - which has only recently been challenged because of serious investment and we welcome that - to the fact that people like <strong>Simon</strong> [<strong>Waldman</strong>, director digital strategy], <strong>Alan</strong> [<strong>Rusbridger</strong>, editor] and <strong>Carolyn</strong> [<strong>McCall</strong>, chief executive] kept putting money into the business at a time when it would have been easy to say we don't know what the future holds.\"</p> <p>The current climate necessitates a different way of thinking about how to invest; the business might benefit from cheaper video technology or international expansion, but may also have to do less in subject areas where it has smaller audiences.</p> <p>The moment when things changed for the Guardian was 9/11, when the site started to build an international audience. She said the Guardian believes there is an international audience for its kind of journalism, and that although the advertising business around that has not yet solidified there is a belief that \"pounds, dollars and rupees\" will still follow that audience.</p> <p><strong>Broadcasters need to get to grips with engagement</strong></p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.endemol.com/\">Endemol</a></strong> digital media managing director <strong>Peter Cowley</strong> said social networks have given a voice to exciting new talent, such as the 20-year-old web producer <strong><a href=\"http://www.bebo.com/Profile.jsp?MemberId=6493365168\">Tom Thurlow</a></strong>. \"There's only so much innovation that can happen organically, in-house... social networks give people the power to cut through to a new audience that a lot of broadcasters are looking for. They are helping us create the best ideas and will appear in a lot of our ideas in the future.\"</p> <p>Cowley said as much as 50% of TV viewing could be through PVRs or video-on-demand services by switchover in 2012. \"Higher bandwidth and mobility, coupled with huge changes in those peer-to-peer conversations through social networks, will have a huge impact on how we produce content. It will force us to combine video, text, audio and pictures and to rethink how engagement works.</p> <p>\"Those things still haven't come together in one great package, so that's what we have to learn and we have to hope that advertisers keep up with that as well.\"</p> <p><strong>Don't stop innovating</strong></p> <p><strong>Ajaz Ahmed</strong>, founder of <strong><a href=\"http://www.akqa.com/\">AKQA</a></strong>, referred to an anecdote from a big technology brand in the US. It used to be that the brand relied on the saliency of the media owners, but now consumers like the brand more than those media properties; some brand properties have traffic as high as the biggest media properties. It comes down to innovation, he said.</p> <p>\"It used to be the case the media owner was always ahead of the advertiser, and the advertiser was always ahead of the consumer. But the barriers to creating content are so low that we have incredibly innovative consumers who use new software to create a platform for fame themselves. There's a need for relentless innovation - in a world of perfect information, media owners need to be focused on innovation, quality and being the best value and that delivers success.\"</p>",
  "<p>Britain must \"hold fast\" to its green agenda despite the economic crisis, the shadow environment secretary insisted today.</p> <p>Citing the current global economic problems reverberating in Britain, Peter Ainsworth told delegates at the Conservative conference in Birmingham that efforts to tackle the financial meltdown had to go hand in hand with tough commitments to tackling climate change.</p> <p>\"We were promised no more boom and bust and look what happened,\" he said. \"But when it comes to the global environment, if that goes bust there will be no boom ever again.\"</p> <p>He said \"going green\" would make the country safer and better off.</p> <p>\"These are difficult times. But we must, and will, hold fast to the green agenda. Don't let anyone tell you there is a choice between the economy and the environment. There simply isn't.\"</p> <p>There was an \"urgent need\" for Britain to forge a greener economy in light of the country's dependency on foreign oil, spiralling food prices and the threat to jobs, he said. </p> <p>And he rounded on the government for sending out what he said were inconsistent signals on the environment.</p> <p>\"It's no good ministers going around the world lecturing countries like India and China about carbon emissions and then ushering a new generation of dirty coal-fired power stations - or building a third runway at Heathrow regardless of the impact on the local and global environment.</p> <p>\"Why should anyone take lectures from Labour when over half of all government departments have bigger carbon emissions than a decade ago.\"</p> <p>Also speaking at the environment debate was Bill Bryson, the bestselling author, who issued a heartfelt plea to the Conservatives to do more to tackle the menace of litter. </p> <p>Bryson, the president of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, which is mounting a \"stop the drop\" campaign, said it was time to \"fight back\" against the tide of rubbish littering the nation's streets and countryside.</p> <p>\"We believe that a countryside as lovely as Britain deserves better than to be routinely trashed,\" he said. </p> <p>In a well-received speech, Bryson said that England's \"precious and rare\" landscape deserved to be cherished - and on the whole it was. </p> <p>\"Just one thing stands between it and perfection - and that is litter. It's become the default condition of a great deal of the British landscape, and fly-tipping is making matters even worse.\" </p> <p>\"No one wants to live in a country that's only lovely from the ankles up,\" Bryson added.</p> <p>The party faithful were promised that a Conservative government would fund moves to ensure local authorities universally returned to weekly bin collections.</p> <p>Eric Pickles, the shadow communities and local government secretary, said the current rate of cuts in local government would see the weekly bin collections disappear within five years. </p> <p>\"We reject Labour's army of bin bullies and bin taxes,\" he said. \"That is why David Cameron has pledged that we will provide funding to allow all councils to introduce a proper weekly rubbish collection, on top of recycling.\"</p> <p>Pickles condemned the government's plans to \"bulldoze\" the green belt to meet housing targets. </p> <p>\"Instead of working with councils, rewarding growth and ensuring that the infrastructure is in place, Labour has relied on overbearing targets enforced by servile, obedient quangos,\" he said.</p> <p>Pickles vowed to scrap the government's \"quangorate\" infrastructure commission, designed to oversee major projects and speed up the planning process. </p> <p>\"We are going to put local communities back in charge,\" he said to applause. </p> <p>\"We are going to have county councillors responsible for their actions. Nobody is going to be able to hide behind decisions made miles away.\"</p> <p>Pickles insisted that this would not lead to more \"nimbyism\", where local people refuse housing developments in their backyards.</p>",
  "<p>Things must have reached a pretty serious pickle with the economy when the Daily Mail tries to cheer up its readers. It is a paper quite brilliant at frightening them (\"immigrants give you cancer,\" a Mail colleague joked the other day). Yet today it <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1065392/There-ARE-reasons-cheerful-Fifteen-glorious-things-free.html\">devotes a prime page</a> to a lovely autumnal photograph, plus 15 ways to brighten one's day, all of them free. It is a challenge to us all.</p> <p>Apart from wholesome suggestions like walking in the park, picking blackberries or watching Harry Enfield reruns on TV, at least two of the 15 are clearly incitements to sexual activity, something usually to be deplored by the Mail, albeit in great detail. </p> <p>Suggestion six is to share a bath to save water (\"After all, austerity is meant to bring people together\u2026). Suggestion nine suggests going to bed early \"to cuddle up.\" It's this kind of carrying on which led to the decline and fall of the Roman empire. Enough said: we are all doomed.</p> <p>It prompts me to wonder if the rest of us could do any better than the Mail's 15 pick-me-up tonics for anxious readers, any better than a trip to Buckingham Palace for the changing of the guard (\"a wonderful spectacle\") or getting free online tickets to see Jeremy Clarkson, our prime minister-in-waiting, doing Top Gear.</p> <p>Myself, I've been drafting the bankers reform (capital punishment) bill, which would have required the more culpable \u2013 Northern Rock's Adam Applecart for example \u2013 to appear on a financial version of the Big Brother house, discussing how brilliant their strategy was and why it went wrong. Viewers (distraught shareholders would get two votes) would then vote them out and the winner would be allowed to live.</p> <p>Unfortunately, all commentators - from sensible left to only slightly deranged right - appear to agree with David Cameron that the Day of Reckoning must be postponed while we rescue the banking system from their shortsighted folly and greed. Why? Because Wall St intersects with Main St, as <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0fa9d526-8eec-11dd-946c-0000779fd18c.html\">Martin Wolf</a> put it today's FT.</p> <p>In fact, there seems to be an emerging consensus \u2013 dangerous word \u2013 that the rescue boats had better be less harsh to the shareholders than it has been in both Britain and the US in some cases up to now. </p> <p>Why? Because not all potential victims deserve to collapse, nor do they deserve to see rivals or governments take over their bank at fire sale prices when the price may eventually recover. After all, it's irrational panic at work here much of the time.</p> <p>All this is painful and we are all learning on the way. When the 100 members of the US Senate votes tonight on the Paulson/Bush recovery plan it may improve the package the 435-strong House of Representatives rejected this week. That's how progress is made, though passed the package must be if we don't want Armageddon in the high st.</p> <p>Where was I? Ah, yes, in search of suggestions for cheering us all up. The Mail is right to say there are a lot of things which are free, many of them involving simple pleasures like walking and looking at the world around us, which busy people tend to neglect.</p> <p>Recession may cure us of daft extravagances we have accumulated too. My wife is devoted to a drink she calls a \"skinny latte\" which I will certainly curb if economic opportunity arises. But my No 1 priority would be to target \u2013 in the name of austerity - bottles of overpriced water, allegedly drawn from some sparkling spring in Umbria.</p> <p>You see otherwise sensible people walking round nowadays clutching these bottles as if they were life-saving gas masks. This is a new development, no more than 10 years old, I would guess. What happened? How did we manage before? How did our sturdy forefathers and mothers survive the blitz or the depression without their swig of tasteless Evian? </p> <p>If we must carry water, let's take it from the tap, as I am always saying to Mrs White, who combines the search for water with the search for a loo on many an otherwise enjoyable trip. </p> <p>Yet she was with me many years ago when we passed the Perrier factory at Verg\u00e8ze in the south of France. From a distance it looked more like Fords of Dagenham in its heyday than the famously naturally-carbonated spring of antiquity. </p> <p>Unlike Fords, Perrier is still shipping its famous product (bottled to look like the Indian clubs used by a disabled member of the Mail-owning Harmsworth family who once owned the firm*) is still being expensively shipped hither and thither at great cost to the environment and the consumer. All that heavy glass!</p> <p>The over-priced mineral water (racket) bill could outlaw the practice to the great benefit of mankind, allowing us to go out and pick blackberries with both hands. There, I feel cheerier already. It is amazing how effective is the power of positive thought. </p> <p>All I have to do now is listen to David Cameron's speech closing the Tory conference \u2013 don't be too gloomy, Dave! \u2013 then go home after three weeks of conferencing and get stuck into blackberrying. No, not that sort of BlackBerry. We won't be able to afford to use such over-priced contraptions any more.</p> <p>* Sir St John Harmsworth, younger brother of the great press magnate and first Lord Northcliffe, brought the spring and spa company off a local doctor at the turn of the 1900s. He was confined to a wheelchair and his exercise routine is said to have inspired the Perrier bottle shape as it turned the spa into a water business. </p> <p>The Mail helped promote the brand \u2013 some things don't change \u2013 as the champagne of mineral waters \u2013 see what I mean \u2013 but, alas, Harmsworth sold the company before it became such a worldwide hit. You may consider that another reason to whistle today as you struggle through the circling gloom.</p>",
  "<p>Pablo Picasso was, we know, the most influential artist of the 20th century. His innovations in perspective and technique dazzled (and sometimes baffled) the art world for decades, while paving the way for many of the important artistic movements of the last century. What we're inclined to overlook, though, is that Picasso was also a poet. Now it's not unusual for artists to work in mediums outside their own. What makes Picasso's experiment in poetry different, however, is the skill he displayed. In fact, it has been argued that if Picasso had never picked up paintbrush he would today still be remembered as a major Spanish poet.</p> <p>Picasso's interest in poetry comes as no surprise to those familiar with his life. From his earliest days in Paris, he liked to surround himself with poets, including luminaries such as Max Jacob, Guillaume Apollinaire, Andr\u00e9 Breton, and Jean Cocteau. Through these relationships Picasso was always highly aware of what was going on in contemporary European poetry. It wasn't until he was 54, though, contending with impasses in his visual art and personal life, that <a href=\"http://www.cipherjournal.com/html/picasso.html\">Picasso finally tried his hand at poetry himself</a>. The result was a torrent of words that continued for nearly 25 years. </p> <p>The work, unsurprisingly, owes a great deal to his training as painter, in that he eschews the typical musical foundation of verse (Picasso never care much for music) and <a href=\"http://web.org.uk/picasso/poems.html\">treats his words more like brushstrokes</a>. Additionally, taking cues from his own cubist breakthroughs and surrealist notions a la Breton, he generally throws traditional notions of grammar, structure, and punctuation out the window, allowing him to create crowded, often daunting collages of images, ideas, and emotions, as exemplified by the following translated excerpts:</p> <p>\u2026 the street be full of stars<br>and the prisoners eat doves<br>and the doves eat cheese<br>and the cheese eat words<br>and the words eat bridges<br>and the bridges eat looks<br>and the looks eat cups full of kisses in the <em>orchata</em><br>that hides all with its wings<br>the butterfly the night<br>in caf\u00e9 last summer<br>in Barcelona</p> <p>&#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; \u2026 outsized flood of doves released drunk on <br>the cutting festoons of prisms fixed to the bells decomposing with its thousand<br>lit candles the green flocks of wool illuminated by the gentle acrobatics of<br>the lanterns hanging from each arc string and the definitive dawn</p> <p>Like his paintings, Picasso's poems are not always easy to interpret. Some, frankly, are quite impenetrable. However, the relentless onslaught of his words is almost always invigorating, especially in their breathless demolition of traditional poetic forms. In fact, for poetry fans feeling themselves bogged down in the portentous or just plain overwrought, Picasso's childlike, wildly flung wordscapes might be a perfect antidote.</p> <p>Picasso wrote in both Spanish and French, but sadly English translations of Picasso's poetry are not abundant. <a href=\"http://www.readersread.com/cgi-bin/bookblog.pl?bblog=318051\">The Burial of the Count of Orgaz &amp; Other Poems</a>, released in 2004, is a handsome volume that collects a large portion of Picasso's writing and is highly recommended. Beyond this, his work appears in a number of anthologies, including Penguin's widely available Surrealist Poetry in English. Also worth searching out is Hunk of Skin, an out-of-print collection published by Lawrence Ferlinghetti's City Lights in 1968 that is available in many used venues, often at a fairly reasonable price.</p> <p>When all is said and done Pablo Picasso is obviously a visual artist first and a poet second. Still his work rises far above the typical dabblings that usually emerge from an artist trying to cross into another form of expression. Whether or not Picasso should be ranked as a \"major Spanish poet\", as many of his literary supporters claim, he certainly is an interesting writer who cannot and should not be easily dismissed.</p>",

  "<p>Brazil's new environment minister, Carlos Minc, announced this week that he will be pressing for criminal charges against 100 of the worst individuals or companies responsible for most of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/30/forests.brazil\">deforestation</a> since 2005. New figures just released show that the rate of deforestation has increased by 133% since last month in the nine states of the Amazon region, which is an increase of 228% compared to a year ago.</p> <p>Minc also said that the government will create an environmental police force with 3,000 heavily armed and specially trained officers to enforce the law. \"I am a pacifist and environmentalist,\" he told journalists, \"but without greater repression we are not going to end the destruction of the Amazon.\"</p> <p>Top of Minc's list of culprits is the <a href=\"http://www.incra.gov.br/\">Brazilian National Institute for Agrarian Reform</a> (Inrca), responsible for finding land for Brazil's large landless population, whose settlements in the Amazon are ranked amongst the top eight worst offenders. However, Incra's president, Rolf Hackbart, rejected the idea of bringing criminal proceedings as \"absurd\" saying that it will only serve to undermine the government's agrarian reforms.</p> <p>Brazil faces two related environmental problems, based on its highly unequal system of land ownership, which means that a tiny elite hold massive estates, while millions remain landless. Increased mechanisation and the spread of cash crops has driven large numbers of these into the Amazon, where they clear land for farming using cash and burn techniques. This, and illegal logging for Brazil's high quality wood, has steadily increased the pressure on the rainforest and is also a major cause of global warming.</p> <p>Under President Lula, Brazil has had some success reversing deforestation in recent years, but this year saw a sharp increase in the levels of destruction. The rising price of food is undoubtedly one of the major reasons for this, but Minc also stressed that it was down to a lack of inspection and enforcement of the law. </p> <p>Hackbart, however, blamed the \"economic model of agriculture\" as the main reason for the destruction. He said that Mato Grosso, one of the states bordering the Amazon, is \"a sea of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2003/dec/20/sciencenews.brazil\">soya</a> and cattle ranches.\" The big farmers are destroying the environment through the production of cash crops and cattle, he said, and pushing smaller farmers into the Amazon. He argued that the crisis needs to be tackled holistically and blaming Incra and the small farmers is to attack the principal victims of the crisis.</p> <p>Minc assumed office two months ago after the resignation of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/may/19/therainforestslastchance\">Marina Silva</a>, a native of the Amazon and an internationally respected campaigner. She had clashed repeatedly with other members of President Lula's government, in particular, Dilma Rousseff, Lula's chief of staff, who is leading its flagship programme for accelerated growth and Roberto Mangabeira Unger, the \"minister for long-term planning\". Although she was a long-time friend and colleague of Lula's, he also sided against her, stressing that the preservation of the Amazon should be \"balanced against economic development and the needs of the people who live there\".</p> <p>Silva had also come up against some entrenched vested interests at the local level and Minc again warned at the weekend that a lack of cooperation by some state governors was a major part of the problem. </p> <p>Brazil's environmentalists have repeatedly criticised <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blairo_Maggi\">Blairo Maggi</a>, the governor of Mato Grosso and the world's largest soya bean producer, for being one of the chief causes of the Amazon's destruction. Greenpeace awarded him their <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org/international/news/soya-king-wins-chainsaw\">Golden Chainsaw Award</a> in 2006.</p> <p>Five years ago Maggi told the new York Times:</p> <blockquote> <p>To me, a 40% increase in deforestation doesn't mean anything at all, and I don't feel the slightest guilt over what we are doing here. We're talking about an area larger than Europe that has barely been touched, so there is nothing at all to get worried about.</p> </blockquote>",

Aynsley-Green warned that many trusts still had \"some way to go\" to achieve this.</p> <p>\"Much still needs to be done to ensure young people placed on adult wards have the appropriate level of care and support they need.\"</p> <p>The commissioner's report, Pushed Into the Shadows, published in January 2007, criticised the \"national scandal\" whereby many children were being treated on adult psychiatric wards because of a shortage of beds.</p> <p>The follow-up study, Out of the Shadows?, carried out with the charity Young Minds, said progress was being made.</p> <p>The report found some young people had spent up to a year on adult wards.</p> <p>The study noted that in many cases little attempt was made to help children continue with their education with some being left to \"stare at the wall\".</p> <p>The Department of Health said an extra \u00a31.2bn for mental health services meant care was improving.</p> <p>A spokesman said: \"Spending on mental health services increased by 31%, or \u00a31.2bn, in the past five years, allowing the NHS to invest in the services and staff needed to transform mental health provision.</p> <p>\"This has included a commitment that, by November this year, no under-16 will be treated on an adult psychiatric ward and that by April 2010 all under-18s will be treated in an age-appropriate environment in hospital.</p> <p>\"We are confident that all trusts will meet these commitments on time, commissioning extra provision where required.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>Alan Clarke</strong> at <strong>BNP Paribas</strong> described the fall in the manufacturing CIPS survey as a \"very bad outcome given the extent of the fall so far and against the performance of the eurozone\". </p> <p>\"Very grim indeed,\" he judged. \"Manufacturing is clearly overshadowed by the services sector. Hence if we do see a repeat of today's dive in the services sector CIPS on Friday - and there is no reason why we shouldn't given the recent financial sector turmoil - then these surveys are going to be screaming recession and screaming for an imminent rate cut.\"</p> <p><strong>Paul Dales</strong> at <strong>Capital Economics</strong> said this morning's data on the manufacturing and services sectors \"provide the clearest signal yet that GDP contracted in the third quarter\". He said the manufacturing survey is roughly consistent with the official measure of manufacturing output falling by a whopping 7% a year compared to August's decline of 1.4%. </p> <p>\"Perhaps more worrying was the further weakening in the official measure of services output given that the services sector makes up 75% of overall GDP,\" he said. In the three months to July, services output was flat. Dales reckons that if services output were flat in August and September, this would be enough to reduce second-quarter GDP growth from zero to at least a fall of 0.1% in the third quarter. \"Overall, these figures bring the UK economy much closer to recession. We continue to think that GDP will fall by 0.2% next year.\" </p> <p><strong>Howard Archer</strong> at <strong>Global Insight</strong> described the manufacturing numbers as \"simply awful\". \"Wherever you look in the survey, there is serious weakness, with output, new orders, and backlogs of work all contracting at the fastest rate in the survey's history. </p> <p>\"There can be no doubt that manufacturing output contracted again in the third quarter after plunging 0.9% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter, thereby putting the sector in recession. Manufacturers are being hit hard by muted domestic demand, weakening activity in key export markets, elevated energy and commodity prices, and tight credit conditions. While the significantly weaker pound is providing a much-needed boost to UK manufacturers, this is being countered by weak domestic demand in key export markets, notably the eurozone and the US.\"</p> <p>He added: \"Evidence that markedly weaker manufacturing activity is starting to significantly dilute companies' pricing power boosts hopes that the Bank of England will feel able to cut interest rates from 5% to 4.75% as soon as next week to try and provide some support to the very weak and increasingly pressurized economy. The heightened financial sector turmoil and tighter credit conditions are significantly increasing the danger of a prolonged and deep downturn. If the MPC does not act next week, we expect a cut will only be delayed until November. Further out, we expect interest rates to come down to 3.25% next year.\"</p>",
  "<p>It probably hasn't escaped your notice that things are looking <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/creditcrunch\">distinctly shaky in money land</a>, and to quote the great Irving Berlin, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM_oku87vso\">There May Be Trouble Ahead</a>. </p> <p>Perhaps now is the time - while there is still an internet and we're not too busy putting our backs to the land growing potatoes - to rediscover some of the songs from the last Great Depression and speculate about the music that could see us through our own unfolding disaster.</p> <p>The most famous of all Depression era songs is Bing Crosby's<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eih67rlGNhU\">Brother Can You Spare a Dime?</a></p> <blockquote> <p>\"They used to tell me I was building a dream, and so I followed the mob,<br>When there was earth to plow, or guns to bear, I was always there right on the job.<br>They used to tell me I was building a dream, with peace and glory ahead,<br>Why should I be standing in line, just waiting for bread?\"</p> </blockquote> <p>(Improbably, George Michael has covered this song.)</p> <p>However, not all popular music from the era of poverty, mass unemployment, starvation, forced migration and hunger marches was this bleak - <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG-wjkB7gXM&amp;feature=related\">quite the opposite in fact</a>. </p> <p>Faced with a set of circumstances that were anathema to most people, the Great Depression provided an ideal environment for songwriters. The brief was simple: create magical little respites from the awfulness of reality, allowing people to laugh and dream. None of this existential angst and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xTTWHMCXdg\">keeping it real nonsense</a>. </p> <p>Of course, with the collapse of the economy (or as analysts were so recently calling it, the correction in the markets), there is almost certain to be a correction in pop music as well. For better or worse, many bands will go to the wall as the bubble bursts and public appetites change. Who do you think will survive and who will crash?

Photograph: C4</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They called him <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/04/22/news/profile.php\">St Jamie</a>. But it's gone way beyond that now. If by 2010 he is not also Lord Jamie, life peer and junior minister with responsibility for poor people's nosh at the <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/\">Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs</a> then the new Jamie Oliver show will have failed.</p> <p>There weren't a lot of recipes in it. He cooked some pancakes \u2013 egg, flour, milk - and showed some people who'd never cooked before how to do a spag bog with meatballs. But then <a href=\"http://www.jamiesministryoffood.com/content/c4/home.html?intcmp=homepage_flash\">Jamie's Ministry of Food</a> wasn't really for you or me. It was aimed straight at government, and all the busybodies who moan at the public to eat better, but don't do much about making it happen beyond spending taxpayer's cash on advertising. <br><br>It's called, pointedly, Jamie's Ministry of Food, but it is really Kitchen Nightmares writ very large indeed because the challenge is every kitchen in Rotherham, a town of a quarter of a million souls. Jamie's subjects are people who have never cooked at all. Like Natasha, a mum on benefits with two kids. Her five-year-old Kaya's favourite supper is a takeaway doner kebab. \"She's had two teeth out 'cause they've rotted,\" Natasha reports. So Jamie showed her how to cook a pancake.</p> <p>This teeters close to being the nastiest sort of human zoo TV. See the woman who eats 12 packets of crisps a day (and, it was implied, nothing else)! You can hear the southern fairies (Jamie's self-description) chorusing: \"Ohmigod, look at her, how stupid are they up there?\" But Jamie battles this. He keeps telling us how \"fucking angry\" he is about the state of affairs in the \"fattest region in England\", and he convinces you that Britain's bad eating problem is a national scandal (see <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2008/oct/01/foodanddrink.oliver\">Felicity Lawrence in today's G2</a> on food, class and poverty). And that it isn't the Rotherhamites fault. Just.</p> <p>You warm to him and his anger, though the analysis doesn't go much deeper than asking \"why didn't they learn how to cook from their mums?\" There is a yawning gap here. Where's the supermarkets' role in all this? 80% of food in Britain today comes from them, and you can bet that supermarket-pushed sugar-laden cereals and biscuits played their role in rotting Kaya's teeth. But Jamie got slapped on the wrist for criticising the Big Boxes when he did his <a href=\"http://www.jamieoliver.com/jamiesfowldinners/\">nasty chickens show</a>. Sainsbury's, with whom he has a relationship worth \u00a31m a year, were not pleased and they told him so (you can <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/video/2008/oct/01/advertising.oliver\">watch his latest TV ad for Sainsbury's here</a>).<br> <br>Finally we get to the let's-roll-our-sleeves-up-and-sort-this-out bit, Jamie's New Big Idea. It's quixotic and inspiring. And according to the press reports (well, here's <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/article1697450.ece\">this from the Sun</a>), it may be working. But from last night's first episode you cannot imagine Jamie's <a href=\"http://www.jamiesministryoffood.com/content/c4/pass-it-on.html\">viral cooking lessons notion</a> \u2013 whereby every newly trained family cook passes on their knowledge to four more, who in turn must pass it on to their own recruits - can ever take off. And what will the takeaways of Rotherham (presumably a fine and thriving industry) do if it does? </p> <p>So far, we've only met one person in Rotherham who can turn on a stove. She is Julie Critchlow, the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2006/sep/20/schoolmeals.schools\">leader among the mothers</a> caught by news cameras two years ago stuffing crisp packets and takeaway burgers through a Rotherham school fence to her children, starving under a new healthy-eating regime. At the time Jamie called her a \"big old scrubber\" but they make up. And it turns out she can roast pork belly, Chinese style. Hitched up, Jamie and Julie, are set to \"completely change the face of eating, living and shopping in Rotherham.\" That you'd like to see.</p> <p>Now can Word of Mouth please hear from the Rotherhamites who think that eating there has a grand face already. Or from those who not only know how to turn on the stove, but also how to make it sing (or at least produce a decent pot roast). Good luck to them. According to the <a href=\"http://www.which.co.uk/reviews/good-food-guide/\">Good Food Guide</a>, there are some quite decent restaurants not far away in Sheffield.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>\"It feels similar to when we made the breakthrough with Valencia. I could see the team improving, with better balance and a better mentality, and the confidence improved each year. Now I am looking at Liverpool in the same way.\"</strong> As hostages to fortune go, this is quite something, isn't it. Has Rafa jinxed his 250th game in charge with fancy chat?</p> <p><strong>Kick off:</strong> 7.45pm</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>It's nearly as you were with Rafa for three games in a row! Is he alright? Aurelio is the only change from the Stoke and Everton games, coming in for the hapless Dossena, with Mascherano still on the bench:</strong> Reina, Arbeloa, Skrtel, Carragher, Aurelio, Kuyt, Gerrard, Alonso, Riera, Torres, Keane.<br>Subs: Cavalieri, Dossena, Agger, Benayoun, Babel, Mascherano, Lucas.</p> <p><strong>So it's Riera v Kromkamp, then:</strong> Isaksson, Kromkamp, Simons, Marcellis, Salcido, Brechet, Mendez, Culina, Bakkal, Amrabat, Wuytens.<br>Subs: Cassio, Rodriguez, Zonneveld, Koevermans, Pieters, Nijland, Dzsudzsak.</p> <p><strong>A financial lawyer for a bank who may or may not have a massive cob on re the credit crunch:</strong> Felix Brych (Germany)</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Andreas Isaksson's last game on English soil:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/match/1061363\">Look!</a></p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>It's 7.42pm and the teams are on the pitch.</strong> You'll Never Walk Alone has been banged out, now it's the turn of the Uefa Champions League hymn, The Bastardisation Of Zadok The Priest. Everyone's shaking hands and smiling at each other, let's hope it doesn't degenerate into a massive fistfight before the end of the evening.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>And we're off!</strong> PSV haven't done their homework, because Liverpool kick off and are kicking towards the Anfield Road end in the first half. The home side ping it around for a minute or so, the away side chase around aimlessly. Nothing dramatic comes of it.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> Gerrard releases Torres down the right with a wonderful pass. Keane is waiting in the centre but Torres can't quite get his cross in. That's a corner. \"I suppose the draw with Stoke would be evidence for Rafa Benitez that Liverpool are closer to being a championship winning team,\" opines George Templeton, moving in slowly for the kill. \"The last few years, they would've figured out a way to lose that game at Anfield, kind of like what happened against Barnsley in the FA Cup last year.\"</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>4 min: GOAL!!! Liverpool 1-0 PSV.</strong> A very strange goal, this. Torres is found completely free eight yards out from the corner. He sidefoots powerfully towards the goal, but his effort is saved brilliantly by the feet of Isaksson. Kuyt picks up the rebound by the spot, shifts the ball right, and hammers it straight at the keeper. It's a poor effort - but it goes in. Beaten by the power of the strike, Isaksson pushes the ball into the right-hand corner. From the sublime to the ridiculous by Isaksson there, who has now conceded nine goals in his last 94 minutes on English soil.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> PSV have touched it a few times now, but they can't hold onto it.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> Liverpool have started very confidently here. Every man seems to want the ball. Arbeloa and Kuyt combine well down the right with a couple of quick one-twos; Keane is not far from latching onto the eventual through ball. This is very decent football from the home side.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>11 min:</strong> Liverpool are <em>very</em> comfortable here. Even the no-nonsense Skrtel is shaking his hips and sashaying down the wing like Garrincha, Amrabat playing the role of a traffic cone. <strong>Some People Are Never Happy dept.</strong> \"Not that I don't trust my beloved Rafa or anything,\" writes Louise Smith, \"but his sudden abandoning of rotation makes me a little nervous. I'm getting a vibe from him like he's just waiting for something terrible to happen so he can laugh in the faces of everyone who's blamed any little slip on rotation. Maybe I'm being too hard on him, this is what happens when I have to miss the match for work.\"</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>13 min:</strong> Maybe Louise Smith has a point: Amrabat springs the Liverpool backline with indecent ease to latch onto a through ball by Culina. He keeps the ball from going out for a goal kick, and only fails to lay a killer pass in the centre because no PSV player bothers to keep up with play.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> It's raining at Anfield, by the way. A lot.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>17 min:</strong> This is now more PSV than Liverpool, just. Bakkal nearly scoots free down the right but miscontrols the ball and the danger is over. Liverpool want to watch themselves at the back. \"The last time a Liverpool manager made such a bold claim as Rafa did today, Ged said we were ten games from greatness,\" notes a \"fretful\" Nick Smith. \"I'm not prone to looking on the dark side or owt.\" It's 18 years of angst we're dealing with here, remember.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>20 min:</strong> A fair penalty shout for Liverpool there: as Keane drags the ball from his right to left foot, his standing right peg is gently flicked by Salcido. He goes down and immediately claims for a spot kick. It isn't forthcoming, though, the referee possibly deciding that Keane was fishing for it, dangling his leg out coquettishly. PSV go down the other end, Amrabat having an Alonsoesque dig from 40 yards (it misses). \"I'm amused by the audacity of European companies in their habit of including their name in that of a football club,\" writes Gary Naylor, with reference to the P of PSV being Philips. \"I used to like Carl Zeiss Jena and who can forget Leigh Railway Mechanics Institute? As Liverpool co-owner Tom Hicks appears to own an Argentinian pet food company, will he re-name the Reds Pedigree Amigo Liverpool?\" What's wrong with a simple Weetabix Liverpool? Although in fairness that <em>would</em> be reasonably difficult to pronounce for those with a particularly thick local accent.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>24 min:</strong> Alonso, presumably piqued at Amrabat trying it on a couple of minutes ago, tries a 40-yarder of his own. He's equally unsuccessful.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>26 min:</strong> PSV have taken the wind out of Liverpool's sails here, without creating any particular chances themselves. Torres hasn't seen much of the ball so far. Then again Everton managed this on Saturday and look what happened then. Meanwhile John Kim has his own theory about Rafa's sudden eschewing of needless team rejigging: \"My guess is that Rafa's run through his yes-men assistant coaches, and that Sammy Lee has finally convinced him to stop with the ridiculous rotation.\"</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>29 min:</strong> Liverpool can't quite get it together at the moment. Kuyt waits for a dropping ball on the edge of the PSV area, but by the time he volleys it two men have closed him down and the effort is blocked. Here's Nathan Smith: \"What Louise (no relation) doesn't say is that Fergie is now rotating even more than usual, and will always be resting one of his striking quartet when fit. I'm awaiting the media backlash.\"</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>30 min:</strong> Torres gets on the end of another corner, and heads a dismal effort wide left from ten yards when the entire stadium expected him to at least hit the target.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>33 min: A GENUINELY WORLD-CLASS GOAL!!! Liverpool 2-0 PSV.</strong> This is fantastic. Kuyt adriotly beats two challenges in tight space down the right and springs Torres clear. Nando's first-time cross is whipped over towards Keane in the centre, and then it happens: Keane guides it into the bottom-left corner at pace, and then bedlam at Anfield. It sort of comes off his ankle - perhaps - but it doesn't really make much difference, it was steered in either way. Wonderful play by Liverpool there.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>37 min:</strong> Anfield is rocking at the moment. I'm not sure who's relieved more at Keane's first goal for the club: the player himself or the 40,000-odd cheering him on.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>41 min:</strong> Everyone suddenly seems to have given up on this game. PSV aren't pushing anyone forward to chase the game, while Liverpool are quite content to stroke it around. I hope it doesn't stay like this for the next 49 minutes. \"I hope that Gary Naylor realises that PSV is founded by Philips and that therefore it is not so strange that Philips is in their name. Even more Philips is also founded in Eindhoven. That's why Philips and PSV are so connected. Philips. So have I used the word Philips enough now? Good! My father works for them and hopefully this 'commercial stunt' will give him a pay-rise when he shows this MBM to his boss tomorrow.\" So writes Philip P Philips. Oh alright, it's Raymond Starke. If your dad gets a pay-rise as a result of this, Raymond, can you send me some free light bulbs, or whatever it is Philips makes, as a thank you?</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>44 min:</strong> Actually, hold on, Philips invented the CD player, didn't they? Why did I only ask for a couple of light bulbs? What was I <em>thinking</em>?</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>HALF TIME: Liverpool 1-0 Philips SV.</strong> That was a very easy half of football for Liverpool, who flew out of the traps at speed, then swanned around insouciantly for most of the half. Keane's goal really was a great effort, though, with Kuyt and Torres causing mayhem down the right. Rafa's 250th game is going perfectly to plan.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>Yes alright, what I meant was HALF TIME: Liverpool 2-0 Philips SV.</strong> \"More global economic woes, eh?\" quips Robi Polgar. \"Halftime score is now only 1-0? Look how fast the market plummets. The value of a goal just ain't what it used to be.\" OK, we're getting the wheels of industry turning again right here.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>And we're off again!</strong> Pieters comes on for Brechet. PSV pass it round for a bit. Liverpool seem quite happy to let them do it.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> Liverpool enjoy a couple of minutes of launching crosses into the Philips area from both wings. It's relentless - at one point Skrtel is the tricky winger on the left! - although it ultimately leads to nothing. \"My mate Dave Fenton,\" writes Shane, namedropping shamelessly as his mate Dave is the bloke who wrote top tugging song Turning Japanese by The Vapours, \"is married to a Phillips marketing wonk, aka Yugoslavian girl (hallo Branka!) who told us that Eindhoven was known as Vampireville because that's what the generous street lighting of the town made people look like.\"</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>51 min:</strong> Simons nearly releases Amrabat with a lovely raking 40-yard pass straight down the middle, but the lively PSV striker is just a tad offside. Nice football, though. \"Did it really take you three minutes to find out Phillips invented the CD player?\" asks Craig Kilgour. No. Well, might have done. OK, yes. \"Your google-fu is weak my child.\" You should see how long it takes me to find things out about Naim.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>54 min:</strong> Torres muscles Salcido out of it down the right, and is hacked down for his trouble. It's clumsy, not malicious, but Torres stays down worryingly for a minute or so. He gets up and hobbles about; I think he'll be OK.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>55 min:</strong> Yep, Torres is OK. He nearly tears free in the area, sprinting after a Gerrard through ball. Isaksson is out quickly to smother.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>58 min:</strong> Liverpool win a free kick wide left when Riera, who has been quiet tonight, is upended. Gerrard wastes it with a terrible delivery, sending it sailing straight over every outfield player's head and into the arms of Isaksson. \"Just how many bites would it take for Rafa Benitez to finish off that cake?\" wonders George Templeton, who really is spoiling for a fight tonight. \"Four? Six? Ten? We know he would never let the players near it. I think I will go for seven.\" That's not nice, George, Rafa is a very handsome man.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>59 min:</strong> Amrabat, who has been PSV's best player by far this evening, is allowed to advance towards the Liverpool area and unleash a low, hard shot which only just goes wide of the left-hand post. I think Reina had that covered, but it was close.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> Wuytens is replaced by PSV's leading scorer, Danny Koevermans.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>63 min:</strong> A great run from Arbeloa who allows Kuyt to pull two PSV players out right with his dummy run, then cuts inside. Amrabat drags him down. Aurelio's free kick is clever: he dummies, then whips it to Keane at the near post. Keane's flick across goal is just too high and strong for the men in the centre, but that was nicely worked.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> Torres leaps on a PSV backpass and so nearly scores Liverpool's third, his split-second effort from the inside-left channel across Isaksson just squirming wide right.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> To loud applause, Riera - who has clearly won the Kop over with his solid if as-yet unspectacular displays - runs off to be replaced by Benayoun. \"I'm surprised Gary Naylor hasn't mentioned Red Bull Salzburg,\" writes Eddie Robson. \"They were named after the carbonated 'energy' drink after the company bought Austria Salzburg. I thought they should have gone back to their 80s/90s name, Casino Salzburg, as that was one of the coolest names in world football. Red Bull also own the New York Red Bulls soccer team, but it sounds less ridiculous there because Americans call their sports teams silly names anyway.\"</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>70 min:</strong> Salcido and Amrabat combine well to set the former free down the left. His cross is deep and aimless, allowing Alonso to set Gerrard off on the counter. The captain should really have put Torres clear, but his pass is too strong, pushing the striker wide left and allowing him to be harried off the ball. That was a real opportunity for Liverpool to make it three.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>73 min:</strong> Koevermans fiddles around with the ball in the Liverpool area on the left and pulls it back to Bakkal, whose sidefooted effort is on target but hacked away. That was the best bit of football by the visitors all evening. \"Any truth in the rumour that PSV presented Liverpool players a set of Phillips anti-theft sensor lights to install before the away leg, in lieu of the usual pennant?\" wonders Justin Kavanagh.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>76 min:</strong> Marcellis is booked for dragging down Torres, 30 yards out. Lucas comes on for Keane. And then...</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>77 min: A MAJESTIC 100TH GOAL IN A LIVERPOOL SHIRT FOR STEVEN GERRARD! Liverpool 3-0 PSV.</strong> Gerrard cocks his leg back and fires a preposterously good shot straight into the top-left corner of the net. Isaksson had no chance whatsoever, that was travelling at a ridiculous velocity.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>78 min: GOAL! Liverpool 3-1 PSV.</strong> This was outrageously simple. Carragher misses a deep right-wing cross and the ball drops to Koevermans, who sidefoots into the bottom-right corner from eight yards out. Reina was completely stranded.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>81 min:</strong> Lucas has a swipe from 834 yards, but it is useless. Gerrard goes off, to be replaced by Babel, who has a half-decent record of scoring against PSV from his days in an Ajax shirt. \"Are American team names really any sillier than Sheffield Wednesday, Partick Thistle or Aston Villa?\" wonders Nathan Smith, not unreasonably. \"Surely naming a team after some kind of aggressive animal (Cougars, Bulls) makes more sense than a day of the week, a small prickly plant or a Roman dwelling?\"</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>84 min:</strong> So unlucky for Kuyt, who latches onto a clever through ball from Babel, keeps it in brilliantly to turn Simons, then falls over on the greasy surface in his attempt to send a quick cross into the centre. Meanwhile the US fightback continues apace. \"Regarding Eddie Robson's snide aside about American sports teams and their names, you English are a fine bunch to talk,\" writes Tracy Mohr. \"What the hell is a 'Latic', and what does it have to do with Wigan?\"</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>86 min:</strong> Babel has turned his ankle and is grasping the turf in some distress. He gets up and is going to be OK, I think, but he is hobbling around gingerly.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> Babel is fine - and should really have released Torres there, running into trouble needlessly. Then Alonso had a dig from 30 yards, but that was charged down. There will be three added minutes of this.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>90 min +1:</strong> Torres pulls the ball back from the byline out right for Lucas. The Brazilian's sidefoot was heading into the top-right corner but is, very unluckily, deflected away for a corner. From which Aurelio sees his dig charged down. \"At least our teams pass the Ronseal test by actually being FOOTball teams though eh?\" writes Matt Burgess. \"Though I suppose they had to find something to confuse trading standards as The Seattle OverPadded OverHyped Overarm Throwing Seahawks doesn't sound that marketable. Er, hang on...\"</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>FULL TIME: Liverpool 3-1 PSV.</strong> If anything, 3-1 flatters PSV. That was a very good performance by Liverpool, who - whisper it - are beginning to look the real deal. Meanwhile here's an answer to Tracy Mohr's query on 84 minutes: \"Everyone in the north knows that a Latic is what we ask for when we want a milky coffee,\" writes Dr. Ian Copestake, president of the William Carlos Williams Society.

  "<p>By this stage in the political-electoral cycle it would be reasonable to assume that a coherent international policy would be on offer from the Conservative party. Yet as ambassadors and international observers turn up in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/toryconference\">Birmingham</a> they will find prejudice in place of policy and a revival of the worst failures of both John Major's and Margaret Thatcher's foreign policy still embedded in Tory thinking.</p> <p>Compared to 1995 or 1996, when Tony Blair and Robin Cook had completely reshaped Labour's international rhetoric to ditch the Euroscepticism of the 1980s and the hostility to open trade of the Labour left as well as promoting a strong pro-American partnership, today's Tories have not the hard thinking about what to do if they take control of Britain's foreign policy.</p> <p>The latest example is the promise by David Cameron, repeated over the weekend by William Hague, to hold a <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4837174.ece\">referendum</a> on the all-but-defunct Lisbon treaty. The Irish no vote could in theory be overcome but even the most pro-EU of Irish observers think that if a second referendum were to be held the Irish no would be even stronger.</p> <p>In 2009, the EU presidency is held first by the Czech Republic then by Sweden. Neither Prague nor Stockholm have ratified the Lisbon treaty nor give much indication they will. Poland's president Kaczynski is also refusing to sign the treaty.</p> <p>Yet Cameron and Hague are insisting on a referendum on a dead parrot. Their cynical tactic is obvious \u2013 to corral the anti-European votes which might go to UKIP or the BNP. But to commit the first year of a putative Tory government to the passage of a referendum bill and then the organisation of a giant fiesta of anti-European hate in which the tabloids, the BNP, UKIP and the Better-Off-Out Tories can indulge into their xenophobic rhetoric seems an odd choice.</p> <p>The no camp will win but only to say no to what is not going to happen. Across Europe and in Washington, partners and allies will look aghast at the frivolity of Britain indulging in such pointless plebiscite politics. And since Cameron cannot deliver what UKIP, Open Europe and many of his MPs want \u2013 a withdrawal of Britain to the status of Norway outside the EU, he will just make Britain's look foolish as Sarkozy and Merkel and other serious centre-right leaders take over the leadership of Europe and marginalise Britain.</p> <p>Cameron's other major foreign policy speech was to denounce the politics of interventionism. The difficulties and controversy over Iraq are well known, but the major theatre of interventionism today is Afghanistan, where Britain and allies are trying to stop Taliban Islamist terrorists win power and in parallel move in for the ultimate al-Qaida and Islamist jihadi goal \u2013 control of Pakistan and a fundamentalist finger on Pakistan's nuclear button. Already the <a href=\"http://www.conservativemuslimforum.com/\">Conservative Muslim Forum</a> has called for support for Iran's drive to get nuclear weapons and has said a Tory government should lessen support for Israel. Is that Cameron's policy?</p> <p>The failure to intervene in the Balkans and Rwanda by John Major remains a blot on British foreign policy. A million asylum seekers left the former Yugoslavia because the Conservatives failed to stand up to and face down Milosevic. Not all interventions work but to rule out interventionism on principle, as Cameron appears to have done takes us back to the worst failures of recent Tory foreign policy.</p> <p>The small \"c\" conservative London establishment of ex-ambassadors are united in their view that Russia's invasion, occupation and dismemberment of Georgia has to be lived with and that, in the words of <a href=\"http://www.opendemocracy.net/Russia/article/Reading-Russia-Rewiring-the-West\">Roderic Lyne</a>, a former UK ambassador to Moscow, writing for OpenDemocracy, \"Nato enlargement has been a mistake from the beginning.\" This will strike a chill into the heart of the Poles and the Baltic States. It will also worry the Finns who are now looking seriously at Nato membership to gain extra security after Russia's military assault and establishment of military bases on Georgian territory. Finland, like Georgia won independence in 1918. Stalin snuffed out Georgia's freedom and Finland now worries that Russia wants to dictate the international relations of its close neighbours. David Cameron made a bellicose cold war speech in Tbilisi reminiscent of the more extravagant rightwing anti-Soviet rhetoric of the early Thatcher era but his policy of rejecting cooperation in the fraternity of centre-right governing parties in Europe runs counter to the accepted view that the best way to deal with Russia is to promote an integrated and united EU line on energy policy and on speaking as one to Putin.</p> <p>This week in Strasbourg at the autumn meeting of 600 MPs from 47 nations grouped in the Council of Europe, Cameron's foreign policy will come under pressure. Tory MPs have been backing the Kremlin's efforts to increase influence in Europe's human rights watchdog assembly. Earlier this year, Conservative MPs were promoting a former KGB staffer, now one of Putin's key aides in Russia's parliament, as president of the Council of Europe. Cameron's team back the Russian position on Kosovo against UK, American and EU policy. As with the odd pronouncements of the Conservative Muslim Forum it is not clear if Cameron and Hague actually know what Tory MPs and Peers get up to as representatives of their party at home and abroad.</p> <p>On transatlantic politics, Cameron, Hague and the Tory's defence spokesman, Liam Fox, appear determined to keep the spirit of Dick Cheney alive even as the Bush era becomes history. Both McCain and Obama have spoken of the need for partnership with Europe to tackle world instability. <a href=\"http://www.lordhowell.com/\">David Howell</a>, the Tory spokesman on foreign affairs in the Lords, and father-in-law of George Osborne, has spent the past 15 years writing that America is turning to Asia and is losing interest in Europe.</p> <p>Yet the opposite is the case. Whether on terrorism, on financial crises, on Afghanistan, on Turkey, on missile defence, on opening new bases in the Black Sea, we can see America is more involved with the wider Europe than ever before. When Nato was founded nearly 60 years ago, America worried about a small grouping of nations west of the Elbe. Now from the Caspian to the Atlantic, US interests are ever more co-mingled with Europe. To be sure, the rise of China and India herald a new future, but 60% of world GDP is concentrated in the Euroatlantic region and the Tory incantation that Europe does not matter any more make no sense in Washington or on Wall Street.</p> <p>Next year, the International Labour Organisation celebrates its 90th birthday. But the only available Tory policy on global social justice is the promise to take Britain out of its social charter obligations which have provided British workers with five week's paid holidays a year. As inequality rises to the top of the political agenda, Cameron wants to weaken such modest international work as it exists to promote social justice.</p> <p>The year 2009 also sees the 60th birthday of the Council of Europe which was brought into being by Winston Churchill's famous Zurich speech calling for European unity. Its most important achievement is the European convention on human rights and the setting up of the European court of human rights. But a number of senior Tories have called on Britain to withdraw from the ECHR with its obligation to accept refugees fleeing political and religious persecution. And Conservatives have never liked the rulings of the Council of Europe's human rights court banning violence against children (ie corporal punishment in schools) or upholding women's rights.</p> <p>Next year is also the 60th anniversary of Nato's founding. Today's Nato has to find a way of getting its European members more involved and more willing to share burdens and take risks. Cameron's hostility to European cooperation and party political partnership leaves Britain isolated and unable to influence the future direction of Nato, the EU and the Euroatlantic economic and security community.</p> <p>None of this will be debated at the Conservative conference in Birmingham. Never has a British political party prepared to ask voters to entrust it with government with such a wrongheaded foreign policy, which if implemented along the lines of current Tory rhetoric, would seriously Britain weaken.</p>",
  "<p>Rocked by the <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketturmoil\">credit meltdown</a>, London's financial heart isn't its only weak point. The capital is acutely vulnerable in terms of its food supplies. During the last fuel crisis, Sainsbury's chief executive, Justin King, warned the then prime minster, Tony Blair, that the country could run out of food in a mere three days if oil supplies continued to be interrupted. Yet, despite these warnings, and the now widely-accepted inevitable decline of cheap oil, the government has never taken the issue of the food security of London, or the UK, seriously. And nowhere in the UK is more vulnerable than our capital, which imports approximately 80% of its food.<br> Food in general travels much further today than ever before \u2013 between 1978 and 1999 \"food miles\" increased by 50% and now some 40% of all freight is related to food. Some 29% of the vegetables and 89% of the fruit we eat, for example, are imported. And in spite of organic food's environmental benefits at the point of production, over half of that consumed in the UK is currently imported (although this is declining as UK production capacity increases). According to the pressure group, <a href=\"http://www.sustainweb.org/\">Sustain</a>, one basket of imported organic produce could release as much CO2 as an average four-bedroom household does through cooking meals for eight months. The same would, of course, hold true for an identical basket of non-organic produce (and without the environmental benefits offered by organic production). <br> Some 95% of all the food consumed across the world involves oil at some point in its production \u2013 through the use of mechanised production, fertilisers, transportation and packaging. As global oil supplies diminish, so the threat to our overall food security increases. The globalisation of food chains make us vulnerable both to sudden interruptions in the supply chain, as well the spread of diseases such as bird flu. Both would be addressed by relocalising the growing of food, which would not only benefit health, but also strengthen communities which have lost touch with the very stuff of life \u2013 the food we need every day. How far could London go towards producing its own food? Assuming a catchment area of some 100 miles, the answer is a great deal. No one, at this moment, exactly knows how much, but the proposed creation of new <a href=\"http://www.lda.gov.uk/server/show/ConWebDoc.1343\">food hubs</a>, coupled with a determined effort to grow vegetables and food in London's already extensive (and largely unused) green spaces will hopefully see a dramatic alteration of the city's food security, an alteration which would also bring the cityscape to life.</p> <p>Our vulnerability to the threat of a serious food crisis cannot be ignored. For too many years we have left the means of supply and delivery of our most basic human needs entirely in the hands of free-market forces. This has proved disastrous to the health of the nation, it has added to rising concentrations of CO2 that threaten to trigger runaway climate change, and it has left us wide open to serious food shortages. Since the second world war, we have grubbed up 80% of our orchards, and it is now estimated that there are more people in prison than there are farmers left who could bail us out. Thus, not only do we need to re-skill people as gardeners, we also need to examine how we use the spaces in our cities to ensure that we have a chance of freeing ourselves from our current dependency on multinationals who have only their shareholders' interests at heart \u2013 not the most basic needs of a nation, and of a planet.</p> <p>As the financial hub of the city crumbles, we have to find a way to build a food system that will make us all the more resilient to future shocks; either to the climate, or to the financial system that is driving the climate beyond its limits.</p>",
  "<p></p> <p><strong>By Joseph Weisenthal</strong></p> <p>While we're on the subject of <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.org/entry/419-senate-passes-webcaster-act-now-onto-the-president-for-rubber-stamp/\">music royalty rates</a>\u2026 <strong>Apple</strong> (<a href=\"http://finance.paidcontent.org/paidcontent?Page=QUOTE&amp;Ticker=AAPL\">NSDQ: AAPL</a>) says it might pull the plug on its uber-popular <strong>iTunes store</strong> if the <strong><a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/crb/\">Copyright Royalty Board</a></strong> jacks up the amount it owes per track that it sells. Yep, the company made the \"don't come near me or I'll jump\" threat in a statement submitted to the board last year, now being reported by <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2008/09/30/technology/itunesthreat.fortune/\"><strong>Fortune's David Leonard</strong></a>. He notes that the CRB is set to resolve a price dispute between online music retailers and the <strong>National Music Publishers Association</strong>, which wants to collect 15 cents per track, up from 9 cents, currently. Apple, represented by the <strong>Digital Media Association</strong>, would actually like the rate lowered to 4.6 cents or 6 percent of \"applicable revenue.\"</p> <p>It's understandable that Apple would want to fight this\u2014based on analyst <strong>Gene Muster</strong>'s estimated 2.5 billion tracks sold in the coming year, the hike would cost it $144 million. But the notion that it would willingly give up its dominant position in online music retailing, as well as a key ingredient in what makes the iPod/iPhone franchise so successful, is basically implausible. Perhaps iTunes could go on, sans-music, but then its name would be absurd. If the worse came to worst, and the royalty rate were hiked and Apple could not stomach the $144 million hit to profit, then the company could always raise the cost of music. Apple argues that this would lower music sales\u2014thus obviating any gain to the publisher\u2014but for Apple, it would at least preserve the complementary store and device, which has brought the company such incredible fortune.</p> <p>For more skepticism that Apple would really shut down iTunes, <strong>Greg Sandoval</strong> at <strong><a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/cnet/20080930/tc_cnet/8301102331005502193\">CNET</a></strong> has a sharp take: \"I have to question why it has taken 18 months for Cue's comments to come to light, and why are they popping up just two days before the board is supposed to rule on a possible rate hike? Maybe it's coincidence. Or maybe Apple is firing a public-relations shot across the bow of the music industry and CRB. When it comes down mass appeal, Apple holds all the cards. If word gets out that music publishers is trying to stick it to consumers, and Apple is fighting to keep prices down on their behalf, well, there's liable to be public backlash against the labels. If this thing follows the normal course, there would be calls for boycotts, protests, and so on.\"</p> <p><strong>From <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.org/\">paidContent</a>:</strong><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.org/entry/419-lauren-rich-fine-hard-to-find-the-silver-lining-possibilities-include-b/\">Lauren Rich fine: hard to find the silver lining; possibilities include bankruptcies, funding woes</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.org/entry/419-netflix-adding-movies-from-starz/\">Netflix adding movies from Starz; live feed of channels too</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.org/entry/419-att-reorganizes-wireless-head-de-la-vega-now-oversees-all-consumer-serv/\">AT&amp;T reorganises; wireless head De La Vega now oversees all consumer services</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.org/entry/419-senate-passes-webcaster-act-now-onto-the-president-for-rubber-stamp/\">Senate passes webcaster act; now onto the President for approval</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.org/entry/419-rnwks-glaser-on-dueling-lawsuits/\">RealNetworks' Glaser on dueling lawsuits</a></p> <p><strong>From <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.co.uk\">paidContent:UK</a>:</strong><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.co.uk/entry/419-wpp-could-win-the-battle-for-tns-by-weeks-end-report/\">WPP could win the battle for TNS by week's end: report</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.co.uk/entry/419-industry-moves-bbcww-confirms-microsofts-dobson-to-run-global-ad-sales/\">Industry Moves: BBCWW confirms Microsoft's Dobson to run global ad sales</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.co.uk/entry/419-broadband-content-bits-kewego-clients-wizzard-on-joost-sky-itv-ads/\">Broadband Content Cits: Kewego clients, Wizzard on Joost, Sky ITV ads</a><br>\u2022<a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.co.uk/entry/419-itv-cutting-930-jobs-more-cuts-coming-from-technology/\">ITV cutting 1,000 jobs, more cuts coming from technology</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.co.uk/entry/419-earnings-game-racks-up-high-score-on-third-gen-success/\">Earnings: Game racks up high score on third-gen success</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.co.uk/entry/419-uk-round-up-all3media-on-joost-telegraph-on-blinkx-centaur-share-buybac/\">UK round-up: All3Media on Joost, Telegraph on Blinkx, Centaur share buyback, Orchard on WE7</a><br></p>",
  "<p>Virgin Mobile will today become the last of the six largest UK mobile phone operators to join the rush to connect consumers to the internet with the launch of its own mobile broadband package.</p> <p>The launch of the \u00a315-a-month service follows yesterday's news that more than a dozen mobile and IT companies had got together to push mobile broadband by creating laptop devices that would be able to connect to it \"out of the box\".</p> <p>Companies including Dell, Toshiba, Microsoft, Vodafone, T-Mobile and Ericsson combined with the mobile industry trade group GSM Association to create a mobile broadband service mark that can be put on any hardware able to access the mobile web immediately after purchase.</p> <p>The first notebook computers with mobile broadband inside will be ready to switch on and surf straight out of the box in 91 countries across the world in time for the festive season, backed by a $1bn (\u00a3562m) global advertising budget.</p> <p>The move is a direct attack on the rise of Wimax, a competing technology that has limited use in Europe but is being rolled out in a number of major US cities. </p> <p>It is a potential competitor to the next generation of mobile phone technology, called LTE. </p> <p>Wimax has also been backed by Google, which put $500m into a Wimax venture created by the US mobile phone company Sprint and a rival communications company, Clearwire, earlier this year. </p> <p>The search engine has already made another - albeit less powerful - wireless broadband service called wifi, free in its home town of Mountain View, California. </p> <p>More than 55 million people currently use mobile broadband services in 91 countries.</p> <p>Virgin, which uses the T-Mobile mobile phone network to run its service, will give its mobile broadband customers a free USB modem, which plugs into any laptop, and the ability to download up to three gigabytes of data a month if they are willing to spend \u00a315 a month for a year and a half. </p> <p>That is roughly equivalent to 2,000 emails or 100 hours of web surfing. Any consumer who uses more capacity - such as by downloading lengthy videos - will find themselves paying another \u00a315 per GB. </p> <p>The rise of mobile broadband services has raised concerns that mobile phone operators are facing serious congestion on their networks as more and more customers use them to spend hours online.</p>",
  "<p>We now have only 98 months before the world enters a new, more perilous phase of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/01/climatechange.scienceofclimatechange\">global warming</a>, and that's if we are lucky. Glaciers around the world may be increasing their rate of retreat, but something else is also beginning to move. When was the last time you can recall a former American vice-president calling on the youth of the world to commit widespread acts of civil disobedience?</p> <p>The Bush administration's ad hoc disregard of international law may be familiar, but the audience did a double take when <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSTRE48N78A20080924\">Al Gore</a>, speaking in New York in September, surprised the next generation by telling them to rip up the domestic rule book. </p> <p>He called it \"stock fraud\" when fossil fuel companies create the impression to potential investors that climate change shouldn't make them think twice before buying shares.</p> <p>\"I believe we have reached the stage,\" said Gore, \"where it is time for civil disobedience to prevent the construction of new coal plants that do not have carbon capture and sequestration.\"</p> <p>His comments followed the extraordinary emergence in the UK of case law that is beginning to legitimate previously illegal environmental direct action.</p> <p>Six Greenpeace campaigners were brought to trial last month facing damage claims. They climbed a chimney at the Kingsnorth coal-fired power station in an attempt to close it down (declaration of interest \u2013 I am on the board of Greenpeace UK), getting as far as daubing the word \"Gordon\" on the smokestack before an injunction stopped them finishing off with the words \"bin it\".</p> <p>But at the trial, the jury refused to convict them after hearing expert witness evidence on the threat of climate change. They accepted the \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/11/activists.kingsnorthclimatecamp\">lawful excuse</a>\" defence, which allows property to be damaged if it is done in the name of preventing damage to property elsewhere. </p> <p>The occasion was symbolic because Kingsnorth is the focus of a debate about whether or not the government will allow a new wave of coal-fired power stations. At the Labour party conference, the business secretary, John Hutton, scaremongered that Britain's lights would go out if they were not built. And in his keynote speech, the prime minister, Gordon Brown, called for a new generation of \"clean coal\" plants.</p> <p>Speaking almost simultaneously in the US, Al Gore stated explicitly: \"Clean coal does not exist.\" The energy cognoscenti will be aware that there is a term for one of the most polluting types of fossil fuel \u2013 it is \"brown coal\".</p> <p>But while one legal tide seemed to be turning last month, we discovered that another was rising in a far more worrying fashion.</p> <p>The biosphere \u2013 our oceans, forests, fields and atmosphere \u2013 is, in reality, the global economy's parent company. It can only produce so many resources and absorb so much waste each year. But, measured using the ecological footprint \u2013 a conservative assessment of our rates of consumption and waste production \u2013 since the mid-1980s, humanity has been overshooting available biocapacity, running up an ecological debt.</p> <p>Demand on nature's services is exceeding supply. Taking a typical calendar year, the date at which humanity goes into the environmental red has been creeping ever forward. Comparing like with like (the data sources and methodology are continually being improved), this year the world ran into ecological debt on September 23, five days earlier than last year. </p> <p>Considering that it took governments in the UK and US just a week to drop decades of hardened economic practice to save the financial system (a subsidiary of the environment) from meltdown, nationalising banks at great public expense, we should be asking why it takes any longer to act to save the planet from runaway warming.</p> <p>With talk of new runways and coal-fired power stations, the government is engaged in the environmental equivalent of promoting unguaranteed sub-prime mortgages with no credit checks and telling banks with no assets to keep lending. </p> <p>While the potentially irreversible environmental damage of such developments is familiar, the economic value is increasingly under question. Following doubts raised by voices as diverse as the former government chief scientific adviser, David King, and the Cooperative Bank, a new report last month called <a href=\"http://www.neweconomics.org/gen/z_sys_PublicationDetail.aspx?pid=261\">Plane Truths</a> from the World Development Movement and my own organisation, nef, questioned the economic value of aviation growth to both rich and poor countries alike. At least, reportedly, the cabinet ministers Hilary Benn and David Miliband are opposing new coal plants that are not capable of capturing and safely storing their own emissions. </p> <p>From overheated economies in meltdown, to an overheating planet with melting icecaps, it's now 98 months and counting \u2026</p>"
