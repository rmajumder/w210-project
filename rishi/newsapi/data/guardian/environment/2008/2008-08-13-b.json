  "<p><strong>This article contains material provided by Seb Schmoller and we should have acknowledged his contribution. He has written on the same subject on <a href=\"http://fm.schmoller.net/2008/04/what-to-advise.html\">schmoller.net</a></strong><br> Being a virtual student used to mean skipping lectures after you'd signed up. Now, it's about attending lectures halfway across the world via the internet, replaying lecturers' best bits over a podcast and using online discussion groups to mull over questions. Being virtual can require much more work than anything that happens in a real lecture theatre.</p> <p>First, though, you need the right kit. This means persuading proud relatives, or the bank manager, that the following are essential if you are to leave university with a good enough degree to secure a five-figure salary: a lightweight, web enabled laptop with a good protective case that doesn't look like a laptop case; a small printer to attach to it, and a headset so that you can conduct free internet calls and therefore be in constant contact with home/your financial advisor. Oh, and it should have a good recent graphic card to that you can connect to Second Life - not for gaming of course but so that you can take part in virtual seminars as an avatar.</p> <p>If you've got them to agree to all these with ease, you can add: a PDA with a calendar to keep track of study timetables and deadlines, and a keyboard for text messages so that you can discuss the latest reading lists with your peers and take notes on field trips. It will also help you contact taxis late at night so that you aren't forced to accept a lift from whoever you've just met in the bar. And, of course, you will be using it to keep in contact with home when unable to phone or email.</p> <p>Parents/overdraft still got some financial slack? Then an MP3 player will allow you to listen to downloaded audio files of lectures and learning materials on the way to seminars. That way you need never waste a moment of potential study time. Naturally, you may also need to download the odd music track to help relieve pre-exam stress.</p> <p>If you are studying science or medicine you'll easily be able to make the case for an MP4 player to allow you to download revision videos while travelling and remind you of procedures on your first clinical placement.</p> <p>The next step, once you've collected all this hardware, is to find out what to do with it. Sign up in the library for every training session going, particularly those on how to conduct online searches. Typing a term into Google and hoping for something vaguely relevant is not going to get you to the kind of original research material that will impress your tutor. Nor is relying on Wikipedia. So find out from Google Help about such canny tricks as putting quotes around search items, learn how to search within a particular website, and use Google Scholar to search the scholarly literature. <a href=\"http://intute.ac.uk\">Intute</a>, a free listing of high quality web resources for education and research, is worth a look, and don't forget to make use of all the add-ins available if you use Firefox as your browser.</p> <p>Don't feel you need to rely on your own university's virtual learning environment for course materials either. Check out the <a href=\"http://www.oercommons.org\">open educational resources</a> website and you can have free access to lectures, lesson plans, homework assignments and videoed lectures from institutions all over the world. Virtually, you can be learning all about Game Theory from academics at MIT, while physically studying fashion at Leeds Met.</p> <p>If you find you've spent so long browsing that you've missed Freshers' Week but can't remember any more about it than those who overdid the first night cocktails, you'll need to start organising your time online. Create an account on a bookmarking service such as <a href=\"http://delicious.com/\">del.icio.us</a> or <a href=\"http://www.connotea.org/\">Connotea</a> so that you can bookmark stuff for future reference, sign up for RSS feeds, and install Google Reader so you'll be notified when new content is published on your chosen sites.</p> <p>And geeks don't have to be lonely. Collaborating through Facebook groups, wikis, Google groups, discussion forums and blogs are useful ways of practising online etiquette, although always beware plagiarism, which doesn't count as showing teamworking skills. Try seeing if you can get hold of the same plagiarism software as your university to check that you don't, completely by accident, submit someone else's essay instead of your own.</p> <p>Friendly as you find your online community, it is also worth remembering that you can also find things out from real people, real books, and sometimes even real lectures.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Saturday October 25 2008 to acknowledge Seb Schmoller's contribution.</p>",
  "<h2>Chinese censorship</h2> <p>The Olympic Games have kicked off in China, and as the world turns its attention to Beijing, it's not just the sport that has come into focus (Chaos aims to crack China's wall, August 7). Along with China's pollution and political repression, its policies towards online freedom have also been put under the microscope. I was listening to the Guardian's excellent Tech Weekly podcast, which was discussing the so-called Great Firewall of China. What struck me most was how many parallels there are with what happens in China as there are with what goes on in the Middle East, and how much less global concern there seems to be about abuses of freedom in this part of the world. <br><a href=\"http://www.itp.net/blogs\">itp.net/blogs</a> </p> <p>The Chaos Computer Club are not hackers in the common sense of the term (think of them as \"good hackers\"). Rather, they are advocates of electronic privacy and freedom, and create some pretty useful and interesting software projects. Their latest is a damn fine one.<br><a href=\"http://borepatch.blogspot.com\">borepatch.blogspot.com</a> </p> <h2>Nintendocs</h2> <p>Assuming future studies make similar findings, the folks in Phoenix may have stumbled upon a way to save many lives (Why a Wii could be good for your health, August 7). Taking the idea step further, I wonder if it would be possible to use Nintendo Wiis to screen applicants to surgical programmes. According to a friend of mine who is a plastic surgeon, the current admissions process makes no consideration of a would-be surgeon's manual dexterity or grace under pressure before allowing him to train for surgery.<br><a href=\"http://techblog.dallasnews.com\">techblog.dallasnews.com </a> </p> <p>Apparently the Wii is good for something. I'm going to buy me one just so I can save on medical bills and do my own surgery on the family at home.<br><a href=\"http://www.lr50.spaces.live.com/blog\">lr50.spaces.live.com/blog</a> </p> <h2>Electricity not so dirty</h2> <p>I'm puzzled by the figures Prof John Miles gives in his letter of August 7. He estimates that power-station and transmission losses waste 80% of the energy input. But <a href=\"http://www-diva.eng.cam.ac.uk/energy/environmental/low_emissions.html\">Prof John Young and Dr Alex White</a> quote efficiency of \"just under 60%\" for combined gas-steam turbine generation. <a href=\"http://www.bit.ly/letters3\">Udo Kremer</a> agrees with them, and gives 43% efficiency even for power stations burning soft coal. As for transmission and distribution losses, these seem to be <a href=\"http://www.bit.ly/letters4\">less than 7.5%</a>. Combining these figures would indicate between 39% and 53% efficiency in the supply of electricity from a power station burning fossil fuel.<br></p> <h2>Stephen Earl, </h2>Oxford <p>What cloud-cuckooland does John Miles live in? An electric car uses only the same resources in its production as any other car. In its running, it uses no electricity from the national grid and emits no O2. So the argument simply does not hold water.<br></p> <h2>Chris Rigby, </h2>Devon <h2>No iPhone ire</h2> <p>Apple says that there are 100,000 SDK downloads for the phone. When I looked for the wave of anger Charles Arthur referred to I just couldn't find it (Apple is turning its friends into enemies, August 7). What I do see is a wave of software and the blogger comparing the phone unfavourably to a computer. Of course it is a computer, and of course it has much less functionality than OS X, but though a lot of the phone apps are a bit like widgets, they are multiplying apace. A lot of developers like Rogue - but also Omni, Novamind, Devon etc - are making good money out of the basic platform and some of them are already getting onto the phone.<br></p> <h2>Stephen Feber, </h2>via email <h2>Touch the future</h2> <p>With regards to your discussion on whether touchscreen technology will take over from the mouse (or keyboard), you did not even touch (excuse the pun) on the reason touch technology has became so popular (Touch takes hold, but it's no mouse-killer, July 24). This is simply down to the emergence of \"cheap\" multitouch displays. I agree when you say it is unlikely to overtake the keyboard, given you can already use your 10 fingers to work with a keyboard. This is why I see touch becoming a mouse-killer and not a keyboard-killer.<br></p> <h2>Michael Ruddy, </h2>via email <br>",
  "<p>Prince Charles should be brought back to earth (Charles warns GM farming will end in ecological disaster, August 13). He talks about \"genetic engineering ... [leading to] the biggest disaster environmentally of all time\". Bigger than the tsunami of 2004? Or global warming?</p> <p>I wonder if he is aware that the insulin produced by genetically engineered microorganisms has saved many millions of lives? And if genetic scientists finally succeed in growing blight-resistant potatoes, or rice with added vitamins, or maize or wheat which can thrive in drought or saline conditions, will he still insist that this is damaging \"food security\"? I doubt whether those for whom crop reliability is a matter of life and death would share his concerns. They may not care that biotechnology is \"experimenting with nature\".</p> <p>About six weeks ago the Joint Research Centre (the European Commission's scientific body) surveyed more than 400 Spanish farmers who grow Bt maize (the only crop allowed for cultivation in the EU), and reported that it produced higher yields and earned up to \u00a350 more per acre than conventional maize.</p> <p>Of course we should resist the Monsantos of this world, but we should also resist the bullying of those anti-GM campaigners who hinder scientific research by destroying GM crops. <br><strong>David Simmonds</strong><br>Epping, Essex</p> <p>Prince Charles' concerns over GM food are well-founded. Current genetics' methodologies are far from rigorous science and are more aligned to educated (albeit improving) guesswork. </p> <p>Most of genetic science is driven by those from the biological sciences. Hence, with a failure of the biology science world to police the application of such crude science practices, a world debate must be engaged that questions the quality of genetics as a true science. </p> <p>In a nutshell, the world is potentially a hundred years from a rigorous understanding of genetics and, critically, in the hands of biologists, we are now on the brink of devastating much of the earth's natural genetic pool through ignorance.<br><strong>Kevin Nolan</strong><br>Physicist, Institute of Technology, Tallaght, Dublin</p> <p>In his recent diatribe against genetic modification, Prince Charles is merely demonstrating anew his ignorance. </p> <p>The yields from organics being what they are, they couldn't sustain even a fraction of the earth's present population. As for \"going against nature\", not a single one of the grains we eat has much in common with the tiny, wild grass they were bred from. They have all been engineered for disease resistance and greater yield; we just have the ability to do it better now. If we are lucky, we may even manage the required improvements before poorer nations face mass starvation. <br><strong>Jonathan Trigell</strong><br>Hitchin, Hertfordshire</p>",
  "<p>Record numbers of A-level students will get straight As when their results arrive today, triggering the toughest ever competition for university places. </p> <p>Universities received the results of applicants on Sunday and one of the most senior admissions officers in England disclosed that more pupils were meeting their offers than in previous years.</p> <p>As more than 300,000 pupils find out their results today the number of top grades awarded is predicted to rise for the 17th year running. </p> <p>One in four entries will receive an A grade while the pass rate is expected to creep up beyond 97% for the first time, the 28th annual increase in a row. It will reignite the debate about standards as schools prepare for an overhaul of the A-levels from September in a bid to re-establish the faith of universities and employers in the qualification.</p> <p>The proportion of A-levels awarded an A grade has increased from 12% in 1990 to 25.3% last year. Alan Smithers, professor of education at Buckingham University, said: \"All the data predicts that the trend will continue and the A grade will go up by about one percentage point.\"</p> <p>Geoff Parks, head of admissions at Cambridge University, said: \"Fewer applicants have missed their offers; that implies results have gone up. The impression is we're seeing fewer Bs than last year so the number of As will have gone up a bit. There's a general sense of it being tougher than ever with a slightly lower rate of students turning down offers as well.\" </p> <p>He said it gave admissions tutors very little flexibility to consider pupils who miss their results tomorrow. \"It will give us no room for manoeuvre for people who have missed their results because of illness or family issues or other discretionary issues. </p> <p>\"We could be up for record numbers of student who get three As who are turned down. On that measure yes, it's tougher on the students.\"</p> <p>Competition in the clearing process will be harsher than ever as more students than ever achieve the grades demanded when they were offered a place. For those with lower than expected results, there will be fewer options than in previous years.</p> <p>Oxford reports that this year's grades are as good as last year when pressure for places meant they had to turn away 5,000 pupils who went on to get three As in their A-levels. Bristol and Manchester also reported the continuation of intense competition for places. </p> <p>Ministers attempted to head off complaints by universities about the knowledge and skills of A-level students by announcing plans to expand the number of pupils who undertake university-style dissertations in the form of an extended project while doing A-levels. </p> <p>Jim Knight, the schools ministers, said he hoped more schools would offer the essays, worth half an A-level. A pilot of the essays saw students investigate subjects including the impact of Asbos on behaviour, the effect of global warming on Inuit populations and whether the voting age should be lowered to 16. </p> <p>Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL), said: \"Extended projects are an excellent way to learn skills, and even better when a range of research and presentation methods can be used. But trying to graft them on to an already crowded and incompatible curriculum is not the answer.\" </p> <p>The Conservatives published research showing a stark geographical divide, with only 10% of 16 and 17 year olds in Sandwell, West Midlands, doing A-levels compared with 83% in Barnet, north London. Nick Gibb, shadow schools minister, said: \"People will be shocked to see there are areas of the country where fewer than one in eight children sit A-levels. As ever, it is the poorest areas that are worst affected.\"</p> <p>From September A-levels will be reformed into four more in-depth modules to replace the current six. There will be harder questions to test the top candidates which could result in a new A star grade, to be awarded for the first time in 2010. </p> <p>Last night headteachers argued that the continued rise in the pass rate was down to the hard work of pupils and their schools in response to pressure from the government to produce ever better results. </p> <p>John Dunford, general secretary of the Association of School and College leaders, said: \"People are getting better at the exams game. The government sets up a system and schools and colleges try to play that system. That's what they do. That's what independent schools have always been particularly good at.\"</p> <p>Anthony McClaran, chief executive of the university applications organisation UCAS said: \"As with every year some people will inevitably claim that A-levels are getting easier but we shouldn't really take away from the hard work of those students who have done well in their results today. </p> <p>\"It is difficult to compare the A-levels of today with those of 40 years ago as the world is quite a different place. Many world records are being broken at the Olympics but that doesn't make the feat easier or the distances shorter.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>Full coverage on the web from 7.45am <a href=\"http://www.educationtheguardian.com\">EducationGuardian.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Think back to June last year, when the vast organic food supermarket Whole Foods opened its first UK shop in London, and Britain seemed like a pretty different place. It was two months before the credit crunch bit, and organic food sales were rising each month, fuelled by consumers who had started to care where their food came from and how the way it was grown affected the environment. For some, eating organic had become almost a fashion statement; around the country, farmer's markets were a weekend ritual for eco-conscious shoppers, and expensive organic chains such as Fresh and Wild and Planet Organic were thriving in London and Bristol.</p> <p>\"We have skilled butchers, scratch bakers and even our own store artists! We have chefs, fishmongers, cheese artisans and team members handcrafting fresh foods right in front of our shoppers,\" read a Whole Foods press release, breathless with excitement. The chain believed it would change food shopping in the UK the way it had in the US. Words such as \"natural\" and \"organic\" would be top of every customer's shopping list, regardless of the high prices. </p> <p>How quickly times change. Last week, the company announced that its six UK stores, five of which operate under the Fresh and Wild label, had lost \u00a39m in a year and it was reconsidering its plan to roll out more stores across the UK. Shoppers complained that its food - six free range eggs for \u00a32.29, a loaf of bread for \u00a31.39 - was just too overpriced; \"I call it 'Far and Wide' on account of the number of items it seemingly gets from as far away from England as possible,\" says Matthew, who lives near the branch in Stoke Newington, north London. \"I grow my own vegetables so I know what's in season and I do get annoyed when they've flown in veg from other parts of the world. And its prices are absurdly high.\" Currently on sale at Fresh and Wild are organic kiwi fruit from New Zealand, at 79p each. </p> <p>Meanwhile Aldi, which has more than 300 stores across the UK and follows the pile it high, sell it cheap approach to food shopping (no \"cheese artisans\" here), says the number of its ABC1 customers (the middle classes, Whole Foods' target customers) has risen by 17% over the past year. And McDonald's is creating 4,000 jobs to cope with the increasing demand for cheap fast food. In the current climate, it looks like reckless spending to pay \u00a39 for an organic, free range chicken when the cost of everything else, from food basics to heating and water, is going up. Expensive, organic food is the middle-class indulgence that even the middle-classes can't seem to afford anymore. </p> <p>A report from PriceWaterhouse Coopers in May said that 48% of people wouldn't, or couldn't, pay a premium for organic or Fairtrade products. In another survey, 65% of people said they would buy more organic products if they were cheaper. But, according to the Soil A ssociation, the environmental charity that certifies 80% of organic produce, this isn't the whole picture. Annual sales of organic food grew by 26% from 1993 to 2006. This year, it is predicting a more modest 10% growth; but this still, it points out, outstrips the growth in non-organic food. And organic food will start to look more competitively priced as conventionally farmed food - hit by the rocketing cost of fertiliser, pesticides and supermarket distribution costs - becomes more expensive. </p> <p>Many organic farmers are also feeling the pinch - organic dairy farmers are warning that the increased cost of organic feed may put many out of business - but the squeeze on their livelihoods comes largely from the low prices paid by the supermarkets rather than a dip in demand from consumers. </p> <p>\"Perhaps it is inevitable that we might see some decline in demand among less deeply committed organic consumers, but this is more likely to be a plateau than a reverse,\" says Patrick Holden, director of the Soil Association. The market research group Mintel still predicts that by 2012 the organic market will have grown by 44%. </p> <p>What we are perhaps seeing is a change in the way people approach organic and sustainable eating, and shopping. A survey for Sainsbury's found that 62% of customers are concerned about wasted food and are more likely to use leftovers and cook food from scratch, rather than buy expensive, energy-intensive and over-packaged ready meals. </p> <p>Supermarkets such as Asda are stocking more free range and Freedom Food chicken, while Sainsbury's reported a 60% increase in sales of higher welfare chicken. </p> <p>While the overpriced organic stores may suffer from the credit crunch, smaller producers are reporting that their organic, locally sourced produce can actually save shoppers money. Last week, Riverford, which delivers 47,000 boxes of organic fruit and vegetables to households in the south-west of England every week, compared its prices with the equivalent organic vegetables from the supermarkets and found its box was cheaper. One of their boxes cost less than Tesco's non-organic equivalents. Growing your own is cheaper still. \"It doesn't make sense to cut back on what it is a very economical way of eating, especially on food where you know where it has come from and you can trust it,\" says Guy Watson, the farmer who founded Riverford. </p> <p>He expects growth of around 10% this year. It is, he admits, proving more difficult to get new customers but he believes this has more to do with the \"green\" claims of food manufacturers - most of which are rubbish, he says - meaning consumers believe there is more choice out there for sustainable, healthy food. \"We have enthusiastic customers and I don't think that when the bank statement arrives, they will take the organic veg box off their list. I am fundamentally optimistic\".</p> <h2>Pesticides alert </h2> <p><strong>What to eat if you want to avoid them</strong></p> <p>The Pesticide Action Network, a campaign group working to eliminate toxic pesticides, tested a range of fruit, vegetables and other foodstuffs for pesticide residues. Among the worst offenders were flour and bread, potatoes, apples, strawberries, pre-packed salads and tomatoes, so if you're concerned about pesticides, these are the products worth spending money on. Vegetables that didn't contain a residue included corn on the cob, cauliflower and marrow. A similar study by the Environmental Working Group concluded those with the least amount of detectable pesticides were onions, avocados, mangos, pineapples, and asparagus. It's also worth buying organic milk; several studies show it is higher in Omega 3 essential fatty acid, vitamins E and A, and one study showed a reduction in eczema and other allergies in children who drank organic milk.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Post questions and answers to Ask Leo The Guardian, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1 3ER <strong>Fax: 020-7713 4366</strong>.

  "<p>The Greeks, as we all know, used to compete in the original Olympic games stark naked and smothered in olive oil. That's no longer the fashion - because we have different cultural ideas about what parts of the body are suitable for public display - and, in fact, some women have taken the trend for Olympic modesty one stage further. This year, several women, including Egyptian fencer Shaimaa El Gammal and Bahraini sprinter Rakia Al Gassra, will be competing wearing the hijab. </p> <p>I suppose that as a good liberal feminist I ought to be appalled by this, seeing it as a symbol of patriarchal oppression. In fact, I find I rather admire these women. </p> <p>I am appalled by the fact that some countries, including Saudi Arabia, have sent male-only teams to the games. But for these women, combining their religious beliefs with their athletic ambitions, I have nothing but respect.</p> <p>A lot of rubbish is talked about the hijab. Since France banned girls from wearing them in schools in 2004, there has been a steady stream of media stories and comment suggesting that Britain should do the same. Feminist friends tell me that the headscarves are a symbol of female subjugation, a way to deal with male lust by forcing women to cover up, and that as such, they should not be tolerated in a gender-equal society. The women who wear them, they say, have been pressured into it by their communities. </p> <p>Well, yes and no. We all wear the kind of clothes we wear partly because of social pressure - and our own culture still says, for example, that it is more acceptable, and less sexual, for men to walk down the street topless than it is for women. Many patriarchal religions do indeed hold highly disturbing views about women, which should be challenged, but we should confront those ideas via education and debate, not by forcing young women to reveal parts of their bodies they would rather keep covered. If women say that they want to wear a headscarf, I'm afraid we have to take them at their word. What could be more anti-feminist than telling women that they don't really know what they think?</p> <p>Some might say that this is a matter of principle: removing religion from public life. That may well be a laudable aim, but if we want to pursue it we really ought to begin not by forcing schoolgirls to display their hair but by disestablishing the Church of England. In any case, surely the removal of religion from public life means that public bodies should have no religious preference, not that individuals should be banned from quietly practising their own faiths in public spaces.</p> <p>There is, in fact, a very easy test of whether a person's religious practices are unsuitable for a particular work or school environment: does that religious practice make it impossible for the person to fully carry out the function they are there for? As someone raised in the Orthodox Jewish tradition - which observes a strict sabbath every week from sunset on Friday to sunset on Saturday - it would be absurd for me to apply for a position, for example, reporting on the weekend club scene. If your religious beliefs mean that you consider abortion to be a sin, the field of gynaecology is not for you. If you hold strong convictions against gay marriage, you shouldn't apply for a job as a registrar. </p> <p>And if you wear a headscarf? Clearly you are not going to be suited for a job as a hairdresser's model, but - unless the material is so thick as to be soundproof - it will pose no difficulties in most jobs, or in the business of learning, which is what children attend school for. In fact, as the headscarf-wearing Olympic athletes show, there are almost no limits to your possible achievements. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Meanwhile, in other Olympic news, China is proving that you don't have to be a religious fundamentalist state to want to manage the way your girls and women appear to the world. It has emerged that Lin Miaoke, the nine-year-old in the red dress who sang Ode to the Motherland at the opening ceremony, was in fact lip-synching. The song had been recorded by a seven-year-old, Yang Peiyi, but her slightly uneven teeth meant that she was not considered cute enough to appear at the ceremony. </p> <p>We shouldn't be too surprised. Lip-synching has featured in modern music-making as we have become more and more image-obsessed and less willing to accept an ordinary-looking person making extraordinary music. Early 1990s band Milli Vanilli had their Grammy taken back when it was revealed they had been lip-synching their songs. Depressingly in Singin' in the Rain - a movie about the evils of lip-synching - several of Debbie Reynolds' ballads were sung by the lesser-known Betty Noyes.</p> <p>These days we are encouraged to compare ourselves with the stars of music, TV and film, and to feel like failures when we don't measure up. But even without lip-synching, every character we see on a screen is made up of the efforts of dozens of others, including writers, makeup artists, lighting technicians, wardrobe consultants, voice coaches and choreographers.</p> <p>I hope that authenticity is more appealing than super-human images. Perhaps Mamma Mia! has been such a success in the box office - if not with the critics - because it is obvious that the cast are singing their own songs, false notes and all. But in a world that places a huge and increasing emphasis on physical beauty, I can quite understand why some people might want to cover themselves up a little.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>This week Naomi visited the <strong>Hadrian exhibition</strong> at the British Museum: \"The beautiful statues of Antinous, Hadrian's male lover, are worth the trip by themselves.\" Naomi watched <strong>season one of The Wire</strong> much more quickly than she intended to, unable to stop: \"It's as good, and as addictive, as everyone says.\"</p>",
  "<p>It could be the stage set for a western. A rusting narrow gauge railway, its sleepers encrusted with sediment, twists its way into the mouth of a rough-hewn mine in a blank stretch of cliff. Inside, rusty wagons sit dead on the rails.</p> <p>This derelict goldmine under Beinn Chuirn 50 miles north of Glasgow could be revived this month when a diamond-tipped drill starts boring into its rocks, heralding a modern gold rush in the Scottish Highlands. An Australian-backed mining company believes there are deposits throughout the Grampian mountains.</p> <p>There are at least 4.5 tonnes of gold, at current prices worth roughly \u00a380m, buried in the 420m-year-old rocks at Cononish, a neat hill farm in a secluded, partially forested glen on the north-western corner of Loch Lomond national park, just west of the Stirlingshire village of Tyndrum.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336563692\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/8/14/1218702733051/tyndrumgraph.jpg\" alt=\"Tyndrum location graphic\" width=\"220\" height=\"260\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tyndrum could be home to \u00a385m of gold</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Inside the mine, Chris Sangster, a veteran mining engineer who has run vast mines in Africa and whose firm Scotgold bought Cononish last year, traces his finger along a pale band of quartz running like a spine down the mine. Buried within it are very fine particles of gold. </p> <p>\"It's a bit like the slice of ham in a vertical ham sandwich,\" he explained. \"We leave the white bread and take out the ham from the middle ... it's sort of a thin sliver running through the rock here. In a tonne of rock you will probably produce enough gold to make a normal style wedding band.\" </p> <p>The kilometre-long mine shaft was blasted into the mountain 20 years ago. Then the price of gold collapsed and with it, the original venture. But with global gold prices now about \u00a3400 an ounce, Cononish is back in favour and so too is gold prospecting across Britain.</p> <p><br>The Crown Estate, the state agency which owns nearly all the UK's gold and silver mining rights and levies a lucrative 4% of every mine's revenues, says the number of exploration licences it has issued has doubled in the past five years. There are now 17 in force in Northern Ireland - the site of Britain's largest gold mine at Cavanacaw, Co Tyrone; a further five in Scotland and four in Wales. Three of the Scottish licences are owned by Sangster's company.</p> <p>Once the drilling rig from Chile arrives in the next few days, Scotgold engineers will begin double-checking the scale of the find. They have been funded by Australian investors, who have sunk roughly \u00a32.5m of their savings and pension funds into the venture, after being told there could be gold across a 2,200 square kilometres stretch of the southern Highlands, from Glen Lyon in Perthshire down to the northern tip of Loch Lomond. </p> <p>\"This area is very prospective for gold,\" Sangster said. \"We've a number of occurrences that we know about at the moment and our exploration effort will be devoted to developing those and see whether those could be economic.\" </p> <p>Sangster believes that once Cononish begins production in 2010, it could kick-start a new trade in \"Scottish gold\" jewellery boutiques in nearby Tyndrum, perhaps rivalling the market in Welsh gold jewellery from the now defunct Gwynfynydd Mines Royal in Dolgellau and the Irish gold now being extracted in Omagh. </p> <p>But first, he faces stiff environmental tests. In the 23 years since it was discovered, Cononish has become part of the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs national park, founded in 2002, and a new European \"special area of conservation\". Cononish river flows into the river Tay, prized for its salmon fishing, wildlife and tourism.</p> <p>Tougher ecological and landscape protection laws policed by the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency and Scottish Natural Heritage are now in force, raising questions about whether a gold mine that will extract, crush and partly process half a million tonnes of rock on site, with millions of litres of mineral-rich run-off, is appropriate in a national park. </p> <p>Sangster wearily dismissed claims by critics that he could use mercury to separate the gold as nonsense, but says previous techniques using cyanide have been made redundant by new, non-harmful methods for separating the gold dust from the crushed rock, using gravity and flotation techniques. These techniques have also made gold recovery far more efficient and cheaper, a key factor in changing Cononish's viability.</p> <p>Sangster hopes to put its large rock-crushing mills inside the mountain and could also dump much of the resulting fine slurry and tailings in the mine. It seems likely commercial mining at Cononish will begin in 2010. Gordon Watson, director of planning for the national park, said Scotgold seemed to be serious about addressing the environmental concerns paramount for the park authorities. \"This isn't a wilderness type of park; it's a managed landscape,\" he said. \"Gold isn't something you find every day - we recognise the uniqueness of this - so we're certainly looking at it in as positive a way as we can.\"</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p>Unless <strong>Scotgold</strong> gets a move on with its mining project, it could find it suffers the same fate as 20 years ago, because the gold price - having risen this year to a <strong>27-year high</strong> - is falling. Gold prices soared until very recently as the dollar tumbled and inflation fears dominated world markets. Gold usually trades in the opposite direction to the dollar as it is seen as a <strong>hedge against weakness</strong> in the US currency. Speculators were also attracted to the precious metals markets as part of a wider bet on <strong>commodity prices</strong>. This heightened interest saw gold breach <strong>$1,000 a troy ounce</strong> in March, but prices have slipped as the dollar has recovered. The World Gold Council reported yesterday that demand for the yellow metal had dropped by <strong>19%</strong> in the second quarter as high and volatile prices had discouraged users - typically jewellery makers. Yesterday gold was trading at <strong>$820 </strong>an ounce.</p>",
  "<p>The first time I met my personal tutor, Angela Rowe, I burst into floods of tears. It was not an auspicious beginning. Bristol University makes it very clear throughout Freshers' Week what is expected of its new students: hard work, commitment and high standards. A combination of extraneous issues had left me feeling that starting a degree course as a mature student was going to be all too much. Luckily Angela was both reassuring and encouraging. </p> <p>Nearly a year on, the six of us \"matures\" who have worked our way through the first year of our psychology degree at Bristol have passed our exams, got our coursework in, been introduced to new concepts and skills, and come out alive at the other end. We have gone from being complete strangers to a close-knit and supportive little group. None of us knew what to expect back in October of last year: so, what's it like being a (relatively) ancient first year? </p> <p>The definition of a mature student is anyone who is aged 21 or over at the start of their course (over 20s in Scotland), so we are by no means geriatric. Only two of us, including me, are on the far side of 30. I'm nearly a year older than Angela, which I know because she invited us all to her birthday party. One of the perks of being a mature is that lecturers seem perfectly approachable human beings, though it's slightly disconcerting when a number look considerably younger than yourself. As matures, we are part of a growing band. The figures for 2006, when I was accepted, represented an 18% rise over the previous five years. In 2007, UK universities accepted 36,334 mature applicants aged 21-24. Of these, 29,343 were aged 25-39, and 8,320 aged over 40. </p> <p>We're a diverse bunch and have arrived here by a variety of routes. Dorota E Filipowicz, 27, has travelled from Gdansk. She downplays the difficulties of taking a degree in a language that isn't her first. \"I didn't have a clear image of what I was expecting, but it's very different from the Polish experience, much better organised. The best thing about the year has been thinking 'Wow, I'm doing this'. I feel my brain is working again.\" </p> <p>Nik Hubbard, 27, and Kanteba Gilling, 26, both gained their places after following an access course. \"I wanted to study psychology quite a while back, but I thought university wasn't for me,\" says Kanteba. \"I worked for a few years and had my child, but I was still thinking about it and I started with an Open University course. It was hard trying to work and study, and I felt if I was going to achieve, I needed the environment to do it, so I did the access course.\" </p> <p>Nik left school at 16. As he says, you're a different person when you're a teenager. \"I tried a college course then drifted along in loads of jobs. Then I suddenly thought my brain was rotting - the job I was in was not even the slightest challenge. So I decided to try and get into university.\" </p> <p>Alice Gibbs (\"you can just describe me as very mature\") is doing her degree purely for her own satisfaction. \"My children are all grown up, my business is ticking over nicely - and I want to do this for myself.\" </p> <p>Like me, Alison Wylie, 26, is taking her second degree: she already has a chemistry degree and a master's from Oxford. \"When I finished the course, I knew I didn't want to do anything related to chemistry. I had wanted to do a psychology A-level but I was the only one in the school. Within two months of starting an evening class in psychology, I knew I wanted to do a degree. I could see myself being interested in it all my life. The crucial difference now is that I'm doing this degree because I want to.\" </p> <p>Bristol groups its matures for tutorials, and Alison believes this is a big advantage. \"I was worried I would be older and 'different', but the other matures have the same other responsibilities and the same attitude to study, which is an enormous boost.\" It's been nice not to feel isolated, she says, especially as none of us live in halls of residence, which is where younger students tend to make friends and socialise.</p> <p>We've had the full academic experience, from lectures for several hundred to tutorials for six. In the first year, Bristol students also follow two \"open units\" on subjects not related to their degree, so between us we have clocked up extras as diverse as archaeology, Japanese and Hebrew. </p> <p>It's not all been plain sailing, however. I think we've all felt genuinely challenged by the academic work (don't ask me about my statistics grades). For Alice (who runs a care home) and myself, juggling work commitments has been an issue, though Dorota (who works as a nursing assistant) says study alongside work has been fine. </p> <p>Overall, first-year worries have dissipated and we're all looking forward. \"Give it a go,\" says Nik. \"Even if it's hard, it feels good when you find you can manage.\" </p> <p>Alison's advice to second-timers is to learn from the first time around. \"Think about what you liked and do it again, and learn from any mistakes, whether those might be choosing the wrong subject, not going to the right university, or not working hard enough.\"</p> <p>\"I would encourage anyone who wants to keep active post child-rearing to take up studies again,\" adds Alice. \"It's by no means easy, but this first year has shown me that with support and understanding from the tutor and peer group, those of us who have not studied for a long time can fall into the pattern of time management and stimulating work.\" </p> <p>All of us are hoping to pursue psychology further and Angela says this is typical of mature students. \"Mature students are more sure about their direction, and that brings dedication,\" she says. \"They often haven't done exams for a while and are less sure of their skills, but that pushes them to work harder.\" </p> <p>Angela has seen us all change over the year. \"When you arrived, there was a real sense of trepidation; 'Can we do this?' It's not always easy to make the transition to being a student but I think everyone has done really well.\"</p> <p>We all live in Bristol and will be meeting up over the long vacation. We regroup for the autumn term on September 29, and the second year, says Angela, will be a further challenge. \"But you'll all rise to it. It's lovely seeing mature students flourish - and surprise themselves.\"</p> <h2>A guide for the ... ahem ... more mature student</h2> <p><strong>Don't</strong> regress to your teenage years; 40 isn't 18, never has been, never will be</p> <p><strong>Don't</strong> ever say anything that has the whiff of \"I'm older and wiser\". No one will be impressed that you remember the days before email/the horse-drawn carriage </p> <p><strong>Do</strong> ask for technological help if you need it. You'll be working with the PowerPoint generation; they may find it hilarious that you've never met a memory stick, but they will be glad to help you out</p> <p><strong>Do</strong> enjoy the chance to interact with enthusiastic, intelligent young people: they are lovely!</p>",
  "<p>Russia's unjustified military action in Georgia, an EU and Nato aspirant state, provides the situation to judge whether the European Union has truly come of age and can punch its weight in the world. The suspension of EU-Russia negotiations on a new bilateral pact; freezing talks on visa-free travel for Russian citizens; and holding back EU humanitarian aid to Chechnya until Russia ends aggression in Georgia are three simple actions the EU can take. Once fighting dies down, the EU must also offer to send police to help keep the peace in Georgia's breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abhkazia and speed up free-trade and visa deals with Georgia and Ukraine, showing that those countries are not part of a grey zone for Russia to expand into.</p> <p>Russia's incursion into Georgia has thrown EU-Russia relations into turmoil in the gravest European security crisis since the 1999 Kosovo war. What is now required is for the EU to show that it has the strength and backbone to act and ensure that Russia does not get away with this naked aggression. In the early 1990s the EU let down the people of the Balkans as it stood by while the region tore itself apart, we cannot stand by and let this happen again.<br><strong>Alex Orr </strong><br>Edinburgh </p> <p>One of the arguments put by the Stop the War Coalition against the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan was that they would lead to ever more wars and global instability in which ordinary people would pay the price. The crisis in Georgia vindicates this argument. \"Georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity should be respected,\" thunders George Bush, the commander-in-chief of an army occupying the sovereign territory of Iraq and Afghanistan and openly preparing to make war on Iran.</p> <p>The same western leaders who earlier this year recognised the independence of Kosovo from Serbia are in no position to criticise Russia's involvement in South Ossetia. The US and UK drove a coach and horses through international law and cynically manipulated the UN - invoking it when it seemed to support their position, ignoring it when it didn't - to make war on Iraq. They mapped out the bloody path that Russia is following today. Who else will go down it tomorrow?<br><strong>Sasha Simic </strong><br>London </p> <p>The South Ossetian conflict raises, yet again, the need for a set of international rules to protect minority populations within states that overrides national sovereignty when those minorities are being abused. Such rules were being discussed as a consequence of the greater Serbian project and ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia, before they were spuriously used as one of the justifications for the war of aggression against Iraq. Even Russia must surely agree with this proposal now, given this accords with what it has said and done in South Ossetia. A political, diplomatic and legal template is far superior to rockets and war.<br><strong>Joe Murphy </strong><br>Manchester </p> <p>Simon Jenkins's suggestion that situations such as Zimbawbe or the Caucasus should be left to sort themselves out is a sad admission of defeat of liberal conscience (Comment, August 13). I agree President Bush is the last one entitled to lecture others on issues of intervention, and that realism in developing political relationships to prevent conflict is clearly needed. But the abuse of power under humanitarian pretext by the US and others does not make it less important for the world to take its responsibilities to protect people affected by widespread and systematic human rights abuses more seriously. Challenging outdated understandings of absolute state sovereignty, which reduce citizens to subjects of power politics, is essential in a world in which we share a common future.<br><strong>Michael Hammer </strong><br>Executive director, One World Trust </p> <p>\"What can have an impact on the Russians without damaging us more than them,\" asked one European official.

  "<h2>Couple charged with murder of girl, seven</h2> <p>The mother and stepfather of a seven-year-old girl who allegedly starved to death are to be charged with her murder, the Crown Prosecution Service said yesterday. A spokeswoman for the CPS said it had authorised West Midlands police to charge Junaid Abuhamza and Angela Gordon with the murder of Khyra Ishaq, who was found dead at her Birmingham home in May. Gordon, 33, and Abuhamza, 29, had been accused of \"causing or allowing\" the death of Khyra, who died after paramedics were called to her home in the early hours of May 17. Both face separate charges of cruelty to five other children.<br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Hope fades for boy, 14, missing after dive</h2> <p>A search for a 14-year-old boy who went missing while diving with his father was scaled down yesterday as rescuers lost hope of finding him alive. The pair, from South Wales, were diving from an inflatable boat. The boy vanished shortly after they resurfaced off Berry Head near Brixham, Devon. The rest of the diving party - the boy's mother, aunt and uncle - were unable to start the boat. Father and son trod water but the boy suddenly vanished. A rescue operation was launched on Tuesday afternoon. Rescuers were searching the beaches for a body yesterday. <br><strong>Steven Morris</strong></p> <h2>Variety and drama in ITV autumn schedule</h2> <p>ITV yesterday unveiled its autumn schedule, with Saturday night shows including old-style variety. New drama includes the thriller Children, with Sinead Michael as Emily (right). Football features heavily, marking the beginning of a \u00a3275m four-year deal with the FA. While ITV's ratings decline has slowed, the broadcaster - hit by a slump in advertising - desperately needs new hits. The autumn line-up is the first to be overseen by Peter Fincham, the former BBC1 controller, who will next week deliver the keynote MacTaggart lecture at the MediaGuardian Edinburgh International TV Festival.<br><strong>Owen Gibson</strong></p> <h2>Man held after 40-hour police siege with girl, six</h2> <p>A man was arrested yesterday after he barricaded himself and a six-year-old girl in a house for nearly 40 hours. Armed police were called to the address in the Eastfield area of Scarborough on Monday night after reports of a domestic disturbance. The 32-year-old man was taken into police custody for questioning. North Yorkshire police said the girl was taken to a place of safety. The man was named as Paul Eames. His parents, Margaret and David, made a television appeal for him to surrender. Det Chief Supt Steve Read, who coordinated the operation, praised officers for their professionalism.<br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Union sets dates for tube workers' strike action</h2> <p>Around 1,000 London Underground maintenance workers are to stage two 72-hour strikes in a dispute over pay and conditions, a leading union announced yesterday. Members of the RMT union at maintenance firm Tube Lines will walk out at noon on Wednesday and again from noon on September 3. Bob Crow, the union's general secretary, said Tube Lines employees did the same work as those on Metronet contracts but received \"an inferior deal on pay, pensions and conditions\". More than 700 RMT members working as cleaners on the tube are also going on strike in a separate row over pay. <br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Private funeral ceremony for shot honeymooners</h2> <p>Murdered honeymooners Ben and Catherine Mullany were buried in a private ceremony yesterday. The couple, from the Swansea valley, south Wales, were shot in a suspected bungled robbery at the Cocos Hotel on the Caribbean island of Antigua on July 27. In a statement issued through South Wales police, the couple's parents said: \"It was our wish that the burial was held in private and we thank the media for respecting our privacy.\" South Wales police has appointed family liaison officers for both families and has provided support to the murder investigation in Antigua. <br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Tesco records 40% drop in disposable bag use</h2> <p>The number of disposable plastic bags handed out to Tesco shoppers over the last month is 40% lower than for the same period two years ago, the retailer said yesterday. Customers have saved 2bn carrier bags since August 2006, according to the grocery giant. Tesco offers incentives for those who use recyclable bags through its in-store points card. Lucy Neville-Rolfe, Tesco's corporate and legal affairs director, said: \"We have helped our customers cut bag use by 40% without a bag tax adding to the cost of their weekly shop.\" The retailer said it had no plans to ban single-use bags.<br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Green leaflet leaves Birmingham red faced</h2> <p>Council officials in Birmingham yesterday admitted that 700,000 leaflets printed to promote recycling in the West Midlands city were emblazoned with a picture of Birmingham, Alabama, 4,000 miles away in the United States. The leaflets, costing \u00a316,000, provide details of what, where and when to recycle. Underneath the heading \"Thank You Birmingham!\" a photograph appears of a familiar skyline - but the famous Rotunda and BT Tower are missing. A city council spokeswoman said: \"We accept that the wrong photo was used but the detail contained in the leaflet is wholly correct.\"<br><strong>Damien Francis</strong></p> <h2>British trawler filmed dumping 80% of catch</h2> <p>A British trawler has sparked an international incident after being filmed taking a boatload of endangered fish caught in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea and then dumping the majority overboard in UK waters. Norwegian coastguards filmed the Prolific, a Shetland-based trawler, discarding more than 5,000kg of cod and other dead white fish, or nearly 80% of its catch. The incident took place on August 2 but the video only came to light yesterday. It is illegal to discard fish in Norwegian waters, but boats are forced to do so in EU waters if they have caught the wrong species or fish that are too small. <br><strong>John Vidal</strong></p>",

  "<p>As with their earlier site-specific productions, Birmingham Opera Company once again presents Mozart in an unusual venue, in this case a former rubber factory on an industrial estate. Following a preliminary priestly dance performed on a platform outside, the audience is herded into the main hall by threatening guards who place yellow, horse-shaped stickers on them that identify them as the dispossessed of the Trojan war. When the Cretan prince Idamante grants the Trojan prisoners their freedom, the attitude of the chorus - 170 local amateur singers and actors - changes, and they welcome the public as friends. Throughout the evening, the audience is drawn into events not just as passive onlookers but as mute participants. The experience is not always a comfortable one.</p> <p>Much about the way the venue is used proves fascinating. Inside the vast workspace, huge piles of soil have been built up as part of designer Stuart Nunn's overall scheme. The audience stands or sits on these to watch, shepherded from location to location by chorus members and even director Graham Vick himself. Orange trees symbolise the warmth and prosperity of the Cretan environment; bloodstained individuals in overalls - the sacrificial cult that underlies the local power structure - slice what looks like liver.</p> <p>The wider personality cult of King Idomeneo is represented in the Maoist costumes of the Cretans and their leader himself; in fact, there are more references to Mao here than there were in the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics. This weighty comparison falls uneasily on the shoulders of protagonist Paul Nilon, who seems far too amiable to be in charge of a repressive regime, and struggles to suggest the heroic tragedy of the individual whose self-serving vow of sacrifice comes back to haunt him and his people. Nilon does, however, make a strong showing with his virtuoso aria, Fuor del Mar. The remainder of the singing is decent to good, with Mark Wilde an articulate Idamante, and both Keel Watson and Andrew Clarke imposing as the Voice of Poseidon and the High Priest, respectively. Donna Bateman hurls herself fearlessly at the role of the vindictive Electra, even with a costume that suggests Imelda Marcos played by a drag artist.</p> <p>The musical coordination can be loose, despite consistent work from the orchestra under William Lacey, and much of the acting is broad brushstroke. But the show's strengths lie in community spirit and participation, and in these it easily succeeds.</p>",

  "<p>Sterling fell to its lowest level against the dollar in almost two years last night after the governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, warned that a \"difficult and painful\" period would bring the economy to a halt over the coming year.</p> <p>Despite predicting that inflation would continue to rise over the coming months to top 5%, the Bank's recession alert left the City convinced that the Bank would respond to the weakest growth since the early 1990s by cutting the cost of borrowing later this year or early in 2009.</p> <p>On the foreign exchanges, the pound dropped by more than three cents against the dollar and its value against a basket of global currencies dropped to its lowest level in more than 11 years in the wake of the Bank's forecast that a rapidly slowing economy and tumbling oil prices would see inflation drop back below its 2% target within two years.</p> <p>While most City economists believe that the Bank will wait until inflation has peaked before cutting the cost of borrowing from 5%, some believe that the threat of a looming recession could prompt a move as soon as next month.</p> <p>\"The real economic data is undeniable. The economy is slowing really sharply and to forecast inflation below target in two years' time was a huge signal,\" State Street strategist Lee Ferridge said. \"Will they cut [rates] next month? Well, you can't rule it out with the signal they have sent.\"</p> <p>King said that there was \"bound\" to be one or two quarters of falling output as the UK felt the full force of rising commodity prices and the year-long credit crunch, with living standards under severe pressure. The Bank believed that the collapse in housing starts to a postwar low could alone reduce growth by between a quarter and half a percentage point.</p> <p>\"Increases in food and energy bills will intensify the squeeze on real take-home pay which, for many households, is unlikely to grow this year,\" King said at a press conference for the Bank's quarterly inflation report. \"These are circumstances in which consumer spending and house prices are likely to weaken together.\"</p> <p>The governor added that the upward surge in inflation was more marked than the Bank had forecast three months ago, but insisted that the rise would be \"temporary\". The poorer outlook for inflation meant a \"more pronounced slowdown in activity is likely to be necessary to contain wage and price pressures and ensure inflation expectations are anchored in the medium term.\"</p> <p>The Bank's downbeat assessment was unwelcome news for the government as it seeks to restore its political fortunes, but although Threadneedle Street believes it will be 2010 before growth returns to its trend of 2.5%, King was given the full backing of the chancellor, Alistair Darling, yesterday. Darling said: \"As both the government and the Bank of England have recognised, the UK, like other economies, is seeing the consequences of globally high energy and food prices. We know the impact that this is having on people here and will continue to support families and business through these tougher times. But the fundamentals of the UK economy remain strong. The government stands behind the 2% inflation target, and will continue to support the Bank's decisions to ensure inflation comes back to target.\"</p> <p>However, the Bank's bleak predictions prompted criticism from opposition parties.

  "<p>The traditional picture of the British family spending its evenings slumped in front of the TV has changed dramatically, according to a new report from the watchdog Ofcom, published today. The box is still on, but the people on the sofa are talking on the phone, texting furiously or surfing the internet - increasingly using a laptop with a mobile broadband connection - while they keep one eye on the screen.</p> <p>Despite doomsayers who believe the web will eventually kill off TV, viewing has not yet collapsed. The average Briton spent 218 minutes - or over three and a half hours - a day watching television last year, two minutes more than in 2006 but down on 224 minutes in 2002. In comparison, the average internet user spent 24 minutes a day online when at home last year, up from just six minutes in 2002.</p> <p>But what has changed is that the TV no longer has the viewer's undivided attention, according to Ofcom's annual Communications Market report. Three quarters of 20- to 34-year-olds regularly use their mobile when in front of the TV, while more than a third of 25- to 44-year-olds often check the internet at the same time as watching a programme.</p> <p>Television is finding itself increasingly usurped among the young. While TV remains the \"media activity\" that British people above the age of 20 say they would miss most, 16- to 19-year-olds say it is a mobile phone they couldn't live without. </p> <p>The report shows the UK's continuing love affair with the mobile. More people send a text every day than access the internet and there are more phones in circulation than there are people in the UK. Nearly 60 billion text messages were sent last year - up 36% on 2006 - and mobile phone users talk on their phone for an average of 10 minutes a day, double the usage recorded in 2002.</p> <p>The mobile phone and other distractions mean young people are watching fewer TV shows, with 16- to 24-year-olds glued to the set for about 150 minutes a day in 2007, 10 minutes less than five years ago and more than an hour less than the UK average. People over 65, in contrast, spend five hours a day watching TV.</p> <p>Instead, younger people are spending more of their time online but with download and streaming services such as the BBC's iPlayer reporting record demand, many are merely choosing to watch their favourite TV programmes when they want by getting content from the web. Nearly a third of all internet users watched video clips and webcasts last year with the number of UK users of YouTube hitting 9 million this April alone - up 50% on a year before.</p> <p>Throwing off the shackles of the TV schedulers is not just the ambition of people with an internet connection. Almost a quarter of UK households - 6 million - had a digital video recorder by the end of last year, up 53% on 2006. DVRs allow people to store their favourite shows for viewing later. Their success is bad news for advertisers who use commercial television to get in front of a mass audience. Of those with a digital recorder, 88% always skip past the ads, according to Ofcom.</p> <p>But when they do watch \"traditional\" television, the taste of 16- to 24-year-olds is remarkably similar to that of those over 65. Both like entertainment and contemporary music shows while 16- to 24-year- olds watch slightly more soap operas and factual programmes than people over 65. The big difference between the age groups, according to the report, is in the area of news and weather programming.</p> <p>Among those over 65, TV news and weather programmes account for 14% of all viewing, compared to just 7% of all viewing by 16- to 24-year-olds.</p> <p>The Ofcom report shows that online advertising hit \u00a32.8bn last year, up 40%, and eclipsing spending on the traditional terrestrial channels ITV1, Channel 4, S4C and Five for the first time. Given how much more time people spend watching TV than using the internet the figures look incongruous, but the Ofcom report does not take into account the amount of time British consumers spend online at work.</p> <p>In fact, take-up of residential internet services is slowing as the digital divide between rich and poor becomes ever more obvious. Most households that have a computer are already online with PC penetration running at 72% in the UK and internet penetration close behind at 67%. Broadband take-up - at 58% of UK households - has slowed not least because younger consumers such as students are opting to buy mobile phone \"dongles\" that give internet access and are often cheaper than a lengthy broadband contract. Over 2 million Britons now use mobile internet services, with sales of dongles nearly doubling between February and June this year to over 130,000 a month.</p> <h2>Why we should turn off our electrical appliances</h2> <p>British households are wasting the annual output of a large power station by failing to switch off their flatscreen televisions, set-top boxes, and internet networks when they are not being used, according to Ofcom's latest Communications Market report.</p> <p>The equivalent output of the 1,500MW Didcot B power station in Oxfordshire could be saved each year if every home with a set-top box switched it off at night; that would conserve enough electricity to make 80bn cups of tea.</p> <p>Consumer electronics account for about a third of home energy use, according to the Energy Saving Trust, but that use is forecast to balloon to 45% by 2020 as more people buy more gadgets.</p> <p>The rise in average residential energy bills to just over \u00a31,000 a year has made people more energy aware, but only when it comes to buying obviously power-hungry devices such as fridges and freezers, according to Ofcom.</p> <p>Almost three quarters of Britons, when quizzed by the regulator, classed themselves as caring about the environment, and more than half said they had compared the green credentials of white goods before making a purchase. But only 39% of people think about the environmental impact of a new TV, DVD player or computer. </p> <p>When they get it home, meanwhile, most people leave their new kit switched on all the time, unnecessarily wasting electricity. </p> <p>Three quarters of people rarely switch off their set-top box, according to Ofcom, and that figure jumps to 83% for owners of a wireless home network. Plasma screens are particularly power hungry, according to the regulator, with the average set using three times the power of a normal TV when in use, and twice the power when left on standby. </p> <p>The average satellite set-top box gobbles up four and a half times the power of a flatscreen LCD television in the same state. Even a Freeview box uses twice the power of a flatscreen TV when left on standby.</p> <p>Almost half the country's mobile phone users, meanwhile, waste electricity by charging their handsets overnight, when in fact most models only need to be plugged in for about two hours. People aged between 16 to 24 are particularly guilty of this, with 80% doing it at least some of the time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336574942\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2008/08/13/14.08.08.Ofcom.gif\" alt=\"Ofcom charts\" width=\"462\" height=\"802\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Saturday August 23 2008.

  "<h2>Halls of residence, Clough Hall, Edge Hill University</h2> <p><strong>Leanne Watson, 23 </strong><br><strong>BA (Hons) Dance</strong><br><strong>Home town: Hull</strong></p> <p>I've had a brilliant year in halls, but I'm looking forward to having more privacy when I move into a shared house next term. I worked for five years before coming to university. When you've been working and living in your own place it can be hard to adjust to communal living. There are 24 of us on the corridor, and we get along brilliantly, but there are always going to be niggles. </p> <p>The bathrooms aren't very clean. That's boys for you! There are five showers, but only one power shower, which everyone squabbles over. The boys' toilet isn't very nice. There is wee all round it. Some people take ages in the bath, Pete for one. I've no idea what he's doing in there ...</p> <p>The kitchen is OK, but some people leave their washing-up for days. I don't mind people using my stuff as long as they wash it afterwards. There's often mouldy food in the fridge. I'm as guilty as anyone - I've had a cheese and coleslaw salad in there for two weeks now. It's grown skin and hair and everything. </p> <p>Sometimes the boys will come in after a night out and be quite loud, which can be a bit annoying if you've got a 9am lecture the next day. A few months ago, they put a dartboard up at the end of the corridor. They'll come back at 1am and start a darts competition. You ask them to be quiet and they're fine about it, but then they start again. There's no bad feeling, though. It's all good-humoured. </p> <p><strong>John Kelly, 25</strong><br><strong>(Bsc) Sports and exercise science</strong><br><strong>Home town: Liverpool</strong></p> <p>This is my third year in halls. I tried a shared house in my second year, but it wasn't sociable enough for me. I now get paid around \u00a3200 a month for being a student adviser. Officially, I'm supposed to work seven hours a week, but it usually ends up being more.</p> <p>I like to think of myself as a big brother figure. I get woken up by people who've forgotten their keys or had a bit too much to drink and want to talk. We sometimes have trouble with people from other halls - or sometimes not from the university at all - trying to get in at night, so I have to deal with that.</p> <p>People come to me about everything, from their money worries to boyfriend and girlfriend troubles. The first term is particularly busy. I try to organise loads of social events to help people settle in, but people do get homesick. </p> <p>The halls have been updated since I started university. It used to feel like a hospital: lino floors and bare white walls. Now there are carpets in every room it's far more welcoming. The plumbing is still old though, so the showers aren't the best. The bathrooms aren't exactly filthy, but some people are inconsiderate. The girls are the worst actually. They leave hair in the plughole.</p> <p>We've got lockers in the kitchen, but there are still squabbles over food. I've drawn a line on my milk carton before so I can tell if people have nicked any from the fridge. Some people even scrawl swear words on their milk cartons, but people still help themselves.</p> <p>It's great not having to worry about cooking, but some of the food could be improved. But the staff are friendly and the lasagne takes some beating. </p> <p><strong>Pete Moss, 22</strong><br><strong>BA (Hons) Coach education and participation development </strong><br><strong>Home town: Lincoln</strong></p> <p>Freshers' week was brilliant. It was just one big party. We went and bought a load of buckets from Morrisons and filled them up with homemade punch. We did think about using the bath, but that would be a bit unhygienic, wouldn't it? I'm fairly easygoing, so there isn't much that gets to me. The toilets and bathrooms are nice and clean. What does annoy me is when people leave water on the bathroom floor. You walk in your socks and they get all wet. </p> <p>I've never really noticed anyone being particularly noisy, but that's probably because I'm one of the ones being lairy! </p> <p>Living in halls is such a good laugh. I'm moving into a shared house next year, but I don't really want to. There are only going to be five of us, which isn't going to be as much fun. Here, there's always someone around to talk to, any time of day or night. </p> <p><strong>Matt O'Neill, 19</strong><br><strong>BA (Hons) History</strong><br><strong>Home town: Sunderland </strong></p> <p>I've only been at Edge Hill for just over a term. I transferred from York St John. </p> <p>The halls are really sociable here. It's reasonably clean, but with 24 people on this corridor, there's bound to be more mess. Wednesday and Sundays are the big nights out, so there can be a bit of a queue for the shower. People do bicker about it, but it's generally good-humoured. </p> <p>It can be a bit noisy at night, which can be a bit annoying. But I knew it would be like that in halls, so it doesn't bother me too much. </p> <p>Next year I'm going into a shared house with four other lads, including my brother. I'm really looking forward to that. It will be really nice to have a room where you can sit and watch telly instead of sitting in each other's room. </p> <h2>Shared house, Lincoln University</h2> <p><strong>Lauren Slater, 20</strong><br><strong>BA (Hons) Drama</strong><br><strong>Home town: Leamington Spa</strong></p> <p>The house is Victorian and terraced. It's very long, with very little light, so it can feel quite gloomy. I thought my room was grim at first, but I've grown to love it. It's quite small, with this awful woodchip wallpaper and has a nasty grey carpet which runs through the house. </p> <p>With six of us using it, the kitchen can get pretty disgusting. I chucked out a bowl of tuna mayonnaise from the fridge today. It was completely green. A couple of weeks ago I was in the shower when the water started rising up around my ankles. The plughole was clogged with blond hair. I was almost retching. </p> <p>Sadie uses her floor as a wardrobe. Lucy is the one who has her essays done well before the deadline and sorts out all the paperwork for the house, but her room is a tip. We call her bed \"The Bin\". You never know what might be lurking. I once found a fork in a plastic bag in there. Another time, I sat on a drawing pin. </p> <p>Meg tried to deny she was a chav for the first few months, but now she just admits it. She does the chav look: Fred Perry tops, trackie bottoms, massive gold earrings and permanent fake tan. And she's always got 50 Cent or Justin Timberlake blasting out of her room. </p> <p>Sadie's music is worse. She listens to Al Green, Abba and Phil Collins. We call her the crooner. She sings along to everything, knows the words to absolutely every song you could possibly think of. It's a good job she's got a nice singing voice, otherwise we'd have killed her by now. </p> <p>I guess the others probably think I'm dramatic. I often get texts from the others late at night asking me to \"shut up and go to bed\".</p> <p><strong>Lucy Tant, 21</strong><br><strong>BA (Hons) Journalism</strong><br><strong>Home town: Exmouth</strong></p> <p>After living in halls last year, I couldn't wait to move into a house. My room had breeze block walls, like a prison cell.</p> <p>There are six of us in the house and we pay \u00a3263 a month. The four of us have a right laugh together. We don't see much of our other two housemates. One is really nice, but spends a lot of time in Nottingham, where her boyfriend is studying. We had a big bust up with the other one. We've barely spoken since Christmas.</p> <p>My room isn't much better than last year's. It's quite big, but has this mint-green stucco wallpaper. It backs on to the downstairs bathroom. Sometimes I come in and it smells of cat pee. I bought a plug-in air freshener but it hasn't made much difference. </p> <p>We don't really argue, but when you're sharing a place, there are obviously going to be things you find irritating. The tumble dryer is incredibly noisy and is right outside my door. People do have a habit of using it in the middle of the night. </p> <p><strong>Meg Lindow, 20</strong><br><strong>BA (Hons) Media production</strong><br><strong>Home town: Hull</strong></p> <p>I got last pick, but I think I've got one of the best rooms. I've got a big bedroom on the ground floor. I'm not keen on the lilac walls, though. We've got two bathrooms between the six of us, but we all miss the ensuite bathrooms we had in halls.</p> <p>I really liked the kitchen-cum-living room when we came to look round the house. Now I wish they were separate. There's always someone bashing around in the kitchen when you're watching telly. </p> <p>We bicker, but we're tight as a group. I can't think of three girls I'd rather live with. We've all got part-time jobs, so we get plenty of space from one another. We don't see much of the other two. </p> <p>Lucy is the organised one. She found us the house and takes on the mother role, but her room is a tip. Lauren is the little one with the big mouth. </p> <p>Sadie spends a ridiculous amount of time in the bathroom and plays terrible music. She's just bought some new speakers and I keep getting woken up in the morning by Phil Collins. She blames it on her iTunes shuffle. I mean, what kind of 20-year-old girl listens to Phil Collins? The others all call me a chav because I like dance music. </p> <p>When you live with friends, you have to be open about things like sex. The walls are pretty thin. We've all heard things we'd rather not hear. It's big joke between us now. </p> <p>The four of us have got a house for next year. We're all looking forward to that. </p> <p><strong>Sadie Geoghegan, 21</strong><br><strong>BA (Hons) Journalism</strong><br><strong>Home town: Market Harborough</strong></p> <p>I couldn't wait to get out of halls last year. There were stains on the carpets. The firedoor had graffiti all over it. Worst of all, I moved in and found a bird's nest on top of the wardrobe and bird poo all over the walls. </p> <p>The first thing we did when we moved in was buy some throws for the sofas. The cushions are quite tatty, too. The landlord keeps asking us to sew them up! We use them as dinner trays. I'm not sure how much the rent is. My parents pay it. A few times we've had to phone up the landlord because the internet or telly has stopped working. </p> <p>The four of us get on pretty well. We shop and cook together. We split the cost four ways, but we're all allowed one luxury item that no one is allowed to touch. The deal is that whoever hasn't cooked washes up, but it doesn't always happen. Sometimes the washing up is touching the ceiling. </p> <p>With six of us living here, we do generate a lot of rubbish. You're not allowed to overfill wheelie bins around here. The bin collection is on Friday, so we often creep out late on Thursday night and empty our rubbish into our neighbours' bins. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>For more on accommodation, go to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/studenthousing\">theguardian.com/education/studenthousing</a></p> <h2>Housing tips</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Most universities offer first-year students accommodation in a hall of residence on or near the campus.

  "<p>Merrill Lynch yesterday forecast that banks still need to raise \u00a330bn in new capital to repair balance sheets shredded by the credit crunch and will be forced to write off a further \u00a320bn in \"toxic\" assets. </p> <p>Barclays and HBOS are the UK banks most likely to require fresh capital, it said, warning that bank stocks are likely to retrench over the next two months.</p> <p>Shares in UK banks have staged a remarkable comeback since the lows hit in mid-July, with RBS up 40%, Barclays ahead 37% and HSBC up 35%. In the US, the gains have been even more pronounced. </p> <p>The parallel fall in the oil price since mid-July peak of $147 to $111 yesterday has led traders to suggest that the long-oil, short-banks trade that has been the dominant strategy for speculators during the credit crunch has now unwound.</p> <p>Merrill Lynch's monthly survey of fund managers, published yesterday, shows that asset management groups have reduced their overweights in oil and gas and are cutting back their underweight position on banks and financials. But it believes fund managers are moving too quickly to unwind their positions.</p> <p>\"One consequence of the recent fall in the oil price has been a rapid unwinding of what the survey has highlighted as a highly crowded trade: investors have reduced 'long' or overweight positions in energy and started closing underweight positions in financials. But have they lost sight of the fundamentals?\"</p> <p>Merrill Lynch believes that the crude oil price will return to $119 over the fourth quarter and will remain above $100 throughout 2009.</p> <p>Stuart Graham, the head of Merrill Lynch's European bank equity research said that hopes that the credit crunch may be easing are misplaced. \"The banks are looking no better than fair value [at current share prices]. They are about 80% through the write-down of toxic assets such as sub-prime loans. So far they have taken a $140bn (\u00a370bn) hit but there's probably a further $40bn to come. </p> <p>\"On re-capitalisations, they have so far raised $120bn in fresh equity, but [European banks] need another $70-$120bn. UK banks most likely to need to raise capital are Barclays and HBOS.\" </p> <p>The closely followed Merrill Lynch survey, which collates the views of fund managers in charge of more than \u00a3300bn in assets, found inflation fears had receded sharply. The June survey found that a net 33% of managers expected global inflation to rise, but by July this had turned into a net 18% believing that inflation will fall.</p>",
  "<p>Better than nothing. That is the absolute cheeriest thing that can be said about the Bank of England's growth forecasts yesterday. A statistical cigarette paper is all that now separates the economy from outright contraction over the coming year. The central projection was for national income to grow by a fraction of 1%, and in turbulent times such numbers oscillate wildly. Although bank governor Mervyn King was characteristically calm in giving his grim forebodings, he did not disguise the reality that there is now a strong possibility of recession. With new unemployment figures, also out yesterday, suggesting the tally was rising more rapidly than for years, the well-worn talk about a slowdown is giving way to the realisation that the economy has juddered to a halt.</p> <p>In simpler times the Bank would be reaching for its financial jump-leads - cutting interest rates in the hope of persuading firms and homebuyers to spend more. The times, however, are complicated by resurgent inflation. Just a day before Mr King gave his verdict, official figures had confirmed what shoppers already knew, that price rises are gathering pace. At more than double the Bank's 2% target, Tuesday's figure of 4.4% was quite bad enough. Mr King, however, signalled yesterday that big heating bill increases already in the gas pipeline would soon push it the wrong side of 5%. Next month the governor will be picking up his pen to explain himself in an open letter to the chancellor, as he is obliged to do on a quarterly basis whenever living costs rise by more than 3%. Never an easy letter to write, if the bank was seen to be emphasising expansionary action over price stability, it could become plain awkward.</p> <p>Awkward but appropriate. The Bank is not charged with targeting inflation next month, but inflation in two years' time. The slowdown will reduce it by then, as will the recent fall in global commodity prices - it may not have registered on the forecourts yet, but the price of a barrel of crude is down $30 from its July peak. So, the Bank's best guess is that by summer 2010 inflation will be more or less on target. What holds it back from rate cuts is fear the inflationary contagion will spread from the shops to pay packets, and then run out of control. </p> <p>When central bankers wake in a cold sweat at night, they imagine some spectral unionist cackling \"I'm alright Jack\" after winning an unaffordable rise. One unionist, Paul Kenny of the GMB, popped up this week to stoke the nightmare by saying that higher wages had become \"inevitable\". But the reincarnation of Red Robbo looks decidedly unlikely in the light of yesterday's earnings data. While inflation has waxed, pay rises have waned - the average increase in the year to June being just 3.4%. In public, private, manufacturing and service sectors the downward trend was the same. The Treasury, it seems, is having some success in bearing down on the public wage bill. And in the private sector, four workers in five do not have a union to argue for inflation-busting rises.</p> <p>If wages remain sluggish, the case for a rate cut will soon become unanswerable. The Bank remains nervous, but at least has the prospect that its dilemma will thus ease. No such luck for ministers, who will find no comfort at all in Mr King's suggestion that the \"squeeze on real take-home pay\" will soon intensify. For Gordon Brown, in particular, the worry is voters will now turn even more violently on the man who once led them to believe that he had abolished boom and bust. He must show struggling families that he is on their side, but his options are limited as the slowdown is hitting the government's already-battered books. The scant funds available must be channelled into assistance with heating, and targeted help with mortgages for those in danger of repossession. It will not be easy to afford such a package. But what the government can afford even less is to stand idly by and leave vulnerable people to struggle alone as the big squeeze takes hold.</p>",

  "<p>The English language has come a long way since Samuel Johnson published his influential Dictionary of the English Language in 1755, defining such words as kickshaw, or \"a dish so changed by the cookery that it can scarcely be known\". What he would have made of electrosmog and wardrobe malfunction is anyone's guess.</p> <p>The words are to be included in a new edition of the Chambers Dictionary, which features hundreds of new words and phrases in common usage.</p> <p>Wardrobe malfunction, as suffered by TV presenter Judy Finnigan, who accidentally exposed her bra during an award ceremony in 2000, describes the temporary failure of an item of clothing to cover a part of the body that it would be advisable to keep covered. Electrosmog is not the latest dance move but electromagnetic fields emitted by computers, mobile phones and other devices believed by some to be harmful. Mary O'Neill, editor in chief, said: \"The new words paint a vivid picture of current interests. Social trends and preoccupations, such as the environment, have come through - words like food miles and carbon footprints.\"</p> <p>Although words may have been in circulation for some time, O'Neill said they were only included in the dictionary once they were deemed to be lasting. \"We've been watching words like Wag [a wife or girlfriend of a professional sportsman] for a long time but we don't want words that are ephemeral or just the buzz words of the moment.\"</p>",
  "<p>No sane person wants to see more nuclear weapons in the world. They cause horrible destruction. The world needs to find a way to reduce the reliance on these weapons by existing nuclear states, be it by Britain and the United States or by Israel and India. Recent columns in these pages by George Monbiot and John Pilger acknowledged this, but dangerously underplayed the gravest threat to the global effort to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons: Iran. </p> <p>We equally need to press Tehran about its nuclear programme, and challenge its disdain for international inspections and for the United Nations. Pilger suggests that concerns about the programme are largely a matter of \"disinformation ... from a discredited CIA-sponsored Iranian opposition group\". No government on the UN security council agrees with him; it adopted three resolutions ordering Iran to suspend its dangerous nuclear and missile programmes without a single dissenting vote. </p> <p>Britain, France and Germany stepped forward in 2003 to take charge of the Iranian nuclear file. In 2005 Europe, with Britain in the lead, persuaded the Bush administration to set aside its deep concerns and to let the Europeans lead. Between 2006 and 2008, Europe orchestrated a series of security council resolutions about Iran. Under Javier Solana's leadership, Europe has put together a consortium of six great powers - Russia, China and the US, along with Britain, France and Germany - to negotiate with Iran. What an opportunity for Europe to show that it can take on the global leadership role it so craves. Instead, European leaders have had to swallow the bitter pill of admitting that they are making little, if any, progress.</p> <p>The obvious temptation is to look for a scapegoat. Now the US has shown that it fully endorses the European-led effort, blaming the Bush administration is less plausible. In this context, periodic rumours fly that Israel may soon strike Iran's nuclear facilities. The likelihood of such a strike any time soon remains small for the simple reason that Israel has much to lose from acting, unless in desperate straits. An Israeli strike would convert a global issue about Iran's failure to comply with its obligations under international treaties into a bilateral Israeli-Iranian issue on which many around the world would side against Israel.</p> <p>Pilger suggests we confront \"the real threat [that] remains almost unmentionable in western establishment circles and therefore in the media\": namely, Israel's nuclear weapons. Before asking why Israel insists on keeping its nuclear arms, he might ask exactly what threat causes Britain to keep such weapons. Israel has to worry about radicals, from Iran to Gaza, who reject its right to exist. Faced with a much less ominous Warsaw pact, Britain insisted on the right to keep many hundreds of nuclear weapons. </p> <p>That said, it is not surprising that Israel is more favourably disposed toward preventive action than any other country is. After all, Israel is the country most at risk from a nuclear Iran. Israelis see a nuclear Iran as an existential threat, due to the possibility of nuclear terrorism, the potential for miscalculation in a crisis, or the prospect that an irresponsible or fanatical Iranian leader might be tempted to use Iran's nuclear arsenal to expunge Israel from the region. </p> <p>The challenge facing the international community - the challenge on which Europe has claimed the leadership - is to persuade Iran to step back from the nuclear brink. Diplomacy is more likely to be effective if it is reinforced by sticks and carrots. Besides its key role in the European-led diplomacy, Britain could do much on its own to reinforce the actions of its European partners to press Iran until it agrees to compromise. The City of London's importance as a hub for international finance means that warnings from the British government regarding the risks of doing business with Iranian institutions could appreciably increase the pressure on Tehran.</p> <p>If Iran were in effect locked out of the world's two largest financial centres, New York and London, even hardline Iranian leaders might reflect on the high cost of their refusal to compromise. British authorities need not take formal action; they have long been skilled in the art of passing quiet messages to business leaders.</p> <p>Scapegoating Israel sidesteps the issue. Instead, those worried about what Israel might do should take steps to address the security concerns that led Israel to conduct its recent military exercises designed to show that it could strike Iran if need be. Not only Israel but Britain and the whole world will be safer if together we can reduce the threat of the proliferation of nuclear weapons by reinforcing respect for the UN and international inspections.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>Patrick Clawson is the deputy director for research at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy <a href=\"www.washingtoninstitute.org\">www.washingtoninstitute.org</a></p>",
  "<p>The outcome of six grim days of bloodshed in the Caucasus has triggered an outpouring of the most nauseating hypocrisy from western politicians and their captive media. As talking heads thundered against Russian imperialism and brutal disproportionality, US vice-president Dick Cheney, faithfully echoed by Gordon Brown and David Miliband, declared that \"Russian aggression must not go unanswered\". George Bush denounced Russia for having \"invaded a sovereign neighbouring state\" and threatening \"a democratic government\". Such an action, he insisted, \"is unacceptable in the 21st century\".</p> <p>Could these by any chance be the leaders of the same governments that in 2003 invaded and occupied - along with Georgia, as luck would have it - the sovereign state of Iraq on a false pretext at the cost of hundreds of thousands of lives? Or even the two governments that blocked a ceasefire in the summer of 2006 as Israel pulverised Lebanon's infrastructure and killed more than a thousand civilians in retaliation for the capture or killing of five soldiers?</p> <p>You'd be hard put to recall after all the fury over Russian aggression that it was actually Georgia that began the war last Thursday with an all-out attack on South Ossetia to \"restore constitutional order\" - in other words, rule over an area it has never controlled since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Nor, amid the outrage at Russian bombardments, have there been much more than the briefest references to the atrocities committed by Georgian forces against citizens it claims as its own in South Ossetia's capital Tskhinvali. Several hundred civilians were killed there by Georgian troops last week, along with Russian soldiers operating under a 1990s peace agreement: \"I saw a Georgian soldier throw a grenade into a basement full of women and children,\" one Tskhinvali resident, Saramat Tskhovredov, told reporters on Tuesday.</p> <p>Might it be because Georgia is what Jim Murphy, Britain's minister for Europe, called a \"small beautiful democracy\". Well it's certainly small and beautiful, but both the current president, Mikheil Saakashvili, and his predecessor came to power in western-backed coups, the most recent prettified as a \"Rose revolution\". Saakashvili was then initially rubber-stamped into office with 96% of the vote before establishing what the International Crisis Group recently described as an \"increasingly authoritarian\" government, violently cracking down on opposition dissent and independent media last November. \"Democratic\" simply seems to mean \"pro-western\" in these cases.</p> <p>The long-running dispute over South Ossetia - as well as Abkhazia, the other contested region of Georgia - is the inevitable consequence of the breakup of the Soviet Union. As in the case of Yugoslavia, minorities who were happy enough to live on either side of an internal boundary that made little difference to their lives feel quite differently when they find themselves on the wrong side of an international state border. </p> <p>Such problems would be hard enough to settle through negotiation in any circumstances. But add in the tireless US promotion of Georgia as a pro-western, anti-Russian forward base in the region, its efforts to bring Georgia into Nato, the routing of a key Caspian oil pipeline through its territory aimed at weakening Russia's control of energy supplies, and the US-sponsored recognition of the independence of Kosovo - whose status Russia had explicitly linked to that of South Ossetia and Abkhazia - and conflict was only a matter of time. </p> <p>The CIA has in fact been closely involved in Georgia since the Soviet collapse. But under the Bush administration, Georgia has become a fully fledged US satellite. Georgia's forces are armed and trained by the US and Israel. It has the third-largest military contingent in Iraq - hence the US need to airlift 800 of them back to fight the Russians at the weekend. Saakashvili's links with the neoconservatives in Washington are particularly close: the lobbying firm headed by US Republican candidate John McCain's top foreign policy adviser, Randy Scheunemann, has been paid nearly $900,000 by the Georgian government since 2004.</p> <p>But underlying the conflict of the past week has also been the Bush administration's wider, explicit determination to enforce US global hegemony and prevent any regional challenge, particularly from a resurgent Russia. That aim was first spelled out when Cheney was defence secretary under Bush's father, but its full impact has only been felt as Russia has begun to recover from the disintegration of the 1990s. </p> <p>Over the past decade, Nato's relentless eastward expansion has brought the western military alliance hard up against Russia's borders and deep into former Soviet territory. American military bases have spread across eastern Europe and central Asia, as the US has helped install one anti-Russian client government after another through a series of colour-coded revolutions. Now the Bush administration is preparing to site a missile defence system in eastern Europe transparently targeted at Russia.</p> <p>By any sensible reckoning, this is not a story of Russian aggression, but of US imperial expansion and ever tighter encirclement of Russia by a potentially hostile power. That a stronger Russia has now used the South Ossetian imbroglio to put a check on that expansion should hardly come as a surprise. What is harder to work out is why Saakashvili launched last week's attack and whether he was given any encouragement by his friends in Washington.</p> <p>If so, it has spectacularly backfired, at savage human cost. And despite Bush's attempts to talk tough yesterday, the war has also exposed the limits of US power in the region. As long as Georgia proper's independence is respected - best protected by opting for neutrality - that should be no bad thing. Unipolar domination of the world has squeezed the space for genuine self-determination and the return of some counterweight has to be welcome. But the process of adjustment also brings huge dangers. If Georgia had been a member of Nato, this week's conflict would have risked a far sharper escalation. That would be even more obvious in the case of Ukraine - which yesterday gave a warning of the potential for future confrontation when its pro-western president threatened to restrict the movement of Russian ships in and out of their Crimean base in Sevastopol. As great power conflict returns, South Ossetia is likely to be only a taste of things to come. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:s.milne@theguardian.com\">s.milne@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>David Miliband demonstrated a touching taste for modern diplomatic alphabet soup when he headed off this morning to discuss the Georgia crisis with fellow European foreign ministers. He declared to the BBC that Nato, the EU, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and UN were the means for delivering a just and stable solution to the latest gunfight in the Caucasus.</p> <p>This is worrying. All four organisations have a strong record on delivery falling far short of their rhetoric \u2013 most particularly so in the case of Nato and the OSCE. It was feared that when Nato expanded into eastern Europe after the end of the cold war, it was offering a promissory note it stood no chance of redeeming, particularly in the case of the Baltic states which were the most eager applicants to join the alliance.</p> <p>Like it or not, the alliance always hinged on article five of its <a href=\"http://www.nato.int/docu/basictxt/treaty.htm\">founding treaty</a>, and it still does. This is the clause that could have been written by Dumas' Three Musketeers. It says, essentially: \"All for one and one for all\". This is the bit that clearly attracts leaders like Mikheil Saakashvili, the Georgian president, to the club. France for one, and the UK not far behind, believe that both Georgia and Ukraine should be admitted to full membership. If they really mean it, we can expect a lot more stormy weather in the east. A spokesman for the French foreign ministry said, in the past 48 hours, that \"the door for Georgian membership of Nato remains firmly ajar.\"</p> <p>Article five has been invoked fully only once in the history of the alliance, and in all nearly twice. It was invoked in the aftermath of 9/11 as a response to an attack by a \"foreign power\" on US domestic sovereign territory. There was also serious debate about whether the article should have been invoked if Saddam's forces crossed into Turkey during the Kuwait invasion crisis of 1990-1991.</p> <p>Imagine Georgia had been a member of Nato when the present <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/georgia\">crisis</a> began, or even a serious candidate member. If article five's request for immediate military support had been invoked, less than half a dozen of the existing membership could have done anything at all. The US is so badly overcommitted in Iraq and Afghanistan that it could only move minimal forces at short notice. Of the European allies, only the UK and France have the vestiges of an expeditionary capability, and most of that is used up already in Iraq and Afghanistan in the case of Britain, and Afghanistan, Lebanon and Africa in the case of France.</p> <p>The Georgia crisis should be a much needed reality check for Nato, and not an occasion for militaristic bluster. It is time for its member governments to reflect on what the alliance is for, and what it can really do. It should not be a diplomatic bulldozer for corralling Russia along the eastern marches of Europe. For this reason, among others, Ukraine and Georgia should not be given Nato membership, but some other security guarantee in which Nato and Russia are equal signatories.</p> <p>Georgia is a symptom of a broader Nato malfunction. Since the 1999 <a href=\"http://www.nato.int/docu/comm/1999/9904-wsh/9904-wsh.htm\">Washington summit</a>, Nato has taken on a global expeditionary role under what was then described as the alliance's \"new strategic concept\". That strategic concept has been undermined since the American-British intervention in Iraq. Its first major operation beyond its original defence area (\"from the Atlantic to the Urals\" in the original treaty) in Afghanistan is now at serious risk of losing focus. One wonders if Nato is the right organisation for running an assistance operation like <a href=\"http://www.nato.int/ISAF/index.html\">Isaf</a> \u2013 particularly as well under a third of the alliance nations are prepared to employ arms to any effective purpose in the mission.</p> <p>The same genetic disorder haunts the EU foreign and security policy arm, and the UN \u2013 high on rhetoric, low on the means to achieve practical results. President Sarkozy, and his foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, according to the voices from Tbilisi and the Elys\u00e9e, are talking about sending an EU peacekeeping force to South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Somebody should restrain them from such an ill-considered gesture \u2013 at best they would be keeping the peace where there is little to keep, and at worst Sarkozy and Kouchner would be delivering a handful of hostages and kidnap candidates.</p> <p>The OSCE is a different matter. Its <a href=\"http://www.osce.org/item/4046.html\">founding document (pdf)</a>, the Helsinki Final Act, strikes at the heart of the crisis in Georgia, and almost anyone else where minority rights and self-determination are under threat. The organisation came into being in the depths of the cold war \u2013 surprisingly so. It was supported by the US and western European nations as well as the Soviet Union.</p> <p>The articles of the Final Act uphold the right of religious and ethnic minorities to self-determination, while at the same time maintain that recognised borders of sovereign territories should not be altered by violence and aggression. These propositions lie at the heart of the contest between Moscow and Tbilisi \u2013 as they do in the question of Kosovo, the wars of Yugoslavia's dissolution and dozens of other disputes that continue to spark brushfire wars across the world.</p> <p>One of the striking aspects of the Georgia crisis is the absence of ideology. There has been no invocation of great heroes or great theorists \u2013 the biggest Georgian of them all, Josef Stalin, has been put under a shroud by both principal parties. The presiding shades have been those of the <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;id=NAB0VtXCggIC&amp;dq=the+art+of+war+Sun+Tzu&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=TcfOuQQOSp&amp;sig=WuI4ozAZ7Vpn2ugRh1_-UVchYTY&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result\">Sun Tzu</a> and <a href=\"http://www.constitution.org/mac/prince00.htm\">Machiavelli</a> \u2013 who advocated that above all a successful commander must exploit opportunity presented suddenly on the battlefield \u2013 fortuna, as the Machiavelli put it in the The Prince.</p> <p>When Georgian forces advanced on the South Ossetian capital last Thursday, they presented the Russians with their moment of fortuna. It allowed them to re-assert their military might and claim the \"security space of their regional neighbourhood\". This sounds an extraordinarily cynical piece of contemporary geopolitics-speak \u2013 but after all it is only a variant of the notion of \"vital interests\" of imperial powers through the centuries.</p> <p>This morning, the BBC's diplomatic correspondent suggested that \"Russia may find itself the diplomatic loser\" in the present crisis. This may indeed be the comforting chatter in the chanceries of Europe and America right now, but as the sacked secretary of the Florentine republic, one Nicol\u00f2 Machiavelli, would say \u2013 it is beside the point.</p>",
  "<p>The rise in carbon dioxide emissions is big news. It is prompting action to reverse global warming. But little or no attention is being paid to the long-term fall in oxygen concentrations and its knock-on effects. </p> <p>Compared to prehistoric times, the level of oxygen in the earth's atmosphere has declined by over a third and in polluted cities the decline may be more than 50%. This change in the makeup of the air we breathe has potentially serious implications for our health. Indeed, it could ultimately threaten the survival of human life on earth, according to Roddy Newman, who is drafting a new book, The Oxygen Crisis.</p> <p>I am not a scientist, but this seems a reasonable concern. It is a possibility that we should examine and assess. So, what's the evidence? </p> <p>Around 10,000 years ago, the planet's <a href=\"http://www.unep.org/geo/GDOutlook/\">forest cover</a> was at least twice what it is today, which means that forests are now emitting only half the amount of oxygen. </p> <p>Desertification and deforestation are rapidly accelerating this long-term loss of oxygen sources. </p> <p>The story at sea is much the same. Nasa reports that in the north Pacific ocean oxygen-producing <a href=\"http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/topstory/20020801plankton.html\">phytoplankton concentrations</a> are 30% lower today, compared to the 1980s. This is a huge drop in just three decades. </p> <p>Moreover, the UN environment programme confirmed in 2004 that there were nearly 150 \"<a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4624359/\">dead zones</a>\" in the world's oceans where discharged sewage and industrial waste, farm fertiliser run-off and other pollutants have reduced oxygen levels to such an extent that most or all sea creatures can no longer live there. This oxygen starvation is reducing regional fish stocks and diminishing the food supplies of populations that are dependent on fishing. It also causes genetic mutations and hormonal changes that can affect the reproductive capacity of sea life, which could further diminish global fish supplies.</p> <p>Professor <a href=\"http://earth.geology.yale.edu/~berner/\">Robert Berner</a> of Yale University has researched oxygen levels in prehistoric times by chemically analysing air bubbles trapped in fossilised tree amber. He suggests that humans breathed a much more oxygen-rich air 10,000 years ago.</p> <p>Further back, the oxygen levels were even greater. <a href=\"http://www.geo.umn.edu/people/profs/SLOAN.html\">Robert Sloan</a> has listed the percentage of oxygen in samples of dinosaur-era amber as: 28% (130m years ago), 29% (115m years ago), 35% (95m years ago), 33% (88m years ago), 35% (75m years ago), 35% (70m years ago), 35% (68m years ago), 31% (65.2m years ago), and 29% (65m years ago).</p> <p>Professor <a href=\"http://www.expertguide.com.au/!ProfessorIanPlimer!_7859.aspx\">Ian Plimer</a> of Adelaide University and Professor <a href=\"http://sols.asu.edu/faculty/jharrison.php\">Jon Harrison</a> of the University of Arizona concur. Like most other scientists they accept that oxygen levels in the atmosphere in prehistoric times averaged around 30% to 35%, compared to only 21% today \u2013 and that the levels are even less in densely populated, polluted city centres and industrial complexes, perhaps only 15 % or lower. </p> <p>Much of this recent, accelerated change is down to human activity, notably the industrial revolution and the burning of fossil fuels. The Professor of Geological Sciences at Notre Dame University in Indiana, <a href=\"http://www.nd.edu/~cegeos/people/faculty/rigby.htm\">J Keith Rigby</a>, was quoted in 1993-1994 as saying: </p> <blockquote> <p>In the 20th century, humanity has pumped increasing amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere by burning the carbon stored in coal, petroleum and natural gas. In the process, we've also been consuming oxygen and destroying plant life \u2013 cutting down forests at an alarming rate and thereby short-circuiting the cycle's natural rebound. We're artificially slowing down one process and speeding up another, forcing a change in the atmosphere.</p> </blockquote> <p>Very interesting. But does this decline in oxygen matter? Are there any practical consequences that we ought to be concerned about? What is the effect of lower oxygen levels on the human body? Does it disrupt and impair our immune systems and therefore make us more prone to cancer and degenerative diseases? </p> <p>Surprisingly, no significant research has been done, perhaps on the following presumption: the decline in oxygen levels has taken place over millions of years of our planet's existence. The changes during the shorter period of human life have also been slow and incremental \u2013 until the last two centuries of rapid urbanisation and industrialisation. Surely, this mostly gradual decline has allowed the human body to evolve and adapt to lower concentrations of oxygen? Maybe, maybe not. </p> <p>The pace of oxygen loss is likely to have speeded up massively in the last three decades, with the industrialisation of China, India, South Korea and other countries, and as a consequence of the massive worldwide increase in the burning of fossil fuels. </p> <p>In the view of Professor <a href=\"http://www.goipeace.or.jp/english/activities/award/award.html\">Ervin Laszlo</a>, the drop in atmospheric oxygen has potentially serious consequences. A UN advisor who has been a professor of philosophy and systems sciences, Laszlo <a href=\"http://www.ebooks.com/ebooks/book_display.asp?IID=113897\">writes</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Evidence from prehistoric times indicates that the oxygen content of pristine nature was above the 21% of total volume that it is today. It has decreased in recent times due mainly to the burning of coal in the middle of the last century. Currently the oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere dips to 19% over impacted areas, and it is down to 12 to 17% over the major cities. At these levels it is difficult for people to get sufficient oxygen to maintain bodily health: it takes a proper intake of oxygen to keep body cells and organs, and the entire immune system, functioning at full efficiency. At the levels we have reached today cancers and other degenerative diseases are likely to develop. And at 6 to 7% life can no longer be sustained.</p> </blockquote> <p>Scaremongering? I don't think so. A reason for doomsaying? Not yet. What is needed is an authoritative evidence-based investigation to ascertain current oxygen levels and what consequences, if any, there are for the long-term wellbeing of our species \u2013 and, indeed, of all species.</p>",
  "<p>If the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/14/world/europe/14georgia.html\">shaky cease-fire</a> takes hold in Georgia, then the 21st century's version of the Six Day war may mercifully be coming to an end. That will come as a relief - especially for those caught up in the fighting, and for American and European leaders whose <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/08/20080809-2.html\">impotence</a> in stopping the Russian advance has been laid bare before the world.</p> <p>The unfortunate lesson of the Russo-Georgian war is that this is the first tangible example outside of the Middle East of how George Bush's catastrophic foreign policy has weakened the US and the West. The next American president has been dealt a terrible hand - but he must take immediate steps to prevent this situation from getting worse.</p> <p>The root causes of the West's alarming helplessness lie in the broad strategic failure of the Bush administration's foreign policy. It first alienated and then <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1392791.stm\">badly misread Putin's character and intentions</a>, only realising his true threat to Western interests after it was too late. The administration then invaded Iraq, splitting the Western alliance, undermining international institutions, and bogging down American troops in a long and bloody occupation that has eroded the West's deterrent force. Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib have weakened respect for international norms and further damaged <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/06/27/news/pew.php\">American global leadership</a>. Iran has been the major regional beneficiary of the US invasion, projecting power across the Middle East through its support of militants in Iraq, Lebanon, and the Palestinian territories. </p> <p>America's struggles, Iran's gains and Israel's fears together significantly increase Russia's leverage and influence. The US and Europe need Russian cooperation to curtail Iranian nuclear weapons development because Moscow can make or break economic sanctions and any long term solution is going to require Russian support.</p> <p>Beyond these strategic gifts from the US, Russia itself has gained strength and is no longer the weak and declining superpower that characterised much of the post-Soviet period. A booming economy built on soaring energy prices and a strong autocratic government have fed into Putin's efforts to restore the confidence and pride of the once-great Russian nation. This new Russia now seeks to reclaim its place on the world stage.</p> <p>In a feeble bid to push back, the Bush administration feted the democratically elected governments of Ukraine and Georgia as the antidote to the Kremlin's ambitions. Bush went to Tbilisi and <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/05/20050510-2.html\">promised the Georgians</a> that \"as you build a free and democratic Georgia, the American people will stand with you.\" Georgia even sent 2,000 troops to fight in Iraq. It was not unreasonable for the Georgians to think that America would back them. Of course Putin knew that it could not. </p> <p>John McCain has no understanding of just how weak America's position is in this crisis and his response has been to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/12/us/politics/12mccain.html\">escalate the confrontation</a> with Russia - putting America and the world on a dangerous course towards conflict should he become US president. Drawing <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/12/AR2008081202935.html\">obvious allusions</a> to Hitler's march into the Sudetenland, McCain said of Russia's rout of Georgian forces: \"we learned at great cost the price of allowing aggression against free nations to go unchecked.\" He compounds the irresponsible rhetoric of the Bush administration, yet he proposes nothing to address America's complete lack of leverage. </p> <p>Even though it is unlikely that Russia will again resort to force in the near future, it is guaranteed to press its advantage in countries like Ukraine and other former Soviet republics. If America and the West are to summon any meaningful response, we must stop issuing hollow threats and begin to address Russia's current points of leverage. </p> <p>The first step is to get serious about resolving the nuclear standoff with Iran. Putin's trump card is that the West is appropriately more concerned about an aggressive nuclear armed Iran than it is about Russia asserting control over its near abroad. Russia's clear power play has raised the stakes in reaching an acceptable settlement with Tehran and we simply cannot allow that process to drag on indefinitely while Russia presses its advantage and Israel grows more concerned. </p> <p>A great deal of Russia's economic power is based on rising energy prices and its massive reserves of natural gas. That is not likely to change in the short term, but it is possible to lower energy costs and lessen the strategic importance of fossil fuel reserves by transforming our economies to run on renewable energy sources. This would create a finite time horizon after which Russia's dominant energy position will be less significant. </p> <p>The energy boom has generated enormous wealth in Russia that has covered over numerous looming crises. Its public institutions are rife with corruption, its infrastructure is crumbling, its health system is a shambles, and it is facing a demographic time bomb of an aging population and a rapidly declining birth-rate. These are all areas in which the US and Europe can help improve the lives of the Russian people. Doing so would require a difficult shift in the orientation of aid programs away from a focus on democracy promotion, but it has the chance of reversing the reputation of the West within Russia and lessening the appetite for confrontation. </p> <p>These soft power moves must also be accompanied by the restoration of the credibility of American hard power by bringing the occupation of Iraq to a responsible conclusion. Only then can we reset our military forces and restore their deterrent capabilities. Russia does not want to get into a shooting war with the United States. It can act aggressively now because it knows that is not a realistic possibility. A credible deterrent of strong and united Western forces would surely help dissuade Putin from rash actions.</p> <p>Barack Obama has put forward a comprehensive foreign and security policy compatible with each of these steps: early and high-level negotiations with Iran; transitioning towards a green economy; emphasising human dignity and peoples' needs and aspirations in US aid programs; and ending the war in Iraq. John McCain proposes doing none of these things as he hurtles towards confrontation with both Russia and Iran, seemingly intent on turning this bad situation into a terrifying one.</p>",
  "<p>Dozens of companies face having to report embarrassing sharp increases in their carbon pollution under government plans to crack down on greenwash. </p> <p>The move could undermine the environmental claims of firms such as BT, which have invested heavily in so-called green electricity tariffs to cut their carbon footprints. </p> <p>Under the proposed changes, companies using such green tariffs, which are also popular with eco-friendly domestic customers, will no longer be able to claim massive carbon savings by using power coming from renewable sources. </p> <p>BT, which could be forced to double its reported carbon emissions and to scrap an ambitious target to cut carbon 80% by 2020 under the plan, is lobbying heavily against the move, and says other companies back its position. Johnson and Johnson, Vodafone and several banks including HSBC also buy green electricity tariffs. </p> <p>Hilary Benn, environment secretary, said the change was to make the system more transparent and to ensure that such tariffs brought genuine environmental benefits. \"It is increasingly difficult to demonstrate that buying a renewable electricity tariff is offering additional carbon emissions reductions,\" he said. \"Businesses signed up to green tariffs based on the evidence available at the time, but their choices have been producing only limited additional renewable generation capacity.\" </p> <p>Individual consumers opting for green tariffs may also \"not have been generating the environmental benefits they anticipated\", he added. </p> <p>Green tariffs have become a popular way for firms and individuals to cut their carbon footprints. They exploit the 5% of UK grid electricity generated from clean hydroelectric and wind sources, which suppliers claim they can effectively ringfence and sell separately.</p> <p>In 2005, the government said companies buying such renewable electricity tariffs could report them as producing zero emissions. It hoped that wide take-up of green tariffs would drive investment in further renewable sources.</p> <p>But environmental campaigners and energy experts have long questioned the benefits of some green tariffs. Harry Morrison of the Carbon Trust, which advises companies on climate issues, says the market in them has been \"a bit cowboy\" and needs clearing up. He compared the use of green tariffs to the sale of carbon offsets, with concern over transparency, double counting and additionality \u2013 ie whether they cut carbon emissions over and above what would have happened anyway.</p> <p>He said: \"Many companies bought these tariffs in good faith but there are no guarantees that they actually save carbon. They didn't pay much of a premium for the carbon savings they could claim in their marketing statements, so they have basically been given a free ride.\"</p> <p>Morrison said many companies were concerned about how the government's changes would affect their green credentials and corporate image. It could also cost them money. From 2010, thousands of UK companies will be forced to calculate, publish and reduce their emissions as part of a domestic carbon trading scheme. \"They're worried about being ranked badly. Nobody wants to come bottom of a table of their peers,\" he said.</p> <p>Richard Tarboton, energy and carbon programme director at BT, said: \"This is a serious problem for a number of companies who have followed the government's guidelines and gone out and purchased green electricity, and are now being told that green source is no longer valid.\" </p> <p>BT, one of the country's largest users of electricity, has used the zero-carbon rating given to green tariffs to claim it has reduced its emissions 58% over the last decade. Tarboton said the new rules would see its reported emissions double, and that the increase would pose \"communication\" problems for the firm.</p> <p>He agreed that the existing scheme was flawed but said the suggested solution put too much responsibility on energy suppliers and let customers off the hook. BT says the answer is better labelling, with different tariffs given a carbon rating similar to electrical appliances such as dishwashers. It held a meeting of 30 companies this week to discuss the idea.</p> <p>Defra, the environment department, which announced the changes to the company reporting guidelines in June, now says it will launch a consultation on the proposal. A spokesman denied this was down to corporate pressure and said the department had always planned to consult.</p>",
  "<p>Scientists have lined up to condemn <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/13/prince.charles.gm.farming\"> Prince Charles's passionate attack on genetically modified crops and industrial farming</a>. </p> <p>While his vivid vision of \"conducting a gigantic experiment with nature \u2026 which has gone seriously wrong\" has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/13/gmcrops.food\">garnered support from some</a>, including <a href=\"http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/press_releases/gmprincecharles_130808.html\">Friends of the Earth</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.soilassociation.org/web/sa/saweb.nsf/195e597ae6f23abc80256ada0051a50f/04e9204e919498eb802574a400371346!OpenDocument\">Soil Association</a>, researchers have attacked his criticisms as \"scientifically and morally indefensible\" and accused the Prince of \"showy environmentalism\".</p> <p>The following reactions were gathered by the <a href=\"http://www.sciencemediacentre.org\">Science Media Centre</a>.</p> <p><strong>Scientifically and morally indefensible</strong><br>Ian Denholm, Head of plant and Invertebrate Ecology at Rothamsted Research Institute: \"No scientist working in the agricultural sector doubts that the intensification of cropping over the last 50 or so years, coupled with climate change in some cases, has led to severe challenges including areas of land becoming unsuitable for the cultivation of conventional crop varieties. It is scientifically and morally indefensible not to explore, without prejudice, GM technology as one possible solution to these problems.\"</p> <p><strong>Showy environmentalism</strong><br>Johnjoe McFadden, molecular geneticist at the University of Surrey:<br>\"Prince Charles claims that GM crops will be an environmental disaster. But his vision for agriculture would be a much greater disaster for the world's poor whose primary concern is to find their next meal. Recent studies demonstrate that GM crops can generate crop yield increases, particularly in the developing world where so much food crop ends up in the belly of an insect or destroyed by drought. Meanwhile, while much of the world starves, Prince Charles tells the poor to eat organic cake and spends a fortune converting his Aston Martin to run off 'surplus' wine as a display of conspicuous environmentalism. Yet to drive from London to his Highgrove estate in his converted Aston consumes wine produced from about a ton of grapes, food resource that would be far better diverted to feed hungry mouths. Prince Charles showy environmentalism is a luxury that makes the poor poorer.\"</p> <p><strong>Denying our collective responsibility</strong><br>Professor Alison M Smith OBE, Research Group Leader at the John Innes Centre, said: \"Prince Charles indulges in diatribes in which he appears to blame the problems of the planet on a single technological advance that he has completely misunderstood. GM crops are NOT to blame for climate change, the industrialisation of agriculture, the spread of dysfunctional conurbations, the salinisation of Australia or indeed any of the other crimes of which the Prince appears to accuse them. These problems arise from a collective failure of societies - all of us - to live within the resources of our planet. To blame all of these problems on a single technology is to deny our collective responsibility for the mess we've created.\"</p> <p><strong>No threat to small scale farmers</strong><br>Giles Oldroyd, Research Group Leader at the John Innes Centre, said: \"Genetic modification is and will continue to provide valuable solutions to improve the sustainability of our agricultural systems, but maintain the yields that are essential for global food production. Genetic modification is not a threat to small scale farmers. We function in a free market and small scale farmers, just as large scale farmers, can choose to plant GM seed or not. The Prince's ill informed and confusing statements are counterproductive to a rational debate on our food production systems.\"<br> <br><strong>Missing the point</strong><br>Rosie Hails, ecologist at the Centre For Ecology And Hydrology:<br>\"To label GM crops as either good or bad for the environment completely misses the point. The scientific evidence shows that some GM crops \u2013 for example those resistant to insect pests \u2013 can actually bring environmental benefits, by reducing the application of synthetic pesticides.\"</p> <p><strong>Ignoring economic benefits</strong><br>Jim Dunwell, biological scientist at the University of Reading: \"GM crops are being grown on a large scale in many countries of the world, a total of 114m hectares in 2007, mainly in North America, Brazil and Argentina. It has been estimated recently that over the last 10 years they have provided an economic benefit to the farmers growing these crops of $33.8bn. Also the reduction of energy needed to cultivate the crops is estimated to be equivalent to taking 6.5m cars off the roads.\"</p>",

  "<p>Still lots of Clinton news: Dowd today, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/opinion/13dowd.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=login\">arguing</a> that Hillary is plotting to steal the convention spotlight (struck me as overbaked); this HuffPo <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/08/12/clintons-still-want-to-ki_n_118415.html\">report</a> on an incipient (and quickly short-circuited by Howard Dean) effort at last weekend's Democratic platform committee meeting to pass a resolution banning caucuses from future nominating processes; and of course Josh Green's <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200809/hillary-clinton-campaign\">much-discussed Atlantic piece</a>, based on leaked memos and emails, on the internal Clinton campaign mishegas.</p> <p>Well, there's a lot to say about all this \u2013 Mark Penn's megalomania, Bill Clinton's petulance and so on. But as we approach the official end of the era of Clintonian rule of the Democratic Party \u2013 that is, it will end at the convention when Barack Obama becomes the official nominee \u2013 my bottom-line reaction is as follows.</p> <p>There were lots of Democrats around Washington \u2013 and I mean here specifically party insiders, not rank-and-filers \u2013 who supported Barack Obama without knowing a great deal about him in part because they just didn't want to live eight more years of Clinton dominance and drama. They lived it once, and many of them lived it more or less happily, with the obvious <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewinsky_scandal\">perturbations</a> and hiccups. But once was enough. It just isn't natural, it's not part of the proper order of things -- and it's not, in some fundamental way, democratic -- for one family to claim the White House for 16 out of 24 years (assuming Hillary had won two terms).</p> <p>And if you want to counter \"but what about Bush?\", well a) that's different, because at least it was a generational change, a different first family, and the ex-president, far from living in the White House again, stayed in Houston and played golf and mostly kept his mouth admirably shut, which First Husband Clinton would not have done, and b) it's not as if the Bush experiment has been a blessing. This is not to equate the Clintons and the Bushes in policy terms, because obviously the former are, to my way of thinking, much to be preferred.</p> <p>But it is to say something I thought from the very start of this whole process, and in my anecdotal experience a lot of people thought: Having two families run the country for 28 years (i.e., from 1988 to 2016, again assuming two Hillary terms) is just weird and inappropriate. </p> <p>Beyond that, who really wanted to spend another eight years watching Mark Penn call shots, watching Lanny Davis and Terry McAuliffe screech on television, and so on. There were other reasons to back Hillary, and I understand them. But it's natural for people to want something very simple and human, a new set of faces to see and a new complex of dramas to worry about. </p> <p>Those three, in particular, Hillary should have cashiered long ago. They never really should have been a part of her campaign. It's not that Penn's advice was all terrible. Indeed, the Green report allows that some of it was right, like his anticipation that the blue-collar \"invisible\" people would be her most reliable base. Also, and this is a deeply counter-intuitive thought, but I suspect Penn may have been right in late 2007 that harder attacks on Obama at that time might have knocked him off his pedestal and secured her the nomination. </p> <p>But Penn, with McAuliffe and Davis, represented an old-guard regnancy of people more associated with her husband than her. Howard Wolfson, by contrast, was her person. But the old Bill people \u2013 and, of course, Bill himself \u2013 did not help her cause, with the exception, I'd say, of Harold Ickes, but Ickes has always been both a Bill <em>and</em> Hillary person. She was loyal to them, and that's understandable, but loyal has its limits, and a leader has to do what a leader has to do. Even Springsteen dumped the E Street Band for a little while, because it served Springsteen's purposes. That's life.</p> <p>I hope both Clintons now understand that electing Obama is in their long-term interest. If he loses, and part of the problem is that the party remained divided, their reputations will suffer for a long, long, long \u2013did I mention long? \u2013 time.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/13/prince.charles.gm.farming\">Prince Charles' warnings that genetically modified crops and industrial agriculture</a> will lead to ecological disaster appear only to be adding a dose of passion to the cooler analysis of world's leading agronomists, climate scientists and grassroots groups in developing countries, who have been saying much the same about farming and ecology for some time. <br><em><br>When asked whether \"industrial scale food conglomerates are the way ahead\", he said: \"What, all run by gigantic corporations? Is that really the answer? I think not. That would be the absolute destruction of everything.\"</em></p> <p><strong>Anaylsis:</strong> Charles echoes <a href=\"http://www.biosafety-info.net/\">Third World Network</a> and <a href=\"http://www.viacampesina.org/main_en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogcategory&amp;id=22&amp;Itemid=37\">Via Campesina</a>, the world's two most authoritative farm analysis groups, and is aiming at global agribusinesses which dominate the food chain, and controls seed supplies, chemicals, and food processing as well as transport and retail sales. He also echoes <a href=\"http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/board/andrewjarvis17jul08.pdf\">Food Matters, a report from the No 10 Strategy Unit</a>, which recognises that the agribusiness model of food production based on global competition has failed to deliver. <br><em><br>\"Corporations [are] conducting a gigantic experiment with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong. Why else are we facing all these challenges, climate change and everything?\"</em></p> <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Charles links climate change and world hunger with the growth of agribusiness and its reliance on oil, large amounts of scarce water, and chemicals. The UN, the UK government and the EU recognise that industrial agriculture, including biofuel, soy and palm oil industries, have been responsible for large-scale deforestation, as well as hunger and a growth in carbon emissions, soil erosion and social problems. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2006/1000448/index.html\">UN's Food and Agricultural Organisation said in 2006</a>: \"The [global] livestock business is among the most damaging sectors to the earth's increasingly scarce water resources.\"<br><em><br>\"A nightmare vision ... in which millions of small farmers are driven off their land and into unsustainable unmanageable, degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness.\"</em></p> <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> According to <a href=\"http://www.unhabitat.org/pmss/getPage.asp?page=bookView&amp;book=2101\">UN Habitat</a>, cities are growing by 180,000 people a day and the world's urban infrastructure is unable to cope. Roughly one billion people in Latin America, Asia, and Africa live in slums. The <a href=\"http://www.commissionforafrica.org/english/report/thereport/english/11-03-05_cr_report.pdf\">UK government's Commission for Africa said in 2005</a>: \"These slums are filled with the unemployed and disaffected. Africa's cities are becoming a powder keg of ... instability and discontent.\" According to a major UN report in 2003, the greatest underlying reason for the growth in slums has been globalisation.<br><em><br>\"We are missing the point. We should be discussing food security, not food production. that is what matters and that is what people will not understand.\"</em> </p> <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Charles echoes the <a href=\"http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jul2008/2008-07-09-03.asp\">G8 world leaders</a> who stated in Japan in July: \"We are deeply concerned that the steep rise in global food prices coupled with availability problems in a number of developing countries is threatening global food security.\" The UN declared in May: \"Securing world food security may be one of the biggest challenges we face in this century.\"</p> <p><em>\"And if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out, because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time.\" </em></p> <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The <a href=\"http://www.agassessment.org/index.cfm?Page=Press_Materials&amp;ItemID=11\">UN International Assessment of Agriculture</a> (IAASTD), carried out by 400 leading agronomists and scientists with the help of the World Bank found no conclusive evidence that GM crops increase crop yields or that they were the single answer to global hunger. The report, endorsed by 60 countries including the UK this year, stated that science and technology must be combined with traditional knowledge, working with communities on localised farming solutions.<br><em><br>\"Small farmers ... would be the victims of gigantic corporations taking over the mass production of food.\"</em></p> <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/\">FAO</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/\">World Bank</a> and nearly all international development groups argue strongly that peasant farmers must be helped to produce more food. The World Bank, the UK's <a href=\"http://www.nfuonline.com/\">National Farmers' Union</a> and the <a href=\"http://europa.eu/index_en.htm\">EU</a> all recognise that the growth of agribusiness is linked to a worldwide decrease in the number of small farms. </p> <p><em>\"I have been to the Punjab where you have seen the disasters that have taken place ...\" </em></p> <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The <a href=\"http://livingheritage.org/green-revolution.htm\">Punjab in India was the centre of the Green Revolution</a> which introduced hybrid seeds, intensive irrigation and chemical fertlisers and pesticides in the 1960s and 70s. According to Reith lecturer and Indian ecologist Vandana Shiva: \"Today every farmer is in debt and despair. Vast stretches of land have become water-logged desert.\"</p> <p><em>\"Look at western Australia. Huge salinisation problems. I have been there. Seen it. Some of the excessive approaches to modern forms of agriculture.\"</em><br> <strong>Analysis:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.agric.wa.gov.au/content/lwe/salin/salinity_index.htm\">The government of western Australia</a> says on its website: \"Salinity is one of the greatest environmental threats facing Western Australia's agricultural land, water, biodiversity and infrastructure. It is caused by too much water containing dissolved salts in the wrong places in the landscape.\"<br><em><br>\"I think it's heading for real disaster.\" </em><br><strong><br>Analysis:</strong> Prince Charles is referring to global ecological problems. Here he echoes many climate change scientists, UN figures and politicians. His language \u2013 \"unmentionable awfulness\", etc \u2013 may be quaint, but is he the crank some would have us believe him to be? Absolutely not.</p>",
  "<p>Fife and Westminster has lost a man who shared the values of people brought up in the Labour movement in central Scotland: a grafter in whatever job he took on, a deep concern for others and belief in social justice that had been drilled into him by his parents. </p> <p>Born in Dunfermline, John spent most of his life in Burntisland, moving only when he felt that he should be living in the constituency he represented as a member of parliament. </p> <p>Educated at Templehall secondary school in Kirkcaldy, John completed his apprenticeship as a boilermaker before studying naval architecture at the Royal Dockyard College. He later achieved a Diploma in Industrial Management, becoming a member of the Institute of Industrial Managers. He also became a director of Glenrothes Development Corporation and Fife Enterprise, gaining boardroom and business skills.</p> <p>John was an active trade unionist all his adult life. He worked at the RGC oil rig construction yard in Methil and in 1978 became a shop steward, soon after being elected Shop Stewards Convenor. </p> <p>He often referred to the fact that he never led a strike, stating, \"I never had to. I could win more for the men through argument and negotiation\". In his role as convenor he attended the Westminster parliament, little knowing that he would later become an MP. </p> <p>John entered local politics in 1981 as a result of the sudden death of the sitting councillor in Burntisland. His quick decision to accept the Labour nomination changed his life. John's local popularity, and a highly active Labour party branch, helped return a massive majority, something that he maintained throughout his 19 years as councillor for the Burntisland area. </p> <p>In his last few weeks, John talked about the first evening that we canvassed the voters of Burntisland back in 1981. I reminded him that I had expressed surprise at the canvass return from one street that showed over 90% support. He asked to see the sheet, smiled and said that I was not to worry about those people who had not been in, \"My mum knows them all: they'll all be Labour.\" And so it proved.</p> <p>Among the many projects in which he was involved, the opening of the Beacon leisure centre and swimming pool in Burntisland gave him the greatest satisfaction. The town's open-air pool, closed long before his election, stood as a symbol of municipal neglect. </p> <p>John used his considerable knowledge of European funding and of local government finance to secure an excellent facility for his adopted home town. His successful campaign for a local bus service in the Burntisland area also gave him great satisfaction. </p> <p>The sense of freedom that this benefit brought to so many people produced a determination in John to retain the free bus pass for the elderly. Fife was the first council in Scotland to introduce free travel for the elderly, and John brought his considerable skills into several tough negotiations when the service was under threat.</p> <p>John always felt a debt of gratitude to those councillors who took him under their wing, particularly the Labour leader in Fife at the time, Bert Gough, from whom he learned so much. He became the longest serving leader of Fife Regional Council, spending nearly nine years in post, and became leader of Fife Council in 1996. </p> <p>He also led the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities before leaving this post to fight to keep Fife as a single local authority. The importance of trade links with Europe became of increasing interest to John. His tireless work in this field led to him being honoured as vice-president of the Assembly of European Regions.</p> <p>While leader in Fife John promoted many initiatives, including the superfast ferry service from Rosyth and the park and ride facility to relieve the pressure on the Forth Road Bridge. He was one of the first councillors to begin to campaign for a second road crossing over the Forth. </p> <p>Ever the pragmatist, John argued that with increasing prosperity working people would not abandon their cars. Along with Gordon Brown, he was also at the forefront of the campaign to save Rosyth Dockyard. </p> <p>In parliament, John continued to advocate a strong relationship between local and central government, typified through his work with the Lee O'Brien Solvent Trust and DAPL (Drugs and Alcohol Leven) which work closely with Fife council. He also took a keen interest in the drugs debate at all European levels, particularly in Holland, where he learned a great deal on his visits.</p> <p>In his latter years, John's priorities centred on the issue of renewable energy. He had a vision that saw Fife emerge as a leader in clean coal technology, while developing renewables. </p> <p>John saw it as logical that following the golden age of coal and oil, Fife had a vital role to play in this field. On occasion John shared his frustration with friends and colleagues at what he saw as the confusion that devolution of renewable energy to Holyrood had caused in the provision of energy nationally. </p> <p>John's loyalty to the Labour party and its leadership was never in doubt. He firmly believed that \"washing your dirty linen in public\" was simply daft politics. Any reservations that he had about policy, people or presentation were never aired in public. </p> <p>In his final months, John made it down to Westminster to support the prime minister and the government in the vote on 42 days detention for terror suspects. </p> <p>Although in great pain and discomfort he made the journey by train in the company of his daughter Julie. Emotions ran high when he met Gordon Brown, as they did when Gordon visited him in final days at Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy.</p> <p>Even knowing that he was in his last few weeks of life John continued to work in his constituency. His last campaign was to try to persuade the Post Office that an upstairs branch in WH Smith in the Town Centre in Glenrothes did not meet the needs of many elderly and disabled constituents. By this time John was using a wheelchair to move around and fully understood the frustrations of those who had made representations to him.</p> <p>For a man who spent a great deal of his time defending and improving the conditions of others, he saw the irony in the news that he had developed a very serious asbestos-related lung disease, mesothelioma. This cruel disease has a gestation period of 30-40 years, and John's time working at Rosyth was identified as the likely source of his illness. </p> <p>Despite extensive treatment and surgery under a medical trial at Guy's hospital in London, the prospect of long-term health improvements did not materialise. John bore his illness with great bravery and dignity, expressing concern only at what he increasingly saw as a postcode lottery in health treatment throughout the NHS.</p> <p>Those who went to John for assistance met a man who would move heaven and earth to help them. To all who new John there will remain a memory of a genuine man who always had a kind word and a warm smile. Even in last few painful days his sense of humour was never far from the surface. </p> <p>About six months after John had undergone a course of chemotherapy we walked into the Sports and Social Bar in the House of Commons. This bar is frequented by MPs, Lords and many staff who work in the House. About 50 people were standing and sitting as we entered. I was astonished when everyone in the bar broke into applause. </p> <p>He was surrounded by well-wishers from all walks of life. I went to the bar to pay for our drinks and was politely informed by the barman, \"Put that away, these are on us for John.\" A finer compliment I could not imagine, and the episode neatly captured John's unique ability to connect with everyone he met. </p> <p>John's was a life well lived.</p> <p>His leisure interests included cycling, walking, sport and vintage cars. </p> <p>John is survived by his mother, his wife Cathy, his children Scott and Julie, and his sister Christine.<br> \u0095 Scott Brady is the parliamentary researcher for John MacDougall.

A lot more in the case of the film we published today, showing a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/aug/13/fishing.endangeredspecies\">British trawler dumping five tonnes of perfectly good fish overboard</a>.</p> <p>The practice is legal, as the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/cfp_en.htm\">EU</a> only sets quotas for fish landed at ports, not what is actually caught at sea. In this case, it appears the fishermen were discarding low-value small (but legal) fish in order to fill their quota with higher-value big fish.</p> <p>To many this practice is simply insane. As is the annual bun-fight in December in Brussels when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2005/dec/23/food.politics\">EU fisheries ministers set the quotas</a>. First, they carefully consider the sustainable levels proposed by the <a href=\"http://www.ices.dk/indexfla.asp\">International Council for the Exploration of the Seas</a>, Europe's premier scientific body for fisheries research, and then override them in the name of political expediency.</p> <p>But the wasteful consequences of Europe's fisheries policies, though well-known, are rather abstract to most people - it all happens a long way out at sea. And that's the power of the video. At the start, a stream of dead, silvery fish slip down a chute and into the water. It goes on. And on. Seagulls gather to snap up a free lunch. </p> <p>But this is apparently not rapid enough. So the men start dumping whole boxfuls of their catch over the side. And then another load comes up from the hold, and so on.</p> <p>There is a terrible calm and openness about the whole operation - all in a day's work, it seems.</p> <p>Will this bring home the farcical nature of the fisheries policy, or do we have to wait for a total <a href=\"http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/overfishing-surpeche/media/bk_grandbanks_e.htm\">Grand-Banks</a>-style collapse?

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditsuisse\">Credit Suisse</a> has received a record \u00a35.6m fine from the Financial Services Authority following a scandal in which rogue traders in its investment banking division deliberately mispriced the asset-backed securities they held.</p> <p>The fine against Credit Suisse would have been as high as \u00a38m had it not been for prompt action and cooperation by the bank once the trading scandal came to light in February. It is the largest penalty for a breach of FSA principles by a regulated firm, and the second largest fine ever handed out by the watchdog.</p> <p>The pricing inaccuracies first came to the attention of senior management in February when Credit Suisse was forced to announce a $2.65bn (\u00a31.3bn) write-down and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/feb/19/europeanbanks.creditcrunch\">suspended several traders</a>. A month later it confirmed that an internal investigation had found a small number of traders had created pricing errors in their positions through \"intentional misconduct\". It said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/mar/21/europeanbanks.creditcrunch\">disciplinary action</a> had been taken.</p> <p>The episode \u2014 which centred on securities in controversial investment structures known as collateralised debt obligations (CDOs) \u2014 was highly damaging for already fragile investor sentiment in the banking sector. </p> <p>Investors have become highly distrustful of credit risk ratings attached to complex investments such as CDOs. A meltdown in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/subprimecrisis\">US sub-prime mortgage market</a> last year prompted a flight from credit risk around the world which caught the banks off guard. </p> <p>The last 12 months have seen <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/08/creditcrunch\">write-downs from global financial institutions total $270bn</a>, precipitated by this flight from risk and lingering scepticism about the thoroughness with which banks have been written down the value of assets held on their books.</p> <p>Today's fine specifically relates to supervision failures by management and to the lack of trader monitoring systems and controls.</p> <p>In a statement, Credit Suisse chief executive Brady Dougan said: \"This incident was unacceptable to me and the executive board. It does not represent the high ethical standards of Credit Suisse. Our overall control framework remains sound and we have taken actions to implement a remediation programme to address the findings of our internal review.\"</p> <p>The FSA declined to comment on whether it was disciplining the individual rogue traders identified by Credit Suisse's internal investigation. The regulator rarely confirms or denies ongoing investigations. In March the Swiss bank said: \"These employees have been terminated or have been suspended and are in the process of being disciplined under local employment law.\"</p> <p>Likely action from the FSA against the rogue trader individuals is expected to turn on a technical point \u2014 whether they were directly authorised to trade by the regulator, or whether they traded under the Credit Suisse's FSA authorisations.</p> <p>Margaret Cole, the FSA's director of enforcement, said the fine against Credit Suisse \"reflects our tougher stance on enforcement and our policy of imposing higher penalties to achieve credible deterrence.</p> <p>\"It is imperative, particularly in more challenging financial conditions, that firms have in place appropriate systems and controls to manage their risks. The [Credit Suisse] subsidiaries here failed to take appropriate steps to control the potentially high risk combination in the Structured Credit Group's holdings of exotic products, opaque valuations and high leverage. </p> <p>\"The sudden and unexpected announcement of the write-down had the potential to undermine market confidence.\"</p> <p>The only larger fine imposed by the regulator was a \u00a317m market abuse penalty relating to Shell's mis-stating of proved reserves in 2004.</p> <p>After today's fine against Credit Suisse, the next largest fine for a breach of FSA principles against a regulated firm was a \u00a34m penalty handed down to Citigroup in 2005, relating to a controversial European bonds trading strategy. The firm was also required to relinquish \u00a310m of trading profits. In 2006, Deutsche Bank was fined \u00a34m in part relating to inappropriate proprietary trading activity. It was forced to relinquish a further \u00a32.4m to cover losses it avoided during these episodes.</p>",
  "<p>The big story of the Olympics is, we are told, the battle between <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7552988.stm\">China and the United States</a> for control of the medal table; a microcosm for the struggle for political, economic and cultural hegemony in the new millennium, as the balance of power shifts from occident to orient.</p> <p>At the same time, there's another intriguing scrap going on in Beijing: the tussle between surface and reality; what we see and what actually is. Cynics might argue that the Chinese authorities have long had an interesting take on the truth, from the announcement of bumper harvests while millions starved during the great leap forwards, to today's paranoid policing of the internet. But the Olympics have seen a new kind of reality avoidance.</p> <p>First, the TV footage of the opening pyrotechnical display was revealed to be augmented by <a href=\"http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Beijing-Olympics-Opening-Ceremony-Faked-Firework-Footprints-Added-For-TV/Article/200808215075291?lid=ARTICLE_15075291\">computer graphics</a>; and at the same event a photogenic moppet was <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7556058.stm\">miming</a> for a less attractive singer; then we find that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/12/emptyseats\">empty seats</a> are being filled by volunteers, instructed to spread their cheers equitably between competing teams; and now comes confirmation that any <a href=\"http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-08/10/content_9125468.htm\">rainclouds</a> that might threaten visibility are being dispersed with rockets.</p> <p>What's intriguing, to a western mind at least, is that those responsible have been entirely upfront about their deceptions. \"Most of the audience thought it was filmed live,\" declared Gao Xialong, the creator of the \"firework footprints\" that captivated millions of TV viewers, \"so that was mission accomplished.\"</p> <p>This honest dishonesty, this brazen acknowledgment that reality can and should be tweaked in the cause of spectacle and atmosphere, is at once refreshing and alarming. Like the admission of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/11/georgebush.olympics2008\">beach volleyball</a> to the Olympic canon, it signifies the gradual but inevitable triumph of showbiz over sport, and raises difficult questions about how much more virtual wool can be pulled over the eyes of global viewers \u2013 and the extent to which they'll accept it.</p> <p>Until now, the biggest worry over the veracity of sporting achievement at the Olympics has been about the effect of drugs on performance. But in their lust for drama and spectacle, what's to stop armchair viewers buying into the digital enhancement of an event, airbrushing out gymnastic stumbles and dropped relay batons in the pursuit of athletic perfection? The <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/olympics/monkey/7521287.stm\">BBC's coverage</a> of the games has been abetted by the creators of Gorillaz, the pop group that doesn't exist. Why not a few similarly hyperreal athletes to liven up some of the less TV-friendly events? Following Gao's logic, it doesn't matter if punters subsequently find out that the previously unknown one-legged Belgian snatching the fencing gold was a formless concoction of ones and zeros: if they accept it at the time, well, mission accomplished.</p> <p>And this way, the Brits might win their trumpeted <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/09/olympics2012\">41 medals</a> after all.</p>",
  "<p>Now in the process of starting work on his 11th studio album, we caught 15 minutes backstage with hip-hop's very own superstar, at the ThisDay Africa Rising festival... </p> <p><strong>AS: I went to New York this year and all the houses had campaign posters for Barack Obama or Hilary Clinton. This one house had a campaign poster that said: \"Jay-Z: the name you can trust\". Maybe you should think about politics?</strong></p> <p>Jay-Z: [Laughs hard] That's crazy. Yeah, maybe I should think about it, at least I know I have one vote right? [Laughs] That's a cool story, thank you for sharing.</p> <p><strong>You've been involved with the ThisDay Festival [global event with dates in Nigeria, the US and the UK] for some time, and have already played the Nigerian and US dates this year. What made you sign up? </strong></p> <p>I know Nduka [ThisDay corporation owner]. I see a young man trying to do something to bring awareness to Africa, being an entrepreneur about it, I thought it was cool. I come from that scheme myself. It was something that caught my interest, something I felt I should align myself with. You know Africa is the homeland, so anything like this, or the water project I worked with, where I can help bring attention to or help out the mother land, well, that's a beautiful feeling. </p> <p><strong>Will you be involved with the London leg of the festival in October?</strong></p> <p>We will see. Early days yet, but maybe... </p> <p><strong>You recently told MTV you would like to release an album at the end of this year or the beginning of next. With American Gangster being a concept album that worked so well for you, would that be something you'd like to do again?</strong></p> <p>Well I haven't been to the studio as of yet, so I'm far away from shaping creatively what it is going to be.</p> <p><strong>Do you think if you release an album so soon after American Gangster, it will lose the anticipation factor?</strong></p> <p>I make great music. Anticipation is cool - the hype of it is fantastic - but if you look at my track record, I have had albums in 96, 97, 98, 99, 01, 02 ... So I have always been an artist who's been consistent - not only for releasing albums but consistent with the quality of the music as well. The music will speak for itself. </p> <p><strong>So when Timbaland told MTV that he was going to be the sole producer of your next album, had you even talked about that? </strong></p> <p>We did have a conversation about the album, we discussed ideas, but it's so early that I can't even say he is going to be on the album. I mean we haven't even done anything yet. So yeah, the statement was a little premature for Timbaland to make.</p> <p><strong>You've toured Europe and your set at Glastonbury won over the critics - do you think that will inspire you musically? </strong></p> <p>I work more on the vibe, so if I can vibe with an artist out there in the UK that is making some noise and we happen to hook up, then I'm cool with that. I don't have any pre-conceived notions or plans on trying certain things. I don't ever overthink it. I just believe in good music. I don't care where your music is from, it can be from anywhere in the world. If the music is good and the vibe is good, then who knows what the future holds.</p> <p><strong>Do you feel the pressure at all when creating a new album? People are quick to start saying you fell off or should retire when you have just one bad verse\u2026</strong></p> <p>Well, I try to look at it in a positive way. I think people do hold me to a higher standard because of the level of work that I have done. I think people have double standards when it comes to my music, but for me that's the challenge of it. It's the reason to keep making music, if I was relaxed and no one was challenging or questioning me, then why do it?</p> <p><strong>Your recent verse on Mr Carter from the Lil' Wayne album says: <em>I've got so much from the rap game / now it's your go...</em> Is that you passing the baton on to Lil' Wayne as the next big MC?</strong></p> <p>I mean that to all upcoming artists. It just happened to be Wayne for that song, but it's for everybody. You know that's what Russell [Simmons] and those guys did for us. They paved the way so that we can get to our goals quicker, if it took Russell ten years then it took me and Puff five years. So hopefully it will take them two and a half. That was really a blanket statement for any upcoming artist. For Lupe, for TI, for everybody\u2026</p> <p><strong>Does it upset you when people question your loyalty or friendship? Just last week artists that you used to work with, like Tierra Marie and Foxy Brown, questioned your friendship\u2026 </strong></p> <p>That's just from being in the business so long. You know that stuff is going to happen eventually... What I am very happy about is that no matter what people say, no one has ever said that I am dishonest or that I have taken one dime from them. [Raises voice] I've never cheated anyone out of a dime. No one's ever said that, right? As far as Foxy or Tierra Marie, these are people that I have given chances to. Sometimes it don't work out. It's understandable that they would be upset, but you got to look at it [from] my point of view as well. I did give them chances. I gave Tierra Marie the same shot I gave Rihanna. Look at where Rihanna is. Look how that turned out. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't. I wish I could make every single person successful but that just is not reality. That's not even realistic. </p> <p><strong>OK, so finally, I don't want to be morbid, but if you died tomorrow, would you be happy with what you are leaving behind? Is there anything you really still want to achieve or accomplish?</strong></p> <p>Wow. Yeah, I am definitely happy with the progress that I have made in my life. I am still hungry to keep achieving more, but if anything happened today or tomorrow then I am more than happy with what I have achieved and the legacy that I would then leave... [long pause] Yeah, I can definitely say that I would be more than happy.</p> <p><em>The finale of THISDAY's festival will be held at Royal Albert Hall in London on October 14</em></p>",
  "<p>Economists were broadly in agreement that the Bank of England will cut interest rates soon, following today's quarterly inflation report.</p> <p><strong>Jonathan Loynes</strong> at <strong>Capital Economics</strong> said the report will be seen as more dovish than might have been expected given the dreadful inflation data yesterday.</p> <p>\"Most strikingly, the new forecasts show inflation falling slightly below its 2% target at the two year policy horizon and then well below it thereafter - a rather lower medium-term profile than expected in May.\"</p> <p>However, he added that the Bank was hinting at only a limited scope for rate cuts, with risks to inflation remaining on the upside.</p> <p><strong>Amit Kara</strong> at <strong>UBS</strong> that the inflation report \"opens the door for a rate cut\", and <strong>Alan Clarke</strong> at <strong>BNP Paribas</strong> said it report signalled a bias to interest rate cuts.</p> <p>However <strong>Zahra Ward-Murphy</strong> at <strong>Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein</strong> said that she thinks the Bank will continue to keep interest rates on hold until they see slowing growth impacting the inflation rate.</p> <p>\"We're probably still not looking at cuts coming through until 2009, becuase there are serious near-term upside risks (to inflation).\"</p> <p>\"(In terms of impact on interest rates) I think it's a firm on-hold until we see this sharp slowdown that they are expecting in growth start to impact on the inflation rate,\" Ward-Murphy said.</p> <p><strong>George Buckley</strong> at <strong>Deustche Bank </strong>said the financial markets would welcome the forecast of lower inflation, but cautioned that the governor had not ruled out the possibility of a recession.</p> <p><strong>Howard Archer</strong> of <strong>Global Insight</strong> said today's report made \"depressing reading\", with the Bank much more pessimistic on growth.</p> <p>\"While we would not rule out a cut in November - particularly if the economy slows markedly further and oil prices continue to retreat - we are maintaining our view that interest rates will stay at 5.00% until early 2009.

  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-336498158\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1729253109_gdn-int-080812-cb-Norway-Fishing-Boat-04-4x3.flv\"/> </video>   <p>A British trawler has sparked an international incident after being filmed taking a boatload of endangered fish caught in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea and then dumping the majority overboard in UK waters. </p> <p>Norwegian government coastguards filmed the crew of the Prolific, a Shetland-based trawler, openly discarding more than 5,000 kg of cod and other dead white fish, or nearly 80% of its catch. </p> <p>According to the coastguard, the boat had previously been inspected in Norwegian waters and declared legal, before crossing into UK waters where it dumped its load. The incident took place on 2 August but the video only came to light in Britain yesterday.</p> <p>It is illegal to discard fish in Norwegian waters, but boats are forced to do so in European Union waters if they have caught the wrong species of fish or fish that are too small. Last year the EU estimated that between 40% and 60% of all fish caught by trawlers in the North sea is discarded. The practice of dumping is widely recognised as unsustainable but inevitable given the present EU quota system. </p> <p>Yesterday, Norwegian minister for fisheries and coastal affairs Helga Pedersen, speaking to angry fishing communities in northern Norway who had seen the film, said she would press for review of the EU fishing policy and wanted to ban any boat discarding fish that were caught in Norwegian waters. </p> <p>\"Discarding fish not only means a massive waste of food and potential income, it also leads to unrecorded catches, resulting in a poorer scientific basis for our management decisions\", she said. \"I want a requirement that all fish caught in Norwegian waters, also by foreign vessels, must be taken to port, regardless of which final port is used. We will introduce new requirements, as a condition for obtaining licenses to fish, that vessels cannot discard valuable fish caught here\". </p> <p>Reidar Kaarb\u00f8, an independent analyst of Norwegian government policy said: \"This must stop now. The EU community cannot be taken seriously if it allows this kind of behaviour. This is certainly not how to manage the world's resources.\"</p> <p>UK fish experts said the practice of discarding fish was common but had rarely been so dramatically documented. Opinions were split on whether the Prolific was discarding fish for which it had no quota, or that it was \"high-grading\" its catch. This involves boats discarding low-value small fish to make room for high value larger fish. </p> <p>\"It is a disgrace. This practice is depleting populations that are already overfished and it is happening everywhere\", said Willie MacKenzie, Greenpeace fisheries campaigner. \"All of these fish are perfectly marketable, and have been legally caught. But if you are a fisherman it makes more economic sense to take boat to market with the most saleable fish, so you discard the lowest value stuff.\"</p> <p>European Union quotas strictly limit the amount of fish that ships can bring back to port, but there is no restriction on the amount of fish they can catch. <br>The current EU quota system for fish sets quotas at individual species level, which are then allocated and traded amongst individual fishermen. Often they will buy quotas out at sea once they know what they are catching. This means that it is illegal to take back to port fish they have no quota for so these fish are discarded. </p> <p>The solution, say environment groups, involves an overhaul of fisheries management, making discards illegal, and encouraging more sustainable fishing methods. </p> <p>Yesterday, the Prolific could not be contacted but the ship's agents, LHD Ltd of Lerwick, said that it was rare for it to fish in Norwegian waters. \"It is out of contact. We very rarely fish in Norwegian waters. That's the first time in years,\" said managing director Richie Simpson. \"The reason there are discards is the ridiculously low quotas. Fishermen cannot make a living with them. They are at a ridiculous level.\"</p> <p>The International council for the exploration of the sea, the leading scientific body for fisheries scientific, has repeatedly advised the EU that stocks of cod in the North Sea are much too low to be fished and has argued for no-go areas. However, every year the European government ministers override their advice and continue with a quota system.</p> <p>A spokesman for the department of the environment, food and rural affairs (Defra) said: \"Throwing dead fish back into the sea is a waste that nobody wants to see, but there is no easy answer. The UK is keen to ensure more effective and sustainable fisheries by reducing by-catch and discards, and the government is working closely with fishermen to achieve that.\"</p> <p><em>Environment blog: <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/08/fish_on_film_can_it_stop_the_w.html\">Can this film stop the waste?</a></em></p>",
  "<p><strong>Alan Clarke</strong> at <strong>BNP Paribas</strong> said the <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/business/2008/aug/13/unemploymentdata.economics\">poor labour market figures</a> would support the case for an interest rate cut from the dovish-members of the monetary policy committee.</p> <p>\"We expect the unemployment rate to rise by around 1 to 1.5 percentage points over the coming year with risks that it is even worse. The good news is that reports such as this limit the risk of an interest rate hike and brings forward the likely timing of the first interest rate cut.\"</p> <p>\"The latest UK labour market figures show that the rise in unemployment is rapidly picking up pace ... Employment is still rising - but only just,\" <strong>Vicky Redwood</strong> at <strong>Capital Economics</strong> said, adding that at least the inflationary pressures in the labour market remain benign.</p> <p><strong>David Page</strong> at <strong>Investec</strong> said that the figure showed there was no risk of second round inflation effects from wage growth and this should help bring price pressures down in the near future: \"The rise in unemployment is worse than we in the markets were expecting and shows a significant easing in the labour market. Entirely consistently with that, we are seeing a marked slowdown in average earnings. To our minds, not only is this evidence that there is no evidence of second round inflation effects in the economy, but will underpin a marked slowdown in service sector inflation as we look forward.</p> <p>He added that the weaker labour market will help push through interest rates cuts once the current spike in inflation has passed.</p> <p><strong>Howard Archer</strong> at <strong>Global Insight</strong> said the weaker wage growth reduces pressure on the Bank to raise borrowing costs to try to combat inflation: \"Ongoing muted earnings growth in June eases pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates. It is absolutely critical that earnings growth remains muted, if the eventual next move in interest rates is to be down. Any sign that higher inflation and elevated inflation expectations are feeding through to push up pay significantly would add to already significant pressure on the Bank of England to lift interest rates - despite the ever growing likelihood of recession - to try to prevent a damaging wages-price spiral developing.\"</p> <p><strong>George Buckley</strong> at <strong>Deutsche Bank </strong>said: \"It's fairly clear that the labour market is deteriorating at a rapid pace and I think it's going to continue to do so because of slower economic growth and concerns by companies that the downturn might actually be longer and more pronounced than they originally thought.\"</p>",

The meeting was attended by US-based Lucent, Sun Microsystems and Cisco, European wireless giants Nokia and Ericsson, and Canada's Nortel Networks, among many others. The main event was China's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Shield_Project\">Golden Shield Project</a> \u2013 an ambitious plan to link China's national and internet surveillance networks, public record databases, CCTV cameras, speech and face recognition databases, smart cards, credit records and a myriad of regional and national ministries. Their mission was to make the network \"see, hear and think\" in the continuing effort to solidify state control. </p> <p>Nortel Networks continues to work with the Chinese <a href=\"http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/eng/index.jsp\">Tsinghua University</a> on developing speech recognition software, often used in surveillance of telephone conversations, allowing the network to hear. It has also widely distributed its \"personal internet suite\" to providers in Shanghai, Beijing and other major Chinese cities. The software allows IPs not only to monitor what their subscribers are doing online, but to control what information is delivered to them.</p> <p>Content requested from a home computer for topics deemed undesirable will be stored against that person's personal file in numerous databases. The network rolled out with product and knowledge support from western IT firms is designed to think \u2013 that is, to identify individual subscribers when they log on, matching names to IP addresses, and learning, over time, what interests them.</p> <p>The Golden Shield Project also integrates a facial recognition system (FRS), partly developed by <a href=\"http://www.acsysbiometrics.com/\">Acsys Biometrics</a>, a Canadian company. Rolled out across closed-circuit video surveillance networks in Chinese cities, it allows the Golden Shield to see. Rick Collins, senior manager of Nortel's advanced research laboratory, ProtoNet, <a href=\"http://www.dd-rd.ca/site/publications/index.php?id=1266&amp;page=14&amp;subsection=catalogue\">said of</a> the Acsys system: \"Layering Acsys' face recognition's capabilities within Nortel Networks' solutions will make communication networks more personal. I envision a network that knows who you are, where you are and can reach you whether you're on your mobile phone or at your desktop.\"</p> <p>An enthusiastic business partner of the Chinese state apparatus has been Cisco. <a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9948331-7.html\">Notorious for</a> its several appearances before the US House of Representatives to explain their role in supplying virtually the entire hardware on which the Golden Shield Project operates, as well as multiple systems to assist Chinese ministries responsible for catching political and social dissidents and censoring the internet. In 1997, Cisco won the contract to supply internet \"firewall boxes\" and, by 2006, they supplied 60% of the Chinese market for routers, switches and other sophisticated networking gear. Its estimated annual revenue from China is $500m.</p> <p>In 2003, Cisco's \"<a href=\"http://news.zdnet.co.uk/security/0,1000000189,39272429,00.htm\">Policenet</a>\" software was rolled out as the backbone of the Chinese state security system. This software, in conjunction with Intel's fingerprint technology, is compatible with the Chinese surveillance systems and allows a policeman stopping a person on the street to scan that person's ID card and access instantly the individual's past political and social behaviour, family history and recent internet activity.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2005/07/68326\">Terry Alberstein</a>, director of corporate affairs for Cisco Systems (Asia Pacific), confirmed in 2005 that Cisco does indeed sell networking and telecommunications equipment directly to the Public Security Bureau and other law enforcement offices throughout China. Cisco recently stated that it also provides service and training to Chinese police officials. Unlike other IT companies, Cisco has signed contracts directly with Chinese public security authorities. </p> <p>It is futile to argue whether western corporations are directly responsible for the uses to which China puts their technologies. Following basic free-trade principles, products are most likely sold \"as is\" to (rather than customised for) the Chinese government or third-party resellers. However, just as in the arms trade, these practices have led to the creation of a hostile digital environment, inhabited by Da Ge (pinyin for Big Brother). Whenever we pause to discuss or protest China's decision to filter websites or jail Yahoo email account holders, we must bear in mind that the technology that has made this possible was built in our own backyard.</p>",
  "<p><br>Photograph: Luke MacGregor/Reuters</p> <p>Poor unemployment figures have put the skids under consumer stocks such as retailers and pubs. With the biggest rise in jobless numbers for more than 15 years, and a slower than expected increase in average earnings, investors are concerned the UK could slip into a sharp downturn. </p> <p>If that is the case, consumers are likely to reign in their spending even more. So pubs group <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/enterpriseinns\">Enterprise Inns</a></strong> is 38p lower at 348p, while rival <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/punchtaverns\">Punch Taverns</a></strong> is down 36.75p to 331.25p.</p> <p>Among the retailers B&amp;Q owner <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/kingfisher\">Kingfisher</a></strong> has lost 10p to 128.4p, <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marksspencer\">Marks &amp; Spencer</a></strong> is down 21.25p to 274.75p and <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/next\">Next</a></strong> has fallen 57p to \u00a310.23.</p> <p>Electrical retailer <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/dsginternational\">DSG International</a> </strong>has dropped 10.75p to 54p as it went ex-dividend and JP Morgan downgraded from neutral to underweight.</p> <p>The bank said: \"DSG shares have rallied 86% since June 7 in part on hopes it could ease its financial situation through asset sales. We believe these hopes are misplaced. Unlike Kingfisher in Italy, DSG's Spanish and Italian operations are leasehold and loss making, and operating in markets that we think are likely to </p> <p>remain challenging for some time. As opposed to selling them, we believe that DSG may have to invest in them to close or restructure.</p> <p>\"The macro environment in all of DSG's core markets continues to deteriorate and in the UK in particular we believe that gross margins will remain under pressure from negative mix as the housing market hits white good sales and the impact of recent TV promotions. We remain concerned that Back to School could herald renewed competition in laptops due to new market entrants such as Argos and Carphone Warehouse.\"</p> <p>Nick Bubb at Pali International was also negative: \"Fearful of a potential bid or break-up, the short interest has fallen from over 30% to only 20% over the last month, hence the amazing squeeze up to 65p. But the shares look very over-valued at this level and we think the shorts should hold their nerve.\"</p> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> is down 27.3 points at 5507.2, but the index has come off its worst levels as Bank of England governor Mervyn King unveils its latest inflation report.

  "<p>Pablo looked distressed. He grabbed the litre-bottle of Brahma beer and, pouring, moaned aloud: \"I can't believe it. The Len\u00e7\u00f3is have been taken off the seven wonders shortlist \u2013 all because the local government wouldn't pay the 320 reales [$199] registration fee.\"</p> <p>Pablo was my guide around S\u00e3o Luis, a colonial city on Brazil's north-eastern coast still relatively unfamiliar to European tourists. I had no idea what he was talking about. I'd also come here to see this natural wonder \u2013 the Parque Nacional dos Len\u00e7\u00f3is Maranhenses, a surreal and beautiful coastal desert of sweeping dunes where rainwater collects to create freshwater lagoons. They are just three hours south of S\u00e3o Luis and while the city is a draw in itself, the dunes are deservedly the region's top attraction.</p> <p>\"You see, they're voting for seven new world wonders, and the Len\u00e7\u00f3is national park was on the website. But the government, which spends millions of reales on parties and local events, wouldn't pay the registration fee. It looks as if Rio de Janeiro's Sugar Loaf Mountain will be entered instead.\"</p> <p>Pablo was referring not to the Unesco World Heritage scheme, but to a global election campaign to find seven new natural wonders of the world organised by a Swiss foundation-cum-enterprise. On the page relating to the <a href=\"http://www.new7wonders.com/nature/en/nominees/southamerica/c/LencoisMaranhensesNationalPark/\"> Len\u00e7\u00f3is</a>, the website advises: \"This nominee is not yet officially supported\" and it adds in capital letters: \"Without an official supporting committee (OSC), a nominee cannot participate in the next stages of the New 7 Wonders of Nature campaign.\" </p> <p>I contacted the organisation to find out if the local supporters of Len\u00e7ois had lost out simply because they hadn't paid a registration fee. Stephanie McNamara, the organisations \"communications consultant\" wrote back almost immediately to tell me I should support UK sites, enthusing \"There is no registration fee - just go ahead - vote and create an OSC.\"</p> <p>The next day I put the question to McNamara again, wondering how Pablo had got it so wrong. She explained: \"We introduced the nominal registration fee to make sure that the OSC for each nominee were serious and committed, and it also helps us defray the administrative costs. As a non-profit organisation which has never received any public funding or taxpayer's monies whatsoever, we must not only be as fiscally careful as we can, but must also ask the actual beneficiaries of the campaign to contribute at least a bit to the administrative costs.\"</p> <p>So someone or something does have to pay the sum - nominal in Europe, not so nominal in the developing world, which probably explains why many rivers, hills, beaches and waterfalls getting plenty of votes in Mongolia, Nepal, Eritrea and elsewhere remain officially unsupported.</p> <p>And that set me to wondering about wonders. Last year there was a vote for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/wonders\">seven man-made wonders of the world</a>, in which the likes of Mexico's Chitzen-Itz\u00e1, China's Great Wall and Brazil's Christ the Redeemer (Rio again) beat the Moais of Easter Island and the Statue of Liberty. Announced on July 7 2007, the \"new seven wonders\" were supposedly decided after 100 million votes were cast online. The final seven had all the authority of those lists of memorable movie scenes, all-time great pop records and unforgettable comedy moments that are churned out on British television.</p> <p>The people behind both sets of seven wonders call themselves the Seven Wonders Foundation. The foundation was set up by Bernard Weber, a Swiss-born Canadian, who, the website informs us, \"has had a varied career as a filmmaker, museum curator, aviator, and explorer\". While the organisation claims its main purpose is to protect buildings and the environment, Weber \u2013 in his <a href=\"http://www.new7wonders.com/n7w/new7news/questions_answers_070708/\">7 answers to 7 questions</a> \u2013 says, \"So far, we have made enough money to cover our main costs, which is very positive since many good ideas often fall apart because of insufficient funding. And it is our intention to continue to grow our revenues in the future, for example through sponsor and licensing partnerships, and indeed to make much more so that we can generate a surplus to support the important objectives of the New7Wonders Foundation.\" </p> <p>At which point, one has to ask if Pharaoh Khufu had to register the pyramids to get them into the original list of seven wonders? Did the gardener who liked to hang his creative genius around Babylon pay 199 gold coins to get the recognition he deserved? </p> <p>Some Brazilian news media, such as the local news website Zill, are saying that the Len\u00e7\u00f3is were left out because of a <a href=\"http://zill.brasilportais.com.br/geral/lencois-maranhenses-podem-sair-de-disputa-mundial-30590.html\">bureaucratic loophole</a>. But if Pablo is right, and the local government didn't fancy paying to be part of some completely random, ultimately commercial ranking, then I entirely sympathise. When I checked the website, I found that 10 of the top 25 entries on the shortlist still have no official committee to back them. The UK had no sites being sponsored at all. One is left to assume that either apathy rules or countries are too proud to enter a raffle for greatness.</p> <p>When I went to the Len\u00e7\u00f3is, there were roughly 50 people wandering around the edge of this 270-sq-km park. There was plenty of space and I was able to go for a swim in my very own private lagoon \u2013 cool water, cloudless skies, not even the sound of anyone else splashing. This, I reflected, is what wonder is about \u2013 and experiences, whether on our travels or at home, should be measured according to personal delight, and not because that sector of society that has access to the internet, likes to vote and believes lists really matter, condescends to determine what is and isn't wonderful.</p> <p>The new seven wonders of nature will be announced in 2010.</p>",

He told Human Rights Watch that the vast majority of the residents, including his family, fled the village when active fighting between Georgian forces and South Ossetian militias broke out on August 8, but he decided to stay to look after the cattle.

  "<p>One of the great things about traveling is that you pick up on things that the guidebooks and the seasoned experts never tell you about. I've just spent three weeks touring northern California and, along with my family, we were all struck by one wonderful fact. Cleanliness. There was no litter. Not in the public transport system, <a href=\"http://www.bart.gov/\">Bart</a>, serving the San Francisco Bay area, nor in the national parks of Yosemite, Lake Tahoe, the Redwoods of Muir Forest, nor the pristine Tomales Bay of Marin county. Even though a baseball game at the San Francisco Giants stadium turned into a huge fast food munch-in, the debris was minimal. </p> <p>At Lake Merritt, in gritty Oakland, where we passed some hours at its sweet children's theme park, Fairyland, the lunch-time trash was carefully deposited, parents carefully collecting children's Coke cans. Now I arrive home to find that American-born Bill Bryson is <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7554237.stm\">lecturing Britain</a> about being a nation of disgusting <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2523927/Bill-Bryson-attacks-litter-bugs-and-fly-tippers-trashing-Britain.html\">fly-tipping litterbugs</a>. How right he is. </p> <p>But I think there are profound cultural differences. First, fines and enforcement. I was so struck by the complete lack of litter, that I asked a recently retired state trooper from Pleasanton, in the Bay area, why this should be. He said that the prominently displayed warnings, of a $1,000 fine for litter across the state, was one reason - he had handed out plenty of fines in his time. Yet there were no litter warnings or state troopers around on the shores of Lake Tahoe, a Sierra Nevada gem, which were infested, daily, with families obsessively conducting barbeques. In Yosemite, more than two million people visit its valley areas, lakes, waterfalls and viewing points, which were all clean as a whistle. In part, perhaps, this urge to clear up in national parks is driven by personal safety; a fear of wild bears (we saw four). Everywhere there are warnings to place litter (as well as food) in bear-proof receptacles. </p> <p>But there is also, I suspect, a deeply inbred respect, within the American psyche, for its fantastic natural environment. A shared pride in some of the most pristine and magnificent countryside in the world. To this Briton's eye, I'd also note that this wilderness is accessible - a week's family car pass to Yosemite is just $20, and camping is cheap to free. </p> <p>The park also operates a free junior ranger programme for children, every morning, on a different topic natural environment, plus evening campfires. A family can hire a fully equipped campsite (tent, table, chairs etc) for $20 a night. American parents of modest means said they were returning, after coming as children to camp with their parents. This is something the National Trust might study, to our national benefit. For sure, Americans eat far too much, they're in the grip of an obesity crisis, are totally dependent on cars, and are embarrassingly prone to flying the stars and stripes at their gates and drives. But they certainly have far more respect for their open and <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/columnists/brian-viner/brian-viner-i-always-used-to-tackle-the-litter-louts-but-no-longer-ndash-i-am-just-too-scared-891447.html\">public spaces</a> than we do here. </p> <p>That's why it takes a more <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/panorama/7543554.stm\">sensitive American eye</a> to point out a horrible home truth - our mounting squalor. The only thing I would say in our defence is that I usually spend August not in California, but in southern Italy, well south of Naples. Believe me, the Italians I encounter are even more messy in their public places - especially the beaches - than Britons, though I've never really worked out why that should be.</p>",

The Waterloo ad was created by the agency Kitcatt Nohr Alexander Shaw.</p> <p>WWF lodged a complaint with the Advertising Standards Authority about a national press ad that Shell launched in the FT in February.</p> <p>The ad opens with the headline \"We invest today's profits in tomorrow's solutions\".</p> <p>In the ad, Shell talks of the need to invest in technology to \"continue to secure a profitable and sustainable future\". </p> <p>Shell also said that in the race to find more energy to fuel global demand there was a need to \"find new ways of managing carbon emissions to limit climate change\".</p> <p>The FT ad gave examples included Shell building the biggest refinery in the US, \"exploring a new generation of bio fuels\", and unlocking \"the potential of the vast Canadian oil sands deposit\".</p> <p>WWF complained to the ASA that Shell's Canadian oil sand operation and building the biggest US refinery - actually an expanded redevelopment of an existing facility at Port Arthur in Texas - does not help provide a sustainable future or sustainable energy production.</p> <p>Shell argued that to meet vast energy requirements it had to look beyond conventional sources of oil and gas, \"but also the development of vast resources of unconventional oil and gas, such as oil sands\".</p> <p>The ASA said that the use of the word \"sustainable\" throughout the ad was defined as \"primarily in environmental terms\".</p> <p>Because Shell had not provided evidence that it was \"effectively\" managing carbon emissions from its oil sands projects \"in order to limit climate change\", the ASA deemed that the ad was misleading.</p> <p>The ASA came to the same conclusion about Shell's claims about the redevelopment of the Port Arthur oil refinery and said it should not be shown again in its current form.</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediaguardian.co.uk\">editor@mediaguardian.co.uk</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

The Guardian Olympic space station is ready to beam all the relevant and irrelevant information straight into your lap on Day 5 of the Games. We'll keep you up to date with all the breaking news and there will be blogs aplenty stuffed with comment on what's hot in Beijing.</p> <p>We have got Mr Phelps going for gold No4 in the <strong>200m butterfly</strong> at 3.21am, plus more <strong>badminton</strong> and <strong>boxing</strong>, including the big boys of the super heavyweight. Whither Audley Harrison? There's also beach volleyball (no sniggering), table tennis, weightlifting, rowing and what could be the first clash of a new cold war as the US and China women's gymnasts go for the team gold. Blood on the dancefloor...</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>2.20am:</strong></p> <p><strong>Brings a tear to your eye...</strong></p> <p>Brits on show today include the returning <strong>Nicole Cooke</strong>, who is going for her second gold of the Games, this time in the women's time trial starting at 4.30am. Stephen Cummings is in the men's trial which starts at 10.10am, but hopefully I'll be tucked up in bed by then so I'll have to catch up on what happened on the super soar-away rebranded Guardian website.</p> <p>The Great Britain men's four go in their semi-finals and the single sculler Alan Campbell is also in his semi. <strong>Caitlin McClatchey</strong> is our big muscular hope in the pool for the final of the 200m women's freestyle</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>2.28am:</strong> Oh and our sailing heroes are back too. <strong>Ben Ainslie</strong> in the Finn and <strong>Sarah Ayton, Sarah Webb and Pippa Wilson</strong> in the Yngling are out on the water again after a rest day.</p> <p>There'll be more sitting down on horses too, as Jane Gregory and Emma Hindle begin day one of <strong>the dressage</strong>. From the genteel to the beautifully brutal as <strong>David Price</strong> faces a tough test in the super-heavyweight class against Islam Timurziev of Russia. Getting stronger...</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>2.38am:</strong> I've been reminded to ask you to have a punt against the Guardian sports desk's very own <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/poll/2008/aug/12/olympicsequestrian.olympics2008\">betting rat</a>, Balco. Pit your wits against this murine shrewdie as he tries to earn some bunce on equestrianism</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>2.48am:</strong> Mr Phelps is also going for his fifth gold in the <strong>4x200m freestyle</strong>. One wonders if tiredness will become a factor by the end of the day.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>2.55am:</strong> The mails are flooding in about the comments of the Australian Olympic chairman <strong>John Coates</strong>. Apparently the personal hygiene of the British swimmers leaves a little to be desired. Surely Australian <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob1rYlCpOnM\">swimming pools</a> have dirty plasters, veruca socks and wee wee in them too? Remember - no diving or running. And as for petting...</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>3.05am:</strong> Alain Bernard of France (he's a monster) breaks the world record for the 100m freestyle in the first semi with 47.2s.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>3.09am:</strong> I'm like, wow. Bernard held the record for about three minutes. <strong>Eamon Sullivan</strong> of Australia wins the second 100m freestyle semi-final in 47.05s. Wonder if he is related to the Sullivans I saw on the telly in the 1980s? Oh hang on. They weren't real.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>3.13am:</strong> \"Sadly I can reliably inform you that most of the public pools in Sydney fall somewhere between immaculate and stunning - it's the Aussies who swim in them that are the problem,\" says Alexander Pace.

Looking forward to spending a few hours with you this evening and getting caught up in the morning when I get up,\" says Nicola Douglas.</p> <p>I feel like a late night DJ here. Donald Fagen anyone?</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>3.17am:</strong> Britain's <strong>Caitlin McClatchey</strong> comes in sixth in the women's 200m freestyle. The winner is Italy's first women's gold in the pool, Federica Pelegrini, who also takes the world record.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>3.20am:</strong> It's all about the pool here. Phelps is getting ready for his latest tilt at glory in the 200m butterfly. Ironic that, as I'm feeling quite nervous.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>3.25am:</strong> He's done it. <strong>Michael Phelps</strong> makes history by winning his fourth gold of this Games and his 10th gold overall - more than anyone else in history - in the 200m butterfly. Oh and he broke the world record again. I'm going to get one of those suits...</p> <p>Speaking of the 1980s, Phelps reminds me of a certain gold-winning otter from the great and forgotten film <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldLMm59YTnA\">Animalympics</a></p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>3.30am:</strong> If you think Phelps has created a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/12/3\">big stink</a>, check this out</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>3.31am:</strong> Britain's <strong>Jemma Lowe</strong> comes third in the first women's 200m butterfly semi-final, despite leading for most of the race.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>3.37am:</strong> The second semi of the 200m butterfly is so fast Lowe is squeezed out into ninth and so misses the final. China's <strong>Liu Zige</strong> wins the race in front of <strong>Jessicah Schipper</strong> of Australia.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>3.40am:</strong> \"Here on the West Coast of the United States, NBC has made the decision not to show the swimming finals live even though the current time is after 7pm. Everybody's home from work and turning on their televisions like true patriots only to find that Inside Edition (a magazine show) takes precedence over this landmark event. I'll have to tune back in in a few hours to see if by the magic of tape delay he actually only takes the bronze,\" writes Michael Day. Oh those pesky schedulers. What are they showing instead? When Windows Won't Open or Celebrity Chair Swap?</p> <p>PS British TV is just as bad. It's nothing personal.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>3.43am:</strong> Meanwhile China's incredibly small gymnasts are really going for it (technical term) at the <strong>National Indoor Stadium</strong>. The US team usurped their rivals at the World Championships last year and now it's payback time. Or might be.</p> <p>I can't get used to stadium names without sponsors. We in the decadent West demand endorsements with our sport. How about the Ribena Arena? All smart arse suggestions welcome.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>3.53am:</strong> \"I think I have a loaf of bread in my bread bin older than the smallest Chinese girl,\" says Nicola Douglas.

I'm begging you. Let's live together in peace.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>3.57am:</strong> \"From a Brit in Australia's perspective it's completely buggered up my schedule as all the finals are during the working day and the heats are on when I get in from work.

The race is won by Canada's Mike Brown sporting a truly naff tattoo of a maple leaf above the five rings. \"Oh Canada...\"</p> <p>Breaking news...Phelps complains of water getting into his goggles and affecting his performance. A bad workman blames his tools, Michael.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>4.04am:</strong> \"Morning George, what's happened to Robin? Did the Guardian give him the boot after yesterdays badminton fiasco?\" So says Steve George, the self-styled \"only Englishman in an all Chinese office, Beijing.\"</p> <p>Nah, they didn't sack Robin (whoever he is). I'm just slumming it for a a couple of hours.</p> <p>I'm looking at <strong>Phelps on the podium</strong> and I've noticed he has a <strong>very small chin</strong>.

The gold goes to Australia and <strong>Stephanie Rice</strong> and the silver to <strong>Kirstie Coventry</strong> of Zimbabwe. That's three silvers for Coventry. Every time I think of Coventry I think of the west Midlands toilet. Mind you, there was the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBT4-jjiMyg\">1987 FA Cup final</a></p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>4.24am:</strong> The US team are making fun of the other countries <strong>4x200m freestyle relay</strong>. They look three seconds or so ahead of the world record. At least the Brits are in the mix for a medal...</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>4.29am:</strong> <strong>Michael Phelps</strong> in still on course for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfbcBB05nQg\">Mark Spitz</a>'s record after winning his fifth gold with the US 4x200m freestyle relay team in a world record time of 6min 58.56sec. As Darth Vader would say: \"all too easy\". The plucky Brits came sixth in a new British record (three of them are Scots).</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>4.36am:</strong> Six world records have been broken in the pool today. Flipping amazing.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>4.38am:</strong> China are out in front in the <strong>women's team gymnastics</strong>. They lead by over a full point from the US, who are themselves three points ahead of Russia. I think the BBC's gymnastics commentators are without doubt the most annoying on TV. The woman sounds like the PA announcer in a supermarket.</p> <p>Oh dear. One of the Chinese girls, Li Shanshan, fell off the beam, which could let the US back into the hunt for gold.</p> <p>While we're at it, here's another clip from <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox0eIylJ_OE\">Animalympics</a> with gymnastics.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>4.56am:</strong> Time for a quick update. In cycling the women's time trial is underway and Britain's <strong>Emma Pooley</strong> is off and running.</p> <p>You would think there would be someone in Britain who can use an epee or a foil - well <strong>Richard Kruse</strong> has beaten Romania's Virgil Saliscan 15-6 in the first round of the <strong>men's individual foil</strong>. He will now face the German world champion Peter Joppich. Mmmm, it brings to mind a scene from the movie <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CL8mh_4-0s\">The Life and death of Colonel Blimp</a></p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>5am:</strong> \"Ahhh!

He lost 105-104 to Finland's Matti Hatava. Bummer.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>5.12am: </strong>Right, thanks, George. Looks like I'm taking over at a crucial point in the gymnastics. Let me know what you're thinking about; ideas, musings and general nonsense all allowed.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>5.15am: </strong>So what else is going on?

The women's team have just triumphed over the USA. Alicia Sacramone has a face like thunder. Romania get the bronze</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>5.22am: </strong><strong>Nicole Cooke</strong> has just set off in the <strong>women's time trial</strong>.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>5.25am: </strong>Where are you Andrew Jolley? Yesterday you promised me an elaborate spreadsheet that would show me the best performing nation in proportion to its population.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>5.28am: </strong><strong>Softball </strong>Good work Pep apparently: \"USA v Australia\u2026 scores still nil all after one innings each...nailbiting stuff.\"</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>5.30am: </strong><strong>Archery</strong>we're not doing very well in this event are we. Larry Godfrey was beaten 114-109 by Russian Bair Badenov. It's strange, archery is the kind of old-fashioned sport I'd have thought Britain would excel at.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>5.36am: </strong><strong>Cycling </strong>I don't want to tempt fate, but Emma Pooley is looking very good.

Good news, but she was so close to a gold.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>5.57am: </strong>Steve George sees <strong>gymnastics </strong> as a metaphor for world conflict: \"Does anyone else see something prophetic in the gymnastic three-way-super-power podium finish? \" There's just one flaw to your dystopian future, plucky Romania grabbed the bronze.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>6.00am: </strong>Kyla Wall-Polin tells me that its still all square in the <strong>softball</strong>. And you lucky Americans you can watch it on NBC (well the internet).</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>6.01am: </strong>Chilsey's back on the Beeb, always a good thing. Although he is becoming a little bit ubiquitous...</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>6.04am: </strong><strong>Softball</strong> still 0-0 in the fourth. The tension is killing me, who's going to step up and break the deadlock?</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>6.05am: </strong><strong>Cycling</strong> Nicole Cooke you are still a hero. 15th place is no disgrace, especially after your previous exploits.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>6.06am: </strong>More bat and ball news in the <strong>baseball</strong> Chinese Taipei beat Netherlands 5-0. Sounds like a thrashing.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>6.09am: </strong><strong>Breaking news</strong> a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/13/olympics2008.chinathemedia\">British journalist has been arrested in Beijing</a>.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>6.12am: </strong><strong>Fencing</strong> Ohhh so close. Richard Kruse goes down 10-9 to German world champion Peter Joppich. What a great effort.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>6.13am: </strong>I'm getting a flood of <strong>Greco-Roman wrestling</strong> results, but it's all so confusing, the only reference point I've got is AC Slater from US comedy Saved By the Bell.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>6.17am: </strong><strong>Judo </strong>It escaped me earlier but Winston Gordon was beaten by Khurshid Nabiev. Winston Gordon, possibly the most British sounding name at the Olympics.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>6.20am: </strong>More proper news - <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/13/olympics2008.olympicscycling\">Emma Pooley bags silver</a>.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>6.23am: </strong>Al Parkes wonders: Are certain swimming races (e.g breaststroke) the only races where contestants have to get as quickly as they can, under their own steam, from a to b by using a sub optimal method for the distance to be covered?\" Err no, I'm afraid not Al, have you never marveled at the 10, 20 and 50km walks?</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>6.26am: </strong><strong>Softball </strong>Kyla is going crazy...and the reason? The USA have scored a run in the bottom of the 5th. Can Australia respond?</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>6.33am: </strong>Right it's quiet at the moment, so I've got time to tell you what's going on later today. Stephen Cummings will try and follow Emma Pooley's lead, when he competes in the <strong>men's time trial</strong>. There's some British interest in the <strong>rowing</strong>, the Murray's are in <strong>tennis</strong> action and the <strong>men's hockey</strong> team see if they can follow up on their win against Pakistan when they face the Netherlands.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>6.40am: </strong> Read about how <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/13/olympicsgymnastics.olympics20081\">China's women triumphed over the Americans</a>.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>6.44am: </strong><strong>Water polo</strong> Kyle Hauptman reckons that there's a possible upset on the cards as Australia are beating Hungary 4-3.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>6.46am: </strong><strong>Shooting </strong> Mongolia's Gundegmaa Otryad will take a three-point-lead into the women's 25m pistol final. They'll be cheering on the street of Ulan Bator if she can hold on.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>6.52am: </strong><strong>Women's volleyball</strong> The USA now top Group A after beating Venezuela 3-1.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>6.58am: </strong><strong>Softball </strong>I've been on tenterhooks but Kyla has told me that: \"The USA has beaten Australia 3-0. A very good game, well-played by both sides.\" I only wish I could have been there.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>7.00am: </strong>Matt Baker has double-twisted his way into the BBC studio. Naturally he's as excited as ever.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>7.02am: </strong>Some results for you to cast your mince pies over. <strong>Women's basketball</strong> Russia 71-65 Belarus, Spain 74-55 Czech Republic. <strong>Men's hockey</strong> Australia 10-0 South Africa, South Korea 5-2 China. <strong>Softball </strong>China 7-1 Venezuela.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>7.08am: </strong><strong>Cycling </strong>One thing that may have been missed in all the excitement over Emma Pooley was Jeannie Longo's performance. At the ripe old age of 49 she missed out on a medal by just two seconds. Crikey!</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>7.12am: </strong>An update on a right ding-dong battle in the <strong>women's water polo</strong>. Australia and Hungary tied 7-7, with the eastern Europeans grabbing the equaliser with just four seconds left. Thanks Kyle in Sydney.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>7.18am: </strong> Dan Timbers doesn't share my love of softball: \"It's not a sport, its rounders for fatties,\" he scoffs.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>7.20am: </strong><strong>Cycling </strong>More good news for Team GB Steve Cummings currently has the fastest time in the <strong>men's time trial</strong>. He couldn't could he?</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>7.33am: </strong> <strong>Diving</strong> Over in the Water Cube the men's 3m synchro final is underway. The Australian pair have just gone, and to my untrained eyes that looked a bit out of sync.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>7.39am: </strong><strong>Diving </strong>After round one the British pair of Nick Robinson-Baker and Ben Swain lie in fourth place. That's not bad, but it's early days yet.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>7.42am: </strong><strong>Cycling </strong>John Ogmore doesn't share my positive views on Steve Cummings: \"A top 15 place would be a good result - I wouldn't be surprised to see him at least two to three minutes down on the winner.\" Can we all try and be a bit more optimistic please.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>7.45am: </strong>Everyone who keeps emailing to tell me to stop jinxing British athletes - consider me reprimanded.</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>8.00am: </strong>Back to the <strong>diving</strong> after round three the British pair have dropped to fifth</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>8.20am:</strong> Hello. Apologies for the little break there - not so easy to post when our building's internet has stopped working. Still, hopefully the delay has built the anticipation nicely - both for my grand arrival and the crucial final round of the men's 3m synchronised dive.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>8.24am:</strong> <strong>Diving</strong> While we were away Britain's Nick Robinson-Baker and Ben Swain dropped all the way to seventh. They're still there with one round to go, but after a moderately impressive effort in round five, they are now only 11 points between them and second. They're still not going to win a medal, but we can at least pretend to be excited, can't we?</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>8.27am:</strong> <strong>Diving</strong> The Brits have had their last go, which looked good to me, but then I am speaking as a man for whom \"doing a bomb\" represents the height of springboard-to-water sophistication.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>8.30am:</strong> It's a gold medal! For China's Chen Ying in the <strong>pistol shooting</strong>. Our divers are still on course for second last. Mongolia's Gundegmaa Otryad and Germany's Munkhbayer Dorjsuren pick up silver and bronze in the shooting.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>8.34am:</strong> <strong>Diving</strong> And another gold for China as they hold off Russia and Ukraine at the Bird's Nest. That makes 16 now.</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>8.40am:</strong> Great news - <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/13/olympics20084\">this morning's Beijinger has landed</a>. Elsewhere, <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/13/georgia_and_russia_throw_sand.html\"> Lawrence Donegan has the lowdown on the most politically-charged game of beach volleyball ever - Georgia v Russia</a>, while <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/13/phelps_stakes_his_claim_for_ti.html\">Paul Kelso is already wondering if Michael Phelps can go on to win another eight gold medals at London 2012</a>.</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>8.48am: Equestrianism</strong> I knew that he fancied himself as a cricketer, but after hearing of his Olympic bronze medal this morning, I have to ask - <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/13/olympics2008.olympicsequestrian\">is there nothing Phil Neville can't do</a>?</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>8.50am:</strong> Al Parkes has wasted no time reading the Beijinger. \"Andy Bull says, Phelps 'didn't seem to break sweat' - but how on earth could he tell?\" Don't question Bull, he has magic powers.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>8.57am:</strong> A spot of confusion is afoot. \"Re. your 8.34 entry 'another gold for China as they hold off Russia and Ukraine at the Bird's Nest'. Is the Bird's Nest one of these Olympic sports for Johnny Foreigner that we don't really get here in Britain,\" asks Bruce Jackson. \"Like Handball or Softball?\" Well softball's easy Bruce - think rounders only with everyone taking it <em>really</em> seriously. The Bird's Nest, on the other hand, is the Olympics venue that houses the running track and not, in fact, the venue I meant to refer to. I had meant to say \"the Water Cube\" - which is where all the Olympic pools are.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>9.07am: rowing</strong> An absolutely storming comeback from Britain's Alan Campbell in the men's singles sculls semi-finals - he was some way back in fourth going into the last 100m, yet heaved his way up into second by the end to make the final. New Zealand's Mahe Drysdale - three-time world champion and favourite for the gold - barely makes the final after <em>just</em> hanging on to third. The Czech Republic's Ondrej Synek was first.</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>9.15am: archery</strong> Britain's Alan Wills is up against Italy's Mauro Nespoli in the men's individual archery ... I'm so conflicted. Elsewhere, in the women's 69kg <strong>weightlifting</strong>, China's Liu Chunhong if China has just broken the world record for the snatch twice - lifting 125kg, then 128kg.</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>9.18am:</strong> One of the more entertaining aspects of the rowing is the posse of spectators at Shunyi who seem to have shown up on bikes so they can pedal alongside and keep up. \"I genuinely don't see why people don't play handball,\" parps Rob Evans. \"My girlfriend plays for her uni team and its like basketball without the hoops crossed with rugby with a goal. If you're good at either sport, then you'll be good at handball. All the guys on the men's team are 6ft plus, Eastern European and scare me.\"</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>9.24am: archery</strong> Alan Wills has beaten Mauro Nespoli in the archery and is through to the last 16. I'm crying and cheering inside all at the same time.</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>9.27am: cycling</strong> Britain's Steve Cummings is third in this morning's time-trial standings so far, but he'd be lucky to hold onto bronze at this stage, given the pace others - Tour de France runner-up Cadel Evans and 2007 Tour winner Alberto Contador among them - have been showing.</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>9.32am:</strong> \"The cyclists at Shunyi are not spectators, they're coaches,\" chips in Joanne Harris, a New Zealander who is apparently finding this morning's racing \"a bit stressful\". \"Every regatta (even little club ones) has cyclists on the bank. It's the only way a coach can watch the whole 2k race.\" Cheers for the pointer - but are there not even <em>a few</em> fans in there? If not then the rowers in that last race must've had about six coaches each ...</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>9.37am: tennis</strong> Rafael Nadal is 3-2 down to Igor Andreev in the first set of their third round match, but it's with serve so far.</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>9.43am:</strong> Joanne Harris has emailed back to let me know that she is not a New Zealander, but merely <em>in</em> New Zealand right now. Noted. Richard Smyth, meanwhile, has something to get off his chest. \"A thought on Michael Phelps: doesn't the fact that one man can win eight golds - or, for that matter, that Mark Spitz could win seven - suggest that the events into which the sport is divided aren't really appropriate? Surely the purpose of dividing up a sport into events is to reward a range of different skills and/or physical attributes, as with running or boxing. If one guy can do them all, it suggests to me all the events are rewarding pretty much the same skills. Of course, this takes nothing away from Phelps' achievements, but it seems a bit odd. The same thing strikes me about wheelchair athletics - fair play to Tanni Grey-Thompson, but if one person can win both a marathon and a sprint at the highest level then something's up.\" I actually do take your point to an extent here - Phelps' achievements are undoutedly incredible, but all this talk of \"the greatest Olympian\" does - to my mind - slightly miss the mark, as there are plenty of athletes who do not have the opportunity to compete for so many medals in their respective disciplines.</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>9.47am: rowing</strong> Britain's Matthew Wells and Stephen Rowbotham have finished third in their semi-final in the men's double sculls, meaning they make the final, but will be given an outside lane. Their time was actually better than that with which Australia won the other semi.</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>9.55am: rowing</strong> And now Britain romp home first in the semi-finals of the men's four. Australia and France will join them in the final after finishing second and third respectively. Ian Renwick has confirmed for me that it is possible to hire out bikes at Shunyi - for free!</p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>10am:</strong> \"Working less than 5 minutes walk from work meant I walked home to watch the rowing semi-finals,\" chimes David Johnson. \"However, in South Africa today there were two channels showing the same boxing match, one channel on weightlifting and one channel inexplicably showing a still camera image of the wrestling arena where there was not a competitor in sight - so what is going on in the rowing?\" Erm, fairly sure I've covered all the Brits so far ... anyone else you were worried about?</p> <!-- Block 103 --> <p><strong>10.02am:</strong> Switzerland's Fabian Cancellara grabs the gold in the men's time-trial - a clear 33 seconds faster than runner-up Gustav Larsson, of Sweden. USA's Levi Leipheimer finished third, while Team GB's Steve Cummings won't draw coverage in any other country after pootling home in 11th.</p> <!-- Block 104 --> <p><strong>10.04am:</strong> The United States' Michael Orozco has earned himself a straight red card in the third minute of their men's soccerball preliminary against Nigeria. In the style of a certain Mr Wenger I, err, did not see the incident, but I believe it involved a flailing arm connecting with an opponent's face. A draw here would be enough for USA to qualify, but would mean Nigeria could still be caught by Holland.</p> <!-- Block 105 --> <p><strong>10.10am:</strong> \"Why is everyone knocking Michael Phelps,\" demands David Brigden. \"Let's not take anything away from his achievements, whether it's doggy paddle, with eyes shut or whatever other style, in a short time span he is qualifying, competing and winning these events in world record times. The greatest ever? In his own words 'no', but the most decorated olympian ... A resounding 'yes'.\"</p> <!-- Block 106 --> <p><strong>10.12am:</strong> Slovenia, the Czech Republic and Germany take first, second and third in the second semi-final in the men's four. The British crew's time in the first semi was a good two seconds faster than that posted by Slovenia, so the Beeb has wasted no time in annointing us as gold medal winners in waiting.</p> <!-- Block 107 --> <p><strong>10.16am: archery</strong> Alan Wills has beaten another Italian - Marco Galiazzo - and is consequently through to the last 16, where he will face Cuba's Juan Carlos Stevens on Friday.</p> <!-- Block 108 --> <p><strong>10.22am: tennis</strong> Rafael Nadal is 6-4, 2-0 up against Igor Andreev in the third round of the men's singles. This one's very much over.</p> <!-- Block 109 --> <p><strong>10.26am:</strong> Some sailboat fun for you. When I say \"fun\", I really mean \"results\". Britain's Nick Rogers and Joe Glanfield finished ninth and sixth in races today and are up to third in the men's 470. You can stop worrying about the women's 470, though, after Christina Bassadone and Saskia Clark finished 15th and 13th in to finish the day in 11th. Do likewise for men's 49er team Stevie Morrison and Ben Rhodes, who are now eighth - in good part because they were disqualified for a false start in race seven. Paul Goodison, meanwhile, was fourth in Athens but sits seventh here after finishing 15th in his third race.</p> <!-- Block 110 --> <p><strong>10.30am:</strong> \"I saw Eddie the Eagle Edwards doing a personal appearance at the Big Chill festival last week and I'm sure he was wearing a piece of tinsel wound his neck,\" honks Chris Riley. \"That makes him the most decorated Olympian I have ever seen!\" I'm going to give the benefit of the doubt here and assume Chris has been up all night watching Olympic rounders.</p> <!-- Block 111 --> <p><strong>10.35am:</strong> USA v Nigeria is still 0-0 despite some enthusiastic trumpet and drum playing in the stands. If I were you, I'd take this moment to check out <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2008/aug/11/olympics20081?picture=336497775\">our gallery of the funniest pictures of the day from Beijing</a>.</p> <!-- Block 112 --> <p><strong>10.44am: rowing</strong> Great Britain's women's eight are off to a bad start in the repechage at Shunyi. They need to finish in the top four to make the final ...</p> <!-- Block 113 --> <p><strong>10.46am: rowing</strong>... which they do comfortably enough in the end, finishing third behind Canada and Holland. Australia also make it through, but Germany, whose rowers have been having a stinker across the board here so far, are out after coming in fifth.</p> <!-- Block 114 --> <p><strong>10.55am:</strong> France have their tenth medal - and their first gold - after Steeve Guenot beat Kyrgyzstan's Kanatbek Begaliev in the men's 66kg Greco-Roman wrestling. Fiona Pennie is up shortly in the women's K1 <strong>kayaking</strong> heats and needs either some serious improvement, some help from her opponents or both to make the semi-finals after finishing 19th in the first heat. She needs to make the top 15 to go through.</p> <!-- Block 115 --> <p><strong>11.02am:</strong> Now I'm no kayaking expert, but I'm fairly confident that flipping upside down (yes, yes - \"capsizing\") is not good, and that's what just happened to Aleksandra Perova. I'm fairly sure that's good news for Pennie, who's up right now.</p> <!-- Block 116 --> <p><strong>11.04am:</strong> A much better run from Pennie, but she still picked up four seconds in penalties, so it's going to be tight. I'll keep you posted when everyone else has finished, but in the meantime I can tell you that Team GB's three blondes of sailing - Sarah Ayton, Sarah Webb and Pippa Wilson have finished second in race seven of the Yngling and remain top of the standing, as does Ben Ainslie in the Finn after a second-place finish of his own. The rest of today's sailing has been postponed due to low visibility.</p> <!-- Block 117 --> <p><strong>11.09am:</strong> It's not looking good for Pennie - she's 15th with two others still to go.</p> <!-- Block 118 --> <p><strong>11.12am:</strong> Yup, Pennie's out, which is rather disappointing for the woman who was the fifth-highest ranked of any of the entrants into this year's competition. Still, it's not all bad - in a matter of minutes you'll be treated to some superlative web-based text commentary from Howard Swains, who will be taking over this gig as soon as he's done doing whatever it is that he's currently doing.</p> <!-- Block 119 --> <p><strong>11.15am:</strong> Looks like whatever it is that Howard is doing will take a while longer, so here's an email from a man known only as \"Dave\". \"If only the soft/hand/volleyball was as entertaining as your updates,\" he flatters. \"The Olympic TV coverage (as mentioned at 10am) in SA would have us believe that this is the school-yard world championships. Let the next Olympics get back to reality, chuck the tennis, baseball, football &amp; hockey - we get enough of those already - and just make it 8 days of track &amp; field, swimming, gymnastics and table tennis. OK, and trampoline.\"</p> <!-- Block 120 --> <p><strong>11.22am:</strong> Those, who - unlike Dave - are feeling starved of football in right now could do a lot worse than perusing <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/13/premier_league_preview_no15_st.html\"> Rob Smyth's excellent Premier League preview piece on Stoke City</a>. Soccerball fans may be more excited/upset to hear that USA are 1-0 down to Nigeria. Holland are currently drawing 0-0 with Japan in the other match in that group, so as it stands both USA and Nigeria go through, but if Holland scored now then USA would be going out.</p> <!-- Block 121 --> <p><strong>11.30am</strong> Right, Howard's here, and I\"m off. Cheers for all your emails - keep sending them on to Howard at <a href=\"mailto:hswains@gmail.com\">hswains@gmail.com</a></p> <!-- Block 122 --> <p><strong>11.37am:</strong> Hello folks, this is the first time I've ever been the fourth man in a four-man byline.</p> <!-- Block 123 --> <p><strong>11.40am:</strong> Sam Morgan from Cardiff gets a mention simply because he's the first into my inbox. \"Where and when will GB win their next medal????\" he asks, the four question marks surprisingly threatening. Well, I don't know when Sam, but I'm confidently predicting Beijing for the where.</p> <!-- Block 124 --> <p><strong>11.45am:</strong> The television coverage has now moved away from re-runs of the Georgian beach-volleyball victory and into the swimming pool, where they're...swimming. Fran Halsall, of Team GB!, leads after 50m in the 100m freestyle, and she's still there at the end. A heat victory for the Brit, in a time that is described as \"good\".</p> <!-- Block 125 --> <p><strong>11.50am:</strong> Kevin Mackenzie, who is one letter away from being the former Sun editor, gotchas: \"Dave's use of the word trampoline (11:15am) has had the effect of my not being able to think about anything but the episode of The Simpsons where Homer buys one but calls it a 'tramamampoline'. Which, now I see them both written down, looks no less ridiculous.\" Funny, because as I read that, I was looking at Sharon Davies on the television, who is kind of Simpson-esque under the peculiar yellow lights in the swimming pool on the telly.</p> <!-- Block 126 --> <p><strong>11.53am:</strong> The first heats of the women's 100m freestyle are over and Britain's Fran Halsall cruised into the semi-finals fifth fastest. Her sub-54 seconds time is excellent, apparently.</p> <!-- Block 127 --> <p><strong>11.59am:</strong> As ever at the Games, there are about 30 events going on at any one time which, thanks to the internet, we can know about but struggle to follow with only one pair of eyes. Still, at half-time in the football, Cameroon and Italy are 0-0; Korea lead Honduras 1-0; and Holland lead Japan 1-0. Later on, we've got Ivory Coast v Australia; Argentina v Serbia (remember that match in the World Cup?); China v Brazil; New Zealand v Belgium.</p> <!-- Block 128 --> <p><strong>12.02pm:</strong> Roger Federer is playing in the tennis at the moment, if anyone is interested in the World No2-elect. The Swiss is a set up but 3-0 down in the second to Tomas Berdych.</p> <!-- Block 129 --> <p><strong>12.08pm</strong> The men's 200m backstroke heats are underway in the pool, with British hopes lying with Gregor Tait. Meanwhile, Amnat Ruenroeng has just pummeled Jack Willie, from Papua New Guinea, in the boxing, prompting the line: \"Poor little Jack Wille\" from the internet commentator. And repeated here, of course.</p> <!-- Block 130 --> <p><strong>12.16pm</strong> Gregor Tait finishes second in his heat to Ryan Lochte of the United States, but it's good enough to take him into the semi-finals. Meanwhile, our bloggers have been getting their copy in early, so catch up on <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/13/trials_and_jubilations_for_bri.html\">Richard Williams on Emma Pooley</a>; <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/13/tearful_sacromone_misses_podiu.html\">Sean Ingle on women's gymnastics</a> and <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/13/georgia_and_russia_throw_sand.html\">Lawrence Donegan on the sand storm between Georgia and Russia</a>.</p> <!-- Block 131 --> <p><strong>12.20pm</strong> Johan van Slooten of the Netherlands has a fact and a question: \"Dutch judo legend,\" (takes his word for it) \"and gold medal winner in Tokyo 1964 Anton Geesink lives in the city of Utrecht, in ... Anton Geesink Street! The street was so named after his win in 1964, and years later Anton actually moved into this street. Is he the only athlete ever to live in his own street?\" That's one for The Knowledge, Olympic edition.*<br>*Does not exist.</p> <!-- Block 132 --> <p><strong>12.27pm:</strong> Roger Federer is 5-4 down in the second set, but serving. The football matches are now over, I believe, although the official site is struggling to keep up. Holland beat Japan, Nigeria beat USA 2-1 (freeing up Brad Guzan to join up with Villa, I think, since the Americans appear to be out), Korea beat Honduras, and Cameroon drew 0-0 with Pierluigi Casiraghi's Italy.</p> <!-- Block 133 --> <p><strong>12.36pm:</strong> Kirsty Balfour is up in the 200m breaststroke. No one seems to be expecting much from her, so I'm going to root for the underdog. Roger Federer, meanwhile, is now serving to stay in the second set, ... and succeeds, taking the match to a tiebreak. Balfour, meanwhile, is outside of the top three at 100m.</p> <!-- Block 134 --> <p><strong>12.39pm:</strong> Kirsty Balfour is all but out of the 200m, finishing sixth in her heat. Rebecca Sohn broke the Olympic record, so Balfour had it tough, especially from lane one. She's not officially done, but she's in tears during the post-race interview and \"feels like she's let everyone down\" according to Sharon Davies.</p> <!-- Block 135 --> <p><strong>12.44pm:</strong> Roger Federer is through to the quarter-finals. He wins the second-set tie-break against Berdych and goes through 6-3, 7-6. Serena Williams is up next, with Jamie and Andy Murray playing in the doubles on an outer court. There's not going to be any telly coverage of that one, apparently, so we'll only be able to bring you the score updates, rather than some more glittering prose.</p> <!-- Block 136 --> <p><strong>12.52pm:</strong> The Olympic football match between China and Brazil is underway, and Brazil have started with Ronaldinho, Lucas and Diego. Manchester United's Dong is playing for China.</p> <!-- Block 137 --> <p><strong>12.59pm:</strong> Flicking through all these Olympic channels, there's not much chance to follow any event for longer than about five minutes. I'd quite like to watch a bit of that football match, even if Brazil are through to the next round, but there's the men's individual medley heats starting now too. A Ukrainian and a Russian light flyweight are also duffing one another up on another channel, with the Russian on top at the moment.</p> <!-- Block 138 --> <p><strong>1.03pm</strong> Britain's Liam Tancock is up in the men's individual medley and finishes fourth, behind Laszlo Cseh. That should be enough to go through.</p> <!-- Block 139 --> <p><strong>1.06pm:</strong> Diego has scored for Brazil, giving them a 1-0 lead over China. I missed it, because I was checking in on some badminton, where Denmark and Poland are one game all in the men's doubles.</p> <!-- Block 140 --> <p><strong>1.10pm:</strong> James Goddard is up in heat six of the medley, in which he is blessed just to splutter through the slipstream of the greatest individual that ever lived John Inverdale. I mean Michael Phelps. Phelps won it fairly confidently, but Ryan Lochte in heat five also looked formidable. Godard was fifth and qualified in 13th overall for the semis. Tancock goes through in 14th.</p> <!-- Block 141 --> <p><strong>1.17pm</strong> Guardian Online Sport Editor Sean Ingle's <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/13/tearful_sacromone_misses_podiu.html\">latest article about women's gymnastics</a> has kicked up some stink in the comments box. Are the competing girls Sindys or not Sindys? Stick your oar in by clicking the link above.</p> <!-- Block 142 --> <p><strong>1.21pm: </strong>The French team breaks the women's 4x200m freestyle relay Olympic record in heat one in the Beijing pool. GB are up in heat two.</p> <!-- Block 143 --> <p><strong>1.23pm:</strong> Pete Nichols in Beijing is rubbing his hands together over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/13/olympicgames.tennisfederernadal&quot;\">the prospect of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal meeting at the Olympics</a>.</p> <!-- Block 144 --> <p><strong>1.33pm:</strong> Incompetent Britain alert! Great Britain's women finish sixth in their heat of the 200m freestyle relay, and spectacularly miss the final after finishing ninth overall. They pay the price for resting the top two swimmers over this distance, presumably for the final that they have now failed to reach. That really is some spectacularly bumbling incompetence from Britain and four red-faced women in swimming suits stare at Sharon Davies's microphone and say they're \"gutted\". No kidding. By their own admission, Jo Jackson, Hannah Miley, Fran Halsall and Melanie Marshall did all they could, but I'm really not sure team GB is strong enough to send out a B-team in any Olympic event.</p> <!-- Block 145 --> <p><strong>1.38pm:</strong> The French teenager Alize Cornet has shown some youthful impudence to take the first set off Serena Williams in the tennis. She was 5-1 up, was pegged back to 5-3, but served out for the opening set. Meanwhile, some half-time football scores: China 0-1 Brazil; New Zealand 0-1 Belgium; Argentina 1-0 Serbia; Ivory Coast 0-0 Australia.</p> <!-- Block 146 --> <p><strong>1.47pm</strong> The BBC coverage has suddenly become a bit mumsy as Sue Barker welcomes to the studio the British cycling medalists Emma Pooley and Nicole Cooke for some comfortable sofa-based chatter. Also present is Sharon Laws, who can't wear a medal proudly around her neck because she didn't win one. But \"you work as a team\" says Barker, attempting to include Laws, but then follows up with the zinger: \"How did it feel to win your medal, Emma?\"</p> <!-- Block 147 --> <p><strong>1.50pm:</strong> This is what's wrong with British sport: Sue Barker has now just excitedly asked the British cyclists what it's like to be hanging around at the Olympic village and, conspiratorially, \"Come on, who have you seen?\" as though they are stupid little fan girls hanging round hoping for a glimpse of Michael Phelps.</p> <!-- Block 148 --> <p><strong>1.55pm</strong> <em>This</em> is what the Olympics is all about, burly females lifting heavy weights in one swift motion. Yes, it's the women's snatch. (Joke (c) minute-by-minute coverage, London Olympics 1908.)</p> <!-- Block 149 --> <p><strong>2pm:</strong> Some of your emails: \"Re: 1252 entry: Manchester United's Dong? I thought Dion Dublin retired. HONK!\" (Andrew Seaman); \"After looking at the medal table I was curious to find that Russia is only<br>a teaspoonful ahead of the Team GB, so different from memories of the past. Then I did my sums with my 'Coldwar' head on and found that the USSR (if it still existed) would actually be in third place with 5 golds, 11 silvers and 16 bronzes, but still miles behind the new Big Two.\" (Phil Horton, and his coldwar head); \"Does anyone know what happened in the following event: men in the most ludicrous hats I have ever seen cycled alone along public roads, accompanied only by one or two 4WD vehicles, and a British guy (Cummings?) was occasionally indicated to be no. 1, though the commentators said he could not sustain it (or something), but never explained what it was the cyclists were actually trying to achieve (i.e. to win), or what it was that Cummings(?) could or could not sustain - did he win? Or is it still going on, and am I actually for once watching a live, rather than recorded, event on my Philippines Olympic channel?\" (Al Parkes). </p> <p>See what we have to deal with?</p> <!-- Block 150 --> <p><strong>2.05pm:</strong> Serena Williams is battling back into contention in the tennis, and is 4-1 up in the second set. Messrs Murray lost their first set 6-1.</p> <!-- Block 151 --> <p><strong>2.10pm</strong> I've just picked up a feed of the Great Britain men's hockey match against Holland. I'm going to stick with this, only because I really can't trust myself with the women's weightlifting. And it seems I can't trust you lot either, if the smut arriving in my inbox is anything to go by. You know who you are, Alan Varrow.</p> <!-- Block 152 --> <p><strong>2.15pm</strong> OK, so this hockey is delicately poised after Great Britain won their first match but lie behind the hot favourites Australia and today's opponents, Holland. GB have a penalty corner as we first arrive and although they win another attempt with the first effort, the second is squandered. Nil-nil it remains, with 19 minutes remaining in the first period.</p> <!-- Block 153 --> <p><strong>2.17pm</strong>: Brazil go 3-0 up against China in the football, effectively knocking out the hosts (unless they can find four goals in the last 15 minutes). Thiago Neves got the third, drilling it past the despairing dive of the Chinese goalkeeper from 25 yards. He also got the second, although I didn't see it I'm afraid. Still 0-0 in the hockey.</p> <!-- Block 154 --> <p><strong>2.23pm</strong>: I've never experienced the joy of listening to Olympic football on headphones while watching Olympic hockey on the screen. It means that a commentary of \"Ronaldinho, Marcello, Ronaldinho...\" accompanies pictures of (I must admit) unknown men carrying sticks. Another penalty corner for Great Britain, though.</p> <!-- Block 155 --> <p><strong>2.24pm</strong> GB waste the penalty corner as news reaches that Andy and Jamie Murray have crashed out of the tennis in what can only be described as ignominy, 6-1, 6-3 to France's Arnaud Clement and Michael Llodra.</p> <!-- Block 156 --> <p><strong>2.29pm:</strong> Robert van der Horst comes <em>that</em> near to opening the scoring in the hockey as he slices through the GB defence, then lifts the ball over the goalkeeper but onto the post. Still 0-0 but that was dreadful defending from England and a lovely mazy run from the Dutchman.</p> <!-- Block 157 --> <p><strong>2.30pm:</strong> The Olympic hockey, by the way, has meant a return to the BBC commentary box for Barry Davies, who I never really liked during his self-important pomp, but now feel quite sorry for in a sentimental way because Motty got to carry on while he was sent out to pasture. I always preferred Motson back then, when there was something like a media-contrived Blur v Oasis battle between the two of them, but I think I might have been wrong. Davies is quite restrained here, although he's still doing that staccato-style commentary where he says one .... word ... every .... couple ... of ... seconds ... andthengarblesloadsoutallatoncesoyoucannotreallyfollowit.</p> <!-- Block 158 --> <p><strong>2.35pm: </strong>Bouncing round the various wire services (other news providers are available), it seems that Venus Williams is through to the quarter finals of the tennis after beating Victoria Azarenka of Belarus; Argentina beat Serbia in the football; the German handball left back is out of the tournament with a knee injury but countryman Benjamin Kleibrink won a gold medal in the men's individual foil. It's 0-0 at half time in the hockey.</p> <!-- Block 159 --> <p><strong>2.40pm:</strong> And more results: Football: Ivory Coast 1-0 Australia; New Zealand 0-1 Belgium; China 0-3 Brazil (China out). Meanwhile, the heavyweights are in the boxing ring, and the huge Zhanh Zhilei, of China, battered his Moroccan opponent in the first round.</p> <!-- Block 160 --> <p><strong>2.49pm: </strong>A possible minor controversy brewing in the boxing ring, where the Moroccan boxer Amanissi has, as yet, refused to land a punch at Zhanh Zhilei through the first three rounds. Amanissi is 10-0 down and it's a complete mismatch, with the Moroccan passive enough, according to the commentators, that he could be disqualified for his negativity. There's nothing too sinister about it; he's just completely inept and probably shouldn't be there and is now getting booed from the crowd. And that's it, he loses 15-0 and becomes only the second boxer in more than 150 bouts at these Games to fail to trouble the scorers.</p> <!-- Block 161 --> <p><strong>2.53pm:</strong> The hockey is back, and it's been a pretty impressive show from GB, who have held it to 0-0 against the Dutch, who were the runners up in Athens and much-fancied here. Meanwhile, the individual dressage competition is back underway, where there might be an outside medal chance for GB in the form of Jane Gregory.</p> <!-- Block 162 --> <p><strong>2.59pm:</strong> Holland fail to convert a penalty corner -- that's three I've seen now, and no goals. I thought the conversion rate was slightly higher than that, but maybe not. A Dutchman has also just posted a pretty good score in the dressage, apparently, and in the absence of any personal knowledge, I'll believe anything I hear from a plummy-voiced lady representing the British Broadcasting Corporation.</p> <!-- Block 163 --> <p><strong>3.01pm:</strong> Serena Williams has come from behind to beat Alize Cornet and book her place in the quarter-finals of the women's singles tennis. She lost the first set, but ended up winning 3-6, 6-3, 6-4.</p> <!-- Block 164 --> <p><strong>3.10pm:</strong> You can lead a horse to the disco, but you can't make it dance. Or can you? I'll confess I know nothing about dressage, but that's pretty much what this is, right. Dancing horses. Still 0-0 in the hockey.</p> <!-- Block 165 --> <p><strong>3.15pm: </strong>One of the hockey referees is called Grime. Which is kind of noteworthy, if you're trying to text commentate on a 0-0 draw in a game you don't know much about and when the only emails you're getting are correcting (admitedly quite major) typos from earlier posts. Meanwhile, the British player James Tindall has just been sent for a spell on the sidelines for hoiking his stick around an opponent's ankles while he was charging in on goal. That's a foul in any sport. With sticks.</p> <!-- Block 166 --> <p><strong>3.18pm: </strong>And Tindall has been properly punished. His tackle gives the Dutch a penalty corner, which they whip into their dangerman Taeke Taekeme, who slaps it into the bottom corner. The keeper got a touch, but it was far too hard and accurate and Holland now lead 1-0 with about six minutes left.</p> <!-- Block 167 --> <p><strong>3.21pm:</strong> Another penalty corner for the Dutch, this time the result of another crude trip by the British side. This time, though, Wilson in the British goal pulls off a terrific diving save. The dancing horses have a tendency to crash my computer when I try to watch them, so I might hold off for a while.</p> <!-- Block 168 --> <p><strong>3.25pm:</strong> That's it, Holland have won the hockey and Barry Davies is back to his sanctimonious best. The goal was scored \"from a penalty corner given away, quite frankly, needlessly\" he says, and I bet you can just <em>hear</em> his distinctive tones running through that sentence. Great Britain are now third in the standings but have it all to do. They have to beat all the lower ranked countries, then overpower the reigning champions and tournament favourites Australia to progress. Let's face it, it ain't gonna happen.</p> <!-- Block 169 --> <p><strong>3.30pm:</strong> Boxing now -- this is more fun than I could possibly imagine -- as David Price, the super super super heavyweight (6ft 8in, no less), from Liverpool, goes up against Russia's European champion Islam Timurziev. Timurziev is a massive favourite, but Price is simply massive and hops over the ropes in one bound. They're off</p> <!-- Block 170 --> <p><strong>3.35pm: </strong>The first of four two-minute rounds goes to the Russian, 2-0. Price can count himself unlucky not to be only one behind after a decent body blow should definitely have scored, but the judges ruled otherwise. Timurziev's second point comes from the last punch of the round.</p> <!-- Block 171 --> <p><strong>3.40pm:</strong> Wow! Massive upset in the boxing as two huge right-hands from David Price ends this one! The first puts the European champion down on one knee and earns him a standing count, then the Russian walks straight onto another one from the giant Liverpudlian and the referee stops it. Perhaps the decision to stop it was a bit premature, but Price is bounding across the ring and that's a great victory for the Brit. \"Ee never gets knocked out, 'im,\" says Price at the end.</p> <!-- Block 172 --> <p><strong>3.42pm: </strong>That's a terrific result for Price. Timurziev was the favourite for the gold medal, and definitely fancied to beat Price. But the 6ft 8in David slayed the 6ft 2in Goliath, or something, and that's that. Price is through.</p> <!-- Block 173 --> <p>And with that terrific one-two from Price, we're calling this off for the day. Good to finish this watch on a high note, especially after the last-gasp hockey capitulation and the calamitous women's 200m freestyle relay. Thanks for your emails and join us tomorrow at an ungodly hour for more action from Beijing. Goodnight/day/eveing/bye.</p>"
