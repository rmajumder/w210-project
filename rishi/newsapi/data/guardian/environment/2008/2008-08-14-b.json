  "<p>1. Madonna's \"Confessions ...\" tour was the highest-grossing tour by a female artist. In your face, Lisa Scott-Lee.</p> <p>2. Madonna was only inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame this year because the Hall of Fame requires a minimum career length of 25 years. Therefore, we still have a while to wait until the Hall of Fame is able to recognise the genius of Gary Lightbody, Roy from Scouting for Girls or Shaggy. Perhaps it is time they looked at making a few exceptions for these titans of popular song.</p> <p>3. Madonna likes clothes. Madonna also likes money. Happily, she has found a way to combine these two passions, having appeared in advertisements for Gap - with Missy Elliott - and H&amp;M, for whom she designed (\"designed\") a range of clothes.</p> <p>4. During the course of their training all local TV news reporters and tabloid journalists are coached in referring to Madonna as \"The Material Girl\" at least twice every 18 months. This is in reference to Madonna's hit single Material Girl.</p> <p>5. According to her brother Christopher, the only thing Madonna can cook is Rice Krispie cakes. This means that dishes she is incapable of serving up include La Isla Bolognese, Dear Jelly, Hanky Lamb Shanky, Don't Cry for Me Polenta, and Crazy for Yule Log.</p> <p>6. People call her Madge, although not to her face.</p> <p>7. Felix Howard, the fresh-faced 13-year-old in the Open Your Heart video, is now a music business bigwig and has written songs for artists including Amy Winehouse, Kylie Minogue and Sugababes.</p> <p>8. Like A Virgin was originally written for a MAN. Disgusting.</p> <p>9. Artists to have sung songs about Madonna include Robbie Williams (the Pet Shop Boys collaboration She's Madonna was the best song on Rudebox, whatever that counts for), Sparks (\"Madonna\" tells the story of a late night cab right with The Madgster) and the Androids (Do It With Madonna is about rumpo). Madonna is also referenced in Sophie Ellis-Bextor's New York City Lights: \"Madonna says it's true, the town gets hold of you\". Quite a good line.</p> <p>10. It's a myth that Madonna went to Times Square with only $35 and some ballet shoes, according \u2013 once again! - to her brother. Apparently, she went there with money and loads of contacts, although if you're going to have a go at a master manipulator like Madonna for rewriting her own past then you might as well go around shouting at cows for mooing and shooting milk out of their tits.</p> <p>11. The best Madonna headline ever to have appeared in the popular press was Fallen Madonna With The Big Boobies, although for that to make any sort of sense you need to know that it was just after she fell off a horse, and even then you'd still be confused if you weren't familiar with British 80s sitcom Allo Allo. You had to be there, etc.</p> <p>12. Madonna has performed at Live 8, Live Aid and Live Earth, although somehow the world is STILL plagued by hunger and poverty and the environment STILL looks like it is all going tits up. The looming inevitability of the latter catastrophe is all the more surprising given that Madonna actually wrote a new song, Hey You, for Live Earth. Clearly, \"the environment\" is no fan of good music.</p> <p>13. Betty Boo tells an amusing story about Madonna giving her one of her jackets. Madonna was quite keen on Betty Boo at one point in the 1990s, describing her as \"criminally overlooked\" and attempting to sign the cat-headed songstress to her Maverick label.</p> <p>14. Other artists to have been signed to Maverick include Alanis, the Prodigy, Mirwais, and a load of people you have never heard of.</p> <p>15. Norwegian songbird Annie sampled Madonna's Everybody on her debut single, Greatest Hit. Establishing a pattern that continues to plague Annie's career in 2008, the song was not in fact a great hit at all, but was very good indeed.</p> <p>16. Madonna reportedly turned down Prince when he asked her to take the female lead in his Graffiti Bridge movie, because the screenplay was awful. To give you an idea of how bad she thought the screenplay was, films Madonna said yes to include Shanghai Surprise, Swept Away, Dick Tracy, Body of Evidence and The Next Best Thing. She has received Razzie awards for Worst Actress (several times) and Worst Supporting Actress (twice), also being half responsible for winning Worst Screen Couple (twice), and, in 2000, Worst Actress of the Century.</p> <p>17. Madonna has scored 64 (SIXTY FOUR) UK Top 40 hits. That will be a flash, but probably quite expensive, box set when Warners put it out in time for Christmas now that Madge has pissed off to Live Nation.</p> <p>18. Like a Virgin has made a huge impact on British popular culture, and for evidence of this we need only direct our attention toward the Okey Cokey Karaoke episode of sitcom Birds of a Feather in which comedic nymphomaniac Dorien sings the song in a nightclub. It's testament to this set piece's earth shattering amazingness that the directors of the half-hour sitcom opted to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyqLWrNfWN8\">include the song from beginning to end</a>. </p> <p>19. At the UK media playback for Confessions on a Dance Floor there were Madonna-branded DJ slipmats. Very clever. Dance floor. DJs. Decks.</p> <p>20. At the UK media playback session for Hard Candy there was a massive mosaic of the album's sleeve, made out of Jelly Belly sweets. Very clever. Candy. Candy.</p> <p>21. Also at the Hard Candy playback was an ocean of free booze which, with hindsight, may go some way to explaining the largely glowing reviews of what, in the cold light of day, turned out to be a deeply underwhelming album that has alienated even some of the singer's hardcore fans. Many of these fans still admire Madonna's continued hunger for success, but feel that in chasing the popular music style of the day rather than setting her own agenda she has, for perhaps the first time, begun to show her age.</p> <p>22. Her age, incidentally, is 50. Hence these 50 amazing facts. Other singers to be 50 this year include Michael Jackson, Prince, Kate Bush and Ice-T. If one were to put them in order of who had grown old the most gracefully, Madonna would be slap bang in the middle.</p> <p>23. Other dishes Madonna cannot cook include Another Fruitcake in Another Hall, Take a Bowl of Porridge, Who's That Grill and What it Feels Like for a Viennese Whirl.</p> <p>24. Madonna's wealth is estimated to be well in excess of $400m, although you can expect this to rocket when the Hard Candy \"millions\" start rolling in.</p> <p>25. During the recording of Hard Candy one of the album's producers, Pharrell Williams, made Madonna cry \"like a baby\".</p> <p>26. It can be stated without any waiting or hesitating that Madonna is not the world's greatest lyricist, although her words do have \"a certain charm\". Her best lyrics are on the Like a Virgin album, but she didn't really write those, except for album track Shoo-Bee-Doo. (Oh dear.)</p> <p>27. Madonna once noted: \"I want to be like Gandhi and Martin Luther King and John Lennon - but I want to stay alive.\"</p> <p>28. A song Madonna quite likes is the Todd Terry remix of Everything But the Girl's Missing.</p> <p>29. The Babyface-produced single Take a Bow remains Madonna's longest-running No 1 single in America \u2013 it topped the charts for seven weeks, but in the UK the ballad ended a 10-year run of consecutive Top 10 singles when it wound up at No 16 around Christmas in 1995. Shouldn't have chucked in some sleigh bells.</p> <p>30. Madonna has had a single in the UK Top 40 every year except 1988, 2004 and 2007. After these \"breaks\" she returned with Like a Prayer in 1989 (amazing), Hung Up in 2005 (amazing) and 4 Minutes in 2008 (sort of amazing).</p> <p>31. Vogue was originally going to be a B-side because Madonna didn't think it would be strong enough to be released as a single.</p> <p>32. Madonna is the best-selling female artist of all time, but you probably could have guessed that.</p> <p>33. Madonna gave her song Love Won't Wait to Gary Barlow for his second solo single which, despite being absolutely terrible, became a No 1 hit single. Madonna's version remains unreleased \u2026</p> <p>34. Film soundtracks on which Madonna appears include Die Another Day, At Close Range, With Honours, The Next Best Thing, A League of Their Own, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and various others.</p> <p>35. American Pie, from The Next Best Thing, is actually brilliant. Although you cannot buy it on iTunes, for some reason.</p> <p>36. In 1982, as Everybody was proving \"big in the clubs\", Madonna auditioned for Fame but didn't get the part of Leroy.</p> <p>37. Madonna's first band was called The Breakfast Club.</p> <p>38. 4 Minutes is actually four minutes and four seconds long \u2013 a disastrous misfire which could have been remedied if Timbaland had increased the song's speed by just one beat per minute.</p> <p>39. Madonna lost her virginity in the back of a Cadillac, later explaining that she saw it as a career move.</p> <p>40. Madonna once stated that she thought her Dick Tracy album I'm Breathless was her best because it was \"different\".</p> <p>41. Ingredients Madonna does not have in her kitchen \u2013 because she cannot cook \u2013 include Cumin Nature, Bedthyme Story, and This Used to Be My Playground Nutmeg.</p> <p>42. The Immaculate Collection is one of the best titles of a greatest hits album in the history of pop.</p> <p>43. It is certainly better than GHV2.</p> <p>44. Earlier this month Madonna's was named the \"ultimate face\" in a New Yorker feature on plastic surgery, with surgeons explaining that hers is one of clients' most sought-after \"visages\".</p> <p>45. Men to have recorded cover versions of Madonna songs include Marilyn Manson (Justify My Love), Marc Almond (Like A Prayer), KMFDM (Material Girl) and Teenage Fanclub (Like a Virgin).</p> <p>46. In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine ranked Madonna at No 36 in their 100 Greatest Artists of All Time poll. Not bad for a girl, right lads?</p> <p>47. True Blue remains Madonna's most successful album, shifting 24m units.</p> <p>48. Madonna's family own a vineyard in Michigan where one can purchase limited-edition Madonna wine.</p> <p>49. Supernatural, the B-side to Cherish, is about a ghost who has sex with Madonna.</p> <p>50. Back to the cooking, though. Because she cannot cook very well she probably eats a lot of biscuits. One can imagine her emerging from a kitchen brandishing a plate containing including a Bourbonline and a Guy Richtea. Maybe there would be a choc ice, too, but she'd bring that out later because it's Frozen. She is certainly not a True Cordon Bleu. You might even (That's quite enough of that \u2013 Ed)</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2008/jul/30/madonna.popandrock?picture=336082414\"><em>See a picture for every year Madonna's been alive!</em></a></p>",
  "<p>As a development model, the ecotown is to be welcomed. However, as former presidents of the Royal Town Planning Institute, we hold serious reservations about the way in which sites for these developments have been promoted (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/11/ecotowns.greenbuilding\">Germaine Greer, G2, August 11</a>). Some of the proposed ecotowns derive from a clear planning process, but others represent an undermining of planning policy at both regional and local level. Some have simply provided excuses for landowners to reintroduce tired schemes that have already been rejected within a legitimate planning process. It is our view that this approach is wrong. </p> <p>A fundamental relationship, particularly in view of energy costs, has to be that between development and infrastructure, not least in the provisions for efficient public transport. We find little reassurance on this point within most of the ecotowns proposed so far. The priorities of promoting urban renewal and expansion remain: there are no easy solutions. The use of brownfield sites represents a creditable achievement by the government. We must now seek better procedures to redevelop run-down areas and establish interdisciplinary skills to deliver sustainable solutions - skills which can be applied from inception and planning to final build. Many must be involved - not only all in design and development and those representing local interests, but those who may bring experience in economics and in sociology to town development. </p> <p>Securing the best development is a very complex business; to support it, a strong planning system is essential. We find it regrettable that a government which professes to endorse sustainability is pursuing an approach which, except in two or three important instances, is likely to achieve exactly the opposite.<br><strong>John Anderson, Martin Bradshaw, Stephen Byrne, John Collins </strong>and 10 other former presidents of the Royal Town Planning Institute</p>",
  "<p>Man-made pollution is spreading a growing number of suffocating dead zones across the world's seas with disastrous consequences for marine life, scientists have warned.</p> <p>The experts say the hundreds of regions of critically low oxygen now affect a combined area the size of New Zealand, and that they pose as great a threat to life in the world's oceans as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/may/11/fishing.food\">overfishing</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/13/conservation.forests\">habitat loss</a>.</p> <p>The number of such seabed zones \u2013 caused when massive algal blooms feeding off pollutants such as fertiliser die and decay \u2013 has boomed in the last decade. There were some 405 recorded in coastal waters worldwide in 2007, up from 305 in 1995 and 162 in the 1980s.</p> <p>Robert Diaz, an oceans expert at the US Virginia Institute of Marine Science, College of William and Mary, at Gloucester Point, said: \"Dead zones were once rare. Now they're commonplace. There are more of them in more places.\"</p> <p>Marine bacteria feed on the algae in the blooms after it has died and sunk to the bottom, and in doing so they use up all of the oxygen dissolved in the water. The resulting 'hypoxic' seabed zones can asphyxiate swathes of bottom dwelling organisms such as clams and worms, and disrupt fish populations.</p> <p>Diaz and his colleague, Rutger Rosenberg of the department of marine ecology at the University of Gothenburg, call for more careful use of fertilisers to address the problem. </p> <p>Writing in the journal Science, the researchers say the dead zones must be viewed as one of the \"major global environmental problems\". They say: \"There is no other variable of such ecological importance to coastal marine ecosystems that has changed so drastically over such a short time.\"</p> <p>The key solution, they say, is to \"keep fertilisers on the land and out of the sea\". Changes in the way fertilisers and other pollutants are managed on land have already \"virtually eliminated\" dead zones from the Mersey and Thames estuaries, they say.</p> <p>Diaz says his concern is shared by farmers who are worried about the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/12/biofuels.food\">high cost of fertilisers</a>. \"They certainly don't want to see their dollars flowing off their fields. Scientists and farmers need to continue working together to minimise the transfer of nutrients from land to sea.\"</p> <p>The number of dead zones reported has doubled each decade since the 1960s, but the scientists say they are often ignored until they provoke problems among populations of larger creatures such as fish or lobsters. By killing or stunting the growth of bottom-dwelling organisms, the lack of oxygen denies food to creatures higher up the food chain.</p> <p>The Baltic Sea, site of the world's largest dead zone, has lost about 30% of its available food energy, which has led to a significant decline in its fisheries.</p> <p>The lack of oxygen can also force fish into warmer waters closer to the surface, perhaps making them more susceptible to disease.</p> <p>The size of marine dead zones often fluctuates with the seasons. A massive dead zone, some 8,000 square miles across, forms each summer in the Gulf of Mexico as floodwater flushes nitrogen-rich fertiliser into the Mississippi River. </p> <p>Experts said it was slightly smaller than expected this year because Hurricane Dolly stirred up the water. Dead zones require the water to be separated into layers, with little or no mixing between.</p> <p>As well as fertilisers rich in nitrates and phosphates, sewage discharges also contribute to the problem because they help the algal blooms to flourish.</p> <p>Diaz and Rosenberg say: \"We believe it would be unrealistic to return to pre-industrial levels of nutrient input [to oceans], but an appropriate management goal would be to reduce nutrient inputs to levels that occurred in the middle of the past century,\" before the rise in added nutrients began to spread dead zones globally.</p> <p>Climate change could be adding to the problem. Many regions are expected to experience more severe periods of heavy rain, which could wash more nutrients from farmland into rivers.</p> <p>In May, scientists reported that oxygen-depleted zones in tropical oceans are expanding. They analysed oxygen levels in samples of seawater and found the effect was largest in the central and eastern tropical Atlantic and the equatorial Pacific. The increase could push oxygen-starved zones closer to the surface and give marine life such as fish less room to live and look for food. </p> <p>The scientists, led by Lothar Stramma from the Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences in Kiel, Germany, say the change could be linked to warming seas. At 0C, a litre of seawater can hold about 10ml of dissolved oxygen; at 25C this falls to 4ml. Stramma said: \"Whether or not these observed changes in oxygen can be attributed to global warming alone is still unresolved.\" The reduction could also be down to natural processes working on shorter timescales, he said.</p>",
  "<p>Vouchers worth up to \u00a3100 will be issued by the government to help hundreds of thousands of low income families with the costs of rising fuel bills, ministers are planning to announce.</p> <p>The payments are expected to form the centrepiece of Gordon Brown's autumn effort to revive his premiership by outlining initiatives to help people cope with the global economic downturn.</p> <p>Whitehall sources confirmed last night that Downing Street and the Treasury are drawing up plans with other departments for fuel vouchers of between \u00a350 and \u00a3100 for low income families.</p> <p>Channel 4 News reported that payments would be aimed at some of the six million families who receive child tax credit. People claiming the working families tax credit may also qualify.</p> <p>It would cost the government \u00a3600m to pay to energy companies \u00a3100 on behalf of each of the families receiving child tax credit, the Institute for Fiscal Studies told Channel 4. If the government used information about people's income on the child tax credit forms to target the poorest half of claimants, that would halve the cost.</p> <p>This suggests that the government has decided not to make a fuel payment of up to \u00a3150 to all 7.5m families claiming child benefit. The Sunday Times reported at the weekend that Sir Brian Bender, permanent secretary at the Department of Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform which is involved in drawing up the plans, was overheard on a train, when asked whether the payments would be aimed at low income families, saying: \"No, a fuel rebate for everybody on child benefit.\"</p> <p>But Whitehall sources said last night that payments would not be universal and aimed at low income families.</p> <p>Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrats' Treasury spokesman, told Channel 4 News: \"This is a seriously bad idea. The problem here is that the energy regulator, Ofgem, has identified the fact that the energy companies are benefiting to the tune of about \u00a310bn over five years from being allocated free permits under the European trading scheme. It is a windfall to those companies.</p> <p>\"The underlying problem is that poor families pay much more for their power than better off families. If you're on meter the charges are much higher than on direct debit. They also live in badly insulated homes. The programme has to target those problems rather than flows of income.\"</p>",
  "<p>Miners came to the rescue yesterday after another rise in commodity prices, some upbeat broker research and hopes of more consolidation in the sector.</p> <p>With copper climbing to a one-week high after its recent wobble, <strong>Antofagasta</strong> was the biggest riser in the FTSE 100, adding 25.5p to 563.5p. <strong>Kazakhmys</strong> climbed 57p to \u00a312.62, while <strong>Anglo American </strong>was 132p better at \u00a329.23.</p> <p>Merrill Lynch issued a positive note on the sector, saying: \"Ask yourself the question: what is the risk/reward of being underweight miners as the Olympics in China draw to a close and Chinese manufacturers restart?\"</p> <p><strong>Rio Tinto</strong> rose 142p to \u00a348 as Sanford Bernstein said the shares could be worth \u00a380 each, while <strong>BHP Billiton </strong>bounced 70p to \u00a315.82 after the same analysts put a \u00a325 target on its shares.

  "<p>Climate change is making British birds lay their eggs earlier in the year, according to a major survey of how common species are changing their behaviour to cope with warmer temperatures.</p> <p>Analysis of 30,000 nests shows that birds such as the chaffinch and the robin are laying their eggs about a week earlier than in the 1960s. A similar pattern has been seen for other species, such as blue tits, great tits and swallows.</p> <p>The survey also found that birds were altering their nesting and migration patterns, and travelling further to find food. The change in egg-laying behaviour has prompted concerns that young birds could emerge in spring before suitable food is available.</p> <p>Matt Murphy, ornithologist for the <a href=\"http://www.ccw.gov.uk/?lang=en\">Countryside Council for Wales</a> said climate change was affecting the breeding patterns of pied flycatchers living in Welsh oak woodlands. </p> <p>He said: \"They appear to be breeding earlier across a number of sites and the worry is they may eventually breed so early they are out of sync with their major food source of caterpillars.\" </p> <p>The annual State of the UK's Birds report was produced by several conservation groups, including the <a href=\"http://www.rspb.org.uk/\">RSPB</a>, Natural England and the <a href=\"http://www.wwt.org.uk/\">Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust</a>. It shows that drier summers are forcing species such as the song thrush to rear fewer chicks. The birds rely on earthworms for food, which are harder to find in drier ground.</p> <p>Dr Mark Avery, conservation director for the RSPB, said: \"This year's report shows that climate change is with us already and from our gardens to our seas, birds are having to respond rapidly to climate change simply to survive. As often before, birds are acting like the canaries in a mine shaft and giving us early warning of dangerous change.\" </p> <p>The report found many of the UK's farmland and woodland birds species were continuing to decline, particularly specialists that require a particular habitat, such as the lesser-spotted woodpecker.<br> In Scotland, there has been a fall in the breeding success of seabirds such as guillemots, puffins and kittiwakes, as warming sea temperatures affect the food chain. </p> <p>Conservationists are concerned the drop in productivity, as a result of a lack of sandeels, will mean fewer breeding birds and continued decline of key species. </p> <p>The critically endangered Balearic shearwater, another seabird, has been spotted more often in the UK, as climate change forces it to travel further to find fish. </p> <p>But the report said there have been large declines in numbers of over-wintering wading birds such as purple sandpipers, ringed plovers and dunlins, which come to the UK's estuaries from northerly and easterly breeding grounds. </p> <p>It said the birds could be \"short stopping\" - remaining on the continent as the conditions there become more suitable in the winter.<br> The report said that a dramatic reduction in duck numbers spending the winter at Lough Neagh in Northern Ireland, suggested some key bodies of water in Europe were no longer freezing over.</p>",

  "<p>Not everybody's bottom line has been hit by the credit crunch. John Connolly, global chairman of accountants Deloitte, earned \u00a35.7m last year - \u00a31m more than the year before - despite the onset of what has been described as the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.</p> <p>Connolly and his 680 fellow partners benefited from a rise in debt, restructuring and forensic accounting work, fees from which helped offset a downturn in companies seeking merger and acquisition advice.</p> <p>A rise in corporate finance profits as well as in its three other divisions -audit, tax and consulting - gave the accountancy firm a 16% rise in profits to \u00a3652m. </p> <p>The average profit per partner rose to \u00a3970,000 from \u00a3877,000, while partners on the executive committee shared a profit pool of \u00a344m, which was \u00a310m up on the year before.</p> <p>Connolly had set a goal to breach \u00a32bn in revenue in two years, a target achieved with \u00a310m to spare in 2008, the firm revealed yesterday. Deloitte was reporting \u00a31.6bn in revenues when the target was set. He is now setting a target of \u00a33bn revenue within three years - when his term of office ends - as part of his strategy to make the firm the \"market leader\".</p> <p>Deloitte is the first of the big four accountants to report, and Connolly believes it is likely to be chasing PriceWaterhouseCoopers, the current No 1, but lead KPMG and Ernst &amp; Young. </p> <p>Connolly said the audit arm was working on client companies' year-end results earlier than usual because of problems that might emerge in the credit crunch. Auditors can get blamed when firms run into difficulty and Deloitte wants to avoid accusations of missing warning signs in this downturn.</p> <p>He is less pessimistic than some: while he expects 2008 to be a difficult year, he forecasts a \"pick-up\" in the UK economy in the later part of 2009 or early 2010. </p> <p>The tax arm has traditionally won business from private equity firms although the downturn in buyouts has led to a drop in fees from this area, but it has won new business from clients in emerging markets who are setting up in the UK.</p>",
  "<p>It's summer in the gentle Suffolk seaside resort of Southwold and Adnams ale is flowing freely in the brewery's four pubs and two hotels in the town. In the afternoon sunshine, executive chairman Jonathan Adnams can sometimes be heard practising bluegrass banjo on the East Green, a patch of grass in front of the brew house.</p> <p>It is not hard to see why Gordon Brown picked this remote spot for his summer break. A stroll along the beach and a quiet pint of Adnams Bitter, Broadside or Explorer, can make the worries of the wider economy feel a long way away.</p> <p>In conversation, Adnams refers three times to \"the outside world\". The phrase, which also crops up in the group's annual report, hints at the mind-set at the eponymous family-controlled minnow. The company, with a market capitalisation of about \u00a352m, jostles for the attention of a dozen or so multibillion-pound pub and supermarket groups that dominate the national drinks trade.</p> <p>Making Adnams' task even more difficult over the past 10 years has been the rapid rise of two powerful regional brewery groups which have been transformed into insatiable pub-acquisition engines. One is Midlands-based Marston's, the other, which has headquarters 50 miles inland from Southwold at Bury St Edmunds, is Greene King. Since 1996 Greene King has acquired 2,200 pubs in Britain, taking its total to 2,600. Adnams has 78.</p> <p>At first the chairman blocks talk of his powerful neighbours. \"I'm not here to talk about Greene King,\" he says abruptly. But it is hard to articulate the challenges facing the company without mention of the competition.</p> <p><strong>Lockout</strong></p> <p>Before long, Adnams returns to the subject, sketching out how he sees his neighbours' business model. \"What that does is 'lock out',\" he says. \"You buy pubs, you paint them green [Greene King] or you paint them red [Marston's], and you then brew the cask beer and you lock everything else out - that's very much the Greene King model. You buy all the pubs you can and you lock every other producer out.\"</p> <p>The subject is a sore one and only in passing does Adnams suggest that \"perhaps it is something the government ought to look at\", recalling the 1989 Beer Orders that were supposed to unravel the dominance of brewery groups.</p> <p>At the end of June, Adnams, which is listed on the junior Plus Market, issued a profits warning, telling investors half-year profits would be \"substantially lower\" than the previous year. The chairman said Adnams was \"heavily exposed\" in a contracting ale market because it had few pubs of its own.</p> <p>Passionate as he is about the family business, in his early years Adnams showed little ambition for the life of a beer baron. \"I wasn't particularly keen on school and my father said: 'Get an offer to do something else and you can leave.' So I left school at 16 and went fishing for a year.\" </p> <p>Even as a schoolboy, he had spent much of his summer holidays working on a dredger. \"My parents used to wave me goodbye with two pounds of bacon for the galley and I'd help crew the gravel barges taking the aggregate from Southwold to other places. The whole thing was run on a shoestring. It was a bit like Fred Karno's army - the barges were either sinking, breaking adrift, or crushing somebody else's boat ... It was a wonderful experience for somebody of 14, 15, 16.\"</p> <p>Aged 19, Adnams returned and joined the firm, starting as an apprentice engineer, while juggling his day job with what became a 27-year commitment as a lifeboat man. Re-engaging with education through part-time courses, he built the skills to progress to more senior roles in the company. </p> <p>By the mid-1990s another strong personality emerged at the helm of Adnams - Simon Loftus, a Cambridge-educated wine buff and author, whose family had been significant minority investors in Adnams for more than 90 years. At that time the business seemed to be in terminal decline, so it fell to Loftus to set a course that would mark Adnams apart from the staid traditions that were destroying so many regional brewers. A pioneer in corporate social responsibility and corporate transparency, Loftus shaped a modern vision for the firm, encapsulated in a corporate motto - \"Doing the right thing\" - which may seem a little quaint now, but at the time was revolutionary.</p> <p>Loftus, by then working closely with Adnams, who had risen to managing director, began building a name for the small brewery. By the time Adnams took over as chairman in 2006, the pair had doubled sales and quadrupled profits. </p> <p>While new bottled ales, and chilled and filtered beers can upset cask-ale enthusiasts, they helped the Adnams name burst on to the national stage, with listings in supermarkets and contracts with the country's largest landlord groups, Punch Taverns and Enterprise Inns. Adnams is now served in about 5,000 pubs in Britain.</p> <p>One of the most visible legacies of Loftus's chairmanship is a hi-tech energy-efficient brewing facility, painstakingly constructed so as not to spoil the Victorian terrace-cottage facade that forms one side of the Sole Bay brewery in the centre of Southwold. Inside, Adnams likens the computer-controlled machinery to the Starship Enterprise.</p> <p>\"We're not sitting here saying: 'Look at our wonderful old brewery. My grandad used that.' It might have been wonderful 100 years ago, but the world's moved on. And that's our whole mind-set. Some regional brewers can be quite paternalistic - traditional, with things rooted in yesteryear. And they very much pervade that. I'm not knocking it; that's their style. But I think that's very much not our style here.\"</p> <p>Adnams' newly built warehouse in a disused gravel pit is another sight to behold. Built with bricks made from compressed hemp, the 1,200sq metre (13,000sq ft) depot is capped with a curved roof covered in flowering sedum that covers the 13m high structure. The project cost Adnams about 20% more than a conventional warehouse but its construction and operation saved heavily on its carbon footprint. </p> <p>Building on these initiatives, in April Adnams launched a bottled brand called East Green Carbon Neutral, the first product to carry an endorsement from the government-backed Carbon Trust.</p> <p>While awards and plaudits are piling up, Adnams is aware the trading climate for his core beer sales is as unforgiving as it has ever been. Last week Liverpool brewery Cains - another producer with few pubs behind it - was forced to call in administrators. </p> <p><strong>Values</strong></p> <p>The corporate values that have set Adnams apart will be tested to the full in the next two years as the economy slows and the pub trade shrinks. Its chairman, whose family has owned the Southwold brewery since 1872, talks of a \"tipping point\" having been reached in beer sales this spring. As a result he has halted expansion plans for the firm's wine and kitchenware chain, Cellar &amp; Kitchen. A target of doubling profits over five years has also been scrapped.</p> <p>Although Adnams is confident he has the support of the majority of investors who control company votes in the firm's two-tier share structure - largely family members - he acknowledges that as the trading environment worsens there will be pressure from some investors, most notably Guinness Peat, which has a stake of almost 9%.</p> <p>\"In these difficult times there will be some of our shareholders who think short-term gain is better. But it is really about what the majority want. For many years, our ethos has been to run the company for the long-term sustainable benefit of all stakeholders. Our strategy hasn't changed, it's only the pace that has. It's not an expansionist game today, it's a defensive game. Probably will be for the next two years.\"</p> <h2>CV</h2> <p><strong>Born</strong></p> <p>November 25 1956, Suffolk</p> <p><strong>Education</strong></p> <p>Framlingham College; estate management at Southampton Technical College</p> <p><strong>Career</strong></p> <p><strong>1973</strong> Left school at 16 to become a deep-sea fisherman</p> <p><strong>1975</strong> Joined Adnams as apprentice engineer, quickly moving into distribution management</p> <p><strong>1988</strong> Director of pubs and distribution</p> <p><strong>1997</strong> Managing director</p> <p><strong>2006</strong> Executive chairman</p> <p><strong>Family</strong></p> <p>Single</p> <p><strong>Interests</strong></p> <p>Bluegrass banjo, sailing and learning Lithuanian</p>",
  "<p>British Airways unveiled an alliance with American Airlines and Spain's Iberia yesterday that will allow the three carriers to agree fares and schedules - prompting warnings from rival Virgin Atlantic that passengers will face higher ticket prices.</p> <p>BA must convince officials in Washington and Brussels that the agreement to cooperate on flights between North America, Mexico and Europe will not lead to fare rises and distort the crucial London-New York market. Virgin Atlantic laid down a marker as the deal's most vehement opponent yesterday, when the airline's founder, Sir Richard Branson, warned yesterday that the alliance would be a \"monster monopoly\".</p> <p>BA's chief executive, Willie Walsh, said the partnership would give British customers more reliable and cheaper journeys to American destinations. \"There is no reason why fares should go up as a result of this. For the consumer, it means they will have access to a much bigger network. We will coordinate our schedules to make it easier to connect between airlines and you will have greater access to cheaper fares,\" he said. </p> <p>Passengers on transatlantic routes would be able to choose between BA and AA fares when booking flights, Walsh said, allowing them to select the cheapest fare for both legs of a return journey. \"There will be nothing to stop the customer from taking a fare with AA outbound and taking a fare with BA on the inbound leg.\"</p> <p>It is the third attempt by BA to forge an alliance with the second-largest airline in the US, six years after the previous attempt foundered when the European commission demanded the sale of 32 take-off and landing slots at Heathrow as a concession.</p> <p>Virgin Atlantic, BA's fiercest rival in the UK-US market, warned that the deal would give BA and AA control over nearly two-thirds of one of the most lucrative markets in aviation: Heathrow to New York's JFK airport. \"Make no mistake, if this monster monopoly is approved it will be third time unlucky for consumers. It will still be bad for passengers, bad for competition, and bad for the UK and US aviation industry,\" said Branson.</p> <p>Walsh hit back, claiming that the airline industry was now \"completely different\" because the recent liberalisation of the transatlantic airline market had created a competitive market in Heathrow-US flights. The Open Skies treaty in March replaced an agreement that limited the Heathrow-JFK route to four airlines. \"This is an open market and that is the big difference between now and 2001. Anybody can come in and compete,\" said Walsh, who added that nine airlines now operated between Heathrow and the US.</p> <p>BA is the biggest carrier at Heathrow, owning 42% of the take-off and landing slots, but Walsh ruled out selling some to appease regulators. BA will argue that two global airline alliances, Skyteam and Star Alliance, already have anti-trust immunity for transatlantic flights, allowing Air France-KLM and Germany's Lufthansa to cooperate over capacity, scheduling, networks and fares with their respective partners, United Airlines and Delta.</p> <p>\"We have seen Open Skies and we have seen the effects,\" Walsh said. \"The other two alliances have anti-trust immunity. The issue of competition between the alliances is much more relevant than it was in 2001 and we have a changed industry environment. Things have changed sufficiently for us to apply with confidence this time.\"</p> <p>Walsh added that there had been no preliminary discussions with AA over a full-blown merger, which is currently prohibited under ownership guidelines. BA is already in merger discussions with Iberia to form a \u20ac5bn (\u00a33.96bn) airline but the deal could take up to a year to complete.</p> <p>The flag carriers Finnair and Royal Jordanian are also applying for anti-trust immunity as part of the alliance, but the inquiry by the US department of transportation and the EU competition directorate is expected to focus on the transatlantic market.</p> <p>Discussing commercially sensitive information such as fares and scheduling between airlines is illegal unless it is given prior blessing by competition authorities. Without anti-trust clearance, carriers can face price-fixing charges, as BA found when it was fined more than \u00a3270m by US and UK regulators last year for colluding with Virgin Atlantic over fuel surcharges.</p>",
  "<p>The sleek, touchscreen iPhone has proved so lucrative for Apple that the electronic gadgets manufacturer has unseated Google to become the most valuable company in America's cradle of technological innovation, Silicon Valley.</p> <p>Queues outside Apple's stores are commonplace since the phone's launch a year ago as shoppers line up to get their hands on the prized device.</p> <p>On Wall Street, the phenomenal popularity of the phone has fuelled a 44% surge in Apple's share price in 12 months. By the close of trading on Wednesday, Apple's market value had edged up to $158.8bn - a shade ahead of Google's $157.2bn.</p> <p>Apple's predominance amounts to a shift in the balance of power in the hi-tech world. The company has repeatedly been able to eclipse rivals with its distinctive, easy-to-use designs. The iMac and the iPod continue to be firm favourites among laptop computer buyers and music fans.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Google's once dazzling star has waned slightly as America's economic slowdown has eaten into online advertising and investors have wondered how the company can produce solid profits from expensive ventures such as the video-sharing website YouTube.</p> <p>Scott Kessler, an equities analyst specialising in technology at Standard &amp; Poor's in New York, said the twin fortunes of Apple and Google were central to the technological landscape: \"These are the two companies most currently identified with the notion of innovation - not just in Silicon Valley or in this country but arguably in the world.\"</p> <p>The milestone amounts to a reassertion of success by an older technological generation. Apple was founded by schoolfriends Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak in 1976 making it elderly in comparison to Google which has only existed for 10 years. </p> <p>Experts say Apple's distinctive skill is its ability to reinvent itself with new products which are typically kept secret until the last possible moment.</p> <p>\"It's one of the few companies that has been able to internally develop a number of blockbuster products and killer applications,\" said Kessler.</p> <p>Apple fans tend to attribute a large chunk of the company's success to the personal entrepreneurial instincts of Jobs, who is chief executive and is heavily involved in product development. When Jobs appeared to be gaunt and thinner than usual, Apple's stock briefly slumped last night before the company scotched rumours that he was ill.</p> <p>While Apple and Google differ widely in their business models, they have a degree of personal overlap. Google's chief executive, Eric Schmidt, sits on Apple's board as a non-executive director. The companies are based barely five miles apart in a sprawling hi-tech corridor running south of San Francisco. Apple is in the town of Cupertino while Google is in neighbouring Mountain View.</p> <p>Neither company offered any immediate reaction to the shift in supremacy. Apple did not return calls and a Google spokesman said: \"We never comment on our stock price.\"</p> <p>However, Apple has had few qualms about boasting of its prowess in the past. When the company's value overtook the computer maker Dell two years ago, Jobs sent out a companywide email reminding staff that Dell's founder had once predicted Apple's imminent demise.</p> <p>\"Team, it turned out that Michael Dell wasn't perfect at predicting the future,\" wrote Jobs. \"Stocks go up and down, and things may be different tomorrow, but I thought it was worth a moment of reflection today.\"</p> <p>For Apple, the iPhone has provided an edge in creativity and convenience. When a 3G version of the phone came out last month, Apple sold a million of the handsets in a single weekend.</p> <p>Google is comfortably the global leader in online searches but has seen slowing growth in \"paid clicks\" - the number of times users alight on lucrative advertisements. Google says this is because better tailored advertising has led to better quality, but less numerous, clicks.</p> <p>Google's shares, which topped $700 late last year, have settled back to just over $500 - but the company's founders, Sergey Brin, 34, and Larry Page, 35, remain billionaires who travel the world on a customised Boeing 767. </p> <p>The pair see conquering space as their next challenge and have put up a $20m prize to anyone who produces a privately financed spacecraft able to land on the moon.</p> <h2>Head-to-head</h2> <p><strong>Apple</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 Founded in a bedroom in Los Altos, California, by schoolfriends Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak in 1976</p> <p>\u00b7 Recently settled a long trademark battle with the Beatles' record company Apple Corps, over use of the word \"apple\" to sell music</p> <p>\u00b7 Began as a computer manufacturer and has diversified into iPod media players, iTunes online music sales and, most recently, iPhone touchscreen mobile phones</p> <p>\u00b7 Apple's iTunes website has sold more than 5bn songs</p> <p>\u00b7 Annual sales of $24bn and profits of $3.5bn</p> <p><strong>Google</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 Established by Stanford University graduates Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 1998</p> <p>\u00b7 Based initially in a garage in Menlo Park, California</p> <p>\u00b7 Named after the word googol - which is the number one followed by one hundred zeros</p> <p>\u00b7 Has expanded from a powerful internet search engine into online applications such as word processing and spreadsheet tools, and owns the video-sharing website YouTube</p> <p>\u00b7 The company slogan is \"don't be evil\"</p> <p>\u00b7 Annual revenue of $16.6bn and profits of $4.2bn</p>",
  "<p>Peter Gabriel isn't sure if he's meant to be saying this - it's the kind of thing <br>that could get a former secretary-general of the UN into trouble - but he's talking about the project that prevented him joining last year's Genesis reunion. \"Kofi Annan was saying the fact that he didn't have the security council on his back every single move was enormously liberating.\" Annan hasn't been in the studio with Gabriel; he's part of the latest stage of Gabriel's vaultingly ambitious career, serving as one of the 12 members of the Elders, a group of statesmen and women - including Nelson Mandela, Aung San Suu Kyi and Jimmy Carter - Gabriel helped convene to deal with global problems.</p> <p>Ambition has been a constant in Gabriel's career. He co-founded Genesis while still at school, only to leave them in 1975 for a massively successful solo career. Not content with that, he helped to transform the world music scene by promoting international artists through the Womad festivals and Real World record label. And now the Elders.</p> <p>Gabriel has found himself too busy to devote his full attention even to that - he missed this summer's meeting because he had just become a father for the fourth time, at the age of 58. All of which has meant little time for making new music. It's six years since Gabriel released Up, his last studio album, but he does appear on a new Real World release, for which he was co-curator. It's called Big Blue Ball, and consists of collaborations by artists from around the world who came together for what Gabriel called Recording Weeks, held at Gabriel's studios in Wiltshire in 1991, 1992 and 1995, with extra vocals added to one song last year. But why has it taken so long to be completed? \"That's pretty quick, I'd say!\" retorts Gabriel. \"Normally, in a recording studio, you chop away as you go, but with this there was no time. There was a mountain that needed clearing and sorting, and every time someone looked at it, vertigo was the result. And I'm a perfectionist, so it took a while to satisfy me as well.\"</p> <p>Big Blue Ball is a perfect Gabriel project: it combines his fascination with technology, experimentation and music from around the world. The motivating idea was \"creative anarchy and allowing interesting things to happen\", and the results include a glorious collaboration between Natacha Atlas, an Egyptian string section and percussionist Hossam Ramzy, and a song featuring Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor, Chinese flute player Guo Yue, and Sevara Nazarkhan from Uzbekistan. Then there are the tracks involving Gabriel himself, including a rousing number with drummer Billy Cobham. \"Most of the tracks started with a groove,\" he says. I'm a big groove fan - and a failed drummer. It's still that, and passionate singing, that brings me into a lot of music.\"</p> <p>The project could never have been long-running, he says, \"because we never found a way to make it pay for itself - but I'd love to do it again. It was among the most exciting musical moments I have ever had. We may have dreams of women and money, but fun is still the motive for a lot of people starting in music, and there's nothing like being with a group of musicians and generating something that hasn't existed before.\" </p> <p>Big Blue Ball is part of Gabriel's ongoing quest to bring new music to audiences. \"It's a bit like food,\" he says. \"The taste may be a little foreign at first, but after a while you get to like it. If we can absorb the world, which we need to do, that is part of a globalisation process. I have a lot of sympathy for the anti-globalisation movement, but I think it's the wrong word. Womad has always been a globalisation festival to me.\" </p> <p>The Womad festival is now as much part of the British musical summer as Glastonbury - this was it's 26th year - and there is now a global network of Womad events. Has it achieved what Gabriel wanted? \"Like all good evangelists, we'd love it to have taken over the world, but it has opened a lot of doors for a lot of artists, and for that, everyone involved feels very proud. It's the only festival I know of that's been exported.\" </p> <p>But could it become a victim of its own success, now that artists from around the world are staples of so many other festivals? With the departure this year of Thomas Brooman, Womad's co-founder and original artistic director, Gabriel suggests there could be changes. \"I'm looking at different ways of opening up Womad, so I hope some of the original ideas might be looked at again. Originally we were trying to do more with poetry, film and art and it would be great to find a way of getting more of that.\"</p> <p>There might also be more younger bands, especially after the intriguing work combining British and African musicians in the Africa Express project, started by Damon Albarn and others as an angry reaction to the lack of African musicians at Live 8. Gabriel sees what they are doing as a continuation of the Recording Weeks concept. \"I'm sure they wouldn't appreciate being told that,\" he says. \"But I do see a connection. At the first Womad, we had Echo and the Bunnymen playing with the Burundi drummers.\"</p> <p>So what next? He says there will be a new album soon, possibly next year. And he's recorded for an album called Scratch My Back, in which artists cover each other's songs. And then there's his involvement with the Elders, the concept of which sprang from a conversation with Richard Branson in 1999. The aim was \"getting a group of superheroes to work together - I do think that governments are in some ways the record companies of the governance world, in the sense that the old models are redundant in some areas.\" He hopes this group of veteran politicians and activists, currently chaired by Desmond Tutu, will be able to offer advice on issues such as conflict resolution: \"If you have the Elders, whose phone calls will not be refused and rejected by any statesman, you have some means of influencing events.\"</p> <p>And did he really have to make the choice between meetings with Mandela, Tutu and co and singing The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway? It seems so. The Elders, said Gabriel \"was a once-in-a lifetime opportunity and more pressing for me than a Genesis reunion, even though it could be fun to do some time. But it's not necessarily something I would want to live in.\" Meaning? \"It's a nice place to visit but not somewhere you want to move back to necessarily.\" It's not, perhaps, the Real World.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Big Blue Ball is out now on Real World Records via Proper</p>",
  "<p>A Free Tibet video on YouTube was taken down under the International Olympic Committee's intellectual-property deal with the internet site.</p> <p>The video features a protest last Thursday night in which demonstrators are holding a vigil by candlelight during which they projected on to the wall of the Chinese consular building in New York images of Tibetan monks being arrested. The video then showed the five Olympic rings, which proceed digitally to morph into handcuffs.</p> <p>Several Free Tibet and technology blogs that had monitored the situation claimed that the IOC had \"abused\" its rights to YouTube's claim-your-content policy, accusing it of \"censorship\".</p> <p>\"The video is a crystal clear case of fair use - it's 100% legal and non-infringing -and the IOC has absolutely no right to force the video out of view,\" said an article on the online television website, Getmiro.com.</p> <p>Giselle Davies, the IOC's director of communications, said the clip's removal had been due to the intervention of a computer programme set up to tackle copyright infringements. \"A YouTube video containing the Olympic marque was taken down by automated copyright-protection software,\" she said. \"This was the result of the system operating automatically to prevent the illegal uploading of Olympic content.\"</p> <p>Davies said the video had been reinstated to YouTube but, needless to say, the video cannot be accessed from the Olympics' main press centre.</p> <p><strong>Ban the blazers, says Coe<br></strong><br>Sebastian Coe is threatening to impose a ban on Olympic officials at the London 2012 opening athletes' parade. The Beijing procession turned into a farce when numerous blazers marched in ahead of the athletes. Coe never attended an opening ceremony during any Games at which he was competing, considering the long waits to be detrimental to his performance. While he will take steps to make the long ceremony more \"benign\" for athletes, Coe wants to build a bonfire of officials' vanities. \"You don't want to spend 30 seconds looking for the [athletes] and wondering where they are,\" said Coe. \"It's not about the administrators of the world being hand in hand.\"<br><strong><br>Tribute to coach and dad</strong></p> <p>The International Association of Athletics Federations held its council meeting on Tuesday and paid tribute with a minute's silence to Coe's late father, Peter, who passed away last Saturday. The gesture recognised his status as a successful, self-taught coach who after reading textbooks of East German techniques inspired his son to become the British athlete who broke more world records than any other.</p> <p><strong>Tom needs a little Jerry </strong></p> <p>As Steve Foley, Britain's performance director for diving, investigates the causes of the breakdown in the relationship between Tom Daley and Blake Aldridge, he might wish first to focus on giving the 14-year-old his childhood back. Despite the media scrutiny on Daley, it has escaped most people's notice that Chen Ruolin and Wang Xin, above, the winners of the women's 10m synchronised diving for China on Tuesday, were 15 and 16 years old respectively. Chen revealed that whenever nerves struck she thought back to a visit to Disneyland in California, spending her spare time watching Tom and Jerry DVDs. Which makes a change from Daley's endorsement-heavy speeches.<br><strong><br>Haze over 'green' claim </strong></p> <p>Beijing's billing as the \"green\" Games stretches credulity to a point off the scale. Having begun with giant pyrotechnic footprints, these Olympics have been expanding their carbon profile with the fleet of buses that sit in the parking lots around the Olympic park.

  "<p>Poland and the United States struck a deal that will see a missile defence battery in the ex-communist state and deepen military ties, a plan that has infuriated Moscow and sparked fears in Europe of a new arms race.</p> <p>\"We have crossed the Rubicon,\" the Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Thursday, referring to US consent to Poland's demands after more than 18 months of talks.</p> <p>In an interview on news channel TVN24, Tusk said the United States had agreed to help augment Poland's defences with Patriot missiles in exchange for placing 10 missile defence interceptors in the eastern European country.</p> <p>He said the deal also includes a \"mutual commitment\" between the two nations to come to each other's assistance \"in case of trouble.\"</p> <p>The clause on mutual assistance appeared to be a direct and potent reference to Russia, which has threatened to aim missiles toward Poland - a former Soviet satellite - if it agreed to host the US site.</p> <p>Washington says the system, which does not yet work, is needed to protect the US and Europe from possible attacks from so-called rogue states, including Iran.</p> <p>However, Poland has all along been guided by fears of a newly resurgent Russia.</p> <p>Russia's lightning-quick incursion into Georgia, along with its bombing of military outposts and airfields there, has underlined a palpable fear in the region of Russia's renewed vigor and confidence.</p> <p>In past days, Polish leaders said that the war justified Poland's demands that it get additional security guarantees in exchange for allowing the site on its soil.</p> <p>But after the deal was announced, both US and Polish officials attempted to play down any connection to the Georgian war.</p> <p>\"This is not linked to the situation in Georgia,\" the chief US negotiator John Rood told The Associated Press. \"We had made these arrangements for this round of negotiations before the conflict in Georgia, and so we just merely continued with the schedule we had.\"</p> <p>In Washington, White House spokeswoman Dana Perino also said the timing was not meant to further antagonise Russia. \"We believe that missile defence is a substantial contribution to NATO's collective security,\" she said.</p> <p>In initial reaction from Russia, the parliamentary foreign affairs committee chairman Konstantin Kosachev was quoted by Interfax news agency as saying the agreement will spark \"a real rise in tensions in Russian-American relations.\" </p> <p>He also said that plan targets Russia - a claim strongly denied by Washington.</p> <p>After Tusk announced the deal, it went through an initial signing ceremony late Thursday in Warsaw, but still needs approval from Poland's government and parliament, and a final signing from US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice at a yet unspecified date.</p> <p>At the signing, Poland's Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski said the deal would strengthen the US, Poland and NATO. Earlier this year, NATO endorsed the US plan to expand its global missile defence shield with the planned site in Poland and a linked radar tracking base in the Czech Republic.</p> <p>\"Only evil people should be afraid of our agreement,\" Sikorski told reporters after Rood and his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Kremer, initialed the agreement at the Foreign Ministry.</p> <p>The US has also reached an agreement with the Czech government to place the radar component of the shield in that country. That deal still needs approval from Czech parliament.</p>",
  "<p>Prince Charles's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/13/prince.charles.gm.farming?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=media\">passionate tirade</a> against GM crops has brought <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a73e8580-69a3-11dd-91bd-0000779fd18c.html\">a predictable response</a> from those with an interest in the technology. Biotech scientists have queued up to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/13/gmcrops.food\">denounce</a> his criticisms as \"ill-informed\". </p> <p>They point out that GM crops are already being grown safely by 12 million farmers around the world. It would be morally indefensible, they claim, to ignore a technology that might provide solutions to the challenges of climate change and farmland degradation.</p> <p>The Prince <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7558585.stm\">is also accused</a> of a indulging in a scatter-gun \"rant\" against urbanisation and globalisation as if everything was the result of GM technology, which clearly it isn't.</p> <p>Still, he must have expected this sort of reaction from the research industry. Over the years, they've been bankrolled to the tune of many billions of pounds from both the taxpayer and agribusiness corporations. Few areas of research have provided so many jobs for scientists.</p> <p>Such is our reverence for cutting-edge science that it's not difficult for the research establishment to mobilise powerful support when it comes under attack. A Times leader the day after the Prince's outburst <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/leading_article/article4526157.ece\">dismissed his utterances</a> on GM crops as \"obscurantism, reaction and superstition\".</p> <p>Despite the clamour, however, he is, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/13/gmcrops.food\">as John Vidal observes</a>, essentially right. The widespread adoption of GM crops may well threaten the world's food supply. It will probably throw millions of small farmers off the land, and it will almost certainly produce shanty cities of the sort he calls \"unsustainable, unmanageable, degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unimaginable awfulness\". While GM technology may not be the direct cause of such horrors, it will perpetuate the system of industrial agriculture that makes them inevitable.</p> <p>It's a threat acknowledged in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/apr/16/food.biofuels\">a 2008 report</a> from the World Bank and UN agencies. Based on the work of more than 400 scientists, it concludes that the present system of food production \u2013 and the way food is traded \u2013 have led to an unequal distribution of benefits and to serious ecological damage. It was also contributing, the report found, to climate change.</p> <p>The report's authors reject the idea that GM crops have a significant part to play in ending world hunger. What they want to see is more research targeted at protecting soils, water and forests. \"We urgently need sustainable ways to produce food,\" says <a href=\"\">Professor Robert Watson</a>, director of multi-disciplinary group which produced the report. At its launch, a group of eight international environmental and consumer organisations commented: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"This is a sobering account of the failure of industrial farming. Small-scale farmers using ecological methods provide the way forward to avert the food crisis and meet the needs of communities.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The World Bank report merely confirms what shrewd farmers have always known \u2013 that small, mixed family farms produce more food per hectare than large farms. This applies equally to northern, industrial countries as to the south.</p> <p>In Britain, George Henderson wrote a best-selling book called <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Farming-Ladder-Third-Impression/dp/B0014BTQTK\">The Farming Ladder</a> setting out how simple it would be to feed the population of these islands by switching to small-scale mixed farming. He proved it on the small farm he and his brother ran in the Cotswolds. During the second world war, it was producing so much food that the government brought farmers from all over Britain to look at it in the hope that they'd go home and do it themselves.</p> <p>Tragically, governments around the world now use public subsidies to swap mixed farming for large-scale, intensive cropping. This system of food production <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/12/biofuels.food\">is inherently unstable</a>. It relies on huge inputs of fossil energy in the form of pesticides, nitrate fertilisers, diesel and machinery. And it steadily degrades the soil, making farmland less and less productive.</p> <p>Large agribusiness companies \u2013 together with their supporters in public science \u2013 are now promoting GM crops as the solution to problems they themselves have created. It's a sticking plaster solution to a wound that urgently needs to be cleaned up. If we really want a safe and sustainable supply of food, we must acknowledge that large-scale grain production has failed and needs to be replaced by small mixed farms. Whether or not GM crops have a role in sustaining this sort of farming <em>is</em> a legitimate question for research.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the Prince's own dedication to organic farming makes him a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/feb/27/guardiancolumnists\">less effective advocate</a> of reform than he deserves to be. Dominated as it is by the producer interest, the organic movement has allowed itself to be turned into a lucrative brand. Its contribution to the debate on sustainable agriculture has been blunted by supermarkets, which are happy to see it relegated to niche market status. </p> <p>Nevertheless, Prince Charles is to be applauded for raising these issues: he deserves a pat on the back for speaking up.</p>",
  "<p>July 8 2005 was a dark day for two Olympic sports \u2013 as baseball and softball were voted out of the Games from 2012. The International Baseball Federation would be forced to reapply in order to get back into the Games at the IOC assembly in Copenhagen in October 2009 - a huge blow for proponents of both sports in countries where they tend to fly under the radar. It was especially painful for the British Baseball Federation; two days earlier we had learnt that London, not Paris, would follow Beijing as an Olympic host city, meaning that GB would've had an automatic place in both baseball and softball for the first time, likely leading to increased funding and a spike in popularity. Instead the golden springboard was swiped from under their feet.</p> <p>It's anything but routine for sports to be voted out of the Games; it hadn't happened in nearly 70 years, since polo was ousted from the Olympic programme. Baseball and softball's removal took place three years after IOC members had resisted president Jacques Rogge's proposal that those two sports, along with modern pentathlon, should be dropped and replaced with sports on the waiting list - rugby and golf. </p> <p>From a political point of view, it seemed that baseball was being punished for the way it drug tested athletes and punished offenders. From a competition point of view, there was frustration that Major League Baseball refused to pause its season and release its best players to represent their countries. There are no big leaguers on the current United States roster, while Japan features some players from Nippon Professional Baseball. Personally, I feel badly for the world's softball players, who have undoubtedly suffered from guilt by bat and ball association. Spare a thought for Cuba as well; winners of three of the last four tournaments, Cubanos treasure Olympic baseball like no other nation.</p> <p>So Beijing's eight-team round-robin tournament could represent the swansong for Olympic baseball, a sport which has appeared 13 times since the Stockholm Games of 1912, becoming an official medal event in Barcelona 16 years ago. It has been said that the demise of both baseball and softball is partially due to anti-American feelings in the influential European IOC camp. Exhibit A involves modern pentathlon, a less popular pursuit, but one steeped in Olympic tradition and supposedly well supported by European IOC members \u2013 it survived the 2005 vote while the American sports did not. Those members from the continent, unaware that baseball has a substantial history in Europe, should brush up for the 2009 vote and pick up a copy of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Baseball-Europe-Country-History/dp/0786437243\">Baseball in Europe: A Country by Country History by Josh Chetwynd</a>, who once played professionally in Sweden and currently co-hosts Five's live Major League Baseball coverage in the UK.</p> <p>The volume, unrivaled in its description of baseball's presence on the other side of the Atlantic, could persuade European members that they voted wrong back in 2005. It offers colourful, comprehensive coverage of baseball history in countries such as Croatia, Britain, Russia/USSR, the Czech Republic, Belgium, the Netherlands and Italy, and also includes round-ups of every baseball European Championships ever held. It also has a handy international glossary of baseball terms, where I discovered how to say \"shutout\" in Italian: \"<em>Partita in cui gli avversari non segnano</em>\", and \"umpire\" in German: \"<em>Schiedsrichter</em>\".</p> <p>The definitive guide to baseball in Europe excels in its storytelling, notably in the recapping of baseball's appearance at the infamous 1936 Berlin Olympics. Chetwynd explains that Adolf Hitler and his mistress Eva Braun, became somewhat infatuated with baseball, and that a young middle infielder named Dow Wilson spoke with the F\u00fchrer regularly during the Games. Wilson, then oblivious to Hitler's policies and beliefs, recalled his brush with the dictator. \"I was 19, what do 19-year-olds talk about,\" he said. \"[Hitler] was polite and seemed like a nice man who obviously became a very bad man.\"</p> <p>Wilson could never figure out why they were so fixated with ballplayers. Hitler was in attendance at Olympic Stadium for the split-squad game made up of Americans, sitting in his box which was worryingly in play near the right field line. Although players were warned by a Nazi official not to hit balls to the right, several shots headed in the dictator's direction during batting practice - unfortunately never hitting the F\u00fchrer. Had the players been a bit more accurate, history may have been changed forever.</p> <p>Seventy-two years later, baseball is on its way out of the Olympic scene. It makes little sense, especially as America's \"national pastime\" continues to enjoy unprecedented global popularity, with more countries than ever able to put out competitive teams. The IOC needs to put aside any lingering ill will and restore baseball and softball in time for 2016.</p>",

  "<p> Several generations of a family in Katine. Photograph: Dan Chung</p> <p>\"Can we, together, lift one village out of the Middle Ages?...Alan Rusbridger travels a few hours from London - and 700 years back in time.\"</p> <p>I was pretty shocked when I read <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/2007/oct/20/about\">the above</a></strong>. Alan Rusbridger was paraphrasing Paul Collier, an influential economist at Oxford University. Collier writes that poor people live in, \"a reality that is the 14th century.\" It is an economist's view of the world dominated by welfare and income measures.</p> <p>Katine, like everywhere else, only exists in the present. It belongs to the modern world, and is part of a much larger story of globalisation, capitalism and the mixed and unequal blessings of development. Though it may be at the bottom end, Katine has been part of the global economy for more than a century. Like everywhere else, life in the area has been shaped by colonialism, the politics of the Cold War, the policies of the World Bank and the IMF, and the forces of <strong><a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/katine/2008/07/will_the_g8_do_anything_for_af.html\">globalisation</a></strong>.</p> <p>It is not distant drumming that wakes people up in the morning in Katine, but <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/video/2007/oct/20/music.lifestyle\">the sound of Dolly Parton</a></strong>.</p> <p>Past experiences influence the present and explain how people engage with <strong><a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/katine/2008/07/how_the_katines_political_hist.html\">development initiatives</a></strong>. If we want to get a sense of the present in Katine, then we need to know something of the past.</p> <p>The biggest change in Katine over the past hundred years has been colonialism. Colonialism can be thought of as an early version of globalisation, a time when ideas, people and capital were exchanged on a global scale. In eastern Uganda colonialism can be summed up by three \"Cs\": cotton, chiefs and Christianity.</p> <p>The main reason behind the colonial conquest of Teso (the region that Katine is part of) was to ensure a reliable supply of cotton within the British Empire. This was part of an attempt to safeguard the imperial cotton trade after the shock of the American Civil War. Cotton from Teso was to be exported to the mills in the north of England and, from there, sold as cloth on the international market. By 1905-1910 the people of the Teso region had been forced into cotton production.</p> <p>The transformation of Teso was achieved through coercion and violence. The Iteso are \"acephalous\", meaning that they are non-hierarchical. Before the British there were no chiefs in Teso. This presented problems for the colonial policy of indirect rule. There was no local elite for the British to co-opt. Instead, men from neighbouring regions had to be imported to make Teso governable. These \"chiefs\" lacked local legitimacy and were seen as violent and oppressive. From the outset chiefs were entitled to part of the earnings and labour of those they administered.</p> <p>Before the British the Iteso were pastoralists. They moved about the place with their cattle, rather than having a fixed address. Cotton meant the settling down of the population so that they could cultivate individual plots of land and pay taxes.</p> <p>As time passed, a new \"chiefly\" class was educated from the local population. But the development of Teso was always problematic and very much on colonial terms. Africans were limited to local administration and farming. The right to trade was reserved for Asians - mostly Gujurat.</p> <p>The colonial experiment was deemed an enormous \"success\" by the British. Cotton production transformed the fortunes of Uganda, from a place dependent on grants from London to a self-financing protectorate. Instead of being stuck in the Middle Ages, Teso was regarded as one of the most developmental corners of the British Empire. By the 1930s colonial officials described the region in the following terms: \"No portion of the protectorate has displayed more spectacular progress.\"</p> <p>One of the paradoxes of the present is that this situation has reversed itself. Today Uganda is again dependent on outside donors, while the <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/2008/jul/09/background.livelihoods\">rural economy is neglected</a></strong>.</p> <p>Alongside cotton and chiefs, colonialism introduced a third \"C\" - Christianity - into the Teso region. In many ways Christianity has been the most important and enduring <strong><a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/katine/2008/08/diary_damaged_lives.html\">development in the area</a></strong>.</p> <p>For many on the left, Christianity is regarded as the handmaiden of capitalism. A system of beliefs that helped establish colonialism in Africa. And Catholic and Anglican missions provided places where the economic and political practices required of a \"progressive\" society were given religious narratives. There was the seven-day week, the special status of the Sabbath, new modes of dress and conduct, the moral value of literacy and numeracy, of being \"civilized\". Chiefs were educated in mission schools.</p> <p>And yet Christianity came to mean much more to people. As villagers took on the roles of catechist and congregant, Christianity evolved and changed. Church attendance was incorporated into prevailing notions of sociality and respectability, while Christian forms of worship and prayer offered a sense of community in a rapidly changing world.</p> <p>The evolving relationship between chiefs, cotton and Christianity is also part of our own story of development. Cotton from Teso made mill owners in the north of England rich, and helped build an Indian middle class in East Africa. In Britain, the Archbishop of York is Ugandan and many of our most active religious congregations are African-led.</p> <p>If we are to make sense of developments in Katine then we have to start from the understanding that Katine is poor and marginalised because it is part of our present, not because it exists in some sort of parallel, distant universe.</p> <p>Next time, I will write about the post-colonial history of the area.

  "<p>New research led by two University of California at Berkeley biologists finds frogs and other amphibians worldwide need help, because they are dying at alarming rates.</p> <p>The researchers find that some frog populations are at 2 to 5% of their former size - that's a decline of 95 to 98% - which they argue is a warning sign of a larger global issue.</p> <p>An article published this week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reports that scientists are not yet sure what the long-term implications might be.</p> <p>They are sure, however, of the varied causes of the die-off, and say mankind is to blame for most of them.</p> <p>David Wake, a professor of integrative biology at the University of California at Berkeley, said the die-off can be pinned to three factors - habitat destruction; a naturally occurring fungus, which researchers say is not unique to dead frogs they found in the Sierra Nevada; and introduced species, which present an imbalance in amphibious habitats. For example, the first hint of frog decline in California came in the 1990s, when scientists believed rainbow trout introduced in the area by humans were feeding on tadpoles and frog eggs.</p> <p>\"It's not a one-two punch,\" Wake said. \"It's more of a one, two, three, four punch.\"</p> <p>The \"fourth punch,\" Wake said, is climate change, which is showing dramatic effects on aquatic-dwelling species worldwide.</p> <p>\"There is no place in California where frogs are still thriving,\" Wake said.</p> <p>Fewer frogs eating insects - like West Nile-carrying mosquitoes - is just one example of how a major blow to global ecology could cause a shift in the grand food chain, though Wake would not equate the possible spreading of West Nile virus to the frog die-off.</p> <p>Wake and his colleague Vance Vredenburg studied amphibian populations in the Sierra Nevada and say they have observed frogs carcasses in remote peaks - places they are expected to thrive.</p> <p>In 2004, researchers found that one-third of amphibian species around the world are threatened with extinction, according to a University of California-Berkeley release on the subject at that time.</p> <p>Wake suggested mass extinctions should prompt more focus on the study of pathology, as decimated frog populations could easily mean a change in the ways diseases are transmitted in human populations.</p> <p>\"We've got to invest a lot more in research of the ecology of infectious disease,\" Wake said. Drastic shifts in the ecology affects \"how it spreads through the environment\".</p>",
  "<p>As well as boiling an egg and washing socks, another first for many students is planning - or at least thinking about - their budget. </p> <p>According to the government it costs on average \u00a310,980 a year to be a student. The <a href=\"http://www.natwest.com/global/media/y2007/m-5.ashx\">NatWest student money survey</a> puts it even higher - at \u00a311,580. Either way, over three years it will cost you at least \u00a333,000 to complete your degree. </p> <p>The advice from everyone - the NUS, the banks, the government, your parents - is that before you go you should draw up a budget so you know what to expect. Once you have done that, you can work out how best to allocate money you have coming in from grants, loans and the bank of mum and dad.</p> <h2>Working out your costs</h2> <p>First, work out broadly what you need to budget for. For each expense consider if it covers the whole year or just term time. If you have to live away from home for the whole year you will spend a lot more than if you are away just for the eight months of term time. </p> <p>Think about the big, fixed-cost things first. Your course fees will be top of that list, followed by rent and books. Do you have to pay your fees at the start of each year, or each term? Do you pay rent as a one-off sum or monthly to a private landlord? What about the deposit? </p> <p>Then think about your monthly costs. Rent might be in here, as well as household bills like electricity and gas, your mobile bill, internet connection, travel card and clothes. </p> <p>Think about your weekly expenditure next - this will probably be mainly food and going out. Be honest about this - there is no point pretending you won't spend money socialising as a student.</p> <p>Finally consider one-off big-ticket items that you will need, for example a new laptop or microwave.<br> Once you have your list, it's time to write down what it will all cost. Then you can work out how much you have coming in, and decide where that money should be spent first. </p> <h2>Example budget</h2> <p>To give you an example of which expenses to include, and how those costs add up, we've drawn up a sample budget. We've assumed our student is staying in halls over the eight months of term time and doesn't have to pay rent in the holidays. She also doesn't have any gas or electricity bills \u2013 those in rented flats will have to take these into consideration. Her budget will look something like this:</p> <p><strong>At the start of term one</strong><br>\u00b7 Course fees: \u00a31,500 a year<br>\u00b7 Accommodation: \u00a3900 a term<br>\u00b7 Books: \u00a3300 a year<br>\u00b7 Insurance: \u00a365 a year (or pay monthly by direct debit)<br>\u00b7 TV licence: \u00a3139 (or pay monthly by direct debit)<br><strong>Total over three terms: \u00a34,704</strong></p> <p><strong>Weekly expenditure</strong><br>\u00b7 Food: \u00a335<br>\u00b7 Going out: \u00a325<br>\u00b7 Travel: \u00a314<br>\u00b7 Laundry: \u00a33<br>\u00b7 Phone: \u00a35<br><strong>Total over three terms (31 weeks): \u00a32,542</strong></p> <p><strong>One-offs</strong><br>\u00b7 Laptop: \u00a3400<br>\u00b7 Field trips: \u00a360<br><strong>Total: \u00a3460</strong></p> <p><strong>Grand total for the year: \u00a37,706</strong></p> <h2>Working out your income</h2> <p>A student's income will come from several different sources, and at several different times of year. Usually it will include a mix of loans for fees and living costs (the \"maintenance\" loan), a means-tested grant from the government up to \u00a32,835, a bursary from the college or university of up to \u00a33,000 (but on average \u00a31,000). A full list of what is available is on the <a href=\"http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/EducationAndLearning/UniversityAndHigherEducation/StudentFinance/FinanceForNewStudents/DG_10034859\">Directgov website</a>.</p> <p>An <a href=\"http://www.studentfinancedirect.co.uk/portal/page?_pageid=53,1262820&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL\">online calculator</a> can help you work out how much you can get from each source.</p> <p>On top of that, include money from any jobs you might do in term time or the holidays, and any financial support you get from your parents.</p> <h2>Example income</h2> <p>To give you an idea of how much you can expect, our student's income looks like this:</p> <p><strong>Income from official sources</strong><br>\u00b7 Tuition fee loan: \u00a31,500 a year (maximum \u00a33,145)<br>\u00b7 Maintenance loan: \u00a32,500 (maximum \u00a36,475)<br>\u00b7 Grant: \u00a31,200 (maximum \u00a32,835)<br>\u00b7 Bursary: \u00a31,000<br><strong>Total: \u00a36,200</strong></p> <p><strong>Income from unofficial sources includes</strong><br>\u00b7 Part time job, earning \u00a345 a week<br>\u00b7 Parental support of \u00a3150 a term<br><strong>Total for a 10-week term: \u00a3600.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/britishairways\">British Airways</a> today unveiled plans for a global alliance with American Airlines that will allow cooperation on fares and schedules - prompting warnings from rivals that passengers will be hit by higher ticket prices as a result.</p> <p>BA chief executive Willie Walsh said the agreement, which must be cleared by competition authorities in the US and EU, would offer consumers more destinations and a wider choice of fares. </p> <p>The partnership will cover 493 destinations in 121 different countries and will, according to BA, give British customers more reliable and cheaper journeys to US destinations. However, Virgin Atlantic warned that it would give BA and AA control over nearly two-thirds of one of the most lucrative markets in aviation: Heathrow Airport to New York's JFK.</p> <p>\"There is no reason why fares should go up as a result of this. For the consumer it means they will have access to a much bigger network. We will coordinate our schedules to make it easier to connect between airlines and you will have greater access to cheaper fares,\" said Walsh. </p> <p>The BA boss added that passengers on transatlantic routes will be able to choose between BA and AA fares when they book flights - allowing them to choose the cheapest fare on both legs of a return journey. \"There will be nothing to stop the customer from taking a fare with AA outbound and taking a fare with BA on the inbound leg.\"</p> <p>Virgin Atlantic, BA's closest rival in the UK to US market, laid down a marker as the most vehement opponent of the agreement, which faces months of scrutiny from competition watchdogs on both sides of the Atlantic. Paul Charles, the airline's director of communications, said: \"It is anti-competitive. It will force up fares and it will mean that passengers get a worse service, because if you get rid of competitors by combining BA with AA you have got no one snapping at your heels to make you improve your product.\"</p> <p>Walsh hit back with arguments that will be heard by Department of Transport officials in Washington over the next few months, saying that the recent liberalisation of the transatlantic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/theairlineindustry\">airline market </a>by the Open Skies treaty had created an open market in Heathrow-to-US flights. </p> <p>The treaty scrapped provisions that limited the Heathrow-to-JFK route to four airlines when it was introduced in March this year. Walsh said Open Skies was the biggest difference between now and seven years ago, when BA's application for an alliance with AA foundered on regulatory fears over access to Heathrow. \"This is an open market and that is the big difference between now and 2001. Anybody can come in and compete.\"</p> <p>Walsh ruled out selling Heathrow slots as a makeweight in any regulatory probe - a precondition that led to BA abandoning the previous attempt at an AA alliance. Spain's Iberia, Finnair and Royal Jordanian are also applying for anti-trust immunity as part of the alliance, but the probe by competition watchdogs is expected to focus on the transatlantic market.</p>",
  "<p>Europe's biggest travel company <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/tuitravel\">TUI Travel</a> today reported a 39% rise in profits today but announced sharp cuts in the number of holidays it sells in the UK, in light of the worsening economic outlook and to take out excess capacity following last year's merger with First Choice.</p> <p>TUI reported operating profits of \u00a365.4m for the three months to June, up from \u00a347m a year ago. Turkey, Egypt, Cyprus, Greece and Italy were popular holiday destinations this summer. Winter bookings so far are mainly to Egypt, Mexico, the Dominican Republic and ski resorts. </p> <p>The company said it would reduce supply in Britain by 21% this winter by operating six fewer aircraft, and cut the number of holiday packages next summer by 15% when it will run 11 fewer planes. It is selling fewer \"late\" packages which are often heavily discounted. </p> <p>Holiday packages offered this summer were cut by 10%, and most have now been sold in the UK. Rival <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/thomascookgroup\">Thomas Cook</a> has reduced capacity by 7% and said it has scope to cut by another 15% if needed.</p> <p>\"We continue to prepare the business to deal with any consequences of the current economic climate,\" said TUI chief executive Peter Long. \"There is gloom, but we have contingency plans.\" He added: \"Our capacity cuts for next year are not a sign that we believe customers will not go on holiday. They are about delivering our merger plans and cutting out unprofitable and duplicated product.\"</p> <p>Analysts at Numis welcomed the move, saying: \"Capacity can be added relatively easily if demand remains strong.\" </p> <p>To offset rising fuel costs and the impact of the strong euro, TUI is raising the cost of its holidays sold in the UK for 2009 by 6%, and by 2-4% in its other main markets. TUI expects to spend $1.8bn on jet fuel in the current year, equating to about 8% of revenues. </p> <p>The company echoed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/13/thomascookgroup.travelleisure\">Thomas Cook's positive outlook yesterday</a> saying that despite the credit crunch, people are still going on holiday, with no deterioration in cancellation rates, holiday length or accommodation mix. </p> <p>However, it has observed a shift from long-haul to medium-haul destinations. \"People's holiday is sacrosanct and our trading metrics show no evidence that customers are curtailing their holiday plans,\" Long said. \"We find that people are even more keen to get away on a great value holiday and relax in the sun when the economic environment gets more difficult.\"</p>",

Photograph: PR</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Skyscrapers are architecture's sunflowers. Given a good, sunny financial climate, they will soar into the urban firmament, blossoming extravagantly, heady, ostentatious symbols of high rolling cities. </p> <p>But, when the financial climate is poor, they refuse to grow so very high; and sometimes, as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/aug/14/britishland.cheesegrater\">in the case of British Land's \"Cheesegrater\" in the City of London</a>, they stay in the ground waiting for the good times to come again.</p> <p>The \"Cheesegrater\" is just one of several skyscrapers currently planned for the City of London and originally due for completion at much the same time - between 2010 and the opening of the 2012 Olympic Games. The seeds of this latest generation of high-rise buildings have been planted by developers. This is architecture as a cash crop, designed primarily not to adorn the City's skyline, but to generate ambitious and even sky-high profits.</p> <p>This is not to say that such buildings can't be inspiring and even beautiful; they can. One of the most aggressively commercial of all skyscrapers was the Empire State Building. Completed just in time to meet the full effects of the Wall Street Crash, this astonishing building \u2013 the tallest in the world in 1930 \u2013 stood mostly empty for the much of the 1930s. </p> <p>Known as the Empty State Building, its seemingly endless office floors only finally filled up after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour. Government war departments found a home here and the building came into its own. </p> <p>The Empire State Building, though, was always special. It was such an astonishing, bravura performance, that it somehow won the hearts of the majority of New Yorkers and became, instantly and despite its initial poor economic performance, a wonder of the modern world. Today, it's a national treasure and global tourist magnet as well as a busy commercial building that more than earns its keep. </p> <p>Manhattan, however, is dotted about with any number of dull built-to-let skyscrapers that, while looking good en-masse, especially when seen from a distance, are pretty disappointing as works of architecture when seen close up. </p> <p>These are very much gigantic machines for making money. In London, where there have been great concerns about the look and character of the skyline surrounding St Paul's Cathedral in recent years, there had been an attempt to make at least some of these big-buck buildings look half-decent. Developers have taken to employing architects like Richard Rogers (the \"Cheesegrater\") and Renzo Piano (London Bridge Tower, or the \"Glass Shard\") precisely because their talented firms are able to make ruthlessly commercial skyscrapers look good.</p> <p><strong>Reaching for the skies</strong></p> <p>Even so, the fate of these buildings, especially in their early stages of development, is very much at the mercy of economic swings. Their very height is determined by economic forecasts, although to build as high as both the \"Cheesegrater\" and the \"Glass Shard\" developers have to take a big gamble. Contemporary city skylines can almost be read as graphs of the ups and downs of the economy at any given time. When the going is good for developers, tall buildings reach as if for the stratosphere. When the going gets tough, the skyline dips.</p> <p>The City of London is, of course, a machine for making money. Much of its architecture over the past 25 years has been pretty horrendous stuff. In the Eighties boom, when flashy postmodernism was the vogue amongst architects and planners, many had something of the look of a shiny, padded-suited broker. More recently, City buildings have tended to resemble giant mobile phones. </p> <p>Although the \"Cheesegrater\" is among the better looking of the latest wave of City of London skyscrapers, many people in and out of London will breathe something of a sigh of relief that the recent high-rise boom has been curtailed by the current downturn in the economy. </p> <p>Here is a time to pause and to think of what the City of London might appear to be in a decade's time. Should it really have the look of today's Shanghai \u2013 which it increasingly does \u2013 or might it find its very own style again, as it did in the days of both Sir Christopher Wren (the late 17th and early 18th centuries) and of Sir Edwin Lutyens (the early to mid 20th century)? </p> <p>I guess, though, that the \"Cheesegrater\" and its rival City skyscrapers are simply biding their time. When the financial sun is shining brightly once more, these aggressive, and occasionally stylish, buildings will soar again, as high into the sky as any developer dares and as any City planner encourages them.</p>",
  "<p>A smart friend wonders whether the ongoing Georgia crisis may be changing Obama's veep calculus away from Evan Bayh and toward Joe Biden.</p> <p>I had thought Bayh had it very nearly in the bag, but this makes sense on a few counts. This crisis shows signs of lingering for a while. It could certainly flare up again in the fall. The United States could become much more deeply enmeshed in this. In sum, it could be an event that seriously alters the dynamics of this race. Biden's foreign-affairs experience may therefore come in awfully handy, not only on the stump but, if elected, once in office.</p> <p>Biden can go toe-to-toe with McCain on global questions with more authority than Bayh (or frankly Obama) can.

  "<p>Britain's honeybees have suffered <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/12/conservation.wildlife1\">catastrophic losses</a> this year according to the first survey of UK beekeepers. Close on one in three hives failed to make it through this winter and spring \u2013 that's about 80,000 colonies \u2013 leaving us with a potential crisis on our hands. Fewer honeybees will, as you'd expect, mean less honey. But as British honey only accounts for around 10% of the honey we consume in the UK, we should still be able to spread the sweet stuff on our toast well after the indigenous varieties run out, albeit at a higher price, as droughts in Argentina and the conversion of land for biofuel production reduce global supply.</p> <p>More worryingly, insects pollinate a third of everything we humans eat \u2013 most fruits and vegetables, nuts, seeds, and forage for our livestock. As we become more and more dependent on a monoculture system of growing food, we become more reliant on the honeybee to do the bulk of this work; trucked into an area for just a few days or weeks when a single crop is blossoming, they can be moved in their hives to more fertile pastures when the orchards and fields turn into a barren wasteland. Not so the <a href=\"http://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/projects/bombus/decline.html\">bumblebees</a>, solitary bees, moths and butterflies who have suffered a sharp decline as a result of modern farming practices.</p> <p>US farmers have already warned Congress that they are being forced to reduce their acreage of crops because of a shortage of honeybees for pollination and the subsequent rising cost of renting hives. <a href=\"http://www.ars.usda.gov/News/docs.htm?docid=15572\">Colony collapse disorder</a> (CCD), the term used to describe the mysterious wipeout of more than a third of US honeybees \u2013 a million this year, 800,000 the year before \u2013 has not yet been confirmed in Britain. </p> <p>Wet weather, the <a href=\"http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7304562435786960616\">varroa mite</a> and inappropriate controls to reduce the parasite are being blamed for our bee decline.</p> <p>Whatever the causes, how long before the yields from British apple orchards are affected?</p> <p>We could just import more food, but with honeybees dying on a similar scale around the world, our global food production is far from secure. Better to find the culprit. But that entails spending more money on research, something the UK government seems loath to do as made clear by its response to a <a href=\"http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page16488\">petition backing</a> the British Beekeepers' Association (BBKA) call for \u00a38m over five years to \"fund scientific research into maintaining UK bee stocks\".</p> <p>But measures could be put in put in place now that don't cost anything, most importantly tighter pesticide controls. EU agriculture ministers have backed proposals for more stringent safety tests on pesticides including extra safeguards to ensure chemicals are not toxic to bees. Britain was one of the few countries that abstained from agreeing to this plan despite current tests being woefully inadequate for protecting honeybee colonies. Researchers have found that widely used pesticides can interfere with honeybees' sophisticated communication systems and impair memory. They have not been ruled out as one of the factors contributing to CCD in the US. British farmers warn that tighter controls could destroy their crop production \u2013 a view not shared by their European counterparts. Although the National Farmer's Union supports the BBKA's campaign for more government funding of bee research, it would do better to throw its weight behind stricter pesticide testing. The very chemicals it wants to save could be the ones aiding the destruction of honeybees which we need as much as the sun and rain to make their crops \u2013 and our food \u2013 grow.</p>",

  "<p>The past few days have posed an almost insurmountable challenge for the international community. Russia finally agreed a <a href=\"http://www.cfr.org/about/newsletters/editorial_detail.html?id=1075\">ceasefire</a> \u2013 not because international diplomacy succeeded but because Russia had achieved its goals. Now the work of piecing together a sustainable peace begins, but on a very shaky foundation.</p> <p>This is not just the story of an enraged Russia settling scores with the west in a 21st-century version of \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Game\">great game</a>\" politics. It is the story of complex political disputes in Georgia that have lain unresolved for years. </p> <p>The tragedy is that this is a war that did not have to happen. Georgia has fallen into a trap laid by a hostile, resurgent Russia. Yet this is partly a trap of its own making. For years the Georgian government has failed to engage seriously with the needs and interests of its secessionist regions. Nor has it pursued a consistent strategy to attract these regions to Tbilisi (and away from reliance on Russia), and to persuade them that they could thrive in a united Georgia. It has instead tried to coerce them back into the fold through pressure, isolation and threats.</p> <p>Russia, an aggressive and unforgiving neighbour, has stepped into the void. It has taken advantage of the alienation felt by South Ossetia and Abkhazia to further its interests and to send a powerful message to the west and to recalcitrant neighbours that it is a force to be reckoned with.</p> <p>Georgia's frustration with existing negotiations and peacekeeping formats had been building exponentially. President Saakashvili, who has staked his political career on restoring Georgia's territorial integrity, was keen to shake up political processes that were not delivering. Talk in Tbilisi was of \"unfreezing the frozen conflicts\". Russia, incensed by what it saw as western \"double standards\" over <a href=\"http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,3071363,00.html\">Kosovo</a>, and threatened by talk of Georgian and Ukrainian membership of Nato, also saw fit to escalate the situation, flexing its muscles and provoking Georgia.</p> <p>Saakashvili has always felt that the west should play a greater role in shoring up Georgia's security, and in resolving its conflicts. Latterly, the strategy has been one of \"the worse it gets, the better it gets\" \u2013 the assumption being that if it can be demonstrated to western diplomats that Russia is really a threat to Georgia, then the west will come to Georgia's rescue. But brinkmanship is a risky game, and it appears to have backfired on Saakashvili badly. There are serious questions over whether his leadership can survive this latest blow. </p> <p>The west must also bear a degree of responsibility. Consistently turning a blind eye to the shortcomings of Georgia's fledgling democracy and offering largely uncritical support has done the country no favours. US encouragement of Georgia's bid for Nato membership provoked Russian ire and raised Georgian expectations not only of political but even military backing.</p> <p>The lesson of this past week is surely that we ignore so-called dormant conflicts at our peril. This goes to the core of the problem, though \u2013 that there is a crisis in international systems for managing conflict, and building peace. The UN is paralysed by the veto powers of its permanent members and the world community does not know how to approach the issue of self-determination.</p> <p>At the root of this conflict lies the political visions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia \u2013 very different from one another in some respects \u2013 visions that do not fit easily into the current world order, where states prevail. The onus is on the international community to find a consistent and creative response to what <a href=\"http://www.hoover.org/publications/digest/22786004.html\">Timothy Garton Ash</a> terms the nationalist's question: \"Why should I be a minority in your country when you could be a minority in mine?\"</p> <p>Territorial integrity is not the only international law that has been violated in the past week. There is a need for governments and international organisations to give more prominence to international humanitarian norms and standards and human rights law, and publicly to acknowledge what appears to be the disproportionate use of force by both Russia and Georgia in pursuit of their objectives. </p> <p>It is crucial to the medium and long-term prospects for peace that a high-level investigation takes place into allegations of indiscriminate and targeted killings and human rights violations by all sides. </p> <p>There are many challenges ahead. There is no clear mediator who can be perceived as neutral now that Russia has proved itself to be a party to the conflict, and the west is seen as a friend of Georgia. Peacekeeping formats that are acceptable to Georgia, Russia, South Ossetia and Abkhazia will also be hard to find.</p> <p>Years of painstaking work to rebuild trust, to increase mutual understanding and to begin the long, patient process of reconciling communities have been wiped out by these few days' madness. Now it must start again.</p>",
  "<p><br>The natural urban landscape is making way for sterile corporate developments. Photograph: Graeme Robertson</p> <p>When it comes to the cities of the world the general attitude seems to be: get out! The moment you have enough money, or your work allows, or you begin to think sentimentally about views and birdsong, leave! If cities were people, they'd be the last one to be picked for the football team. If they were food, they'd be Spam.</p> <p>Prince Charles spoke for many when he described cities as \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/13/gmcrops.food\">unsustainable unmanageable, degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness</a>\", (OK, maybe not exactly how most people would phrase it but the sentiment is the same). </p> <p>Cities are fair game for a kicking. If the authorities want to tear them down and rebuild them, they are doing us all a favour and it can only be an improvement; that is the general sentiment, shared by right-wing gated-community dwellers and deep-green environmentalists across the board.</p> <p>But from where I stand they're all wrong, and every time I come across about a swath of city being destroyed to make way for the modern world, I mourn. </p> <p>One of the most haunting things I've read recently is the description in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Getting-Rich-First-Changing-China/dp/0701178973\">Duncan Hewitt's \"Getting Rich First\"</a>, a book about modern China, of the city centres being razed overnight during the past 15 years. Beijing, for centuries, had been made up of '<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2008/jun/05/greenbuilding.ethicalliving?picture=334608097\">hutongs</a>' or lanes, meandering between old courtyard houses, but modernisation began in the early 1990s, and destruction was both tremendous and indiscriminate (in China you do not need to argue with English Heritage for two years if you want to knock down a neighbourhood). </p> <p>Hewitt would periodically leave China and return to find Beijing more and more unrecognisable. He writes that \"a joke went the rounds that Beijing was the only place in the world where you had to phone a restaurant before going out for dinner, not to reserve a table but to check that the building hadn't been demolished. This struck me as a little exaggerated until one evening, when, after driving up and down the same street several times in an increasingly desperate search for a favourite restaurant, we realised that it had indeed been swallowed up by a large building site. We retreated to a large and evidently very popular restaurant on the other side of the road... the food was very good and a few weeks later my friend decided to go there again; when he arrived he found only a corrugated-iron fence, a large hole in the ground, and signs announcing the city's next construction project.\" </p> <p>And here in London we are equally cavalier about our past: I went to Spitalfields market recently, which was, until a few years ago, a market full of raucous vitality, drawing people and mess and life from all over London. Then the City stepped in, and bought it up. They built over most of it leaving a small shell of the old building at one end where - when I went there - there are still a few market stalls. But (I may just have gone on a bad day of course), the stalls feel as if they're more for show than part of a real market: the bustle and chaos of a proper market is eviscerated beneath the glass and steel of the imposing <a href=\"http://www.fosterandpartners.com/Projects/1146/Default.aspx\">Norman Foster building</a> that has taken over. </p> <p>And now tower blocks are planned for neighbouring Shoreditch: it's the repetition of a pattern which goes back centuries and which perfectly reflects the pattern of behaviour which has got us into so much trouble on the environmental front.</p> <p>This is what we do. We group together, we humans, like certain insect species - ants and bees come to mind - and we build complex hives or nests in which we can live together. Jane Jacob's amazing book <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Jacobs\">The Death and Life of Great American Cities</a>, published in 1961, perfectly anatomises the wondrous and fragile balance of a successful city neighbourhood, with life on the streets, people keeping an eye out for each other, people talking, living side by side and helping with raising children or looking after aged parents. (This balance can obviously exist in a town or a village too: what I am interested in right here is the fact that this can also exist in cities). </p> <p>When a city works well, it can be the best way imaginable to live: you can have a breath of greenery, but also be able to walk to your friend's house, you can stroll with a buggy through energetic streets instead of having to get into a car, you can feel part of humanity instead of cut off from it. </p> <p>So what do we do to these beautiful hives and ants' nests that we have so carefully constructed and maintained for centuries and sometimes millennia? We don't allow people the materials to continue building their nests in the way they wish to build them. Instead we stamp on them. We pull the wings off. We build the <a href=\"http://www.stadiumguide.com/beijing.htm\">Bird's Nest</a>(so ironic to call a huge monolith of steel after the frail brilliance of a bird's home) or Norman Foster's Allen &amp; Overy HQ. </p> <p>We build something new where the old was working perfectly well. I would argue that what is being destroyed here is not something of abstract historical value, but something living, something of the best ways we interact with each other. </p> <p>In Jacobs book (an attack on town-planning habits) she points out that cities need to be thought of as systems of \"organised complexity\". Handled with care and sensitivity, cities could be bright bright green, sustainable, joyful places to live. What, though, are the chances? Should we all forget it, run for the hills, and leave the cities to the people who can't afford an exit route?</p>",

Photograph: Dan Chung<br></p> <p>Are you allowed to watch the Olympics at work? Some 3.3 million people watched Tom Daley and Blake Aldridge fail to fly in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/aug/12/tvratings.television\">synchronised diving</a> on Monday. The event took place while most of the UK was having its breakfast, outside normal office hours. But what about those that are squarely positioned when working Britons should be, well, working? </p> <p>It's alright for some. In our office, for example, there are flat-screen televisions suspended from the ceilings at strategic points, with the sound down, so that we can keep up with the latest news - or the judo - whether we like it or not.</p> <p>But in plenty of offices a television is not a vital source of information, it's simply a distraction. In previous years when important football games have taken place during the day, bosses have often been persuaded to allow a TV to be brought in or workers to sneak out to somewhere with a big screen. But this time we're talking about hours of sport, day after day, so talking your employer round is unlikely to be quite so easy.</p> <p>If sporting spectators are frowned on in your office, do you secretly follow the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2008/aug/12/olympics2008.olympicsaquatics \">team's progress online</a> when no one is looking, and quietly splutter into your tea when something exciting happens?

  "<p><br>Rosie Boycott. Photograph: Eamonn McCabe</p> <p>Continuing the year of being told what to eat, London has just got itself a new food champion in the form of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/05/boris.london\">ex-newspaper editor Rosie Boycott</a>. Just weeks after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/jul/19/greenpolitics.discriminationatwork\">writing to Boris Johnson to offer her services</a> as a food maven, she's been appointed <a href=\"http://www.londonfoodstrategy.org.uk/\">chair of London Food</a> with responsibility for improving Londoners' access to healthy, locally produced and affordable food. </p> <p>There's probably little to argue with there - good food for all is pretty laudable - but with an increasing number of edicts and campaigns it increasingly feels like being stuck in an endless Home Economics lesson. Hugh says buy free-range chicken, Gordon implores us to give British veal a go and Jamie never wants to see another turkey twizzled. Is anyone else finding it all a little tiresome?</p> <p>Boris and Rosie should realise that being a food hero is a complicated business and not everyone is successful. Gordon Brown couldn't hope to have the same impact as Gordon Ramsay when he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jul/07/food.waste1\">scolded us for wasting food</a>. Nigella can cause a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2006/dec/12/media.food\">run on goose fat</a> with a single mention but no amount of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/feb/23/books.news\">pleading from Delia can make us touch tinned meat</a>.</p> <p>Grand projects help, like making school dinners healthy or encouraging us to go free-range, but how do they fare after the hype abates? With the first of these big campaigns, <a href=\"http://www.jamieoliver.com/schooldinners\">Jamie's School Dinners</a>, it's been a mixed bag. The law has now been changed as to what schools can serve but the kids have rejected this healthy improvement, with <a href=\"http://www.mailonsunday.co.uk/news/article-1033836/Number-pupils-having-school-dinners-plunges-Jamie-Olivers-healthy-meals-campaign.html\">the number of children taking school meals shrinking</a>. </p> <p>The free-range campaign began at the start of the year with a <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/food/on-tv/river-cottage/hughs-chicken-run/\">special season on Channel 4</a> and is still going strong. Sainsbury's have just announced that during 2008 so far there's been a <a href=\"http://www.fwi.co.uk/Articles/2008/08/07/111546/sainsburys-launches-new-range-of-higher-welfare-chicken.html\">60% increase in the sale of free-range</a> (or, as they prefer to say, \"higher welfare\") chicken. To the delight of Jamie and Hugh they have even launched a new range to accommodate demand, and a YouGov poll says 38% of shoppers now look for such ethical foods. </p> <p>With these successes, you can see why a well-known figure advising us on food seems like a good idea to Boris. But the problem with Rosie Boycott is that what makes her eligible for the position is also what undermines her in this context; Boycott is now living the good life in Somerset, running a small farm where she raises pigs and grows her own vegetables. How this puts her in tune with the needs of city-dwellers isn't immediately clear. <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-450039/My-life-smallholder-Rosie-Boycott.html\">Consider the following dispatch</a>:</p> <blockquote> Standing in the Victorian potting shed in our walled garden, I shake a tiny coriander seed out of its packet and drop it into the soil in a pot. I then do the same with marjoram, green basil, purple basil, flat-leaf parsley, curly parsley, chervil, oregano and peppermint. </blockquote> <p>Now, if do live in an urban environment, try and apply that to your own life. Would you follow this woman's advice? And does she have what it takes to make a real, lasting change in the way we eat?</p>",
  "<p>In 2007, 12 million farmers grew GM crops over an area of 114m hectares (281m acres) in 23 different countries. From the prairie farmers who grow GM crops across 10,000 hectares to the farmers who use this technology on less than one hectare, GM is a global reality and is used on average on areas of just less than 10 hectares.</p> <p>Not quite the technology that only helps big corporations and big farmers, as suggested by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/13/prince.charles.gm.farming?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=media\">Prince Charles</a>, then. In reality, of those farmers growing GM crops, 11 million are resource-poor farmers living and working in developing countries such as South Africa, India and China. Contrary to the allegations made, many of the seeds are supplied through their own countries' institutes, and are designed to help solve problems that farmers have in growing crops for food, feed, fibres and fuel. </p> <p>Food security is back on the international agenda \u2013 after the surpluses of food experienced in the 1970s and 1980s, the demand for food is again starting to exceed supply. For us in the affluent west, food security issues mean food inflation, but for the developing countries it means food availability. The cure is productivity \u2013 producing more food (on the same or less land) to increase supply and meet that demand. Increases in crop yields have long been the advantage of GM, and this is now a crucial consumer benefit with international importance. </p> <p>What is absolutely clear, however, is that GM is not the only solution \u2013 there is no magic bullet, no quick fix. But it can help by improving productivity, improving food quality, and reducing the environmental footprint of agriculture. A recent peer-reviewed report on the subject by <a href=\"http://www.pgeconomics.co.uk/\">PG Economics</a> demonstrated that production of soybeans, corn, and cotton in areas planted with GM crops were respectively 20%, 7%, and 15% higher than would have been the case had this technology not been used by farmers. Furthermore, less fuel use and additional soil carbon storage from reduced ploughing, facilitated by the use of GM crops, was equivalent to removing over 6 million cars from the road for one year. Not quite the environmental disaster some claim.</p> <p>So who benefits from the use of new technology in farming? Are \"giant corporations\" really the sole beneficiaries of this technology? A recent <a href=\"http://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/eurcho/v6y2007i3p46-53.html\">Belgian study</a> suggests that \" \u2026 on average, two-thirds of the global benefits are shared 'downstream', ie, among domestic and foreign farmers and consumers, while only one-third is extracted 'upstream', ie, by biotechnology developers and seed suppliers.\" Likewise, Terri Raney, from the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the UN, recently pointed out, \" ... the benefits are shared by consumers, technology suppliers and adopting farmers, although non-adopting farmers are penalised as their competitors achieve efficiency gains they are denied.\" </p> <p>Being able to achieve this around the world is one thing; for UK farmers, access to this technology requires a seismic change in the processing of GM applications stuck in a dysfunctional European regulatory system, and an ability to carry out field trials without fear of vandalism. </p> <p>Europe has always been a powerhouse of agricultural production \u2013 with climate change, the onus on the UK and Europe to increase agricultural productivity has never been greater. That's why we need to ensure that any further discussions about GM are scientific and based on solid facts.</p>",
  "<p>The eurozone is halfway towards <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jul/28/economics.globaleconomy\">its first recession</a> after data released today showed that its economy shrank in the last quarter, with Germany and France leading the way down.</p> <p>The European Union Statistics Office said that the economy of the 15 countries that share the euro contracted by 0.2% in the three months to June. This is the first time that the eurozone economy has shrunk since monetary union was established a decade ago. A second successive quarterly drop in growth will officially put the eurozone into recession, putting more pressure on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/14/inflation.bankofenglandgovernor\">the already struggling UK economy</a>.</p> <p>The fall was driven by Europe's two largest economies, Germany and France, who also reported falls in growth in the second quarter of this year.</p> <p>The German economy, which is the biggest in Europe, contracted by 0.5% in the second quarter from a 1.3% rise in the first quarter, official data showed. While the fall was smaller-than-expected, it was the first fall in almost four years, driven by a slump in the construction sector.</p> <p>The stronger euro and weakening global growth have damped demand for German exports while higher inflation has curbed domestic spending. </p> <p>Analysts said the poor figure was possibly a reaction to the strong growth in the first quarter, however, they noted that the credit crunch was starting to put the brakes on the economy.</p> <p>Meanwhile, France, Europe's second largest economy, experienced a much sharper drop in second quarter growth. In another blow, the expansion previously reported in the first three months of the year has also being trimmed.</p> <p>National statistics office INSEE said growth fell 0.3% in the three months to June while the 0.5% rise in the first quarter was scaled back to 0.4%. Subdued investment and foreign trade were the main drivers in the downturn.</p> <p>Christine Lagarde, the French economy minister, said the fall was mainly the result of global factors such as the financial market crisis, the price of oil and the strong euro and she rejected talk of a possible recession.</p> <p>\"The fundamentals of the French economy are healthy,\" she said, adding that the economy should begin to improve towards the end of the year and start of 2009. \"There is no question of a recession.\"</p> <p>However, economists were less optimistic over France's outlook saying it was unlikely that the country will avoid a second successive quarter of negative growth.</p> <p>\"The figures are disastrous. The economy is being hit on all fronts: consumption, which had been the main contributor to growth for some time, is being hit by soaring inflation and tighter lending conditions,\" said Diego Iscaro, economist at Global Insight. \"The bad thing is that we do not see a significant change in this situation in the coming months: indeed, most of the negative factors affecting the economy will remain in place for the rest of 2008. Against this backdrop, the recession in France, defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth, is an increasingly likely scenario.\"</p> <p>The figures come alongside growth data from other eurozone countries. The Dutch economy posted flat growth in the second quarter, the lowest in three years, while Spanish growth slowed to 0.1% - the weakest in the 15 years.</p> <p>Earlier figures showed that Italy, the third-largest eurozone economy, also suffered a drop in GDP of 0.3% in the second quarter of 2008.</p> <p>European Central Bank president Jean-Claude Trichet said last week that economic growth will be \"particularly weak\" through the third quarter, prompting investors to raise their bets that the bank will start cutting interest rates next year.</p> <p>Last month, the ECB increased borrowing costs to 4.25% - a seven-year high - to curb inflation. Figures today showed that European inflation remained unchanged at 4% in June.<br></p>",

Western Europe depends on Russia for 30% of its gas supplies.</p> <blockquote> <p>Georgia has built an oil and soon a gas pipeline which will carry oil and gas from Central Asia - this will end Russia's monopoly control over access to energy in Central Asia. This in itself makes Georgia a target for Russia. Russia, as the controller and protector of both Gazprom and Transneft could not tolerate this challenge.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>11.20am</strong></p> <p>The consensus among the commentariat is that Russia, particularly Vladimir Putin, has emerged as the clear victor in this short war in the Caucasus.

Speaking on <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/video/default.stm\">BBC Newsnight </a>- the video has yet to go up - Hunter dismissed talk of Russia as a resurgent power. It's Saudi Arabia with trees, he said, or words to that effect. He went to argue that in the long run, Russia will suffer as western companies will not be too keen to invest in such a volatile country. While Hunter's view is a useful corrective to the alarmist talk about Russia - and let's face it, it's still pretty enfeebled compared to the US - authoritarian countries do not seem to have much trouble attracting foreign investment. Just look at Russia's neighbour - China. </p> <p><strong>11.30am</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nzherald.co.nz/category/story.cfm?c_id=359&amp;objectid=10526482&amp;pnum=2\">Gwynne Dyer is not getting too worked up about this short war in the Caucasus</a>. He thinks it's much ado about nothing as he makes clear in the New Zealand Herald.</p> <blockquote> <p>There is no great moral issue here. What Georgia tried to do to South Ossetia is precisely what Russia did to Chechnya, but Georgia wasn't strong enough and South Ossetia had a bigger friend. There is no great strategic issue either: apart from a few pipeline routes, the whole Transcaucasus is of little importance to the rest of the world.

As she argues on the Guardian's Comment is Free, the problem is bigger than just Russia versus Georgia, it's how the world deals with that old question of self-determination.</p> <blockquote> <p>The lesson of this past week is surely that we ignore so-called dormant conflicts at our peril. This goes to the core of the problem, though - that there is a crisis in international systems for managing conflict, and building peace. The UN is paralysed by the veto powers of its permanent members and the world community does not know how to approach the issue of self-determination.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>2.45pm</strong></p> <p>Lativa, Estonia and Lithuania have been among the most ardent supporters of Georgia. <a href=\"http://www.baltictimes.com/news/articles/21104/\">The three Baltic states are nervous that they may be next</a>, not necessarily now, but 10 years from now, according to the Baltic Times website.</p> <p><strong>3.10pm</strong></p> <p>Anatol Lieven, a highly astute commentator on world affairs, has very little sympathy for Georgia and the Bush administration. <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/95713d6c-6966-11dd-91bd-0000779fd18c.html\">He makes the point in a piece for the Financial Times</a> that the US financed and trained the Georgian military even after the Georgian government had said that these forces were intended for the recovery of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The west should demonstrate to Moscow its real will and ability to defend those east European countries that have already been admitted into Nato, and to which it is therefore legally and morally committed - especially the Baltic states. We should say this and mean it. Under no circumstances should we extend such guarantees to more countries that we do not intend to defend. To do so would be irresponsible, unethical and above all contemptible.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>3.15pm</strong></p> <p>Our thanks yet again to <a href=\"http://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/08/13/georgia-russia-whats-next/\">Veronica Khokhlova at Global Voices</a> who provides a translation of <a href=\"http://www.cjes.ru/\">Oleg Panfilov's blog</a> from Tbilisi.</p> <blockquote> <p>If we analyse what's happened, we'll find many arguments both in favor of Georgia, and in favor of the imperial ways of today's Kremlin. One thing is clear, though - Georgia is not going to turn into a different country, it has tasted freedom in the past five years, has tasted democracy, despite the fact that many people do not like it. Now it's up to other remnants of the Soviet empire whether they are going to continue living the way they did or will learn from Georgia.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>3.40pm</strong></p> <p>The sniping between the Americans and the Russians continues, sometimes taking on a tone of squabbling children in the playground. This complaint is from one Colonel-General Anatoly Nogovitsyn, deputy head of Russia's general staff, at his daily briefing.</p> <p>\"We have information that American military-transport aviation say they are delivering a certain humanitarian cargo to Tbilisi airport, though they said we had bombed the airport two days ago. Let's ask them will they invite you (the media) to check whether it is humanitarian or not?... What is in it (the cargo) in reality? ... It is of major concern to Russians.\" </p> <p><strong>4pm</strong></p> <p>The Russia Today website reports that <a href=\"http://www.russiatoday.com/news/news/28945\">Russia has held a day of mourning</a> for those killed during the five days of fighting in South Ossetia.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"People from the capital Tskhinvali, which became a battlefield after being attacked by Georgia, are recovering from a nightmare.

  "<p>There are certain things that cannot be left to chance \u2013 or to the whims of politicians. Forging a durable and sustainable peace Between Israel and Syria is one of those issues. <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article4449488.ece\">Peace talks</a> with Syria, this time mediated by Turkey, are at the most promising point they've been for the past eight years.</p> <p>Sceptics fear that the political scandal embroiling the current Israeli government and Ehud Olmert's decision to step down as prime minister will set back, or even derail, the current efforts.</p> <p>But that need not be so. The current political chaos hands the Israeli electorate a golden chance to shape the country's destiny. The electorate needs to send a clear message to the candidates at the forthcoming elections that a peace deal with Syria and the necessary compromises this involves is a number one priority. Israelis need to vote against the ultra-hardline, unilateral policies of their government since Ariel Sharon took over in 2000 because they have not brought the security Israelis yearn for and have only ignited even more fear, hatred and distrust. </p> <p>Despite the desire of millions of Israeli citizens to enjoy good neighbourly relations in the region, the country today resembles a massive fortress, as Israel gropes for the false security of higher and higher walls. But even a barrier that reaches to the stratosphere and the \"iron wall\" of a mighty army can never be a substitute for true peace.</p> <p>As Israel celebrates six decades of existence, it has a lot to feel proud about. The country has built up a dynamic and robust democracy and competitive economy, and has a vibrant and diverse culture. But its continued oppression of the Palestinian people and failure to reach a rapprochement with Syria and Lebanon undermine these achievements. Israel, whose people pride themselves on their sense of justice, could edge closer to a fairer reality by mending fences with Syria. </p> <p>With the Palestinian track deadlocked, focusing on the relatively straightforward Syrian front makes sense, and a deal with Syria can, in turn, spark a virtuous circle that can help resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. As even Henry Kissinger, a good friend of Israel, put it: \"No war is possible without Egypt and no peace is possible without Syria.\"</p> <p>And now is the right moment to take the peaceful road to Damascus. With the Arab world at the readiest it has ever been to reach a compromise, Israel has a historic opportunity to integrate itself gradually into the region but, ironically, it has reacted to the Arabs' more accommodating stance by becoming more confrontational and aggressive. </p> <p>It would be pure folly to squander these opportunities, which are few and far between in this bitter conflict. Although Syria has a reputation in Israel as the most unbending and uncompromising of its adversaries, the conflict on that front could have been resolved half a century ago.</p> <p>Between 1951 and 1953, Adib Shishakli, then leader of Syria, which was smarting from the 1948 defeat, strove to strike a peace deal with Israel in order to focus his energy on internal reform and the country's development. </p> <p>Despite the opposition of leading Israeli military figures \u2013 who in Moshe Dayan's own words were following a strategy of expanding Israel's borders by \"snatching bits of territory\" \u2013 the high-level secret talks reached a promising conclusion in May 1953, but faced too much opposition in the Israeli cabinet.</p> <p>What if Israel and Syria, the country with the greatest ideological opposition to Zionism, had struck a peace deal back in 1953? Could war have been averted in 1967 and 1973? Could a viable Palestinian state have emerged alongside Israel and a compromise over the refugee problem reached? Could Israel have become a full citizen of the Middle East by now? Could the Arab countries have retained their Jewish populations? We will never know.</p> <p>In 1953, one of the main saboteurs of the embryonic peace deal was an obscure water expert by the name of Simha Blass. And the vexed issue of water has been a swirling undercurrent of the Arab-Israeli conflict that has repeatedly smashed the prospects of peace against the rocks.</p> <p>One of the main reasons behind the collapse of the Israeli-Syrian peace talks in 2000 was access to the Sea of Galilee, the inland lake where the river Jordan fetches up and which supplies the bulk of Israel's water. <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0522/p04s04-wome.html\">According</a> to Syria's foreign minister Walid Mualem, Israeli negotiators have agreed to return the Golan Heights down to the eastern coast of the lake, which, if true, removes a major stumbling block.</p> <p>In addition, pragmatism on the part of Israel \u2013 which receives the vast majority of the river Jordan's water resources while Syria and Lebanon only receive 5% of their needs from it \u2013 could ensure that water no longer becomes a cause of volatility. A more equitable division of the area's water resources, which need to be seen as a commonwealth between Israel, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria, could pay huge dividends.</p> <p>Rather than facing water shortages, this could actually prove to be a boon for Israel which is a global leader in <a href=\"http://cordis.europa.eu/israel/rd_expertise_5_en.html\">desalination technology</a> and home to the <a hef=\"http://www.water-technology.net/projects/israel/\">world's largest</a> desalination plant. </p> <p>If the European Union and the USA pledge, as part of a peace settlement, to help further develop and roll out this promising, and increasingly inexpensive, technology to all the countries in the region, water shortages could be averted and an underdeveloped economic sector bolstered.</p> <p>Over the coming months, opponents of peace with Syria will deploy all the tried and tested (not to mention, tired) arguments. They will point to Syria's close ties with Iran and its support of Hizbullah and Hamas as proof of the country's sinister intentions.</p> <p>But there is little reason to doubt the sincerity of the Syrian desire to bury the hatchet and enjoy the dividends of peace. The country is internationally isolated and wishes to come in from the cold. While it will never become a client state, nor should it be expected to, a peace agreement will undoubtedly bring covert, low-level hostilities to an end \u2013 especially if a settlement with the Palestinians follows soon after \u2013 and will empower the moderates to build further bridges towards normalisation.</p> <p>Not so long ago, the Levant was practically borderless and people crisscrossed it freely. Once upon a time, trains ran from Jaffa to Damascus and Beirut. Perhaps soon the political abyss will narrow enough for people to be able to do that again. </p> <p>In my next article for Cif I will argue that Syria should raise the peace ante and offer direct top-level talks with Israel's next prime minister.</p>",
  "<p>British households are wasting the annual output of a large power station by failing to switch off their flatscreen televisions, set-top boxes, and internet networks when they are not being used, according to Ofcom's latest Communications Market report.</p> <p>The equivalent output of the 1,500MW Didcot B power station in Oxfordshire could be saved each year if every home with a set-top box switched it off at night; that would conserve enough electricity to make 80bn cups of tea.</p> <p>Consumer electronics account for about a third of home energy use, according to the Energy Saving Trust, but that use is forecast to balloon to 45% by 2020 as more people buy more gadgets.</p> <p>The rise in average residential energy bills to just over \u00a31,000 a year has made people more energy aware, but only when it comes to buying obviously power-hungry devices such as fridges and freezers, according to Ofcom.</p> <p>Almost three quarters of Britons, when quizzed by the regulator, classed themselves as caring about the environment, and more than half said they had compared the green credentials of white goods before making a purchase. But only 39% of people think about the environmental impact of a new TV, DVD player or computer. </p> <p>When they get it home, meanwhile, most people leave their new kit switched on all the time, unnecessarily wasting electricity. </p> <p>Three quarters of people rarely switch off their set-top box, according to Ofcom, and that figure jumps to 83% for owners of a wireless home network. Plasma screens are particularly power hungry, according to the regulator, with the average set using three times the power of a normal TV when in use, and twice the power when left on standby. </p> <p>The average satellite set-top box gobbles up four and a half times the power of a flatscreen LCD television in the same state. Even a Freeview box uses twice the power of a flatscreen TV when left on standby.</p> <p>Almost half the country's mobile phone users, meanwhile, waste electricity by charging their handsets overnight, when in fact most models only need to be plugged in for about two hours. People aged between 16 to 24 are particularly guilty of this, with 80% doing it at least some of the time.</p>",
  "<p>The campaign to make tinned tuna dolphin-friendly was, in many ways, a success. It showed that the tuna industry could respond to environmental issues.</p> <p>But being dolphin-friendly is not the <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/environment/article4517778.ece\">end of the story</a>, because it's not the only sustainability issue when it comes to tinned tuna. Some tuna-fishing practices are responsible for wiping out thousands of sharks and turtles every year \u2013 including a number of rare and threatened species.</p> <p>Most tuna for tins is caught using \"fish aggregation devices\", or FADs, which are used to attract the fish. But they also attract a host of other species including turtles, sharks and juvenile tuna before everything around the FAD is scooped up in a huge net. On average, every time a FAD is used, 1kg of these other species will be caught for every 10kg of tuna. Research conducted in 2005 found that around 100,000 tonnes of so-called non-target species were caught worldwide. These and other problems with the tinned tuna trade are described in a Greenpeace briefing paper <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/oceans/john-west-worst-tinned-tuna-20080813\">Tinned Tuna's Hidden Catch</a>, released yesterday.</p> <p>The story of tuna is depressingly familiar. Globally, up to 90% of stocks of large predatory fish have been wiped out according to some scientists. We are literally emptying our oceans of marine life and as we do so, we fish further and further down the food chain. </p> <p>Years of bad management and over-fishing has left tuna itself in trouble. All 23 identified tuna stocks are heavily fished and nine are classified as critically endangered, endangered or vulnerable to extinction. Without effective management even the healthiest remaining stocks will risk collapse in the longer term. </p> <p>The UK is the second biggest consumer of tinned tuna in the world, after the US. What we do in this country can have a big impact on the tuna industry. And the industry big brands can effectively decide how the raw product is fished.</p> <p>In Greenpeace's <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/oceans/the-tuna-retailers-league-table-2008\">Tinned Tuna League Table</a> also released yesterday, the biggest brands \u2013 John West and Princes \u2013 who have about 60% of the market between them \u2013 have finished last and second last. They scored the worst against a list of sustainability criteria, including apparently indiscriminate use of FADs.</p> <p>More progressive retailers such as Sainsbury's and the Co-op are moving to sustainable catch methods and sourcing practices. Sainsbury's even tell you on the tin that their tuna is entirely caught with pole and line. It can be done.</p> <p>But better catch methods alone aren't enough. Marine reserves are also needed to give migratory and other marine species some refuge from fishing fleets. There is overwhelming scientific consensus of the need for large-scale marine reserves to let fish stocks recover from overfishing. Major seafood companies and retailers must act on this issue by supporting proposals for marine reserves and by refusing to accept any fish caught in proposed marine reserve areas.</p>",

I often walk close by hoping for the hum of activity. There have been many more flowers on site this year for them to take advantage of. Seems almost everyone has grown sweet peas that fill the summer evenings with fragrance as you pass. Many more plots are dotted with calendula, roses, assorted spots of colour. But it's our sunflowers I have really noticed.</p> <p>Think it is in the way the bees stick to them. No flying visits these. The bees that stop off on our sunflowers - and almost every flower has at least one or two - stay, seemingly for days. It's almost as though they are drunk on the heady pollen. Even after this week's monsoon rains. At least one pair were still there last night, maybe moved an inch or two in as many days. I thought at first they must have died. But no, an occasional movement of a leg, a readjustment of position signalled they were deeply involved.</p> <p>Does anyone know, are they stoned? Are they nodding off like an addict in a poppy field? Are they OK?

  "<p>Last month, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/08/wto.internationalaidanddevelopment\">Doha negotiations</a>, promising freer trade, broke down, ostensibly over a small technicality in safeguard rules. In reality, the talks collapsed because nobody \u2013 not Europe, not the United States, China, India, or the other main developing countries \u2013 was willing to take the political short-term hit by offending inefficient farmers and coddled domestic industries in order to create greater long-term benefits for virtually everyone. </p> <p>And they broke down because we really don't care. After a few exasperated editorials, the world has pretty much dropped the subject and gone back to its usual concerns. </p> <p>This is foolish. Establishing significantly freer trade would help the world combat almost all of its biggest problems. For an astonishingly low cost, we could improve education and health conditions, make the poorest people richer, and help everybody become better able to tackle the future. </p> <p>We have known for centuries that free trade almost always benefits both parties. The economist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo\">David Ricardo</a> pointed out in 1817 that both Great Britain and Portugal would benefit if they exploited their comparative advantages. Portugal could produce wine cheaply, whereas Great Britain could produce cloth much more cheaply than wine. By selling cloth and buying wine, Great Britain obtains more of both, as does Portugal. The same holds true today, when countries, doing what they do best produce more and exchange it for more of all other goods. </p> <p>Yet today, with international trade talks stalled and protectionist rhetoric rising, we are instead moving towards building bigger trade barriers. These barriers are supported by deep-pocketed, self-serving corporations and lobby groups, and defended by politicians who are scared that the redistribution of jobs, income, and wealth resulting from freer trade will reduce their chances of remaining in power. </p> <p>When the Doha trade round was launched shortly after September 11, 2001, there was plenty of international goodwill. But a recent Financial Times/Harris poll in the US, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Spain found people nearly three times more likely to say that globalisation is negative than positive. </p> <p>Recently, the <a href=\"http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Default.aspx?ID=788\">Copenhagen Consensus</a> project gathered some of the world's leading economists to decide how to do the most good for the planet in a world of finite resources. The panel \u2013 including five Nobel laureates \u2013 found that one of the single best actions the planet could take would be completing the Doha negotiations. They based their conclusions on new research for the Copenhagen Consensus project by Australian economist Kym Anderson. </p> <p>Anderson showed that if developing countries cut their tariffs by the same proportion as high-income countries, and services and investment were also liberalised, the annual global gains could climb to $120 billion, with $17 billion going to the world's poorest countries by 2015. </p> <p>This is a respectable sum, and certainly a benefit that the international community should try to achieve. But what we often fail to realise is that the story only starts here. As economies open up, as countries do what they do best, competition and innovation drive up rates of growth. </p> <p>More competition means that previously sheltered companies must shape up and become more productive, innovating simply to survive. Having more open economies allows more trade in innovation, so that new companies can almost instantly use smart ideas from around the globe. Instead of every closed market having to re-invent the wheel, once is enough to get everyone's economy going. </p> <p>This means that over time, the advantage of moving toward freer trade grows dramatically bigger: the $120 billion benefit in 2015 grows to many trillions of dollars of annual benefits by the end of the century. And the benefits would increasingly accrue to the developing world, which would achieve the biggest boosts to growth rates. </p> <p>We have seen three very visible cases of such growth boosts in three different decades. South Korea liberalised trade in 1965, Chile in 1974, and India in 1991; all saw annual growth rates increase by several percentage points thereafter. </p> <p>If we recast these benefits as annual instalments, a realistic Doha outcome could increase global income by more than $3 trillion every year throughout this century. And about $2.5 trillion annually would go to today's developing countries every year, or $500 a year on average for each individual in the third world, almost half of whom now survive on less than $2 a day. </p> <p>There would, of course, be costs. Freer trade would force some industries to downsize or close, although more industries would expand, and for some people and communities, the transition would be difficult. Yet the overall benefits of a successful Doha Round would probably be hundreds of times greater than these costs. </p> <p>It is interesting to contrast global skepticism about free trade with support for expensive, inefficient methods to combat global warming. Many argue that we should act, even if such action will have no benefit for the next decades, because it will help lessen the impact of global warming by the century's end. </p> <p>But free trade also promises few benefits now and huge benefits in the future. Moreover, if we could stop global warming (which we can't), the benefit for future generations would be one-tenth or less of the benefit of freer trade (which we certainly can achieve). Still, there are few celebrity campaigners calling on politicians to sort out the Doha Round. </p> <p>Global fear about free trade leaves the planet at risk of missing out on the extraordinary benefits that it offers. Free trade is good not only for big corporations, or for job growth. It is simply good. </p> <p><em>Copyright: <a href=\"www.project-syndicate.org\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2008.</em></p>",
  "<p>I don't know how I missed the concept of \"enviro-crime\" until this week when I became a petty enviro-criminal myself. Franz Kafka, you never dreamed that garden hedges could get people into trouble, did you?</p> <p>I think my ignorance stems from the fact that the Daily Mail bangs on so much about council snoopers and spy-chips in wheelie bins that my eyes glaze over. Whenever I try to check out these stories, they're not quite right. </p> <p>One rough and ready guide is whether or not the other papers, radio and TV, carry these often terrifying reports. This week, for example, most papers have been running the draft - daft? - Home Office proposal to allow councils, health authorities and other public bodies to require access to our internet traffic. </p> <p>Not the content, but the who and when. Apparently, it arises from an EU directive (so the data can be shared with Bulgaria) number 2006/24/EC which was first floated after the 7/7 London bombs of 2005. </p> <p>It required members states to change their domestic law to ensure data retention by assorted providers for 12 months. Not for the first time we all have to wish that Osama bin Laden's father had been nicer to him.</p> <p>Obviously there are serious issues here: we all want bombers to be traced and caught; phone and email records helped catch the 7/7 chumps. But given the problems of securely retaining data 2006/24/EC raises troubling questions which are being teased out in public debate. </p> <p>Perhaps the Home Office doesn't really mean it and is making a daft overbid persuade us to settle gratefully for less.</p> <p>Public attitudes depend to some degree on confidence in the public authorities. Whenever the Mail gives prominence to some over-zealous council official persecuting an old lady who puts her waste in the wrong bin or the police prosecute the victim, not the perpetrator, we all get a little more irritated. It may not happen a lot, but it does happen too much.</p> <p>In our neighbourhood we now have to sort our waste into six basic categories - I think I've got that right - ranging from old-fashioned black bag waste to garden waste (a pink carton) and plastic (white carton) via bottles, tins and newspapers - the largest category in our house, which I bag up. </p> <p>It's time-consuming and I wonder sometimes if it's worth everyone's trouble, time and money. But we have a real problem with waste disposal in this country and need to get better regardless of global warming scenarios. At least I still get a weekly collection and live in a semi. </p> <p>For people on what Whitehall calls AWC (work that one out for yourself), who are seriously old or infirm, and live in flats the new fortnightly regime must be very hard. </p> <p>Government advice, when I read it, sounds sensible enough. Guidance must be clear, voters must be consulted and public concerns addressed. Storage should be secure, advice (on wrapping up rotten fish) must be available. All grand, but there's no guarantee in any walk of life that a system will be dickhead-free.</p> <p>Which brings me back to my enviro-crime. On Monday we had a postcard through the door from the local \"enviro-crime prevention service\". Under section 154 of the Highways Act of 1980 (vegetation which overhangs the public highway) we were apparently caught in possession of an \"overgrown hedge please\". The note was signed (\"sorry for the red pen\") and gave us seven days to remove said \"obstruction and potential hazard to other highway users\" - or else. </p> <p>What else? It didn't actually say. But I've read Kafka and the Mail long enough to get straight out there with the shears, trembling with a mixture of civic guilt and indignation. It happens that we had visitors we needed to impress (potential in-laws?) last weekend, so we'd tidied up. 48 hours earlier I had trimmed the hedge to stop the creeper trailing on the ground and attracting litter, lager cans etc, dropped by serious enviro-criminals who infest the neighbourhood.</p> <p>We're talking deciduous leaves and some Virginia creeper poking about nine inches over a five foot brick and lattice-topped wall here. We live on a busy B road, a bus route too, the pavement is 10 feet wide. It gets plenty of traffic, as does the road where single decker buses have lately been replaced by double-deckers which block the car-lined street - they're wider. They are usually much less than full. Irritating.</p> <p>Never mind. I trimmed back the delinquent hedge to two inches over the wall, to show willing. Will that be enough? We'll find out, won't we? But it niggled. We all encounter hedges which are dangerously unwieldy or sport nasty prickles (mine has one, but I keep it in order), but the seriously recidivist hedge on the side road round our corner is - I just checked - as luxuriant as ever. </p> <p>Of course, August is not the best month in which to give people seven days notice, so it may be in hand soon. But the biggest vegetation-delinquent is, I think, the council itself. It's me who trims the weeping whatever-it-is on the pavement outside to stop it hitting people in the face. </p> <p>The adjoining sycamore is now taller than a three storey house and blocks whatever morning light gets past from the ash across the street - planted there after a car fire destroyed the pretty little may tree. Ash is one of the faster growing forest trees. It's tall and ugly, it shouldn't be there.</p> <p>Does it matter? Not much. It isn't cancer, we're not starving or being invaded by Mr Putin. But it niggles and when the council wants to have the right to vet our email traffic we think of enviro-crimes and wonder if hedges will soon be given asbos.</p> <p>I'm now taking a few days off.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Charter\">Olympic Charter</a>, much like the <a href=\"http://www.lords.org/laws-and-spirit/laws-of-cricket/preamble-to-the-laws,475,AR.html\">Spirit of Cricket</a>, is one of those documents that seeks to proscribe the philosophy of a sporting contest, but bears increasingly little resemblance to the reality of the event. That does not mean that the charter is worthless. The values it defines are still worthy of aspiring to.</p> <p>Article six reads: \"The Olympics are competitions between athletes in individual or team events, not between countries.\" Of all the sentiments enshrined in the charter, this is by far the most abused.</p> <p>Google \"Beijing Olympics\" and the medal table will appear at the top of your screen. I couldn't care less about the medal table, which is nothing more than a cross-index of a nation's population size and the amount of money and resources it lavishes on sport. The contest between China and the USA is diverting, if only because so many people are so keen to see it as some kind of proxy indication of global standing, but the supposed struggle between Australia and England is little more than headline filler.</p> <p>There are three groups whose interests are served by the constant referrals to the table: whichever nations are sitting first and second; the media, who have a handy league format upon which to build their stories; and the sports administrators, who must justify their expenditure through setting and meeting the arbitrary targets the medal table provides. So Britain want to finish third in 2012. Will anyone care if, instead, they end up fifth?</p> <p>In part, the top nations' obsession with their position in the table can be justified as a means of processing the sheer number of medals they win. But the necessary emphasis on quantity seems to rob the Games of much of what makes them so enjoyable. Britain, like most other countries, has never had to deal with the prospect of winning 20 or more golds, and so it has the luxury of making individual heroes of the winners it does have. Jonathan Edwards became a national icon for winning our sole gold at Atlanta in 1996, and the public became familiar with, and revelled in, his character and story.</p> <p>Better still, what of Togo's first Olympic medal, a bronze in the K1 slalom yesterday? That single podium placement will mean as much to the Togolese as a dozen gold medals to other nations. The man who won it, Benjamin Boukpeti, will be a hero to his people. A bronze medallist from the USA will struggle to get on the evening news round-ups and may simply become another notch in the tally. That may be unavoidable, given the level of the USA's success and the space available to report it, but I still know which side of the equation I prefer.</p> <p>Equally inviolable in terms of the Olympic spirit is the notion that an athlete can win for themselves and choose not to do so for the glory of their nation. When John Carlos and Tommie Smith thrust their back-gloved fists into the night air at the Mexico Olympics in 1968, they were using their personal triumph to express their discontent with their home country. The impossibility of a Chinese athlete making a similar protest to that of Smith and Carlos is one of the few great flaws of these Games.</p> <p>Patriotism is undeniably part of the Olympics, and I'd never want it to be otherwise. But the nation for which the athlete is competing should never overwhelm the individual. There is a point at which sporting nationalism becomes odious, a point never better captured than by John Stockton when he was in Barcelona with the USA's basketball 'dream team'. Asked why the team were staying outside of the athlete's village, Stockton famously replied: \"The Olympic spirit is about beating people, not about living with them.\"</p> <p>The spirit, of course, is about both those things. The majority of United States athletes, indeed all athletes, tend to rebuff the media's invitations to indulge in international slanging matches. Australia's Rob Bell, who won bronze in the C1 slalom behind Britain's David Florence, knocked back a question about what this meant for the rivalry between the two countries by saying simply \"What rivalry?\" Five minutes later, vaguely repelled by the press pack's attempts to stir things up, he whispered to his two fellow medallists, \"Let's get the hell out of here\".</p> <p>Let's leave the medal table to China and the USA, to the sports administrators and target-setters, and to the press. The rest of us \u2013 spectators, fans and athletes \u2013 get along fine without it.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>Russell will be here from 1.45am...</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>1.56am:</strong> Good morning everyone, and welcome to day six. Five days gone and what have we learned? That a diving pool is a tough place to learn about office politics; that Australian wit is a loosely defined quality when applied by sport officials; and that swimming records now have the lifespan of a mayfly.</p> <p>We return to the pool this morning, when the men's 100m freestyle world record will no doubt be lowered again, having already been broken twice in the semi-finals yesterday. Medals are also up for grabs in the men's 200m breastroke, women's 200m butterfly, women's 200m butterfly, and women's 4x200m freestyle. At the fencing, the women attempt to make a point or two in the sabre quarters and semis, with the finals later this morning. In gymnastics there'll be medals all around in the men's all around. In judo British hopes are with <strong>Peter Cousins</strong> in the men's -100kg, which will move through the preliminaries and repechage to the finals later this morning. Plus we have the women's skeet shooting final, as well as boxing, softball, volleyball and beach volleyball. Let the daze begin ...</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>2.12am:</strong> Let's run our eye over some British interests for today. As well as <strong>Peter Cousins</strong> in the judo, veteran <strong>Mark Foster</strong> takes one almighty breath and dives into the 50m freestyle heats, while 400m gold medallist <strong>Rebecca Adlington</strong> returns to the Water Cube in the 800m freestyle heats. In badminton, <strong>Nathan Robertson</strong> and <strong>Gail Emms</strong> are in the mixed doubles quarter-finals.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>2.29am:</strong> Michael Phelps, who by now must surely have a full medal jacket in his wardrobe, isn't exactly prospecting for more gold today but the American is in action this morning in the 200m individual medley semi-finals.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>3.01am:</strong> Let's go poolside now, where the men are emerging for the 200m breaststroke final. Japan's Kosuke Kitajima is the defending champion here.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>3.09am:</strong> No change at the top there, then. No world record either, but Kitajima defends his title in a time of 2min 7.64sec, holding off Australia's Brenton Rickard, in second, and France's Hugues Dubosq in third. Kitajima add the 200m title to his Beijing 100m gold as he successfully defends the two titles he won in Athens.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>3.20am:</strong> Sensation in the women's 100m freestyle semi-finals, where China's Pang Jiaying is disqualified for starting too early. Great Britain's <strong>Fran Halsall</strong> qualifies fourth fastest for the final. Pang won her semi-final in 53.49sec but was disqualified for flinching at the start.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>3.27am:</strong> Britain's <strong>Gregor Tait</strong> now lines up in lane 3 for his 200m backstroke semi-final.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>3.30am:</strong> Tait finishes fourth in his semi, and qualifies sixth fastest for the final in 1.56.72.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>3.33am:</strong> But where's the green and gold? Paul from Canberra reckons any suggestion that Australian swimming is in decline is rubbish: \"Yes, we're happy to acknowledge GB's improved showing in the pool, just as we're happy to acknowledge the wonderful performances of the Chinese, Koreans and Japanese swimmers and divers who all sit above or equal to the GB swimming team in the medal tally.\" Well, wattle you think of that?</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>3.51am:</strong> Still, Australia's hopes in the women's 200m butterfly decline as Jessicah Shipper is caught by Liu Zige and Jiao Liuyang in a Chinese one-two in the women's 200m butterfly. Liu takes gold and breaks the world record in 2min 4.08sec.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>3.51am: </strong>Is it possible to set a blistering pace in a pool? If ever it was going to happen it's now, in the men's 100m freestyle final.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>3.56am:</strong> No record, but what a finish. <strong>Alain Bernard</strong>'s fingertip wins gold for France in 47.21sec, ahead of Australia's <strong>Eamon Sullivan</strong> - who still holds the world record in 47.05 - and the US's Jason Lezak. Bernard, whose shoulders must have their own postcode, then waves to the crowd who are all hooping and hollering like baseball sluggers at a Madonna concert.</p> <p>Read our <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/14/olympics2008.olympicsaquatics3\">full report</a> on this morning's exciting races</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>4.15am:</strong> Ho-hum, Michael Phelps wins another race. The American strolls through his 200m individual medley semi-final to win in 1min 57.70sec. Britain's <strong>Liam Tancock</strong> finishes fourth in 1:59.42 and awaits the second semi to see if he makes the final. Phelps' US team-mate Ryan Lochte qualifies fastest in 1:57.69, bumping Medal Man back to second.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>4.21am:</strong> Tancock qualifies seventh fastest for the final, and is joined by fellow Brit <strong>James Goddard</strong>, who finishes third in his semi, and qualifies sixth fastest for the final, in 1:58.63.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>4.46am:</strong> Welcome back, Australia. The Antipodean women smash the world record in the 200m freestyle relay, slicing 5.78sec off the world record to win gold in 7:44.31. It's a third Beijing gold for Stephanie Rice. Silver to China, bronze to the US, with all three teams finishing under the old world mark. The wonders of deep, deep water and a bit of techno kit.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>4.49am:</strong> Meanwhile, things are looking promising gymnastics-wise for Britain's <strong>Daniel Keatings</strong>, currently third in the men's all around final.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>4.50am:</strong> A few results to keep you up to date: in the fencing women's team sabre, Poland beat Canada 45-44 and Russia beat South Africa 45-13. The Netherlands beat China 1-0 to go top of Group A in the women's hockey, while Spain account for Germany 72-59 to move to top of Group B in the men's basketball.<br>Visit our <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/olympics/2008/events/aug/14 \">results and schedule</a> page.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>5.05am:</strong> In another corner of the Water Cube, the Croatia water polo team have morphed into a bunch of David Wilkie lookalikes. Seems the Croatians have grown the moustaches for the Olympics for good luck. \"Maybe it's working but it's too early to tell,\" said Igor Hinic after the team's win over Italy.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p>5.11am: Oooh, that's got to hurt. Japan's Hiroyuki Tomita comes apart at the rings and crashes to the mat in a heap. Ice on the neck, pain on the face. But why did the judges feel the need to watch the replay over and over and over again before awarding their marks, one wonders?</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>5.13am:</strong> Britain's <strong>Naomi Folkard</strong> is out of the women's archery after losing 106-97 to her Japanese opponent, Nami Hayakawa.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>5.23am: Mornin' all.</strong> Alan here. Russell's toddled off to scrape Olympic images from his retinas, and the cleaners have joined the team in the office. Stick with us for news on the ultra-stacked men's gymnasts; action from the beach volleyball (where, unlike <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/12/emptyseats\">elsewhere</a>, there are never any empty seats); and British updates as and when they filter into the Guardian bunker.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>5.29am:</strong> By my reckoning, we've had four golds so far today, and there are another 13 in the offing. In the pool they've been going record-crazy, but all eyes have turned to the National Indoor Stadium, where the men's individual all-round event is taking place. <strong>Team GB's Daniel Keatings is currently languishing pretty far down</strong> - but he's only completed three disciplines, while most others are on four.</p> <!-- Block 24 -->       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4m-_2fEp62s?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <object width=\"460\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/4m-_2fEp62s&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/4m-_2fEp62s&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"></embed></object> </figure>   <p><strong>5.35am:</strong> Brazil, as you might expect from a coast-heavy country, are beating the Greeks in the beach volleyball. Meanwhile, for those who might have doubts about the merits of watching blokes in, essentially, girls' smalls twirling and spinning for the judges' delight, feast your eyes on some of the above antics...</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>5.42am: Team GB</strong> Gah! Our 'one to watch' for today, Peter Cousins, has been dumped out in the judo. Keatings, meanwhile, is looking pretty good on the floor, as far I can tell (basically he hasn't fallen over yet).</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>5.46am: Team GB gymnastics</strong> Matt 'Here's one I made earlier' Baker is all over the 'nastics, and apparently Keatings has his speciality to come - the pommel, if I heard correctly. Which is a kind of horse.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>5.49am:</strong> It's the USA... no, only kidding, it's China... leading, with Yang Wei apparently some way clear at the top. I know you're waiting to hear of spectacular, high-speed, mid-air balls-ups, though, so don't fear, I've got 'em peeled.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>5.55am:</strong> Emails from John Senior, Mark Webster and Al Parkes, re: Brazil's coastline. Apparently Greece has much more of it. \"If coastlines really were an indicator of beach volleyball prowess then Greece (13,676km) should be comfortably ahead of Brazil (7,491km).\" says Mark. \"Canada (202,080km) would of course be heading for gold, though I guess ambient temperature might be an additional factor.\" I'm not going to argue, but I was thinking Copacabana, sun-tanned Brazilians, and all that entails... rather than the British package holiday-infested Greek sands. Fair dos?</p> <p>Anyway, Brazil won.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>6.01am:</strong> News on the lookey-likey thread from yesterday. I'm not sure how best to illustrate this for people, but my colleague Patrick Whyte has forwarded on a suggestion from Andrew Jolly in Australia: Michael Phelps and Quark the Ferengi from Star Trek. Have they ever been seen in a room together?</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>6.04am: Team GB gymnastics</strong> Keating is on the pommel horse, whirling madly...</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>6.05am:</strong> And the Beeb has gone to the news. Fandabydozy.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>6.08am:</strong> Keatings is in 17th after an \"excellent performance on the pommel horse\", according to Rishi Persad, but I can't relay his score. Probably wouldn't have meant much to you or I though, would it? Baker fancies the Russian, Khorokhordin. And I think he's pretty tasty too. But he's not going to win.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>6.14am: Coastline face-off:</strong> Austria (0km of coast) v Mexico (9,330km) up next in the beach volleyball. I know where my money is. And Indonesia, the world champions, are through in the mixed doubles badminton, soundly beating Thailand. <strong>They lie on the other side of the draw to Emms and Robertson</strong>, though.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>6.19am: Ancient Greek history class.</strong> Apparently gymnos is the Greek word for naked - which explains the vacuum-packed leotard arrangements. A gynasium was a place for exercising naked, rather than a place to go and smoke roll-ups behind, as is the modern meaning.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>6.24am: Team GB judo</strong> Michelle Rogers is taking on Jeong Gyeongmi of Korea, and it's 0-0. Apparently she went to the same school as Ryan Giggs.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>6.26am:</strong> Rogers has just conceded a 'koka' (complete guess), the smallest score available to competitors, apparently. GB 0-1 Korea</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>6.29am:</strong> British judo's Beijing suffocation continues, Rogers dumped out by the canny Korean. The smallest margin of defeat is still defeat, lest we forget.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>6.35am:</strong> China may have 19 gold medals (it's looking like that will be 20 shortly, as the men's gymnastics draws to a close) already (and the US topped the table at Athens with only 16 more than that)... but such international point scoring shouldn't be paid heed to, <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/08/14/why_medal_tables_have_nothing.html\">reckons Andy Bull</a>. And if you'd like a comprehensive rundown of this morning's swimming, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/14/olympics2008.olympicsaquatics5\">Robert Kitson has the word</a>.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>6.38am:</strong> Closer to home, the Blackwall tunnel is looking a bit grim. You don't want to get caught in a snarl-up there, I can tell you. Olympic Breakfast with Sue and Hazel coming up...</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>6.40am: China's Yang Wei takes gold in the men's all-round gymnastics</strong>, Japan finish with silver, while France nick a bronze.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>6.46am: Team GB</strong> Weather in Beijing has come over all BST, and as well as providing a convenient cue for Chilesey on the Beeb's couch, it's also contributed to the sailing being delayed this morning. Ben Ainslie and the Yngling girls, both leading their classes, will presumably get their booms back in order later on though.</p> <p><strong>In the boxing, we've got Blisterin' Billy Joe Saunders about to step out in the welterwight category.</strong> He's taking on Carlos Banteaux Suarez of Cuba - and the Cubans know how to produce a boxer, that's for sure: they won five golds in the ring four years ago.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>6.51am:</strong> Saunders bows to the four corners. The British southpaw is in blue, Banteaux red. Saunders is caught taking the fight to his opponent: CBS 4-1 BJS at the end of the first round.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>6.55am:</strong> The Caravan Kid, as I'm reliably informed Saunders is known, comes out swinging, but he has to beware Banteaux's counter-punching. Beautiful feint and he lands a left flush on the Cuban's chest. BJS pulls it back to 4-5 at the end of the second round.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>6.58am:</strong> Bit of handbags, the Cuban trying to hold Saunders and negate some of his energy. Banteaux is working cleverly on the inside, and despite his efforts BJS is unable to land more than one point in round three. 9-5 to CBS.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>7.02am: Saunders has to get his coat</strong>, after a bit of a schooling. Even when he was showboating, Banteaux landed the cleaner shots. Final second-round score, 13-6. Still, not a bad show from the Caravan Kid, who's only 18 and can look forward to going out in the semis at London 2012. Honk!</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>7.08am: China have collected their third gold of the day</strong>, although admittedly it was about half an hour ago. Du Li blew away the opposition in the women's 50m rifle. Katerina Emmons of the Czech Republic, the Games' <a href=\"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/olympics/2008-08/09/content_6920101.htm\">first gold medalist</a> came second, with Eglis Yaima Cruz of Cuba in third.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>7.15am: Team GB</strong> Smiley, smiley Shirley Robertson is broadcasting from Qingdao, where the sailors are concerning themselves with knots of the rope variety as there's no action on the water. Which allows me to segue neatly into Al Parke's zinger: \"I just realised (helped by <a href=\"http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Main_Page\">Wikipedia</a>), that Yngling is not a typo for \"Angling\". Angling did strike me as an odd Olympic sport. However, given that the games include something as bizarre as beach volleyball I thought nothing more of it.\" Al, if angling were an Olympic sport, <a href=\"http://sport.guardian.co.uk/pictures/image/0,10593,-10704317004,00.html\">Bob Nudd</a> would have his tackle out there in a shot - and we'd all be talking about it.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>7.24am:</strong> Canada are currently 1-0 up against the Americans in the women's softball. That'll smart, I imagine, if the Canucks win. Meanwhile, Robin Hazlehurst has written to express his concern about the nature of Du Li's victory: \"Blimey, have they changed the rules, I thought they were supposed to shoot at paper targets, not at each other.\" She metaphorically blew them away, Robin. It was basically a dressed-up lie.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>7.32am:</strong> We're currently in the fallow part of the morning, at least in terms of coverage on the gogglebox. Unless Steve Ovett has <em>actually</em> just won gold in the 800m. Apparently <strong>Team GB's Michelle Rogers, whom I castigated for defeat earlier, has made it into the judo repechage.</strong> So well done her.</p> <p>China are playing Poland over in the badminton mixed doubles. Not a cat-gut string between them currently.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>7.35am: Team GB boxing</strong> Tony Jeffries will go against Colombia's Eleider Alvarez in the light heavyweight class imminently.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>7.37am:</strong> Perfunctory boxing-into-the-camera from Jeffries. He received a bye in the first round, so this will be the first we've seen of him...</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>7.41am:</strong> Jeffries executes a few punch, miss, cock-your-arm moves. Whether that threw the Colombian, I don't know - but neither manages to score. Appears Jeffries was denied a scoring shot by the judges, though. 0-0</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>7.44am:</strong> Couple of close-range rabbit punches to the head from the Brit, but he's having difficulty scoring even when he manages to pop his opponent cleanly. Hope this isn't going to go the way of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/12/olympicgames.boxing\">Joe Murray</a>. 2-1 to Jeffries</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>7.48am:</strong> Battle proper is almost joined, but the fight continues to simmer. The Colombian keeps bringing down an overhand right which pulls him up score-wise - but the ref has warned Alvarez about ducking down. Solid jab to end the round from Jeffries. 4-3 to Jeffries</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>7.52am:</strong> Another good shot opens up a two point lead for Jeffries, but Alvarez is looking to finish strongly. He bangs Jeffries with an uppercut, and then takes one in the face which isn't scored for the GB boxer. Jeffries evades his opponent until the last 20sec when he pulls level... 5-5</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>7.53am: Tony Jeffries goes through</strong>, winning on the countback. He looked confident, but the fellas on the mics reckon it was mighty close.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>8.01am:</strong> The Chinese pair have beaten their Polish opposition in the badminton mixed doubles, 22-20, 23-21. <strong>Gail Emms and Nathan Robertson are up at around 2.15pm.</strong> And Kyle Hauptman has asked and answered his own question... \"The term 'the Mexican wave' has been on this blog a few times, instead of just 'the wave' as it is called in Canada, the US and some other places. Is there another kind of audience wave?\" Kyle enquired, only to follow up with the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_wave#Global_broadcasts\">Wiki's answer</a> a moment later. Apparently it's less Mexican than we've been led to believe...</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>8.08am:</strong> Anyway, there's only so much a box of Pro Plus and a plethora of Firefox windows can do for a man... I'm zonked. Howard Swains will be guiding you expertly through the tumult of 8-11 (and maybe a few minutes beyond). I'll leave you with <strong>Tony Jeffries wonderful Mackem brogue.</strong> He's pretty pleased to have beaten Alvarez a few minutes ago to reach the quarter-final. Shame his side will get a pummeling on Saturday when the Prem kicks off.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>8.13am:</strong> Morning all, and welcome to the hidden corner of Beijing known as Farringdon Road. Alan and Russell have successfully beaten off the email botherings of those in the southern hemisphere, which leaves me to deal with those early morning ramblings of anyone hauling themselves into the office in and around the GMT zone. Tell me what happened on the bus this morning by emailing here: <a href=\"mailto:hswains@gmail.com\">hswains@gmail.com</a>.</p> <p>Yesterday, having been thrown unawares into the minute-by-minute mix, each event was greeted on the television as something completely unexpected, and I rather enjoyed it. Today, I at least have some idea of what's coming up: we've got some <strong>baseball</strong>, <strong>softball</strong>, <strong>volleyball</strong>, <strong>handball</strong>, <strong>beach volleyball</strong>, <strong>water polo</strong>ball, <strong>boxing</strong>ball, <strong>judo</strong>ball, highball, lowball, stoolball, whiffleball, wallball and airflowball happening right now. </p> <p>I'd kind of been looking forward to watching Sunderland's Stadium of Light burger van proprietor <strong>Tony Jefferies</strong> taking his place in the Olympic ring, but it seems he's already boxed for the delectation of Alan Gardner, and won. See update at 7.53am. I guess all we can do is speculate on other unlikely professions for British Olympians or, indeed, Olympians from any other countries. I'd like to see a traffic warden in the dressage, or something like that.</p> <p>Still to come: <strong>table tennis</strong>, some <strong>canoe/kayaking</strong> and some <strong>sailing</strong>. Gold medal winners will be decided in the team <strong>dressage</strong>, <strong>judo</strong>, <strong>fencing</strong>, <strong>wrestling</strong> and some <strong>archery</strong>. Not sure if that will be on my watch or not, but you'll surely be here all day, right?</p> <p>In other non-Olympic competition, the battle is on to keep <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/aug/09/london.greyhoundracing\">Walthamstow Greyhound Track open</a>, although I'm indifferent on that one. I spent a night there a year or so ago and got well and truly duffed up by the bookies and their porridge-laden mutts. </p> <p>I also have a telephone date this morning with the incompetents at Iberia airlines, who lost my bag on a flight back from South America on Monday and are yet to locate either it or my flat, I'm not sure which. My phone charger was in that bag, meaning it is now out of juice, as was some expensive(-ish) hair product, which I'm reluctant to replace unless I have to, since I didn't want to buy it in the first place, but have now grown quite reliant on. Oh, there's also a bunch of dirty laundry in there, which they can keep.</p> <p>So, feel free to send in any ideas of how I can get them to do the laundry and deliver the bag; your memories of Walthamstow dog track; suggestions for professions for Olympians; or, if you must, anything about the greatest sporting event in the world.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>8.15am:</strong> Get your ears around this: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/audio/2008/aug/14/mike.adamson.olympics.update\">Mike Adamson reports from Beijing in our daily audio update</a>. Today, Mike talks to Lord Coe, who reckons we should not be expecting too much from our athletes (conveniently), and also attends a tense media briefing with Chinese authorities. There's also a results update, plus a run-down of what to expect for the rest of the day and the weekend.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>8.22am:</strong> The main BBC coverage is showing Olympic Breakfast, with Adrian Chiles and Hazel Irvine interviewing Britain's most decorated <em>Commonwealth Games</em> athlete of all time, Karen Pickering. She keeps all her medals in a plastic bag, apparently, but hopefully not next to a radiator, where they'd likely melt. Meanwhile, Brazil's Washington Silva just won in the <strong>boxing</strong> ring against Samir Bastie, with Ireland's Kenny Egan up next, against the Turkish boxer with a spectacular name: Muzaffer.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>8.26am</strong>: A couple of nice left-hand jabs from Kenny Egan -- the European championship bronze medal winner -- gives him a 2-1 lead at the end of the first round. It's a game of \"physical chess\", we're told.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>8.29am:</strong> The Dubliner Egan takes a 5-1 lead after the Turk walks onto a couple more left-handers. The fighters end up sprawled, greco-wrestling style on the mat at one point, at which the referee laughs. They get up and continue their neat dance. Meanwhile, in the judo hall, Great Britain's Michelle Rogers has lost in the repecharge to a German judo player, which saves us the trouble of figuring out what would have happened if she'd won. A shot at the bronze medal, I think, but am not sure.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>8.33am:</strong> Kenny Egan has got this bout wrapped up now, knockout notwithstanding. The Dublin fighter takes a seven-point lead into the final round after outfoxing his Turkish opponent. One right hook, in particular, is a belter. He leads 9-2.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>8.38am: </strong>\"What's the deal with the Beijinger?\" harrumphs Kevin Mackenzie. \"So far, for me anyway, its made like the British Olympic team on the gold position on the podium, and appeared only the once.\" Not sure about that Kevin, I'll get the techies onto it. Meanwhile, let's spin your disgruntled email into an advert. The Beijinger is guardian.co.uk's daily email update from the Olympics. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/series/thebeijinger\">You can read previous dispatches, or sign up, by clicking this blue text</a>. As expected, Egan won that bout 10-2 and is now one fight away from a medal for Ireland in the light heavyweight (81kg) division).</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>8.40am:</strong> \"Speaking of the Commonwealth games,\" says Manoj G. Menon, from Mumbai, \"I notice that the top nations in those games are barely registering on the Olympics tally. Canada &amp; South Africa are noticeably absent so far. India is struggling with one gold. Australia and GB are not doing that spectacularly either. Is it because the standard in Commonwealth sport is so abysmally poor?\" At the risk of giving a one-word answer (which would be \"yes\"), it's more the case that the other non-Commonwealth countries are pretty good too, I suppose. The Aussies usually do a bit better in the pool, of course, which could also explain it.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>8.46am:</strong> A quick update from around the channels: the <strong>canoe/kayak</strong> competition, in which a bunch of speed freaks and/or wannabe astronauts career down white-water rapids in a holed-out lolly stick, has been delayed because of rain. Seems rather like postponing the dressage because of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiWe8c5SbGY\">an infestation of horses</a> to me, but I don't make the rules. Also, the <strong>sailing</strong> has been cancelled today, because there's no wind. Jings. To compensate, \"Olympic Breakfast\" is showing a repeat of some archery, there's also some repeat of some gymnastics on an internet channel.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>8.51am:</strong> I think they call this a sloooow day, with news that the <strong>rowing</strong> has also now been postponed. That's rowing with oars, not arguing, which would make a fine Olympic sport. Thanks to Kate Bevis for this on the subject of the paid employment of Olympians: \"This morning Japanese TV treated us to a look at the office where yesterday's Japanese gold medalist (Ueno-san in the 70kg women's judo) works. I missed the start so I don't know what type of company it was, but it was very grey. They also showed us her desk which was described as \"very neat\" and sported a calendar with some arrows drawn on (training schedule?). Her co-worker then told us she \"helps to make databases\". She's only there until lunch though - after that she goes to the do-jo. In other exciting Japanese TV news, their 200m butterfly bronze medalist, Matsuda-san, started swimming in a greenhouse made from industrial strength clingfilm. The villagers put it up to cover the outdoor pool so the local children could practice in the winter. Even so the water temperature was only 10 degrees celcius.\"</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>8.58am</strong>: Italy has won a gold medal, thanks to Chiara Cainero, who is both skeet-shooting champion and a new model of 4WD SUV by the sounds of it. Cainero won a shoot-off against the American and German shooters.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>9.03am</strong>: There's really very little going on at the Games at the moment, so take a look back at what you've missed by clicking on any of the following:<br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/14/olympics2008.olympicsathletics1\">Political controversy: Coe dismisses Britain's chances</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/14/olympics2008.olympicsboxing1\">Boxing: Billy Joe Saunders beaten by Cuban</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/14/olympics2008.olympicsaquatics5\">Swimming: Kitajima seals double breaststroke gold</a></p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>9.13am: </strong>So, the weather is shocking in Beijing, bad enough to mean all the water-based sports (rowing and kayaking) are cancelled, but it's <em>not</em> bad enough to postpone the archery, in which competitors and thousands of spectators alike have been kitted out with the kind of ponchos given away beside the log flume at Alton Towers. These are presumably not arrow-proof, so let's hope the wind stays down.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>9.17am: </strong>This <strong>archery</strong> is riveting. The Korean archer Yun has just hit three nines (the outer gold), while the American Lorig got two eights (the inner red) and one nine. Yun leads after the first end. This is the semi-final, I think, although will confirm that as we go on.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>9.22am</strong> A relatively hopeless seven for Khaluna Lorig is followed by a ruthless ten from the Korean Ok-Hee Yun. Lorig responds with a ten, which puts the pressure back on Yun, and she can only manage an eight. Lorig then gets another eight and Yun a nine, so the Korean is leading 51-55 after six (out of 12) arrows.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>9.24am:</strong> The penultimate three-arrow end also goes to Yun, who pings a 9, a 10 and another 9. Lorig gets 8,8,10 and trails by six points with three arrows left. This one is done, pending disaster.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>9.26am:</strong> No surprises here as the favourite Ok-Hee Yun ousts the American Khaluna Lorig in what was actually the quarter-finals of the archery. In the final end, Lorig shoots 9,9,10, but leaves Yun only needing a five with her last arrow to win. She gets a 10, and takes her pink bow and fisherman's hat into the semi-final. It's hacking with rain, but the quality of the bow and arrow action defies the elements.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>9.30am:</strong> Simon Thomas has an idea on how to boost the British medal haul at the Games (and to diminish the achievements of the half-men/half-fish): \"It seems to me that swimming has far too many medals,\" he says. \"If you check out the list of past winners of the 100m, 200m and 400m at freestyle, medley and butterfly, the same names come up again and again. Solution: get rid of the 200m in all events and the individual butterfly completely. And since we'll all have a bit more time on our hands, stick back in a non-swimming event that we are really good at - the 1km cycling. Then the world (well, my house) will be at peace again.\" It's an idea. Let's give him that.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>9.37am:</strong> David Brigden is one of several of you now writing in with other stuff, presumably to save yourself from more arrow-by-arrow archery coverage. And, you know what, he's got an idea as well: \"Today has been a general and memorable discourse about the usefulness of medals table.\" (<a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/08/14/why_medal_tables_have_nothing.html\">see Andy Bull's excellent blog on that very subject</a>) \"So in this theme my suggestion (and secret wish) for the whole world to really remember these game in the true Olympic spirit, and not for the number of gold medals, is that instead of the usual \"end of games\" show, all participants including all backroom people, organisers, etc from all of the competing countries gather together in one humongous CONGA and dance around the streets of Beijing.\"</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>9.48am:</strong> Back to the archery arena, for my amusement if not necessarily yours. Interestingly, the competitors are summoned to the shooting line by what sounds like a car alarm going off, which also interrupts some dreadful national music, played for the crowd during the breaks. It reminds me of Eastern European turbo-folk, but has a more eastern flavour.<br>Anyway, once the shooting gets underway again, it's the quarter final between the Korean Kwon Un Sil and the 14-year-old Mexican sensation Marianna Avitia. Despite her tender years, Avitia is a dead eye with the bow and a real prospect for the future. In this, she's beaten 105-99 by the Korean, but I saw beware any teenager who can shoot an arrow. She's my early tip for gold in London in 2012.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>9.51am: </strong>The next quarter final is between Nam Hagakawa, from Japan, and Park Sung-Hyu, of Korea, the defending Olympic champion. The Japanese archer manages a fairly tame three eights; the Korean gets 9-8-9 and leads by two after the first end.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>9.53am:</strong> Devastating arrows from Park and there's no answer to that. She gets a perfect three tens, which is better than the 8-9-10 of her Japanese opponent. To paraphrase Sid Waddell: \"There's only one word for that - magic archery.\"</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>9.56am:</strong> Hayakawa is feeling the full force of Park's superlative arrowwomanship here and can only manage 7-8-9 from her three arrows, while Park gets a 9-10-10. \"That's just the way she operates,\" gushes the commentator. Park leads by nine with three arrows left.</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>10am:</strong> Even though she hits only a seven on her second arrow, Park manages two tens with the others and goes through to the semis 112-103, which is the highest of all four qualifiers. There are two from South Korea, one from North Korea and one from China in the semis. Meanwhile, Neil Stainthorpe, from Austria (who are presumably rubbish at archery), has an idea about the medals table: \"Wouldn't it be an altogether fairer system to organise the medals table by awarding, say, 3 points for a gold, 2 for a silver and 1 for a bronze and then ranking countries according to the total number of points? Why should a country which has won one solitary gold medal and nothing else be placed above a country which has won, for example, 10 silver and 10 bronze medals?\" This has definitely been spoken about before, Neil, but am not sure why it was rejected. Some newspapers do this kind fo thing anyway, which further undermines the authority of an \"official\" table. How about alphabetical order, huh? The Austrians would be still be pipped by Australia, though.</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>10.04am:</strong> William Fotheringham <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/08/14/five_factors_that_will_determi.html\">has been blogging about Great Britain's hopes in the velodrome</a>, and it's well worth a read - if you can tear yourself away from this archery. Richard Alderson has e-mailed on an almost similar subject: \"Remove Phelps from the equation and the Americans are having a shocker in this Olympics so far,\" Alderson says. \"Once all the boats and cycles come home over the weekend, it's not inconceivable that we might catch them.\" The problem is, we <em>can't</em> remove Phelps from the equation, because he's American and has now won 613 gold medals. It's like saying remove Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United, and Chelsea would have won the league.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>10.10am:</strong> Matt Warner is in Belgium, but that doesn't appear to be his fault: \"I recently moved to the chips and, it would appear, rain capital of Europe - Brussels,\" he laments. \"At my work people are carrying on as if the Olympics isn't happening with nary a mention in the first week. Is this because the Belgians are poop at everything - or are they going to come into their own in the next few weeks?\" I don't really know about the Belgians, but your office doesn't sound too dissimilar to this one, to be honest. Despite our committed band of sport beavers, life continues largely untroubled by the Olympics at Guardian Towers. There's more talk about A Levels today than anything Olympic, even though that very same dead horse is flogged annually, rather than every four years, like this one.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>10.20am:</strong> Everyone's got an idea of how to make archery more exciting (which gratifies me in some way, even though it implicitly implies that my coverage is boring). John Senior reckons they should host it at the Lakeside or Circus Tavern: \"Archery would be so much more exciting if they had beer-bellied Cockneys shouting out the score like in darts. The Korean's perfect score would have caused much more excitement accompanied by a long drawn-out \"THIRRRR-TEEEEEEYY!\"\", while Gordon PITTENDRIGH (who writes his surname in capitals, as though shouting it at someone who continually mispronounces or misspells it), suggests going feral: \"The archery would be monumentally more interesting and exciting if all the competitors were deposited in a forest and the last three standing could then have a shoot off against each others for the medals. Remember the Olympic motto - highest, fastest, strongest and bloodiest.\"</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>10.29am:</strong> Just in case you're baffled by all this, here's what's going on in the Olympics at the moment: hardly anything. The lightning, rain and (lack of) wind has put paid to the rowing, kayaking and sailing, while the only real action is the semi-finals of the women's archery and some basketball between Lithuania and Russia. Lithuania are three points up in the second period there. Charmian Owens, meanwhile, is disappointed by Seb Coe's view on the British track and field chances, which you can hear <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/14/olympics2008.olympicsathletics1\">in Mike Adamson's interview with Lord Seb</a>. \"Fair enough it is a concern that we are not medalling as we have done in the past at major championships, but we need to nurture the talent and develop our athletes' mental strength, which were I believe we lack,\" Charmian says. \"What will a statement coming from one of our Senior Olympic Official, do for team morale?\" Hear, hear. In brief: although Coe probably has a point, he probably shouldn't have said it.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>10.35am:</strong> Apart from the men's <strong>basketball</strong>, the Olympics this morning are all about heavily armed women. The <strong>skeet-shooters</strong> are now back at their shooting stations, where the commentary includes such gems as \"she unloads that spent cartridge and puts in another one\", while the dead-eye <strong>archers</strong> are doing their thing in the Beijing rain. It's the semi-finals there and I'll do some more arrow-by-arrow of the final, if no-one sees the sense to wrestle this keyboard out of my reach before then.</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>10.43am:</strong> OK, we're down to the finals in the archery and there's a vaguely interesting political showdown for the bronze medal, where the North Korean Un Sil Kwon is up against the South Korean Ok Hee Yun. Presumably, Seoul and Pyongyang have ground to a halt. Can the spirit of competition for third place in an Olympic competition heal the divide. We'll see. They were 55 apiece after the first six.</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>10.46am: </strong>In your face, Pyongyang! The South Korean Ok Hee-Yun proves that political liberation rather than nuclear oppression is the only real gateway to Olympic bronze, when she defeats Un Sil Kwon, from the North. The gold medal match to follow. David Lloyd (not that one, or that other one) is zinging this morning: \"With all this Asian domination of the archery one wonders why Kevin Costner never bothered entering for the USA.\" I get where this one is going. \"I remember seeing him in a film once about some blokes rushing around a forest with barely a gadget between them and he seemed to manage landing one pointed stick on top of another quite regularly. He even managed a few trick shots, eyes closed on horseback, from a flaming tree hut etc which if included would liven proceedings up considerably don't you think?\" Yes. Yes I do.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>10.50am:</strong> OK, China versus South Korea in this gold medal match, with Park Sung-Hyun representing the visitors and the vaguely Spanish-sounding Juan Juan Zhang up for the hosts. The Chinese nails a 10 on her first arrow, but lets her country, a billion viewers and herself down with a 7 on the next. Meanwhile, Park hits a 9 to start with, but goes into the lead with back-to-back 10s. Game on.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>10.53am:</strong> Still a two-point gap at the end of the second end, after Zhang gets three nines, and Park gets 8-8-10.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>10.57am:</strong> Great arrows from Zhang, who sends the home crowd delirious with a 10-9-10 to edge into the lead. Park only manages a 26 to the Chinese's 29.</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>11am:</strong> Amazing stuff here in the <strong>archery</strong> arena, where Zhang Juan Juan needs to score a nine with her final arrow to win the event and break one of the longest-standing strangleholds in any Olympic competition. The Koreans have never lost in this, but they have now! because Park picks out the gold in the centre of the target and wins herself a shiny gold medal, 110-109. The South Koreans get silver and bronze, but China take their 21st gold of the Games.</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>11.04am:</strong> Scott Murray has just shuffled into sight, and he'll be taking over here once he can find a chair, desk, television and computer. Such luxuries are by no means guaranteed when you sign up for a shift here. I'm not sure what he's going to write about to be honest: all we've got left is live basketball, a thriller between Lithuania and Russia (the Lithuanians lead 69-60 in the third quarter). Kevin McKenzie asks: \"For those of us reading your commentary on the fly at work and unable to watch on TV elsewhere, can you please explain what skeet shooting is?\" At the risk of providing another one word answer (which would be \"No\"), I'll try to describe what flashed up on the screen a few minutes ago, but which has since been replaced by judo repeats. It was kind of like clay-pigeon shooting in a rain and wind-swept heath somewhere, the likes of which I didn't know Beijing possessed. The shooters had some kind of shotgun thingy and were dressed in cagoules. Anyway, it's gone now, so let's pretend it never happened.</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>11.16am:</strong> It's a rainy day, and we're cashing in all the pennies saved up for Scott Murray, who is now in the house. He'll be taking you through to the end of this basketball match between Russia and Lithuania, and will also have the pleasure of Nathan Robertson and Gail Emms in the badminton, coming up soon. Thanks for your emails, and keep them coming for Scott. He's going to need them.</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>11.25am: <em>[MBM reporter sits down and begins to wing it, Barry Davies style]</em></strong> Morning everyone, to the Basketballing Jam Called Thursdays. Lithuania are five points ahead of Russia with two minutes to go. So are we all on the edge of our sea... ah. Minute-by-minute basketball, that it's come to this.</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>11.29am:</strong> It's 84-79 to Lithuania with 31 seconds remaining. Am I actually writing this?</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>11.29am and 20 seconds:</strong> There are 11 seconds remaining, a man has blown a whistle, and now Lithuania take a free pop at goal, or whatever. They're now 86-79 ahead, a timeout has been called by the Russians, and my admiration for the improvisational skills of Barry Davies over the years has just multiplied by 374,958.</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>11.32am:</strong> Peep peep peeeeeeep. That's it, Russia can't score at a rate of nearly a point a second to win - there's a surprise - and the Lithuanians prevail 86-79. They were \"consistent throughout the entire game in its entirety\", according to the commentator, which suggests basketball analysts are not much further advanced than their footballing counterparts. Lithuania top the group, while Russia, who have now lost three games, look a wee bit jiggered.</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>11.35am:</strong> Hazel Irvine on the BBC has just had a wee bit of fun with Thai boxer Non Boonjumnong's monicker. Apparently it's a bit of a tongue-twister! Really, are we not over this style of light banter in 2008?</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>11.46am:</strong> The laugh really is on Boonjumnong now, though. One of the favourites for gold in the welterweight Belting Seven Bells Out Of Folk sport - he won silver at the world championships last year - Boonjumnong's just been slapped all round the ring by Egypt's Hosam Abdin in the round of 16. According to the points system, if I understand it correctly, which I don't, the Egyptian hit his opponent 11 times on the head, while only being smacked in the mouth ten times himself. That's quite an upset.</p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>11.51am:</strong> Meanwhile, check out <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/feedarticle/7724295\">this toaster</a>! Swedish wrestler Ara Abrahamian has thrown the mother, father and extended family of all hissy fits after only winning bronze in the 84kg greco-roman boo hoo hoo. It's all to do with \"politics\", according to Abrahamian, who flung his medal away with all the style of a toddler dropping his ice-cream on the pavement. It's not exactly Tommie Smith and John Carlos circa 1968, now is it.</p> <!-- Block 103 --> <p><strong>O yay, O yay, 12 o'clock and all's well!</strong> Well, all's sort of OK, passable, but let's not split hairs on another lovely day of sport. A lovely day which can only be further embellished by clicking on <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/08/14/bumbling_bowlers_scoffing_swim.html\">this link</a>, which will in turn lead you to further YouTube links of Michael Phelps cramming junk food into his gaping maw, some classic Olympic action from 1908 (yes), and <em>that</em> interview with hitherto unrecognised comedy genius Schteve McClaren of Holland. Oh, and the big badminton match is on in 15 minutes, so please hang around. <em>Please.</em></p> <!-- Block 104 --> <p><strong>12.10pm:</strong> Mark Foster, flag-carrying Mark Foster, the man who embodies Britain - old, knackered and way past its best - has been knocked out of the 50m freestyle heats. Aw. <strong>China Weather News, presented by saucy weathergirl Richard Greaves:</strong> \"Just got back from my 80-minute cab ride there-and-back trip to the Kayaking where I sat in the rain for two hours only to be told the race would be postponed. Can anyone explain how wet it has to be to be too wet for kayaking?\" Wet it has to be to be too wet for kayaking? That sounds like a Bruce Forsyth catchphrase in the making.</p> <!-- Block 105 --> <p><strong>Smith &amp; Carlos It Ain't dept.</strong> \"Thanks for that link to the hissy fit,\" writes Steve Johnson, who I have to say seems very polite and well brought up. \"I have sympathy with the Swede though. I read the article only to find that 'Swedish wrestler Ara Abrahamian threw down his 84kg greco-roman bronze medal in protest'. I know these fellas should be pretty strong, but that's a bloody big medal to be lugging about.\" Ladies and gentlemen, remember the name, I'm sure you'll be hearing a lot more of him, put your hands together for Steve Johnson!</p> <!-- Block 106 --> <p><strong>12.16pm:</strong> Don't worry, you're missing no Emms-Robertson action. They're waiting for some other match to finish before they can start. Which gives us time to consider that great big gurning greco-roman galoot again, in <strong>Smith &amp; Carlos It Ain't dept. pt. II:</strong> \"So, the Swedish wrestler is lamenting that 'it's all politics',\" writes Gary Naylor, cueing himself up for the punchline. \"At the Olympic Games? Who'd have thunk it?\"</p> <!-- Block 107 --> <p><strong>12.20pm:</strong> Here's some risk-taking journalism for you: I'm off to suck down a cheroot, all the while hoping the Emms-Robertson stramash doesn't kick off before I get back. It's all OK, though: Tom Bryant is on hand to hold the fort should my little scheme somehow go cups up.</p> <!-- Block 108 --> <p><strong>12.26pm:</strong> As Scott poisons himself downstairs it appears his luck is out as Emms and Robertson are on the court and biffing the shuttle delicately back and forth between them and their opponents. They then manage to lose the serve at their first attempt. Good stuff.</p> <!-- Block 109 --> <p><strong>12.29pm:</strong> The Brits win a fantastic rally to take the scores to 2-2, prompting a clenched fist from Emms and some, \"I'm the man, me\"-style posturing from Robertson.</p> <!-- Block 110 --> <p><strong>12.30pm:</strong> Ah that's better. Thanks Tom. And thank you to Camel cigarettes. The Koreans are 5-3 up now, the 19-year-old Lee delivering a couple of tasty smashes in a row.</p> <!-- Block 111 --> <p><strong>12.33pm:</strong> Emms looks much the sharper of the British duo at the moment. Robertson slaps a hopeless smash into the net to fall behind 6-4, but Emms wallops two forehands past the Koreans to level the scores at 6-6.</p> <!-- Block 112 --> <p><strong>As Bruce Forsyth would say: How wet does it have to be to be too wet for kayaking, to be too wet for kayaking how wet does it have to be?</strong> \"I would think it more likely to be postponed due to possibility of lightning striking carbon fibre paddles,\" writes Claire Wright. \"I'd rather pull out than take a possible fry-up penalty! I think the fry-ups are better left to Mr Phelps.\"</p> <!-- Block 113 --> <p><strong>12.35pm:</strong> The Koreans have romped into a 10-7 lead, but a Robertson smash from the back court sets up Emms to put the return away. And then Robertson flicks one to the far corner to make it 10-9. Great! Ah, hold on, now it's 11-9, and time for a breather. Puff puff drink drinkity drink puff towel towel puff.</p> <!-- Block 114 --> <p><strong>12.40pm:</strong> Just a fantastic rally from Robertson, who smashes then dinks, dinks then smashes, and finally smashes the cock straight into the chest of Lee YD. He then runs around fistpumping like a lunatic. Is there really any need? When he put away the final point in the last round to put the Chinese number-two seeds out, he started running around in circles, much like Ray Wilkins did when he scored for Manchester United in the 1983 FA Cup final against Brighton. He barely gave poor Emms a cursory hug. There are two of you competing here, Robertson. As a team, yes?</p> <!-- Block 115 --> <p><strong>12.45pm:</strong> Emms and Robertson are 18-14 down. This set - is it called a set? - looks over for the British pair.</p> <!-- Block 116 --> <p><strong>12.46pm:</strong> Hold on, it's a game, not a set. Emms and MeMeMe are four game points down, 20-16. But they save the first two. It's 20-18 and hot, hot, hot.</p> <!-- Block 117 --> <p><strong>12.50pm:</strong> At 20-19, Mr Me sees his serve sail straight back past his lugs, and that's the first game to the Korean pair. \"Prior to the Emms-Robertson match was a thrilling Korea v China men's singles, which may yet have a bearing on the current mixed doubles game,\" reports Ben Roome, doing my job for me. He goes on to relate what appears to be an old episode of Jeux Sans Fronti\u00e8res: \"It was full of controversy, mascots falling over and being unable to get up, and the Korean Lee Hyunil to come from behind in the first game despite a terrible umpiring reversal that can only be put down to local pressure to quieten the partisan crowd and crush his opponent in the second. Hyunil demonstrated genuine mental and physical class in his win and as a result you could see the whole Korean badminton camp was lifted by his heroics. Having seen their boy win, I think the Koreans will feed off that and beat the UK pair too.\"</p> <!-- Block 118 --> <p><strong>12.52pm:</strong> Emms and Robertson have already let an early 2-0 lead slip in the second; they've got no answer to the much more mobile Koreans and are 5-2 down in the blink of an eye. British sport at its best!</p> <!-- Block 119 --> <p><strong>12.54pm:</strong> Mr I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I. Robertson delivers a decent smash to win a point, flexes his muscles Andy Murray style for the cameras for 17 minutes, then hoicks his very next shot straight into the net. Great. Britain. \"Has 'Team GB' won anything today?\" asks Oliver Pattenden, who knows the answer to his own question, I've never been more sure of anything.</p> <!-- Block 120 --> <p><strong>12.56pm:</strong> A couple of decent points from the Brits. Emms leaves a cheeky dink from Lee HJ, and it's a good call because the cock sails just outside the line. They draw level 8-8 - and then go ahead in a game for the first time in the match! 9-8. I should be cynical about British chances more often. Actually no, I probably shouldn't.</p> <!-- Block 121 --> <p><strong>12.58pm:</strong> Robertson attempts a dink over the net. The shuttle hits the cord and tips over, winning the point. Robertson struts around the court with his arms stretched out wide like Jesus. A Jesus who has just found the cure for cancer, fixed the hole in the ozone layer, and devised a macro-economic policy to eradicate the credit crunch. And yes, of course his very next smash pings into the net like a wet flannel. He's actually becoming increasingly entertaining, I'll give him that.</p> <!-- Block 122 --> <p><strong>1.02pm:</strong> The Koreans lead 13-11, Robertson finally finding his range and smashing down a beaut which the Koreans leave only for the perfect shot to find the back line. But Korea hit back immediately, then Emms hits two poor shots in a row - the first a simple smash into the net, the second a wayward swipe long and wide - and the Brits are 16-11 down and heading out.</p> <!-- Block 123 --> <p><strong>1.05pm:</strong> The Koreans are far too good. It's 18-11 and basically over. \"I do find the whole Team GB thing quite dispiriting,\" writes Chris Hatton. \"I enjoyed Euro 2008 much more because England didn't qualify - can we go for the same approach to London 2012 so we can actually enjoy sporting<br>excellence rather than being hammered relentlessly with the news that a<br>Team GB boxer has made it into the last 16?\" Sounds good to me. Chris Hatton is a Professor of Psychology, Health &amp; Social Care, by the way, so he knows what he's talking about. The mental equilibrium of the nation depends on our ability to heed what he's saying.</p> <!-- Block 124 --> <p><strong>1.06pm:</strong> Reacting to a shuttle toppling off the net cord, Lee Yongdee clips an exquisite and frankly outrageous return to set up nine match points. The first is saved, but there's to be no berserk comeback, as the very next point sees the Korean pair clinch victory, two games to nil. Instructively, Robertson does not run off the court in a huge semi-circle whooping and hollering.</p> <!-- Block 125 --> <p><strong>1.10pm:</strong> \"In small parts we were great,\" says Robertson in the post-match interview. No you weren't.</p> <!-- Block 126 --> <p><strong>1.11pm:</strong> The BBC interview goon insensitively asks Emms if she is definitely going to retire. She starts to cry. The interview goon makes no attempt to fill in the dead air time, but in fairness does stops just short of repeatedly poking Emms in the shoulder and chanting the word \"LOSER\". He switches to Robertson, who makes a bid for Kenneth Tynan/Sex Pistols foul-mouthed legend, but his \"we just wanted to bloody win it\" sounds too much like Alan Partridge bemoaning \"Sunday, bloody Sunday\" to be thoroughly convincing.</p> <!-- Block 127 --> <p><strong>1.16pm:</strong> It's the 800m women's freestyle, featuring Becky Adlington in heat 4, and this is not a live transmission I'll be bound. Let's see what happens here, then.</p> <!-- Block 128 --> <p><strong>1.18pm:</strong> I wonder if Adlington, who is <em>miles</em> ahead in this heat, will break the Olympic record?</p> <!-- Block 129 --> <p><strong>1.20pm:</strong> Yep. 8:18.06 is the fastest time in the world this year, the second fastest time in history, and an Olympic record. Gotta love Britain, right here! Emms and who in the what?</p> <!-- Block 130 --> <p><strong>1.23pm:</strong> \"I didn't expect that, I'm really pleased about that,\" smiles Adlington, barely out of breath as she comes out of the pool. No swearing, you'll note. And therefore no opprobrium.</p> <!-- Block 131 --> <p><strong>Groundless Optimism with guardian.co.uk and Andrew Moore:</strong> \"The Olympics always get going slowly for Britain, because our stronger events are always in the second half of the games. If the London organisers have any say over which order the events are scheduled surely we should schedule our strongest event early so that we can get off to a flier and get people excited. It would be a disaster if the nation is sitting around in 4 years time, waiting for the swimming and greco-wrestling to finish before it can start flag-waving.\" You do realise the second half of the Games is basically the athletics, Peter? I'm only trying to manage expectations here.</p> <!-- Block 132 --> <p><strong>1.40pm:</strong> There's a bit of a lull now, which opens a lovely cigarette window for your honest hack. Just in case anything happens in the next few minutes, while I slope off to wheech down a fag, Tom Bryant is keeping an eye out. I'll be back very soon, probably to find Tom reporting on the biggest Olympic story to break since Ben Johnson was busted in 1988.</p> <!-- Block 133 --> <p><strong>1.44pm:</strong> <strong>BREAKING NEWS - massive drugs bust at Olym ...</strong> just kidding. In real news, British swimmer Gemma Spofforth has come in sixth in her 200m backstroke heat in 2:10.58, which probably won't be good enough for her to progress. \"That could have gone better,\" she says, unsurprisingly, before admitting that she was over-excited.</p> <!-- Block 134 --> <p><strong>1.48pm:</strong> \"This, for me, is probably the weaker of the 200m backstroke heats,\" says the man from the BBC as the swimmers sets off at a blistering world record pace, eventually finishing with Kirsty Coventry claiming an Olympic record of 2:06.76. That, right there, is incisive commentary.</p> <!-- Block 135 --> <p><strong>1.52pm:</strong> In the next heat, our very own Elizabeth Simmonds goes out as if she's got an outboard hidden under her cossie - the sort of pace at which you'd expect her to run out of steam, mid-length, and drown. Fortunately that doesn't happen and she touches home in first with a new British record of 2:08.66 and in second place for the semi-final. Spofforth has also crept in. Woo! for the Brits.</p> <!-- Block 136 --> <p><strong>1.55pm:</strong> And woo! for Tom Bryant. Thanks for that. And woo! for the Olympics, for suddenly nothing whatsoever is happening. Everyone's kicking back a while.</p> <!-- Block 137 --> <p><strong>2pm:</strong> Hold on! Roger Federer is a set down to James Blake in the tennis. And it's 5-4 in the second set; Federer will be serving to keep his chance of gold alive.</p> <!-- Block 138 --> <p><strong>GOOD SUBSTANCE ABUSE JOKE:</strong> \"Glad to hear that for Becky Adlington, there was, as you say, 'no opprobrium',\" writes Al Parkes. \"The taking of any performance enhancing drugs is something we should all<br>condemn.\" Federer double faults to give Blake a window of opportunity; it's 15-30 in a game the Swiss has to win.</p> <!-- Block 139 --> <p><strong>2.04pm:</strong> Federer was 30-30 and on his second serve, but a brilliant serve-and-volley wins the point; one more and that's 5-5 in the second set of this quarter final.</p> <!-- Block 140 --> <p><strong>2.08pm:</strong> A scream of anguish from Federer at 30-30 as he overhits a forehand when it was certain he'd earn himself a break point. Blake serves out to go 6-5 up. Once again Federer must serve to stay in the tournament.</p> <!-- Block 141 --> <p><strong>2.13pm:</strong> Two careless forehands from Blake at 0-15 and 15-30. Then Federer nearly smashes a sitter of a volley into the net, but lucks out as the ball pings off the cord and topples over into Blake's court. Federer goes on to hold his serve - without once getting a first serve in. It's going to a tiebreak.</p> <!-- Block 142 --> <p><strong>2.13pm:</strong> Blake is up in the tie-break, 4-1. Over at the light welterweight boxing, Britain's Bradley Saunders, to give him his full name, has been beaten 11 smacks upside the head to 7 punches in the mouth by Alexis Vastine of France.</p> <!-- Block 143 --> <p><strong>2.17pm:</strong> Federer is hanging by a thread. He's 5-2 down in the tie-break, and Blake has two serves to come.</p> <!-- Block 144 --> <p><strong>2.18pm:</strong> Blake pushes Federer to the back of the court with a series of ferocious forehands to give himself four match points. He only needs one: Blake is through to the semi-finals at the expense of the big man.</p> <!-- Block 145 --> <p><strong>2.20pm:</strong> It's the hockey! And Barry Davies! And where were the Germans? And frankly, who cares? Anyway, it's New Zealand v \"Great\" Britain in the women's tournament, and it's live, live, live. Both teams really need to win if they want any realistic hope of making the semi finals, so here goes.</p> <!-- Block 146 --> <p><strong>2.25pm:</strong> Britain haven't shown much up front so far, until Danson goes, er, dancing through the Kiwi defence and would have got a strike on goal were it not for a team-mate getting in the road. That's a long corner, a set piece which, rather like the corner in British association football, is routinely wasted. Does anyone ever score from them?</p> <!-- Block 147 --> <p><strong>2.30pm:</strong> They score from penalty corners, though. Gemma Flynn of New Zealand gets on the end of a routine and clips the ball into the goal from a sharp angle on the right. That's 1-0 to the Kiwis. This is a pretty appalling day for Britain, isn't it. But let's face it, roaring success would just make us feel uneasy. This is what we know, it feels safe like this.</p> <!-- Block 148 --> <p><strong>2.32pm:</strong> Here's a thing, though, this Danson looks some player. Whenever she gets the ball she invariably beats two or three opponents with a mazy dribble.</p> <!-- Block 149 --> <p><strong>2.33pm:</strong> And it's 1-1! Richardson and Wright combine well down the right, the latter crossing for Craddock who flicks on to Danson to guide a high ball home. That, ladies and gentlemen, is hockey.</p> <!-- Block 150 --> <p><strong>2.40pm:</strong> Craddock twists and turns down the left and wins a penalty corner after... er... yes. The hooter goes, but there's still time to take the set piece - and Panter whacks it home for Britain! Unfortunately, she is judged to have swept the ball into the goal, which is apparently not cricket in hockey, so it's disallowed and the score remains 1-1 at half-time. Although the official Olympic on-screen graphic insists it is 2-1 to Britain. It is 1-1 though. Er. Barry Davies is frothing indignantly at the decision, his funk mothership sailing right into the hot, hot heat of the sun.</p> <!-- Block 151 --> <p><strong>2.53pm:</strong> And we're off again, after ten minutes of Equestrian Dressage which caused minor blood clots in both of your MBM reporter's eyes. And with half an hour to go, Britain win a penalty corner after a Kiwi attempts to juggle the ball out of the area with their knee, Ronaldinho style. Not that it matters, the subsequent set-piece being eventually hoofed away by the keeper. This is just turning into a kickabout.</p> <!-- Block 152 --> <p><strong>2.57pm:</strong> This is all Britain, is this. Craddock flicks the ball up on the left and hits a reverse pass into the area which Danson nearly guides home with the back of her stick. I have no idea whatsoever if any of that was legal but it sure looked skilful.</p> <!-- Block 153 --> <p><strong>3.01pm:</strong> Cullen has just wheeched a penalty corner into the net for Britain with just under 20 minutes left on the clock. They're 2-1 up; to be honest I didn't see much difference with her strike and the disallowed one by Panter on the stroke (literally) of half time. Still, all good and well. \"Is this reality or are you trapped in some kind of OBOer's nightmare, where random sports hove into view then disappear again for no reason?\" asks Chris Hatton, who you may or may not recall is a Professor of Psychology, Health &amp; Social Care. \"The mention of Barry Davies was the clincher for me - surely he went over the Reichenbach Falls in a final struggle with John Motson some time ago?\" Oh it's reality alright, but by no means a nightmare. This hockey is fantastic, for example, and Nathan Robertson's preposterous antics were a strange joy to behold. Although during the Dressage the words \"class\" and \"war\" did keep scrolling across my line of sight, much like the end credits of Crossroads. Does that count as a nightmare, Professor Hatton?</p> <!-- Block 154 --> <p><strong>3.07pm:</strong> Fifteen minutes to go. Team GB are still 2-1 up. Can we please hold onto <em>something</em> today?</p> <!-- Block 155 --> <p><strong>3.08pm:</strong> Unlike Gerard Depardieu, Forgesson of New Zealand is given a green card.</p> <!-- Block 156 --> <p><strong>3.10pm:</strong> Cullen handles in the area, I think. Whatever she's done, she ain't done no good, for the New Zealand team are awarded a penalty corner. It's cleared, though the Kiwis are turning the screw. \"Worrying moments for Great Britain,\" says Barry Davies. Those five words may as well be recorded by the BBC and played on 24-hour loop for the entire duration of the athletics.</p> <!-- Block 157 --> <p><strong>3.16pm:</strong> Britain knock it around the back for a while. Barry Davies has got the regal funk on because Britain's play is \"difficult to describe as progressive\". There's little better on national television than Barry Davies in a self-righteous stew.</p> <!-- Block 158 --> <p><strong>3.19pm:</strong> With four minutes to go, Britain are awarded a penalty corner. It's wasted. But they pin New Zealand back in their own half for a couple of minutes. The clock is ticking.</p> <!-- Block 159 --> <p><strong>3.23pm:</strong> And that's it! Britain beat New Zealand 2-1, mainly down to Storry in the goal, who flung herself spectacularly at a penalty corner, a save I might not actually have described at the time. That keeps alive their outside chances of a place in the last four. So there's something to cheer about at the end of a dismal day at the Olympics for Team GB. Still, let's not be miserable about it, what did you expect? We're only Britain, after all.</p>"
