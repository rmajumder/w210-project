  "<p>God wants you rich, and as if to prove it His golden forefinger is pointing down through the stage ceiling at the Excel exhibition centre in east London.</p> <p>This is the International Gathering of Champions, one of the largest worship meetings of Pentecostalists ever held in Britain, and the three-metre (10ft) digit hanging above the preachers is a sign that they and the 80,000 who will come to hear them are, in the words of Deuteronomy, \"empowered to prosper\".</p> <p>It may seem like a Monty Python comedy prop, but how to get rich and then how to get richer is the message of this eight-day meeting of mostly west African and Caribbean Christians, which reaches a climax this weekend. In other words, the Bible is the business plan and Jesus is the financial adviser-in-chief.</p> <p>The loudest amen went to a preacher who told a parable of an IT consultant who went forth and multiplied his salary by 10. Thousands cheered as the preacher explained how a young man with few qualifications started on \u00a314,000 a year and wound up working for a Swiss bank on \u00a3140,000. </p> <p>\"Get your calculators out, I know this is going to beep your horn,\" the preacher yelled. </p> <p>In tightening economic times it is a popular message, and the event's attendance - 12,000 are expected at the closing service on Sunday night - sets a new tidemark for the fastest growing branch of Christianity in Britain. </p> <p>Already an estimated 300,000 people attend Pentecostal services every Sunday and the gap is closing with the Church of England, which welcomes a congregation that has fallen beneath a million.</p> <p>At the Excel centre, the star turn is Matthew Ashimolowo, a 56-year-old, golf-loving Nigerian TV preacher and leader of the Kingsway International Christian Centre, Britain's biggest Pentecostal church. Already he preaches to 8,000 every Sunday in east London, and his sermons are broadcast 24 hours a day on Sky and around the world.</p> <p>This week, Ashimolowo's church announced ambitious expansion plans. KICC will build churches in Scotland and the north of England and launch a summer music festival for 50,000 which could be held in Hyde Park. Plans for a 10,000-capacity mega-church in London are to be considered by ministers.</p> <p>\"We are aiming to break into the mainstream of British society,\" said Pastor Dipo Oluyomi, chief executive of the KICC. \"We will be establishing city churches in Manchester, Leeds and Edinburgh.\"</p> <p>The move follows a controversial period for the church. The management of the charity which ran the church was criticised following a Charity Commission investigation in 2005. It resulted in Ashimolowo repaying \u00a3200,000 to the charity. The watchdog had discovered financial irregularities which included the charity's assets being used to buy a \u00a380,000 car and a \u00a313,000 timeshare in Florida for Ashimolowo.</p> <p>The church was also evicted from its headquarters to make way for the London 2012 Olympics, and its planning application to build on a site in Rainham was turned down following vociferous local opposition.</p> <p>But despite the setbacks, KICC has continued to grow through its \"prosperity gospel\", a \"God wants you rich\" philosophy that originated in Oklahoma and has spread throughout America and Nigeria. This week Ashimolowo claimed: \"I have changed the landscape of the Christian church in the UK.\"</p> <p>The growth of Pentecostalism has attracted the interest of universities in Britain, Germany and the Netherlands, which have launched a \u20ac500,000 (\u00a3400,000) research project into the trend.</p> <p>\"This has become a social force in the new Europe, but one that is usually marginalised and misunderstood,\" said Alan Anderson, professor of global Pentecostal studies at the University of Birmingham. </p> <p>\"The growth of churches like KICC is because of the continuing influx of west Africans. It becomes a place where they can feel at home and every facet of human life is catered for, and we should look at it as a very positive force for society.\" Students, solicitors and police officers as well as young mothers and pensioners attended the gathering this week. </p> <p>\"This is a place where people can feel a sense of connectedness, and they use the pastors as mentors who they can look to for direction,\" said Oluyomi. \"We have career counselling, legal guidance and marriage help. We are making ourselves relevant to the community.\"</p> <p>KICC even supplies GCSE tuition.</p> <p>\"Pastor Matthew Ashimilowo is my motivator and an inspiration because of what God has done in his life,\" said Maria Adiseyeye, a student from Hackney. \"I have changed from knowing gang lifestyles now that I know God is preparing me to be a role model in the future.\" </p> <p>On stage the giant finger hovers above Ashimolowo as he delivers his session entitled Follow Your Financial Map to Success. He gets a huge roar for his prayer that everyone pays off their mortgage soon and remarks that 38 of the Bible's 59 parables are about economics.</p> <p>The economics of the church are transparent. At the end of a rousing sermon by the Nigerian bishop David Oyedepo, direct debit forms are handed round and the congregation are encouraged to make an \"empowerment offering\". KICC operates a system of tithes where worshippers consider it their duty to donate 10% of their gross income to the church. Each year, KICC said, it turns over around \u00a39m - most of it from these donations.</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p>Kingsway International Christian Centre is the largest Pentecostal church in western Europe and preaches the \"health and wealth\" strand of the faith popular with migrant African communities. It launched in 1991 in an east London school with 300 members. Now, led by the Nigerian TV preacher Matthew Ashimolowo, left,it attracts 12,000 worshippers every Sunday. Also significant is the Redeemed Christian Church of God, which started in Nigeria and now has more than 250 congregations in the UK, the largest of which is Jesus House in London, with 3,000 members. Across the UK at least 300,000 people attend Pentecostal services each week, which means the faith is gaining on the Church of England, which recently saw Sunday attendances drop beneath 1m. The KICC is planning expansion, with new churches in Leeds, Manchester and Edinburgh and, is appealing against the refusal of a planning application to build a 10,000-seat church in east London. The biggest Pentecostal churches remain abroad. The Faith Tabernacle in Nigeria hosts 50,000 for Sunday worship.</p>",
  "<p>From new mums worried about their children's health to foodies seeking the very finest products, consumers have embraced organic food with more enthusiasm than most environmental trends.</p> <p>But now the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/29/organics.food\">British love affair with organics has stalled</a> in the face of rising prices and tightening budgets as mortgage and fuel bills bite and fears rise over job losses.</p> <p>The market research company TNS keeps track of the shopping habits of 25,000 households and has watched organic sales rise tenfold in the last 10 years to more than \u00a31.3bn a year, though this still accounts for only a few percent of total food and drink sales. But the latest figures show the biggest and most consistent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/29/organics.food1\">fall in organic food and drink sales</a> for a decade - by nearly a fifth from their all-time peak in February. </p> <p>The steepest decline has been in eggs. Market research carried out for the Guardian by TNS shows organic egg sales down 18% in the four weeks to August 10, compared to the same period last year, as shoppers appear to be opting for cheaper, but still ethical, free range products.</p> <p>Among the many affected farmers are father and son Dennis and Chris Ball, whose farm in south Wales switched to organic eggs more than a decade ago. The Balls are among a number of egg producers reported to be quitting their organic status. The final straw was a letter from their buyer saying it no longer wanted organic eggs because customers have been abandoning the sector en masse. \"We thought it was getting too tight anyway,\" said Dennis Ball. \"This letter really emphasised it and we said 'that's it'.\"</p> <p>Noble Foods, the UK's biggest egg marketer, said the TNS research showed the fall in organic sales has been accelerating over the past year. Noble Foods has converted back some of its own farms and advised other producers to do the same because the company can no longer pay premium organic prices.</p> <p>Beyond eggs, there is also evidence of conversions into organic production slowing sharply. A report for the National Farmers Union based on figures to March showed ongoing conversions into organic milk halved last year.</p> <p>The Soil Association reports only \"one or two places\" leaving, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/29/organics.food\">Helen Browning</a>, the director of food and farming, said that its members tended to be smaller and more specialised. The implication is Soil Association members are less likely to be at the forefront of a mass retail trend.</p> <p>Reasons for the decline vary widely: a poor summer for barbecuing; falling public confidence in the benefits of paying extra for organic produce; and even concerns that more land and labour-intensive organic production is exacerbating the recent surge in food prices. The single greatest issue cited by farmers and retailers alike, however, is the credit crunch. Organic food is just one of many examples of customers trading down. </p> <p>At the Tortworth Estate farm shop near Bristol, manager Simon Ball said there had been a noticeable fall in sales of organic eggs and bread as customers trade down to free range and premium lines. \"It doesn't sound like much but it all adds up,\" said Ball. \"That's the little ways people are saving pennies at the moment.\"</p> <p>In Wales, Dennis Ball says he is unlikely to convert back to organic production because it would be too time consuming and expensive: \"Once the ground has been declared non-organic you shouldn't go back to it,\" he said. But the Soil Association believes most organic buyers will stay loyal. \"These values are important to people still,\" said Browning.</p>",
  "<p>In terms of the women's game Anne Keothavong is something of a late developer but at 24 she seems to be coming of age. Today she will have the chance to continue that progress when she takes on the fifth seed, Elena Dementieva, in the third round of the US Open.</p> <p>The Londoner's world ranking has risen from 151 a year ago to a recent career-high of 76 and even if she loses to Dementieva, who won the singles gold medal in Beijing, she could go up from her current standing of 87 to as high as 70. Indeed, she has a realistic chance of breaking into the world's top 50 before the year is out, which would mean a more regular place in the top tier of the WTA Tour - and she is the first British woman to win back-to-back main-draw matches at the US Open since Jo Durie and Sara Gomer in 1991.</p> <p>She said she was pleased to bring the spotlight on to Britain's women. \"It's a nice feeling, just to get women's tennis out there,\" she said. \"There are women out there who are doing things in British tennis, and it's nice to know that it's not just Andy Murray out there.\" </p> <p>That she has made a bit of history by reaching the third round is indicative of the barren ground from which Britain's more talented female players have been expected to grow over the past two decades, but Keothavong is one of those benefiting from a radical change of approach to women's tennis at the Lawn Tennis Association.</p> <p>That change has happened only in the last 2\u00bd years since the new regime under the chief executive, Roger Draper, began investing funds and providing a long-neglected group of coaches and players with a more structured approach under the head of women's tennis, Carl Maes, and head women's coach, Nigel Sears, both of whom have experience of working with world-class players such as Kim Clijsters and Daniela Hantuchova.</p> <p>Keothavong, along with players such as Elena Baltacha, Katie O'Brien and Laura Robson, this year's junior Wimbledon champion, has access to the facilities at the LTA's National Tennis Centre in Roehampton and can draw on the advice of coaches, fitness and conditioning trainers, nutritionists, psychologists and other experts.</p> <p>\"Most of the top-end players now have a team support group,\" said Sears. \"Claire Curran and I do Anne's coaching. Claire will travel with her for 10 or 11 weeks of the year; I'll go to each of the grand slams and when we can't be there will send one of the other coaches or a trainer so she is supported by four or five people throughout the year.\"</p> <p>Although Keothavong is grateful for the support, she is too independent a personality to put her improvement down purely to the new environment. This is a player who broke into the top 100 after years of trying in May this year, not in a match with the cameras rolling and the flashbulbs popping at Wimbledon but by winning a tournament in Jounieh, 10 miles north of Beirut, during an outbreak of fighting.</p> <p>\"I felt like I did it myself and I was quite proud of that,\" she said. \"That was quite a big thing. But Claire's been helping me, Nigel's been helping me and that's been great and they've been really good to me and I need that kind of support. It's OK to be on your own for a while but sometimes you need someone to kick you up the arse.\"</p> <p>Keothavong is not only climbing at her own pace, she is doing it her own way too.</p> <h2>Pre-match superstition</h2> <p>As well as talent and determination, Anne Keothavong's success at the US Open has also seemingly been influenced by visits to a French bistro in Manhattan. The 24-year-old ate at Seppi's prior to her two victories at the tournament and, believing in superstition, she will do so again before facing Elena Dementieva.</p> <p>\"I have to order the creme brulee and my coaches must sit in the same seats,\" said the world No87.</p>",
  "<p>Aegis, the UK media buying group, yesterday reported a strong underlying pre-tax profit boost of 15.4% to \u00a356.2m in the first half of 2008, and said it expected full-year results at the \"upper end\" of expectations despite the slowing market.</p> <p>The group, whose subsidiaries include media buying agency Carat, digital network Isobar and research firm Synovate, posted a 13.7% increase in revenue compared with the equivalent period last year to \u00a3607.6m on a constant currency basis.</p> <p>Analysts had been forecasting revenues of around \u00a3580m. Underlying operating profit rose 16.7% on a constant currency basis to \u00a365m, while the profit margin rose from 9.7% to 10.7% year on year. Aegis said the results had been driven by solid organic growth, the rise of emerging markets, strategic acquisitions and a 13% strengthening of the euro against the pound, which benefited its operations in mainland Europe. Exchange rate effects contributed \u00a335.5m to the company's \u00a3607.6m revenue.</p> <p>Despite the solid results, Aegis aired a note of caution for the future. \"We achieved these results despite a trading environment that is becoming tougher - with signs of slowing demand, particularly in Spain, the US and the UK,\" said the chief executive, Robert Lerwill. \"Consequently our revenue outlook for the second half of 2008 is less certain.\"</p> <p>He said Aegis anticipated a lower rate of market growth in the second half of the year and was therefore \"taking some early steps to tighten our cost base in a number of markets ... Nonetheless we remain confident of delivering a result for the year at the upper end of market expectations.\" </p> <p>The company said 29% of revenue at Aegis Media came from digital operations, up from 26% in 2007.</p>",
  "<p>Children who receive a rich variety of home learning before they start school achieve better results in maths tests at 10, according to a government-funded study into childhood learning. </p> <p>The researchers said the benefits of reading to children, playing with numbers and shapes, teaching them nursery rhymes and taking them to the library were detectable in addition to the influence of their parents' wealth and level of education. The study also found that children who attended quality preschool education did better at 10. </p> <p>Professor Edward Melhuish at Birkbeck, University of London, who led the research said the results showed that a combination of a good home learning environment, good preschool education and a good primary school were all important for later results.</p> <p>He said that without these benefits an average child from a poor background would be in the bottom 20% at school, but with all three advantages it would, on average, move into the top 20%.</p> <p>\"There are plenty of mothers who aren't very well educated who provide a great home environment and conversely some highly educated parents who don't provide such a good home environment,\" Melhuish said.</p> <p>The study followed nearly 3,000 children at more than 800 primary schools from three onwards. It is the largest study to look in such detail at the educational development of children in the general population. The analysis, which is published in Science, focused on achievement in maths tests at age 10.</p>",
  "<p>More than a million people have been forced from their homes and 250,000 houses destroyed in one of the worst floods in northern India for decades, prompting accusations that the destruction was manmade.</p> <p>The prime minister, Manmohan Singh, called the flood a \"national calamity\" after the Kosi river burst its banks in Nepal 10 days ago, sending waves of water across a swath of the eastern flank of the Himalayas and submerging large parts of the Indian state of Bihar. </p> <p>Yesterday the Indian army was mobilised - evacuating more than 100,000 people and dropping food supplies from the air. Pratyaya Amrit, Bihar's secretary for disaster management, said more than 400,000 people would be moved to relief camps by the weekend.</p> <p>Singh and Sonia Gandhi, head of the ruling Congress party, flew over devastated areas by helicopter yesterday. The prime minister later said more helicopters would be used to rescue thousands of villagers marooned in distant villages and assured them of more financial assistance. </p> <p>The US announced a $100,000 flood-relief package for the victims. Aid agencies, including Unicef, are in Bihar distributing food, clothes and medicines. </p> <p>\"We have the army, disaster management teams, police and other groups of rescuers making every effort to save the population,\" said RK Singh, a senior disaster management official.</p> <p>Relief agencies said that Bihar's status as the poorest, most deprived state in India meant victims of the annual monsoons were especially vulnerable.</p> <p>Thomas Chandy, chief executive officer for Save the Children, said: \"During our flood response last year we found that the levels of children trafficked from the state increased in large numbers. Two of the affected districts, Arraria and Katiyar, according to our study, have the highest instance of child trafficking. The current disaster will increase levels of poverty and desperation and create a favourable environment for traffickers.\"</p> <p>Experts said corruption in India was largely responsible for the disaster. The Kosi's embankment is meant to handle almost 1m cubic feet of water per second, yet the river was breached at around a tenth of capacity, pointing to serious defects in the river system.</p> <p>Nepal, where the Kosi originates, accused India of failing to uphold its commitment, under a 1954 treaty, to maintain the embankment. India claims that its engineers cannot get access to the river.</p> <p>But Himanshu Thakkar, coordinator of the independent South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People said: \"The monsoon comes every year. Why weren't they ready for the disaster? The fact is that there was much less flow in the river than the stated capacity, which exposes the kind of maintenance that was done.\"</p> <p>Thakkar said that there was an \"unfortunate lobby consisting of politicians, bureaucrats, builders and engineers who take money and don't do any work. There is no oversight of this process. That's why we get flooding every year.\"</p> <p>Torrential rains have killed more than 1,000 people in South Asia since the monsoon began in June, mainly in India's northern state of Uttar Pradesh, where 725 people died. Other deaths were reported from Nepal and Bangladesh.</p>",
  "<p>Gary McKinnon, the British computer hacker who cracked open the Pentagon and Nasa systems in the US, has lost his appeal to the European court of human rights and could face immediate extradition to the US to stand trial. His lawyers indicated last night that they were urging the home secretary to allow McKinnon to stand trial in the United Kingdom as he had recently been diagnosed as suffering from Asperger's syndrome.</p> <p>McKinnon, 42, from Bounds Green, north London, who has been described in the US as the biggest military hacker of all time, faces a series of charges in the US in connection with hacking activities that took place nearly 10 years ago. He is alleged to have broken into 53 US army, 26 US navy and 16 Nasa computer systems and to have caused $700,000 (\u00a3380,000) damage to the systems, in which he left disparaging messages about their security arrangements.</p> <p>He lost his appeal against extradition in the House of Lords following a hearing last month in which it was argued that if he were to stand trial, it should be in the UK. He was granted a temporary stay by the European court on August 12 after applying to it for \"interim relief\". The temporary stay was lifted yesterday. \"The offences for which our client's extradition is sought were committed on British soil and we maintain that any prosecution of our client ought therefore to be carried out by the appropriate British authorities,\" his lawyer, Karen Todner, said yesterday. \"Our client faces the prospect of prosecution and imprisonment thousands of miles away from his family in a country in which he has never set foot.\"</p> <p>Todner added: \"Our client's case highlights a worrying trend where UK citizens are at the mercy of the ever-increasing tendency of overseas prosecutors to extend their jurisdiction to crimes allegedly committed in this country.\" As McKinnon had been diagnosed as suffering from Asperger's syndrome, she was writing to the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, inviting a prosecution in this country. </p> <p>James Welch, legal director of Liberty, said: \"It is a shame that the court of human rights will allow his extradition even as they consider whether US extradition measures were fair.\"</p> <p>McKinnon, 42, was inspired as a teenager in 1983 by the film WarGames, in which a teenager hacks into the Pentagon system. He started hacking into American military and space computer systems because he believed they contained information about UFOs. His alleged hacking activities took place between 1999 and 2002, when he was arrested. He denies that his activities threatened US security.</p> <p>He also declined a deal by the US authorities in which they would agree to a short sentence which could be partly served in the UK if he agreed to be extradited and plead guilty. Technically, he could face 60 years in jail in the US although the actual sentence is likely to be much shorter.</p>",
  "<p>Uefa is to launch an investigation into the major financial challenges facing European football, including club debts and the inequality between rich and poor teams. A panel of legal and financial experts will carry out the inquiry, announced in Monaco yesterday, and make recommendations on how to create what Michel Platini, Uefa's president, described as \"a level playing field\" between clubs.</p> <p>Platini said his major concern is the high level of debt carried by some clubs, reiterating his opinion that clubs are \"cheating\" when they buy players they cannot afford. He insisted he was not referring to English clubs alone - Manchester United and Chelsea owe a combined total of \u00a31.5bn according to their most recent accounts - pointing to clubs elsewhere in Europe, including Celta Vigo in Spain, which have over-reached themselves financially and collapsed, as Leeds United did five years ago. \"European football must be clean and transparent and we do not want clubs buying success on credit,\" Platini said.</p> <p>He added that the panel will also inquire into how a level playing field between clubs can be created, but accepted that rich clubs will oppose any moves to trim their TV income from Uefa's own competition, the Champions League.</p> <p>With the big clubs now working more closely with Uefa following the effective disbandment of G14, Platini is keen not to antagonise them and acknowledged that Europe's biggest and richest clubs give the Champions League its glamour and appeal - and its massive TV revenues.</p> <p>\"We have to find the golden mean, the right balance,\" he said. \"There have always been rich and poor clubs, the rich get richer and the poor want to take their place. We should have more balance, and we will see what can be done. But we will do it calmly and coolly, with the whole football family.\"</p> <p>Setting out his vision for the year ahead before yesterday's Champions League draw, Platini said Uefa is also to ask the European commission to formally ban the international transfer between clubs of players before they are 18. Protection of minors has become one of Platini's prime campaigns; it is aimed at preventing what he has called the \"trafficking and exploitation\" of hopeful youngsters from Africa and developing countries, and at stopping the top clubs poaching players from other clubs' academies. Again, this is perceived to be aimed partly at English clubs, which have been signing players from young ages; now Uefa is to ask the commission to sanction an outright ban.</p> <p>Warming to his theme of \"protecting football\" and stamping out \"cheating\", Platini set out his proposal to increase the number of match officials to five, with two more assistant referees to police the penalty areas. The former France captain admitted, 30 years on, to having cheated by \"simulation\" - diving - in two matches in his career, and said he was able to win penalties because the referee was so far away. \"There is so much a referee cannot see,\" he said. \"I am against technology, video replays, but with two more assistant referees it will deter cheating in the penalty area.\"</p> <p>The five referees idea would, he added, also enable the officials to better judge whether a ball had gone over the goalline. The idea would be applied only to televised matches, where the stakes are higher and the referees subject to more public scrutiny.</p> <p>In a wide-ranging commentary on the issues facing football and how his newly confident and united European governing body intends to tackle them, Platini was forthright about Cristiano Ronaldo, whom he said was right to have stayed at Manchester United. \"When you have signed a contract you don't break it,\" he said, \"so Ronaldo did the right thing. Modern football is apparently about not respecting contracts and trying to make as much money as possible. That's a pity.\"</p>",
  "<p>A boy born in leafy Hampstead today can expect to live 11 years longer than a boy born a few miles away in St Pancras; boys born in parts of India will live longer than those born in parts of Glasgow. The nation's health keeps getting better, but the health gap between rich and poor keeps on getting worse. It is not that the government is doing nothing, but it may not be doing enough, or doing it in the right way.</p> <p>Yesterday's report from the World Health Organisation brings a global dimension to the influence of social factors on health. It was the inspiration of Professor Sir Michael Marmot. It is because of his work that we know so much about how bad things are here; he also advises the Department of Health on how to improve them. Through his efforts we are beginning to understand, as yesterday's report illustrated, that beyond a certain basic level, it is not absolute poverty but inequality that poses the biggest threat to good health. Some very poor places - Kerala or Cuba, for instance - have better health than some rich but unequal ones. We know now that people do not only die of coronary heart disease because of a failure on the part of their local hospital. Such deaths reflect unhealthy lifestyles, and unhealthy lifestyles are often connected to poor education, bad housing, low-paid work and the low self-esteem that accompany them. The many facets of hardship take a more direct toll on vitality too. That makes closing the gap a more complex challenge than building more hospitals or training more doctors, or - as the Conservative health spokesman Andrew Lansley has been suggesting this week - telling obese people there is no excuse.</p> <p>The Marmot solution is a new focus on health right across the public and private sector. If Dar es Salaam can have a healthy city programme, so can every town and village in the UK. Fair access to clean environments and clean jobs, to good housing and good schools are all part of achieving the ideal embodied in free healthcare. This government can argue that is tackling all of the above. It can be proud of the progress made in improving overall health to the extent that life expectancy for the poorest has reached the average of just eight years ago. But the wealthiest are better equipped to take up health initiatives (stopping smoking, eating more healthily), and they get healthier quicker. The gap remains. </p> <p>Meeting the target of reducing it by 2010 looks a distant hope. The survival of the NHS is a symbol of the country's support for fair access to health. But unless access to the good life is shared more fairly, equal access to good health will be denied. Closing the health gap, all the evidence suggests, depends on narrowing the wealth gap.</p>",
  "<p>Something shattered when the Georgian artillery opened up with a massive barrage on Tskhinvali on August 7 (Colonel Arsen Tsukhishvili, chief of staff of the Artillery Brigade said with pride that 300 of his gun barrels fired at the enemy simultaneously). What broke was not only the columns of Russian tanks the Georgian artillery was aiming at. It was a 16-year post-Soviet consensus about the power of Russia to affect the course taken by its neighbours. The cold, unspoken western calculation was that, the quicker we pushed eastwards with a combination of political, oil and military projects, the less Russia could resist. Even an economically resurgent Russia was still judged to be either too weak, too poor or just too ramshackle to stop it.</p> <p>To claim, as David Miliband did yesterday, that Nato did not have a sphere of influence and that the eastern expansion of the military alliance was merely an expression of individual democracies exercising their new-found sovereignty, was breathtakingly disingenuous. In May, a subcommittee of the Nato Parliamentary Assembly, a body that brings together parliamentarians from Nato members and its partners visited Romania and Bulgaria, two of the six states along the Black Sea and the latest members of Nato. The topics discussed on this visit strayed far from its brief - energy and environmental security. The committee heard how Romania and Bulgaria occupy a strategic position between Europe, the largest energy consumer, and the oil-producing countries. Two rival oil and gas pipelines, the EU-backed Nabucco pipeline and the South Stream project backed by Russia, arrive here. Talk of oil and gas led seamlessly on to the military role Nato could play in securing this supply. Paragraph 28 of the executive summary of this visit reads: \"Nato has not traditionally played a role in energy security matters ... It can however play a more active role defending energy infrastructure and the flow of oil and gas on the high seas ... Nato might also provide security for infrastructure in energy-producing states facing unrest.\"</p> <p>Nato yesterday brushed aside Russian claims that an naval exercise in the western part of the Black Sea had anything to do with the crisis going on in the eastern shore. The Nato parliamentarian's visit held before the Georgian crisis erupted says otherwise. If this is not a \"sphere of influence\" being constructed and planned by Nato's existing members along Russia's most sensitive border in the South Caucasus and right though Russia's most sensitive sea, what is? </p> <p>The cold war was a nuclear standoff between two military superpowers with mutually opposed economic systems and ideological beliefs. The new period we could be entering lacks many cold war ingredients. Russia is weaker militarily than the Soviet Union was and its reach is not global. It can sell arms to Syria or Iran, but it can no longer restart the revolution in Angola or Cuba. Russia is unashamedly capitalist. But it is also now<strong> </strong>allergically<strong> </strong>anti-western and free to form its own alliances. That was evident in the Russian President Dmitri Medvedev flying eastwards to Tajikistan on Wednesday for a summit with the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, an assembly which includes Russia, China and four former members of the Soviet Union.</p> <p>The way to counter the forces unleashed on August 7 is clear: stop rearranging the furniture on Russia's sensitive southern border; stop militarising the Black Sea; stop pretending that this is only a conflict about loftier goals, a simple struggle between authoritarianism and western liberal democracy. The ethnically driven post-Soviet map is more complex than that. Local conflicts should be kept local. As things stand, everything is being done to widen them out to the regional level. As a result, Russia and Nato are sleepwalking into a confrontation that neither needs, and neither has planned for.</p>",
  "<p>Diageo, the world's biggest alcoholic drinks group, warned yesterday that slowing economies around the globe - particularly in Britain, Ireland and Spain - would drag down operating profits until next summer. </p> <p>The maker of Smirnoff vodka, Johnnie Walker scotch and Guinness stout, said it was planning underlying operating profit growth of 7% to 9% for the year to June 2009. The target was set as Diageo reported operating profit for the year to June 30 of \u00a32.3bn - in line with a targeted increase of 9%. Sales, after local alcohol duties, rose 7% to \u00a38.1bn.</p> <p>The company is forecasting double-digit earnings per share growth for the current year, though this includes an anticipated \u00a360m benefit from a strong dollar and euro against the pound.</p> <p>Chief executive Paul Walsh identified Britain, Ireland and Spain as being the most challenging for Diageo. \"We think that degree of difficulty will continue,\" he added. Despite the woes of the US economy, Walsh insisted North America - Diageo's largest market, accounting for about a third of sales - remained \"robust\" and not as challenging as western Europe.</p> <p>In Britain and Ireland Diageo faces a tough market for its Guinness brand, Britain's third bestselling pub drink. With beer sales volumes falling at almost unprecedented rates, Walsh said flat volumes and a 2% rise in the value of Guinness sales for the year to June was a strong performance.</p> <p>Sales of the stout benefited from a 20% increase in marketing spend, including the award-winning Tipping Point television advert which featured an elaborate domino-style stunt set in an Argentinian village. Some industry insiders have questioned the wisdom of spending heavily on Guinness in declining markets.</p> <p>Walsh suggested Britain was fast heading for a drinks industry where 60% of alcohol sales came through supermarkets and off-licences. Pubs and bars currently account for about half of sales volumes but are losing ground fast. Walsh said the trend towards drinking at home was being echoed through most mature drinks markets around the world. </p> <p>Andrew Morgan, president of Diageo Europe, said the company had been focusing on marketing collaborations with supermarket groups in the UK to take advantage of the shift. \"We have been investing this year particularly behind the 'big four' category leaders we've got: Smirnoff, Bailey's, Bell's and Gordon's. </p> <p>\"We've been working with the retailers to produce a shelf layout and a combination of products that works.\"</p> <p>Despite its trimmed target for operating profit - a move predicted by several analysts - shares in Diageo last night edged up 20.5p to close at \u00a310. The company is seen by many investors as a strong defensive stock, and has weathered previous global economic slumps comparatively well.</p> <p>But last night Philip Morrisey, an analyst at Citigroup, struck a note of caution. \"Our concern is that perceived defensiveness could be tested during the year to June 2009, given a 55% [operating profit] exposure to the 'problem housing market economies' of the US, UK, Spain and Ireland, together with increasing signs of slowing growth in certain emerging markets.\"</p>",
  "<p>For John and Caroline Singleton, the weekly supermarket shop is no longer a routine chore. The aisles and shelves have become a minefield of moral and financial considerations.</p> <p>\"We're both teachers and we have three young children, so money's always tight,\" John says, weighing up the merits and prices of fresh chickens in the vast Morrisons store on Holloway Road in Islington, north London.</p> <p>Today after a brief but heartfelt discussion, the organic chicken, \u00a34.99 a kilo, is put back and a cheaper free range but non-organic bird goes into the trolley. The reason is simple. \"Finances,\" says John. \"We are poorer,\" adds Caroline. \"I don't buy as much organic food as I used to. Simple as that.\"</p> <p>Holloway Road, an economically mixed area , exemplifies the wider <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/29/organic.food\">national battleground over organic foods</a>. This is reflected in the supermarket choice, which in a few hundred metres takes in every consumer bracket from Waitrose, with its array of fresh guinea fowl and organic ducks at \u00a318 each, to Iceland, where a tray of two chickens will set you back \u00a34.</p> <p>Marks &amp; Spencer and Morrisons fill the middle ground. Shoppers in the former, for years the heartland of the affluent food shopper, are also feeling the ethical pinch. Carmel Craig from Walthamstow, north-east London, says she increasingly finds it \"very, very difficult\" to keep her grocery bills low. \"I tend to look at the lower cost, cheaper brands rather than the brands I went for before,\" she says. \"And also, where I used to buy free range and organic foods I tend to steer away from them now.\"</p> <p>Where moral compromises are made, it seems, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/29/organics.food1\">shoppers prefer to sacrifice organic products</a> while still paying extra for free range eggs and poultry.</p> <p>John, 77, living with his wife on a company pension, says: \"We saw the chicken programme some weeks ago on the television and we saw how cruel it is with these battery chickens. And we buy free range eggs as well. But organic is just not worth it for us.\"</p> <p>Others are more resolute. Sara, a local full-time mother, is ushering her two toddlers around the store alongside a trolley packed with organic products.</p> <p>\"I'd be very phobic about having anything other than organic products ... and so I feel it's necessary and something I'm prepared to pay for,\" she says. \"I tend to cut out other things. Food is very fundamental to me.\"</p>",
  "<p>Britain's most senior Asian police officer yesterday directly accused Sir Ian Blair, the Met commissioner, of repeatedly racially discriminating against him.</p> <p>Tarique Ghaffur, an assistant commissioner at Scotland Yard, accused his chief of a catalogue of unfair treatment as the civil war at the top of policing erupted in public. His employment tribunal claim says Blair subjected him to \"degrading and humiliating\" treatment and repeatedly tried to undermine him.</p> <p>The claim was lodged last Friday but the Guardian has learned extensive details. Ghaffur will allege he was: harassed by Blair and another senior officer; repeatedly excluded from crucial meetings and discussions; criticised by a fellow senior officer about his language skills in a way which amounted to racial discrimination; and victimised by the commissioner in a face to face meeting over his decision to bring a discrimination claim.</p> <p>Ghaffur yesterday spoke publicly for the first time since lodging his employment tribunal claim. At a news conference he said he loved the Met and added: \"My case is essentially to do with my treatment at the highest levels of the Met, in particular the discrimination I have been subjected to over a long period by the present commissioner, Sir Ian Blair.\"</p> <p>The Met commissioner has talked of having a \"long, honourable and occasionally blood-stained record on the championing of diversity\". In his employment tribunal claim, Ghaffur repeatedly contradicts that assertion.</p> <p>Only hours after Ghaffur spoke, the Met denied the claims and urged him to \"shut up\" and get on with his job. Deputy Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson said the force did not think the tribunal was necessary and would \"robustly challenge\" the allegations, which are also aimed at Deputy Assistant Commissioner Richard Bryant.</p> <p>The tribunal will see the Metropolitan police again challenged to defend itself against claims of racism. Sitting alongside Ghaffur, Alfred John, chairman of the Met's Black Police Association, repeated charges of institutional and individual racism in the force.</p> <p>Ghaffur claims he was undermined as head of central operations, with his opinion being ignored on key issues and appointments made without him being consulted. He claims his subordinates reported directly to Blair on key issues, thus undermining his authority.</p> <p>The 53-year-old officer is suing on three fronts: race, religion and age. He blames the commissioner over a decision to renew his contract of employment by one year, rather than the three he wanted.</p> <p>The decision was made by the Metropolitan police authority but Ghaffur says it was swayed by an intervention by Blair. In his claim, he cites a white officer who was given a longer extension.</p> <p>The longest section of the claim relates to Ghaffur's role running the Met's input into security for the 2012 London Olympics. He claims Blair and Bryant discriminated against him.</p> <p>Ghaffur says this was despite a government report on the work he had done on Olympic security praising him and another official review hailing his \"visible leadership\". He claims his duties were reduced, and he was excluded from key meetings. Ghaffur even alleges that important documents relating to Olympic security were kept from him.</p> <p>His employment tribunal claim says both Blair and Bryant harassed him and their actions had the \"effect of creating a degrading and humiliating environment\" for the Asian officer.</p> <p>Ghaffur alleges the commissioner victimised him for preparing to bring a racial discrimination claim, an allegation that if proven could add to any damages he receives from a tribunal. He says he was summoned to a face to face meeting with Blair last month and told he would be removed from his role at the top of the Met if he continued with his legal action.</p> <p>Ghaffur says in his claim that the discrimination goes back to 2000, when Blair was the deputy commissioner and in charge of the corruption unit which investigated a high-flying Asian officer to whom Ghaffur was a mentor.</p> <p>The claim says Ghaffur was subjected to covert surveillance and was the only senior officer excluded from meetings about that corruption investigation. He claims this sent out the message to his senior colleagues that he could not be trusted and unfairly placed his integrity in doubt.</p> <p>He also says that in one incident a senior officer used what amounted to racist remarks, saying that Ghaffur could not be understood when he spoke.</p> <p>At his news conference, Ghaffur's lawyer, Shahrokh Mireskandari, said Blair's fitness to continue as commissioner would hinge on the outcome of the case. </p> <p>Senior Yard sources say the force's leadership are \"furious\" at Ghaffur over the way he has conducted himself, a sentiment reflected in Stephenson's statement: \"In short, I think it is long past time we shut up, stop making public statements about a private dispute and get on with the job we are paid to do. </p> <p>\"I do not think it was appropriate for this matter to be conducted in such a public way.\"</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron has \"touched a nerve\" with the British people as the Tories exploit a \"big gap\" in Labour's performance after 11 years in power, a government minister has warned.</p> <p>In a candid assessment of Labour's prospects, as Gordon Brown prepares to return to the political fray next week, skills minister David Lammy calls on the Labour party to do more to \"refresh our core story\" and expose Tory weaknesses.</p> <p>Lammy writes in the September edition of Progress, the Blairite magazine: \"The truth is that the Tories' change in language has touched a nerve, reflecting a big gap in our own political narrative. Yet beneath Cameron's rhetoric lies the basic philosophy that failed Britain in the past. The Tories demand responsibility without offering support; they appeal for fraternity without any real belief in equality; they have finally noticed 'society,' but remain implacably hostile to the state.\"</p> <p>According to Lammy, Labour needs to learn from the Tories and avoid becoming part of the establishment, a mistake made by former London mayor Ken Livingstone, who was beaten by Boris Johnson after being seen as the incumbency candidate.</p> <p>\"The political language deployed by the opposition should also prompt us in the Labour party to refresh our core story after 11 years in government,\" he writes. \"The danger is that we spend too much time emphasising what works - and not enough making the case for what matters. This is a trap all governing parties face: even Ken Livingstone, the archetypal insurgent, became weighed down by incumbency in seeking a third term in office.\"</p> <p>Lammy's intervention comes as the main political parties prepare for an intense runup to the conference season. The prime minister will announce a series of initiatives in the coming weeks to help less well-off people - most notably with fuel bills - who are being hit by the global economic downturn.</p> <p>Brown is not planning a one-off economic relaunch. Such an initiative would imply that he has embarked on the wrong course up until now and it would undermine his claim that Britain faces a long slog - with the emphasis on long-term solutions such as the development of renewable enery sources - before it can move on from the downturn.</p> <p>Brown's plans may be complicated by a byelection in his neighbouring Fife constituency of Glenrothes, a once safe Labour seat, which the SNP is tipped to win. But Labour sources in Scotland are hopeful that they may avoid a humiliation by selecting the respected headmaster of the prime minister's old Fife school as the party's candidate.</p> <p>Lindsay Roy, the head of Kirkcaldy high school, who has emerged as the front-runner to become Labour's candidate, is a personal friend of the prime minister. He is highly regarded in the local community and seen as a more difficult target for the SNP to attack than any of the other possible local candidates.</p> <p>A loss in Glenrothes, where Labour holds a majority of 10,664, would embolden ministerial critics of the prime minister who decided after the byelection losses in Crewe and Glasgow East that Brown is not a winner. But they will not contemplate moving against him unless Labour is still facing dire poll ratings when parliament returns on October 6.</p> <p>In this climate, the prime minister is facing pressure from Labour and the unions to help people struggling with rising fuel bills by imposing a windfall tax on energy companies. This was dismissed yesterday by John Hutton, the business secretary.</p> <p>But Lammy makes clear in his article that Labour needs to tack to the left. \"The next agenda must be forged through starting with the pressures and the struggles that people face in their own lives ... At its most basic, this means a clearer story about two things: the limits of the market and the new frontiers of the welfare state. Old Labour was hostile to the market; New Labour has arguably been too deferential to it.\"</p>",
  "<p>Organic food sales have fallen more than at any time in the last decade as shoppers try to cut costs and experts warn that consumers are more confused than ever about whether it is worth paying the higher prices.</p> <p>Figures collected for the Guardian by the market research company TNS show spending on organic food and drinks fell from a peak of nearly \u00a3100m a month earlier this year to \u00a381m in the most recent four-week period recorded. The fall has been steepest in eggs, but is also reported in the most popular sectors, including dairy, fruit and vegetables and chicken.</p> <p>Some <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/29/organic.food\">farmers are quitting organic production</a> to cut costs and others appear to be delaying meeting the standards necessary to enter the market - leading to concerns that it could take longer to build up sales when demand recovers.</p> <p>The figures will be seized on as further evidence of the pressure on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/29/organics.food\">consumers struggling to balance household budgets</a>, and will raise questions about how willing people are to pay for higher environmental and other ethical benefits.</p> <p>\"We're certainly seeing a dip, the question is: is [it] a dip that's bouncing back again or it could be the start of a real drop,\" said Edward Garner, of TNS.</p> <p>The National Farmers Union said members had reported falling demand, particularly in organic eggs and chicken.</p> <p>\"I was talking to somebody in the NFU [and] they were saying it's happening in beef and everywhere because at the end of the day it's a nice-to-have, not a need-to-have,\" said Charles Bourns, chairman of the NFU's poultry board.</p> <p>The Soil Association, the organic industry lobby group, said its figures, which are dominated by smaller producers, showed some decline, not a dramatic fall, but admitted that there were worries about whether people would renew home box deliveries when they return from summer holidays. </p> <p>\"I predict [demand] will plateau a bit but not decline,\" said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/29/organics.food\">Helen Browning</a>, the association's director of food and farming, who said she believed most organic buyers would stay loyal and top quality producers should not be affected. </p> <p>\"These values are important to people still - the concern about the way we farm, the way the countryside is under threat at times, about animal welfare,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>Before the big guns started firing this week in Denver, by far the most successful speech to the Democratic National Convention <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/7755162\">came from governor Brian Schweitzer</a> of Montana, which has become a shining example of energy innovation. He found a novel way of bringing the Pepsi Centre to its feet by calling on them, section by section, to \"stand up for American energy independence\". They did so with enthusiasm, since the message that the folksy governor delivered is absolutely central to <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5h6N9ikKCqKXMvMEerr4XJCrUM8MAD92CFS880\">Barack Obama's programme</a> - that the US must become energy self-sufficient by 2020.</p> <p>This is to be achieved by a massive programme of investment in renewable energy and other low-carbon technologies, by transforming the US vehicle industry away from dependence on oil-based fuels and by promoting an a belief in energy efficiency that could scarcely be more counter-cultural to the most energy-profligate society on the face of the earth.</p> <p>The basic message that is repeatedly heard from the Obama campaign is that the US has 3% of the world's oil reserves but consumes 25% of the world's oil - and that things can't go on like that. One would have thought it difficult to disagree, while marvelling at the fact that it has taken so long for this basic premise to reach political prominence.</p> <p>The fact that it has done so in this election year owes less to concern for the welfare of the planet, though to be fair this is quite strong among Democrat delegates, than to two politically-charged pieces of self-interest. The first lies in the fact that Americans are now being asked to pay around 50 pence a litre to fill their vehicles - a monstrous imposition which challenges the God-given right to waste as much fuel as they like. The second ties into the realisation that their oil-dependence is upon some of the dodgiest regimes in the world with American petro-dollars being used to fund a variety of evil empires.</p> <p>Rationally, the Democrats should be the clear beneficiaries from this emergence of energy as a top-flight election issue, alongside healthcare and jobs. They can point to the Republicans' <a href=\"http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Investing/JubaksJournal/BigOils10FavoriteMembersOfCongress.aspx\">close relationships with big oil</a> and to the abject failure of the Bush administration to take the energy challenges even semi-seriously until far too late in the day.</p> <p>Eight years ago, it was a standard element of George Bush's stump speech to mock Al Gore's talk of solar power and wind farms as key elements in future American energy power. One of the early, shameful acts of the Bush administration was to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2001/mar/29/globalwarming.usnews\">walk away from the Kyoto Treaty</a> on the grounds that nobody was going to tell America how to run its affairs or lessen its dependence on the black stuff, even if it did have to be shipped from the four corners of the earth. The Bush administration's record should be an easy target.</p> <p>But nothing is that straightforward. While the American public is now more aware of the symptoms of the problem, it is by no means clear that they are as united in embracing the solutions - particularly if these involve radical adjustments to the way they live.</p> <p>In these circumstances, it is tempting to look for simpler messages that essentially offer pain-free relief from the ailment. And that, in contrast to the Obama campaign, is exactly what John McCain and the Republicans are offering them, with considerable initial success. Indeed, the narrowing gap in the polls over recent weeks has been attributed in significant part to the energy issue.</p> <p>The McCain message is that solutions will be delivered by the market if only the market is given the freedom to get on with it. American technology will come up with the answers because it will be profitable to do so. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/19/us/politics/19nuke.html\">Nuclear power</a>, as well as a nod in the direction of renewables, will deliver low-carbon outcomes.</p> <p><a href=\"http://blog.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/06/18/mccain_touts_clean_coal_and_nu.html\">Clean coal technology</a> will be the other cornerstone of US energy generation long into the future. And, crucially, the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/16/AR2008061602731_pf.html\">prohibitions on drilling offshore for oil</a> will be removed in order to allow the companies to get on with the work, which will increase self-sufficiency.</p> <p>It is on the last of these that the Democrats are most vulnerable, since it is the price of fuel rather than the environment that has emerged as the voters' main source of interest in this debate. And it is an easily understandable (if highly misleading) message that America could be producing more oil if only Democratic politicians would stop imposing unreasonable obstructions.</p> <p>In truth, the offshore resources would not fundamentally alter the argument, but it is beguiling nonetheless - so much so that Obama has been obliged to soften his opposition to offshore drilling. He now says that he would bargain some concessions to the oil companies in return for their commitment on renewables. The Republicans smell blood and simply up the ante, insisting that the waters off California - where opposition to offshore drilling is strongest - must be opened up for exploration. </p> <p>In truth, it is difficult from a UK perspective to see why a ban on offshore drilling has become such an environmental holy grail. The North Sea, for all the harshness of the conditions that the industry operates in, has been an environmental success story, and technology has progressed a long way since either it or the Gulf of Mexico were developed as major oil fields.</p> <p>But the absolute certainty is that there are a lot more motorists than there are environmentalists who care deeply about a ban on offshore drilling, and that is a reality that McCain has tapped into very effectively. Obama has also been obliged to slip the word \"nuclear\" into his script of potential solutions in recent weeks. While he was never actually opposed to nuclear power, it was simply ignored in his earlier pronouncements.</p> <p>McCain has also been obliged to make adjustments to his policy in line with the clamour for \"American energy independence\". In particular, he was an outspoken opponent of using crops to create bioethanol and biodiesel as substitutes for fossil-based fuels. This went down like a lead balloon in Iowa, where the candidate nomination process began and where farmers want the far higher earnings that fuel crops can bring them. So McCain now presents himself as a <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2006/11/13/8393132/?postversion=2006103111\">reluctant convert</a>, though for economic and energy security reasons rather than environmental ones.</p> <p>And that is indeed the lesson that is emerging from the US political process and will be equally applicable in the UK - at a time of economic difficulty for average families, environmental altruism tends to go out the window to be replaced by financial self-interest. Any attempt to promote a low-carbon energy policy in current conditions cannot ignore that fact.</p> <p>The Democrats are now trying hard to adjust to it. Hillary Clinton spoke this week about their objective of American energy independence having the potential to create five million \"green collar jobs\" over the next decade - a nice phrase that I hadn't heard before and also one that the voters can relate to. A similar linkage between jobs and a low-carbon energy policy could be made in the UK but requires a level of joined-up government, which is lamentably absent at present. Maybe we need a governor Schweitzer to inspire us about the case for UK energy independence and what we can get out of it economically as well as environmentally.</p>",
  "<p>Children who receive a rich variety of home learning before they start school achieve measurably better results in maths tests at age 10, according to a major government-funded study into childhood learning.</p> <p>The researchers said the benefits of reading to a child, playing with numbers and shapes, teaching them nursery rhymes and taking them to the library are detectable on top of the influence of their parents' wealth and level of education.</p> <p>The study also found that children who attend quality preschool education do better at age 10. Previous results from the same study heavily influenced the government's decision to put into law in 2004 a requirement for local authorities to provide basic preschool education for 3 to 4 year olds. But the researchers said that more work needs to be done to improve the quality of that provision.</p> <p>Prof Edward Melhuish at Birkbeck, University of London, who led the research said the results showed that a combination of a good home learning environment, good preschool education and a good primary school were all important for later results. He said that without these benefits an average child from a poor background would be in the bottom 20% at school, but with all three advantages it would on average move into the top 20%.</p> <p>The Effective Provision of Pre-School Education Project has also shown the importance of home learning. \"There are plenty of mothers who aren't very well educated who provide a great home environment and conversely some highly educated parents who don't provide such a good home environment,\" he said.</p> <p>\"What parents do is important irrespective of their own education,\" added co-author Prof Pam Sammons at the University of Nottingham, \"it's not just middle class children who do lots of reading.\"</p> <p>The study followed nearly 3000 children at over 800 primary schools from age 3 onwards. The team collected detailed information about the schools they attended, their socioeconomic background and their home environment. It is the largest study to look in such detail at the educational development of children in the general population. The new analysis, which is published in Science, focused on achievement in maths tests at age 10.</p> <p>\"The preschool experiences both at home and in the preschool itself had consequences for longer term development in maths achievement age 10,\" said Melhuish, \"This is the first study which demonstrates preschool effects that are long term in nature for the general population.\" Previously, some researchers believed that the benefits of preschool education were much more short-lived.</p> <p>Melhuish said the study strongly points to a need for universal high-quality preschool education. \"Clearly if you want to maximise the achievement of your population you should provide a high level of preschool education.\" He said that the Chinese government in particular had realised this and were investing heavily in preschool education. \"The politburo in China are not doing this for the love of the little kiddies. They are doing this because they recognise that it is an essential part of the infrastructure for a successful economy in the modern world.\"</p>",

  "<p>The headteacher of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordonbrown\">Gordon Brown</a>'s old secondary school in Fife has emerged as the front-runner to become <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">Labour</a>'s candidate for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/glenrothes\">Glenrothes byelection</a>. </p> <p>Lindsay Roy, the head of Kirkcaldy high school, is regarded by senior figures in the local Labour party as a powerful candidate and the most likely to prevent the Scottish National party from humiliating Brown by winning the once-safe Labour seat next to his own constituency. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/snp\">SNP</a> is currently favourite to win Glenrothes, which borders Brown's seat of Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath, after the party overturned Labour's 13,500-vote majority in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/glasgoweast\">Glasgow East</a> last month. </p> <p>Some observers believe a nationalist victory in Fife would fatally damage Brown's premiership.</p> <p>Roy, a friend of the prime minister for 18 years, confirmed to the Guardian today he was putting himself forward as a candidate at next Monday night's selection meeting, but denied speculation that Brown had personally asked him to stand. </p> <p>He indicated, however, that the prime minister had indirectly urged him to volunteer. It is believed Brown used an intermediary such as Alex Rowley, the Labour group leader on Fife council, a former general secretary of the Scottish Labour party and Brown's closest ally in Fife. </p> <p>\"I have been asked by the people of my community and people in the Labour party in my community to consider standing. There has been no direct approach from Gordon Brown,\" Roy said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Tory leader, David Cameron, challenged the prime minister to campaign in person in Glenrothes, as the Scottish Tory party announced it had selected Maurice Golden, who contested the Holyrood seat of Central Fife last year and is environment campaigns manager for Keep Scotland Beautiful, as its candidate. </p> <p>\"I hope that Gordon Brown will rise to the challenge of campaigning in his own back yard so that the voters can see for themselves the choices on offer,\" Cameron said. \"It is time for him to stop running scared and to stand up and be counted. I will be in Glenrothes. Will he?\" </p> <p>There had been speculation since the death of the sitting Labour MP, John MacDougall, earlier this month that party officials were trying to persuade Henry McLeish, the former Scottish first minister and former local Labour MP, to stand. </p> <p>But there were significant doubts that Brown wanted McLeish to stand and <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/19/glenrothes.scotland1\">McLeish has since ruled himself out</a>, leaving Labour facing the difficult task of finding a candidate strong enough to counter the SNP's popularity in Fife. </p> <p>While several well respected local councillors and MSPs have been mentioned, senior Labour figures doubted whether they had the right calibre for the contest or would be vulnerable to SNP attacks on Labour's record in government.</p> <p>Roy was brought in as a \"troubleshooter\" to run Kirkcaldy high school by the SNP-led council in May after the school was criticised by the school inspectorate for its poor exam results, indiscipline and low staff morale. The secondary school has also been the focus of an anti-knives campaign and has its own dedicated police officer.</p> <p>Labour sources said today that Roy had addressed staff at the school yesterday to tell them he expected to be nominated for the seat. </p> <p>A Labour party member said to have a strong base in the constituency, Roy was made a CBE for his services to education in 2004. He is also a lay inspector for HM inspectorate of education in Scotland. </p> <p>His last school, Inverkeithing High, received a glowing report from the inspectors.</p> <p>One senior source who once worked with Roy said he had \"formidable energy\" and was known to get to his desk at 6am, working for up to 15 hours a day. \"His commitment is absolutely unbelievable,\" he said. \"I think he would make a very, very good candidate. I think he will turn it.\"</p> <p>Brown praised the school when he became prime minister last year, citing its one-time school motto \u2013 \"I will do my utmost\" \u2013 and stating: \"I wouldn't be standing here without the opportunities I got there.\"</p> <p>Brown was fast-tracked at the school, which was close to his father's church, by being put in classes a year ahead of his age group \u2013 a decision Brown which later said he regretted because it took away from his immediate peers.</p> <p>The local party is expected to choose Labour's candidate on Monday and if he is selected, Roy will face Peter Grant, currently the SNP leader of Fife council. Although he would defend a 10,664 vote majority, he faces a tough task. </p> <p>Since it became clear that John MacDougall was suffering from terminal cancer, the SNP has been quietly very active in the constituency preparing for the byelection. </p> <p>After winning the comparable seat at Holyrood and taking control of Fife council in the Scottish elections last year, the SNP is still clear favourite to win. A number of opinion polls this year give the SNP a clear lead over Labour, in both Holyrood and Westminster votes.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrats have selected Harry Wills, a local businessman. The party hope to repeat their shock victory in the Dunfermline and West Fife byelection in 2006, when Willie Rennie overcame a 11,562 majority for Labour.</p>",
  "<p>Demos, the influential thinktank closely linked to New Labour, has decided not to hold debates or events at any of the annual party conferences this year.</p> <p>The move has raised questions about the organisation's future plans, since the conferences are the traditional showcase for thinktanks' research and a chance to demonstrate their political influence.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2638444/Demos-architect-of-Cool-Britannia-denies-financial-problems.html\">Peter Harrington, a spokesman for Demos, told the website of the Daily Telegraph</a> that the decision to avoid the party conferences had been taken because the annual gatherings had become \"too stifling and enclosed\" for healthy political debate.</p> <p>Insisting that the move was not motivated by money, he said: \"Yes, the financial environment is difficult, but everyone is in a more difficult financial environment. We have a huge range of funders and we are working on w wide range of projects.\"</p> <p>Demos was established in 1993, the year before Tony Blair became Labour leader, and the thinktank became closely identified with the \"New Labour\" project.</p> <p>Several of its researchers and its first director, Geoff Mulgan, later worked in No 10 during Blair's administration. But with his departure Demos's connections with Labour loosened.</p> <p>Many thinktanks fund research projects with donations from corporate sponsors, but with Labour's slide in the polls, donors may prefer to put their money into groups which will have influence with David Cameron instead.</p> <p>Demos said it remains in good health, pointing to the appointment of Richard Reeves, the political author, as its new director.</p>",
  "<p>Channel 4 has created what it hopes will be an online home for the UK's animation community, rolling out an advertising-supported, YouTube-style site that will pay animators for their work.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.4mations.tv/\">4mations.tv</a> has been in development for two years and launched in a trial form this week with 200 animations from Channel 4's extensive archive. Amateur animators are also invited to upload their own work.</p> <p>The project is a collaboration with Aardman, the Bristol-based independent producer behind Wallace and Gromit, and the animation specialists Lupus Films.</p> <p>4mations includes comedy, adult, sci-fi and 3D work along with games and specialist groups. Users can vote on clips, upload their own work and embed their favourite clips on their own websites and social networks. </p> <p>Channel 4's new media commissioner for factual, Adam Gee, said the site would provide a new focus for the broadcaster's animation output.</p> <p>The broadcaster has a strong tradition in animation going back to its launch in 1982. Channel 4 animations have included Raymond Briggs' classic The Snowman in 1982, Suzie Templeton's Peter &amp; the Wolf, and Taking a Line for a Walk, based on the work of artist Paul Klee.</p> <p>\"We're really hoping this will be the home for Channel 4 animation for the next 25 years,\" said Gee.</p> <p>\"We have a terrific track record and have really powered animation in the UK, but there is increasing pressure on scheduling pushing shows later into the night and it's harder to find slots for it,\" he added.</p> <p>\"This is a place for the archive and new material to come together with a base for Channel 4's Talent schemes - and also setting out a place and platform for all the animations in the UK.\"</p> <p>Gee said he has been developing international partnerships for the project in India, Canada and China that will emphasise that the site is \"outward-looking, globally orientated\" and wants to \"carve out its own niche\" in the global animation market.</p> <p>Animators will receive cash rewards of up to \u00a31,000 per month for the most popular videos over the next six months, while any revenues Channel 4 earns through display advertising will be reinvested in the site, Gee added.</p> <p>The project is the result of a six-figure investment by Channel 4 and has taken a significant amount of work in clearing the international rights for all the clips on the site.</p> <p>4mations, which has been the brainchild of arts commissioning editor Jan Younghusband, has characteristically quirky branding which includes kittens, skulls and laser beams - and was based on a theme of \"Monty Python for the 21st century\".</p> <p>The full version launches on September 15 and will include Thinks, a simple editing tool that will let users create their own animation in less than an hour. </p> <p>4mations also fits with elements of the new diploma in creative and media for 14- to 19-year-olds, who will contribute several thousand animations to the site.</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p>That Clinton fellow is such an enigmatic figure. Just last week he was subtly dissing Obama, saying there wasn't much difference between Obama's and McCain's global warming plans. Last night he gives a speech that wildly exceed people's expectations. He'll probably throw one or two little javelins Obama's way this fall; it's his nature. But after last night one can now picture them being partners and friends some day -- Clinton declared that he now sees Obama as his heir, not as the youthful usurper of whom he's jealous.</p> <p>I was also glad that <em>someone </em>finally mentioned the Constitution of the United States, which has been raped serially these last eight years.

  "<p>For over 60 years the <a href=\"http://www.nationalgalleries.org/\"> National Galleries of Scotland</a> has had the privilege of housing the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/28/art?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=commentisfree\">Bridgewater loan</a>, arguably the finest private collection of old master paintings on loan to any museum or gallery in the world. But the honour of showing some of the greatest masterpieces from the story of western art has also had a worrying side. For many decades we have known that, at some point, the galleries would face the prospect of trying to find a way to bring these superlative works of art into permanent public ownership. </p> <p>Working closely with an owner of the collection, the Duke of Sutherland, who is <a href=\"http://news.scotsman.com/latestnews/-Threat-to-Scotland39s-greatest.4433947.jp\">committed to the idea</a> of the paintings remaining on public view, we have constructed a deal which would not only bring two incomparable masterpieces into the national collection for ever, but also secure the future of the Bridgewater loan for another generation. For the first time, the national galleries in Edinburgh and London would work together in partnership; the sums involved are formidable but, seen in the context of international art market and the overall value of this collection, they are extremely generous. We will not have a better chance to address an issue that has been a major concern since this collection first went on view in London at the beginning of the 19th century. </p> <p>There may be some who will <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/aug/28/art\">question the need</a> to spend significant sums of public and private money on great works of art. There may be others who will question why, in this global age, we must make every effort to keep these treasures in Great Britain. The answer to these questions can best be answered by the countless numbers of artists, students, art-lovers and ordinary members of the public who have come to admire and love these works that lie at the very heart of the National Galleries of Scotland. And a decisive intervention now will be paid off many times over in the inspiration, education and imagination of future generations.</p> <p><em>John Leighton is director general of the National Galleries of Scotland</em></p>",

  "<p>Analysts were divided over the health of the US economy after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/28/useconomicgrowth.useconomy\">second-quarter GDP was revised more than expected</a> today.</p> <p><strong>James O'Sullivan at UBS Securities</strong> expressed caution over the growth numbers: \"We continue to see hard-to-believe GDP numbers. Other broad measures of output do not show this kind of strength; they are running a lot weaker than the GDP figure. This number seems to overstate the underlying strength even though exports are obviously strong.\"</p> <p>However, <strong>Marc Pado at Cantor Fitzgerald &amp; Co</strong> was more optimistic about the future of the US economy: \"I think this bodes well. GDP continues to build the bull case that we've been too pessimistic and the outlook for the fourth quarter has been played down so much that if gasoline prices at the pump stay below $4 a gallon, you build the case for a big, positive upside surprise.\"</p> <p><strong>Michael Englund at Action Economics</strong> agreed: \"I think what it does mean is that some of the highly confident assertions about where the economy was going in February, March and April proved to be completely wrong. I think it's clear that the second quarter not only wasn't a recession quarter, it was actually a very robust quarter.\"</p> <p><strong>Dustin Reid at ABN Amro</strong> said the numbers suggested the US would continue to enjoy strong growth for the rest of the year: \"The US economy in general is performing at a better level than what people probably expected two or three months ago and the US has the potential to lead global growth in the second half of the year.\"</p> <p><strong>Jim Awad at WP Stewart &amp; Co</strong> was also confident: \"The market is gaining increasing confidence; the strain in the financial markets and high oil prices will not tip the economy into a recession.\"</p> <p>But <strong>Gary Pollack at Deutsche Bank</strong> said there was still a great deal of uncertainty: \"The outlook for the economy is still bleak as consumer confidence remains low and the housing market is still grinding lower. The outlook for third-quarter GDP is less than 1%, so I still have a negative outlook.\"</p>",
  "<p>\"History will judge!\" were the bullish words of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Kouchner\">Bernard Kouchner</a>, the French foreign minister, in response to <a href=\"http://www.russiaprofile.org/author_biography.php?author=Konstantin+Kosachev\">Konstantin Kosachev</a>, president of the Russian Duma foreign affairs committee, who warned that \"You are absolutely wrong on Kosovo. It is a terrible precedent\", during a press conference earlier this year following Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence. With Dmitry Medvedev, the Russian president, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/26/russia.georgia1\">signing a decree</a> on the independence of Georgia's break-away provinces of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, the judgments of history are likely to be delivered far sooner than Kouchner and others expected. </p> <p>By relying upon reiterations of \"uniqueness\" to justify their recognition of Kosovo's independence, the US and a majority of EU member states have ensured that appeals to respect the territorial integrity of Georgia sound both hollow and hypocritical, particularly President Bush's <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-08-26-Russia-Georgia_N.htm?csp=23&amp;RM_Exclude=aol\">insistence</a> that \"Georgia's territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nation's, including Russia's\". An international system defined by such arbitrary reiterations of \"uniqueness\", as opposed to universal principles, is always going to be vulnerable to contrived acts of imitation. The miscalculation of Kosovo is now, with conscious Russian assistance, recoiling back onto its instigators.</p> <p>In collapsing the distinction between international law and politics, those who supported Kosovo's independence have opened up a Pandora's box of mutual recognitions and assertions of sovereignty, with damaging repercussions for both regional and global security. By discarding the ideas of compromise, accommodation and reintegration, support for dividing Serbia as a solution to ethno-national conflicts was both myopic and ill-conceived. Further reiterations of the inevitability of, and lack of alternatives to, independence for Kosovo constrained discussion over the possibility and nature of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jan/21/thereisanotherway\">other potential solutions</a>, including innovations in sovereignty and autonomy in line with UN security council <a href=\"http://www.nato.int/Kosovo/docu/u990610a.htm\">resolution 1244</a>.</p> <p>The new recognition game of international politics is unlikely to end here, with the aspirations of local ethnic majorities elsewhere fuelled by the Kosovo case. Secessionist movements within and beyond the EU's borders continue to insist that Kosovo is a model for their own respective causes. In the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/mar/17/afterkosovothedeluge\">former Soviet Union</a>, for instance, Armenian and Azerbaijani forces have clashed over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, whilst the Moldovan province of Trans-Dniester continues to seek recognition as an independent state. </p> <p>Kouchner's <a href=\"http://www.kosovocompromise.com/cms/item/analysis/en.html?view=story&amp;id=1203&amp;sectionId=2\">assertion</a> that \"when two communities cannot speak to each other, but they only speak through arms, there is no choice but to separate them\" is not only blind to Europe's very own history, principles and practices, but also to efforts to build peaceful co-existence throughout the <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/26/serbia.georgia\">western Balkans</a>. The recognition of Kosovo's independence has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/feb/19/theendofmultilateralism\">contributed</a> to the further erosion of two of the fundamental pillars of the international system \u2013 sovereign equality and the principle of the inviolability of borders. The resulting recognition games and \"parades of sovereignty\" will have a number of destabilising effects throughout the world. Only through a UN framework and respect for international law can progress be made towards a model of multilateral governance to contend with the challenges of the 21st century.</p>",
  "<p>Fears that the US is falling into recession were dispelled, at least temporarily, today when second-quarter growth for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">world's largest economy</a> was revised to a higher rate than previously recorded.</p> <p>Government data showed that the economy expanded by an annualised rate of 3.3% in the three months to June due to robust consumer spending and net exports. This was much higher than the 1.9% pace that was first reported and the fastest rate in nearly a year. Wall Street had been expecting an upward revision, but only to 2.7%.</p> <p>The figures are likely to quell some concerns that the US would go into recession this year, although analysts are still split over the prospects for the country's economy.</p> <p>\"The market is gaining increasing confidence that the strain in the financial markets and high oil prices will not tip the economy into a recession,\" said Jim Awad at WP Steward &amp; Co.</p> <p>The upward revision was cheered by Wall Street, with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining 101 points to 11604 in early trading.</p> <p>While many economists are still expecting growth to taper off slightly in the second half of the year, today's revision contrasts with the sluggish, almost flat growth in the first quarter after a 0.2% contraction in the final three months of 2007. This was the weakest rate since 2001 when the US was last in recession and sparked predictions that the economy was set for a similar fate this year as well.</p> <p>Most of the increased growth came from higher overseas demand, rather than domestic strength. Exports grew at a hefty 13.2% annual rate instead of the 9.2% pace initially estimated, as foreign buyers snapped up cheap US goods thanks to a weakened dollar.</p> <p>Meanwhile, consumer spending, which underpins two-thirds of the US economy, grew at an upwardly revised 1.7% annual rate rather than the 1.5% pace first reported, after tax rebates of up to $600 spurred shoppers who had cut back amid the economy's problems.</p> <p>Some experts believe that the US may not be able to skirt recession for much longer.</p> <p>\"The outlook for the economy is still bleak as consumer confidence remains low and the housing market is still grinding lower,\" said Gary Pollack at Deutsche Bank. \"The outlook for third quarter growth is less than 1%, so I still have a negative outlook.\" </p> <p>Exports and consumer spending are likely to taper off in the second half of the year after spending from government stimulus cheques dries up and weakening global growth and a stronger US dollar will probably crimp demand from abroad.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/07/useconomicgrowth.housingmarket\">severe housing slump</a> also continues to weigh on the economy, as seen by the GDP data, which revealed residential construction was down by an annual 15.7% pace. Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke recently warned the economy will be weak through the rest of this year.</p> <p>Separately, investors were cheered by signs of hope from the US labour market after jobless claims for state benefits declined last week to 425,000, the lowest reading for about a month. </p> <p>While it was the third straight week that unemployment benefits have declined, claims still remain above the 400,000 mark - an indicator of a slowing economy.</p> <p>Employers have cut jobs every month this year and wage growth is trailing inflation. That combination also adds to concerns about the future of consumer spending.</p>",
  "<p>Three years after Hurricane Katrina, a more glamorous image of black America is presenting itself to the world in the person of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a>. Meanwhile, in New Orleans, America's story of black urban poverty is still unfolding, largely beneath the radar of the global media.</p> <p>In August and September 2005, areas like the largely black <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Ninth_Ward\">Lower Ninth ward</a>, almost entirely invisible to the hordes of tourists who flock to New Orleans every year, attracted worldwide sympathy <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/27/hurricanekatrina.usa\">as the levees broke</a>. Now they have been all but forgotten. While tourists long ago repopulated the French Quarter, 57% of New Orleans' black population \u2013 against 36% of whites \u2013 have yet to return to the city. Many never will. This is because since Katrina, developers have clubbed together with the authorities to complete New Orleans' makeover into a playground for wealthy tourists.</p> <p>As house prices soar and homelessness rises, the authorities are quietly doing away with the city's remaining stocks of affordable housing in moves that the UN has recently claimed constitute human rights violations. The fact that these demolitions will overwhelmingly affect black people has led some to call this <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2005/sep/24/usnews.hurricanes2005\">ethnic cleansing</a>.</p> <p>Looking back, these developments should come as no surprise. The sympathy that met Katrina's immediate aftermath was short-lived. In August 2005 it was poor African-American residents, statistically the least likely to have the means to evacuate the stricken city, who bore the brunt of the storm damage. Viewers all round the world watched in horrified fascination as conditions in the convention centre and Superbowl deteriorated. News reports did focus on the government's apparent abandonment of its own people, but a hysterical and arguably racist undercurrent was almost compulsively drawn to rumours of rape and murder \u2013 nearly all of which turned out to be untrue.</p> <p>As residents evacuated the city, and before the floodwaters had even receded, the future of New Orleans and its residents was being spoken about in no uncertain terms. \"We finally cleaned up public housing in New Orleans\", declared Republican congressman Richard Baker soon after the storm. \"We couldn't do it. But God did.\" Alphonso Jackson, the then US secretary of housing and urban development, made the racial implications of the gentrification process perfectly clear when he predicted that the reconstructed New Orleans would be a whiter city.</p> <p>In the three years since, race and class stereotypes have paved the way for New Orleans' so-called \"revitalisation\". \"We don't need soap opera-watchers right now\", claimed the city council president, Oliver Thomas \u2013 perpetuating the view that New Orleans' high unemployment rate can be tracked to individual laziness as opposed to the systemic discrimination affecting most of America's inner cities. At the same time, those same forces that demonise poor and particularly black families \u2013 for their apparent \"dysfunction\" \u2013 are actively preventing the regrouping of some of the most close-knit black communities in the US. </p> <p>The city is now in the process of phasing out the low-cost housing, public transportation system, and public health facilities that have supported the existence of low-income residents in New Orleans for decades. The US department of housing and urban development and the housing authority of New Orleans say that they wish to de-concentrate poverty in areas that were previously hotbeds for crime and drug abuse. Currently though, there are only plans to replace one-third of the units available for low-income renters. And as Audrey Stewart of the Loyola Law Clinic explains, the result is:</p> <blockquote> <p> ... thousands and thousands of homeless people camping out, under bridges, we have folks staying with relatives and friends \u2013 I see that all over my neighbourhood, five, six, seven, eight people living in these tiny houses. We have people getting kicked out of Fema [Federal Emergency Management Agency] trailers with nowhere to go.</p> </blockquote> <p>Many displaced New Orleans residents, black and white, are now calling for the \"right of return\" \u2013 and are in the process creating a dynamic grassroots movement that threatens to disrupt the relative calm that has eased the passage of the city's controversial reconstruction programme. This is just the kind of movement that Barack Obama spent the first part of his career organising for <a href=\"http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1177.html\">South Side</a> Chicago, and it may turn out that his ability as president to respond to this call proves decisive.</p> <p>Obama has been a vocal critic of the Bush administration's recovery and reconstruction programme, and his restoration plan for the region includes housing displaced residents who wish to return to the city. This time last year, Obama expressed concern that New Orleans would once again become the scene of the nation's broken promises, and told residents, \"I can promise you this: I will be a president who wakes up every morning and goes to bed every night with the future of this city on my mind.\" He said:</p> <blockquote> <p> ... racial discord, poverty, the old divisions of black and white, rich and poor, it's time to leave that to yesterday.</p> </blockquote> <p>But as the presidential campaign intensifies, Obama is increasingly under pressure to \"transcend race\".

  "<p>A group of British eco-enthusiasts have just pulled off the greenest and grubbiest car rally ever, driving from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/may/26/biofuels.carbonemissions\">London to Athens</a> in vehicles powered exclusively on waste vegetable oil. </p> <p>The team motored with unexpected ease across Europe on the proceeds of the grease thrown away by restaurants and cafes along the way. Their hope is that the 2,500-mile feat will help a drive to create a commodity out of cooking oils that otherwise end up in landfills or the sea. Unlike ethanol and other <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2008/apr/01/biofuels.forests?picture=335464523\">controversial biofuels</a>, recycled cooking fat does not impact on food production. </p> <p>\"I think we can safely say that this is the first long-distance car journey in Europe that has relied on restaurants and burger bars as an informal network of filling stations,\" said Andy Pag, a 34-year-old Londoner, who organised the rally. </p> <p>\"It's true we spent a lot of time fat-finding, knocking on the doors of restaurants begging for their waste, but it worked. And the beauty, of course, is that when such supplies are collected straight from a restaurant and used as fuel they have a zero-carbon footprint,\" he told the Guardian, after an awards ceremony highlighting alternatives to fossil fuels at the British embassy in Athens. </p> <p>Eight teams took part, driving cars that ranged from a brand new Renault to, in Pag's case, a 13\u2013year-old former taxi. They estimate that 350 litres of cooking oil were used to fuel the 11-day expedition. </p> <p>Some of the vehicles had been converted to run on vegetable oil. Those driving \"uncoverted\" cars brewed up biodiesel using a portable \"fuel pod\" processor \u2013 a 2,500lb (1,134kg) contraption carried in a transit van that they described as being \"as easy as a washing machine to use.\" </p> <p>Pag conducted his first carbon neutral trip in 2007, driving from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2007/nov/15/biodiesel\">London to Timbuktu</a> in a lorry powered by diesel made from cocoa butter, produced by a chocolate factory in the UK. He said he was amazed at the curiosity the rally engendered, with crowds invariably gathering to witness the re-fuelling process. </p> <p>\"We used what is known as an oily bits centrifuge system, the world's first mobile purification system for cars, to filter the waste en route,\" said Pag's co-driver, secondary school teacher Esther Obiri-Darko. \"It gets rid of all the crud.\" Manufactured in the UK, the system costs around \u00a3500 and includes a pump. </p> <p>The group's overarching aim is to encourage people to look at alternatives to fossil fuels. \"I think we made quite a lot of converts along the way,\" said Pag. \"There's a whole trail out there of restaurant owners who are now looking at their waste products with different eyes. Our hope is that others will start to realise the energy that is in waste, too.\"</p>",
  "<p>In a piece here yesterday, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/27/energy.oilandgascompanies1\">Zoe Gannon</a>, a Compass research fellow, argued that Britain should follow Norway's example by building up \"a \u00a3100bn fund, ear-marked for future generations\" from its oil tax revenues. This, she affirmed, could prove the key to reviving Labour's political fortunes and rebuilding a cross-class alliance capable of delivering the next election. The call has been endorsed by a number of other commentators here, such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/26/labour.tax\">Polly Toynbee</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/27/energy.oilandgascompanies\">Clive Betts</a>.</p> <p>Britain already taxes North Sea oil at a 50% rate. When the government last upped this it promised that it would be the last increase this parliament. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/27/energy.corporatesocialresponsibility\">Deborah Hargreaves</a> makes a number of good arguments against the principle of windfall taxes: they are unexpected and often penalise companies that are already being taxed quite heavily. The last time a windfall was levied it was to correct a previous give-away privatisation, but there is no serious evidence that companies have been profiteering from the recent oil price rise. Most energy companies are anyway global operations and it would be hard to identify what part of their business to levy, given that Britain cannot tax Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>But the Norwegian parallel is revealing, because Gannon is proposing almost exactly the opposite approach. As should be obvious from the phrase \"ear-marked for future generations\", Norway created an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Petroleum_Fund_of_Norway\">investment fund</a> from its oil revenue stream, that should not be raided for current expenditure, precisely as a safeguard against a time when oil prices might start to drop.</p> <p>Chile has created a similar fund from the income that it receives from copper. Brazil is currently discussing the creation of a fund based on these two models.</p> <p>The existence of these funds is widely credited with helping Norway and Chile escape the \"<a href=\"http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/natres/generaldebate/2003/12curse.htm\">resource curse</a>\" that has caused so much economic damage elsewhere. The phrase refers to the paradox that countries with an abundance of natural resources tend to have low average long-term economic growth. This can happen for a variety of reasons, one of which is that volatile flows of revenue can cause economic disruption and another is that easy windfalls from the resource sector can put off the need for necessary, but painful, economic reforms.</p> <p>By saving money when prices for their natural resources were high, both governments intentionally imposed a fiscal discipline on government spending. Britain, under Margaret Thatcher, by contrast, splurged much of its North Sea oil revenue in the yuppie boom of the late 1980s, which was fuelled by tax cuts and easy credit. Labour responded with Gordon Brown's famous mantra of \"no return to boom or bust\" when he first became chancellor.</p> <p>Clearly that is not quite the way that things have worked out. Britain is on the brink of recession, which some people are blaming on the price of oil. Neal Lawson, the chair of Compass, <a href=\"http://www.liberalconspiracy.org/2008/08/06/we-call-for-a-windfall-tax-on-energy-companies/\">says</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>The current spike in the price of oil means these companies are receiving unearned and undeserved windfall profits that are damaging to the rest of society, not least because the unprecedented price rises are fuelling inflation and therefore the cost of borrowing and repaying mortgages.</p> </blockquote> <p>But the link between the credit crunch and the global rise in commodity prices is tenuous. The latter has been caused by rising global demand \u2013 which mainly comes from the emerging economies of the south \u2013 while the former is mainly down to irresponsible lending by northern banks.</p> <p>The basic reason oil prices have risen so much is that there are more people in the world using more energy than ever before. The increase has largely been in the developing world. If you are looking for a culprit, blame it on the emerging middle class in countries like India, Brazil and China, rather than an illusory cartel of evil oil producers. </p> <p>If Britain were still a net exporter, rather than importer of oil, there might be some merit in the windfall tax argument. But imposing an arbitrary tax on energy companies on what little there is left is hardly the best way to encourage them to increase their investment in the country to find new sources. </p> <p>People in the rich world are simply going to have to start consuming less and that is the signal the market is currently sending them. Economies will have to adapt, because the remaining oil and gas will be far more expensive to reach. </p> <p>The best argument for the tax is that it could be used to fund a programme to improve domestic insulation \u2013 but the Compass claim that the tax could be used to tackle fuel poverty is contradictory. First of all, there is nothing to prevent the energy companies from passing on the tax in higher fuel prices and secondly you do not respond to an excess of demand over supply with measures aimed at increasing the former and reducing the latter.</p> <p>Clearly the rising price of oil is causing real economic hardship to the poorest, which puts additional demands on Britain's welfare state. Even <a href=\"http://www.opendemocracy.net/blog/ourkingdom-theme/tom-griffin/2008/08/20/osborne-takes-on-miliband-over-inequality\">George Osborne</a> now seems to think that something should be done about Britain's rising inequality and deepening poverty. But the nakedly populist and partisan nature of the Compass proposal does neither it, nor those Labour MPs and columnists backing it, much credit.</p>",
  "<p>More than a million people have been forced from their homes and 250,000 houses destroyed in one of the worst floods in northern India for decades, sparking accusations that the destruction was man-made.</p> <p>Described by the country's prime minister, Manmohan Singh, as a \"national calamity\", the flooding occurred after the Kosi river burst its banks in Nepal ten days ago, sending floodwaters across a swath of the eastern flank of the Himalayas and submerging large parts of the Indian state of Bihar.<br> Today the Indian army mobilised, evacuating more than 100,000 people and dropping food supplies from the air. Pratyaya Amrit, Bihar's secretary for disaster management, said that a further 300,000 people would be moved to relief camps in the next 48 hours. Experts have said that the flooding was not simply an act of nature, and that the failure of the Indian authorities played a large part in the making of the disaster. The Kosi river's flood defences are supposed to be able to handle flows of almost a million cubic feet of water per second. Yet they were breached when the flows were a little more than a tenth of that capacity, pointing to serious defects.  Nepal, where the Kosi originates from, has accused the Indian government of failing to uphold its commitment under a 1954 treaty to maintain the river's embankment. India countered that its engineers could not get access to river.  \"We know the monsoon comes every year. Why weren't they ready for the disaster? The fact is that there was much less flow in the river than the stated capacity which exposes the kind of maintenance that was done,\" said Himanshu Thakkar, coordinator of the independent South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People. Thakkar said that there was an \"unfortunate lobby consisting of politicians, bureaucrats, builders and engineers who take money and don't do any work. There is no oversight of this process. That's why we get flooding every year.\"</p> <p>Relief agencies said that Bihar's status as the poorest, most deprived state in India meant that victims of the annual monsoons were especially vulnerable. <br> \"During our flood response last year we found that the levels of children trafficked from the state increased in large numbers. Two of the affected districts Arraria and Katiyar according to our study have the highest instance of child trafficking. The current disaster will increase levels of poverty and desperation and create a favourable environment for traffickers,\" said Thomas Chandy, CEO of Save the Children.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337037213\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2008/08/28/india_floods_2808.gif\" alt=\"Map - India floods\" width=\"460\" height=\"392\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>",

Xfm has had a troubled life ever since it had the misfortune of <a href=\"http://www.mediauk.com/the_knowledge/i.muk/Xfm\">launching</a> on the day Princess Diana died 11 years ago.</p> <p>Then it was <a href=\"http://www.nme.com/news/nme/201\">bought up by Capital Radio</a>, and with the advent of digital radio the local station suddenly had the prospect of <a href=\"http://corporate.gcapmedia.com/index.php?id=24\">going national</a>.</p> <p>Except it never happened. Instead there was a string of relaunches, new music policies and changes of management, which culminated in the bizarre decision last year to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/may/17/radio.musicnews\">axe its daytime DJs.</a> The tactic didn't last, but then not much on Xfm ever did.</p> <p>With Xfm in south Wales having been <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/may/30/gcapmedia.commercialradio1\">bought by Town and Country Broadcasting</a> and subsequently relaunched as Nation Radio, the future of the remaining two Xfms appears bleak.</p> <p>It would be harder for Global to relaunch the London or Manchester stations as it has done in Scotland, because the licence requirements on the sort of music they play are stricter.</p> <p>Indeed, if Global wants to extend its Galaxy brand into London then it is more likely to <a href=\"http://www.choice-fm.co.uk/\">rebrand Choice</a> than Xfm.</p> <p>But a rebrand is not out of the question. Nor is a sale, with several interested parties said to be queuing up to cast an eye over the London station's books. The Manchester station, which is said to be in a less healthy financial state, is less attractive.</p> <p>The reality is that Xfm is the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQbWWje180w&amp;feature=related\">runt of the GCap litter</a> bought up by Global, which is pouring all its efforts - and money - into its two super-brands, Galaxy and Heart.</p> <p>So what went wrong with Xfm? Over to Xfm founder, now <a href=\"http://www.nme.com/radio\">NME Radio</a> managing director, Sammy Jacob:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Once we sold it [to Capital Radio] in 1998 it never really had a clear focus. It was pulled left, right and centre, with different management imposing different visions, trying to make it what they wanted it to be rather than what it should have been.</p> <p>\"It undermined what we set out to do. Like any brand if you don't have a clear vision then it is just going to dilute and whither away.</p> <p>\"Last year it had a lower market share than when we first launched it. Ten years on it should have had a much more significant presence.</p> <p>\"But every time they seemed to get on the right track, it seemed management didn't have sufficient patience to stick with it. It is very sad and frustrating.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>So where did <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/organgrinder/2007/11/remember_when_xfm_london_was_g.html\">Xfm</a> jump the shark, or <a href=\"http://www.nerve.com/CS/blogs/screengrab/archive/2008/07/31/indiana-does-linguistics-nuking-the-fridge-with-professor-jones.aspx\">nuke the fridge</a> as we should now say? For some it was when it was bought up by Capital in 1998. For others it may be when Bob Geldof, the new \"star\" DJ parachuted in by its new owners, announced Ian Dury had died. He hadn't.</p> <p>Or maybe it was in 2002 when it signed up big name DJs such as former Radio 1 breakfast host <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2003/dec/16/radio.commercialradio\">Zoe Ball</a>. Personally speaking, I rather liked it back then.

  "<p>Scottish media company SMG has posted a pre-tax profit of \u00a34.2m in the first half of 2008, with its core TV business reporting flat revenues year on year.</p> <p>SMG, which reported 14% year-on-year growth in regional TV ad revenue for the first six months of 2008, said that it remains on track to hit full-year targets \"despite difficult market conditions\".</p> <p>In its interim results published today, SMG focused on the performance of its television business STV, which also includes production and digital operations, as it looks to sell non-core businesses such as cinema operation Pearl &amp; Dean.</p> <p>STV's revenue remained flat year on year at \u00a356m, with operating profit up by 26% at \u00a34.9m. </p> <p>SMG is to rebrand its whole business as stv after more than a decade when it expanded into radio, newspaper publishing, outdoor and cinema advertising - all businesses that have now been sold or are in the process of being offloaded.</p> <p>Within STV, operating profits in the broadcasting operation grew 49% year on year to \u00a35.2m, with national airtime revenue flat and regional airtime ad revenue up 14% for the period.</p> <p>SMG's share price remained unchanged in early trading today, at 9p at 11.15am.</p> <p>\"Clearly the economic environment is significantly more challenging in 2008 but we are on track to outperform the market for the full year, especially in the regional advertising market,\" said the SMG chief executive, Rob Woodward. </p> <p>\"The board is confident in continuing to execute its growth strategy and [the company] will continue to outperform in 2009,\" Woodward added.</p> <p>SMG forecast that in the third quarter of 2008 it expects regional TV advertising revenues to be up 16% year on year - flat in October and with \"growth expected\" for November and December.</p> <p>However, in terms of national TV ad revenues the forecast for the third quarter is for a 15% year-on-year drop and a \"low double-digit decline\" in October, according to SMG.</p> <p>STV's content division, which makes shows including Taggart, saw a slight year-on-year dip in revenue to \u00a35.7m, primarily because its programming is \"second half weighted\" for the autumn 2008 and winter 2009 TV seasons.</p> <p>The company's ventures division, which includes premium-rate phone and digital operations, saw revenue growth of 19% year on year to \u00a33.7m - but a drop in operating profit.</p> <p>Overall figures for SMG Group - which include revenues from Virgin Radio and outdoor ad company Primesight, both of which have been sold, and the non-core Pearl &amp; Dean cinema advertising business - show that the company managed to significantly reduce its half-year loss year on year from \u00a341.6m to \u00a311.9m.</p> <p>The company also reduced net debt by more than 90% to \u00a315.1m from \u00a3189.4m a year ago.</p> <p>SMG Group revenue fell to \u00a375.6m in the first half of 2008, compared with \u00a388.9m in the same period last year. Operating profit fell from \u00a36.9m to \u00a35.4m for the same comparative period.</p> <p>Pearl &amp; Dean saw a year-on-year revenue drop of \u00a31m to \u00a38.3m in the first six months of the year and a small increase in operating losses to \u00a3500,000.</p> <p>The company said that this was due to the seasonal nature of the business and a \"weak first four months of films\". </p> <p>SMG forecast Pearl &amp; Dean's ad revenue in the third quarter to be down 10% year on year, with a \"low single-digit decline\" for October.</p> <p>Virgin Radio, which was sold to Times of India subsidiary TIML for \u00a353m in June, saw revenue drop by almost \u00a31m to \u00a311.3m and a fall in operating profit from \u00a32.5m in the first half of 2007 to \u00a31m in the first half of 2008.</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p>International estate agent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/savills\">Savills</a> has seen pre-tax profits tumble by a hefty 41% as the global credit crunch and downturn in the City has dampened demand for its high-value properties.</p> <p>The London-listed consultancy, which specialises in upmarket homes, said this morning that falling UK property investment led to a drop in demand for some of its highest fee-earning services. With demand for expensive houses in London having nearly halved this year, owners of large country houses are now expected to feel the chill.</p> <p>The announcement comes as Nationwide reported the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/aug/28/houseprices.property\">first double-digit fall</a> in house prices in August since the housing market crisis in the early 1990s, when the UK was last in the throes of a recession.</p> <p>\"2008 continues to be a challenging year for the real estate industry worldwide,\" warned Peter Smith, the chairman of Savills.</p> <p>The gloomy trading update follows <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jul/08/savills.persimmon\">a warning last month</a> that the housing market downturn had spread to the heart of London and to country mansions, the source of most of Savills' business. </p> <p>Today's statement showed that transaction volumes in London were down about 45% during the first six months of the year compared with the same period in 2007, with prices about 7% lower. Country property was less affected but is expected to follow suit throughout 2008.</p> <p>The group has already acknowledged that the tough trading conditions, due to the credit crunch and rising unemployment in the City, will make it \"very difficult\" to predict the future.</p> <p>But it said that the overall outcome would depend on what happened in the second half of the year.</p> <p>Savills' chief executive, Jeremy Helsby, is understood to have told colleagues that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/24/realestateindustry.savills\">he envisages house prices falling by 25%</a> by the end of next year.</p> <p>During the first six months to June, profits at Savills fell to \u00a319.2m from \u00a332.5m in the same period a year ago, reflecting weaker housing markets in Britain and Europe.</p> <p>Group revenues for the period dipped to \u00a3278.1m from \u00a3284.2m last year, with strong demand in Asian countries such as Hong Kong, Singapore and China helping to offset the European and US economic slowdown and shore up group revenues.</p> <p>Looking ahead, the Savills chairman said conditions in Europe would remain challenging as the impact of the credit squeeze is increasingly felt. He added that slower UK economic growth this year and in 2009 would also affect the level of tenant demand.</p> <p>However, he added that the firm's strategy of expanding its consultancy and property management businesses had served it well in these unsettled markets. Cost-reduction measures have been taken, with a number of employees being laid off.</p> <p>Today's results were well received by the market, with Savills' shares up 11% at 269p in afternoon trading</p>",
  "<p>Aer Lingus warned today that it needs to cut costs across its business, raising fears of job losses, after plunging into a loss for the first half of this year.</p> <p>The airline posted an operating loss of \u20ac22.3m (\u00a317.9m) for the first half of this year, down from an operating profit of \u20ac2.6m a year earlier, and warned that it will not make a profit in the next six months.</p> <p>Chief executive Dermot Mannion blamed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/oil\">the soaring oil price</a> and warned that \"without making fundamental changes in our operating cost base\" it could make a much larger loss in 2009.</p> <p>Like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/theairlineindustry\">other airlines</a>, Aer Lingus is threatened by the weakening global economy as well as the sharp increase in the cost of fuel.</p> <p>\"Things will not bounce back. We are heading for a pretty difficult challenge, and we need to take a surgical look at costs across the whole business,\" said an Aer Lingus spokesman this morning.</p> <p>He added that the company's cost per passenger is roughly double that of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/ryanair\">rival Ryanair</a>, suggesting there is the potential to take significant costs out of the business.</p> <p>Potential areas for savings include staffing, its flight network and its existing deals with the airports it flies to. Aer Lingus has already decided to cut its long-haul capacity for this winter by 11% but is only reducing its short-haul flights by 1%.</p> <p>Although the oil price has fallen in recent weeks from its high of almost $150 a barrel, airlines still face much higher fuel bills than in the past.</p> <p>Aer Lingus spent \u20ac253m on fuel in 2007 but this will rise to \u20ac390m in 2008. If it were to hedge all of next year's fuel bill today, the cost would rise to \u20ac463m.</p> <p>\"We're looking at a three-figure loss in 2009, potentially, if we don't look at our costs,\" the Aer Lingus spokesman explained.</p> <p>Oil was trading up around one dollar today at $119 a barrel, as tropical storm Gustav headed towards production facilities in the Gulf of Mexico.</p> <p>Back in June, Ryanair warned that its profits for this year would probably be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jun/04/ryanair.oil\">wiped out by the cost of fuel</a>.</p>",

  "<p><br>Stranded in the wilderness ... Jared's Leto's 30 Seconds to Mars try to abandon EMI. Photograph: PR</p> <p>Jared Leto's band 30 Seconds to Mars are embroiled in a <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/eonline/20080815/en_music_eo/24143 with EMI\">legal battle</a>. The band has invoked the <a href=\"http://law.onecle.com/california/labor/2855.html\">California Labor Code</a> in an attempt to escape the label. This states that a contract cannot be enforced against an employee after seven years (the band signed their deal in 1999). EMI, in turn, are now exercising their right (stated in the same labour code) to sue the band for violating the terms of contract by refusing to deliver an additional three albums - and they want $30m.</p> <p>30 Seconds to Mars are not the first to resort to the California Labor Code Section 2855 when dissatisfied with the terms of their contract. Created in 1937, it became known as the <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/industryNews/idUSN2329585820070824\">\"de Havilland law\"</a>, after actress Olivia de Havilland used it to fight the then oppressive studio contract system. <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9805E2DB113AF93BA1575AC0A962958260\">Metallica</a> and <a href=\"http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-11497730_ITM\">Courtney Love</a> - among others - have used it in the past to either get out of or renegotiate their deals.</p> <p>It's easy to see these legal cases as a David v Goliath scenario - the artist fighting the corporation - and, speaking as a musician, I tend take the side of the artist. But I can see the label's point of view too. To launch a new artist on a global scale costs a lot of money. Record labels are companies that don't see a return on their investments for years down the line - if ever.</p> <p>In an online statement, <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2008/08/18/virginemi-sue-30-seconds-to-mars-for-30-million-leto-fights-back/\">Jared Leto writes</a>: \"If you think the fact that we have sold in excess of 2m records and have never been paid a penny is pretty unbelievable, well, so do we.\"</p> <p>It's ridiculous, but not entirely unbelievable. Most record deals state that all expenses are recoupable against artists' royalties. Every limo taken, every flight and hotel room, production costs of MTV Awards performances (they're usually paid for by the artist/label), as well as advertising and tour costs - it all adds up, and it's all recoupable. If more artists took into consideration that it's their own money they're spending (that is, if they actually sell enough records to pay back what the label has spent), they might just start driving themselves and flying economy instead of first class.</p> <p>Still, I agree that signing a contract at the beginning of your career that ties you down for a decade or more can be frustrating and unfair. Especially if the label you signed to is then swallowed up by a bigger corporation (I signed to BMG Publishing, but my back catalogue now belongs to Universal, who <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2006/sep/07/business/fi-bmg7\">bought the company</a>).</p> <p>Jared Leto continues: \"The new regime at EMI is firing most of the people we know and love, wanting to place advertisements on our website, EMI owning 100% of the masters of our record ... forever, and basically having a revolving door of regimes at the company made it easy to not want to continue as is.\"</p> <p>That EMI is suing the band for $30m is beyond excessive. The label says it wants to resolve the matter amicably and continue working with the band \"to take them to even greater levels of success\".</p> <p>The question is: once you've sued someone, what are the chances that you'll have an amicable, productive working relationship? Ask any divorcee. You can't force someone to make a great record and, ultimately, both artists and labels are in the business to make great records. That's why almost every single case like this has been settled out of court.</p> <p>The most likely outcome is that 30 Seconds to Mars will go back to the negotiating table and work out a more favourable contract with EMI, or the label will decide it's not worth the legal costs, cut their losses and walk away - leaving the band free to sign with another label. What do you think are the chances?</p>",

But I'll do my best.</p> <p>Hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she'll do everything she can to elect Barack Obama. </p> <p>That makes two of us.</p> <p>Actually that makes 18m of us - because, like Hillary, I want all of you who supported her to vote for Barack Obama in November.</p> <p>Here's why.</p> <p>Our nation is in trouble on two fronts: The American dream is under siege at home, and America's leadership in the world has been weakened. </p> <p>Middle-class and low-income Americans are hurting, with incomes declining; job losses, poverty and inequality rising; mortgage foreclosures and credit card debt increasing; healthcare coverage disappearing; and a big spike in the cost of food, utilities and gasoline.</p> <p>Our position in the world has been weakened by too much unilateralism and too little cooperation; a perilous dependence on imported oil; a refusal to lead on global warming; a growing indebtedness and a dependence on foreign lenders; a severely burdened military; a backsliding on global non-proliferation and arms control agreements; and a failure to consistently use the power of diplomacy, from the Middle East to Africa to Latin America to Central and Eastern Europe.</p> <p>Clearly, the job of the next president is to rebuild the American dream and restore America's standing in the world.</p> <p>Everything I learned in my eight years as president and in the work I've done since, in America and across the globe, has convinced me that Barack Obama is the man for this job.</p> <p>He has a remarkable ability to inspire people, to raise our hopes and rally us to high purpose. He has the intelligence and curiosity every successful President needs. His policies on the economy, taxes, healthcare and energy are far superior to the Republican alternatives. He has shown a clear grasp of our foreign policy and national security challenges, and a firm commitment to repair our badly strained military. His family heritage and life experiences have given him a unique capacity to lead our increasingly diverse nation and to restore our leadership in an ever more interdependent world. The long, hard primary tested and strengthened him. And in his first presidential decision, the selection of a running mate, he hit it out of the park. </p> <p>With Joe Biden's experience and wisdom, supporting Barack Obama's proven understanding, insight and good instincts, America will have the national security leadership we need.</p> <p>Barack Obama is ready to lead America and restore American leadership in the world. Ready to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. Barack Obama is ready to be president of the United States.</p> <p>He will work for an America with more partners and fewer adversaries. He will rebuild our frayed alliances and revitalize the international institutions which help to share the costs of the world's problems and to leverage our power and influence. He will put us back in the forefront of the world's fight to reduce nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and to stop global warming. He will continue and enhance our nation's global leadership in an area in which I am deeply involved, the fight against AIDS, TB and malaria, including a renewal of the battle against HIV/AIDS here at home. He will choose diplomacy first and military force as a last resort. But in a world troubled by terror; by trafficking in weapons, drugs and people; by human rights abuses; by other threats to our security, our interests and our values, when he cannot convert adversaries into partners, he will stand up to them.</p> <p>Barack Obama also will not allow the world's problems to obscure its opportunities. Everywhere, in rich and poor countries alike, hardworking people need good jobs; secure, affordable healthcare, food and energy; quality education for their children; and economically beneficial ways to fight global warming. These challenges cry out for American ideas and American innovation. When Barack Obama unleashes them, America will save lives, win new allies, open new markets and create new jobs for our people. </p> <p>Most important, Barack Obama knows that America cannot be strong abroad unless we are strong at home. People the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power. </p> <p>Look at the example the Republicans have set: American workers have given us consistently rising productivity. They've worked harder and produced more. What did they get in return? Declining wages, less than a quarter as many new jobs as in the previous eight years, smaller healthcare and pension benefits, rising poverty and the biggest increase in income inequality since the 1920s. American families by the millions are struggling with soaring healthcare costs and declining coverage. I will never forget the parents of children with autism and other severe conditions who told me on the campaign trail that they couldn't afford healthcare and couldn't qualify their kids for Medicaid unless they quit work or got a divorce. Are these the family values the Republicans are so proud of? What about the military families pushed to the breaking point by unprecedented multiple deployments? What about the assault on science and the defense of torture? What about the war on unions and the unlimited favors for the well connected? What about Katrina and cronyism?</p> <p>America can do better than that. And Barack Obama will. </p> <p>But first we have to elect him.</p> <p>The choice is clear. The Republicans will nominate a good man who served our country heroically and suffered terribly in Vietnam. He loves our country every bit as much as we all do. As a senator, he has shown his independence on several issues. But on the two great questions of this election, how to rebuild the American dream and how to restore America's leadership in the world, he still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years, a philosophy we never had a real chance to see in action until 2001, when the Republicans finally gained control of both the White House and Congress. Then we saw what would happen to America if the policies they had talked about for decades were implemented.</p> <p>They took us from record surpluses to an exploding national debt; from over 22m new jobs down to 5m; from an increase in working family incomes of $7,500 to a decline of more than $2,000; from almost 8m Americans moving out of poverty to more than 5 and a half million falling into poverty - and millions more losing their health insurance. </p> <p>Now, in spite of all the evidence, their candidate is promising more of the same: More tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans that will swell the deficit, increase inequality and weaken the economy. More Band-aids for healthcare that will enrich insurance companies, impoverish families and increase the number of uninsured. More going it alone in the world, instead of building the shared responsibilities and shared opportunities necessary to advance our security and restore our influence.</p> <p>They actually want us to reward them for the last eight years by giving them four more. Let's send them a message that will echo from the Rockies all across America: Thanks, but no thanks. In this case, the third time is not the charm.</p> <p>My fellow Democrats, 16 years ago, you gave me the profound honour to lead our party to victory and to lead our nation to a new era of peace and broadly shared prosperity. </p> <p>Together, we prevailed in a campaign in which the Republicans said I was too young and too inexperienced to be commander-in-chief. Sound familiar? It didn't work in 1992, because we were on the right side of history. And it won't work in 2008, because Barack Obama is on the right side of history. </p> <p>His life is a 21st-century incarnation of the American dream. His achievements are proof of our continuing progress toward the \"more perfect union\" of our founders' dreams. The values of freedom and equal opportunity which have given him his historic chance will drive him as president to give all Americans, regardless of race, religion, gender, sexual orientation or disability, their chance to build a decent life, and to show our humanity, as well as our strength, to the world. </p> <p>We see that humanity, that strength, and our future in Barack and Michelle Obama and their beautiful children. We see them reinforced by the partnership with Joe Biden, his wife Jill, a dedicated teacher, and their family.</p> <p>Barack Obama will lead us away from division and fear of the last eight years back to unity and hope. If, like me, you still believe America must always be a place called Hope, then join Hillary, Chelsea and me in making senator Barack Obama the next president of the United States.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337018564\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>Bill Clinton left all the bitterness over his wife's defeat in the Democratic nomination battle behind him at the entrance to the convention centre on Wednesday night to heap plaudit after plaudit on Barack Obama.</p> <p>Clinton, in spite of strained relations with Obama as a result of the bruising primary contests, went further in his prime time speech than Hillary Clinton the previous night. He not only pledged to support him, but he listed a host of reasons why he would make a good president.</p> <p>The speech, more than anything else heard at the convention so far, helped to speed the process of reunifying the party.</p> <p>\"Everything I learned in my eight years as president and in the work I've done since, in America and across the globe, has convinced me that Barack Obama is the man for this job,\" the former president said.</p> <p>This was his answer to critics who said that while Hillary Clinton told the convention on Tuesday night she would support Obama, she failed to say she thought he would make a good president.</p> <p>Bill Clinton put this right, offering fulsome praise for Obama for his \"remarkable ability to inspire people\" but also for his grasp of foreign policy and economics.</p> <p>\"Barack Obama is ready to lead America and restore American leadership in the world: ready to preserve, protect and defend the constitution of the United States. Barack Obama is ready to be president of the United States,\" Clinton said.</p> <p>The former president remains a party favourite, receiving a five-minute standing ovation when he stepped up to the podium and shouts of \"Bill, Bill, Bill\". The reception he received put to rest fears that his reputation inside the party had been badly damaged by the aggressive way he had gone after Obama during the primary battles.</p> <p>In spite of the overwhelming support in public, Clinton in private remains resentful and is not intending to stay in Denver to hear his speech Thursday. His aides said this was not a slight and he had not stayed to hear acceptance speeches in 2000 or 2004 either.</p> <p>Opening the prime time speech, he said: \"I am here first to support Barack Obama.\" He then joked he was the warm-up act for Joe Biden, the vice-presidential candidate, who was to speak later in the evening.</p> <p>Watched by Hillary sitting among the delegates, he also joked about the fierceness of the long and hard fought primary battle, saying it had \"generated so much heat it increased global warming\".<br>But he put that in the past. \"Hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she'll do everything she can to elect Barack Obama. That makes two of us.\"</p> <p>He praised the Republican candidate John McCain for his service in Vietnam but said he too embraced the \"extreme philosophy\" of President George Bush that had done so much harm to the economy and the US abroad.</p> <p>\"Barack Obama knows that America cannot be strong abroad unless we are strong at home,\" he said People the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power.\"<br>Towards the end, Clinton effectively anointed Obama as his successor. He recalled that he had won the election 16 years ago in a campaign in which the Republicans said he was too young and inexperienced to be commander in chief. \"Sounds familiar? It did'nt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history. And it won't work in 2008 because Barack Obama is on the right side of history.\"</p>",
