  "<p>The British 10,000m athlete Jo Pavey is determined to put her world championships disappointment behind her by overcoming the dominant Ethiopians to win her first Olympic medal.</p> <p>Pavey finished fourth in Osaka last summer after being overtaken in the final sprint for the line, a result which left her frustrated but even more motivated for Olympic success. The 34-year-old, a former room-mate and close friend of Dame Kelly Holmes, heads into Beijing next week eager to claim a place on the Olympic podium.</p> <p>\"Everything we do is about trying to achieve a medal at the Olympics,\" said Pavey, who is competing at her third Games. \"Although last year was the first year I ran the 10,000m, I was frustrated to just miss out on a medal at the world championships.</p> <p>\"But that experience gave me the motivation to keep training hard and go that one step better in Beijing.\"</p> <p>Pavey is now a veteran of major championships. Her Olympic debut was in Sydney in 2000, when she first shared a room with Holmes. On that occasion she was \"thrilled\" just to make the final of the 5,000m as she struggled to come to terms with the pressure of competing at the Games.</p> <p>In Athens four years later she finished fifth in the 5,000m, an effort which was overshadowed by Holmes's second gold medal, achieved less than half an hour earlier. But Pavey's role in that triumph was not insignificant. Holmes believes their friendship - \"we seemed to laugh all the time,\" she wrote in her autobiography - played an important role in keeping her relaxed as she completed that historic gold medal double.</p> <p>Pavey is determined to earn her own moment that will bring her widespread recognition. She has put her name down for the 5,000m but more as a back-up plan than anything else. That Osaka experience helped crystallise her thinking and her sole focus now is to win a 10,000m medal. Ethiopia have four athletes entered in the event, including the world championships gold medallist Tirunesh Dibaba.</p> <p>Pavey may well have to change her asthma medication in order to deal with the oppressive environment, but the Devon-born athlete is used to competing in energy-sapping conditions. \"I am really excited about it and I think the experience of Osaka will stand me in good stead. The 10,000m is what I have focused all my training on,\" she said.</p> <p>\"The race at the world championships came down to who could handle the heat best. It was over 37 degrees and there was really high humidity. It became more of a slog, who could last out? That was an unusual situation for a championship but I think Beijing will be the same.</p> <p>\"The Ethiopians have been the ones to watch for a number of years. They have set the world records in recent times, they have fast finishes and are very difficult to beat. But you need to think about your strategies rather than just the strengths and weaknesses of the opposition. How can you prepare to deal with the conditions and use that to your advantage?</p> <p>\"You have got to be at your absolute best on the day at the Olympics. I have these new running shoes which weigh less than 100 grams so that might help me run a bit faster. It is exciting.\"</p>",
  "<p>Rising energy and fuel prices are affecting everyone (Report, August 4). We believe the moment is right for a one-off windfall tax to guarantee social and environmental justice.</p> <p>The average annual spend on energy per household has breached \u00a31,200. Since 2000 gas prices have risen by 100%, and electricity by 61%, with further increases to come, including British Gas raising gas bills by a record 35%; the main energy providers have seen profits rise from \u00a3557m in 2003 to over \u00a33bn now. Also, the spike in oil prices means oil companies are receiving unearned windfall profits that are damaging society, not least because the price rises are fuelling inflation. </p> <p>The government estimates that 2.5 million families are living in fuel poverty. Yet despite the billions in profits, the energy industry spends just \u00a350m a year combating fuel poverty and has only agreed to raise this to \u00a3150m by 2010. </p> <p>At the same time there is a lack of investment in renewable energy to help Britain become energy-independent and more carbon-neutral. Just as government responded to the oil shocks of the 1970s, investing in North Sea oil, so government must intervene to secure sustainable energy supplies for the 21st century and reduce the fear of fuel poverty. It is right that the corporations benefiting from that original investment and the later privatisation pay their fair share to society.</p> <p>As precedent, a windfall tax was levied when Labour came to power in 1997 on the unearned profits of the privatised utilities, raising \u00a34.5bn. Similarly, in 1981 the Conservative government levied a windfall tax on the unearned profits of the main banks. In 2008 the spike in oil prices has created substantial unearned profits for the oil and energy companies - we therefore call for a windfall tax. </p> <p>Revenues from the tax should be ringfenced to deliver social and environmental justice for all. Some should be targeted at families in or facing fuel poverty. However, the best strategy to eliminate fuel poverty for ever is to ensure every home is insulated and energy-efficient to the highest standards. Therefore much of the money should be used to kick-start a national programme of home energy efficiency and installing renewable energy, starting with the homes of the fuel-poor.</p> <p>This could benefit the UK economy - just as the New Deal in 1997 created new jobs, such an investment could see the creation of thousands of jobs in renewable energy production, insulation, building renovation and other sectors. The 1997 measure took three months to enact; the government can move quickly now.</p> <p><strong>Neal Lawson </strong>Compass,<strong> Gavin Hayes </strong>Compass,<strong> Ed Matthew </strong>Friends of the Earth,<strong> Tony Juniper, Kate Green </strong>Child Poverty Action Group,<strong> Roy Hattersley, Chuka Umunna, Nicky Gavron, Cllr Jon Collins, Richard Burden MP, Karen Buck MP, Roger Berry MP, Prof Ruth Lister, Tony Robinson, Dave Prentis </strong>Unison,<strong> Keith Norman </strong>Aslef,<strong> Guy Palmer </strong>New Policy Institute,<strong> Helena Kennedy QC, Tony Woodley </strong>Unite,<strong> Andrew Simms </strong>New Economics Foundation,<strong> Wes Streeting </strong>President, NUS</p>",
  "<p>The growing gap between rich and poor in booming Asian economies has left behind \"vast numbers of mothers and children\", putting millions of lives at risk, a report by Unicef said yesterday. </p> <p>The United Nation's children's agency said more than 40% of the world's children who died before their fifth birthday in 2006 lived in the Asia Pacific region - and urged governments to face up to \"inequities in access to healthcare and disparities in health outcomes\". </p> <p>\"The divide between rich and poor is rising at a troubling rate within subregions of Asia Pacific, leaving vast numbers of mothers and children at risk,\" the State of Asia Pacific's Children 2008 report said.</p> <p>It said 2.5 million child deaths occurred in India and China, the two fastest-growing major economies in the world, accounting for nearly a third of global child deaths. In India the figure was 2.1 million; in China it was 415,000. Although Unicef called for Beijing to step up efforts to stem child deaths, it was plain that India had much work to do - despite clocking four years of high economic growth.</p> <p>The report said the fast-growing Indian economy needed \"across-the-board\" improvements in healthcare, gender equality and child protection. Particularly troubling was that south Asia spent so little - with only 1.1% of gross domestic product allocated - on health.</p> <p>\"It is not just bigger health budgets. We could make a big difference by focusing on the three or four states in north India where most of these children die. Governments need to tackle female discrimination in the region too. Half the child deaths recorded in Pakistan, India and Afghanistan occurred in the first month of the baby's life,\" said Daniel Toole, a regional director for Unicef.</p> <p>The boom in private sector healthcare for the region's expanding middle classes was also draining hospitals of highly-qualified staff, with offers of better paid jobs in private clinics.</p> <p>With half the world's children living in the region, Unicef said it was imperative for governments to act if the 2015 global goal of reducing under-five mortality by two-thirds of 1990 levels was to be met.</p> <p>\"India could learn from China's experience in two big ways,\" said Toole. </p> <p>\"One is getting health services out to the villages ... the other is female education. Educated women making educated choices has a big impact on the survival of their children.\"</p>",
  "<p>The upmarket US supermarket chain Whole Foods is facing an uphill struggle to expand across the Atlantic after suffering losses of $18.4m (\u00a39m) in a year at its six newly opened stores in Britain.</p> <p>Whole Foods, which specialises in organic and healthy produce, last night revealed that it was reviewing its nascent British operations and will be cutting back on openings in its home market. </p> <p>\"We are disappointed in our results in the UK,\" chief executive John Mackey said. \"We are carefully evaluating all aspects of our operations in the UK.\"</p> <p>Whole Foods' global profits slumped 31% to $33.9m, sending its shares tumbling 15% in after-hours trading on the Nasdaq exchange. It blamed sluggish economic conditions for a slowing in sales growth in the US, where it will open only 15 stores over the next 12 months rather than the planned 30 or 40.</p> <p>In Britain, the arrival of Whole Foods was billed last year as a potential boon to gourmets. Its London outlet is spread over three floors of a former Barkers department store in Kensington. But the company's results suggest that shoppers are yet to be won over.</p> <p>Mackey said there had been some improvement in recent months with UK losses dropping to $16m on an annualised basis. \"Our goal is to reduce our operating losses to $13m in fiscal year 2009, $7m in fiscal year 2010 and to approach break-even in 2011,\" he said, adding that Whole Foods had suffered similar initial losses when it entered Canada.</p> <p>\"We believe the long-term growth potential in the UK is much greater th an in Canada.\"</p>",
  "<p>Cable networks, television and movies powered a 59% surge in annual profits at News Corporation although media mogul Rupert Murdoch warned last night that \"less robust growth\" was imminent.</p> <p>Global profits jumped from $3.4bn to $5.4bn in the year to June at the media empire which recently took over the Wall Street Journal's publisher, Dow Jones.</p> <p>For the fourth quarter, earnings were up 21% to $1.5bn.</p> <p>Among top performers for the full year were News Corp's cable channels in the US and 20th Century Fox film studio which perked up in the final quarter of the year thanks to DVD releases such as Juno and Alvin and the Chipmunks.</p> <p>Murdoch said he was \"extremely pleased\" with the results but sounded a note of caution on the year ahead. \"Although we clearly face more challenging macro-economic conditions in fiscal '09, we're well positioned to deliver continued, if somewhat less robust growth,\" he said.</p> <p>Profits from News Corp's newspaper division rose by $114m to $767m as Dow Jones provided an initial contribution of $24m. The Wall Street Journal's pay-to-access website emerged as a moneyspinner with an 88% jump in online subscriptions. \"That the newspaper sector is changing is clear,\" Murdoch said. \"But companies willing to invest in new forms of delivery, which have a commitment to quality, will prosper.\"</p> <p>In Britain, where Murdoch owns the Times and the Sun, the company said its newspaper profits were slightly higher as a drop in depreciation costs on printing equipment offset weak advertising revenue. But News Corp's 39% stake in broadcaster BSkyB turned in a deficit of $145m as BSkyB wrote down the value of its stake in ITV.</p> <p>In the US, earnings from the Fox television channels fell sharply in the final quarter, reflecting lower ratings after a strike by writers disrupted programming.</p>",
  "<p><strong>1 Chose a name</strong></p> <p>A posh part of London or New York can be suitable, as in Pershing Square Capital, Cheyne Capital and Thames River Capital. </p> <p>Or you could choose something slightly aggressive such as Tiger Capital, Citadel Capital or Centaurus. Among the big financial firms, it is voguish to squeeze as many meaningless words as possible into the title of a hedge fund. Length is not a sign of quality, however; a Bear Stearns hedge fund which went from $642m to zero was called the \"high-grade structured credit strategies enhanced leverage fund\".</p> <p><strong>2 Get a brass plaque in the Cayman Islands </strong></p> <p>Nearly all hedge funds are legally registered in tax havens to avoid both the taxman and to skirt regulatory hurdles - the sunny climes of the Caymans and Bermuda are particularly popular. Theoretically, a fund registered in London would have to register with the Financial Services Authority, but this has never actually happened. An FSA spokeswoman says: \"Nobody ever registers hedge funds in the UK. If somebody did, we'd be scratching our heads over how to deal with it. We'd have to devise something.\"</p> <p><strong>3 Set your fees </strong></p> <p>The real fun starts here. Hedge funds are enormously lucrative - their standard fee arrangement is \"two and 20\". This means that as a fund manager, you can take 2% of clients' money up front before you do anything, then keep 20% of any appreciation on the value of your fund. For successful hedgies, that means a phenomenal payday. For example, if a fund raises $1bn from investors and achieves a 30% rise in value over a year, the fund's management earns $78.8m. Crispin Odey - one of London's leading hedge fund managers - has just paid himself \u00a328m after his firm successfully negotiated the credit crunch to make more than \u00a355m profit in the past financial year. Most of the remaining \u00a327m will be shared among Odey Asset Management's 11 other partners. The fund manages around \u00a32.7bn of assets. London's top hedge fund duo - Noam Gottesman and Pierre Lagrange of GLG Partners - each took home $350m in 2007, according to Alpha Magazine, an industry publication. Gottesman recently sold his six-storey townhouse in London's Mayfair to steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal for \u00a3117m. When asked the secret of his success, he once replied \"paranoia\".</p> <p><strong>4 Raise some money</strong></p> <p>This is the tricky bit. You will need \u00a350m at the very least to have any kind of credibility. It helps if you have private wealth or rich, trusting friends. In Britain, hedge funds are not allowed to advertise directly to the public so much of the fund-raising is done behind closed doors through contacts, conferences and presentations. Good relations with City and Wall Street banks are essential - in return for brokerage business, firms such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley will often arrange introductions for hedge funds to potential investors. It is wise to accept money only from extremely well-off people. The last thing you want is to have clients pestering you every day because their entire savings are tied up in your fund. In the US, only individuals with assets of $1m or an annual income of more than $200,000 are allowed to invest in hedge funds.</p> <p><strong>5 Rent an office </strong></p> <p>Mayfair is a good spot. It's handy for a lunchtime plate of yellowtail tuna at Nobu. Rents can be as high as \u00a390 per sq ft, compared with an average of \u00a365 in the Square Mile, which means premises of 2,000ft for a fledgling fund will cost \u00a3180,000 per year. Joshua Gilbery, a commercial property consultant, says hedgies want \"class A\" premises with raised floors, suspended ceilings, a concierge and acres of space. \"There might be only four or five chaps in a hedge fund office but they have so much money that it doesn't make much difference. These guys will have big, huge desks and lots of screens.\" Greenwich, Connecticut, has become a global hedge fund capital - it is home to more than 380 firms. The wealthier hedgies live in sprawling palaces with ice rinks, private cinemas and ballrooms and some commute by speedboat. Mike Tedesco, a local estate agent, can find you something top-class for $150 per sq ft, more than twice the typical Manhattan rent of $60 to $65. </p> <p><strong>6 Recruit some staff</strong></p> <p>Fund managers should be easy to find given the number of people recently laid off by Bear Stearns, Citigroup, Merrill Lynch and other banks suffering fallout from the global credit crunch. One pin-striped banker in New York has even taken to wandering around with a sandwich board declaring \"experienced MIT graduate available for hire\". Your back office and accounting functions can be contracted out to the many firms specialising in servicing the hedge fund industry. Scott Epstein, US head of HSBC's alternative fund services arm, says his staff can do your book-keeping, maintain your shareholder register, send out monthly statements to investors and do any regulatory paperwork. But you will have to be vetted first. \"When we look at clients, we go through a very, very robust process of due diligence,\" says Epstein. \"It's very much establishing a relationship with a counterparty - both parties want to be confident it's going to be comfortable mutually.\"</p> <p><strong>7 Choose an approach </strong> </p> <p>Do you want to be a \"quant\" or a fundamental? The most hi-tech operators on the block are quantitative funds, which use highly complex software to trade at lightning speed. Buying and selling by the second, their programs <br>pick up trends in prices that are often imperceptible to the naked eye. Their software will process variables such as companies' earnings ratios and price history to determine what to buy - or they might pounce on tiny discrepancies between the price of the same stock on different stockmarkets. The downside is that when the market takes a knock, the quants' machine-driven trading can cause chaos. Last year, one Goldman Sachs fund lost a third of its value in a week - a drop of $1.8bn - as a \"herd mentality\" prompted scores of quant programs to dump stocks simultaneously. More traditional-style funds with a \"fundamental\" approach spend time researching the prospects of companies, currencies and commodities. They might take the time to talk to analysts, meet corporate management and attend shareholders' meetings.</p> <p><strong>8 Adopt a strategy</strong> </p> <p>The classic hedge fund is called a \"long/short\", which means it takes straightforward positions to bet on different shares going either up or down. In addition to buying shares that you think will rise, you can \"short\" those you expect to fall. This is done by borrowing shares from a broker and selling them on the open market, in the expectation that you will be able to buy them back for a lower price and return them to the owner, pocketing a tidy profit on the way. During an FSA clampdown this summer on traders, Odey Asset Management was outed as one of several funds shorting shares in the troubled Bradford &amp; Bingley. Other strategies are more sophisticated. A \"convertible arbitrage\" fund finds and exploits discrepancies in pricing. A \"distressed debt\" approach involves high-risk dealing in struggling companies, while a \"global macro\" fund bases its decisions on broader economic calls. An \"event driven\" strategy means watching the news carefully - after an air crash, for example, these funds might short airline stocks and in the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami, some attempted to invest in Sri Lankan construction firms. </p> <p><strong>9 Accessorise </strong></p> <p>As the money rolls in, it is a good idea to install quirky diversions to make sure your big-brained staff don't get restless and leave. One American fund, Pequot, boasts a basketball court beside its trading floor. Aquariums, <br>waterfalls, pinball machines and games rooms are useful symbols of quirkiness and success. Art is an obvious way to spend all your profits. One of the world's top hedgies, SAC Capital founder Stevie Cohen, has amassed a <br>collection which includes works by Van Gogh, Gauguin, Warhol, Lichtenstein, Manet and Jackson Pollock - not to mention Damien Hirst's shark pickled in formaldehyde.</p> <p><strong>10 Hope for the best</strong></p> <p>It could, of course, all go horribly wrong. Although 1,152 new funds opened for business last year, Hedge Fund Research reckons that 563 funds shut down. As many as one in five funds fail within their first year. And the strain can be telling - therapists in New York reported an increase of 25% in enquiries from distraught Wall Street workers towards the end of last year as the markets went crazy.</p>",
  "<p>It has been called one of North America's wildest places. Just north of the US-Canada border, the wooded slopes of the Canadian Rockies channel unpolluted water into a valley that remains free of human development. Grizzly bears, cougars and wolverines prowl the banks of the Flathead river. Outside of a national park, there is probably no wilderness like it on the continent.</p> <p>But outside of a national park could mean outside of legal protection. Somewhere in the workings of the British Columbia government, an application from global energy company BP is working its way around civil servants' desks. In it, the firm outlines a proposal that has horrified local environmentalists: the installation of up to 1,500 gas wells covering an area of 500 sq km (310 sq miles) amid the lush 1,580 sq km wilderness of the Flathead. Some time during the next six months, officials may give approval to the project.</p> <p>\"There have to be some places on the planet where you don't go for energy production,\" says Jack Stanford, a biologist at the nearby University of Montana. \"This is one of them.\"</p> <p>Stanford's fascination with the region has spanned 40 years of his scientific career. When he describes the valley, it's easy to see why. To the north lie the mountainous Banff and Jasper national parks. The 4,500 sq km Waterton Glacier International Peace Park straddles the border just south of the river. All these great wildernesses have been declared world heritage sites by Unesco.</p> <p><strong>Isolated populations</strong></p> <p>The Flathead valley connects the protected areas, allowing hundreds of bears and thousands of moose to roam between the parks. Sixteen species of carnivore live in the region, a higher density than anywhere in North America. Without a corridor, animals in the parks would become more isolated, inbred and vulnerable to disease. \"The grizzlies would gradually decline and disappear,\" warns Stanford.</p> <p>Unfortunately for those animals, their route between parks covers mountains that hold valuable fossil fuel deposits. Around a kilometre below the Flathead river region lies the Crowsnest Coalfield. According to BP's initial estimates, the field holds enough natural gas for half a century of drilling. When operating at peak, it should produce over 14m cubic metres of fuel a day, more than enough to supply the 2 million people that live in Vancouver and surrounding parts of British Columbia.</p> <p>Fossil fuel drilling is never a pretty process, but environmental groups are particularly wary of projects that aim to extract methane from coal seams. Large volumes of salt water flow up the well with the gas and have to be disposed of, for example. The liquid is so saline that it can pollute land and kill fish if allowed to enter rivers.</p> <p>Coalbed methane drilling is also land intensive. Erin Sexton, a colleague of Stanford's who has studied similar projects in other parts of North America, says energy companies typically install 40 wells on every sq km of a coalbed methane project. Along with the wells come roads and pipelines. \"They have taken natural landscapes and turned them into industrial sites,\" she says.</p> <p>None of these concerns will be news to BP, which has stressed that detailed environmental studies are needed before any work begins. Hejdi Feick, a spokeswoman for the company, says the British Columbia government decision refers only to tenure, a legal status that would give BP the right to apply for drilling permits. If that's granted, the company will continue with ongoing environmental studies for at least three years before beginning commercial production. The firm also says water from the seam will be pumped back into underground reservoirs and that it plans to have only around three wells per sq km.</p> <p>Some local environmentalists have praised BP for its willingness to engage with local concerns and its commitment to study the area. But when it comes to details of how the projects may be implemented, differences of opinion arise.</p> <p>Sexton wants the company to commit to a five-year moratorium on drilling activities. That is the time she feels is needed to conduct a detailed survey of the region's waters, vegetation and wildlife. Only last year, a new species of fish was discovered in the area, she says. </p> <p>But Feick would not rule out exploratory drilling while the environmental studies were still under way. She adds that the company is \"committed to doing this project right\" and may still decide not to proceed. </p> <p>But thousands of miles to the south of the Flathead, rancher Tweeti Blancett questions such assurances. Blancett used to run cattle over 200 sq km in Aztec, New Mexico. Her husband's grandfather leased land to the energy companies in the 1950s, but it was not until coalbed methane wells arrived in the 80s that problems started.</p> <p>Blancett says saline water often spills from wells and tankers. If the spill runs into a gulley, it wipes out all vegetation in its path. She claims that spills of polluted water or drilling fluids sometimes take weeks to be cleared up and government oversight of the firms is too lightweight to make much difference. Around three years ago, she decided the land was too polluted and moved her cattle.</p> <p>A BP spokesman disputed Blancett's claims, saying her description of the coalbed methane project was \"not consistent with the facts as we know them\".</p> <p>In the Flathead, meanwhile, BP has to contend with a well-organised group representing a dozen organisations from both sides of the US-Canada border. The Flathead Coalition was first formed when coal mining began in neighbouring Elk Valley in the 70s, says Dave Haddon, the coalition's director. Its strength stems from its diverse membership, which includes local landowners, environmentalists and biologists. </p> <p><strong>Broad objective</strong></p> <p>Not everyone agrees on everything. Some landowners have no interest in designating new wilderness areas, for instance. But Haddon says the group reaches consensus by focusing on the broad objective of preventing inappropriate development in the region.</p> <p>With that diversity of interests behind him, Haddon has more of an impact than niche groups with tighter focuses. This April, for example, he met with the managers of nine investment funds that own substantial amounts of BP stock. Haddon says BP has so far declined to share documents relating to its environmental studies and that the managers might pressure BP into being more transparent about its plans for the region. The coalition is also asking Unesco to declare the Flathead a world heritage site.</p> <p>\"The coalition gives us the chance to increase the volume and to represent ourselves as mainstream,\" says Casey Brennan of Wildsight, a local environmental organisation that is part of the coalition.</p> <p>Asked if the coalition would allow any amount of coalbed methane drilling, Haddon admits that the issue is tricky. The coalition position is that development can take place, provided BP has adequate plans in place to protect the valley's flora and fauna. But the words Haddon uses to describe the Flathead - a \"cornucopia for wildlife\", a fragile corridor that could easily be \"severed\" - makes clear his concern about any threat to what makes the area unique.</p> <p>Other coalition members are more blunt. Brennan says: \"I don't think this can go ahead. This area is far too valuable. There is a saying in business: 'If you want to make omelettes you have to break eggs.' We don't want to be those eggs.\"</p>",
  "<p>In the past decade, home buyers have paid the government \u00a332bn in stamp duty, with the annual amount rising dramatically as the housing market soared and increasing numbers of properties were caught by the tax.</p> <p>According to the Halifax, just over a quarter of the privately-owned homes in the UK, more than 5.5m, were valued above \u00a3250,000 at the end of last year, the threshold at which stamp duty is levied at 3% of the property's value. In 2002, there were just 1.8m properties valued above \u00a3250,000.</p> <p>A family buying the average-priced home in Greater London, currently \u00a3291,500, would pay the Treasury \u00a38,745 in tax.</p> <p>The government has enjoyed a large increase in revenue from stamp duty since Labour came to power in 1997. That year, the yield from residential properties was just \u00a3675m. Increases in the rate of tax combined with the impact of rising house prices meant the Treasury collected \u00a36.4bn from stamp duty on homes last year. However, that figure will fall dramatically this year as the housing market has hit a wall and the number of transactions has plummeted to record lows.</p> <p>Under the current regime, there are four stamp duty bands. Buyers of homes worth less than \u00a3125,000 pay nothing. Between \u00a3125,000 and \u00a3250,000, buyers pay 1% on the price of the home; between \u00a3250,000 and \u00a3500,000, buyers pay 3% of the price; and above \u00a3500,000, they pay 4%. There were 1m properties in the UK valued at more than \u00a3500,000 at the end of last year, a threefold increase in the past five years, according to the Halifax.</p> <p>Consumer groups, mortgage lenders and house builders have lobbied for the lifting of the current thresholds to keep them in line with rising house prices, and those calls have become louder as the housing market has been paralysed by the credit crunch. First-time buyers are under particular pressure as the banks' lending criteria have become tougher and they are being forced to find much larger deposits.</p> <p>If the higher stamp duty thresholds of \u00a3250,000 and \u00a3500,000 had increased in line with house price inflation since July 1997 when they were introduced, they would now stand at \u00a3720,000 and \u00a31.44m, the Halifax said.</p> <p>If the chancellor goes ahead with either a deferment or tax holiday, it would not be the first time that stamp duty has been temporarily suspended to get the housing market moving again and, opponents might suggest, to score political points during desperate times. Stamp duty on properties under \u00a3250,000 was suspended temporarily for nine months in 1991-92 by the Conservative chancellor Norman Lamont in an attempt to thaw out the housing market ahead of the general election.</p> <p>Under the Conservatives, there was a flat rate of 1% in stamp duty, payable on properties valued at more than \u00a360,000.</p> <p>Economists and industry bodies suggested that a stamp duty holiday would help the housing market but stressed that additional measures were still needed. Howard Archer, an economist at Global Insight, said any temporary scrapping or deferment of the tax would have only a \"limited\" impact on the housing market. \"The problems relating to affordability and tight lending conditions run pretty deep,\" he said. \"Probably the main help it would provide is in helping first-time buyers coming up with the deposit they need to buy a house.\"</p> <p>He also questioned the impact on government finances. \"They are in such a mess at the moment, you wonder if they can afford it,\" he said.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Council of Mortgage Lenders welcomed a possible reform of the tax. \"In a weakening housing market, stamp duty acts as a material disincentive to moving and reforms would help first-time buyers and the wider housing market.\" But he said the move failed to address the lack of mortgage financing available. \"Removing stamp duty only addresses buyer confidence, not the wider problems in the financial markets.\"</p> <p>A recent analysis by the Halifax illustrates the increasing burden of stamp duty on home buyers. Across the UK, home buyers last year paid average stamp duty of \u00a31,971, representing 7% of average full time earnings. In 2002, the average stamp duty bill was \u00a31,211, the equivalent of 5% of earnings in that year.</p> <p>In 2000, the government raised the rate of tax for the \u00a3250,000-plus band from 1.5% to the current 3%, while for the \u00a3500,000-plus threshold, the levy was doubled from 2% to 4%. The Treasury has moved to ease the burden on lower-income families, raising the lowest level of stamp duty from \u00a360,000 to \u00a3120,000 in the 2005 budget. The threshold was raised again to \u00a3125,000 a year later.</p>",
  "<p>The attractions of an easy life are lost on Debbie Flood. The Yorkshire-born oarswoman has spent the past 11 years living the uniquely ascetic life of an international rower and chasing dreams of Olympic glory. In 2004 in Athens she was rewarded with a silver medal in the quadruple sculls. Later this month in the same boat she hopes to be part of the first British women's crew to return from an Olympic regatta bearing gold.</p> <p>Win or lose in Beijing, at the end of the season the 28-year-old will set aside her athletic ambitions for 12 months, trading Lycra and dawn training for a prison officer's uniform and early shifts on the wings. Flood plans to spend a year working full-time for the prison service before going part-time in 2010 to give herself a shot at competing at the London Olympics.</p> <p>It is a singular career departure for an international athlete but Flood is a singular competitor. She was raised in a sporty, Christian family in Yorkshire and as a teenager was good enough at judo to be selected for the national youth squad.</p> <p>She excelled at athletics too but it was a casual session on a rowing machine at her marathon-running father's gym that revealed a life-changing aptitude for rowing. Encouraged by her father to explore her potential, a summer course with Tideway Scullers at Eton College aged 16 confirmed a rare athletic ability and she has devoted herself to the sport ever since.</p> <p>She is equally committed to her faith, and is a vocal member of Christians In Sport, an organisation that works to overcome the coyness about religion that is characteristic of British sport.</p> <p>Speaking on the day her selection for Beijing was confirmed at the team's training base at Caversham, she beamed with the sort of healthy wellbeing that comes courtesy of years of self-denial and a training regime requiring total commitment, and explained the inspiration for her unlikely career change.</p> <p>\"When I came back from Athens I ended up going into a lot of school visits, doing assemblies and talks and I got it into my heart that I would like to work with kids,\" she said.</p> <p>\"I started doing mentoring work with kids who were three or four years below where they should have been academically. I would sit in the class and there would be disruptive kids and I thought, well of course you have to chuck them out of the class because they are disrupting the others, but what do you do with them then?</p> <p>\"I decided then that I wanted to work with disruptive kids in some form. I think it is either something you can or you can't cope with, so I decided to put myself in the most extreme position that I could so I did some work at a young offenders' institution. I realised I could cope with it, so I decided to try it full-time.\"</p> <p>Clearly her faith has played a part in enabling her to cope the rigours of such a demanding profession. She is unabashed about her belief and discusses it with a frankness not always heard from athletes of faith.</p> <p>\"My faith is really important to me. I look back on my life and see that I have been put in these places which appear to be random, but as I see it I have found something that I am really good at and God has put me here as a witness for him. He has got my life in his hands and this is where he is taking me,\" she said.</p> <p>\"I'm quite lucky, everyone in my team knows that I am a Christian but they see that I am just a normal person, I get on with my rowing, I train hard, I'm not strange because I'm a Christian but I believe in God and it's a big part of my life.\"</p> <p>Before Flood departs for the cell blocks there is the question of whether she and her three team-mates can finally end Britain's wait for a women's gold. They are part of the first British team in 24 years to attend an Olympic regatta without Sir Steve Redgrave or Matthew Pinsent in its ranks, and there is a strong desire among the class of '08 to establish a legacy of their own.</p> <p>They are fancied by many, Redgrave included, to win gold and on present form and their record since Athens they have an outstanding chance.</p> <p>Two of the present squad - Frances Houghton and Flood - collected silver medals in the boat in 2004 alongside Alison Mowbray and Rebecca Romero. Mowbray has since retired and Romero is now a cycling medal prospect here. They were replaced by Annie Vernon and Katherine Grainger - who won a silver medal in the coxless pair in Athens.</p> <p>The replacements have helped maintain the team's competitiveness and in 2006 and 2007 they were world champions. They have been defeated in a World Cup regatta by the Chinese this season but remain favourites for gold.</p> <p>The expectation does not appear to hang heavy. \"There is a lot of pressure on us but the internal pressure we put on ourselves and each other in the crew is just as significant,\" Flood said.</p> <p>\"We expect 100% from each other. That's the sort of pressure we are used to every day and every year. The external pressure from the press, from friends and family and the supporters is not something we are used to and we are going to have to learn to deal with that and use it.\"</p> <p>Flood will take her seat at No2 in the boat only after a protracted battle with Sarah Winckless, now a member of the women's eight, that is typical of the internal competition fostered by the performance director David Tanner. All winter the candidates for Olympic boats have been racing one another in single sculls, being constantly monitored to identify the fastest, strongest oarswomen. Flood has relished the competitive environment.</p> <p>\"I've been fighting for this seat since October and it's been up and down because you never have a perfect winter, but it's really good for the team to have competition and to have people snapping at your heels,\" she said.</p> <p>Should Flood and her team-mates be successful in Beijing it will have less to do with divine inspiration than worldly graft. Rowers follow a testing regime training six hours a day in all weathers with little prospect of fame and fortune at the end of it. The goal is glory and for Flood that is more than enough, particularly if it establishes British women as a world force in the sport.</p> <p>\"People see the races on TV and think 'That must be hard' but they don't see the work that goes into it. We train in all weathers seven days a week with just three weeks a year off after the summer. We don't have weekends, we don't have lie-ins, we train in the sun and the wind and the rain and the hail and it is not easy.</p> <p>\"And then it all comes down to one race, and you have to get it right. In a sense I will have been training for 11 years for one six-minute race. How much more pressure can you get than that?\"</p> <h2>On a Redgrave mission</h2> <p>Steve Redgrave, Britain's five-time Olympic champion, has two reasons for wanting to see the women's quad triumph in Beijing. Firstly, he believes a women's gold would give his sport a huge fillip in Britain. His second motivation is more personal, as one of the GB quad's chief rivals for gold is the German crew led by the four-time Olympic champion Kathrin Boron. The German won three of her medals in a pair (1992, 2000 and 2004) and one in the quad (1996) and a repeat would give Boron a fifth gold to match Redgrave's famous career haul. </p> <p>\"I'm extremely excited about the quad's prospects but it is going to be tough. They are co-favourites with the Chinese, and the Germans will come out stronger than they did at the last World Cup races,\" said Redgrave, adding with a smile: \"You have Kathrin Boron in the German quad and she is going for her fifth Olympic gold medal, so it's very important they don't win.\"</p> <p>Happily, Redgrave believes Debbie Flood and her team-mates can protect his record by taking the gold. \"Women's rowing in Britain needs a gold medal to underline its growing strength,\" he said. \"The first time it was in the Games was 1976 but we didn't get a medal until 2000.\"</p>",
  "<p>Americans do it clean, Britons do it dirty. Americans have term limits on high office. Their contestants come out in the open, take off their shirts and fight to known rules. They say who they are and what they represent. The people then decide. </p> <p>Monday's headline read: \"Blairites plot to hasten prime minister's exit.\" Forgive me, but what business is it of theirs? For the second time in just over a year, Britain must contemplate a small political club choosing a new ruler without so much as a passing reference to the electorate. We read of cabals and cliques at Westminster, uttering squeals and burps, for the interpretation of which we rely on an inner priesthood of lobby journalists. We read nothing of elections. </p> <p>The club behaves like all British clubs. Members murmur in corridors, squeeze arms, write nuanced articles and give opaque interviews. Friendship is poisoned by ambition, because this electoral college is composed exclusively of \"friends\". Treason can take wing since, \"If it prosper, none dare call it treason\". </p> <p>Last week the foreign secretary, David Miliband, stepped forward as the new Michael Heseltine to Gordon Brown's Margaret Thatcher. One more politician believes he can cheat the curse that he who wields the dagger never wears the crown. Miliband's article in these pages, with its much commented-upon failure to mention Brown, must have been a shard of steel in the latter's heart. Rarely can one omitted name have carried such savage import. </p> <p>With the equilibrium of cabinet loyalty thus disturbed, Brown's colleagues are liberated to perform patricide in their or her own peculiar way. Once the assassin has broken cover, this customarily takes the form of showering the victim with support that suggests not only that he badly needs it but that he cannot rely on it for long. When a man so recently anointed is described by his three closest colleagues as \"unquestionably the best man to lead us into the next election\", the questions raised are, why those three, why say it now, and why the silence from the rest? Uneasy indeed lies the head that wears the crown. </p> <p>A fiction of British politics is that, unlike in presidential systems, leadership is subsumed in party. Elections are meant to be choices between policy pantechnicons. But choosing the leader assigned the task of delivering these options is not a matter for the electorate, or even for the public gaze. Leadership selection in Britain is performed by consenting adults in private.</p> <p>This no longer makes democratic sense, if it ever did. The growth and acceptance of the welfare state and Thatcher's \"change\" revolution have closed the policy gap between the parties. The language and gimmicks bandied about Westminster are so interchangeable as to be the source of mirth in the Commons. Meanwhile the role of personality, better called character, is long recognised by the mass marketing of leaders. The perceived failure of John Major, Iain Duncan Smith and Gordon Brown, and the success of Tony Blair and David Cameron, are not attributed to some great divergence of policy. They are put down to qualities of confidence, likability and courtly prominence, summed up in the word charisma. </p> <p>The failure of Brown to live up to the expectation he aroused just a year ago has nothing to do with his ideas or policies. It is due to his lack of public appeal - in a nutshell to his personality. The thesis, much espoused by Guardian contributors, that Brown has totally changed and thus polluted their constancy of judgment, is ludicrous. Their former presentation - indeed, eulogising - of him was plain wrong. </p> <p>No less eccentric is the code now required of the conspirators to bring about Brown's downfall. Miliband's article merits being seen as a set text of this code. Its political content was near zero, an intellectual morass of \"not yielding to fatalism\", being \"humble about shortcomings\" and \"sharing a restlessness for change\". </p> <p>Change has been, for the Blair-Brown ascendancy, the same buzzword that socialism was to an earlier Labour generation, though wholly devoid of meaning. Miliband tossed out a few hostages to fortune, such as support for lower energy bills which, were he an economist, he would know implies higher consumption. He favours windfall utilities taxes and something called \"winning the peace\" in Iraq. </p> <p>But he is a thinktanker rather than an executive breed of politician. He has never shown much understanding of how to make an organisation deliver his ideas. As schools minister he was obsessed with targets and testing, then said he was against them. As environment minister he was for personal carbon credits but did nothing about them. At local government he proclaimed the new localism and \"double devolution\", and did nothing but make speeches. At the Foreign Office he has followed Whitehall's line of least resistance, supporting America's wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. </p> <p>What Miliband is doing and what his colleagues know he is doing is signalling that he is ready not for \"change\" but for leadership. Last year he was indecisive over challenging Brown for the leadership. He knows what dithering cost Brown in the past, and that politics likes a chancer. </p> <p>Miliband will fight if the opening occurs, and rivals like Jack Straw, Harriet Harman or (my outside bet) John Denham must make dispositions accordingly. While the odds must still be on Brown leading Labour into a 2010 election, the elephant of the cliche is in the room. Another succession race has begun. </p> <p>Democracy is again a bystander. The public's sole participation in this decision is through the proxy of the opinion polls. The code has ordained that Brown is at risk \"unless he succeeds in refreshing the agenda this autumn\". Agenda refreshment means no more than a scattergun of Downing Street task forces and giveaways. What is meant is that Brown must pick up in the polls. </p> <p>If you are one of the lucky 1,200 customarily approached by a pollster and weighted by class, age and sex, a heavy responsibility rests on your shoulders. You have been chosen at random to help the club members decide who should lead Britain. As for whether I think this is a good way of choosing a leader in a democracy, I do not. But then all the constitutional reformers in the world will never persuade me that British politics is not stuck irredeemably in the 18th century.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:simon.jenkins@theguardian.com\">simon.jenkins@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Michael Page saw its shares jump by a third yesterday after it confirmed that it had received a bid approach from its bigger Swiss rival Adecco.</p> <p>Michael Page, one of Britain's biggest recruitment groups, was quick to rebuff the \"unsolicited preliminary approach\" from Adecco, which it said came with a number of conditions. It stressed it had \"excellent prospects\" on its own, adding: \"The board continues to believe that the company has a very strong future as an independent group.\" It prides itself on being the leading global brand in office recruitment, with 166 offices in 28 countries. </p> <p>Shares in Michael Page leapt by 86.75p to 352p, giving the company a market value of \u00a31.1bn. Market speculation has put a price on the company of 350-450p a share. The stock has fallen sharply from about 600p a year ago as the economy worsened. The news also boosted shares in other staffing firms such as Hays, which climbed 11% to 90p. </p> <p>Adecco - the biggest recruitment company in the world with a presence in 60 countries - confirmed its approach. \"Adecco's stated strategy is to expand its professional operations in the US, Europe and Asia as well as looking at specialised general staffing companies,\" it added. \"Discussions are at an early stage.\"</p> <p>Whereas Adecco focuses on blue-collar recruitment, Michael Page was founded in 1976 as a specialist recruiter in the financial sector.</p> <p>Some analysts expressed surprise at the news. \"A deal of this size at this stage of the cycle is something of a brave move,\" said Panmure's Paul Jones.</p>",
  "<p>The energy company at the centre of a row over the proposed new Kingsnorth coal-fired power station is pushing ahead to finalise new building contracts, despite its insistence in public that it has put plans on hold until ministers complete a consultation on \"clean coal\" schemes, documents seen by the Guardian show.</p> <p>Officials at the department of business who are handling the controversial plant have also completed a revised set of draft planning conditions for the German firm E.ON which make no reference to carbon capture and storage (CCS), news that has angered environmentalists. </p> <p>The revelations are disclosed in an exchange of emails between the company and government officials, as activists take part in a week of protests against the coal-fired unit. They want to halt plans by E.ON UK to replace the existing Kingsnorth plant. Medway council has approved the scheme, and the final decision will be made by the government.</p> <p>A note written by Doug Waters, the senior development engineer for E.ON on the Kingsnorth project, to Mohammed Gary, a civil servant at the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, calls for a meeting to discuss planning conditions relating to construction \"as we are looking to finalise contracts\".</p> <p>The email is dated May 12, six weeks after Paul Golby, the chief executive of E.ON UK, told ministers to defer making a decision on planning permission until after a consultation on clean coal schemes and the use of CCS, which is intended to trap greenhouse gases.</p> <p>Last night, E.ON said it was natural for a company to proceed with as much work as it could before a final decision was made on how CCS would be organised, and on the wider question of whether new coal-fired power stations would be allowed.</p> <p>Asked why some planning consent documents did not make reference to the clean coal process, a company spokesman said: \"There are many parts of a power station that you can build, such as the boiler house and turbines, that have nothing to do with CCS.\"</p> <p>The business department said: \"This draft document should not be viewed as signalling anything about our intention to require carbon capture readiness if consent were to be granted to E.ON.\"</p> <p>But Greenpeace claimed last night that it was significant that revised planning consents had been drawn up with no reference to CCS, or even to climate change. </p> <p>Ben Stewart, communications director at Greenpeace, said: \"They reveal an extra level of collusion between the government and Britain's biggest single carbon emitter.

  "<p>The Federal Reserve warned last night that financial markets remained under heavy pressure as it announced it was holding US interest rates at 2%.</p> <p>Despite concerns about inflationary pressure, America's central bank cited rising unemployment and a plunging housing market as its reasons for leaving borrowing costs unchanged. That decision and a continuing drop in oil prices sent equities indices on both sides of the Atlantic down by almost 3% yesterday.</p> <p>Wall Street had feared that the Fed might start to reverse the sharp easing of rates in response to a rising cost of living in the world's biggest economy, but only one member of the bank's open-market committee favoured higher rates.</p> <p>The Fed said the cut in its fed funds rate from 5.25% a year ago would eventually help underpin the economy, but expected only a modest pick-up in activity.</p> <p>\"Economic activity expanded in the second quarter, partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports. However, labour markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress.

Over time, the substantial easing of monetary policy, combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity, should help to promote moderate economic growth,\" the Fed said.</p> <p>Last night's announcement followed a survey showing that activity in the US service sector stagnated in July. Manufacturing is also struggling to grow, while unemployment has been rising.</p> <p>The Fed has expressed concern in recent months about rising inflation prompted by higher global food and fuel prices, but yesterday's fall in oil prices left them almost $30 below their peak of last month.</p> <p>\"Inflation has been high, spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities, and some indicators of inflation expectations have been elevated,\" it said yesterday. \"The committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year, but the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain. Although downside risks to growth remain, the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee.\"</p> <p>The promise by producers' cartel Opec to raise output, an easing of the nuclear row between the US and oil-rich Iran, and the prospect of reduced demand from western economies pushed down prices. </p> <p>Other commodities such as copper, gold and platinum also fell, hit by expectations that slower economic growth would limit demand and, as the dollar rose, making commodities priced in the US currency more expensive.

  "<p>Drax has seen its profits plunge by almost half as it pays the price for running the UK's biggest single carbon polluting power station in an era of rising CO2 prices.</p> <p>Last year Drax, the owner of the 4,000 megawatt (MW) coal-fired plant in North Yorkshire, which supplies about 7% of the country's electricity, spent \u00a311m buying CO2 emission allowances to cover its carbon pollution. </p> <p>But the company has already spent \u00a3107m this year under a second phase of the European emissions trading scheme (ETS) when its allocation was reduced. </p> <p>The higher cost of acquiring carbon credits helped cut pre-tax profits from \u00a3273m in the first six months of 2007 to \u00a3150m this time round and Drax admits full-year earnings will be considerably lower than before. Additional costs to the group came from the rising cost of its basic feedstock coal, which was 34% higher at \u00a323.6 a megawatt hour.</p> <p>The company, which plans to hand out \u00a350m to shareholders in dividends despite the profit slump, is now looking to increase the amount of plant-based fuel it burns alongside coal.</p> <p>The company banged the drum yesterday in favour of Britain building more coal-fired power stations despite deepening worries about climate change.</p> <p>Dorothy Thompson, (below) chief executive of Drax, said the UK still needed more coal-fired generation because neither nuclear nor wind provided the kind of \"variable\" power that was needed for a constant supply of electricity. </p> <p>\"I firmly believe that long term, coal will be a key component to global energy supply,\" she explained .</p> <p>The whole debate around coal-fired power stations has become increasingly fractious with climate campaigners protesting at the Kingsnorth site in Kent where the German-owned utility E.ON wants to build a new 1,600MW facility, with or without clean coal technology.</p> <p>Thompson, whose Drax plant near Selby was the target of a similar demonstration last year, said she was convinced that \"clean coal\" - using carbon capture and storage - was technologically within reach. The only question remained at what price it could be done.</p> <p>Despite her enthusiasm for coal, Thompson said she was looking at providing 500MW of output from a broad range of sustainable sources, up from a previous target of 400MW. </p> <p>She said biomass was not as cheap as burning coal but it reduced CO2 emissions, adding: \"I am confident we will earn a sufficient economic return on the investment.\" The technology for burning higher amounts of biomass will be ready by June 2010, later than a previous target of 2009.</p> <p>The company is building a straw pellet plant in Yorkshire and considering further similar facilities, while also burning elephant grass, wood off-cuts and peanut husks. </p> <p>Thompson said she would consider burning more crop-based fuels if there were not government caps on coal-fired power stations doing so. Drax has itself been looking at expanding outside of the coal arena by considering whether to buy gas-fired power stations but recently turned down the chance to buy a facility on Teesside because it was deemed too expensive.</p> <p>Analysts at Deutsche Bank noted the lower financial results but said it remained positive about the future. \"Drax is now facing higher prices for CO2, while receiving less free credits, following the start of phase 2 of the EU ETS. However, the outlook for Drax has improved substantially over the last 6-12 months, with higher oil prices more than offsetting the impact of higher coal prices and leading to higher forward margins for Drax,\" they said.</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p>The collapse in half-year profits at Drax, the UK's biggest single <strong>carbon polluter</strong>, is proof that the European Union's <strong>emission trading scheme</strong> (ETS) is working better. The owner of the North Yorkshire coal-fired electricity generator, run by Dorothy Thompson, pictured, saw the allocations it received under the scheme reduced, obliging it to pay more to cover its emissions.</p> <p>A second phase of the ETS came into force at the start of the year, three years after the first - much criticised - phase got under way. It was widely deemed to have been far <strong>too lenient</strong>.</p> <p>Installations in the energy and industrial sectors obtain a ration of <strong>free allowances</strong> and must buy any more they need on the open market, where the price of carbon has been rising. The current scheme, which runs till <strong>2012</strong>, still covers only half of all EU emissions of CO2.</p>",
  "<p>Remember what we were told when Northern Rock was nationalised: the bank's loan book was of good quality and the sum owed to the Bank of England would be repaid by 2010. Six months on, holes are appearing in both boasts.</p> <p>Consider the \u00a33bn of debt that will be swapped into equity, plus the \u00a3400m of preference shares to be converted into ordinary shares. The charitable view is that the taxpayer's position is not altered one jot. On this theory, it doesn't much matter how the cake is divided to satisfy regulators since the government is already both debtor and owner.</p> <p>That, presumably, was what Ron Sandler, Northern Rock's chairman, meant when he said that \"at the end of the day, it [the equity capital] will be recouped through the ultimate value of the bank\".</p> <p>But the phrase \"at the end of the day\" jars. Equity capital doesn't have to be repaid, or turned into cash through a sale of Northern Rock, at any particular point. The effect of yesterday's manoeuvre could be to expose the taxpayer to the Rock for far longer than advertised.</p> <p>Indeed, the position is worse: that \u00a33.4bn will be capital at risk. The figure is enormous. HBOS - a bank many times the size of Northern Rock - needed \u00a34bn through a rights issue. Alliance &amp; Leicester has agreed to sell itself to Santander for \u00a31.25bn. Northern Rock may be being prudent in opting for a big number (because state aid can only be handed out once) but the other interpretation is that Sandler &amp; Co expect bad debts to explode.</p> <p>You can see why they may be fearful. A quarter of the Northern Rock's loan book comprises its infamous 125% Together mortgages. These accounted for 70% of repossessions in the first half and the contrast between the two parts of Northern Rock's loan book is stark: arrears on the non-Together mortgages stood at a commendable 0.8% at the end of June, but topped 2.0% on the Together loans. That's alarming. A quality loan book? No.</p> <p><strong>Dull but worth it</strong></p> <p>Where is the crisis in the life insurance industry? Shouldn't these guys have been dragged into the pit by now? That's the way it has worked in the past. Indeed, the insurers served up their very own crisis during 2002 and 2003, when their businesses were exposed as geared bets on stockmarkets, which were plunging. As with the banks now, rights issues followed.</p> <p>This time, the insurers appear to have escaped. You would struggle to know there was a financial crisis at all from a cursory reading of Legal &amp; General's impressive half-year figures yesterday. New business was up 8% and operating profit rose.</p> <p>It is only when you reach post-tax profits, where the likes of L&amp;G must account for investment variances, that you see a big fall - from profits of \u00a3672m to just \u00a356m. But such swings are inevitable under the accounting rules for investments. L&amp;G's response was to increase its dividend by 7.5% and promise to complete its \u00a31bn share buyback programme; it says it is supremely confident in the resilience of its business.</p> <p>Is it right to be so unconcerned? Probably. The good news story about the insurance industry is that it appears to have learned the lessons of 2003. It has run in the opposite direction to the banks, avoiding risky assets and leverage, and removing financial products with guaranteed returns.</p> <p>Morgan Stanley's analysts calculated the other day that the insurance sector would not have to raise new capital even under a \"shock\" scenario in which equities fell by 30%, property values by 20% and corporate bonds defaulted at the highest rate since 1970. It read like a prescription for how banks must build their businesses in future.</p> <p>It sounds terribly dull, but that's the point. The reward, in L&amp;G's case, is a solid dividend yield of almost 6%. That's the sort of dullness investors should embrace.</p> <p><strong>Oil pressure</strong></p> <p>Get ready for oil at $200 a barrel, a few were saying in June. Well, maybe not before we visit $100 again. The fall from $147 to $119 in little more than a month is a serious move. It prompts thoughts of the dramatic collapse in the price of wheat after its peak last December: the price halved in six months.</p> <p>Clearly, speculators - in a move encouraged by US financial regulators - are being chased away, but the deeper reason for the fall lies with our old friends, supply and demand. Saudi Arabia is increasing production and the global economy is weakening. If the Saudis continue to be so helpful, $100 looks more than likely. A year ago - the unofficial start of the credit crunch - the price was $70 a barrel.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:nils.pratley@theguardian.com\">nils.pratley@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Profiling the award-winning environmental campaign work of Archbishop Bartholomew of Constantinople, spiritual leader of 300 million Orthodox Christians, Riazat Butt asks if religion can help prevent eco-catastrophe (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jun/18/activists.environment\">The pope of hope</a>, June 18). After all, as the archbishop told Butt: \"Religious people were indifferent, or even hostile, to science. Scientists and ecologists could see little relationship between their world and the world of faith.\"</p> <p>At a global environment conference in London last year, my professional institution, the Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management, brought together representatives of all the major faiths. There was one matter on which they all agreed: the need to collaborate for action on the environment, and especially on climate change. The leadership of Archbishop Bartholomew was seen as a beacon. </p> <p>But faith groups have been silent for too long on this crisis, and should do far more to remind us of our moral duty to restore and protect the fragile ecological balance of the planet. As the archbishop said: \"We are all culpable. Each one of us has a smaller or greater contribution to the deliberate degradation of nature.\"</p> <p>Butt, in reporting the environmentalism of some religious leaders, suggests that an ecological coalition of faiths is possible: \"There is hardly a religious leader in the world now who is not preoccupied by the problems of pollution and climate change.\" And it's true. In the last year or so we have seen faith leaders including the Dalai Lama, the Bishop of Liverpool and Pope Benedict step down from the pulpit and speak directly on environmental issues. This is good news and \"God-bothering\" of the sort we need for the 21st century.</p> <p>What the faith groups can offer is a framework - ethical, spiritual, imaginative and intellectual - for the pursuit of all the good that relates to human destiny. Fazlun Khalid, director of the Islamic Foundation for Ecology and Environmental Sciences, has urged faiths to civilise and change behaviour for a fairer, sustainable world. But they must engage with people and evangelise first - heeding Bartholomew's big idea for an economic model that is about replenishment, compassion and nurturing. In other words: it's creation, stupid!</p> <p>In the meantime, as Archbishop Bartholomew warns, cohorts of secularists continue to pursue greedy and harmful lifestyles believing that techno-fix solutions alone will be our salvation. The truth is that blind faith in the ability of technology to sustain a growing global population - hard-wired to materialism - that has already breached environmental limits is bonkers. Faith group leaders must be more vociferous in challenging this - they have unique access to governments and institutions. They must exercise that influence by holding them to account. </p> <p>Religion can help prevent eco-catastrophe. And, as Butt's report argues: \"Religious leaders are in a better position to make an impact on their congregations than politicians or celebrities.\" They have a huge audience and legitimacy over the issue. What are they waiting for?</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Nick Reeves is executive director of the Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management <a href=\"mailto:nick@ciwem.org\">nick@ciwem.org</a></p>",
  "<p>For the last two decades, in an era when coalitions have been the norm in Indian national politics, Harkishan Singh Surjeet, who has died aged 92, the general secretary of the Communist party of India (Marxist) for 13 years till 2005, was a major power-broker. It was a role he described as one of the most trying of his life. In 1989 an anti-Congress party coalition came to power, backed by Surjeet's CPI (M) - but after Congress's Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated in 1991, a Congress-led coalition took over until 1996. Surjeet's CPI (M) then backed two fragile Janata Dal-dominated coalitions (1996-97).</p> <p>A key issue for Surjeet was keeping the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) out of office. The CPI (M) leader was a Sikh, and combating communalism - whether by religion, language, caste or region - was central to his beliefs. The BJP led governing coalitions between 1998 and 1999, and from 1999 to 2004.</p> <p>Surjeet backed the current Congress coalition which came to power in 2004. Indeed, in the vote of confidence debate in the Indian parliament last month on the US-India nuclear deal, Manmohan Singh, the prime minister, thanked him for his support in defeating the BJP.</p> <p>He was born into a small peasant family in Rupowal, a village in eastern Punjab. The region was the epicentre of anti-colonial struggle and, inspired by the socialist revolutionary Bhagat Singh, hanged by the British in 1931, he hoisted the Indian tricolour at the Hoshiarpur district courts on the first anniversary of Bhagat's execution - and was imprisoned until 1934. In the mid-1930s he joined the Communist Party of India (CPI). It was while writing patriotic poetry, and working for Punjabi papers, that he acquired the nom de plume Surjeet (conqueror of the gods).</p> <p>With the outbreak of the second world war, the CPI, following the Moscow line (Stalin had recently concluded his pact with Hitler) denounced the war as imperialist. Leading CPI members were rounded up by the British, including Surjeet, who had gone underground, and detained in Deoli detention camp, Rajasthan. For Surjeet it proved to be an opportunity to study Marxism further.</p> <p>Following the 1941 Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, the CPI's line changed into support for what had now become the \"people's war\" and CPI leaders, including Surjeet, were released in 1942. By 1944 Surjeet was propounding his own thesis for a Sikh homeland on the model of the Pakistan being proposed by the Muslim League. But Surjeet's idea was firmly quashed by Rajani Palme Dutt, the Communist party of Great Britain's chief ideologue, who for many years supervised the CPI on behalf of Stalin's Comintern.</p> <p>By 1952 Surjeet was general secretary the Punjab CPI and was elected to the Punjab legislative assembly (1954-59). But in the early 1960s the Sino-Soviet split in global communism triggered a crisis in the CPI. This was exacerbated in 1962 by the six-week Indo-Chinese war. Many CPI leaders, including Surjeet, backed China and were imprisoned.</p> <p>Two years later a faction including Surjeet broke away to set up the CPI (M). In 1967 Surjeet was elected to the Punjab legislative assembly for the CPI (M), serving until 1972. From 1978 until 1982 he was a member of the Indian parliament's upper house.</p> <p>In later years, ideological fervour within the CPI (M) gave way to pragmatism and business-friendly regional governments. Latterly, with funding from the People's Republic of China drying up, Surjeet's party could rely on support from emigrant British and north American Sikh communities.</p> <p>From the mid-1960s Surjeet visited Britain at least twice a year. In 1966 the CPI (M)-backed Association of Indian Communists was set up in London. He personally supervised its annual elections and those of the Indian Workers' Association (Great Britain).</p> <p>It was as a boy in the early 1960s that I first met Surjeet. As a friend of my father he was a regular visitor to our house in Nakodar in the Punjab. Affable and caring, he never lost his composure even in heated debate: he was a splendid orator in both Punjabi and English.</p> <p>With 43 seats, the CPI (M) that he leaves is the third largest party in India's parliament after Congress (145 seats) and the BJP (138). The CPI has 10. Surjeet was considered the main obstacle to the CPI (M) reuniting with the CPI and his passing may hasten reunification.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife and two sons and a daughter. One daughter predeceased him.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Harkishan Singh Surjeet, politician, born March 23 1916; died August 1 2008</p>",
  "<p>It is a shame that neither Polly Toynbee nor David Walker (Meet the rich, G2, August 4) were sufficiently interested in Ark's work to approach the charity for a comment, choosing instead to take light-hearted comments out of context and to peddle a series of prejudices.</p> <p>For the record, Ark (Absolute Return for Kids) is a charity supported by the financial community, which this year raised \u00a325.8m to spend directly on projects providing HIV/Aids treatment in South Africa, new homes for children previously abandoned to orphanages in Eastern Europe and funding education projects in India and academies in the UK. To date, Ark's programmes have transformed the lives of 65,000 children. The vast majority of those funds came from individual donors, not, as the writers claim, from the sponsors who generously sponsor the dinner.</p> <p>Yes, our press releases thank those who have helped us. That is courtesy, not name-dropping, and I know of no charity that would not act similarly. More pertinently, the authors cite Institute for Public Policy Research findings suggesting that large donors are concerned that the money they donate should be used effectively.</p> <p>That is why Ark's trustees and patrons ensure that Ark's central administrative costs are met so that 100% of donations we receive are used to deliver our programmes. We also rigorously monitor our projects' effectiveness and place considerable emphasis on our accountability to donors and other stakeholders.</p> <p>It seems a shame to belittle those who give up time and money to do so much to help others. That commitment should surely be celebrated and encouraged.<br><strong>Paul Bernstein</strong><br>Managing Director, Ark</p> <p>Another aspect of the arrogance of the rich, not touched on by Toynbee and Walker in the excerpts you print, is their evident insouciance about their impact on global warming. They continue with their mega-carbon lifestyles - think of Dubai - despite the urgency of cuts. Indeed cuts being made by people on ordinary incomes are dwarfed by the carbon footprints of the rich. The richest 10% of households in Britain receive roughly a third of national income, the same as the poorest 70%.</p> <p>If carbon consumption is assumed to be roughly proportional to income then a heroic 20% cut in carbon consumption by the majority is trumped by a 20% income increase by the rich - which is taking place every two or three years. If we are serious about addressing global warming then high incomes need to be drastically cut in the short term.<br><strong>Jamie Gough</strong><br>Sheffield</p> <p>Poet William Langland in the 14th century got there before Toynbee and Walker. The first group Piers Plowman saw in his vision of a \"fair field full of folk\" was the ploughmen who \"played seldom\" and, by working very hard, \"won what wasters gluttonously consume\".</p> <p>The second \"pursued pride, put on proud clothing, / Came all got up in garments garish to see\".</p> <p>He fails to mention bankers offering 125% mortgages. Perhaps that was happening on the other side of the Malverns. <br><strong>Brian Mason</strong><br>Wellington, Shropshire </p> <p>Anyone who doubts the facts in Polly Toynbee and David Walker's article should look at the monthly How to Spend It supplement of the Financial Times. I'd recommend it as required reading for every Labour cabinet minister, if it weren't so eerily adept at persuading one that 18-carat white-yellow gold cufflinks (\u00a32,161) and a ring-lizard clutch bag (\u00a31,470) are prerequisites for the good life.<br><strong>Eva Lawrence</strong><br>St Albans, Hertfordshire</p> <p>Reading Polly Toynbee and David Walker's brilliant article, I was reminded of former Labour chancellor Denis Healy's comment that he would tax \"the rich until the pips squeak\". </p> <p>No one in politics would dare to say anything like that these days.

  "<p>Japanese electronics group Sony is buying its partner Bertelsmann out of their Sony BMG music joint venture, in a deal worth $1.2bn (\u00a3614m) to the German media group.</p> <p>The move could provide privately-held Bertelsmann, whose RTL unit owns British television channel Five, with the financial firepower to buy all or part of BSkyB's controversial 17.9% stake in ITV.</p> <p>The sale, which needs regulatory approval, is part of Bertelsmann boss Hartmut Ostrowski's plan to dispose of under-performing or non-core businesses. </p> <p>Last year, online piracy helped push music sales to their lowest level for a decade, down 8% globally to $19.4bn, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. </p> <p>Sony BMG's sales dropped 4%, to $4.1bn, last year as digital revenues failed to make up for declining sales of CDs. The company, has been aggressively cutting costs and has seen profits more than double to $178m.</p> <p>Bertelsmann is not moving out of music altogether but re-focusing its BMG business on the more lucrative area of rights management. It will take over a number of European music catalogues from Sony BMG including more than 200 artists, who will be distributed by Sony.</p> <p>Sony has been negotiating with Bertelsmann for several months about acquiring full control of Sony BMG, which they created in August 2004 by pooling their music labels.</p> <p>Sony BMG already had $600m in cash on its balance sheet, which was split equally between the two owners.

  "<p>In my second year as the bearer of a British passport, I have come to the perplexing realisation that many of my fellow citizens are departing. Just the other day, a friend of my wife's announced her impending move to New York. My own inner circle of buddies has been decimated by defections to Dubai. The first friend I made at work when I arrived here back in 2001 now calls Melbourne home.</p> <p>On a radio programme last year, the host asked me where I lived before coming to London. When I said Manhattan, he seemed shocked. \"And you moved here?\" was his pitying response. Similarly, during my stints in various British workplaces, I have found myself the recipient of nomadic confessions from even the most outwardly unlikely British colleagues, my own mongrelised status evidently marking me out to them as a trustworthy, or at least sympathetic, confidant.</p> <p>Perhaps I ought not to be so surprised at this. After all, I consider leaving the UK fairly often myself. And the very existence in their current demographic forms of nations such as the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand should have alerted me to a long-standing British fondness for emigration.</p> <p>But having spent the first five years of my life in Britain navigating visa applications, residence requirements, and citizenship tests, I am only now confronting the reality that many people no longer wish to belong to a club that has accepted me as a member. My first instinct was to take this personally. But I had to concede that this trend predated my arrival, indeed the arrival of anyone who looked anything like me, and, moreover, that many of my own friends were caught up in it.</p> <p>At this point another interpretative avenue presented itself. I was reading about British expatriates in India, specifically in Goa, on the BBC website. Apparently these people, who had come in pursuit of the manifest benefits of a sunnier, lower-cost lifestyle and a spicier, more coconut-infused cuisine, were confronting all sorts of problems. Their visas were not being renewed. </p> <p>Their sales and purchases of properties were being interfered with. In short, they were being treated as immigrants are routinely treated all over the world.</p> <p>And I sympathised with them. Knowing nothing about the politics of the situation or the legitimate concerns of the local population (who undoubtedly have good reasons to want their elected officials to make life difficult for the foreigners settling in their midst), my reaction as a brown-skinned man of South Asian origin was to feel a bond of empathy with these pink-skinned people of North Atlantic origin chasing their dreams of new lives in a place far away.</p> <p>Maybe we are all prospective migrants. The lines of national borders on maps are artificial constructs, as unnatural to us as they are to birds flying overhead. Our first impulse is to ignore them. If we stay where we are it is not because the instinct for migration is entirely absent from our nature, but because friends, family, home, opportunity - or fear, laws, inertia, laziness - keep us from moving.</p> <p>For me, as an immigrant, recognising that those already resident in the place to which I have immigrated often themselves wish to emigrate suggests a giant circle of human motion and potential motion of which I am a part. Perhaps, then, the resentment towards recent arrivals felt all over the world is not entirely unrelated to the feelings of a captive songbird for a wandering sparrow who alights on his cage. Of course, this does not rule out the possibility that the songbird is simply thinking, \"There goes the neighbourhood.\"</p> <p><strong>Despite my peripatetic past, I am rather pleased by the </strong>apparent crash in UK property prices. My pleasure, I should clarify, is not schadenfreude; I do not delight in the suffering of overleveraged fellow Britons. Nor do I have any particular dislike of estate agents or relocation firms or producers of the property-related television programming that we of these isles appear to have identified as our area of comparative advantage in <br>a globalising world. I simply think it's nice when homes are cheap.</p> <p>Too much of the dinner conversation I have heard in the past seven years has been about property. Londoners speak of flats the way I imagine submariners speak of women: with frustration, longing, and suppressed nervousness. And they do so for similar reasons. Both groups suffer from operating in capriciously hostile environments.</p> <p>Make love not undersea war, I say. Bring down the prices, head for the surface, and let's get it on. How wonderful it would be if we could buy housing at half today's valuations, and tuck our (metaphorical in my case) children to bed secure in the knowledge that prices would rise at the same sedate pace as wages for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>Perhaps one day full-time writers could afford to live in central London again, and fresh immigrants could arrive unburdened by their lack of local parents to hit up for a deposit. Conversation could then turn to more stimulating topics, like the weather, which in our time of global warming promises to become rather interesting indeed.</p> <p><strong>This week</strong> Mohsin watched The Dark Knight at the Odeon, Leicester Square: \"Because the kid in me insisted on according it the biggest of big-screen treatment. What a disappointing film.\" He also saw Moonlight and Magnolias at the Tricycle Theatre, London: \"Where I witnessed a man playing a man playing a woman playing a woman giving birth to a child - and doing it flawlessly.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Marcel Berlins is away.</p>",
  "<p>On the day I go to rehearsals for 365, the big new show from the National Theatre of Scotland - the successor to 2006's hit Black Watch, and last year's spectacular The Bacchae - nobody has the faintest idea how the play is going to end: not the actors, not the director, not even the playwright. The production opens in just two weeks.</p> <p>\"We have decided to kill off a character,\" says director Vicky Featherstone, who is also artistic director of the NTS, perhaps a touch enthusiastically. Two young women, watched over by Featherstone and movement director Steven Hoggett (who also worked on Black Watch and The Bacchae), enact a poised, strange, almost ritualistic kind of dance. There are words, but 16-year-old actor Marlene Madenge is improvising. \"Don't worry, we'll write proper words for you - lines,\" Featherstone reassures her, before giving the cheery instruction: \"You can die now!\"</p> <p>The serious-looking, shaven-headed man in the corner of the room, with light lashes and pale-green eyes, is David Harrower, the man who is going to have to come up with the lines. The writer - who won an Olivier award for Blackbird, his razor-sharp play about a woman who tracks down the man she had a relationship with when she was 12 - is, it is safe to say, deep in terra incognita. While there is nothing new in plays being devised through workshops, it is unusual for a writer like Harrower to put himself in the position of writing a drama as it emerges from the disparate imaginations of a group of people in rehearsal. \"Usually, I'd be at home shaping this thing with the variety of tools that I use; and bringing it in and expecting people to go, 'Wow, this is amazing, it's Harrower's usual sculpted prose,'\" he says. \"OK, I'm just joking. But I'm being less of an author in this than anything I've ever done. I build the fucking scaffold at home myself, usually. I have a sense of where the story is going, I know where it's going to end, I have the whole shape of it in my head. But with this, I haven't even read the play through yet.\" Frankly, I can see the fear in his eyes.</p> <p>So why is he putting himself through nine kinds of torture? What is this play all about? Crudely put, 365 tells the stories of 15 young people as they emerge from care homes. The idea came when Featherstone read Nick Davies' book on child poverty, Dark Heart: The Shocking Truth About Hidden Britain. \"It was one of those books that opened up a new way of thinking about the world to me,\" she says. \"It exposed the hypocrisy of how we think of ourselves in Britain as a civilised society - and yet we are surrounded by children in the most terrible circumstances.\" The ideas in the book kept resonating, but she couldn't think of a way to dramatise them until she talked to a trustee of Barnardo's, who told her about the \"practice flats\" that young people encounter when they leave care. There are many different kinds of flats, but at best they are a safe environment where young people can learn to live unsupervised and prepare for the adult world: to budget, to cook, to shop, to clean.</p> <p>As soon as Featherstone struck on the notion of the practice flat, she knew she had found the device that could turn her hazy idea into a piece of theatre: it was the place where these children transformed themselves, a threshold between one world and another. \"It zoomed into my head,\" she says. She asked Harrower to write the play, but there was no question of waiting for him to come up with a text over a period of months or years. Besides, he was keen \"to try a different way of working, I wanted to test myself\". According to Featherstone: \"I knew if we were going to make a piece of theatre we had to do it now; it felt urgent. Black Watch communicated something that people needed to know about at the time, and this felt similar. I wanted us to move quickly.\"</p> <p>Featherstone and Harrower researched their material, talking to young people who had been in care, social workers, psychotherapists and others. Featherstone knew she wanted a broad sweep, a cast of 15 or so. By the beginning of the rehearsal period, Harrower had written, he says, 27 \"proud pages\" - and they have nearly all been scrapped. \"They were banal and simplistic,\" he says. \"I don't begin plays this way. Usually I have a daft wee idea that grows this little carbuncle on it. Then that grows another bigger one on it, and that becomes a play. It doesn't start with, 'Ninety-five per cent of children in care have mental health issues.' I don't start with statistics, ever. I start with an idea like a man rubbing the inside of his thigh and someone seeing it, do you know what I mean? The writing that came out of my addressing statistics was shit.\"</p> <p>He had another problem. \"I was worried there weren't enough stories in a flat, with the poverty of imagination I have,\" he says. \"My first thought was, do they want a lot of Scots kids sitting around taking drugs? Because that's not the stuff that I write.\" But the subject matter suggested a more allusive, less documentary approach. \"We did more and more research, and realised the flat means the end of care and the end of state parenting, and it also means the beginning of adult life,\" he says. \"It also means a place where these people can die; a place where things can fuck up. So it became this very complex metaphorical place where you find out how well you are prepared for the world, about your identity.\"</p> <p>The flat the audience will see as a stage set represents a number of different flats scattered across Glasgow. The stories of the characters do not reflect directly what Harrower and Featherstone gleaned from interviews, though Harrower says: \"The thing about this world is, once you get into it, it's a place with so many ghosts.\" He heard memories of people with forgotten names, stories that seemed to have migrated into urban myth through their retelling, and anecdotes that didn't resolve because no one ever knew how the kid ended up. </p> <p>The narratives are fragmented and layered, a torn-up storytelling style that reflects the often confused inner lives of the young people the play portrays. \"In a sense,\" says Harrower, \"we are dealing with people who have very little sense of where they have come from and where they are going. You come back to core psychological things. Low self-esteem, anger, mental-health issues. These are people who are not in control of their own narratives. Every time you want to complete the circle you can't. Time and again, with everyone I've talked to, there is a sense of unfinishedness about these people, incompleteness.\" Harrower talks about how children in care often grow up without a sense of their own identity or story - children for whom there is no family photo album, no shared jokes, no clan traditions, no one to tell you what your first words were or what you were like as a baby. \"For these people,\" says Featherstone, \"there can often be no such thing as a reliable narrator.\" The search for a personal narrative became an analogy, for Featherstone, of the act of seeing a piece of theatre, \"where we try to latch hold of a narrative and grasp at a truth\". </p> <p>Harrower has had to learn that storytelling is not always best done through words, and that it can be done through gesture, movement. \"When I see people fannying around on the floor, I think, that's going in my story, the story that I started? Fuck off! But as it gets tighter and tighter, I realise this is what I always wanted this piece to be: a collective response to something.\" He is also having to withstand the experience of being a writer in the front line. \"[The cast] have got to learn that, for the greater good of the piece, some people are not going to get as much as other people. I write a monologue for somebody, and everyone wants a monologue. It's like you're coming into a war-torn country with a lorry full of rice, and every day people gather round the back of the lorry and you unload your scripts, and they get what they get. And there's always about four or five who don't get anything, and they sort of retreat to the corner of the room.\"</p> <p>Harrower - almost certainly his own harshest critic - says: \"Everything I have written up to now is two people arguing about why one of them left the other. It feels very earthbound. I don't think I have ever used a metaphor well.\" Despite the self-effacement, he remains passionately addicted to theatre as a form. \"I've been pissing around doing film and TV for the past year, and I think, 'Why am I wasting my time with that shit?' I could stage the Peloponnesian war between two people in a caravan.\" I have no doubt that he could: for now, though, all eyes will be on the allusive, rich piece of storytelling that 365 promises to be.</p>",
  "<p>Two major European carriers, Air France-KLM and Iberia, reported a slump in profits yesterday as the airline industry continues to suffer from high fuel costs. </p> <p>British Airways, which posted an 88% fall in profits last week, also confirmed that the economic downturn is hitting demand as higher fares depressed economy-class sales. </p> <p>Air France-KLM, the world's largest airline by revenues, said first-quarter profits fell by 59% to \u20ac168m (\u00a3133m) and Iberia, which last week confirmed merger talks with BA, swung to an operating loss of \u20ac3.9m. Air France-KLM is seeking a further \u20ac180m in cost savings \"in response to the economic environment\", the airline said, with its annual fuel bill expected to rise by nearly one-third to \u20ac5.86bn. Both airlines blamed the poor results on high fuel costs.</p> <p>BA warned last week that the industry faced its \"worst ever\" trading environment after first-quarter profits were nearly wiped out by the cost of keeping its planes in the air. The airline indicated yesterday that passenger numbers are being affected by fare increases implemented over the past two months to cover the rising cost of oil. </p> <p>Traffic fell 3.5% overall as BA flew 94,000 fewer passengers in July, with passenger numbers in economy-class cabins declining by 4.1% as the carrier admitted that cheaper tickets were \"most sensitive to price changes\". BA's performance in the all-important UK-to-US market deteriorated with the number of seats sold falling from 81% to 75%.</p> <p>Iberia confirmed that it is close to requesting clearance from US competition authorities for an alliance with BA and American Airlines. The partnership will allow the three airlines to cooperate over fares and schedules, creating a powerful grouping with a strong position in the transatlantic market. Fernando Conte, Iberia's chairman, said he was \"positive\" about the expected reaction of the US government to the bid for anti-trust (competition law) clearance.</p> <p>Air France-KLM's deputy chief executive, Pierre-Henri Gourgeon, welcomed the move. \"In this business there are too many players and when things turn bad it becomes a suicidal race,\" he said. \"BA, Iberia link up, that means one less player.\"</p> <p>Ryanair, Europe's largest budget airline, provided some better news for the sector by reporting strong July traffic figures. Its passenger load factor, which states the number of seats sold per flight, dipped from 90% to 89% and was in line with analysts' expectations. Nonetheless, the airline expects to make a loss this financial year if the oil price stays at high levels. However, the pressure on airlines has eased slightly this week as the cost of oil fell below $120 (\u00a361) a barrel.</p> <p>Ryanair's fraught relationship with BAA reached a new low yesterday after it emerged that the airport owner is suing the Dublin-based carrier over non-payment of landing fees.</p> <p>Britain's largest airport operator is taking legal action to recover millions of pounds' worth of payments that have been withheld since April. Ryanair's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, is refusing to pay in full fees that have climbed from \u00a35.50 a passenger to \u00a35.88 since the spring.</p> <p>It is understood that BAA has been attempting to recover the charges for some time. BAA said the matter was \"in the hands of the lawyers\" and added: \"Our charges remain within the limit we are allowed to charge by our regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority.\" </p> <p>Ryanair said that BAA's price increases this year have been \"more than three times the rate of inflation and totally unjustified at a time when most other UK and European airports are reducing costs and charges. Ryanair will continue to oppose this regulatory rip-off.\"</p>",
  "<p>Share prices rose sharply on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday as tumbling oil prices raised hopes that the inflationary threat to the global economy was abating.</p> <p>With the cost of crude falling to a three-month low, the FTSE-100 index closed up 2.5% on the day, while the Dow Jones industrial average was up more than 290 points by early afternoon in New York.</p> <p>The prospect of an increase in output from the Opec cartel, coupled with signs of reduced demand from the recession-threatened economies of western Europe and North America, left prices almost $30 a barrel below their peak early last month. Fears of a stand-off between the United States and oil-rich Iran also eased after Tehran sought to defuse a row about its nuclear programme.</p> <p>Concerns that tropical storm Edouard would damage oil facilities in the Gulf of Mexico also proved groundless, the bad weather bypassing refineries in Texas.</p> <p>As a result, US crude was down $1.83 at $119.58 a barrel, up from a session low of $118.00, the lowest price since May 5. London Brent crude lost $2.26 to $118.42.</p> <p>Edward Meir, analyst at MF Global, said: \"It seems that the market is losing interest in geopolitical and weather-induced 'props' and instead is becoming more aware of growing supply/demand imbalances.\" </p> <p>Other commodities such as copper, gold and platinum also fell, hit by expectations that slower economic growth would limit demand and, as the dollar rose, making commodities priced in the US currency more expensive for foreign buyers. The dollar rose to its highest level in almost two months against a basket of global currencies, while gold - traditionally a haven for investors when inflation is rising - was down 2% on the day at $877 an ounce, its lowest level in three months.</p> <p>With hedge funds unwinding their positions in oil, analysts said further falls in energy prices were likely.</p>",
  "<p>Actor Gael Garcia Bernal has been pitching for backing for a new project. No surprise there - but instead of Los Angeles moneymen, he has been talking to the British third sector. He wants it to support Resist, his documentary on individual stories of rebellion, told through a website and film project. </p> <p>\"The involvement of charities means that not only will the film inspire people to act but we can also give them a way to put this [inspiration] to use afterwards,\" says Bernal, who is co-producing the project with Thomas Benski and Pulse Films. \"We want to build a community looking at resistance.\" They are working on funding, research and distribution support with non-governmental organisations and media organisations. </p> <p>Bernal and his Resist comrades were among the eight groups of film-makers who took part in The Good Pitch, a novel part of last month's Britdoc festival in Oxford. They presented their social action documentaries to leading third sector organisations, including the Sundance Institute, Christian Aid and Amnesty International, as well as broadsheet newspapers, MySpace, and Vice magazine. </p> <p>Marc Silver, Resist director and project strategist, is hoping that the collaboration will create something remarkable. \"We want people to realise that they have the power to resist,\" he says. \"We hope that NGOs will be able to tell their members about the project, driving more people to the site. When we make the film, hopefully it will inspire more people to visit the site and join the Resist network, continuing the whole process.\"</p> <p><strong>Accelerating trend</strong></p> <p>The Good Pitch, supported by the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust (JRRT) and One World Broadcasting Trust, is driven by an accelerating UK trend. Al Gore's 2006 global-warming shock-doc, An Inconvenient Truth, seems to have woken up UK NGOs to the wonders of documentary. </p> <p>Chloe Baird-Murray, Amnesty's director of creative relationships, explains: \"In most cases, the support is not just financial. We have worked with all sorts of films, including features, such as Blood Diamond. In the past, people came to us with completed projects and asked us for support, but now we work in a more holistic way, from script development and research onwards.\"</p> <p>But what about editorial control? \"If the film-maker wants to tell both sides of the story, they can do that,\" Baird-Murray says. \"We support ... freedom of expression. Any storytelling is positive for us if it shines a light on what is happening in the world. We get involved to tell our side of the story correctly. Documentaries can be overwhelming if they do not contain a solution to the problems they highlight. NGOs can give that. Al Gore's film ended with an example of what people can do. People are ripe for that kind of activism.\"</p> <p>In the US, where public service broadcasting is weak, these sorts of arrangements have been around for decades. As a result, ongoing relationships between film-makers, the third sector and commercial brands flourish. For example, Working Films coordinated the US national community engagement campaign with the 2007 film Ghosts of Abu Ghraib. It brought together the National Religious Campaign Against Torture, the American Civil Liberties Union, faith groups and others to end what it says is the US policy sanctioning torture.</p> <p>This approach is now taking off in the UK. Amnesty and other third sector groups are discussing working with Resist, and the human rights organisation is also giving its backing to Erasing David, another documentary from The Good Pitch, which will tell the story of one man's quest for oblivion. Shocked by his daughter's identity theft, David Bond will attempt to wipe himself from all UK state, private and commercial records to show the privacy dangers of our data-guzzling society. </p> <p>As well as other backing, Amnesty can offer Bond and his co-producer, Ashley Jones, its campaigning networks, including groups Amnesty is in touch with in its work on the UK's 42-day counter-terrorism detention law. \"First we figured out what we wanted to say,\" Bond says. \"Then we went to Britdoc, and its organisers supported us pitching for funding. When people have seen what we have made, we want them to feel inspired to act.\" </p> <p>Britdoc and the JRRT are each giving the Erasing David project \u00a335,000. So what's in it for the NGOs? Mark Ross, JRRT project adviser, says: \"We got involved with Britdoc two years ago because we thought documentaries were an effective way of getting complicated issues - which can't be summed up in a soundbite - through to the public. Erasing David looks like it will be entertaining, and this makes it more accessible, which is perfect when trying to interest people in a debate.\"</p> <p>It's a perfect marriage. NGOs get access to some of the world's best film-makers, and film-makers get access to research, distribution and funding at a time when mainstream TV and film moneymen are shrinking from documentaries. </p> <p>However, not everyone is as convinced about the relationship. Vaughan Smith, an independent video journalist and founder of the Frontline Club, which champions independent journalism, is concerned that there may be difficulties when dealing with disputed topics. \"It is easy to see how these collaborations can work with subjects such as science, if there is transparency,\" he says. \"But I think that where, for example, a film-maker wants to make a documentary on the international criminal court, one needs to be particularly careful that both sides of the argument are properly analysed. </p> <p>\"I sense that film-makers often want to make a film and they are not too concerned where they come from. I am a journalist and I like to see things investigated with a critical eye. When there is more than one view on a topic, we need to be careful about where backing comes from.\"</p> <p>The Frontline Club is looking at various forms of collaboration with NGOs, but within strict editorial guidelines. \"I can't think of subjective journalism that I have a problem with, if it is marked as subjective and clear,\" Smith says. \"Most journalism is already subjective, even if it is labelled as objective. I am suspicious of all organisations, including news organisations. There always needs to be proper controls to protect editorial integrity. For NGOs, collaboration won't work if they ask for something too specific. But if, say, they want to fund increased reporting from Congo, it can work.\" </p> <p><strong>Changing media landscape</strong></p> <p>Marriages of convenience are necessary for commercial and NGO brands, as well as for film-makers and journalists, to handle the changing media landscape, according to Jess Search, Britdoc chief executive: \"There used to be five broadcasters paying high sums for documentaries. Now, with, for example, the probability that ITV will be able to reduce its public service commitments, everything is different. Commercial and third sector brands can invest in documentaries if it is done sensibly.\" </p> <p>Search argues that if a film-maker has an NGO on board, it can balance out the power of the increasingly interfering modern commissioning editor. \"Films are becoming like political elections,\" she says. \"You need people who will email friends and walk the streets to talk about a project. Third sector people care enough to do that.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Daniel Lee is a journalist, author and lecturer in the film and media department of Birkbeck, University of London.</p>",

  "<p>Sales at Britain's biggest carpet retailer, Carpetright, have slumped as economic conditions worsen, prompting many City analysts to slash their profit forecasts.</p> <p>Like-for-like sales in Britain and Ireland plunged 15.4% in the 13 weeks to August 2, against a strong quarter a year ago, as hard-up consumers delayed home improvements. Sales in the Netherlands, Belgium and Poland were flat and total sales at the retailer's 686 shops were down 9.2%.</p> <p>Lord Harris of Peckham, Carpetright's founder, chairman and largest shareholder, with a 23.4% stake, said: \"People have stopped spending on the home. It's not only in the carpet industry; it's in furniture, curtains, bedding - everything's gone quiet in that area.\" </p> <p>The veteran carpet trader expects this year to be among the toughest he has seen in his 50-year career - the worst since the 1974 oil shock. \"It's very, very tough,\" he said. \"People have got more indebted than they were in 1974.\" He called on the government to reduce stamp duty for first-time buyers and give them 2-3% tax credits \"to get the housing market moving\".</p> <p>Customer numbers have fallen 20% from last year amid rising household bills and sliding house prices, and those who are still buying carpets tend to go for cheaper products. Carpetright's \"super-saver\" carpets, which sell for less than \u00a312 a square metre, made up nearly a fifth of sales in the final week of the quarter, compared with 8% a year ago. People are also trying to save money by buying off-stock rolls in shops rather than ordering \"cut lengths\" from sample books.</p> <p>Many analysts slashed their annual profit forecasts. \"Dreadful sales in an awful environment,\" said Panmure Gordon's analyst Philip Dorgan. He cut his profit estimate to \u00a333.5m from \u00a346.5m and warned that the dividend was in danger of being cut. </p> <p>The shares fell initially but then recovered strongly to close 28.5p higher at 595.5p, a rise of 5%.</p>",
  "<p>The upmarket US supermarket chain Whole Foods is facing an uphill struggle to expand across the Atlantic after suffering losses of $18.4m in a year at its six newly opened stores in Britain.</p> <p>Whole Foods, which specialises in organic and healthy produce, last night revealed that it was reviewing its nascent British operations and that it will be cutting back on openings in its home market. </p> <p>\"We are disappointed in our results in the UK,\" chief executive John Mackey said on a conference call. \"We are carefully evaluating all aspects of our operations in the UK.\"</p> <p>Whole Foods' global profits slumped by 31% to $33.9m, sending its shares tumbling by 15% in after-hours trading on the Nasdaq exchange. </p> <p>It blamed sluggish economic conditions for a slowing in sales growth in the US, where it will only open 15 stores over the next 12 months rather than the planned 30 or 40.</p> <p>In Britain, Whole Foods' arrival was billed as a potential boon to gourmets last year. Its flagship store in London is spread over three floors of a former Barkers department store in Kensington High Street, taking up 80,000 square feet of space. But the company's results suggested that shoppers are yet to be won over.</p> <p>Mackey said there had been some improvement in recent months with the run rate of UK losses dropping to $16m on an annualised basis. </p> <p>\"Our goal is to reduce our operating losses to $13m in fiscal year 2009, $7m in fiscal year 2010 and to approach break even in 2011,\" he said, adding that Whole Foods had suffered similar initial losses when it entered Canada.</p> <p>\"We believe the long-term growth potential in the UK is much greater than in Canada and expect our investment to deliver strong returns over the long term,\" he said.<br></p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/robertfox\">Robert Fox</a> to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/simontisdall\">Simon Tisdall</a></p> <p>I am always sceptical about the success of specific ground operations, heralded from Washington and London in the terribly tangled mess of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. General David Petraeus launched his \"surge\" with some 35,000 extra troops in the spring of last year. Now, some of the extra troops are being brought home. Instead of victory, Washington talks about \"success\". <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/nov/01/usa.iraq\">Violence against US forces is down</a>, it is claimed \u2013 and this is undoubtedly true. The government in Baghdad under Nouri al-Maliki is stronger and the Iraq army has been growing in numbers and capability, and performing creditably in several areas, most notably in Basra. </p> <p>But problems remain, and this has been underlined by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/28/iraq.terrorism\">recent suicide bombings</a> in Kirkuk and Baghdad that killed at least 55 and injured more than 250. The targeting and tactics of the attacks suggests the hand of al-Qaida \u2013 the bombs were aimed at Shias in a religious procession and a demonstration of Kurds in Kirkuk. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/jun/09/guardianobituaries.alqaida\">Abu Musab al-Zarqawi</a>, the Jordanian founder of \"Al-Qaida in Mesopotamia\", preached against the \"axis of heresy\" linking Kurds, Shias and the American invader as the band of enemies against the true followers of Islam in Iraq. Zarqawi was betrayed and then killed by the Americans in 2006, but these recent bombs suggest his legacy lives on and al-Qaida is far from beaten by the Americans and the Sunni tribal militias. </p> <p>So, I think we can only say that the Petraeus surge is still very much a work in progress, and cannot be judged a magic ingredient that has suddenly turned the tide for the Americans in Iraq.</p> <p><strong>Simon Tisdall to Robert Fox:</strong></p> <p>To help understand what the \"the surge\" has (or has not) achieved, it is useful to cast one's mind back to the summer and autumn of 2006 when it appeared, to many if not most observers, that the US and its coalition partners were losing the battle to secure Iraq and that the country was sliding into a state of civil war. Coalition and civilian casualties were running at record highs, sectarian warfare following the bombing of the Shia shrines earlier that year was out of control, al-Qaida, led by the still extant Zarqawi, was striking with apparent impunity, and the isolated central government in Baghdad was powerless to act. Iraq appeared to be on the brink of anarchy encompassing all but Kurdish-controlled areas in the north and east.</p> <p>To make matters worse, Iran's al-Quds Revolutionary Guards operatives were busily stirring the pot, building up leverage especially in the south, and aiding those militants in Iraq, both Sunni and Shia, who were intent on forcing the Americans out. Under mounting pressure to admit defeat and throw in the towel, Bush acknowledged the gravity of the situation by ordering Pentagon and other policy reviews that autumn. The Baker-Hamilton Iraq Study Group was an independent, contemporaneous attempt to find a strategy that worked, or at least would cease to fail. In the end, what emerged was a decision to make one more big push to secure Iraq by sending in additional forces (\"the surge\"), rather than begin a phased withdrawal (which was what most people at the time expected would happen). I'm proud to say the Guardian exclusively <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/nov/16/iraq.topstories3\">revealed the surge decision</a> on November 16 2006 subsequently confirmed by the White House.</p> <p>It is incontrovertibly the case that the surge decision in November 2006 marked a critical turning point in the history of the US intervention in Iraq. Since that moment, the overall security situation, broadly defined, has slowly and unevenly improved, to the point where we can now realistically look forward to an Iraqi government taking primary responsibility for its citizens' safety and Bush can start cutting troop levels, as he did last week (Thursday July 31). This is not a victory, but neither is it the defeat that not so very long ago looked both certain and inevitable.<br> <strong>Robert Fox to Simon Tisdall</strong></p> <p>Undoubtedly, there have been improvements in security on the ground and an increase in capacity by the Iraqi army and the tribal militias now supporting the Malaki government in the Sunni triangle. But I think we have to look much further before we make judgments about turning points in the American strategy in Iraq. Sure, it may be a turning point, but not quite in the political direction intended. Rather like Chou en Lai being asked his view on the success of the French Revolution, I tend to think it is too early to make a definitive judgment on the success of the surge. Obviously, it is in the interest of the US presidential candidates to be positive about developments in Iraq \u2013 for both, it allows some much-needed room for manoeuvre to rebalance forces there and bring large numbers home.</p> <p>There is a very big \"but\" to all this, however. The surge is not entirely, nor even mainly, a military stratagem. It is political, and aimed at achieving America's political goal in Iraq \u2013 to achieve a stable, pro-American, functioning, unitary state at the heart of the Gulf security region. On this the jury is still out. There is still a lack of capacity in Malaki's government. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/may/30/iraq.uk\">police force</a> is weak and corrupt, and seems trapped in a cycle of underachievement. The Sunni tribal associations may be battling al-Qaida elements and paying lip service to the American line in order to get weapons, training and funds, but they are not pro-American, nor even pro a Shia-dominated government like al-Maliki's coalition. In the long run, they will turn away from the American-British axis. This is the opposite of the strategic aim of the surge.</p> <p>With operation <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/05/iraq.military\">Charge of the Knights</a>, the Iraq army and government have achieved a real and significant success. By all accounts, life in Basra is much changed, and for the better. But with this important tactical success, it should not be assumed that the problem of the Shia militias is resolved. The Mahdi militias of Moqtada al-Sadr appear weakened but not finished, down but not out. The rejectionism of the Sadrists, therefore, still appears unresolved. Additionally, there appears to be a serious threat of the dissident groups, on both sides of the sectarian divide, fragmenting into a perennial criminality.</p> <p><strong>Simon Tisdall to Robert Fox:</strong></p> <p>It's sensible to be cautious about long-terms gains occasioned by the \"surge\". The value, effectiveness and longevity of what has been achieved are open to question, as I wrote in my previous reply. Nothing in life is for ever and that applies with knobs on in Iraq. It could all go pear-shaped. Moqtada and his militiamen could make a comeback, the Sunni Awakening groups could go back to sleep, or turn on their US allies of convenience. Maliki could fail ... it's all possible. A senior US military official, a big proponent of the surge, told me recently that \"progress will not be linear\" and the \"enemy remains formidable\". Inserting caveats about future developments is necessary analytical practice in such a volatile situation.</p> <p>But to quote loosely another Chinese luminary, Confucius, \"he who walks in the middle of the road gets knocked down by traffic travelling both ways\". I'm in the right carriageway when I say I believe that a positive change for the better has been achieved that will have lasting benefits. Three reasons (but not the only ones) why I think this are: </p> <p>1) Iran, after years of malignly stirring the pot since 2003, has backed off since last autumn, having apparently decided that it is in its interests to support the much-strengthened Maliki government and, particularly, its timetable for an American withdrawal. Certainly, Tehran will hope to manipulate Maliki, but may find this harder as times goes by; </p> <p>2) Gulf Arab states, notably Saudi Arabia, are moving towards normalisation of relations, debt forgiveness and reconstruction collaboration with Iraq \u2013 despite its Shia-led government. This trend contradicts the \"polarisation and disintegration\" scenarios for Iraq that were so popular 18 months ago; </p> <p>3) US military reports say al-Qaida leaders are leaving Iraq and diverting new recruits away from the country. They're doing this because the security environment has got so much tougher.</p> <p>Unfortunately, they're not laying down their arms. Instead, they're heading for Aghanistan ...</p> <p><strong>Robert Fox to Simon Tisdall:</strong></p> <p>I think the real test of the surge is coming in the next few months. If the Americans pull back too soon, it can all fall apart. I am slightly more wary about Iran than you, Simon. I think Iranian policy towards Iraq, and the powerful Shia factions and parties, seems quite opaque. One minute, they seem to back either Hakim/SCIRI (ISCI) and Badr, then pull back. Moqtada has some clerical backing in Quom, notably from Grand Ayatollah Haeriri. Tehran seems to think it can manage Maliki. After all, they told him to avoid signing up to a permanent US presence in Iraq under the new status of forces agreement that will follow the UN mandate when it runs out at the end of the year. The test of stability will come with the provincial elections due soon, which will see a real distribution of power and spoils, particularly in the south.</p> <p>The Americans will have to say the surge has been a <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/iraq/article3803942.ece\">success</a> because they cannot sustain present force levels in Iraq and Afghanistan. The British will also try to claim a piece of the success with the \"turn around\" in Basra. They are desperate to be gone and I understand that Gordon Brown has arranged with Washington and Baghdad for the bulk of British forces to be away from Iraq by the beginning of next June, when an American division and headquarters will move into Basra. By that time, it will be clear if the surge has passed its main test \u2013 whether it has ensured that Iraq can hold together as a functioning state.</p> <p><strong>Simon Tisdall to Robert Fox:</strong></p> <p>The \"surge\" is already over in military terms. The additional combat brigades deployed by Bush last year have all gone home, and overall troop levels are down to pre-surge levels. Bush's announcement last week on cutting the duration of operational tours, and his acceptance of \"<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/18/AR2008071801308.html\">time horizons</a>\" for a withdrawal, follow on from the official US assessment that the surge has worked and indeed has been a success. The surge's main military proponent on the ground, General David Petraeus, has been promoted to CentCom, as have several of his key counterinsurgency advisers. The current offensive in Diyala suggests there is still much work to be done. And Kirkuk could still blow up at any time. But you are right about Baghdad, Basra and the Sunni Triangle. They are much improved security-wise.</p> <p>Politically speaking, I agree the longer-term success of the surge is still an open question. The provincial elections due this year may be postponed, mostly due to Kurdish objections about Kirkuk's future. That could prevent, or discourage, large-scale Sunni Arab participation. After their boycotting of previous polls, it was hoped the Sunnis would get involved in the political process this time, thereby increasing its credibility. This, in turn, could delay general elections next year. Other unpredictable political factors include the Iranian presidential election campaign and whether Ahmadinejad wins again; and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselections2008\">US presidential poll</a>, with both main candidates using Iraq for campaign purposes (witness McCain's jibes about Obama's supposed lack of interest in meeting fallen warriors). </p> <p>Making Iraq a united, functioning country also requires a lasting settlement of the oil question \u2013 that is, who gets and controls which bit of the vast oil and gas reserves. Opening the industry to foreign ownership and exploitation, as recently proposed, could further complicate things politically.</p> <p>The surge was never a panacea. It was, initially at least, a last desperate attempt to stop a haemorrhage with a large sticking plaster. It has worked better than most expected. Will the bleeding stop? Increasingly, the message coming from the US is: Iraqis must decide for themselves.</p> <p>What a pity Bush did not take that view about Saddam Hussein pre-2003.</p> <p><strong>Robert Fox to Simon Tisdall</strong></p> <p>I agree that the surge is drawing to a close as the extra brigades sent in by David Petraeus are now being brought home. The question is what happens next, both for Iraq and America. The surge had to come to an end because the next president, whether McCain or Obama, cannot maintain such a high level of defence expenditure \u2013 over half a trillion dollars per annum, and now greater than the aggregated defence budgets of the rest of the world. Moreover, a lot of the equipment of the ground forces is used up and needs replacing urgently. The US government is currently devoting over $100bn on the \"reset\" programme to bring in replacement equipment.</p> <p>In the UK, we are faced with the same phenomenon, though you wouldn't know it. The equipment of the forces in Helmand and Basra, not least the helicopter force, is under colossal strain. It is unlikely to be replaced sufficiently with new kit at the rate required because the equipment budget is under such severe strain. Moreover, as we have both noted, both the UK and US are likely to have to reinforce in Afghanistan soon \u2013 particularly if the Canadians reduced their forces in southern Afghanistan and the Dutch pull out, as many in their parliaments and much of their press are now demanding.</p>",
  "<p>When protesters by the thousands <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/apr/07/olympicgames2008.china2\">hit the streets of London and Paris</a> earlier this year, denouncing China and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/apr/07/france.olympicgames2008\">trying to snuff the Olympic torch</a>, it appeared games were losing their mythic appeal. But with the opening ceremony this Friday, it's back to business as usual for Olympics \u2013 with business the operative word.</p> <p>In March, after <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/International/Story?id=4453454&amp;page=1\">anti-Beijing riots in Tibet</a> left dozens dead and sparked a crackdown by the Chinese military, the world appeared ready to turn its back on Beijing. Protests along the Olympic torch relay route put the spotlight on China's occupation of Tibet, its war on Tibetan culture and its dismal human rights record at home and even beyond, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/may/30/sudansanctions\">enabler-in-chief for Sudan's genocide in Dafur</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/apr/18/china.armstrade\">arms merchant to Robert Mugabe</a> in Zimbabwe. The torch relay fiasco also underlined the International Olympic Committee's failure honour its promise to use the games to leverage greater freedom in China. </p> <p>Upon winning the right to host the Olympics seven years ago, China pledged to improve its human rights performance. Last week provided evidence, however, of how little China and IOC value that promise. Chinese authorities won't even live up to an explicit pledge to <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gKf6TZUVV5O0svemHyOqBT1MvnxQD929MC3O0\">permit unfettered access to the internet</a> for reporters at the Olympic media centre. Separately, a <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/report/chinese-authorities-broken-promises-threaten-olympic-legacy-20080728\">report from Amnesty International</a> outlines how, rather than encourage greater freedom, the Olympics have given China a pretext to strike harder against dissent. </p> <p>Amnesty cites expansion of the \"re-education through labour\" programme to \"clean up\" Beijing ahead of the games, taking dissidents into custody and shipping them out of town to avoid embarrassing disruptions during the Olympics. Amnesty also reports that Shanghai activists have been put on a tighter leash, barred from leaving the city during the Olympic period and warned against talking to foreigners. </p> <p>In recent years, China's standard reply to challenges over its human rights record has been to assert that its double-digit economic growth improves human rights. In that, China echoes the true Olympic spirit: global business. At the nub, today's Olympics aren't about puffed up athletes or puffed up nationalism as much as they are about the money.</p> <p>The real gold in the Olympics is reserved for the IOC and its sponsors. The IOC reported income from sponsorships, broadcast rights, ticket sales and licensing of <a href=\"http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_845.pdf\">$4.2bn during the 2001-2004 Olympic quadrennium</a> (pdf), the last accounting period for which the IOC published full records, and that's certain to rise in this Olympic cycle. Income for its global sponsorship programme, The Olympic Partners (TOP), alone has increased from $663m to $866m from 12 global corporate marketing rights purchasers. Domestic sponsorships specific to the host country usually exceed the TOP take, and that should be especially true for the 2008 games when the host country is the world's largest and most coveted emerging consumer market. </p> <p>When the IOC and world leaders like George Bush contended after the protests that politics have no place in the Olympics \u2013 a ridiculous notion for an event where participants compete under national flags \u2013 they were really saying: don't let moral concerns interfere with big business.</p> <p>Olympic sponsors \u2013 who won't get any free publicity here \u2013 are spending an estimated $2bn to be associated with the games, not because they love sports, but because they want to sell computers and hamburgers and fizzy drinks and cars and phones and watches and shoes all over the world, particularly to 1.3bn Chinese. These games are an affirmation from the sponsors that Chinese consumers are sufficiently advanced to buy their products and from the Beijing authorities that their disciples are sufficiently free to indulge themselves with these trinkets every bit as unnecessary as an Olympic pin. </p> <p>Today's true Olympic moment won't be some pituitary case setting a world record in a sport that's ignored throughout the four years between Olympics, then sweating out a drug test. It will be a Chinese yuppie plunking down two months salary for one of the sponsors' mobile phones.<br> What we're seeing in Beijing isn't China's coming out party, as some pundits brand it, but a coming in party. The house that Mao Zedong built is entering the big leagues of global consumerism. That this spectacle unfolds under skies as soiled and obscured as the Olympic ideals, in venues as hideous as the Bird's Nest and the Watercube, tempts belief that there's a truly Olympian presence, a five ring version of Mao's picture staring out from the Gate of Heavenly Peace, and like the Great Helmsman, it cannot be pleased with what it is seeing.</p>",
  "<p>Despite <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/03/china.humanrights\">recent reports</a> that restrictions <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/02/china.censorship\">will be lifted</a> on some media and human rights websites, one event in which the Chinese are almost certain to win gold medals in is the internet surveillance and censorship race. But journalists do not have to wait for the vagaries of the policy shifts of the Chinese government in negotiation with the IOC. They can easily bypass the restrictions by using techniques that Chinese democracy activists already use, which are highly effective and practically unstoppable.</p> <p>The internet police in China number in the tens of thousands. They <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/2234154.stm\">regularly scan and add</a> new websites to the national blacklists. They have also excelled in blocking the majority of existing methods to bypass the firewall, including countless proxy servers and websites that teach people how to get around censorship.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Shield_Project\">Golden Shield project</a>, launched at the China security expo 2000, exists to amalgamate internet surveillance and filtering systems, public record databases and CCTV footage. Internet censorship in China also forbids the use of certain keywords in an email message, search engine query or within a website's address. Oversight technology is built into the national telecommunications infrastructure, network devices and hardware found in computer shops and prevalently into a growing number of software tools. For example, Skype Inc has developed a special version of its client, called <a href=\"http://about.skype.com/2004/10/tom_online_partners_with_skype.html\">TOM Skype</a> for Chinese internet users. It abides by Chinese requirements and implements keyword filtering in the instant messaging system.</p> <p>The best solutions for circumventing internet censorship at the moment are those that rely on \"western\" computers acting as a gateway for internet users in China. Two interesting projects come to mind. Both provide an opportunity for us to act in solidarity with users living behind national firewalls, by allowing them to browse the internet through our computers.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://torproject.org\">Tor Project</a>, originating from the US Naval Research Laboratory to assist defence and intelligence services in anonymous internet browsing, today comprises one of the most successfully and widely used anonymity networks. Maintained by a worldwide collective of supergeeks (or, rather, security and anonymity specialists), it uses several thousand servers around the world to disguise your internet identity and the destination of the website you are wishing to visit.</p> <p>To make Tor unblockable in China and other countries, a new feature has recently been added. Instead of joining the Tor network directly, thereby revealing your intention, you first connect to a computer set up by your friends or colleagues, who then introduce you to the Tor network (a \"virtual bridge\", they call it). Because the Chinese cannot know in advance who these friends of yours will be (technically speaking, their IP address), they cannot pre-empt by blacklisting. Once you do connect through the bridge to the Tor network, it is almost impossible for surveillance agencies to know that you are using Tor.</p> <p>Tor is an open-source tool, which has undergone an incredible amount of study, testing and review. It is released for free, has an excellent graphical interface and <a href=\"http://torbrowser.torproject.org\">is also available</a> as a portable version \u2013 meaning that it works straight off a USB memory stick without any prior installation.</p> <p>Another project to offer censorship circumvention is called <a href=\"http://psiphon.civisec.org\">Psiphon</a>. Released by the <a href=\"http://www.citizenlab.org/\">CitizensLab</a> in Toronto, Canada, it allows anyone with an internet connection, a static IP and the Windows operating system to install a web-based proxy on their computer. Then pass your IP address and password for accessing the proxy to the friend living in a censored internet environment. Since the system is based on closed trust networks (ie, you and your friends), it is incredibly difficult for surveillance agencies to detect and block it.</p> <p>So, journalists wishing to browse the internet freely from China should ask their colleagues or friends back home to set up one of the above solutions. Prior communication between the host \u2013 the one who runs the service from a country that does not practise internet censorship and the client \u2013 who uses the service is required to pass details of the proxy or the bridge. Both systems rely on the host and the client knowing each other, in order to remain unblockable. But, given that condition, both systems can be set up and working within half an hour.</p> <p>Civil society has answers to the problems posed by the implementation of intrusive and prohibitive technology. These solutions are used by democracy activists and journalists all over the world. Their ability to fool the most sophisticated surveillance and censorship system and their ease of installation and sensible graphical interfaces are proof that not all is lost in the digital battle for free speech.</p>",
  "<p>In the funhouse world of big-time political journalism, inaccuracies must not be tolerated - but unverified smears are allowed to fester and ooze.</p> <p>Thus if you take a look at <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/29/AR2008072902068.html\">Dana Milbank's already-infamous Washington Post column</a> of last Wednesday - the one in which he wrote that Barack Obama had morphed from the \"presumptive nominee\" to the \"presumptuous nominee\" - you will find a correction informing readers that some inconsequential observation Obama had supposedly made to British prime minister Gordon Brown instead came about during a conversation with opposition leader David Cameron. Aren't you glad we've got that straight?</p> <p>What hasn't been corrected is the toxic quote that Milbank and, earlier, his fellow Post journalist Jonathan Weisman attributed to Obama during a closed meeting with Democratic congressional leaders. \"This is the moment ... that the world is waiting for,\" Obama supposedly said. \"I have become a symbol of the possibility of America returning to our best traditions.\"</p> <p>The quote is wrong on two levels. One is pretty basic: It saw the light of day because an anonymous source who was at the meeting claimed he'd heard Obama say it. Did this person have a tape recorder? Was he taking notes? Not likely. Weisman himself <a href=\"http://blog.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/07/29/obamas_symbolic_importance.html\">says there is no tape</a>. Those words never should have been put inside quotation marks.</p> <p>On a deeper level, though, the quote, even if accurate, appears not to be true, because the Post may have omitted - or, in Weisman's case, discounted - crucial context. According to Weisman's blog, an Obama campaign official said the candidate's actual words were more along these lines: \"It has become increasingly clear in my travel, the campaign - that the crowds, the enthusiasm, 200,000 people in Berlin, is not about me at all. It's about America. I have just become a symbol.\"</p> <p>Yet Weisman's snarky tone suggests that he thinks the campaign was merely covering its ass when it put forth that version. And Milbank, who, unlike Weisman, was writing for the more influential print edition, doesn't even mention it. The next day, Milbank participated in <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2008/07/25/DI2008072502073.html\">an online chat</a> in which he <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/items/200808010004\">dismissed the complaints</a> of outraged Obama defenders as \"whines\".</p> <p>It is ever thus with the <a href=\"http://www.whatliberalmedia.com/\">so-called liberal media</a>, whose card-carrying members make their bones by kicking the tar out of liberal politicians. It's a game, and everyone understands the rules. By beating up on liberals on what appear to be cheap symbolic issues, the pundits borrow against future coverage, when they'll be criticising conservatives on more important matters like war, taxes and the environment.</p> <p>But as we've learned over the years, elections tend to be decided more on symbolism than on substance. And, as Milbank's sneering putdown shows, the media often can't be trusted even to get the symbolism right. If an anecdote fits the preordained frame - in this case, that <a href=\"http://thephoenix.com/Boston/News/65569-Leggo-my-ego/\">Obama is full of himself</a> - well, damn the facts, because this is just too good to check.</p> <p>What was the false symbolic narrative of Al Gore's campaign in 2000? Why, that he was a preening liar, of course. Right on cue, the media began <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/quotes/internet.asp\">falsely reporting</a> that Gore had claimed to have \"invented the internet\", quotation marks included. In an election decided by just one vote on the US supreme court, that may have been enough to tilt the outcome to George Bush.</p> <p>Or consider the hapless 2004 Democratic contender, John Kerry, cast as a pretentious phony. Kerry, inexplicably a fan of stock-car racing, was quoted by New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd as haughtily saying: \"Who among us doesn't like Nascar?\" As the incomparable <a href=\"http://www.dailyhowler.com/dh100204.shtml\">Bob Somerby has shown</a>, Kerry not only never spoke those words, but Dowd wasn't even there. Yet the phrase was gleefully repeated dozens of times during the 2004 campaign, including, on several occasions, by Dowd's Times colleagues.</p> <p>It would have been nice if Washington Post ombudsman Deborah Howell had dealt with Milbank's hit-and-run attack this past Sunday. <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/01/AR2008080102874.html\">But she didn't</a>, and apparently she's not going to say anything this coming Sunday, either.</p> <p>She should. Because it is upon such falsehoods that the electoral narrative is built. The Republicans, through such tricks as their <a href=\"http://gop.com/audacitywatch\">Audacity Watch</a>, are trying to build up John McCain by tearing down Obama as a self-regarding elitist who's already acting like he's president.</p> <p>Obama is hardly a perfect candidate. His moves to the centre, though predictable, have been awkwardly executed - his weekend <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/05/barackobama.uselections2008\">switch on offshore oil drilling</a> being just the latest example. His long association with the Rev Jeremiah \"God damn America!\" Wright <a href=\"http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2008/03/throughout-his.html\">remains problematic</a>, and you can be sure we haven't heard the last of it.</p> <p>But that's no excuse for the media to cobble semi-reported, anonymously sourced tidbits into a fake narrative that mockingly suggests Obama is already starting to make plans for his second term. Here they go again. Will they be called on it? Or will they be allowed to dissemble and distort once again?</p>",
  "<p>Two major European carriers, Air France-KLM and Spain's Iberia, have reported a slump in profits as the airline industry continues to suffer from high fuel costs. </p> <p>British Airways, which posted an 88% fall in profits last week, also confirmed the economic downturn was hitting demand as higher fares depressed economy class sales. </p> <p>Air France-KLM, the world's largest airline by revenues, said first quarter profits fell by 59% to \u20ac168m (\u00a3133m) while Iberia, which last week confirmed merger talks with BA, suffered an operating loss of \u20ac3.9m. </p> <p>Air France-KLM is seeking a further \u20ac180m in cost savings \"in response to the economic environment\", the airline said, with its annual fuel bill expected to rise by nearly one third to \u20ac5.86bn. </p> <p>Both airlines blamed the poor results on high fuel costs. BA warned last week that the industry faced its \"worst ever\" trading environment after first quarter profits were nearly wiped out by the cost of keeping its planes in the air. </p> <p>The airline indicated today that passenger numbers were being affected by fare increases implemented over the past two months to cover the rising cost of oil. </p> <p>Traffic fell 3.5% overall as BA flew 94,000 fewer passengers in July, with passenger numbers in economy class cabins declining by 4.1% as the carrier admitted cheaper tickets were \"most sensitive to price changes.\" </p> <p>BA's performance in the all-important UK-to-US market deteriorated with the number of seats sold per flight falling from 81% to 75%. </p> <p>Iberia confirmed that it is close to requesting clearance from US competition authorities for an alliance with BA and American Airlines. The partnership will allow the three airlines to co-operate over fares and schedules, creating a powerful grouping with a strong position in the transatlantic market between Europe and north and south America. </p> <p>Fernando Conte, the Iberia chairman, said he was \"positive\" about the expected reaction of the US government to the bid for anti-trust clearance. </p> <p>Ryanair, Europe's largest budget airline, provided some better news for the sector by reporting strong July traffic figures. Its passenger load factor, which states the number of seats sold per flight, dipped from 90% to 89% and was in line with analysts' expectations. Nonetheless, the airline expects to make a loss in the current financial year if the oil price stays at high levels. </p> <p>However, the pressure on airlines has eased slightly this week as the per-barrel cost of oil fell below $120 (\u00a361).</p>",
  "<p>E.ON UK, one of the UK's leading energy companies, has decided that it wants to <a href=\"http://www.eon-uk.com/generation/supercritical.aspx\">replace</a> one of its old, coal-fired power stations with a modern one using the latest available coal combustion technology. The new power station will be 20% more efficient than the current power station. It will replace it one-for-one, on the same site \u2013 so no additional infrastructure requirements, such as access roads, and no conversion of a site to industrial use. The planning application, one might think, will be a shoo-in.</p> <p>However, this expectation has been turned on its head. While the debate around UK energy policy rages, the planning application has been with the government since December 2006. Recently, even the developer called for the government's planning decision to be postponed in order to allow for more clarity on energy policy. And this week, the <a href=\"http://www.climatecamp.org.uk/\">Camp for Climate Action</a> has threatened to shut down the existing power station to protest against the new plant. </p> <p>Energy policy is complicated at the best of times. It has to reconcile security of supply, affordability and sustainability. Recent retail price increases have focused attention on affordability, and all the while environmental requirements are transforming the industry and pushing up costs. UK electricity generators are increasingly investing in renewable energy sources such as wind, wave and tidal or biomass, to name but a few. Last year, the share of electricity generated from renewable energy sources reached 5%. The most ambitious targets for 2020 only set the share of renewables at 15% of energy and around 30% of electricity. In order to maintain security of supply, the remaining 70% will have to come from other sources. </p> <p>The other energy sources at our disposal are fossil fuels and nuclear power. Nuclear power is controversial, but emits no greenhouse gases during electricity production. Fossil fuels, on the other hand, do. Since 2005 the amount of carbon emissions from power generation has been limited, though, by the EU <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/environment/climat/emission.htm\">emissions trading scheme</a>.</p> <p>The scheme incentivises companies to become more innovative and invest in greener technologies in order to limit their emissions. Electricity generators are now looking at \"greener\", more efficient ways of generating and are planning to invest billions of pounds over the next decade. This investment will be crucial as we face the closure of over a quarter of the current power station fleet by the middle of the next decade, as stations come to the end of their lives. Gas-fired power stations are one answer to the energy gap, but companies will not want to become over-dependent on gas, a fuel the UK increasingly has to import. Nuclear power is another part of the answer. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_coal_technology\">Clean coal</a> is the final piece of the jigsaw. </p> <p>Some campaigners <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/05/kingsnorthclimatecamp.climatechange\">criticise</a> the use of the word \"clean\" in relation to coal. It might be very confident, but it indicates the direction of travel. It stands for highly efficient technologies, so less coal has to be burnt for the same electricity output, causing fewer emissions. In the long term, the industry wants to use <a href=\"http://www.co2storage.org.uk/\">carbon capture and storage</a> (CCS) \u2013 a technology which would allow 90% of emissions or more to be captured and stored underground. However, CCS is expensive and unproven, and we need the government to support the development and demonstration of CCS. </p> <p>If we want diversity of supply \u2013 not being overdependent on one fuel, such as gas \u2013 and security of supply, we need coal for the foreseeable future. If all \"unsuitable\" power stations were to stop operating tomorrow, we would be back to the three-day week \u2013 indeed the working week might be even shorter than that. Renewables are expanding fast, but they cannot yet meet all our energy requirements, nor all our electricity demand. Coal can help meet the demand for new power stations over the next decade. That is why Kingsnorth power station is so important for the energy future of this country.</p>",

Sales in the rest of Europe - the Netherlands, Belgium and Poland - were flat and total sales at the retailer's 686 stores were down 9.2%. </p> <p>\"People have stopped spending at the moment on the home,\" said Lord Harris of Peckham, Carpetright's founder, chairman and largest shareholder with a 23.4% stake. \"It's not only in the carpet industry, it's in furniture, curtains, bedding - everything's gone quiet in that area.\" </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jul/02/carpetrightbusiness.retail\">veteran carpet trader</a> expects this year to be among the toughest he has seen in his 50-year career - the worst since the oil shock of 1974. </p> <p>\"It's very, very tough - people have got more indebted than they were in 1974,\" he said. He called on the government to reduce stamp duty for first-time buyers and give them 2-3% tax credits \"to get the housing market moving\". </p> <p>Customer numbers have fallen 20% from last year amid rising household bills and sliding house prices, and those who are still buying carpets tend to go for cheaper products. </p> <p>Carpetright's \"super-saver\" carpets, which sell for less than \u00a312 a square metre, made up nearly a fifth of sales in the final week of the quarter, compared with 8% a year ago. People are also trying to save money by buying off-stock rolls in stores rather than ordering \"cut lengths\" from sample books. </p> <p>Many analysts took a knife to their annual profit forecasts. \"Dreadful sales in an awful environment,\" said Panmure Gordon analyst Philip Dorgan. He slashed his profit estimate to \u00a333.5m from \u00a346.5m and warned the dividend was in danger of being cut. </p> <p>Last year, Carpetright paid out a dividend of 52p a share. Harris said: \"We're not looking at this stage to cut the dividend but if we stayed for the whole year at [like-for-like sales of] 15% down, we'd have to look at it very carefully.\" </p> <p>But he believes the sales declines will slow to 5% over the rest of the year as the annual comparisons get easier. </p> <p>Deutsche Bank, the house broker, cut its pre-tax profit forecast to \u00a349m from \u00a351.5m. This compares with profits of \u00a359.5m last year. </p> <p>Harris insisted he was not comtemplating another bid for the company, saying he was focused on growing the business \"as steady and fast as we can\". </p> <p>The shares are worth less than half the \u00a312.50 at which he planned to buy out the business last year when he could not raise finance. </p> <p>Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates owns a 5.1% stake in the group through his Cascade investment vehicle. </p> <p>The shares fell initially but then recovered strongly to close 29p higher at 596p, a rise of 5%. Some analysts were encouraged that Carpetright was taking market share and still increasing profit margins. </p> <p>The company has reduced costs by laying off about 200 staff over the past year, helping to lift its gross margin by about 100 basis points. </p> <p>\"Longer-term, we are fans of Carpetright, a highly cash-generative market leader with an intrinsic valuation significantly in excess of the current share price,\" said Numis analyst Andrew Wade, who upgraded his rating on the stock to \"hold\" from \"reduce\".</p>",
  "<p>Drax has seen profits plunge by almost half as it pays the price for running the country's biggest single carbon-polluting power station, but the company still banged the drum today in favour of Britain building more coal-fired power stations like the one it runs. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/draxgroupbusiness\">Drax</a>, which plans to hand out \u00a350m to shareholders in dividends despite the profit slump, is now looking at increasing the amount of plant-based fuel it burns alongside coal. </p> <p>The rising cost of acquiring carbon credits helped cut pre-tax profits from \u00a3273m in the first six months of 2007 to \u00a3150m this time round, it said today. </p> <p>Drax, owner of a massive coal-fired plant in Selby, North Yorkshire, spent \u00a311m last year buying CO2 emission allowances to cover its carbon pollution. So far in 2008, the company has spent \u00a3107m on carbon creditsand faced additional costs due to the rising price of its basic feedstock coal, 34% higher at \u00a323.6 per megawatt hour. </p> <p>Dorothy Thompson, the chief executive of Drax, said she was looking at providing 500 megawatts of output from a broad range of sustainable sources, up from a previous plan for 400MW. </p> <p>She said biomass was not as cheap as burning coal but would reduce the firm's CO2 emissions. </p> <p>\"I am confident we will earn a sufficient economic return on the investment,\" she said.</p> <p>The technology for burning higher amounts of biomass will be ready by June 2010, later than a previous target of 2009. </p> <p>Thompson said she would consider burning more crop-based fuels if the government removed caps and allowed coal-fired power stations to do so. </p> <p>She said the UK still needed more coal-fired generation because neither nuclear nor wind provided the kind of \"variable\" power that was needed for a constant supply of electricity. </p> <p>\"I firmly believe that, long term, coal will be a key component to global energy supply,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>So the Tories <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/05/transport.transport\">have announced</a> that there are a million more speeding tickets issued each year compared to 1997. Need to sit down, cope with the shock? I don't think there's a car driver in the land who will be surprised by this. My licence currently carries two 3-pointers \u2013 both for doing 40ish in urban 30mph zones. </p> <p>But do I blame the Labour government? Of course not. It would be nice to have someone to blame but it's not a conspiracy, it's not even a policy. If it's a phenomenon, I'd call it Lazy Human Economics.</p> <p>When I was an opposition councillor in a council run by a Tory-Lib Dem axis, I watched as officers rubbed their hands in gleeful relief: bus lane cameras were to be installed all along a half-mile stretch. This meant they could reckon on \u00a3600,000 in fines across two years' budgets. But the third year's budget was marked \"zero\". By then, the experts knew, the drivers would have learned. So don't let any <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/jeremy_clarkson/\">Clarkson</a> type tell you these cameras don't change behaviour.</p> <p>More to the point, where did that \u00a3600,000 go? It went straight into the environment budget, swallowed by basic, overdue road repairs, new signage or free bus travel. </p> <p>But none of this was political. This is simply how we run our lives now, regardless of political affiliation or some faux-naive call for the right to drive at speed. The modern British citizen transgresses \u2013 whether it's speeding or dropping a cigarette end or dumping an old sofa on the pavement \u2013 and then complains when council taxes have to go up. We could, as individuals, choose not to make this mess \u2013 instead we employ Lazy Human Economics, wait for someone else to clear it up, and then complain when the bill arrives. </p> <p>Not surprisingly, therefore, councils have moved into this vacuum. \"Clearly,\" they calculate, \"our citizenry would rather leave it to us. But we're going to have to ask them to pay higher taxes and extra fines and cunning charges \u2013 that's the only way the budgets will balance.\"</p> <p>Today, the <a href=\"http://itn.co.uk/news/005d4e082e8206cc85ef8e40068d9ccd.html\">Tory spokesman asks</a>: where are all the safety measures which should have been purchased with the \u00a3100m levied in fines? But he knows and I know that this is specious. Cameras do <a href=\"http://www.rospa.com/roadsafety/info/speed_camera_factsheet_0806.pdf\">help prevent accidents (pdf)</a> but these fines aren't ring-fenced for safety measures. They're about making the budgets balance for all the Lazy Humans who'd rather leave it to someone else.</p>",
  "<h2>Where did the attack happen?</h2> <p>The Xinjiang Autonomous Region lies in China's north west, bordering central Asia. Covering a sixth of the country's total territory, it is a vast but sparsely populated area with around 19 million inhabitants. Around 8 million are Turkic-speaking Uighur Muslims, concentrated in the south of the region around cities such as Kashgar, known to the Chinese as Kashi, which lies around 2,500 miles from Beijing.</p> <h2>Why is there tension in the region?</h2> <p>Increasing controls on religious and cultural activity, large scale Han Chinese migration and economic marginalisation have all played a part, said Nicholas Bequelin of Human Rights Watch, who has researched the area extensively.</p> <p>The proportion of Han Chinese inhabitants rose from 6% in 1949 to 40% by around 2000 and migrants had begun to spread from cities into rural areas, where they found themselves in competition with Uighur communities for water and land. Many Uighurs complain that they have not benefited from the region's economic development, finding it harder to access benefits such as government grants or bank loans.</p> <p>\"The political reality of southern Xinjiang is that Uighurs don't see themselves as Chinese,\" added Bequelin. But while some seek a separate \"East Turkestan\", others merely hope for greater cultural freedom.</p> <h2>Has the area seen previous acts of violence?</h2> <p>Xinjiang has experienced sporadic outbursts of separatist activity and more general anti-government protest.</p> <p>\"It may be that as many as a couple of hundred have been killed by separatists alone [since the early 90s], and of course people have been executed or killed in police raids,\" said Professor Barry Sautman, a specialist in ethnic politics in China at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.</p> <p>Violence peaked in 1997, with fatal bus bombings and riots after a peaceful protest was suppressed. Experts believe the ensuing security crackdown halted the violence but exacerbated underlying tensions.</p> <p>Amnesty International alleges that as many as 200 Uighurs were executed between 1997-99. Mark Allison, its East Asia researcher, says Uighurs have been punished for peaceful protests \u2014 or even cultural expression \u2014 as well as violent activity.</p> <p>\"What we have documented in the past is a much broader crackdown \u2014 particularly after September 11 and the global war on terror,\" he said.<br>\"It's the only place in China where political prisoners are regularly sentenced to death and executed.\"</p> <h2>Are the Olympics safe?</h2> <p>Most analysts believe that yesterday's attack was timed to maximise publicity. But few believe that separatists will attack venues, spectators or athletes directly particularly given the intense security in Beijing and other host cities.</p> <p>The Chinese authorities allege they have disrupted several Olympics-related separatist plots, but have provided little evidence. Last week the army official in charge of security said Uighur separatists represented the greatest threat to the games, while Xinjiang's vice-governor said there were \"only a very small number of sabotage activities and many were nipped in the bud\".</p> <p>Andrew Gilholm, senior China analyst at the Control Risks consultancy, said the raid resembled attacks in the 90s, and did not indicate a new<br>threat. He added: \"Claims [of plots] have never been completely made up, but have probably often been exaggerated and misrepresented, at least from around 2002 until recently.\"</p> <h2>Who launched this attack?</h2> <p>As yet, no one has claimed responsibility. The state media reported that security officials suspected the East Turkestan Islamic Movement \u2014 often blamed for alleged plots \u2014 of planning pre-Olympic attacks. But Colin Mackerras, an expert on the region and emeritus professor at Griffith University, Australia, cautioned: \"There are quite a few groups<br>and the Chinese usually lump them all together as ETIM.\"</p> <p>Earlier this year Beijing also accused Hizb ut-Tahrir of planning raids; the group denied the claims, adding that since 2001 autocratic regimes had<br>used the \"war on terror\" as an excuse to clamp down on political opposition. In a recent video, three men who said they represented the little-known Turkestan Islamic Party threatened Olympic attacks and claimed responsibility for recent blasts in Chinese cities, but both the government and independent analysts doubt their involvement in those incidents. Some experts believe ETIM and TIP are one and the same.</p> <h2>How substantial is the threat posed by terrorists?</h2> <p>James Millward of Georgetown University in the US, an expert on Uighur separatism, has said he has yet to see evidence of a large, organised separatist or terrorist group.</p> <p>ETIM has been deemed a terrorist group by the UN and the US. But while there is evidence of links between ETIM and al-Qaida, most analysts believe those connections are historic and several believe they were exaggerated. Gilholm said that while the TIP claims did not appear credible, the method and rhetoric used to deliver the threat were worrying in themselves: \"Most of those [previous] groups have identified themselves as Uighur separatists, not as part of the wider Islamist terrorist agenda.\"</p>",
  "<p>Motorists could be in for some relief from rocketing fuel costs after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/oil\">price of oil</a> fell to a three-month low today, which could lead to lower petrol prices at pumps in coming weeks.</p> <p>Oil slid to $118 a barrel as investors predicted that demand from the US and Europe was waning, at a time when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jun/16/oil.saudiarabia\">some oil-producing countries have increased supply</a>.</p> <p>The fall in price extends the recent tumble from the July record high of $147.27 a barrel and comes on the back of a Reuters survey which revealed that supply from Opec, the group of major oil-producing nations, rose for a third consecutive month in July driven by increased output from the world's top exporter, Saudi Arabia. Opec's members produce two in every five barrels of oil.</p> <p>The recent falls have prompted some analysts to believe that the rally in oil prices is over for now. The soaring energy prices seen in the last few months combined with a global economic slowdown is dampening consumption in Europe and the US, the world's largest economy.</p> <p>Angus McPhail from investment firm Alliance Trust said prices could fall to about \u00a3100 a barrel - still high by the standards set in recent years - if economic data remains weak.</p> <p>The drop in oil price comes despite <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/01/useconomy.usa\">a storm in the Gulf of Mexico</a> stemming oil production in the region.</p> <p>Changes in the oil prices often takes six to eight weeks to hit the petrol pump.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Petrol Retailers Association said drivers could expect the price of fuel to fall by the end of summer. This will also be driven by lower petrol demand following the peak of the holiday season.</p> <p>\"It is possible that petrol prices will stay at a low level now on the back of falling oil prices and as demand is lower as we move into colder months,\" the PRA spokesman said.</p> <p>Motorists are currently paying an average of 111.9p for unleaded petrol and 124.9p for diesel. Unleaded broke through \u00a31 a litre mark for the first time last November, when oil was hovering below $100 a barrel, indicating that if the oil price keeps sliding drivers could see substantial benefits when they fill up.</p> <p>Petrol prices have already started to ease after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jul/22/supermarkets.oil\">a price war broke out last month on supermarket forecourts</a>.</p> <p>And drivers in the US are already paying less at the pump as the national price of petrol tumbled to an 11-week low yesterday.</p>",

  "<p>Japanese electronics giant Sony is buying its partner Bertelsmann out of their Sony BMG music joint venture, home to artists including Mark Ronson and Bruce Springsteen, in a deal worth $1.2bn (\u00a3614m) to the German media group.</p> <p>The move, which has been rumoured for some months, could provide Bertelsmann with the financial firepower to buy all or part of BSkyB's controversial 17.9% stake in ITV.</p> <p>There has been persistent talk that Bertelsmann's RTL business, which owns Five in the UK, is interested in buying up Sky's stake. The competition commission demanded that the stake be reduced to under 7.5% and Sky launched an appeal. While waiting for the outcome of that appeal, Sky is understood to have received informal approaches from a number of potential buyers.</p> <p>These are rumoured to have included TV producer Endemol, Italy's Mediaset and Israeli-American media mogul Haim Saban as well as RTL.</p> <p>Sony has been negotiating with Bertelsmann for some months about acquiring control of Sony BMG, which they created in August 2004 by pooling their music labels.</p> <p>Sony BMG already had $600m in cash on its balance sheet, which was split equally between the two owners. Bertelsmann will take all that cash, plus Sony is paying a further $600m for the business.</p> <p>Sony BMG will now become Sony Music Entertainment Inc (SMEI). As part of the transaction, the parties have also agreed to continue to share the company's manufacturing and distribution requirements between Sony's manufacturing subsidiary, Sony DADC, and Bertelsmann's services company, Arvato Digital Services by extending the agreements with Arvato for additional terms of up to six years. In addition, Bertelsmann will be taking over selected European music catalogue assets from Sony BMG.</p> <p>\"Music has been a vital and vibrant part of Sony's culture for over 20 years,\" said Sir Howard Stringer, chairman and CEO, Sony Corporation. \"This acquisition will allow us to achieve a deeper and more robust integration between the wide-ranging global assets of the music company and Sony's products, operating companies and affiliates. It enables us to offer a total entertainment experience to consumers,\" </p> <p>Bertelsmann refused to say what it intends to do with the cash raised.</p> <p>\"After a careful and thorough review, we made the strategic decision to sell our investment in this joint venture to Sony, a step that we believe will benefit the stakeholders of both our companies,\" stated Hartmut Ostrowski, chairman and CEO of Bertelsmann. \"This move is consistent with our new growth strategy and will enable us to focus on our defined growth areas. Sony has been an excellent partner, and they are the right company to take this business to the next step and ensure that it realizes its full value and potential.

  "<p>On Friday, saying it was time for a compromise on the energy issue, presidential hopeful Barack Obama voiced his tentative <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory?id=5495750\">support for a bipartisan proposal calling for the expansion of offshore oil drilling</a>, along with the development of alternative fuels and more efficient motor vehicles. Soon after, Obama implied that his willingness to allow the drilling in Florida <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/08/02/campaign.wrap/index.html\">\"wasn't really a new position\"</a>. But, of course, it is.</p> <p>As recently as late June, he said that, in order to protect the US coastline, he would <a href=\"http://miamiherald.typepad.com/nakedpolitics/2008/06/obama-as-presid.html\">enforce a drilling moratorium</a> that has been in place since 1981. (Democratic leaders and environmentalists have supported that ban for years.) What's not new: Obama's interest in working with Republicans to move the country toward greater energy independence, and his eagerness to appease voters. That's why he made a gesture that many of them believe would lower prices at the pump.<br> While I've been or more less accepting of Obama's float toward the centre as a political imperative as the election gets closer, this is one move I can't support. Reversing his position on campaign financing, for example, is one thing - a tactic that upset some of his supporters but won't necessarily have any kind of permanent or global repercussions. Offshore drilling, on the other hand, is sure to contaminate marine life and the water along Florida's coast, produce a number of small oil spills and, ultimately, contribute to the problem of global warming. A catastrophic oil spill is also a possibility.</p> <p>Now, it's true that Obama said that any compromise he would agree to would have to involve \"a careful, well thought-out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage\" - which <em>sounds</em> pretty, doesn't it? Too bad the reality is much uglier.</p> <p>\"There is no such thing as environmentally friendly drilling,\" says Greenpeace USA spokesperson Michael Crocker. After noting that damage to drills caused between seven and nine million gallons of oil to be spilled during Hurricanes Rita and Katrina, Crocker says: \"There's a real irony when it comes to offshore drilling. It's done so we can get more oil in the hopes of reducing gas prices. In the meantime, we keep burning fossil fuels, which causes more global warming, which leads to more hurricanes, which lead to more oil lost in spills - and yet, drilling does almost nothing to alleviate the cost of gasoline.\"</p> <p>Why doesn't it? \"There's simply not very much oil on America's shorelines,\" he says. \"Government studies have indicated that it will take a decade for any offshore drilling to pay off even minimally - and even then, prices will only be reduced by a few cents per gallon.\"<br> It's irresponsible of Obama to be cavalier about an issue that is of so much importance to the environmental health of the country, and the world. He should have stuck to his guns and insisted on finding cleaner alternatives that would truly make the US energy independent, instead of trying to placate short-sighted American car owners. To be fair, Obama did point out that it was \"important to recognise if you start drilling now you won't see a drop of oil for 10 years, which means it's not going to have a significant impact on short-term prices. Every expert agrees on that.\" And yet, that's really the fine print. What most voters will be paying attention to are the headlines announcing his willingness to let offshore drilling move forward - as I'm sure he and his strategists know.  And of course, most voters don't care about contaminating the shoreline. According to a <a href=\"http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/election_20082/2008_presidential_election/americans_split_on_which_is_more_important_offshore_drilling_or_crackdown_on_speculators\">Rasmussen poll released on July 29</a>, 57% percent of Americans favour offshore drilling (only 29% are opposed). And why is that? Because nearly the same number - 56% - believe gas prices would be likely to fall if the ban is lifted.<br> So while Obama is wrong to waver on this issue - he's punting on his duty as a public steward - voters are wrong, too. Many Americans might be willing to watch the new \"green\" cable channel, eat organics and recycle (although <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/29/us/29recycle.html\">not in Houston, Texas</a>), but they've got to start supporting the environmental movement in truly meaningful ways, not just trendy ones.</p> <p>They should start by getting over fuel prices and realising that one of the things we're paying for at the pump is our role in accelerating the pace of global warming. What voters should be clamouring for is not cheaper gas, but a truly longterm and sustainable solution - one that emphasises new, clean forms of energy and fuel-efficient transportation alternatives.</p>",
  "<p>The growing gap between rich and poor in booming Asian economies has left behind \"vast numbers of mothers and children\", putting millions of lives at risk, according to a report by Unicef, the United Nations children's agency.<br> Unicef said more than 40% of the world's children who died before their fifth birthdays in 2006 were living in the Asia-Pacific. It urged governments to face up to \"inequities in access to healthcare and huge disparities in health outcomes\". \"The divide between rich and poor is rising at a troubling rate within sub-regions of the Asia-Pacific,\" says the report, titled State of Asia Pacific's Children 2008. The report says there were 2.5 million child deaths in India and China, the two fastest-growing major economies in the world, accounting for nearly a third of all global child deaths. In India the figure was 2.1 million, whereas in China it was 415,000. Unicef called for Beijing to step up its efforts, but made plain that India has much to do despite four years of high economic growth. The report says the Indian economy needs \"across-the-board\" improvement in healthcare, gender equality and child protection. Particularly troubling was that south Asia spent so little on health, allocating just 1.1% of gross domestic product.  \"It is not just bigger health budgets. We could make a big difference by focussing on the three or four states in north India where most of these children die,\" said Daniel Toole, regional director for Unicef.</p> <p>\"Governments need to tackle female discrimination in the region too. Half the child deaths recorded in Pakistan, India and Afghanistan occurred in the first month of the baby's life.\" </p> <p>The boom in private sector healthcare for the region's expanding middle classes is draining hospitals of highly qualified staff with offers of better-paid jobs in private clinics, the report says.<br> With half the world's children living in the region, Unicef said it was imperative for governments to act if the 2015 global goal of reducing under-five mortality by two-thirds of 1990 levels was to be met. \"India could learn from China's experience in two big ways,\" said Toole. \"One is getting health services out to the villages. China was successful in what was called barefoot doctors. The other is female education. Educated women making educated choices has a big impact on the survival of their children.\"</p>",
  "<p>John Prescott is a relative newcomer to the world of blogging, but today he's probably wishing he had never taken it up. In a reply to a blog post, he's compared <a href=\"http://www.labourhome.org/comments/2008/7/27/84610/5977/134#134\">Gordon Brown to the captain of the Titanic</a>.</p> <p>To his credit, he made the slip in a reply to some of the 132 people who responded to a post he put up on the Labourhome website - his first venture into the blogosphere - <a href=\"http://www.labourhome.org/story/2008/7/27/84610/5977\">appealing for party unity</a>.</p> <p>Some bloggers never bother to reply to people who respond to what they say. But Prescott, who said that he enjoyed reading the replies, did.</p> <p>But then he wrote this:</p> <blockquote> <p>To ACLB who talked about the \"Tory sea\", \"rearranging deckchairs\" and \"getting a new captain\", I always find it interesting when people use maritime analogies when they talk about leadership.</p> <p>But it wasn't the captain that sank the Titanic - a ship they claimed was unsinkable - it was the iceberg. The best way to avoid disaster is to manage your way around the problem.</p> <p>And speaking as someone who's served on a ship and in a leadership, the best person to steer us through is a captain with the experience to navigate through these stormy financial global seas.</p> <p>For me, it's all about setting the right course. That's why I've always favoured policy over personality and why I believe Gordon's the right captain.</p> </blockquote> <p>Oh dear. Some of the papers have had a field day. </p> <p>Prescott later made a point of saying that he was writing his posts himself, and not relying upon party officials to do it for him. I think we can safely assume that he was telling the truth.</p> <p>For the record, the captain of the Titanic was Edward J Smith. I had always assumed that he was in part to blame for the sinking, because he was sailing too fast in treacherous waters, but I've just consulted Professor Wikipedia, who seems to suggest that the main problem was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic\">iceberg warnings not reaching the bridge</a>.</p>",
  "<p>I had no idea, when I went online to make my first blog post just six years ago, how proud I would come to feel about being a blogger. Initially, I didn't even tell old friends and family my blog address (<a href=\"http://www.isaacmao.com\">isaacmao.com</a>). The reason was that I was afraid to come across as sticking my neck out to be very different from the mainstream: traditionally in Chinese culture, it's better to keep new ventures low-key to avoid losing face if they fail.</p> <p>That first post, on August 5 2002, was little more than a simple announcement saying \"From today, I'm stepping into the blogosphere\". What then happened was impossible to imagine: just like in a fairy story, you planted some seeds and woke up one morning to find they had grown into a forest.</p> <p>In the case of my initial blogging, I think of it as <em>huozhong</em>, a \"seed fire\", which soon attracted other new bloggers. Zheng, a vocational school teacher in a remote city in Fujian province, found my blog while looking around on Google and sent a comment saying he too was interested in this new format where people could set up personal web logs and write about anything that interested them. </p> <h2>Bloggers' handbook</h2> <p>Chatting online, we became friends, and discovered we were both interested in compiling an online handbook to introduce blogging to more Chinese people. That simple idea got us working together to create a group blog site for the purpose - which is how cnblog.org was born. </p> <p>We subtitled the site \"Blog on Blog\" and we blogged every day to show people in China how easy it was to create their own blog and use it for writing or exchanging information about almost anything: starting a new career, pregnancy and childbearing, preparing a thesis, and so forth.</p> <p>Things went faster than we imagined. The group blog site collected more than 50 guest bloggers from all over the country to talk about the changes that could be brought about by forms of personal publishing in our particular society. </p> <p>Observing developments in China's blogosphere and talking about blogging became an important part of my blog content. By the end of 2002, there were more than a thousand bloggers in China, and at cnblog.org we knew almost every one of them. </p> <h2>Word of mouth</h2> <p>By the end of 2007, there were 47 million bloggers in China, the whole blogosphere having expanded itself exponentially by what you could call online word of mouth. Now China may well be, in absolute numbers, the largest blogging country in the world (while having the second largest population of internet users, at 160 million, according to the quasi-official China Internet Network Information Center, after the United States at 190 million).</p> <p>From that you can picture what an explosion of Chinese bloggers there was during 2003-2007. Whether I was, as people have sometimes said, mainland China's \"first blogger\", is hard to track - though I can't find any other bloggers in Google on that August day when I published my first blog post. What I know is that I feel very lucky to have been the one witnessing the whole process from the very beginning.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336228312\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2008/08/04/isaacmao220.jpg\" alt=\"Chinese blogger Isaac Mao\" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Isaac Mao: pictured at the Guardian's Future of Journalism conference. Photograph: David Levene</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene /Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During our early debates on the functions of blogging for Chinese society, there were many flame wars online. One IT commentator nicknamed \"Keso\", for instance, published an article in a popular internet community satirising the passion of pioneer bloggers and predicting that the phenomenon would be short-lived, \"just like a fashion show\". </p> <p>Bloggers responded in defence of their format. Interestingly, after a year of contestation, Keso became a blogger too, realising he could publish his ideas better through a blog than via chatrooms or bulletin board systems (BBS). He is now one of the most famous IT bloggers in China.</p> <p>These days, the sheer number of people blogging in China is having an impact in itself. First, many traditional media in China now quote frequently from blogs. Some of them also discover news sources in the blogosphere - otherwise, they risk losing valuable first-hand information. Second, blogs are always linking to each other and weaving a trust-based social media fabric. And as people increasingly use search engines to get important information, these engine-friendly social media are easily discovered by users.</p> <h2>The new individual</h2> <p>At the same time, this shift of media power has transformed many bloggers into a new generation of celebrity in the past six years. China has a long tradition of people trying to fit into the group, moderating their behaviour to avoid standing out conspicuously - a culture reinforced by the man-made collectivism of the past half-century. </p> <p>Blogs have leapfrogged this tradition, acting as a catalyst to encourage young people to become more individual. So this and other grassroots media are now emerging strongly to challenge China's social legacy.</p> <p>Even so, it's not entirely easy to blog freely, especially in a country with media controls like China. In 2005, my blog was blocked because I posted an article relating to the Chinese censorship system - probably the most complicated in the world. </p> <p>This \"<a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/digitalcontent/2008/07/the_great_firewall_of_china_ca.html\">Great Firewall</a>\" or \"Kung Fu Net\", as China's internet users call it can effectively block any web pages including keywords considered sensitive by the authorities (such as \"Tian'an Men\", \"Censorship\", etc). </p> <p>If you try to access such a page, the system will return a \"reset\" message and temporarily render the whole site unaccessible. There are also whole sites that are permanently blacklisted, including those of certain human rights groups or dissident blogs. As social problems have emerged in the past six years, the blacklist has become longer and longer.</p> <p>In my blocked blog, I was analysing the technical details of the system. When the system automatically detected this content, my blog was unplugged the next day. I had to suspend blogging for about 80 days, until I moved my site to a host service abroad. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336228313\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2008/08/05/mao.com220.jpg\" alt=\"Isaac Mao's blog\" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Isaac Mao's blog</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But I came to see that this intervention had a lucky side: because it hurt my social capital online, it forced me to rethink some of my everyday assumptions. I became a stronger confronter to any kinds of censorship from then on.</p> <p>Aware nowadays of Great Firewall - which quite matches its physical namesake, a legacy of the First Emperor - there are many Chinese bloggers who now have their blogs hosted overseas to prevent harassment by local authorities. </p> <p>So, albeit in a roundabout way, freedom of speech is being realised in this \"guesting\" way. We hope we can return to host sites in China some day, after our domestic internet businesses reject the compromises of self-censorship.</p> <h2>Letter to Google</h2> <p>Some months ago I wrote an open letter on my blog to the founders of Google, arguing that Google is now losing its fame among the formerly loyal user community in China because it is making compromises with censorship by filtering content considered sensitive or immoral from search results - even going so far as to remove some people's names from its index database. </p> <p>People posted hot comments in response to my letter - some taking issue but most in support. However, there has yet to be a response from Google (or Google China). It did no more than display, six months after the open letter, a message acknowledging that it filtered some results. </p> <p>Such an abuse of technology has angered a number of Chinese bloggers, who see it as a dilution a dilution of the search engine's \"Don't be evil\" motto. This in turn is almost certainly one of the factors behind Google's loss of market share in China, where its use rate accounts for less than 25%, a slide of several percentage points since 2005. <br> A Chinese blogger called \"Zola\" recently posted interesting home-made video clips on YouTube recording his verbal ambush of Google China's president, Lee Kai-Fu, at a local hotel where the executive was participating in a forum on the internet in China. Questioned persistently by Zola on Google's self-censorship policy, Lee cut short his remarks and exited hastily, protected by bodyguards.</p> <p>Unfortunately, I've heard from my international blogger friends that such things are happening everywhere. Episodes like this have made me realise why universal values can't be applied anywhere in the short term (and why a great company can find it hard to become greater). Looking at the experience in my homeland, I also believe the abuses of censorship produce a certain level of social fear - which leads to less creativity.</p> <h2>Online fame</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336228314\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2008/08/05/mao_220.jpg\" alt=\"Isaac Mao\" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Isaac Mao. Photograph: Martin Godwin/Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just like everywhere, too, I've seen blogs changing people's personal lives in many ways in China. An obvious one is the impact that a blog's fame can have on its originator. Zheng, my first blogger friend who was a teacher in a remote city, now is working as chief operating officer of a social networking website. </p> <p>Serving as chief technology officer in the same business is Bruce Wang, another blogger friend. Various other friends friends have easily found new jobs through their blogging - or even become happy couples. In other words, blogging has brought a higher quality of life to people I know. I sometimes use it to try to solve life problems, or help other friends to solve their problems.</p> <p>So what I've witnessed in these six years is not only the explosion in big numbers of users and media space, but also these individual effects - including in my life. I'm now more like a global citizen than six years ago. </p> <p>International bloggers from different countries became my friends by interacting over blogosphere. It is about trust because when bloggers share their minds they are also sharing the richness of their personal history \u2013 not only past and present, but their expectations too.</p> <p>With such trust and understanding, borders won't be geographical any more. Rebecca MacKinnon, who was CNN's Beijing bureau chief and loved Chinese culture, transformed herself into an independent blogger. We became best friends and share information regularly. We also collaborate on some interesting projects such as Global Voices Online, which she co-founded.</p> <p>Another famous blogger I met in the blogosphere is Joichi Ito, a Japanese-American. We both come from a technical background, and we both belong to the army of people whose blogging has led them into becoming entrepreneurs, working with venture-capital investors looking to back internet start-ups. </p> <p>We exchanged ideas about fostering conversations between young Chinese and Japanese bloggers to reach more understandings over the historical dispute between the two countries. And Carol Lin, who is called \"queen of micro-blogging\" in Taiwan, helps me understand how people with different political backgrounds can understand each other.</p> <p>The blog is such a good conversation tool that I believe it can help enrich people's perception of the world - a medium without the constraints of space and mindset that limit traditional media without being misled by poor few.</p> <h2>Tolerance through blogging</h2> <p>Blogging can also help people to become modest and tolerant - at first, I was easily annoyed by readers' remarks when I thought I was right, but over time I've learned a lot from their comments, which has made me more moderate in reacting to them. </p> <p>An entrepreneur posted some very nasty comments on my blog when I wrote something pointing out design problems with his product. He was very young at that time. Instead of firing back, I just posted further explanations. </p> <p>Hundreds of reader comments supported my post, and eventually, realising he'd been stupid and almost lost a great opportunity to improve his product, the guy apologised to me. He is now running a quite big business in China.</p> <p>I would also say this process has made me more rational, and more inclined to think in depth. It seems to me that the language and qualities of blogging are a kind of \"Modern Chinese\". </p> <p>In the early internet phase, there appeared a lot of bulletin boards and online forums susceptible to being inundated with nationalist diatribes and online \"Dazibao\" [wall posters] by some people lacking independence of thought. Today, I think many Chinese bloggers are transferring themselves into Modern Chinese by continuous inputting and outputting their thoughts online.</p> <p>When I started the blogging journey, I was motivated by a vague belief that it could improve my learning skills. I still think that is true, but perhaps the most charming part of blogging is the power of extending your borders in ways that you didn't plan or intend.</p> <p>Sometimes it's even magical. Blogging about different parts of your life, you can come to know people you never expected to encounter. All the while, reading and writing blog posts expands your knowledge base. </p> <p>Occasionally, artists found me via my blog because they loved some of the scripts I wrote about daily life. Some policemen found me and asked to meet me because they disliked points I was making opposing \"censorship\". And more, I've got to know many entrepreneurs and professionals online through sharing ideas.</p> <h2>The privacy issue</h2> <p>A lot of people are reluctant to become a blogger just because of their concerns about so-called \"privacy\", their worry that \"leaking\" their personal life to the general public will lead to them being annoyed by other people. I had the same concern for a long time. In the early days, I would think of what consequences every blog post might generate before I clicked the \"publish\" button.</p> <p>But now this concern has faded away. Anyone, I've realised, can well control his/her privacy on a blog. The content I share online using my real identity is actually neither private stuff nor public. It is a new space called \"social space\". Of course, the blog can be viewed publicly - but in practice the viewers are those who are interested in my blog and trust me the same way I trust the society.</p> <p>It's a different mindset that one can feel after blogging for a period of time. I call this philosophy \"<a href=\"http://www.picnicnetwork.org/page/18409/en\">Sharism</a>\", and it can be practised by anyone because the rewards are easy to see. You share one piece of knowledge and then could come a time of returns (maybe not immediately, but with many magic happenings in the future). </p> <p>The sharism spirit can currently be found in any so called \"Web 2.0\" phenomena - Wikipedia is just one example, created from the collective intelligence by many people around the world based on their sharing philosophy. </p> <p>In a more metaphysical view, your blog can act as a halo (to borrow a term from gaming) to shine more lights to the world and coupled with other people's halo at the same time. This has spawned more imaginations in my mind of future society where everyone can be sharist and all the brains are well connected to form a smarter society like a social brain - though given the controls and obstacles that still confront blogging, it is going to be a long road to reach the social-brain dream.</p> <p>Meanwhile, I've seen my own blogging evolve in several ways. In my first two years, I was spending more than three hours a day to develop from beginner into a skilled blogger, and seemed totally addicted to blogging. Nowadays, I have redefined my daily timetable to mix more offline life with blogging habits. So I'm not a slave of blogging. I think I enjoy a new lifestyle of being \"both high tech and high touch\". You could call it life 2.0. </p> <p>Along the road I've also set up a range of separate blogs, reflecting different purposes or targeting different audiences. On them, since that first post, I've published 2,300 articles. My next step, however, may be to try to merge them again into one life-log. I'm also managing to post on some group blogs to collaborate on interesting topics. </p> <p>And I'm regularly blogging in non-text formats - pictures, audio/video clips and more fun stuff. Just in this passing year, I got totally addicted to a new type of blogging -Microblogging, which enables me to blog any time with a short piece of ideas or meme (a concept to describe micro ideas). I find it an easier way to share small pieces of ideas with trusted friends and make life-log possible. One of the fancy things about blog is 'permanent' link which is for other people to link back to your post. So I even posted a totally blank post occupying a link. </p> <p>I carry on trying to persuade all sorts of people to start blogging, without insisting they should follow any particular code - everybody has the right to share whatever they want, though I think they should understand how to keep a balance that avoids infringing others. It's a process of finding the \"larger you\" step by step.</p> <p>Today, as a blogger with six years' experience, there's no question of downplaying what I do. I can confidently print my blog address on my name card and tell other people I'm first a blogger, then a businessman. These changes are not just due to the passage of time, but also to the attitude of millions of bloggers in China towards \"the new\" - new ideas, new subjects, and the whole outside world. </p> <p>I'm more likely to share new stuff than six years ago, because I think there are more benefits than risks in sharing. There have been growing pains, but I wish and believe that - for us in China and people everywhere - the blog will eventually become a lifelong partner.</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediaguardian.co.uk\">editor@mediaguardian.co.uk</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p>At this time of year, it looks green, bursting with promise. The road from the county town of Soroti is straight and brown and businesslike. It is part of a trunk route running from Mombasa in Kenya to the east, all the way to Southern Sudan and Congo in the north.</p> <p>Major works are underway, local men in global Kevlar supervised by the Chinese who won the contract to rebuild the road. They are blowing up a hillside for rock to serve as foundations. Last week a child blew his arm off when he played with a stick of something unexploded. Yet, under the kind blue sky, through the window of a speeding land cruiser, it seems to be a countryside on the brink of lift-off.</p> <p>But then you start to talk to the people and you learn what they have survived, and how little they have in physical, emotional and tangible resources to start again.</p> <p>Almost every one of the lives of the dozen or so people we talked to today has been blighted by one instance or another of the twenty years of insecurity from the 1980s until 2004: local insurrection, cattle thieves taking advantage of local lawlessness, and the Lord's Resistance Army (ditto).</p> <p>We talked to mothers in their thirties who had lost the chance of an education and a professional future because of the Karamajong raids of the 1980s and 1990s that took their father's livelihood and their school uniforms. So no chance of becoming teachers or nurses, and for one, a disastrous marriage instead.</p> <p>We talked to parents of children whose illnesses had gone undiagnosed and untreated because of the sheer impossibility of reaching hospital in the midst of unrest. We talked to farmers painstakingly reconstructing their lives through hard work and courage. And to a boy who had spent two months captured by the Lord's Resistance Army, believing each day would be his last.</p> <p>It raises all sorts of challenging uncertainties. Of course Amref is right, giving people the skills to get what they need from government - and from the soil - is vital. But it is so slow. These are very very poor people. They need money, some little seed fund that they can convert into capital again, whether it is an ox or better seed or better implements.</p> <p>But then you learn that cotton, once the mainstay of the region, was grown here until as late as 2006 when the price dropped so low it no longer made sense, and you realise they need marketing expertise, perhaps help to recreate the co-op selling organisations that once ensured a decent return and of course a decent result from Doha.</p> <p>And it is wonderful that children can go to primary school, but essential that a way is found to send every child on to secondary too, so they can either make a real contribution to their community or move into town to some kind of employment with a future.</p> <p>I have sat with half a dozen children today who know that they have at most another year of school, and no chance of finding the money to pay for the next round, the round that will get them on the ladder of a medical career, or a life as a teacher.</p> <p>And I have sat with parents who cannot get the medicine their children need - cannot even get a diagnosis that they have confidence in. The seven year old with the agonising skin condition, the baby with that heart-jerking whimper instead of a real howl, the boy with the painful eye condition.</p> <p>One more thought. Most of the people we have talked to find their only comfort and their only inspiration in their church. It deters one lone parent from brewing beer, a bitter young man from seeking revenge and it provides life-saving support for an old woman who cannot stand. The churches are doing work the government does not. Church and charity. Time to review some old ideas.</p>",
  "<p>This summer, Swedish Red Cross Youth (<a href=\"http://rkuf.se/section.php?type=1&amp;article=483\">RKUF</a>) launched a global <a href=\"http://commercial-archive.com/node/144565\">campaign</a> to encourage people to discuss China's human rights record. (Note that, in July, the campaign was pulled by the Red Cross HQ in Geneva.) For the <a href=\"http://www.resume.se/nyheter/2008/06/16/os-grenar-och-valdshandlin/\">campaign</a>, RKUF chose five photographs apparently showing Chinese police attacking protestors. Each picture was then marked with a pictogram representing an Olympic sport. The ads carried the line: \"Arranging the Olympic games is not a human right. Continue the discussion at RKUF.se.\" </p> <p>Simon Brouwers, head of communications at RKUF, said in a statement: \"Right now when China is hosting the Olympic games with one hand, and shutting down protests in Tibet with the other, it was a perfect time to highlight the topic \u2026 \" </p> <p>Let's leave for another day for the discussion of whether a supposedly non-partisan organisation such as the Red Cross should stick its nose into politics. I want to talk about the credibility lost after the fundamental error that RKUF made on this campaign. </p> <p>The pictures used apparently showed human rights abuses by the Chinese government and its military force. However, three of the pictures were, in fact, taken in Nepal, and the soldiers in blue uniforms were Nepalese, not Chinese as the ads implied. What about the other two photographs, you ask? Well, they were indeed taken in China, but not at any protest, unrest or \"crackdown\". They were actually taken at an anti-terrorist drill and an anti-illegal stowaway mission carried out by the Chinese military, in the run-up to the Olympics. </p> <p>I got in touch with the RKUF, and pointed out this error to Brouwers \u2013 remember he's the <em>head</em> of communications. He replied with this explanation: </p> <blockquote> <p>The picture is from Tibet. It was taken at an anti-China demonstration outside the Chinese embassy in Lhasa, where the Tibetan police attacked the protestors with riot sticks.</p> </blockquote> <p>I am still appalled by the lack of basic knowledge on the issue that he and his team were supposed to be campaigning about. He doesn't even know that there isn't a \"Chinese embassy in Lhasa\". It makes me wonder if he even knows where Lhasa is. </p> <p>After a few rounds of emails between myself, Brouwers and the head of RKUF, they admitted that they had made an error and apologised. However, they chose to stick to their guns and keep running the campaign as if nothing had happened. RKUF insisted that this campaign is not anti-China, but pro-human rights. Come on, you can't have your cake and eat it too. By referring directly to the Beijing Olympics and choosing these pictures, the campaign is obviously pointing a finger at China. If RKUF's intention was to stimulate a debate on human rights issues around the globe, wouldn't it be more appropriate to use a wider range of photographs, including images, for example, of the abuse of Guant\u00e1namo Bay prisoners? </p> <p>I am the first to admit that human rights records, along with many other issues in China, need to be addressed and improved. However, the irresponsible and ignorant approach that the RKUF took is only going to dampen the efforts. Recently, there has been a wave of unprecedented nationalism from the Chinese all over the world, condemning western-biased views of China and its policies. The Chinese are asking the question: \"Why the hatred?\" People marching down San Francisco's streets chanting \"free Tibet\" can't even point out where Tibet is on a world map; the Olympics' torch protection squad sent by Beijing and authorised by the IOC were labeled \"thugs\" by the chairman of the London organising committee for the Olympic games \u2013 I didn't hear anyone calling the French \"thugs\" when they showed up in their military uniforms during last year's Tour de France for the same peacekeeping purposes? Why the hatred? Why are so many people in the west, the Chinese ask, so eager to jump on this moral bandwagon and punch China in the face without the basic understanding of the country, its culture or its people? </p> <p>I admire people's desire to do something for a good cause, and to have a belief, but ask yourself how much you know about the matter first: educate yourselves before lecturing other people.</p>",

Barclays is due to report first-half results on Thursday, with analysts predicting a large fall in pre-tax profits from \u00a34.1bn last time to around \u00a32.6bn.</p> <p>The deal came as Swiss Re announced a weaker-than-expected second-quarter net profit and also a mark-to-market loss on structured credit default swaps of SFr362m (\u00a3176m) in the second quarter.</p> <p>Unlike many other reinsurers - which reinsure risk for other insurance companies - Swiss Re has taken a battering from the credit crunch. Total writedowns are now up to around SFr2.7bn in its financial services unit, which creates products to transfer risk to capital markets.</p> <p>But chief executive, Jacques Aigrain said the deal showed Swiss Re was strong enough to take advantage of tough markets.</p> <p>\"The difficult market environment also creates new opportunities,\" he said. \"Swiss Re has the execution capability and capital strength to seize these opportunities.\"</p> <p>The poor results and fear of more writedowns hit Swiss Re shares during early trading, although they later recovered.

Global stock prices are a fifth lower than their October 2007 peaks - with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/05/stockmarkets.creditcrunch\">the FTSE 100 index dropping by 16.7% in a year</a> - but they still hover at levels last seen in 2006 when markets were far less gripped by fear.</p> <p>He was surprised that has been any global economic growth at all given the circumstances of the crisis, which he described as \"a once or twice a century event deeply rooted in fears of insolvency of major institutions\".</p> <p>He said much of this was due to globalisation which has been at the root of the past decade's unprecedented surge in economic activity. </p> <p>As a result, he expressed concern that the governments may panic and seek contain competitive markets with heavy-handed regulation to try protect themselves from the financial crisis. </p> <p>\"If that becomes widespread, globalisation could reverse - at awesome cost,\" he said, suggesting that share prices around the globe could fall sharply.<br></p>",
  "<p>Despite significant pressure from the United States, Britain, France and Germany, in the six months since it declared independence Kosovo has been recognised by just 43 of the 192 members of the United Nations. While this tally includes many of the world's most influential states \u2013 including 20 of the 27 members of the European Union, and other leading western states such as Canada and Australia \u2013 support from elsewhere has been marginal. Kosovo has been recognised by just six states from south and central America and Africa. Asian endorsements stand at Japan, South Korea, Afghanistan and a couple of Pacific microstates. </p> <p>This low count reflects a deep sense of concern over Kosovo's legal right to independence. While those states that have recognised it argue that Kosovo represents a unique case in international politics, most countries evidently continue to harbour real doubts about recognising a move that has not been accepted by Serbia (the state on whose territory Kosovo has been created), or endorsed by the UN security council.<br> It is against this backdrop that Serbia is now preparing to launch its most significant and controversial diplomatic initiative to date. Boris Tadic, the Serbian president, has just <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/bondsNews/idUSFIL35845520080803\">confirmed</a> that next month Belgrade intends to seek the UN general assembly's support for an advisory opinion from the international court of justice on <a href=\"http://www.chathamhouse.org.uk/files/11547_il220408.pdf\">the legality of independence</a> and on its recognition. To succeed, it needs 96 votes. This is not an impossible target. Already it appears to have the support of many leading non-western states, such as Russia, China, India, South Africa, Indonesia and Brazil. Meanwhile, faced with pressure from both sides, many other countries would simply welcome impartial guidance on the matter. <br> Although any opinion would be non-binding, if the court were to rule in Serbia's favour - and many believe that there is a good chance that it would - it would mark a severe setback for further efforts to legitimise Kosovo's statehood. While some countries, such as the United States, might just hold their ground on recognition regardless of the court's opinion, many others would come under real pressure, domestically and internationally, to rescind their decision. In the meantime, it seems unlikely that Kosovo would receive any further recognition. Under these circumstances, Serbia is now coming under pressure to drop its plans to pursue the case. Already, Washington has warned against such a move. So too have leading members of the EU. A few weeks ago, Bernard Kouchner, the French foreign minister, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;rls=GWYA,GWYA:2005-37,GWYA:en&amp;q=ICJ+Kosovo+Kouchner\">called on Serbia</a> to drop its plans. More recently, the British ambassador in Belgrade also <a href=\"http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2008&amp;mm=08&amp;dd=03&amp;nav_id=52409\">urged</a> the Serbian government to reconsider its plan. Calling the move a \"mistake\", he argued that it represented a \"direct challenge to the EU\" and suggested that it would make cooperation between the EU and Serbia more difficult. Privately, some EU officials have <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?story_id=11585306\">indicated</a> that it could even damage Serbia's EU accession prospects.<br> However, EU members must avoid being seen to strong-arm Serbia into backing down on this issue. Such moves will only reflect badly on the EU as a whole. For a start, and most obviously, by trying to stop Serbia from going to the ICJ it rather suggests that many states maintain real doubts over the legality of their decision to recognise Kosovo. Second, having taking an uncompromising stand on Serbia's full cooperation with the ICTY as a precondition for membership, it would not look good for EU members to demand that their own actions be exempt from legal scrutiny on the grounds of political expediency.</p> <p>But there are bigger issues at stake. After insisting that the states of the Balkans must not resort to armed force in managing their disputes, and having explicitly warned Serbia not to do so in the case of Kosovo, it is illogical, if not fundamentally wrong, now to try to close off the most peaceful and legitimate methods of conflict resolution. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, at a time when EU members are emphasising the importance of international law in global politics, and are seeking to strengthen the institutions of international justice, it sends out the message that they are unwilling to subject they own actions to legal oversight.</p> <p>It is understandable why those countries that have supported independence are worried by the prospect of an ICJ hearing on the matter. However, by pressuring Serbia to drop its plan, they only serve to entrench doubts about the legitimacy of Kosovo's declaration of independence, and, in the case of EU members, undermine the European Union's wider foreign policy goals in the Balkans and beyond.</p>",
