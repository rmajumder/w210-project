  "<p>The urgency of the US administration's bail-out was highlighted yesterday when global money markets all but froze in one of their worst days since the credit crisis erupted. Central banks around the world were again forced to pump in yet more billions of liquidity in an attempt to get banks lending to each other again.</p> <p>Stress in the markets showed up everywhere but especially in three-month London interbank offered rates which rose to 5.06% for euro funds - the highest since November 2000. The premiums of Libor rates over expected central bank rates three months from now hit record highs for sterling and dollar funds.</p> <p>The US Federal Reserve moved for the second day running to inject $30bn through currency swaps with other central banks. The Bank of England and European Central Bank and Bank of Japan made similar moves.</p> <p>Analysts think prolonged delay to the adoption of the US bail-out by Congress could lead to fresh runs on banks' shares and more bank failures, threatening the world economy with a prolonged recession.</p>",
  "<p>The prime minister's call for a \"new settlement for new times\" provides the basis for a new debate on the challenges facing Labour in government and the country (Brown: up close and personal, September 24).</p> <p>This should move beyond the New Labour/Old Labour debate. New Labour correctly identified the key challenges facing the centre left in an era of globalisation. Many of the policy tools it came up with have served their purpose and are exhausted. The current era of global turbulence requires new ways of managing risk and promoting security. </p> <p>There are different views in the Labour party on the shape of the new settlement, but this is what we should be discussing if we want to convince the country we deserve a fourth term. For those MPs who think personality matters more than policy, can I point out that this is already on offer to the electorate in the shape of David Cameron?</p> <p>Progressive politics is rooted in attempts to understand what is wrong with the world, how to change it for the better and how to involve people in that fight. Belief in the central role of the supreme leader - good or bad - is the prerogative of the right and the far left.<br><strong>Councillor Steve Munby</strong><br>Labour, Liverpool city council</p> <p>At this time of world economic crisis the UK is fortunate to have a leader of Gordon Brown's experience and stature. There will soon be a new US president, France has a new president, and the leaders of Germany and Spain are both relative newcomers to power. Consequently, Gordon Brown is likely to play a leading role in the financial deliberations that will affect us all in the years ahead. This is a time for serious politics not courting the media spotlight, and I think Brown is the right man in the right job.<br><strong>Phil D'Arcy</strong><br>Aberdeen</p> <p>I'm sorry, Gordon, you may have swung the faithful, but I'm afraid your speech was all hot air. When you have to choose between keeping the fat cats sweet and helping the needy, we all know which way you'll go. Will you regulate the City? Will you tax the wealthy? Will you tax the non-doms? Will you drop ID cards? Will you scrap Trident renewal? Will you adopt a policy that encourages industry? Will you build council houses? The answer to all these questions will be maybe a little, but not a lot. </p> <p>The problem is that you've given away too much power. Virtually all the things that are wrong in Britain are a result of relinquishing too much power to the wealthy by means of privatisation and private finance initiatives. Despite your speech, the polls will continue to show your party out of favour not because the Tories have the right ideas, but because you and your party lack the basic ideological beliefs and the courage to put them into practice. <br><strong>Rod White</strong><br>Dursley, Gloucestershire</p> <p>Sarah Brown's introduction of her husband to the Labour conference is a further step to dynastic assumptions about leadership. It is also sexist. </p> <p>The media only see \"balance\" as between the leaders, rather than between the various opinions within any party. Intra-party differences are always presented as \"splits\" or \"challenges\". This concentrates power in the hands of the leaders, who can claim that any opinions, different to their own, will reduce poll ratings and therefore all will suffer. It is an indication of how blithely the media have accepted this concentration of power that they have been largely uncritical of this new development. Sarah Brown should be heard as a delegate in her own right, not as a support act.<br><strong>Rob Wheway</strong><br>The Liberal Institute</p> <p>Brown still doesn't \"get it\" with the continued reference to \"hard working families\". What about those of us in relationships with no kids, or who are gay, single, the unemployed, the elderly, the divorced? We are excluded from their thoughts, policy and political discourse. </p> <p>I shall not vote Labour - or for any other party - until they \"speak\" to me. At the moment none of them do, and that applies to millions of other voters, and we're fed up with it.<br><strong>Dave Massey</strong><br>London</p>",
  "<p>The US government has yielded to an outcry over multimillion-dollar Wall Street pay packets by agreeing to impose limits on the remuneration of senior bankers who benefit from a $700bn bail-out of financial institutions.</p> <p>The treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, bowed to pressure after two days of tough negotiations with congressional legislators who are reluctant to pass his programme to buy up banks' distressed assets without a crackdown on perceived boardroom excess.</p> <p>\"The American people are angry about executive compensation, and rightly so,\" Paulson told the House of Representatives financial services committee. \"We must find a way to address this in legislation without undermining the effectiveness of the programme.\"</p> <p>The concession, which is likely to fuel momentum for similar measures in Britain, came as the Bush administration battled to overcome scepticism about the biggest public intervention in the financial markets since the Great Depression. </p> <p>Polls suggested that the US public are unenthusiastic about the bail-out, and Wall Street stocks slipped on doubts over the likelihood of a deal. In an attempt to marshal support, the White House said President George Bush would make a televised address about the crisis.</p> <p>Measures to reduce pay packages are set to include severe restrictions on \"golden parachutes\" given to executives when they leave. Wall Street sources expect a clawback on bonuses if companies restate their financial performance, and laws to ban performance-related incentives which encourage inappropriate risk.</p> <p>Such changes are an about-turn for a laissez-faire administration which last year rejected congressional attempts to give shareholders a British-style \"say on pay\" vote. A crackdown poses a personal dilemma for Paulson, who earned $38m as head of Goldman Sachs in 2005.</p> <p>In heated exchanges on the issue, Democratic congressman Luis Guitterez told Paulson: \"We are asking American taxpayers to sacrifice, to put $700bn out there when other people are lining their pockets.\" Paulson replied: \"People in the country understand pay for performance for success - that's the American dream. But nobody understands pay for failure.\"</p> <p>Critics of Wall Street point out that the Lehman Brothers chief executive Dick Fuld received nearly $35m in pay last year. Merrill Lynch's former boss Stan O'Neal left with $161m in stock and options when he was ousted due to huge losses on subprime mortgages in October.</p> <p>A poll released by the Los Angeles Times and Bloomberg shows that 55% of Americans oppose government aid to failing financial firms. CNN found that 62% of Americans support government involvement in the markets, but 65% believe that a bail-out would be unfair to taxpayers.</p> <p>A sense of public anger at Wall Street's role in causing the meltdown was fuelled by news that the FBI was investigating the possibility of fraud at four firms caught up in the financial turmoil - AIG, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Lehman Brothers.</p> <p>Paulson is staying in Washington to continue defending the administration's plan and has turned down an invitation to meet Gordon Brown in New York today.</p> <p>The Bush administration delivered increasingly dire warnings of the consequences of inactivity. The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, said global markets were under \"extraordinary stress\" and action was \"urgently required\". The White House press secretary, Dana Perino, said there was a risk of \"financial calamity\" as \"the cold on Wall Street could affect Main Street\".</p> <p>As concern grew in the markets, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 29 points to 10,825. Morgan Stanley's shares slumped 11% as takeover talks with the commercial banking group Wachovia ended. Deutsche Bank analysts said the market was \"skittish\" on concerns that the US treasury might get less than$700bn, with the possibility of strings attached.</p> <p>Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup, said \"bail-out fatigue\" was setting in. \"A real sense of crisis has eluded many members [of Congress] who may not fully grasp the linkage between financial markets and their impact on the people who elect their representatives in government,\" he told clients in a letter.</p>",
  "<p>The scare over Chinese dairy products reached Britain yesterday as Tesco announced it was removing milk sweets from its shelves as a precautionary measure. New Zealand authorities have warned the White Rabbit brand contains \"unacceptable\" levels of melamine.</p> <p>At least 12 countries, from Indonesia to Kenya to Colombia, have now banned Chinese dairy imports amid fears sparked by tainted milk powder which has killed four Chinese babies and made tens of thousands ill, including five in Hong Kong and Macau. Around 100 are still in serious condition.</p> <p>Several more countries have stepped up testing after melamine, which can cause kidney stones and even kidney failure, was found in products ranging from fresh milk to cakes and biscuits. The chemical, used in making plastics and fertilizer, boosts apparent protein levels in tests.</p> <p>So far all the cases of illness have been linked to infant formula from Sanlu, the company at the heart of the scandal. Products from other large dairy firms showed lower levels of the substance.</p> <p>A senior Chinese product safety official insisted that the problem was \"under control, more or less\" and Premier Wen Jiabao, speaking on a visit to New York, said the government would use the crisis as an opportunity to overhaul safety controls.</p> <p>\"There is no problem,\" Xiang Yuzhang, the quality watchdog's chief inspection official, told reporters in Beijing. \"There are no more problems in the market.\"</p> <p>Tesco yesterday said it had withdrawn White Rabbit Creamy Candies - sold in a small number of its stores - but had no evidence they were tainted.</p> <p>Hours later New Zealand's Food Safety Authority warned it had found unacceptable contamination in the imported sweets. \"This product contains sufficiently high levels of melamine which may cause health problems,\" deputy chief executive Sandra Daly said. She urged people to seek medical advice if they or their children had eaten the sweets, adding: \"This is a serious concern.\"</p> <p>Singapore's Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority had already reported the presence of melamine. </p> <p>Since the scandal emerged two weeks ago worldwide bans and checks have spread from dairy products to those which may contain milk.</p> <p>The European Union does not allow Chinese dairy imports but has already urged customs authorities to intensify checks on products such as bread and chocolate. A Chinese official apologised to consumers in Taiwan as authorities there ordered Chinese-made milk products and vegetable-based proteins off store shelves pending testing.</p> <p>Indonesia warned that retailers faced up to five years in jail and a \u00a3100,000 fine if they failed to remove from sale 28 products - including Oreo cookies and M&amp;Ms - until testing is completed.</p> <p>Kraft Foods said Oreo products did not contain any dairy produce from China, while Mars, maker of M&amp;Ms, said it did not use ingredients from China's blacklisted firms. Australia advised citizens overseas to avoid all Chinese-made milk products, unless companies had confirmed their goods were free from contamination, and the US Food and Drug Administration has expanded its sampling of Asian imports to dairy-based candies and desserts. Malaysia ordered safety inspections for many Chinese food imports, including those without milk.</p> <p>Anthony Hazzard, a World Health Organization adviser on food security, said: \"I think the greatest fear is if there has been illegal movement of the heavily contaminated products rather than the legal movement of products that may have very low levels of melamine.\"</p> <p>Four years ago premier Wen apologised after the cover-up over SARS, and the government promised to toughen safety regimes last year, after a spate of product scares.</p> <p>But Yang Fengchun, of Peking University's School of Government, told the Associated Press news agency: \"Although after SARS the government promised a more open media environment and to protect people's right of expression, without essential measures it's just empty talk. What is really needed is to change the system's framework.</p>",

  "<p>You can tell a lot from someone's hair, and not just how often they wash. As it grows - at a rate of about a centimetre a month - it locks in information about your diet, environment and lifestyle.

  "<p>One Sunday in July, the images began to wink out on the popular micro-blogging service Twitter. The photo-sharing site SmugMug flashed up \"Service unavailable\". Jungle Disk, which advertises \"Reliable online storage\", stopped working. The reason: Amazon's Simple Storage Service, known as S3, went offline for up to eight hours. It was the second significant outage this year, following a similar but shorter incident in February.</p> <p>Amazon S3 is a celebrated example of cloud computing, meant to be the wave of the future. \"Using Amazon's S3 has about the same cost and complexity as hosting the images ourselves, but we had thought that the reliability of Amazon would be significantly higher. But that now seems wrong,\" said Lukas Biewald, who runs an image assessment service called FaceStat (<a href=\"http://www.bit.ly/cloudy2\">bit.ly/cloudy2</a>). Failures like this have a domino effect, and the more cloud computing catches on, the bigger the impact. Amazon does offer a service level agreement, but reimbursed fees are small compensation for loss of business.</p> <p>So what is cloud computing? \"There's a lot of confusion because everyone is tagging what they do with the word 'cloud'. It's the buzzword of the moment,\" says Tony Lucas, chief executive of XCalibre, a UK ISP which has created an on-demand computing service called FlexiScale (<a href=\"http://www.flexiscale.com\">flexiscale.com</a>). </p> <p><strong>Somewhere, nowhere</strong></p> <p>For some people, cloud computing simply means that their stuff is out there on the internet instead of being on a laptop or office server. A classic example is Google Mail - along with the word processing, spreadsheet and calendar applications called Google Apps - which can be used from any web browser. If your computer is stolen, the data remains safe on the net. Research shows that, at least in North America, 69% of web users make some use of such applications (<a href=\"http://www.bit.ly/cloudy3\">bit.ly/cloudy3</a>).</p> <p>Google's Chrome browser and its mobile phone operating system, called Android, are developed specifically to enable cloud computing. Features in Chrome include desktop shortcuts to websites, a fast scripting engines and a set of extensions called Gears which allow web applications, when suitably coded, to continue working even when offline (see panel). </p> <p>But cloud computing is not just about web applications. The idea behind businesses like FlexiScale is that instead of setting up their own computing infrastructure, businesses purchase it in the same way that they buy electricity and gas. The implications are far-reaching, and the industry giants are jostling for position. On August 1, IBM announced a $360m (\u00a3194m) data centre in North Carolina \"to enable IBM to deliver Cloud Computing capabilities to clients\". A few days earlier, HP, Intel and Yahoo had announced a joint test bed for cloud computing research and education. Dell has nabbed the URL <a href=\"http://www.cloudcomputing.com\">cloudcomputing.com</a> for its Data Center Solutions and tried (unsuccessfully) to register \"Cloud Computing\" as a trademark.</p> <p>Amazon, already a web retailing giant, is also a cloud computing pioneer. S3, launched in March 2006, behaves like an infinitely expandable hard drive. Developers can store and retrieve data without needing to worry about where it is physically located. \"S3 now has 14bn objects and 30,000 transactions a second,\" Jeff Barr of Amazon told a conference in London earlier this year. Later in 2006, S3 was joined by the Elastic Compute Cloud, or EC2, which lets users create virtual computers on the fly. \"You build a structure called an AMI, an Amazon Machine Image, and on that AMI you put your operating system, your applications and any data that you would like,\" Barr says. \"You take that whole AMI, copy it to S3, then we can launch one, 10, 50, however many you like.\" Amazon bills customers for virtual computers by the hour, and also charges for data storage and internet data transfer (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/aws\">amazon.com/aws</a>).</p> <p>According to Lucas, cloud computing is not only about saving money on servers. \"If you compare the cost of running a server on Flexiscale with a dedicated server of the same specification, you will save money but not a dramatic amount. It's more the flexibility. You can set up servers up straight away rather than having to wait for servers to be bought, delivered and installed and you've got the benefit of not having to have your own backup hardware.\"</p> <p>Cost-effective, scalable, green: cloud computing has a lot going for it. Unfortunately it can also be a single point of failure, as the S3 outage proves. There are other snags. Lock-in is a concern, particularly with offerings like <a href=\"http://www.Salesforce.com\">Salesforce.com</a>, specialists in customer relationship managemen (CRM), which has a capable but proprietary on-demand platform. Another problem is security, auditing and compliance. The location of personal and confidential data has legal implications, which does not fit well with services like S3 where customers are not meant to care where the data is actually stored.</p> <p><strong>Virtually there</strong></p> <p>Lucas agrees that reliability is a concern. \"I don't believe any business should take the risk that it couldn't happen,\" he says, adding that occasional large outages are actually more likely than minor ones. \"You'll find that no small failures occur, because that's what the redundancy is built in for, but what you will get very occasionally is a major failure.\" This happened to FlexiScale at the end of August, when human error took the entire platform offline for two days. Does that make cloud computing hopeless?</p> <p>Lucas says the key is to develop interoperability between clouds. \"We've got a customer who has half of what they run with us, and half of what they run with Amazon, and can switch between the two,\" he says. It is not easy to do this at present, but it could become so if standards were agreed between cloud providers. Lucas is optimistic. \"I see the interoperability problem being fixed, because it needs to be for this market to grow.\"</p> <p>Virtualisation, where several virtual computers run on a single physical computer, is increasingly popular within enterprises as well as up in the cloud. If all these systems were compatible, then businesses could move virtual servers between their premises and one or more cloud providers at will. \"Internal resources inside enterprises will be a cloud-type structure,\" Lucas says. \"You'll ask for the resources you need and they'll be automatically allocated, and you can outsource it to an external cloud instead of using your internal one.\"</p> <p>Virtualisation specialist VMware has just announced what it calls vCloud (<a href=\"http://www.bit.ly/cloudy4\">bit.ly/cloudy4</a>). This allows customers to run virtual data centres on the internet, and to move applications on demand between their on-premise servers and those on the internet. The cloud may yet be ready for business.</p> <h2>The Google view</h2> <p>\"I hate 'cloud computing',\" says Sam Schillace, Google's \"cloud advocate\" and founder of Writely, which became Google Docs. He thinks it's a horrible term, perhaps because it doesn't suggest any of the social aspects that make it useful. He says: \"We care about the social artefacts, not the technology. We care because the things we do online are about connecting with other people: email, instant messaging, blogging and so on.\" He says that 20 years ago, having an internet connection was unusual, but today, no one would want a computer that could not get online. </p> <p>Of course, not everybody can be connected all the time, so Google is trying to deal with the problems of being offline. One example is Google Gears, which, he says, \"is essentially a very rich browser cache, in some ways. And it reduces latency\" - the delays that come from communicating with a remote server. Gears gives web apps another gear. Schillace's job is to develop Google's cloud computing applications. \"There has to be a real trust relationship with users, built around privacy and security and change,\" he says. If people don't trust Google, they won't use its apps. So \"this company really does want to do the right thing\". <br><strong>Jack Schofield</strong></p>",
  "<p>The credit crunch is creating a new global hobby: trading down. People are cushioning the squeeze on their incomes by buying cheaper alternatives. This is already showing up in the results of food stores. Sainsbury's reported last week that sales of its Basics range had grown by 20%; three big discount food chains - Aldi, Netto and Lidl - have also increased sales by as much as a fifth. Anecdote suggests people are buying cheaper, more fuel-efficient cars and driving slower to squeeze more miles out of each gallon. Motorists who stick below 60mph on long journeys have been surprised by how far the savings offset the increased cost of petrol. Cutting down on restaurant visits can do wonders for a depressed family budget. So too can choosing tap water instead of the wasteful bottled variety, which new figures suggest more people have started to do. Harvey Nichols is the sort of shop more often associated with trading up; but at the grand opening of its Bristol store yesterday humble cupcakes and hot dogs were among the canap\u00e9s served - a culinary recognition of harder times, perhaps? Better still, as we report today, the wholesome turnip - the preferred vegetable of Blackadder's downtrodden Baldrick - is enjoying a surge in sales. None of this will revive the economy unless consumers buy enough extra cheap goods to offset the overall fall in spending; that is unlikely. But trading down is frequently tasty, and even more often green. It is an ill wind that blows nobody any good.</p>",

His village of Jelepara in the far south-west of Bangladesh is desperately poor and has no electricity, and the young fisherman was walking back with food for his family at about 8.15 in the evening. </p> <p>It was June 20 - monsoon season. Tarak was walking along the high earth embankment that protects Jelepara from the river Chunkuri, and had just passed a small Hindu temple with its gaudy, painted wooden effigies of the tiger god Dakshin Ray. He would not have seen the real tiger that had just swum across the river from the great Sunderbans forest 400 yards away. It hauled itself out of the water and mauled him from behind. No one even heard Tarak cry out. </p> <p>But that was just the start of the drama in Jelepara that night. According to Selina, a young woman who lives only a few hundred yards from the scene of the killing, the beast then dropped down off the embankment, and silently entered Gita Rani's family compound in the village. It tried to take a chicken, but Gita came out when she heard the commotion in the hen house and was promptly killed. </p> <p>The tiger then went into the house where it killed her father-in-law, Aghoire Mandal. \"Word spread fast that a man-eater was in the village,\" said Selina. \"Everyone was very frightened and angry. People came from all around and the tiger ran to another house half a kilometre away. There it killed some goats.\" Many villagers kept their doors shut and prayed that night, as others kept watch. When dawn came, the damage was counted: three people, two goats, and several chickens had been killed and the tiger was still in the village. </p> <p>But rather than call the government forest department, 40 miles away, and hope that they would send a marksman to shoot the tiger, the people of Jelepara set about hunting it. It proved to be a brave but brutal exercise. </p> <p>Now it was the animal's turn to run. First dozens of men tried to corner it, blocking off its escape routes and chasing it away from the village. The tiger was tracked through long grass and rice fields. Finally it leapt on the roof of a house. Film shot on a mobile phone by a villager shows the tiger looking perfectly relaxed. </p> <p>As people gathered for the spectacle of what would surely be a kill - either of animal or of humans - several men then climbed a tree above the house with a rope. Slowly they lowered a noose above the tiger's head and secured the rope to the tree. At a given moment, the villagers then all started shouting and the tiger leapt forward in a desperate attempt to escape. But the noose tightened, and the rope, held by the tree, steadily began to strangle it. </p> <p>Men then came forward and clubbed the beast senseless, but it took the strength of many people to hang it up and finally execute it. \"Everyone was astonished how big it was,\" said Selina. \"It was at least 8ft long.\" </p> <p>If it was a human victory, it was one tinged with great sadness. This man-eater was a Bengal Royal, one of the largest of all tiger species, but this was hardly the magnificent beast of the forest seen on TV nature programmes; it was huge, but it was also old, thin and mangey, and had clearly come to the village half-starving. </p> <p>\"It was responsible for about half a dozen other deaths in recent months. It became a man-eater and every now and then it entered villages to look for prey,\" said Rajesh Chakma, from the forestry department, who arrived later with colleagues and took away the body. </p> <p>The tiger attack and the village's revenge on the animal was not unexpected. The Sunderbans' maze of swamp, islands and mangrove forests lying between India and Bangladesh is one of the very few places left in the world where man is not top of the food chain. It is possibly the most dangerous place on earth. </p> <p>Whereas tiger populations are plunging around the world to the point where there may be only about 6,000 left, in the Sunderbans it is believed that numbers are at least stable. At least 500 are known to live there and this almost inaccessible watery wilderness is now the greatest stronghold of tigers left in the world. </p> <p>But in the past few years man and tiger have been confronting each other more and more in the Sunderbans, and for once, it seems that tigers are getting the upper hand. \"More people are being killed in the forest and more tigers are coming out of the forest into human communities than ever,\" says Mamun Rashid, author of a study of 180 human-tiger confrontations in Bangladesh. </p> <p>The Jalepara tiger was the first trapped and killed by a Bangladeshi community in more than four years, but it followed a pattern, says Rashid. \"If a tiger is found in a village the word spreads quickly. Often the tiger is kept cornered somewhere for a long time while people from the village and places nearby come to see the spectacle. Eventually the people try to kill it by stabbing it with spears, knives, axes and or by throwing rocks. Cornered and injured, the tiger often lashes out at someone.\"</p> <p>Officially, there are about 40 human deaths a year from tigers in the Bangladeshi Sunderbans but this is a major underestimation, he says. \"There is a definite increase in people being killed. On the Bangladeshi side of the Sunderbans, at least 70 people are being killed a year now.\" </p> <p>It is the same story in the smaller, Indian portion of the Sunderbans where there is a national park and an established tiger protection zone. \"In Indian Sunderbans last year there were officially 16 deaths by tigers but the actual number of deaths is certainly much more,\" says Pradip Shukla, director of the Sunderbans biosphere reserve. In the past few months there have been seven deaths, he says. \"Many killings go unrecorded; often villagers don't report attacks in restricted forest areas for fear of being fined or having their fishing permits cancelled.\"</p> <p>While tigers may be killing more, humans are largely responsible for their own deaths, according to Rashid. Up to 5,000 people now to go into the forest regularly for food, he says. \"What i s happening is that human poverty is increasing greatly in the Sunderbans. This is because fish catches are declining, the rivers are silting up and, because of climate change, there is an increased frequency and intensity of cyclones.\"</p> <p>Climate change is a reality in the Sunderbans. Rising sea levels, constant erosion and increasingly salty waters make life in the tangle of islands and mangrove forests harder for animals. Bangladeshi scientists record sea levels in the bay of Bengal rising three millimetres a year, resulting in less fresh water, more floods and erosion. One of the largest islands is predicted to shrink by 15% by 2020. On top of that, new irrigation and hydropower projects have reduced the flow of the Ganges. The net result is less space and prey for the tiger. </p> <p>\"The only way that communities can survive is by going deeper into the forests to collect resources, like honey, fish, shrimps and crabs, and wood for their boats and homes,\" says Rashid. </p> <p>\"They are more vulnerable than they used to be. People now rely far more on the forest for subsistence.</p> <p>\"In the past, people could cross the river and go into the forest without too much danger; now the tiger is attacking people more,\" says Selina. \"In the last five years, 10 people from Jelepara have died in tiger attacks. There are many tiger widows here. Ten years ago perhaps one tiger would cross the river a year. The animal would take a cow or a goat and that would be that. Now we have two or three visits a year.\"</p> <p>Tigers are being forced to come out of the forest more because they have less prey than before, says Rashid. His research suggests that most of the victims were attacked from behind and that nearly 80% died. It also put to rest theories that tigers always eat their victims. In just 7% of the attacks did they fully consume humans. Usually, it seems, they took just a few bites, or, as in Jelepara, just killed and left them.</p> <p>Theories abound as to why Sunderbans tigers are more aggressive than elsewhere. Some wildlife experts say the water in this coastal area is more salty and this puts them in a state of constant discomfort. Others speculate that the only way a tiger can defend its territory in these tidal areas is to physically dominate everything that enters. Another possibility is that these animals have grown used to human flesh due to the weather. Cyclones kill many people each year and human bodies drift into the swampy waters, where tigers scavenge them.</p> <p>Equally possible is that tigers in the remote, largely inaccessible Sunderbans were never subject to the hunting massacres that took place in colonial times on the subcontinent, and so have never developed a fear of humans.</p> <p>Today, the villagers' fears are well-founded. \"One man in Jelepara was so afraid of being killed by a tiger that he moved to India to find work. But he was sent back and had to go to the forest to subsist. He was killed immediately,\" says another man in the village.</p> <p>The hostility between the world's two top predators has been based on equal amounts of fear and respect. Fishermen and honey collectors say prayers and perform rituals to the forest gods before setting out on expeditions. In some areas, people going into the forest wear masks looking like faces on the back of their heads, in the belief that tigers always attack from behind. This is said to have worked for a short time, but it seems that the tigers quickly realised it was a hoax, and the attacks continued. On the Indian side of the Sunderbans, people going into the forests wear stiff pads on their backs to prevent the tigers biting the spine, one of their favourite ways to attack.</p> <p>\"If you want to stop the tiger killing people and want to protect the tiger, then you must reduce poverty in the region,\" says Rashid. \"If you reduce poverty you can increase biodiversity. Development is the best conservation here. Otherwise, the tiger will come again and again to the villages and will kill more people. And people will not stop going to the forest, so the deaths will continue\".</p> <h2>Heading for extinction? <br>The animals under greatest threat from a warming world </h2> <p>Animals and plants have evolved very slowly to live in specific environments, but climate change is happening very fast and leaving them unable to adapt. Those suited to cooler climates must move polewards or uphill when the climate becomes just that little bit warmer. That's easy enough for birds and fish; species that would normally only be found in the Mediterranean or further south are now turning up in British waters as the plankton and insects they feed on move north. But for large animals, which often have restricted space in reserves, the future looks uncertain. </p> <p><strong>Polar bears</strong><br>The polar bear could disappear in the wild unless the pace of global warming slows. It uses sea ice as a floating platform to catch prey, but this is melting at a rate of 9% a decade. Last week, arctic ice fell to its second lowest level ever.</p> <p><strong>Tigers</strong><br>Tigers are threatened by climate change, and not just in the Indian and Bangladeshi Sunderbans, where sea level rises and increased salinity is reducing habitat. In Sarawak, Nepal and elsewhere, the already critically endangered animals are finding fewer animals to prey on, as monsoon patterns change, and as people near their reserves compete more with them for food.</p> <p><strong>Elephants</strong><br>In Africa, elephants face a range of threats including shrinking living space, which brings them more frequently into conflict with people. With less space, they are not able to escape any changes to their natural habitat caused by global warming, including more frequent dry periods. </p> <p><strong>Frogs</strong><br>Frogs and other species depending on freshwater are being hit by a droughts in Australia and elsewhere. Since they rely on water to breed, any reduction or change in rainfall can reduce frog reproduction. In addition, higher temperatures dry out their breeding pools. </p> <p><strong>Orangutans </strong><br>Their last remaining strongholds in the Indonesian rainforests are threatened by oil palm plantations, but also by climate change increasing the duration and frequency of droughts. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Friday September 26 2008.

  "<p>On yesterday's <strong>Working Lunch</strong> (BBC2), resident consumer expert Gillian Lacey-Solymar briefly mixed up the cartoon-character names of America's recently nationalised mortgage companies, creating Freddie Mae and Fannie Mac. But the fact that even experts are having trouble telling their fannies from their freddies shows the need for a daily business programme: a Greg Dyke initiative that has long survived his brief director generalship.</p> <p>Bad times in global banking are the perfect time to test the premise. Spookily, the opening credits of Working Lunch take place in a sunken ship, which perhaps shows they knew what was coming. The series launched the career of Adrian Chiles, making him rich enough to need daily business advice himself, and subsequent presenters - Nik Wood is currently paired with Adam Shaw - aim for a similar jokey-blokey tone. </p> <p>Certain subjects inevitably recur. Required once again to give mortgage advice, the consumer guru apologised for reprising greatest hits: \"Anyone who watches the programme knows that my answer is always: shop around!\" </p> <p>But the biggest problem for specialist programmes (I speak from long experience in arts broadcasting) is that, for most of the time, you are dealing with material that interests very few people but, if there's ever a really big story, the mainstream programmes seize it for their headlines. So specialist journalism risks veering between accusations of irrelevance and overkill.</p> <p>Working Lunch perfectly illustrated this problem yesterday. The first two items - Warren Buffett buying up Lehman's and the FBI investigating Freddie and Fannie - had been leading secular bulletins all day. </p> <p>Another obstacle is the BBC's nervousness about commercial promotion. The camerawork in a sequence interviewing people at their workplaces kept manoeuvring to keep logos out of shot. But, within these limitations, Working Lunch entertainingly continues Dyke's mission to stop the BBC being so business-illiterate.</p>",
  "<p>Strong sales of food and fewer insurance claims for flood damage have helped drive half-year profits at the Co-operative Group to a record level.</p> <p>The Manchester-based group, which merged with United Co-operatives last year and recently agreed the \u00a31.6bn acquisition of supermarket rival Somerfield, made \u00a3198m in the six months to the end of July, up 60% on last year. Excluding the boost from the United Co-Ops merger, profits would have been up 20%.</p> <p>Food sales rose 43.5% to \u00a32.4bn with like-for-like sales up 5%, almost entirely the result of higher food prices. The wider market was up 4.6%.</p> <p>The group is refitting stores under its new green logo. More than 900 stores have been rebranded and 350, out of the 2,200-strong chain, have been refitted with another 350 due for a makeover in the second half. Refitted stores, said chief executive Peter Marks, are generating sales uplifts averaging 12%.</p> <p>The Somerfield deal, if given the go-ahead by the Office of Fair Trading, will add another 900 outlets, although the Co-op expects to be ordered to sell about 100 to rival operators.</p> <p>The food stores chain will then have 3,000 outlets, mostly convenience stores, with sales of some \u00a38bn - about half the size of Sainsbury's.</p> <p>Marks said the convenience sector was a good place to be in the current economic climate: \"Customers are aware of the price of fuel and are not getting in their cars to drive to supermarkets but are shopping more locally.\" He said the Co-op had seen little evidence of shoppers trading down to cheaper brands or migrating to discounters, but more than a third of the goods on the shelves are now on promotion.</p> <p>Profits from the group's pharmacies dipped \u00a33.8m to \u00a313.6m after the government cut prescription reimbursement charges while the travel business turned in a first-half profit of \u00a37.9m, after only breaking even in the same period last year. </p> <p>Funeral profits climbed 37% to \u00a324m after the merger, while financial services turned in \u00a381m, up \u00a358m on last year, largely due to fewer weather-related general insurance claims.</p> <p>Marks said the Co-op's ethical credentials may help attract new customers. \"We have had nothing in the news recently but greedy bankers and corporate greed. But we can provide something different.\"</p> <p>He forecast 18 months to two years of tough economic conditions, but said it would not be nearly as severe as the economic crisis of the 1970s.</p>",
  "<p>The UK government's own environmental watchdog has called for a halt to the construction of a new generation of coal-fired power stations unless they are built with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/05/carboncapturestorage.carbonemissions1\">carbon capture and storage</a> (CCS) technology installed from the outset.</p> <p>The comments, made as part of the Environment Agency's official response to the government's consultation on CCS, also urged faster progress in proving that the technology was commercially viable.</p> <p>\"Building a new generation of coal fired power stations without capturing the carbon emissions would lock the UK into using high carbon technology for decades to come,\" said Chris Smith, a former Labour cabinet minister and the newly-appointed chairman of the Environment Agency. </p> <p>\"This is not an environmentally sustainable way of generating power given the challenges we face with climate change.\"</p> <p>Earlier this year, the Environment Agency wrote to energy secretary John Hutton, warning that any coal plants built before CCS was available must not be allowed to \"undermine future carbon budgets and targets\". It added, \"This is likely to mean that the station is forced to fit CCS in the future or close.\"</p> <p><strong>Carbon capture</strong></p> <p>CCS is a range of technologies that can trap carbon dioxide from power stations and industrial sites, then transport and store them in geological formations deep underground. </p> <p>It has the potential to make a big impact in reducing global carbon emissions - at its best, CCS could prevent 90% of the CO2 emitted by power stations from getting into the atmosphere.</p> <p>The UK government launched a competition last year to fund a commercial-scale demonstration CCS project but this is unlikely to be built before 2013 at the earliest. </p> <p>Meanwhile, last month, the Swedish power company Vatenfall inaugurated the world's first demonstration project where CCS was attached to a power station - its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/05/carboncapturestorage.carbonemissions\">Schwarze Pumpe</a> power plant in north Germany will store 100,000 tonnes of CO2 per year.</p> <p>\"Although carbon capture and storage technology has been demonstrated on a small scale, there is now an urgent need for it to be demonstrated on a commercial scale,\" said Smith. </p> <p>\"Any new coal power station to be built should have a consent that requires that it helps demonstrate the technology. Such a consent should be strictly time limited and only renewed if carbon capture and storage is fully deployed.\"</p> <p><strong>'Clear rebuke'</strong></p> <p>Greenpeace climate campaigner Jim Footner said: \"This carefully timed intervention is a clear rebuke to business secretary John Hutton and his plans for a conventional, coal fired power station at Kingsnorth in Kent. </p> <p>\"As head of the environment agency, Lord Smith knows more than most about the devastating impacts that climate change could have on Britain's coastlines and vulnerable communities. </p> <p>\"By objecting to new coal projects unless they use carbon capture technology from the outset, he is simply aligning himself with the views of the world's top climate scientists.\" </p> <p>He added: \"Instead of going back to coal, we need a revolution in the renewables industry and a step change in our approach to energy efficiency.</p> <p>\"This country has the best renewable resources in Europe, now all we need is for Gordon Brown to step in and show some real leadership on this issue.\"</p> <p>In its submission to the government's CCS consultation, which closed for submissions on Monday, the Environment Agency added that merely being \"carbon capture ready\", where a plant is built ready to install CCS equipment after it begins operations, was not good enough.</p> <p>\"Coal-fired power stations will for a considerable time continue to be a significant part of global energy supply,\" said Smith. </p> <p>\"However, we need to ensure that they are part of a solution to the challenges of climate change, not a problem. </p> <p>\"This is only possible by ensuring carbon capture and storage is quickly proven in line with the prime minister's recent commitment to clean coal technology. A funding mechanism will be urgently needed to support this development.\"</p>",
  "<p>The green button was pressed on a nuclear revolution yesterday with a \u00a312.5bn takeover of British Energy, the UK's main atomic power company, by EDF of France.</p> <p>The deal, under which the mainly state-owned company committed itself to build four new power stations, was welcomed by Gordon Brown, who described it as \"crucial to the country's energy security\".</p> <p>However, it brought a wave of protest from anti-nuclear campaigners, rival power companies and consumer groups opposed to the deal on a mixture of environmental and competition grounds.</p> <p>EDF, one of the biggest names in the nuclear world, will control all British Energy's power stations, which currently produce around 18% of the country's electricity. EDF will construct two more reactors at Sizewell in Suffolk and two at Hinkley Point in Somerset - all pressurised water-style reactors similar to those EDF has built and operated in heavily nuclear-dependent France.</p> <p>The new stations, in addition to British Energy's eight nuclear plants, would be expected to begin producing electricity from 2017 onwards.</p> <p>EDF has promised to sell off unwanted land at other British Energy sites so that rival power companies can develop new reactors at Bradwell, Essex, and either Heysham, Lancashire, or Dungeness, Kent. It is also in talks to sell a 25% stake in the operation to Centrica, the parent group of British Gas. \"We are delighted that the British Energy board has unanimously accepted this offer,\" said the EDF chairman, Pierre Gadonneix. \"This paves the way for investment in the UK.\"</p> <p>The prime minister said the moves kick-started a drive to bring low-carbon energy to a country in need of energy security. \"New nuclear is becoming a reality. This deal is good value for the taxpayer and a significant step towards the construction of a new generation of nuclear stations to power the country,\" said Brown.</p> <p>Unions also welcomed the announcement and the prospect of jobs being created. Gary Smith, national officer of the GMB, which represents thousands of workers in the industry, said: \"At long last, one of the pieces is in place to secure an energy future for Britain. We look forward to having a constructive dialogue with EDF regarding the building of much-needed nuclear facilities on British Energy sites.\" </p> <p>However, there was opposition from environmentalists, who are largely opposed to nuclear power because of safety fears and its legacy of toxic waste.</p> <p>Nathan Argent, head of Greenpeace's nuclear campaign, said his organisation feared investment in renewables would now be squeezed out. \"Just yesterday Gordon Brown promised the UK a million green-collar jobs in the manufacturing sector, but his push for nuclear power has led to a deal which will benefit the French taxpayer and create French jobs.</p> <p>\"This country could become a world leader in renewable energy, which would bring a massive boost to the economy whilst tackling climate change and energy security. But EDF is determined to block this path because, as the company admits, growth in the renewables industry will kill off any hopes for more nuclear power.\" </p> <p>But Vincent de Rivaz, chief executive of EDF Energy in Britain, said the takeover would provide security of supply, take care of affordability and reduce carbon emissions.</p> <p>The company shrugged off rising delays and costs at a reactor being built in Finland, saying EDF could take advantage of experience learned from a new facility it was building in Normandy.</p> <p>The plan also came under fire for its potential impact on consumers and power prices. The merger with British Energy will raise EDF's share of the power-generating market from 6% to 25%, raising questions about its reach into British households. \"Our concerns are not about foreign ownership or the rights and wrongs of nuclear power, they are around putting more power into the hands of the big six energy groups,\" said Adam Scorer, campaigns director of energywatch. \"We think the current level of concentration has already led to prices being higher than necessary, and this situation has just got worse.\" </p> <p>The watchdog pointed out that Centrica - owner of British Gas - Scottish and Southern Energy are the only members of the big six which are quoted on the London stock market and therefore give detailed breakdowns of their financial arrangements. Npower and Powergen are owned by big continental utilities, RWE and E.ON, while Scottish Power is controlled by Iberdrola of Spain, leading to what energywatch said was a worrying lack of transparency.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Alex Lambie, the head of Welsh Power, has written to Malcolm Wickes, the energy minister, calling for the deal to be delayed until the completion of an investigation into the energy sector by the Competition Commission.</p>",
  "<p>Most of the news writing advice applies equally to features, although the intro and structure will be different. Feature is a broad term. Some news stories, even major front page stories, are written in the manner of a feature. This is usually called the narrative style. It is still story telling, but it is closer to the personal form of telling a child a story, building to a climax rather that giving it all away in the intro. </p> <p>It represents the slow burn rather than putting the main point of interest in the intro. It is higher risk, because the golden rule of gaining and keeping the reader's attention paragraph by paragraph must still apply. The parody of the narrative story makes the point: \"It was just another day for Sarah. Little did she know as she left the house that by the time she returned for tea her life would have changed for ever.\" Now read on; but few would. </p> <p>The structure and the writing must demand that the reader wants to know what happened next, turning the narrative story into the newspaper equivalent of a page-turner. Extraneous or tedious information will make the reader lose interest and give up before finding out what the story is all about. The narrative works if there is narrative drive, and this demands more of the writer. The style can provide more atmosphere, more emotion, more colour. It can paint a picture and take the reader to the scene of events. It is emphatically not a chronological news story with more adjectives and more superfluous information that bores the reader and adds nothing to the story.</p> <p>Features can be news backgrounders, fulfilling the explanatory role when there is not room for that in the main news story. Increasingly, newspapers run packages, where news and background features - explanation, implications, case studies - are placed together in the newspaper. Features can also be away from the news: talking points, social trends, fads, fashions, arts and entertainment. They can explain issues and add the human dimension to stories about statistics and medical conditions. They cover all the specialist areas, such as sport, education, environment, music, technology and travel. Features are not necessarily constrained by the journalistic obsessions with newness or exclusivity. They can deal with what is simply interesting, remarkable or amusing.</p> <p>Features must be planned. Structure is paramount, the organisation of material gathered, from facts to quotes, description to context. The danger is for features to ramble or digress and then peter out. Whereas news stories are designed to be cut from the bottom (built in obsolescence at the end of the piece), the feature must have an end, a climax or a pay-off. </p> <p>They will often have a prescribed length, which is both a luxury for the writer, and a challenge. No excuses if it doesn't flow. Nobody else to blame if vital facts are missing. The feature form allows for more expression by the writer because it is less formulaic than the traditional news story, but with that come pitfalls. </p> <p>Features are the value-added part of the paper; you can keep up with the news without reading them. So they must maintain interest and be written in such a way that the reader keeps reading. That means changes of pace, lack of waffle, keeping to the point and ensuring that there is a narrative drive from beginning to end.</p> <h2>Lynn Barber on interviewing celebrities</h2> <p>The main problem with interviewing celebrities today is that you are given so little time - one hour is considered generous. So any minute when the subject is not talking is a minute wasted. Questions should be short, clear, and specific rather than general. \"What book did you last read?\" is better than \"Do you like reading?\" because almost everyone will say they like reading, whereas if the last book they read was Heat magazine, you get a sharper idea of their reading habits. Never waste time asking for information that you could have found on Wikipedia. And do take a long list of questions, even if you don't stick it - you are bound to need it occasionally as a prompt.</p> <p>Always use a tape recorder, even if you also want to take notes, as libel insurance. That way, if the subject subsequently claims \"I didn't say that\", you have proof. And also, with a tape recording, you can reproduce their exact way of talking, not just the gist. </p> <p>Be polite, pleasant, punctual. Always look interested, never shocked or disapproving. Let the reader do the disapproving - your job is to elicit the quotes.</p> <p>There are various ways of presenting interviews but the one I prefer is the first person account that aims to answer the question, \"What was it like to meet so and so?\" This format does not pretend to any kind of omniscience, and for that reason I think it is the most honest.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Lynn Barber is an award-winning interviewer for the Observer</p> <h2>Peter Bradshaw on how to write a review</h2> <p>In writing a review, your watchwords should be: simplicity, clarity and lightness of touch. You should always bear in mind a reader who, though, broadly acquainted with the sort of thing you are writing about, cannot be assumed to know all that much. He or she must be brought up to speed as quickly and fairly as possible about the matter at hand. Then you can start weighing in with all your subjective and provocative value judgments. </p> <p>With film reviews, it is important to give some idea of the plot, but not to give too much away. Do this, and you are guilty of spoilerism. I have been an offender myself. One of the most difficult things is striking a balance between conveying the big picture about a film, and zooming in on the telling detail. You have to give what's happening on the screen your undivided attention and cultivate the art of remembering it. This means writing your review within a few hours of seeing the film.</p> <p>Cliches? A wise editor of mine threatened to fine me \u00a320 every time I used the word \"darkly\", rising to \u00a350 if it was bolted to the word \"funny\" or \"comic\". By all means try to write funny reviews, though as Kingsley Amis said of novels: they don't have to be funny, but they can't afford to be unfunny. </p> <p>Digression, riffing, going wildly off the point - it's all fine, as long as it's entertaining, and judging this comes with experience. You can annoy or enrage the readers as much as you like. Just don't bore them.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Peter Bradshaw is the Guardian's film critic</p>",
  "<h2>Research shows global drop in house prices</h2> <p>House prices are falling globally and there are signs that the situation is getting even worse, according to new research published yesterday. During the year to the end of June the cost of property fell in 21 of the 33 countries across the world for which there is reliable data, according to the property research group Global Property Guide. The group said the Baltic states, the US, the United Kingdom and Ireland were leading the decline. \"Only five countries out of 33, at this stage last year, had seen year-on-year declines in house prices in real terms.

  "<p>South Africa yesterday broke ranks with Australia and New Zealand by insisting that next year's Super 14 and Tri-Nations series be played under the experimental law variations being trialled in northern hemisphere for the next nine months. South Africa do not want the inclusion of contentious laws which have led to a welter of free-kicks this year.</p> <p>The stance is likely to kill off hopes of all 23 variations being adopted full-time when the International Rugby Board votes on them next May. Only 13 are being trialled in Europe with Australia, in particular, furious that European unions vetoed the experimental rules adopted in the south this year which downgraded most offences from a penalty to a free-kick and which awarded a free-kick against a side that took the ball into a ruck or a maul and failed to bring it out.</p> <p>The global variations will be used in the November internationals in Europe, the Six Nations and on the Lions tour to South Africa next year. \"It is vital that we have one set of laws if we are to prepare properly for the series against the Lions,\" said the president of the South African Rugby Football Union, Oregan Hoskins. \"We have had five sets of the variations apply in South Africa this season; it has been confusing to the public and even to the referees. One set of laws for all matches is the only way to go.\"</p> <p>The Australian Rugby Union chief executive, John O'Neill, three months ago warned the European unions that they were in danger of creating a split in the game between north and south by refusing to trial the free-kick ELVs, even threatening that the three SANZAR unions would consider pulling out of the World Cup, but the decision by South Africa, who finished bottom of the Tri-Nations having won the World Cup under the old laws, has left him with a puncture to repair.</p> <p>O'Neill has claimed that southern hemisphere rugby can use the sanctions of their choice until August 1 next year, but the reality is that if Australia and New Zealand want the Super 14 and Tri-Nations to be played with non-global variations, they will need dispensation from the IRB and they are highly unlikely to receive it. \"I trust we will be able to reach a consensus with our (SANZAR) partners when we meet next month,\" said Hoskins. \"If that is not possible then we may have to go to arbitration on the matter.\"</p> <p>Three British players are among the nominees for the International Rugby Board player of the year award. The Wales captain Ryan Jones and his compatriot Shane Williams feature on a five-strong list, alongside Scotland's scrum-half Mike Blair.

The winner will be announced on November 23.</p>",
  "<p>You've gathered the information, done the reporting. You've interviewed all the people involved, the eye witnesses to the explosion, the police, etc, etc. And now you have to write the story. You have pages in your notebook of facts, observations, quotes. You may have some agency copy, some material from other media. The first thing to do is stop and think. Do not start writing until you have a plan. Read through all your notes, marking the most important pieces of information and the quotes you want to use. The information you have gathered will not have entered your notebook in order of importance. You need to decide what is more important, what is less important, to establish a hierarchy of pieces of information. And this is where you must think about your audience. Not necessarily what interests you most, but what will interest them. It may not be the same thing, and this is where knowing, having a feeling for, understanding your audience is so important. As you stare at the blank screen try to imagine the reader.</p> <p>It depends on the publication you are writing for, of course. You can assume more knowledge if you are writing for a specialist publication, or a specialist section of a newspaper. A cricket report or commentary can assume knowledge of the rules of cricket; an article for a motoring magazine can assume the reader knows what a supercar is. But some specialist publications set out to educate - computer magazines are a good example - and while interest can be assumed, knowledge of how to use specific pieces of software cannot. So understand the intentions of the publication you write for, or if you are a freelance you seek to sell to. </p> <p>The market sector in which the newspaper is located is also relevant to how you write. You will find longer sentences and paragraphs and sometimes longer words in the more serious newspapers selling relatively small numbers of copies than in mass-selling newspapers with circulations 10 times as big. The reader of the Guardian will tend to be better educated and to have a larger vocabulary than the reader of the Sun. But do not, as a writer, show off your extensive vocabulary. It is never better, wherever you are writing, to prefer the less familiar word - \"wordy\" is always better than \"prolix\". Nobody is impressed by the use of a word they do not understand or would not use in everyday speech. The danger of talking down to the audience - assuming vocabulary as well as knowledge - is that it insults readers, makes them feel inadequate. And that turns them off and, worse, turns them away. They do not read on, and you have not communicated with them. The best writing for popular journalism is some of the best writing in journalism, and is hard to do. It is readily understandable, instantly readable and, if it is done well, makes you want to read on. Space is always the most precious commodity in a newspaper. Long words and sentences take up more space. Self-indulgent writing pleases nobody except perhaps the writer.</p> <p>Stephen King, who has sold more novels than most, reflected on his craft in On Writing, and drew a similar message: \"One of the really bad things you can do to your writing is to dress up the vocabulary, looking for long words because you're maybe a little bit ashamed of your short ones. This is like dressing up a household pet in evening clothes. The pet is embarrassed and the person who committed this act of premeditated cuteness should be even more embarrassed.\"</p> <p>So the overriding message in journalistic writing is: Keep It Simple. One of the greatest editors and journalists is Harold Evans, who has written one of the best books on journalistic writing, Essential English for Journalists, Editors and Writers. He summed it up thus: \"It is not enough to get the news. We must be able to put it across. Meaning must be unmistakable, and it must also be succinct. Readers have not the time and newspapers have not the space for elaborate reiteration. This imposes decisive requirements. In protecting the reader from incomprehension and boredom, the text editor has to insist on language which is specific, emphatic and concise. Every word must be understood by the ordinary reader, every sentence must be clear at one glance, and every story must say something about people. There must never be a doubt about its relevance to our daily life. There must be no abstractions.\"</p> <p>Below are a series of tips for keeping things simple and encouraging the reader to read it. They are addressed at news writing, but most apply to all forms of journalistic writing.</p> <p><strong>The intro </strong></p> <p>This is the start of the story, the opening paragraph. The traditional news introductory paragraph, still the dominant form, has two related purposes: to engage the reader instantly and to summarise what the story is all about. The structure is known as the \"inverted pyramid\" and dates back to the days of hot metal when words on their way on to paper passed through a stage of being slugs of lead. It was always easier and faster to cut a story from the bottom, using a pair of tweezers. News stories always have to be cut because reporters write them too long, and the (imperfect) theory was that a well structured story could always be cut from the bottom so that in extremis (do not use - see later) if the intro was the only paragraph left it still made sense. The good intro depends on your judgment and decisiveness. It declares why the story is being published, what is the newest, most interesting, most important, most significant, most attention-grabbing aspect of the story. It is not a summary of everything yet to come. The best intro will contain a maximum of two or three facts, maybe only one. In a popular tabloid it will consist of one sentence, probably no more than 25 words. The worst intro will be uncertain of what the story is all about and will contain several ideas. The best intro will demand that you read on. The worst will make it likely that you will move on.</p> <p>As Tony Harcup puts it in his Journalism, Principles and Practice: \"The intro is crucial because it sets the tone for what follows. A poorly written intro might confuse, mislead or simply bore the reader - a well-written intro will encourage the reader to stay with you on the strength of the information and angle you have started with.\"</p> <p><strong>Rest of the story</strong></p> <p>Once you've got the intro right, the second paragraph will be the most important you write. And so on. Holding the reader's interest does not stop until he or she has read to the end. You have already planned your structure, the hierarchy of information. After the intro you are amplifying the story, adding new, if subordinate, information, providing detail, explanation and quotes. And doing all this so that the story reads smoothly and seamlessly. News stories are about providing information, and there is nothing more frustrating for the reader than finishing a story with unanswered questions still hanging. Journalism students are taught about the five Ws: who, what, when, where and why. They are a useful tool to check you have covered all the bases, though not all will always apply. It is always difficult to detach yourself from your own prose when you read it through, but try. Try to put yourself in the place of the reader coming cold to the story, interested in it and asking the questions that will make it clear. Have you dealt with them? The subeditor, or text editor, will soon tell you if you haven't. There is always a problem over how much knowledge to assume, particularly with a running story of which today's is another episode. You cannot always start from the beginning for the benefit of reader recently arrived from Mars, but you can include sufficient to ensure it is not meaningless. It is a matter of judgement. </p> <p><strong>Active not passive</strong></p> <p>Always prefer the active tense in news writing, and particularly in intros. The active tense is faster and more immediate; it also uses fewer words. \"Arsenal were beaten by Manchester United last night ... \" is slower than \"Manchester United beat Arsenal ... \", and if it is a London newspaper \"Arsenal lost to Manchester United ... \" is still preferable. </p> <p><strong>Positive even if it is negative </strong></p> <p>Not: \"The government has decided not to introduce the planned tax increase on petrol and diesel this autumn.\" But: \"The government has abandoned plans to raise fuel taxes this autumn.\" News is more engaging if it describes something that is happening, rather than something that is not.</p> <p><strong>Quotes</strong></p> <p>Long quotes bring a story grinding to a halt, particularly if they are from politicians, particularly local politicians, bureaucrats or bores. Short, incisive, direct quotes change the pace of a story, add colour and character, illustrate bald facts, and introduce personal experience. Journalists paraphrase speeches and reports to focus on the main points, and to make them shorter and more comprehensible. It is a vital skill, as is using indirect quotation. But a quote will add a different tone of voice, inject emotion or passion, answer the question \"what was it like?\", \"how did you feel?\", \"what are you going to do next?\", \"what actually happened.\" Usually the reporter was not there and is gathering the information after the event. The direct quote provides actuality. And sometimes the quote has to be there to provide the precision, when the actual words used are crucial, and sometimes the story itself.</p> <p>Never use a word other than \"said\" when attributing a quote. Affirmed, opined, exclaimed, interjected, asserted, declared, are all tacky synonyms which do nothing to help the flow of the story. When people speak they \"say\". On rare occasions it might be relevant to the story if they shout or scream; in which case break the rule.</p> <p><strong>Officialese</strong></p> <p>Language used in letters from bank managers, council officers, utilities and read from their notebooks by police officers giving evidence in court should always be avoided. People do not \"proceed\"; they walk. Police do not \"apprehend\"; they stop or arrest or detain. \"At this point in time\" is now. </p> <p>George Orwell, in his essay Politics and the English Language, converts a passage from Ecclesiastes and turns it into officialese to make the point. Original: \"I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, not the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.\" Orwell's rewrite: \"Objective consideration of contemporary phenomena compels the conclusion that success or failure in competitive activities exhibits no tendency to be commensurate with innate capacity, but that a considerable element of the unpredictable must invariably be taken into account.\"</p> <p><strong>Adjectives</strong></p> <p>Keith Waterhouse, the veteran Daily Mail and Daily Mirror columnist wrote an irresistible book on journalistic writing called Newspaper Style. It was in fact an adaptation of the Mirror style book he had been commissioned to write. In it he warns of the dangers of adjectives thus: \"Adjectives should not be allowed in newspapers unless they have something to say. An adjective should not raise questions in the reader's mind, it should answer them. Angry informs. Tall invites the question, how tall? The well-worn phrase: his expensive tastes ran to fast cars simply whets the appetite for examples of the expensive tastes and the makes and engine capacity of the fast cars.\"</p> <p>This test should be applied to all adjectives used in journalistic writing. If they add relevantly to the information being provided, they can stay. If not, strike them. Too many writers believe adjectives add colour and style. Vague or general ones add nothing. \"Use specific words (red and blue),\" says Waterhouse, \"not general ones (brightly coloured).\"</p> <p><strong>Jargon, abbreviations, acronyms and know-all foreign phrases</strong></p> <p>All of us who work in organisations, professions, specific industries or bureaucracies are surrounded by jargon. We may regard it as shorthand to speed communication because we share the understanding of what it means, but, whether intentional or not, it is a protective shield that excludes those not in the know. That is the effect it has when used in newspaper writing. Those in the know understand; the rest do not. Anything readers do not understand makes them feel left out rather than included and turns them against the story. They may well stop reading. Medical, scientific and economic terms are a case in point. Avoid them or explain them. Price/earnings ratios and capitalisation mean nothing to the general reader. It is the same with abbreviations and acronyms. Today's students have no idea what CBI stands for; they are more likely to know FoI. A few could expand Nato, fewer the TUC. Many of the terms, although still in use, are generational. They need to be spelt out or explained, or another reader is lost. Just as long words speak down to those with a smaller vocabulary - and there is always a simpler, and less space consuming, alternative - so well-used Latin expressions mean nothing to those who have not learned that language, apart from lawyers who have had to mug up. Pro bono, inter alia and in extremis have no place in newspapers, and usually mean the writer is showing off.</p> <p><strong>Puns and cliches</strong></p> <p>Headline writers love puns and phrases from 60s pop lyrics and editors frequently have to restrain their use. They sit even less easily in copy, where only readers over 55 can identify. Again, the danger is excluding readers. Worst of all is the extended metaphor or pun. Like this (real) one: \"Kingsbridge Silver Band has hit a high note with National Lottery chiefs to the tune of nearly \u00a352,000. Tired old instruments struck a chord with the lottery board, which has drummed up enough cash for a complete new set, giving the band plenty to trumpet about.\" Yes, really.</p> <p><strong>Apostrophes</strong></p> <p>The printed word has done more to save the apostrophe than the whole of the teaching profession. Given the pace of newspaper and magazine production it is extraordinary that so few errors in spelling or punctuation appear, a tribute to the subeditors who prepare copy for publication. From advertising (shockingly, sometimes intentionally) to the greengrocer's board we are bombarded with mis- (and missing) punctuation, yet it is invariably correct in print, though seldom when it emerges from the home printer. If in doubt, and most people are, consult Lynne Truss (Eats, Shoots and Leaves). Often.</p> <h2>Exercise: acronyms</h2> <p>What do the following acronyms stand for? If you don't know instantly, then you can be sure there will be plenty of readers who don't. So do not use them without explanation.</p> <p>Defra, Asbo, OECD, SEO; CBI; ISA; Fifa; PCT; Sats; FTSE</p> <p><strong>Answers:</strong></p> <p>Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs; Anti-Social Behaviour Order; Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development; Search Engine Optimisation; Confederation of British Industry; Individual Savings Account; F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association; Primary Care Trust; Standard Assessment Tests; Financial Times Stock Exchange (used to describe stock market indices such as FTSE 100).</p> <h2>Exercise: plain English</h2> <p>Rewrite the following two paragraphs in plain English suitable for publication in a newspaper or magazine. Remove unnecessary words, passive verbs, repetition, cliche, jargon and pompous or pretentious expression. Jot down some questions the story fails to answer.</p> <p>\"Joseph Foster and his sibling Kate were advancing cheerfully along Wesley Street when they were in minor collision with an HGV which unexpectedly mounted the pavement. It transpired later, when the multi-coloured Volvo truck driver who was transporting a container containing motor parts to Oxford was being interviewed by a local radio reporter, that the lorry veered to avoid a police car speeding towards him on the wrong side of the road. The spokesman at police headquarters told a different story. </p> <p>\"But it was the children's lucky day as they escaped shocked but unscathed. A hospital spokesman at nearby Eddington hospital, run by the Barton NHS Foundation Trust, said the two children were lucky not to have been seriously injured.

  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337944908\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1815618897_gdn-nat-080924-sf-waves-02-VFa-4x3.flv\"/> </video>   <p>From a distance, they look like nothing more than thin red lines on the horizon, easily lost amid the tumbling blue of the Atlantic Ocean. But get closer and the significance of the 140m-long tubes - 10 years in the making by a British company and now floating in the sea off the coast of Portugal - becomes apparent: they are the beginning of an entirely new industry in the hunt for clean power. </p> <p>This week the red snake-like devices were inaugurated as part of the world's first commercial-scale wave power station, three miles from the coast of the northern Portuguese town of Agu\u00e7adoura. The project, which will generate clean electricity for more than 1,000 family homes in its first phase, marks the latest step in Portugal's moves to become a leader in developing renewable energy sources, using technology developed in Britain.</p> <p>At the heart of the Agu\u00e7adoura power station are three cylindrical wave-energy converters, designed and built by the Edinburgh-based company Pelamis Wave Power. Moving up and down on the endless waves of the open sea, they convert motion into electricity, without emitting any of the carbon dioxide that is warming the planet. </p> <p>\"The future of wave energy starts today,\" said Manuel Pinho, Portugal's minister of economy and innovation. \"Finland is very good in mobile phones; Portugal wants to be good in renewable energy. We are among the top five in the world, and we are just in the beginning of the process. </p> <p>\"Renewable energy is the source of energy for the future and we think this can create an industrial revolution and a lot of opportunities for jobs and research,\" he said, \"and we want to be ahead of the curve.\"</p> <p>Doug Parr, Greenpeace UK's chief scientist, said the British government's energy secretary, John Hutton, should take urgent note of the developments in Portugal. \"Wave technology invented in Scotland is powering Portuguese homes and making money for Portuguese suppliers, because our government has consistently neglected the renewables industry here in the UK.\" </p> <p><strong>Predictable</strong></p> <p>At peak output, the Pelamis wave machines near Agu\u00e7adoura will generate 2.25 megawatts, enough for the annual needs of about 1,500 family homes. Eventually, the station will be expanded with a further 25 Pelamis machines so it can generate up to 21MW of power. That will save 60,000 tonnes of CO2 a year compared with a fossil fuel plant. If you compare it to wind energy, wave is more predictable and is more sustained, typically,\" said Ian Sharp of Babcock &amp; Brown, which commissioned and built the Agu\u00e7adoura wave farm. </p> <p>Each of the semi-submerged Pelamis devices is 142m long, has a diameter of 3.5m and is made from 700 tonnes of carbon steel. A single wave converter is composed of four articulated sections that move up and down as the waves pass along it. At each of the hinges between the sections, hydraulic rams use the wave motion to drive generators to produce up to 750KW of power at peak output. The electricity generated by the three Pelamis devices will be carried by undersea cable to a substation in Agu\u00e7adoura, which will then feed the power into the Portuguese national grid. </p> <p>The Portuguese are also investing heavily in other renewable technologies. They are already spending \u00a3250m on more than 2,500 solar photovoltaic panels to build the world's largest solar farm near the small town of Moura in eastern Portugal. It will have twice the collecting area of London's Hyde Park and supply 45MW of electricity each year, enough to power 30,000 homes.</p> <p>In the past three years, Portugal has also trebled its hydroelectric capacity and quadrupled its wind power sources - northern Portugal has the world's biggest wind farm, with more than 130 turbines and a factory that builds the 40-metre-long blades.</p> <p>Pinho wants the country to rival Denmark or Japan in its commitment to developing renewables industries and predicts his country will generate 31% of all its primary energy from clean sources by 2020, compared with Britain's target of 15%. The Portuguese target means increasing the generation of electricity from renewable sources from 42% in 2005 to 60% in 2020. </p> <p>The \u20ac9m (\u00a37m) first phase of the Agu\u00e7adoura project, which involves the energy firms Enersis and Energias de Portugal, has been helped partly by the Portuguese government agreeing to guarantee a premium for the electricity the station will generate via a feed-in tariff of 25 cents per kWh. The project has also been given a \u20ac1.25m grant from the Portuguese Ag\u00eancia de Inova\u00e7\u00e3o.</p> <p>\"The Portuguese government has moved forward on wave energy more quickly than has happened in the UK,\" said Sharp. \"[In Portugal] we have a feed-in tariff arrangement so we had a guaranteed price for the power that was produced and you don't have that in the UK. The environment here was better to stimulate development.\"</p> <p><strong>Danger</strong></p> <p>In Britain, Pelamis is also involved in the South West Regional Development Agency's project to build a wave-power station off the north coast of Cornwall, called Wave Hub. This will be the country's first offshore facility for demonstrating a commercial-scale wave-power plant - but it is not expected to be operational until at least 2010. The South-West RDA estimates the project could create 1,800 jobs and inject \u00a3560m into the British economy.</p> <p>Parr warned that there could be dire consequences for the UK unless the government got its act together in developing renewable industries: \"There is a danger that jobs, investment and clean energy will go overseas because of Hutton's obsession with old technologies like coal and nuclear power. It's time we stopped the rot before our performance on renewables becomes a national disgrace.\"</p> <p>Friends of the Earth's renewable energy campaigner, Nick Rau, said that wave and tidal power could play a significant role in tackling climate change and reducing the UK's dependency on fossil fuels. \"The potential for this technology in the UK is enormous but the government is not doing enough to develop it.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Thursday September 25. Manuel Pinho predicts his country will generate 31% of all its primary energy from clean sources by 2020, not of all its power as we said. The Portuguese target means increasing the generation of electricity from renewable sources from 42% in 2005 (not 20%) to 60% in 2020. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown will today launch a global plan to recruit a million doctors, nurses and midwives in poor countries as an emergency session of the UN in New York seeks to make up lost ground in the effort to reach its millennium development goals.</p> <p>Despite fears that the deepening global financial crisis will deflect the west from the fight against poverty, the prime minister will call for rich countries to stick by their aid pledges and will announce an international taskforce aimed at mobilising money to tackle maternal mortality.</p> <p>The prime minister, who will co-chair the taskforce with the president of the World Bank, Robert Zoellick, said last night: \"It is unacceptable that one woman dies every minute in childbirth. Almost all these deaths are preventable. We urgently need to mobilise the resources to recruit the nurses, midwives and doctors to stop this tragedy.\"</p> <p>After pressure from Britain, the UN agreed to set aside today for a session designed to speed up progress in achieving the eight millennium goals, including universal primary education, a two-thirds decline in infant mortality, and a 50% drop in the numbers of people living below the dollar-a-day poverty line. </p> <p>The goals are supposed to be achieved by 2015. But on present trends, the UN may fail to meet any of its targets. Least progress has been made in achieving a 75% cut in the number of women dying in pregnancy or childbirth, from the current level of more than 500,000 deaths a year.</p> <p>The taskforce will report to next year's G8 summit in Italy with proposals on how to raise funds to employ more health workers. These plans will include Brown's international finance facility, a means of front-loading through sales of government bonds, and ideas floated by European governments such as an airline tax and levy on international currency transactions.</p> <p>Today's meeting will also see Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, pledge extra money to a $3bn (\u00a31.62bn) fund for the eradication of malaria. The UN will say the extra cash should make it possible to prevent any deaths from malaria by 2015.</p> <p>For education, there will be $3bn pledged to help 10 million children attend school, and Downing Street sources said there was likely to be a commitment from Fifa, the world governing body of football, to make primary school enrolment for sub-Saharan Africa one of the legacies of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.</p> <p>Kevin Watkins, director of the global monitoring report at Unesco, said there was an urgent need for education spending. \"This is one of those areas where the window of opportunity for success on the millennium goals is closing fast, because universal education by 2015 means getting everyone in school by about 2010 - and schools have to be built and teachers trained. </p> <p>\"There are now 75 million out of school, and our projections show we are unlikely to get much beyond halving this figure by 2015. We also estimate that around 3.6 million new teachers will have to be recruited in sub-Saharan Africa alone.\"</p> <p>Brown flew from his successful party conference in Manchester direct to New York for the UN general assembly meeting, which was convened especially to discuss how to put more money into the stalling anti-poverty drive. </p> <p>The prime minister told the Guardian: \"There are 100 million people facing famine, 17 million kids don't go to school, 10 million children die unnecessarily from diseases we could cure and, tragically, half a million women are dying avoidably in childbirth every year.\" </p> <p>Despite the global downturn, governments in the west could not afford to cut back on their development aid budgets. \"What we are saying,\" Brown added, \"is everyone has a contribution to make to reaching the millennium development goals, but at the moment people will say 'we've got a global economic problem, we should cut aid'. But with global food prices going up, we've got to increase food production in Africa if we are going to solve the problem.\"</p> <p>The shadow international development secretary, Andrew Mitchell, said: \"We've had enough global jamborees and talking. The clock is ticking and we're miles off track to achieving these goals. Governments around the world must get their act together - a real focus on outputs, not inputs, fewer, better coordinated aid agencies, rigorous independent aid evaluation, and a renewed emphasis on the very poorest countries and the poorest people. What we need to see in New York this week is less hot air and more action.\" </p> <p>Brown was due to meet the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, last night, and hold a breakfast meeting with fund managers before making a speech on the financial crisis tomorrow, which will stress the need for greater transparency by banks.</p>",
  "<p>Britain attracted the most foreign direct investment (FDI) in Europe in 2007, the United Nations said yesterday, but the financial turmoil in the global markets will have a detrimental effect on investment next year.</p> <p>In its annual World Investment Report, the UN Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) said that the UK was the number one destination for inward investment in Europe in 2007, attracting more than $1tn (\u00a3540bn). Globally, the UK was second only to the US.</p> <p>The UK stock of FDI rose to a record $1,347bn last year, up from $1,133bn in 2006. The US attracted $1,789bn. </p> <p>The increase of $223bn FDI flowing into the UK was bigger than 2006's rise of $148bn. Much of this was due to mergers and acquisitions activity in the middle of the year. </p> <p>Digby Jones, UK trade and investment minister, said: \"These are excellent figures. Once again, the UK has been ranked as the most successful destination for inward investment anywhere in Europe. 2007 was a record year, and we broke the trillion dollar threshold for the second time in a row.\"</p> <p>However, the report said that in light of the financial turmoil over the past two weeks the forecast for the next two years may have to be revised.</p> <p>Unctad spokesman Torbj\u00f6rn Fredriksson said that the credit crunch would have little immediate effect on investment as \"you don't change your investment plans overnight\". \"The UK might see a downturn in 2008 but we won't see a big impact until 2009.\" </p> <p>Lord Jones said: \"This year, the expectation is that the worldwide slowdown, including the twin global shocks of the credit crunch and rising energy and food prices, will make it more difficult for every economy to attract investment.\"</p> <p>Unctad said that global FDI flows will fall 10% at the end of this year from their 2007 record as major companies scale back spending plans.</p> <p>Despite the onset of the global financial crisis half way through the year, FDI flows rose 30% to $1.83tn in 2007, surpassing the previous peak in 2000 by some $400bn and topping the agency's preliminary estimate for 2007 of $1.5tn. </p> <p>But the report said the investment flows were falling this year, largely because of a sharp drop in merger and acquisition activity, the main driver of FDI.</p> <p>\"FDI flows to developing countries as a group are likely to remain quite stable. The main drop will be found in the area of mergers and acquisitions,\" said Supachai Panitchpakdi, secretary-general of Unctad.</p> <p>The report added that businesses were sensitive to the risk of further deterioration of the global economic situation. </p> <p>Half of those questioned said the possibility of a global downturn was a significant additional threat to their investment plans and 39% said financial instability had already had a significant negative impact on their intended spending over the next three years.</p>",
  "<p>Far from destroying jobs, tackling climate change will boost employment, claims a major new report published today by the UN and the international labour movement.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.unep.org/Documents.Multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=545&amp;ArticleID=5929&amp;l=\" en\" \">Green Jobs</a> study goes even further than the British government's Stern report in 2006, which urged countries to invest money in reducing emissions and adapting to climate change to avoid much greater costs later.</p> <p>The latest report has been hailed as crucial to overcoming global resistance from the labour movement, which for many years opposed the Kyoto agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions amid fears that members would lose their jobs.</p> <p>\"That was not something I'm particularly proud of,\" said Guy Ryder, general secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC), who said the movement had since accepted the United Nations-recommended emissions cut of 80% by 2050.</p> <p>\"This is a major turnaround,\" said Ryder. \"It's not perhaps because we have become wiser, it's because we have managed to integrate the notion of action against climate change with the green job agenda. And what this report shows is it's perfectly possible to reconcile those two interests in a way that doesn't threaten worker interests but actually promotes them in the long term. The biggest threat to the jobs and livelihoods of our members in future is to do nothing.\"</p> <p>However Achim Steiner, executive director of the UN environment programme (UNEP), called on governments to do more to support the emerging industries - comparing the need for intervention to that offered by the US and other governments to rescue failing financial institutions. (<a href=\"http://webcast.un.org/ramgen/ondemand/pressconference/2008/pc080924am1.rm\">Watch the press conference here</a>.)</p> <p>\"Imagine for a moment if some of those stimulus packages could be targeted towards not maintaining and sustaining the old economy of the 20th century but investing in the new economy of the 21st century,\" said Steiner. \"Millions of jobs, millions of enterprises and above all millions of opportunities for new entrants in the global economy.\"</p> <p>The ITUC, the International Labour Office (ILO), the International Organisation of Empoyers, and UNEP commissioned the Worldwatch Institute and Cornell University to conduct a study into how many jobs would be created in the \"green economy\".</p> <p>The report focused on the key areas considered to have the most potential to make improvements: energy supply, energy efficiency, transport, \"basic\" industries (such as iron and steel, aluminium, cement, paper and pulp), along with recycling, agriculture and forestry.</p> <p>The report said \"millions\" of new jobs would be created, based on other studies forecasting that the global market for environmental services and products would double by 2020, and reports that \"clean technology\" was booming.</p> <p>\"New jobs will be created, others will be adapted, and some will fade out,\" said Juan Somavia, the ILO director general.</p> <p>Jobs would be lost in some fossil fuel-intensive industries like steel and cement, but more jobs would be created than lost in switching from fossil fuel to renewable energy generation and from mass car use to more public transport, said Stephen Pursey, the ILO policy director.</p> <p>The report did not estimate a total figure because all jobs would have to become \"greener\", but \"on current performance it looks like there will be more opportunities than losses,\" said Pursey.</p> <p>Critics have warned that more labour-intensive \"green\" industries could be a less efficient way of producing goods and services than those they replaced. But such measures of wealth did not take account of the harm caused by pollution and other impacts such as climate change, said Pursey. \"Can we shift to a way of capturing more accurately the things we aspire to, [such as] cleaner, less polluted cities to live in,\" he added.</p> <p>The most important condition for benefiting from the green economy was clear public policies and incentives, said the report, which cited the examples of government support for energy efficiency in Germany and a scheme to install 1m solar panels in rural villages in Bangladesh, supported by the not-for-profit organisation Grameen Bank.</p> <p>However the report also called for better working conditions for people in some sectors of the green economy, such as waste disposal and recycling.<br>To help the poorest countries and most vulnerable workers benefit, governments needed to diversify economies, ensure social protection and train workers for new skills, said Somavia.</p> <p>\"Building a low carbon economy is not only about technologies or finances, it's about peoples and societies, it's about a cultural change to greater environmental consciousness and opportunities for decent work, so essentially it's about leadership \u2013 in government, in business, in trade unions, in local authorities, in international organisations, in NGOs [non governmental organisations], but particularly in the political world,\" said Somavia.</p>",
  "<p><strong>I am 31 and, 18 months ago, I separated from my husband. I met him when I was 19 and we have two children, both under the age of 10.

He's getting all the fun of a relationship without any of the responsibility that a loving marriage involves. The other man you like, being married, is likely to treat you in a similar way. </p> <p>Secretive, no-strings sex - is that all you're good for? Don't be a doormat for these men: you're worth more than that. Stop sleeping with the husband you've separated from, build up your self-confidence and concentrate on your children. Respect yourself and others will respect you too.<br><strong>CS</strong>, Crewe</p> <p><strong>Work out something with him</strong></p> <p>Lust can often inspire us to do things that are unwise for us psychologically, but equally, cold logic alone can't be the basis for a loving partnership.

Many relationships flounder because partners are no longer attracted to one another, but this is clearly not the case with the two of you. </p> <p>You have not taken legal steps to end your marriage yet, so you really need to have a frank discussion with your husband about the aspirations you have for your own futures, and those of your children.

Don't insist on a divorce if there's a chance of saving your marriage.</p> <p>As for the married man at work, he is just a diversion.

They may already be secretly pinning their hopes on their mother and father getting back together, so you really need to be very careful about this, particularly if you are adamant that this is not going to happen.</p> <p>You obviously recognise how important it is to provide a stable upbringing for your children, as you felt so strongly about your husband's lack of commitment to their welfare that you separated from him.

But before you make any big decisions, you need to step back from the current situation and look at what's happening a bit more objectively. You say you've known your husband for more than 12 years, and that you still enjoy a satisfying sexual relationship. A sexual attraction that's continued for such a long time must be very powerful, and it will have created an emotional bond between the two of you.</p> <p>Since you separated, it sounds as if the only other person to whom you've felt attracted is someone who's technically unavailable because he is committed to someone else. Could it be that part of the attraction you feel is that the chance of developing a lasting relationship is minimal? When we're not sure that we really want to change things, we'll often (unconsciously) put a stumbling block in the way. It may be that your attraction to your colleague shows you're doing just that - that is, you have chosen someone who's unable to have a meaningful relationship with you in the foreseeable future.</p> <p>You say you separated from your husband largely because of his lack of commitment to your children. However, doesn't that seem an unhelpful response to that particular problem? How does it address deficiencies in his dedication to your children to dissolve the marriage, so that he moves away from them? Doesn't that make it even harder for him to commit himself to them? Surely, if you'd like him to be more involved, you'll want to make it easier rather than harder for him to interact with the children?</p> <p>You speak of an \"emotional chasm\" between the two of you. What do you mean? If you enjoy sex together and have done so for years, it's unlikely that there's no positive emotional connection between you. It may be that you're confusing the disagreement you have about your respective roles as parents with how you feel about one another as partners.</p> <p>I don't know how long it was after you met before you had children, but I'd guess it wasn't long. It's quite possible that you've simply never had the opportunity to get to know each other as partners and friends, because you became parents so soon after you met.</p> <p>A good marriage consists of sexual, emotional and, in many cases, parental components. You already have a good sexual relationship. I don't think you've ever taken the time, or had many opportunities, to develop the emotional relationship, so you don't know how good it could be. Your partnership as parents should be worked through whether or not you separate. So isn't it worth working on your marriage for a bit longer?</p> <p>Try to ignore the pressure to get a divorce and start dating again, because it sounds as if you have unfinished work to do with your husband first. Ask him if he'd be willing to talk to a Relate counsellor with you (<a href=\"http://www.relate.org.uk\">relate.org.uk</a>, 0300 100 1234) or to see someone your GP recommends. If you can work things out, then you needn't contemplate divorce. If you can't, then at least you'll know you've tried hard. At that point, you'd also probably be ready to stop having sex with him, and perhaps even to contemplate a new relationship with someone else.</p> <h2>Next week: I'm gay and love a straight colleague</h2> <p>I've been in love with a friend of mine for two years now. Coming into a new work environment, I felt alienated and lonely until he reached out and made a real effort to include me in his social circle. However, my behaviour towards him was unforgivably lukewarm; I ended up socialising with another group of friends whose relationships with one another seem to be borne out of convenience rather than genuine affection.</p> <p>Despite this, my colleague at work continued to spend time with me, and it was then that I realised my feelings for him go beyond friendship. However, frustratingly, his popularity means that I can never spend enough time with him. I have remained in the closet for years, and have never acknowledged my sexual orientation before, so I feel completely clueless in this situation.</p> <p>Though others have jested about our \"relationship\", he doesn't seem to notice the office gossip. We have continued to be friends. He has recently decided to move away, and although we will still see each other socially it won't be the same when's he's not around. He's straight, so I know nothing could ever happen between us, but the painful prospect of losing him means I am now seriously considering telling him the truth, if only to save our friendship and make the time we spend together less uncomfortable for me. Do I owe him this, or would keeping quiet prevent me causing irreparable damage?</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 Private Lives </strong>appears every Thursday.

  "<p>As the two men who would succeed him train like Olympic athletes for tomorrow's foreign policy debate, pause for a moment to complete your final report on the 43rd president of the United States. What would you say?</p> <p>I would sum up his two terms in four words: hubris followed by nemesis.</p> <p>Remember the mood music of eight years ago. The greatest power the world has ever seen. Rome on steroids. An international system said to be unipolar, and Washington's unabashed embrace of unilateralism. The US as \"Prometheus unbound\", according to the neoconservative commentator Charles Krauthammer. Wall Street investment bankers bestriding the financial globe as Pentagon generals did the military globe and Harvard professors the soft power one. Masters of the universe. Personifying that hubristic moment: George Walker Bush.</p> <p>And now: nemesis. The irony of the Bush years is that a man who came into office committed to both celebrating and reinforcing sovereign, unbridled national power has presided over the weakening of that power in all three dimensions: military, economic and soft. \"I am not convinced we are winning it in Afghanistan,\" Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a congressional committee earlier this month. Many on the ground say that's an understatement. The massive, culpable distraction of Iraq, Bush's war of choice, leaves the US - and with it the rest of the west - on the verge of losing the war of necessity. Here, resurgent in Afghanistan and Pakistan, are the jihadist enemies who attacked the US on September 11 2001. By misusing military power, Bush has weakened it.</p> <p>Economically, the Bush presidency ends with a financial meltdown on a scale not seen for 70 years. The proud conservative deregulators (John McCain long among them) now oversee a partial nationalisation of the American economy that would make even a French socialist blush. A government bailout that will total close to a trillion dollars, plus the cumulative cost of the Iraq war, will push the national debt to more than $11 trillion. The flagships of Wall Street either go bust or have to be salvaged, with the help of government or foreign money. Most ordinary Americans feel poorer and less secure.</p> <p>The decline in soft power - the power to attract - is also dramatic. The Pew Global Attitudes Survey has recorded a precipitous worldwide fall in favourable views of the US since 2001. The map is chequered, of course, but the distaste extends beyond policies of the Bush administration to things such as \"American ways of doing business\", and \"American ideas about democracy\". Iraq has been central to this collapse of credibility and attractiveness. When Bush denounces Russia for invading a sovereign country (Georgia), as he did again at the UN on Tuesday, a cry of \"humbug\" goes up around the world. Now American-style free market capitalism is taking a further hit, while some of the alternative models are looking better.</p> <p>Last weekend, five former US secretaries of state - two Democrat, three Republican - gathered for a panel discussion on the future of foreign policy, televised by CNN. Asked by Christiane Amanpour what should be the biggest concern for the new president, Colin Powell replied: \"To restore a sense of confidence in the United States of America.\" Madeleine Albright added that the world of 2009 would be full of issues \"that can only be solved in cooperation with other countries\". And, Republican and Democrat, they chorussed \"close Guant\u00e1namo\".</p> <p>Even George Bush now seems to concur with this criticism of George Bush - and I don't just mean speculation that the father is privately critical of the son. Eight years ago, president Bush the younger hardly seemed to know what the word \"multilateral\" meant. In the course of his farewell address to the UN general assembly this week, he used the word \"multilateral\" 10 times.</p> <p>Obviously not all this mess can be blamed on Bush: he's not responsible for the epochal rise of China, nor for jihadist terrorists' long-term hatred of the west.</p> <p>But a great deal of it can. At the Truman Library in Independence, Missouri, you can still see the painted glass sign that president Harry Truman placed on his desk in the oval office: The Buck Stops Here. (On the back it says: I'm From Missouri.) The buck stops there. The contrast between the president from Missouri and the president from Texas is painful. Judgment, prudence, vision, patience, honesty - every quality that the 33rd president so signally possessed, as the US remade the world after 1945, has been signally lacking in the 43rd.</p> <p>Iraq, the US's greatest strategic blunder in at least 30 years, is Bush's fault. The buck stops there. And the more we learn about it, the clearer it becomes that it was pursued with a mixture of self-deception and lies. The reporter Ron Suskind has a new book out in which he recounts how, in the runup to war, British intelligence secured unique access to Saddam Hussein's head of intelligence, Tahir Jalil Habbush.</p> <p>Habbush told them what turned out subsequently to be the truth: that Saddam had ceased his programme of weapons of mass destruction, but would not admit it, because he was obsessed with keeping regional enemies such as Iran in a state of fear and uncertainty. That version was corroborated by Saddam's foreign minister, to whom French intelligence had originally secured access.</p> <p>The Bush-Cheney White House ignored both reports, preferring what turned out to be the fabrications of a German intelligence source codenamed Curveball. Curveball indeed. Some of Suskind's reporting has been questioned, but the basic story is not in doubt. The Bush-Cheney White House pressed ahead to war on a fraudulent prospectus, suppressing and distorting very important contrary evidence. As a senior member of the administration told Suskind: \"We're an empire now, and when we act we create our own reality.\" Hubris has rarely been better expressed.</p> <p>Something similar happened with the vertiginous unreality of hyper-leveraged Wall Street investment banking over the past decade. The financiers' motto, too, could have been \"We create our own reality\". Again, nemesis follows hubris as the night the day. The White House was not directly responsible for what looks like wild financial irresponsibility, but it was responsible for not supervising and regulating it - something even John McCain is now at least implicity admitting. The buck stopped there.</p> <p>As for the decline in American soft power, that is something for which George Bush was directly to blame. His arrogance, his unilateralism, his insensitivity, his long-time denial of the need for urgent action on climate change: all fed directly into the plummeting credit of the US around the world. It would have been a different story with a different president.</p> <p>For years now, we have seen those who hate the US abusing and burning effigies of Bush. The truth is, the anti-Americans should be building gilded monuments to him. For no one has done more to serve the cause of anti-Americanism than GW Bush. It is we who like and admire the US who should, by rights, be burning effigies. But now, at last, we live in hope of a better America.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.timothygartonash.com\"><br>timothygartonash.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Imagine the scene: the United Nations general assembly meets to discuss a resolution to the Israel-Palestine conflict. Unlike previous resolutions, which have been based on a Jewish state in most of historic Palestine with Palestinians relegated to the remnants, this one calls for a new state, covering what is now Israel, the West Bank and Gaza, whose present and former inhabitants are equal under the law. Such a resolution has, in fact, already been drafted and discussions have begun to place it on the agenda at the UN. </p> <p>The one-state solution is now part of mainstream discourse. Increasingly, Palestinians - and some Israelis - support it as the only alternative to a Palestinian state subordinate to Israel. One-state groups have sprung up and conferences and studies are under way.</p> <p>A UN resolution is the logical next step, underlining the issue's global importance and exposing the inequity and dishonesty of the two-state solution, to replace it with something fairer and more durable. It would be encapsulated in the following clauses, part of the draft UN resolution for a one-state solution, which has been under discussion for six months. Its principal authors are my fellow Palestinian Karl Sabbagh and myself:</p> <p>\"The general assembly notes the failure of recent efforts made by regional and international parties to resolve the conflict through the creation of two states; Recalling the recent history of the former [Palestine] Mandate territory as a land where Arabs and Jews shared equal rights of habitation; Reviewing Israel's non-compliance with UN Resolution 194, requiring Israel to repatriate the Palestinian refugees, and its illegal conduct in the occupied territories.</p> <p>\"Calls upon representatives of Israel and Palestine to agree on behalf of their peoples to share the land between the Mediterranean and the river Jordan ... by setting up a state which is democratic and secular, in which the rights of all people living within its borders to freedom of worship, security, and equality under the law are enshrined in a new constitution, to replace the separate forms of government that apply currently in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza.\" </p> <p>The two-state adherents will not approve. David Miliband at the Labour party conference this week continued to argue for a two-state solution. Tomorrow in New York, Mahmoud Abbas will petition George Bush for the same thing. Both are on a hiding to nothing. </p> <p>The pace of Israeli colonisation, unimpeded since 1967, redoubled after the Oslo accords, demonstrating Israel's aversion to a two-state solution. By 2007, the West Bank Jewish settler population had reached 282,000. In East Jerusalem, it rose to 200,000, massively Judaising the city and precluding it as a Palestinian capital. Today the West Bank is a jigsaw of settlements, bypass roads and barriers, making an independent state impossible. Gaza is a besieged enclave. In 2006 the UN special rapporteur in the Palestinian territories concluded that \"a two-state solution is unattainable\". Avraham Burg, former Knesset speaker, told the Israeli daily Haaretz in June that \"time was running out for the two-state solution\".</p> <p>Scores of others have articulated the same view. The peace process predicated on the two-state solution is stagnant, and a momentum has started towards the obvious alternative, a unitary state. This month a new forum, encompassing Palestinian personalities from the occupied territories and outside, has published a petition in the Arabic daily Al-Hayat to halt negotiations, annex the territories to Israel and demand equal rights in one state. This echoes many recent Palestinian demands to dissolve the Palestinian Authority and start an anti-apartheid campaign for equal rights. </p> <p>The UN high commissioner for human rights has referred us to Robert Serry, the UN official responsible for the peace process, who stated that UN policy must conform to the Palestinian formal position, the two-state solution. A change in that position is not unthinkable. For our resolution to be discussed at the UN, a member state would have to present it, and several are privately known to support our aims.</p> <p>A unitary state is inevitable. Establishing an exclusive state defined along ethnic-religious lines and excluding its previous inhabitants was unjust and ultimately unsustainable. No political acrobatics will alter this. The sooner the UN, which unwisely created Israel in the first place, takes charge of the consequences, the better it will be for Palestinians, for Israelis and for the region as a whole.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Ghada Karmi is research fellow at the Institute of Arab and Islamic Studies, Exeter University <a href=\"mailto:g.karmi@exeter.ac.uk\">g.karmi@exeter.ac.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Like a meteorite falling to earth, the government is beginning to fragment. Bits and pieces are breaking away under the strain, hardly held back by a conference and prime ministerial speech that were much better than expected. Ruth Kelly's resignation, confirmed by Downing Street at 3am in a Manchester hotel, was an odd episode, subject to rumour and denial. In the end the causes matter less than the instability it exacerbates. Collective effort holds government together; Gordon Brown has been losing ministers at a dangerous rate. </p> <p>Part of the prime minister's job is to create a sense of shared purpose and Ms Kelly's resignation, like the ones that came before, is a sign that he is still struggling to do it, for all the good feeling inside Labour that followed his speech. She said yesterday that her departure had nothing to with his leadership. Although that was not really convincing, it is true that she had decided to stand down long before and had reason to do so. Cabinet ministers are no less human than the rest of us, and Ms Kelly is not the first to choose between family and job - Estelle Morris was another. No one can doubt the strain of raising four children while managing a department. Everything Ms Kelly said yesterday about wanting to spend time with her family made sense, though the dispiriting message is that women (as well as many men) find Britain's politics abnormal and cruel. </p> <p>Whatever Ms Kelly thinks of the prime minister privately, she has certainly sprung a test on him: he has a vacancy to fill and probably a wider reshuffle to arrange (though rumours of reshuffles are more common than the real thing). How he goes about it could either revive the government, or end it - and prime ministers have more often got them wrong than right.</p> <p>Mr Brown is said to have been preoccupied with the possibility of replacing his chancellor, but, if only in passing, he might start by giving thought to the job Ms Kelly has just left. Transport has swallowed up nine Labour ministers in 11 years (not all of them allowed to attend cabinet) and been bounced from department to department. That is one reason why Britain's transport system is so much worse than it could be, and it is not about to get better. Even if Ms Kelly was wrong about the need for Heathrow's third runway, she was respected in the transport industry as some of her predecessors were not. There was no big idea, but she took sensible decisions with little fanfare, which for the most part is the best thing ministers can do. Whoever gets her job should continue that. </p> <p>If the prime minister thinks a different team could help make him the prime minister his supporters hoped he would be, but which he has failed to be all year, then he should carry out his reshuffle using whatever momentum he has gained from his speech. There is no reason to expect that a different cabinet would win back voters, to whom most ministers (and perhaps this set in particular) are anonymous faces. But if the prime minister does not trust his ministers to do their jobs, then he had better change some of them. He has been made slightly freer to choose by the Manchester conference. Mr Brown should not misuse this to further the careers of his oldest allies. He may want to make Ed Balls chancellor and Nick Brown chief whip, but that risks insurrection. Alistair Darling made an honest speech at the conference and it is not immediately obvious what moving him would achieve, especially since Mr Brown is so closely identified in the public mind with the economy. </p> <p>If the prime minister wants to do something daring, he might instead turn to the environment, where the current minister Hilary Benn has sadly faded into invisibility. If Mr Brown takes climate change as seriously as he says, he should greatly enhance that job and hand it to a champion. Would either Mr Balls or Mr Miliband (who once did it well) accept the challenge?</p>",
  "<p>Oh, the problem of success! The rock music landscape is littered with rich, famous artists who have squandered their credibility. But does the same danger lie in store for, er, circuses? If you think not, then you haven't seen La Clique, the cult cabaret show which next week takes up a London residency. After four years, theirs is still the overnight success story to end them all, with only one proviso: La Clique's popularity is intimately bound up with its underground sensibility. And, as their Norwegian \"rubber man\" Captain Frodo sagely remarks: \"Can you ever be truly underground when you're opening in the West End?\"</p> <p>Like rock music, a circus is not just entertainment; it's a repository of people's fantasies about how life might be. People run away to join the circus - not the theatre, or the conservatoire. At its scuzzy, romantic best, La Clique is the circus many of us would like to run away to. \"It's carnival,\" Captain Frodo tells me, backstage before a gig in Dublin last week. \"It's about every-thing that's hidden or dirty getting flaunted or celebrated. Just as church is a place of worship, La Clique is a place where you celebrate life. And you get it in both its beautiful and its ugly parts.\"</p> <p>Frodo, as he'd cheerily admit, represents the latter. In the current show, he dislocates his shoulders to squeeze his body through two string-less tennis rackets. The audience squirms in morbid fascination. Alongside Frodo, there are the English Gentlemen, who pick one another up with muscles that mere mortals don't possess; the buff young German David O'Mer, who takes an acrobatic, very sexy bath; and the Ukrainian Yulia Pikhtina, who spins hula-hoops simultaneously from every one of her extremities.</p> <p>Sitting in the front row, I am keenly aware that, with one false move from Yulia, my head might be hula-hooped off my shoulders. But that's the point, says La Clique's Australian founder and MC, Brett Haylock: \"The intimacy of the environment is key.\" For most of its life, La Clique has been housed in the Famous Spiegeltent, a 1920s Belgian travelling pavilion that pitches up annually on the Edinburgh Fringe. \"How that first show [in 2004] came together, I can't put my finger on,\" says Haylock. \"I certainly have no qualifications. But what I knew was that venue, intimately.\"</p> <p>At first, the tent was inseparable from La Clique's appeal. It positioned performers and audience cheek by jowl. \"You can see that these acts are real people doing real things,\" says Haylock. \"You can see them sweating right in front of you.\" But it also brought with it an atmosphere of faded, velveteen glamour (Marlene Dietrich once performed in the very same tent). \"It's a special environment,\" Haylock says. \"It travels with its ghosts, it comes from over 80 years of doing exactly what it's doing now: of pitching up, entertaining and then disappearing.\"</p> <p>But, at least for now, the Spiegeltent has disappeared from La Clique's story. The problem was that, while the tent toured successfully to Sydney and New York, no London berth was ever found. And then, this year, an improbable alternative was suggested. \"As you walk into the Hippodrome,\" says Haylock, \"you feel the hairs on the back of your neck. In my wildest dreams, I couldn't have imagined there'd be another space so suitable.\"</p> <p>If, like me, you only ever thought of London's Hippodrome as a tatty, sub-Stringfellows nightspot, prepare for a surprise. Designed by Frank Matcham in 1901 as a \"water circus\", the Hippodrome once played host to polar bears, sea lions and elephants in belle-\u00e9poque variety shows. Houdini and Judy Garland performed there. Managing director Charmaine Haig admits the venue has been a tawdry place these last 30 years. But under her stewardship, the fa\u00e7ade has been given a \u00a31.5m make-over to return it to its early 20th-century splendour. La Clique's residency, starting next week, is the first variety show at the venue since the 1970s.</p> <p>'It's perfect,\" says Haylock. \"We tap into all its history.\" After all, what is La Clique but a wilfully tawdry variety show? \"It's a tried and tested formula,\" says La Cirque's striptease artiste-cum-conjuror, Ursula Martinez. \"It's variety in that good, old-fashioned sense of the word.\" What distinguishes La Clique is its faster pace, and the sheer quality of its acts. Haylock has culled his performers from all walks of marginalised theatre life: Frodo had worked in freakshows; Martinez was a cabaret performer; the juggler Mario worked in street theatre; the English Gentlemen worked at Tokyo Disney.</p> <p>'It isn't rocket science,\" says Haylock. \"You can break all of the acts down to: sexy, funny, dangerous. And slightly twisted.\" Martinez agrees, but adds: \"There are moments of poetry, beauty and heart as well.\" Both believe La Clique is about more than displays of virtuosity. Its performers all have quirks, gimmicks, senses of humour - personalities, in short - that transcend their actual skills. But the show's appeal is more fundamental. As Frodo demonstrates for me the ancient art of shoving a spoon up one's nostril, I realise that, by dedicating years of their lives to honing totally impractical abilities, these performers afford us all an idiosyncratic perspective on how life might be lived away from the rat-race.</p> <p>Of course, that's what La Clique are anxious to preserve as mainstream success beckons. One Canadian newspaper once called them \"the anti-Cirque du Soleil\" - the opposite of that corporate extravaganza of soulless excellence. Can they stay that way? \"How do you get the word out there and get bums on seats?\" asks Martinez. \"And yet retain an element of cool, underground, alternative? That's a Catch-22.\" On this point, Haylock ties himself in more knots than Frodo. \"I've got to be careful what I say. But the day that our front row is full of, you know: safe, middle-class ... \" He stops himself: \"I'll have the London producers jumping up and down.\"</p> <p>So let's leave it to the contortionist to set things straight. \"La Clique just has to stay true to its roots,\" says Captain Frodo, and he withdraws a spoon from his nose.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 La Clique</strong> is at the Hippodrome, London WC2, from October 2.

  "<p>Calling all developers! City air starting to get to you? Cramped London flat, endless noise and a rapidly expanding waistline? <strong>Yahoo</strong> could have the answer...</p> <p>Formally launched today, Yahoo's new research and development centre at Grenoble, in south-east France, already employs 220 engineers and has now overtaken London as Yahoo's biggest European research centre. So just what did the UK miss out on when Yahoo chose to open in Grenoble?</p> <p>Grenoble has a significant heritage in the technology industry; <strong>Sun Microsystems</strong>, <strong>Hewlett Packard</strong> and <strong>Xerox</strong> are already here, and Yahoo itself came to Grenoble when it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/mar/26/yahoo.digitalmedia\">bought the shopping site <strong>Kelkoo</strong></a> four years ago. It likes to think of itself as the Silicon Valley of Europe. Today's official opening was marked with no small amount of fanfare - ribbon cutting and all - and an inauguration speech by <strong><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/lists/2007/11/biz-07women_Christine-Lagarde_24M5.html\">Christine Lagarde</a></strong>, France's formidable minister for economy, industry and employment.</p> <p><br><em>Christine Lagarde, French minister for the economy, industry and employment</em></p> <p>She told a swooning audience of French journalists, local dignitaries and Yahoos about changes implemented by Sarkozy's government in employment law in the past few months that make it much easier for multinationals to take employ in France; that, and a tax credit for research business that gives 30% back to the company, effectively tripling research budgets. Lagarde also said it was time to move away from the stereotype of France as a country of people who take long holidays and eat good food: \"There is another France, and it is the one you have fallen in love with and invested in.\"</p> <p>In turn <strong>John Linwood</strong>, Yahoo's senior vice president for international engineering, said Lagarde represented a \"a new energy in France about encouraging investment and attracting multinational companies\".</p> <p>\"We operate in a very competitive, multinational world,\" said Linwood. \"We do development all over the world, but it's important to find locations where we can find talent, work with the government and grow our business in an environment that is friendly to that. These changes have made it much more attractive as a company [to invest in France].\"</p> <p>Yahoo announced in March that it is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/mar/14/technology.yahoo\">shifting its European headquarters from London to Switzerland</a> - a decision due, in no small part, to various tax advantages, as well as a general cost-saving drive following months of shareholder frustration about the company's flagging share price. Is this just the next phase of moving out of over-priced London?</p> <p>\"You can see a number of other companies are considering their position within the UK,\" said <strong>Tim O'Donoghue</strong>, vice president for Yahoo engineering in Europe and Canada. \"A number have gone to Ireland and it's for those sort of reasons that the business looked at where best to locate the headquarters.\"</p> <p>Linwood added that Grenoble is not replacing London, and said a fifth of the staff there are still research based. \"We're not divesting from London. We have and continue to have a strong research presence there and if you look at our research centres they are magnets for all sorts of talent pools. You can't get it all in one location.\"</p> <p>\"There's a worldwide shortage of good tech talent,\" said Linwood. \"It's very difficult to attract and retain good talent, and that's not something unique to Yahoo but that happens to everyone.</p> <p>\"Worldwide the Yahoo strategy is to be in a number of places around the world where we can tap talent pools, looking at universities producing good graduates, actively partnering with universities, in Grenoble, for example, and working with them to help develop their curricula.\"</p> <p>The UK is strong on front end engineering and web development, media consumer internet and mobile, he said, while Grenoble is focusing on recommendation for Yahoo Answers, semantic search technology and the weighty service management that keeps Yahoo's services running.</p> <p>Yahoo Answers, which is a kind of question and answers tool with answers written and rated by users, has its research base at Grenoble. The service has 140 million users each month, Yahoo claims - more than the combined population of the UK and France.</p> <p>Answers has \"an aggressive roadmap of functionality,\" said O'Donoghue, and will integrate research on user relevance and information from social networks that can help determine the most relevant information for a user.</p> <p>Linwood said that <strong>Brickhouse</strong> - Yahoo's California-based concept incubator project and home of <strong>Fire Eagle</strong> - is in the process of being \"reinvented\", but said the favoured way of prioritising new projects is to identify a business need and ask teams to brainstorm prototypes that would solve those.</p> <p>Outside Europe, Yahoo has research centres in Haifa in Israel, Barcelona, Bangalore, Taipei, Taiwan and of course Sunnyvale in California, but also small centres in Brazil,Hong ong, Japan and Korea. What Grenoble offers is an existing tech community and a huge community of science and technology students; they account for more than 60,000 of Grenoble's wider population of around 250,000. London might be strong on mobile and creative web development, but can it match that combination of talent, tax breaks and quality of life?</p> <p>It doesn't seem to matter where in the world developers are; the language of the web - not to mention the Yahoo-branded desk detritus, in-geek joke screen savers and table football - is pretty international. That said, there aren't many offices where it's quite normal to fit in a snowboarding session before work.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Coming shortly: audio interview with Tim O'Donoghue.</em></p>",
  "<p>The US government has yielded to an outcry over multi-million dollar Wall Street pay packets by agreeing to impose limits on the remuneration of senior bankers who benefit from a $700bn bail-out of financial institutions.</p> <p>Treasury secretary Henry Paulson bowed to pressure after two days of tough negotiations with congressional lawmakers who are deeply reluctant to pass his program to buy up banks' distressed assets without a crackdown on perceived boardroom excess.</p> <p>\"The American people are angry about executive compensation, and rightly so,\" Paulson told the House financial services committee. \"We must find a way to address this in legislation without undermining the effectiveness of the program.\"</p> <p>The concession, which is likely to fuel momentum for similar measures in Britain, came as the Bush administration battled to overcome scepticism about the biggest public intervention in the financial markets since the Great Depression. </p> <p>Polls suggested that the US public are unenthusiastic about the bailout and Wall Street stocks slipped on doubts over the likelihood of an agreement this week. In an attempt to marshal support, the White House announced that President Bush would make a televised address about the financial crisis. </p> <p>Measures to reduce pay packages are set to include severe restrictions on \"golden parachutes\" given to executives when they leave their jobs. Wall Street sources expect a clawback on bonuses if companies re-state their financial performance and legislation to prohibit performance-related incentives which encourage inappropriate risk.</p> <p>Such changes are an about-turn for a laissez-faire Republican administration which last year rejected Congressional attempts to give shareholders a British-style \"say on pay\" vote at American companies. A crackdown poses a personal dilemma for Paulson who earned $38m as head of Goldman Sachs in 2005 before joining the government.</p> <p>In heated exchanges on the issue, Democratic congressman Luis Guitterez told Paulson: \"We are asking American taxpayers to sacrifice, to put $700bn out there when other people are lining their pockets.\"</p> <p>Paulson replied: \"People in the country understand pay for performance for success - that's the American dream. But nobody understands pay for failure.\"</p> <p>Critics of Wall Street point out that Lehman Brothers' chief executive, Dick Fuld, received nearly $35m in pay last year. Merrill Lynch's former boss Stan O'Neal left with $161m in stock and options when he was ousted due to huge losses on subprime mortgages in October.</p> <p>A poll released by the Los Angeles Times and Bloomberg showed that 55% of Americans oppose government aid to failing financial firms, in a sign that treasury secretary Henry Paulson is struggling to sell the scheme successfully. Paulson is staying in Washington to continue defending the plan and has turned down an invitation to meet Gordon Brown in New York today.</p> <p>The administration delivered increasingly dire warnings of the consequences of inactivity. The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, said global markets were under \"extraordinary stress\" and that action was \"urgently required\". The White House press secretary, Dana Perino, said there was a risk of \"financial calamity\" as \"the cold on Wall Street could affect main street\".</p> <p>As concern mounted in the markets, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 29 points to 10,825. Morgan Stanley's shares slumped 11% as takeover talks with the commercial banking group Wachovia ended.<br>Deutsche Bank analysts said the market was \"skittish\" on concerns that the Treasury may get less than the $700bn it wants, with the possibility of strings attached. Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup, said \"bailout fatigue\" was setting in.</p> <p>\"A real sense of crisis has eluded many members [of Congress] who may not fully grasp the linkage between financial markets and their impact on the people of Main Street who elect their representatives in government,\" said Levkovich in a note to clients.</p> <p>The Los Angeles Times's poll was not the only attempt to read the US public's pulse on the financial crisis. CNN found that 62% of Americans support government involvement in the markets but 65% believe that any bailout would be unfair to taxpayers. Several tongue-in-cheek websites sprung up in which Americans offered junk for sale to the Treasury at inflated prices \u2013 on one, contributors offered a broken printer for $300 and a Bollywood poster for $4.76m.</p> <p>Former president Jimmy Carter joined the chorus of criticism, describing Paulson's plan as \"extremely faulty\" in lacking checks and balances: \"It's only three pages in outline. It gives him dictatorial power with no supervision.\"</p> <p>Senior Wall Street names have offered their services in helping the treasury to buy up investments. Bill Gross, who manages the world's biggest bond fund, Pimco, said he would help the treasury manage the program free of charge.</p> <p>A sense of anger over Wall Street's role in sparking the meltdown was fuelled by news that the FBI is investigating the possibility of fraud at four troubled firms caught up in financial turmoil - AIG, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Lehman Brothers.</p> <p>Doubts about the program cut across party lines. One-time Republican presidential hopeful Ron Paul summed up the tumult: \"I don't know who the conservatives are and who the liberals are.\"</p>",
  "<p>While we're on the subject of bailouts, here's a candidate: <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/18/education/18grant.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin\">Pell grants</a>, the largest federal aid programme, is projecting a $6bn shortfall next year, as students increasingly apply for financial assistance to attend college. The causes, unlike some other bailouts of late, don't require a translator to understand. As the economy continues to struggle, more students require financial assistance to pay for college, and the poor job market has simultaneously led many mid-career students to seek higher education and skills training. By the end of July, 800,000 more students had applied for federal aid than the previous year.</p> <p>This should be welcome news, because it indicates what was already believed to be true \u2013 a greater number of students are going to college, and a higher percentage of those students are from low-income brackets. Since lifetime earnings are tied to educational attainment, encouraging access to college will be good for our nation's financial future - but only if the government steps up to meet the demand.</p> <p>Created in 1972, the Pell grant programme distributes annual awards to low-income students ranging from $431 to $4,731. This year over six million students will receive aid, many of whom would not be able to access higher education without it. However, the programme has failed to keep pace with increasing enrolment and rapidly rising college tuitions. Congress appropriated $14bn for the current fiscal year, (some of which was itself meant to absorb previous shortages) but without the $6bn increase, the programme will need to reduce the size of its grants. </p> <p>The Pell shortfall has the misfortune of coinciding with a federal budget that is shrinking by the news cycle, particularly as the government continues to rescue failing financial companies like Bear Stearns and AIG with hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars. A mere $6bn for college access may not seem like much in comparison, but if that funding were to be lost it would represent an embarrassing double standard on the part of the US government. As policymakers throw around rhetoric about long-term economic solutions and defend the financial bailouts as safeguarding America's economy, the ties between education and that economy must not be ignored. </p> <p>Two-thirds of new jobs require higher education or advanced training, but only about half of US students who enrol in four-year colleges after high school earn a bachelor's degree within six years. What's more, while college attendance is on the rise, college completion is at a stalemate \u2013 out of 23 countries, the US was the only nation that showed no increase in its postsecondary graduation rate between 2000 and 2005. </p> <p>While Pell grants may not cover a student's entire tuition, they do increase the likelihood that a student can afford to stay in college long enough to graduate, making the difference between having to work 30 hours a week on top of classes, or taking out excessive loans to pay for their education. However, reports indicate that the <a href=\"http://www.educationsector.org/analysis/analysis_show.htm?doc_id=559757\">default rate</a> on loans to low-income students is also increasing, leading one to question whether the limited availability of aid like Pell grants will cause more students determined to go to college to fall into debt. As <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/19/opinion/l19econ.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1\">one student wrote in the New York Times last week</a> to the heads of the US Federal Reserve and Treasury: </p> <blockquote> <p>Dear Mr Bernanke and Mr Paulson:<br>My student loans are too big and it is hurting the economy. Can I have a bailout, please? I need $92,000. Thanks.</p> </blockquote> <p>Both presidential candidates speak about college access and improving educational attainment as a means of competing in a global marketplace. Earlier this month, <a href=\"http://my.barackobama.com/page/community/post/amandascott/gG5pB4\">Barack Obama told an audience</a> in Ohio: \"If we want to see middle-class incomes rising like they did in the 1990s, we can't afford a future where so many Americans are priced out of college \u2026 where millions of jobs are going unfilled because Americans don't have the skills to work them and where barely one in 10 low-income students will ever get their college degree.\" John McCain <a href=\"http://www.johnmccain.com/informing/news/PressReleases/ed12978d-a54f-471e-aeed-65c65bcba6da.htm\">wants to simplify financial aid</a> and argues that higher education is as much a part of economic competition as the job sector. </p> <p>It's time for the US to put its money where its mouth is. If lawmakers can see the need to save Bear Stearns and AIG from bankruptcy in the name of strengthening the nation, surely it can also step in to give the students who will carry our economy into the 21st century the support they deserve.</p>",
  "<p>Laos, one of the poorest countries in south-east Asia, with few resources beyond its mighty rivers and unspoilt natural beauty, is under threat from a plethora of dam projects and foreign companies hellbent on harnessing the surging torrents.</p> <p>Environmental specialists and NGOs report that rivers are being ruined, fish stocks rapidly depleted, and thousands of villagers uprooted from their homes.</p> <p>The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank have strongly pushed the Laotian government, with its meagre human resources, to open up their rivers to hydroelectric power (HEP) as the key to development.</p> <p>Among the western and Chinese companies plundering the natural resources of Laotian waterways are Norwegian ones. Norway, which usually prides itself on respect for the environment and human rights, is not among the usual suspects of countries that ride roughshod over local communities and their livelihoods.</p> <p>You don't expect Norway, with its record of stringent environmental standards at home, to be accused of flouting rules for environmental impact assessments (EIAs), ignoring dangers and ruining important rivers by cutting corners in dam construction. But that is exactly what it is doing through with its participation in the Theun-Hinboun Power Company (THPC) according to respected British scientist Dr Murray Watson, hired as an environmental specialist to implement the EIA under the control of a Norwegian consulting company Norplan.</p> <p>Only recently, the Norwegian government <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/09/riotinto.ethicalbusiness?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=business\">withdrew</a> its \u00a3500m pension fund investment in Rio Tinto Zinc on the grounds of what Norway's finance minister, Kirsten Halvorsen termed \"an unacceptable risk of contributing to grossly unethical conduct\". </p> <p>In this high-profile case, Norway's reputation for green ethics was enhanced, but there is no sign of the same principles being applied to little-known dams in Laos.</p> <p>In 2004 Watson's research consultancy body <a href=\"http://www.rmruk.com/Theteam.html\">RMR</a> was contracted to conduct the EIA for the Theun-Hinboun dam expansion project in the country.</p> <p>But Watson's findings about serious environmental damage were either deleted or ignored from the Norwegian company's presentation of the EIA.</p> <p>Time and again compliant EIA consultants have played down the environmental dangers, to enable a controversial project to proceed smoothly. But Watson blew the whistle, went public and <a href=\"http://www.internationalrivers.org/en/southeast-asia/laos/theun-hinboun/lao-dam-cover-scientist-protests-deceptive-eia-report\">informed the media</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>In the last 30 years working as an EIA practitioner in Africa and south-east Asia, RMR have not seen any EIA report which so steadfastly supports the developer's actions and plans, against the interests of other stakeholders and the national environment.</p> </blockquote> <p>The statement he made continues: \"They are deceiving the Laos government. The costs of these impacts [from the Theun-Hinboun dam] will definitely seriously impoverish 10,000-15,000 people, probably will moderately impoverish a further 10,000-15,000.\"</p> <p>Norplan has closed down the EIA since it delivered its wildly inaccurate report, and their only response has been to say that the company has no power to amend its draft final report now that the contract term has expired.</p> <p>Never mind that Watson, the chief expert, has presented a dossier to show that the report is riddled with deception and has totally dissociated himself from its conclusions. It appears the integrity and accuracy of the EIA and the welfare of the people of Laos is of less concern than the date of expiry of the contract.</p> <p>Sadly, there is no indication that the Norwegian government is concerned about its tarnished reputation in Laos, despite the direct involvement of Statkraft, the state-owned electricity company, which has a 20% in the THPC. Construction is now set to commence.</p> <p>\"I am stunned that Statkraft and Norplan \u2013 companies from one of the richest and most advanced countries in the world \u2013 would put their name and reputation behind such abysmal studies. This shows that they care little about the fate of some of the poorest people in south-east Asia\", said <a href=\"http://www.internationalrivers.org/en/southeast-asia/laos/theun-hinboun/theun-hinboun-dam-nightmare-revealed-resettlement-plan-and-eia-rid\">Aviva Imhof</a>, campaigns director of International Rivers Network. </p> <p>Why such a stark contradiction between Oslo's ethical concern over Rio Tinto Zinc's operations and the neglect of similar issues in Laos?</p> <p>In this case Oslo has ignored all protests, including those of the Norwegian NGO <a href=\"http://www.fivas.org/sider/tekst.asp?side=1\">Fivas</a>. Andrew Preston, the director of Fivas agues that it is untenable for Statkraft, a company with ambitions of being a world leader in the provision of \"clean energy\", to continue investing in this Laotian dam project.</p> <p>Other prospective dam projects in Laos and China seriously threaten the future of one of the world's great rivers \u2013 the Mekong \u2013 which provides food, security and livelihoods for an estimated 70 million people.</p> <p>The machinations of Norwegian companies, in brushing aside the evidence and ignoring Watson's principled protests, could do enormous damage Oslo's reputation for taking ethical concerns seriously.</p> <p>But much worse than that: by abandoning certain standards, it sets the worst possible example to all the other dam developers. Unless some environmental checks are put in place, future generations of fishermen along the banks of the Mekong and other rivers will be reduced to uttering a plaintive cry of \"Where have all the fish gone?\"</p>",

  "<p>\"We must do more \u2013 and we must do it now.\" This urgent call for action is being aired loudly in both New York and Washington DC this week. On Capitol Hill, Congress is being urged to accept <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/24/wallstreet.georgebush\">Henry Paulson's $700bn bail-out</a> for Wall Street's beleaguered banks, whereas just over 200 miles up Interstate 95 at the UN headquarters in Turtle Bay big wigs from around the world are pondering how the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/\">millennium development goals</a> \u2013 this week marks the halfway point towards their 2015 target \u2013 are ever going to be met given the woeful progress to date.</p> <p>It's at times like this where you really get to see the naked truth about where our worldly priorities lie. And it's pretty hard not to think about what $700bn would buy you if you were pushing the trolley around the Truly Worthy Causes supermarket.</p> <p>Causes don't come much more worthy than the eight millennium development goals, which together form a panoply of unquestionably important aims: eradicate extreme poverty and hunger; achieve universal primary education; promote gender equality and empower women; reduce child mortality; improve maternal health; combat HIV/Aids, malaria and other diseases; ensure environmental sustainability; and develop a global partnership for development. But as today's special Guardian supplement <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/alloutonpoverty\">All Out On Poverty</a> illustrates, we have a long, long way to go if we're ever to meet most of these goals, let alone by 2015 which seems as absurdly optimistic a deadline now as it did back in 2000 when it was first announced. In fact, with some goals we have arguably slipped into reverse gear rather than advance towards them.</p> <p>Goal-setting can be a strange science. Surely, the UN knew full well that most of these goals were next to impossible to achieve within 15 years? Yet the logic goes that without these goals, progress is difficult to measure and, furthermore, efforts to address these problems can drift or dissipate without the ticking clock and watchful eyes that accompany such targets. This is the central thesis of our much-derided \"target culture\", targets are there to incrementally raise standards and to ensure accountability. Therefore, we now have targets for our schools, our police forces, our local authorities and our hospitals. Sometimes you even wonder whether there is a target to set more targets.</p> <p>But as so many of our teachers, nurses and police officers seem to keep telling us, targets are a highly impersonal, some would say inhuman, tool by which to measure progress and achieve results, especially when they're used to judge intangibles such as human \"development\". And what happens when, heady with idealism, you set the target far too high? Does it still drive you on to achieve it, or do you later give up knowing that your efforts are likely to be a waste of time?</p> <p>My own suspicion is that they can often fuel disillusionment and cynicism. For example, Gordon Brown spoke again this week of trying to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/24/labourconference.children\">completely eliminate child poverty by 2020</a>. What a glorious ambition, but why does it leave me feeling somewhat empty? Probably because I know that it is highly unlikely to be met. Is this due to the vagaries of the messenger, or the difficulty of the task at hand? Probably a bit of both, but it makes me wonder whether we still react to grand ambition and goal setting in the same way we did back when, say, the Apollo \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g25G1M4EXrQ\">We Choose to go to the Moon</a>\" mission got us to that lump of cheese within just a decade, or when the National Health Service was created 50 years ago out of the rubble of the second world war. </p> <p>Many people now speak of the need for an Apollo-type goal to help herald a new era of low-carbon technologies, but we seem to have become immune to such ambitious rhetoric. Have we now reached the point where the setting of grand targets, so often parcelled in emotive speeches by our leaders, has become a tarnished ploy to force positive change? (What was the last grand-aim speech you were genuinely moved by?) And if so, what will we respond to?</p>",
  "<p>So it's all over, and to be honest the political markets have closed at the end of Labour's party conference not that far off where they were at the start. </p> <p>Quite a few people have sold Milibands, shares in Purnell have risen a bit - more in hope than expectation - while Ruth Kelly appears to have mysteriously nationalised herself. </p> <p>The conference hall certainly bought Brown, although it's not clear whether the rest of the country is exactly filling its boots. But while a good speech boosts confidence it doesn't answer bigger questions about whether he can run a government. Now the spotlight shifts to the Tory conference in Birmingham next week. So what should they do with it? </p> <p>The thesis of Brown's speech was essentially that he may be a bit dour, but, hey, we're all going to be dour once the recession hits, and in tough times who needs a \"hello sunshine, hello trees\" Tory skipping around annoying people? </p> <p>Therefore David Cameron's job is to answer the charge that he's a lightweight novice by radiating gravity, intellect and statesmanlike qualities without losing his most appealing qualities to voters - ie charm, optimism and not being Gordon Brown. </p> <p>Perhaps he could get Samantha Cameron to introduce him? She could give a lecture about the origins of the global banking crisis, complete with detailed graphs ... </p> <p>George Osborne almost has the tougher gig, explaining an economic policy built on sharing the proceeds of economic growth now there probably won't be any growth to share - which means not just deferring tax cuts, but logically possibly cutting spending too. </p> <p>Osborne has started gently shifting the goalposts (see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/08/georgeosborne.conservatives\">his recent Guardian interview</a> suggesting the Tories weren't as committed to matching Labour spending plans as some MPs feared) but must flesh this out - plus he urgently needs to sort out what the Tories think about City regulation. </p> <p>Do they still want people to make as much money as they can, or do they give in to public pressure to restrict excessive risk-taking in the City? <a href=\"http://www.johnredwoodsdiary.com/2008/09/22/what-should-the-uk-do-now/\">John Redwood has been blogging about some interesting stuff on this</a>.<br> Dominic Grieve, a clever man but one of nature's mild-mannered janitors, also has a tough job since the shadow home secretary's speech is still the one a lot of traditionalist Tories come to hear. </p> <p>Oh, and nobody should get into a lift without first checking for earwigging BBC reporters ...</p>",
  "<p>Reports generated by that vague band, \"a team of researchers from Exeter University\", are usually little more than machines for generating scepticism, but this time the team done good. You may have read it in today's paper: apparently, the more people bang on about how ecologically aware they are, the more likely they are to nip off on a plane for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/24/ethicalliving.recycling\">skiing holiday</a>, or some other indulgence.</p> <p>It is, of course, usually a bad idea to do your research in order to confirm a pre-existing hunch, but in this case I think the good researchers of Exeter University can be forgiven. For surely, someone, somewhere, must have thought \"I smell a rat\" when confronted by piety in green matters. We all know someone like that: the affluent couple who, when they come round to visit and remark archly on why you aren't sorting out your rubbish into different categories, do so in a trail of Mercedes fumes, their frequent-flier air miles almost jangling audibly in their pockets.</p> <p>It confirms as a rule what common sense might have suggested was normally only the exception: that sanctimoniousness is little more than a leper-bell for hypocrisy; virtually a guarantee of it. We love it when this happens on a grand and comic scale: the politician preaching self-restraint caught fiddling the books, the ranting pastor discovered (in Martin Amis's memorable phrase) under a heap of prostitutes. But this is the lesson to be learned today: that the wagging finger can, when it comes to matters of personal ethics, be contemptuously ignored. (I loved the quote from one tosser pulled from the research so much I'm going to repeat it here: \"I recycle 100% of what I can, there's not one piece of paper goes in my bin, so that makes me feel less guilty about flying as much as I do.\")</p> <p>In case you're wondering, I have to admit having done the eco-nag myself, largely in the area of trying to discourage the family from flying to skiing resorts. I forebear to mention that flying accounts for only 2 or 3% of greenhouse emissions (although if someone would care to correct me with some plausible facts, I will welcome it). My secret reason for discouraging the family from flying to skiing resorts is because I loathe airports the way people used to loathe international fascism, and I can think of several hundred better things to do with my time than skiing. (The problem has since resolved itself with my forcible ejection from the family, but that's another story, except that it's made me learn that the best way to go green is to be completely skint. Apparently lots of people are trying this these days.)</p> <p>Dr Johnson, as so often, was right about this. \"No man,\" he observed, \"was ever a hypocrite in his pleasures\". In other words, you can find out someone's true character from what they do for fun. Sadly, though, in this depraved age, people are often total hypocrites <em>about</em> their pleasures.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337944908\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1815618897_gdn-nat-080924-sf-waves-02-VFa-4x3.flv\"/> </video>   <p>From a distance, they look like nothing more than thin red lines on the horizon, easily lost amid the tumbling blue of the Atlantic Ocean. But get closer and the significance of the 140m-long tubes, 10 years in the making by a British company and now floating in the sea off the coast of Portugal, becomes apparent: they are the beginning of an entirely new industry in the hunt for clean power.</p> <p>Yesterday, the red snake-like devices were inaugurated as part of the world's first commercial-scale wave-power station, three miles from the coast of the northern Portuguese town of Agu\u00e7adoura. The project, which will generate clean electricity for more than 1,000 family homes in its first phase, marks the latest step in Portugal's moves to become a leader in developing renewable energy sources.</p> <p>At the heart of the Agu\u00e7adoura power station are three cylindrical wave energy converters, designed and built by the Edinburgh-based company Pelamis Wave Power. Moving up and down on the endless supply of waves in the open sea, they convert the motion into electricity, without emitting any of the carbon dioxide responsible for warming the planet. </p> <p>\"The future of wave energy starts today,\" said Manuel Pinho, Portugal's economics minister. </p> <p>\"Finland is very good in mobile phones, Portugal wants to be good in renewable energy. We are among the top five in the world, and we are just in the beginning of the process. </p> <p>\"Renewable energy is the source of energy for the future and we think this can create an industrial revolution and a lot of opportunities for jobs and research and we want to be ahead of the curve.\"</p> <p><strong>Peak output</strong></p> <p>At peak output, the Pelamis wave machines near Agu\u00e7adoura will generate 2.25MW, enough for the annual needs of about 1,500 family homes. Eventually, the station will be expanded with a further 25 Pelamis machines so that it can generate up to 21MW of power. That will save 60,000 tonnes of CO2 per year compared with a conventional fossil fuel plant.</p> <p>\"If you compare it to wind energy, wave is more predictable and is more sustained typically,\" said Ian Sharp of Babcock and Brown, the company that built and commissioned the Agu\u00e7adoura wave farm.</p> <p>Each of semi-submerged Pelamis devices is 142m long, has a diameter of 3.5m and is made from 700 tonnes of carbon steel. A single wave converter is composed of four articulated sections that move up and down as the waves pass along it. At each of the hinges between the sections, hydraulic rams use the wave motion to drive generators to produce up to 750KW of power at peak output.</p> <p>The electricity generated by the three Pelamis devices will be carried by undersea cable to a substation in Agu\u00e7adoura, which will then feed the power into the Portuguese national grid. </p> <p>In addition to this flagship wave power, the Portuguese are investing heavily in other renewable technologies. They are already spending \u00a3250m on more than 2,500 solar photovoltaic panels to build the world's largest solar farm near the small town of Moura in eastern Portugal. It will have twice the collecting area of London's Hyde Park and supply 45MW of electricity each year, enough to power 30,000 homes.</p> <p>In the past three years, the country has also trebled its hydroelectric capacity and quadrupled its wind power sources \u2013 northern Portugal has the world's biggest wind farm with more than 130 turbines and a factory that builds the 40m-long blades.</p> <p>Pinho wants Portugal to rival Denmark or Japan in its commitment to developing renewables industries \u2013 he predicts his country will generate 31% of all its primary energy from clean sources by 2020, compared with Britain's target of 15%. The Portuguese target means increasing the generation of electricity from renewable sources from 42% in 2005 to 60% in 2020. </p> <p><strong>'Time to take note'</strong></p> <p>Greenpeace UK's chief scientist, Doug Parr, said the UK government's energy secretary, John Hutton, should take urgent note of the developments in Portugal. \"Wave technology invented in Scotland is powering Portuguese homes and making money for Portuguese suppliers, because our government has consistently neglected the renewables industry here in the UK.\"</p> <p>The \u20ac9m (\u00a37.14m) first phase of the Agu\u00e7adoura project, which involves the energy firms Enersis and Energias de Portrugal, has been helped partly by the Portuguese government agreeing to guarantee a premium for the electricity the station will generate via a feed-in tariff of 25c per KWh. The project has also been given a \u20ac1.25m grant from the Portuguese Ag\u00eancia de Inova\u00e7\u00e3o.</p> <p>\"The Portuguese government has moved forward on wave energy more quickly than has happened in the UK,\" said Sharp. </p> <p>\"[In Portugal] we have a feed-in tariff arrangement so we had a guaranteed price for the power that was produced and you don't have that in the UK. The environment here was better to stimulate development.\"</p> <p>Parr said there could be dire consequences for the UK unless the government got its act together in developing renewable industries: \"There is a danger that jobs, investment and clean energy will go overseas because of Hutton's obsession with old technologies like coal and nuclear power. </p> <p>\"It's time we stopped the rot before our performance on renewables becomes a national disgrace.\"</p> <p>Friends of the Earth's renewable energy campaigner, Nick Rau, said that wave and tidal power could play a significant role in tackling climate change and reducing the UK's dependency on fossil fuels. \"The potential for this technology in the UK is enormous - but the government is not doing enough to develop it.\"</p> <p>In the UK, Pelamis is also involved in the South West Development Agency's project to build a wave power station off the north coast of Cornwall, called Wavehub. This will be the UK's first offshore facility for demonstrating a commercial-scale wave power plant - but it is not expected to be operational until at least 2010. The SWDA estmates the project could create 1,800 jobs and inject \u00a3560m into the British economy.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Thursday September 25 2008. We should have made it clear that Manuel Pinho's prediction that Portugal will be generating 31% of all its \"power\" from clean sources by 2020 referred to primary energy. Also, we implied that Portugal generates 20% of its electricity from renewable sources. This figure should have been 42%. These errors have been corrected.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/warrenbuffett\">Warren Buffett</a> today agreed to invest $5bn (\u00a32.7bn) in Goldman Sachs, giving the bank a strong vote of confidence following the tumultuous Wall Street events of the past few weeks.</p> <p>Analysts hailed the move by Buffett - known as the Sage of Omaha - as a sign that some stability could be returning to the markets, with UBS calling it \"the ultimate stamp of approval\".</p> <p>Buffett, the world's second richest man, acted after Goldman and Morgan Stanley <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/23/morganstanley.goldmansachs\">changed their status from investment banks to more traditional banks</a>, ending a Wall Street era. </p> <p>\"I am to some effect betting on the fact that the government will do the rational thing and act properly,\" he told CNBC. \"We had a lot of cash, and we are now seeing things that give us a chance to use that cash sensibly. </p> <p>\"Five years from now, ten years from now, we will look back at this period and we will say you could have made some extraordinary buys. </p> <p>\"The American economy over a period of time will do very well, and people that own a piece of it will do very well.\"</p> <p>After the wild swings in shares over the past fortnight, news of his investment calmed the London stock market today. </p> <p>The FTSE 100 rose in early trading and traded down 24.6 points at 5111.5 points in mid-afternoon. </p> <p>Shares in Goldman rose 2.7% to $128.44 when New York trading resumed, and the Dow Jones industrial average was up 3.26 points at 10856.16 points.</p> <p>Buffett is widely admired for his astute, common sense approach to investment, and the annual meetings for his Berkshire Hathaway company in his hometown of Omaha, Nebraska, draw huge crowds. </p> <p>Earlier this year, he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/may/19/useconomy.equities\">toured Europe looking for acquisition targets</a>. </p> <p>Until now, he had held off buying stakes in any of the financial companies hit by the credit crunch, instead favouring <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/apr/29/fooddrinks.acquisitions\">a deal for the chewing gum maker Wrigley's</a>.</p> <p>\"Goldman Sachs is an exceptional institution,\" Buffett said yesterday, citing its \"unrivaled global franchise, a proven and deep management team and the intellectual and financial capital to continue its track record of outperformance\".</p> <p>Lloyd Blankfein, the Goldman chairman and chief executive, said he viewed the deal with Buffett as \"a strong validation of our client franchise and future prospects\".</p> <p>Goldman will also sell $5bn worth of common stock to the public, and priced the offering of 40.65m common shares at $123 each. </p> <p>The offer is double the amount the bank yesterday said it would raise as part of a plan to boost its capital base.</p> <p>The capital-raising plan came as the US treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, visited Washington to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/24/wallstreet.georgebush\">defend a planned $700bn Wall Street bailout</a>.</p> <p>In a separate move, the Japanese financial powerhouse Sumitomo Mitsui was also reported to be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/24/goldmansachs.wallstreet\">planning a large investment in Goldman Sachs</a>.</p> <p>Earlier this week, Morgan Stanley raised around $8bn by selling a 20% stake to Japan's largest commercial bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial.</p> <p>Both Goldman and Morgan Stanley maintained that their businesses were sound in recent weeks even as Lehman Brothers went bankrupt and Merrill Lynch sought shelter by selling itself to Bank of America for $50bn. </p> <p>Goldman has remained profitable, although its earnings have taken a hit. However, the fear in the markets put Goldman and Morgan Stanley under pressure, regardless of any reassurances.</p> <p>Berkshire Hathaway will take preferred shares in return for the investment, and will have the right to buy a further $5bn in ordinary shares at $115 a share at any time over the next five years.</p> <p>Analysts said the deal had been structured in such a way as to protect Buffett's investment from being wiped out.</p> <p>Tim Ghriskey, the chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management in New York, said; \"It is certainly a vote of confidence in Goldman and their new structure. </p> <p>\"Any time Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway step in and invest in something, everybody takes notice.\"</p> <p>Under their new status, Goldman and Morgan Stanley will have to reduce the amount they can borrow relative to capital ratios and will be subject to greater regulation, but will also be able to borrow money from the Federal Reserve.</p> <p>Anton Schutz, a portfolio manager at Mendon Capital Advisors in Rochester, New York, said the government bailout for the financial sector meant it was a \"great time to be buying\".</p>",
  "<p>The scare over Chinese dairy products reached Britain today as Tesco announced it was removing milk sweets from its shelves as a precautionary measure.</p> <p>New Zealand authorities warned the White Rabbit brand contained \"unacceptable\" levels of melamine.</p> <p>At least twelve countries, from Indonesia to Kenya to Colombia, have now banned Chinese dairy imports amid fears sparked by tainted milk powder that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/23/china.food\">has killed four Chinese babies</a> and made tens of thousands ill, including five in Hong Kong and Macau. Around 100 are still in a serious condition.</p> <p>Several more countries have stepped up testing after melamine, which can cause kidney stones and even kidney failure, was found in products ranging from fresh milk to cakes and biscuits. The chemical, used in making plastics and fertiliser, should not be added to food - but boosts apparent protein levels in tests.</p> <p>So far all the cases of illness have been linked to infant formula from Sanlu, the company at the heart of the scandal. Products from other large dairy firms showed lower levels of the substance.</p> <p>A senior Chinese product safety official insisted that the problem was \"under control, more or less\" and Premier Wen Jiabao, speaking on a visit to New York, said the government would use the crisis as an opportunity to overhaul safety controls.</p> <p>\"There is no problem,\" Xiang Yuzhang, the national quality watchdog's chief inspection official, told reporters in Beijing. \"It has been brought under control, more or less. There are no more problems in the market. As far as I know, there will be no more bad news.\"</p> <p>Tesco today said it had withdrawn White Rabbit Creamy Candies - sold in a small number of their stores - but had no evidence they were tainted. </p> <p>New Zealand's Food Safety Authority warned they had found \"unacceptable\" contamination in the imported sweets. \"This product contains sufficiently high levels of melamine which may, in some individuals, cause health problems such as kidney stones,\" the authority's deputy chief executive, Sandra Daly, said in a statement.</p> <p>She urged people to seek medical advice if they or their children had eaten the sweets, adding: \"This is a serious concern.\"</p> <p>Singapore's Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority had already reported the presence of melamine. Bright Food Group, the manufacturer, told local media it was checking the product.</p> <p>Since the scandal first emerged two weeks ago, bans and checks have been introduced worldwide and have spread from dairy products to those that may contain milk.</p> <p>The European Union does not allow Chinese dairy imports but has already urged customs authorities to intensify checks on products such as bread and chocolate.</p> <p>A Chinese official apologised to consumers in Taiwan as authorities there ordered China-made milk products and vegetable-based proteins off store shelves pending testing.</p> <p>Indonesia warned that retailers face up to five years in jail and a \u00a3100,000 fine if they fail to remove from sale 28 products - including Oreo cookies and M&amp;Ms - until testing is completed.</p> <p>Kraft Foods said Oreo products do not contain any dairy from China, while Mars, maker of M&amp;Ms, said it does not use ingredients from China's blacklisted firms.</p> <p>Australia advised citizens overseas to avoid all Chinese-made milk products, unless companies have confirmed their goods are free from contamination, and the US Food and Drug Administration has expanded its sampling of Asian imports to dairy-based candies and desserts.</p> <p>Malaysia ordered safety inspections for many Chinese food imports, including those without milk.</p> <p>But Anthony Hazzard, a World Health Organization advisor on food security, said: \"I think the greatest fear is if there has been illegal movement of the heavily contaminated products rather than the legal movement of products that may have very low levels of melamine.\"</p> <p>The Chinese ministry of commerce has acknowledged that the milk food scandal had \"hurt the reputation of Chinese products\", adding that producers and exporters will be subjected to stricter inspections.</p> <p>Four years ago Premier Wen apologised after the cover-up over Sars and the government promised to toughen safety regimes last year, after a spate of product scares.</p> <p>But Yang Fengchun of Peking University's school of government told the Associated Press news agency: \"Although after Sars, the government promised a more open media environment and to protect people's right of expression, without essential measures, it's just empty talk. What is really needed is to change the system's framework.</p> <p>\"The government and companies have lied to people, so it becomes very difficult to make people believe again in what they say.\"</p> <p>Hans Troedsson, WHO's representative in Beijing, warned: \"What needs to be stepped up is supervision, inspection and regulation at the local level.\"</p>",
  "<p>Not before time, \"green\" industry has recognised that if you equate environmental friendliness with the ability to save a lot of money, businesses suddenly become much keener. Bolstering the company brand and impressing customers, while also having a board-pleasing impact on the bottom line, is a winning formula.</p> <p>British businesses fritter away close to \u00a37m a day, according to the Carbon Trust. Combining such statistics with its own findings, utility company E.ON, which is currently running a campaign to change employee behaviour in small businesses, estimates that an average office wastes \u00a36,000 a year and 3.36 tonnes of carbon dioxide through sloppy practices. </p> <p>E.ON has found the biggest problem is changing the company mindset when it comes to being more frugal. Almost 80% of workers admit to failing to transfer good practice at home to the office. Worse still, almost two-thirds currently ignore company policy on environmental initiatives, a trend especially pronounced among SMEs.</p> <h2>Waste awareness</h2> <p>\"At home, consumers seem to be more aware of wastage and will make a greater effort to switch off a light, turn off a dripping tap or recycle, but in the office this consciousness is less pronounced,\" says Roger Papworth, programme delivery manager at sustainable business consultancy Envirowise. People feel less accountable and less visible at work, plus they're not paying for the services.</p> <p>Businesses are now more cash-strapped than ever and energy costs continue to soar. If employee apathy is to be overcome, green initiatives must be driven from the top. A costings wake-up call spurs even the smallest enterprise into action.</p> <p>Typically, energy constitutes the second biggest business expense after staff salaries. Simple measures such as turning down the heating or the air conditioning by just one or two degrees can save 6%\u20138% on a company's overall energy costs. Be more selective in use of office lighting and that's another 10% saving. \"If a business is spending \u00a3500,000 a year on energy consumption, a 20% reduction in power use adds up to a \u00a3100,000 saving,\" says Tom Fidell, an energy conservation engineer at energyteam, which specialises in advising businesses in this area.</p> <p>Happily, the biggest savings can be achieved for free or very little. The key to change is educating and motivating employees to cut down on their energy wastage \u2014 encouraging them to switch off lights, for example. </p> <p>\"Heating should not need to be set above 19 degrees, nor air conditioning below 24 degrees,\" Fidell says. \"It is absurd that people have to wear jumpers at work in the summer because the office has been overcooled. What happened to adapting to the seasons?\"</p> <p>When it comes to lighting, companies may need to invest a small amount in new controls that allow the system to be \"zoned\" so that those sitting near the windows can switch off, or so individuals or small teams working late don't incur the costs of lighting the entire floor. \"Its just good housekeeping, but it can make a substantial difference,\" Fidell says. For additional savings, when lighting is replaced, go for small-diameter, high-frequency fluorescent tubes. Other well-documented responsible work practices include replacing old electronic equipment with Energy Star-rated devices and turning off machines that aren't in use. </p> <p>\"One of the quickest, cheapest and easiest fixes to power wastage is having the ability to regulate when machines are on and off,\" says Francis West, CEO at FWCS, a supplier of green money-saving IT solutions for small businesses. \"It's a myth that switching a device off and on uses more power,\" he says, pointing to recent research conducted for Fujitsu-Siemens, which shows that if a PC is switched off at 6pm or 7pm then on again at 8am a company could save \u00a3100 a year per PC, compared to leaving the systems on standby. \"And that was before recent increases in energy costs,\" West notes.</p> <p>\"For an organisation with 120 machines that's a saving of \u00a312,000 a year, equating to 53 new machines, new training, or a staff holiday \u2014 however you want to position it,\" he says. </p> <p>A rack of three servers draws the same power as 20 average households. Generating a lot of heat, these high-performing processors need to be cooled. While some servers, such as those running email, may need to stay on around the clock, this may not be the case for all of them. </p> <h2>Cost management</h2> <p>If businesses want to reduce energy costs further, they can also investigate switching supplier (see surviving recession, page 5, for advice on this). This won't make them greener, but it will continue to drive energy management in the right direction. Market analyst Datamonitor estimates that while energy suppliers may lose money on new business customers in the first year, by offering them great deals to encourage them to switch, they make 32% profit from them in the next by moving their rates. \"Only a small proportion of SMEs have ever switched energy supplier and we estimate that UK SMEs are overpaying by \u00a32bn each year,\" says Jonathan Elliott, MD of Make It Cheaper, a price comparison and switching service for SMEs. </p> <p>For FWCS's West, who practises green behaviour across his own business, it isn't just cost that drives his zeal for reducing wastage. His epiphany came when he saw Al Gore's documentary on global warming, An Inconvenient Truth. \"It rocked me to my foundation. You can't watch the film without getting a profound sense of our individual responsibility for preserving the planet for our children's children,\" he says.</p> <p>Being seen to be green is another important driver in changing businesses' behaviour. From legal firms to shops and hotels, organisations are keen to demonstrate their own social responsibility because it helps strengthen their brand. If their customers include public sector organisations or large businesses, the ability to demonstrate green credentials could be crucial to their ability to maintain key relationships, as these clients strive to meet their own sustainability targets.</p> <p>Tightening legislation is also heaping on the pressure to save the planet from within the workplace. By 2010, any business with an energy spend of \u00a3500,000 a year will have to participate in the government's compulsory carbon trading scheme, while the new energy performance certificates (EPCs) coming into effect this October will affect businesses of all sizes. Firms will face fines of up to \u00a35,000 if they fail to present a valid EPC when building, selling, leasing or modifying their premises. </p> <p>And from January, air-conditioning systems using 250kW and above will need to be surveyed. \"All of this helps drive awareness and focus the mind,\" says energyteam's Fidell. </p> <p>Without that awareness, change is hard to effect.</p>",
  "<p>As economic confidence has ebbed over the past week, there's a sense of an era drawing to a close. And with that comes a reckoning of what's been achieved and what opportunities have been missed. It's a conversation which looks back not forward: what we have done, what the Tories didn't do, rather than what we are going to do. It's a dangerous symptom of the fatalism which several fringe speakers such as the outspoken MP Fiona Mactaggart are warning against.</p> <p>But however dangerous the reckoning, it throws an interesting light on New Labour. The perspective of history is always, subtly and powerfully, different from the snap judgments of the day \u2013 it is the one, after all, which lasts.</p> <p>So into the balance go the much cited achievements in early years provision. Also winning credit are Labour's reforms on the constitution, praised by political historian David Marquand during the party conference as perhaps the most significant of any government in several centuries: devolution, the human rights act, directly elected mayors, some Lords reform. </p> <p>But set against these historic achievements comes the bitterness of opportunities missed. The one which is already haunting the Labour party is that they should have gone for <a href=\"http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/\">electoral reform</a> when they had the chance. If they had fulfilled their 1997 manifesto commitment, they could have truly transformed British political culture. But with the hubris of big majorities, they binned the commitment, complacently assuming they could carry on winning with first past the post. Now, as they stare crushing defeat in the face, they feel keenly the wisdom of their own argument in past years: that big majorities are not just bad for democracy \u2013 because they don't represent accurately the country's vote \u2013 but they are bad for the party, falsely bolstering a supremacy which can dramatically disintegrate.</p> <p>There is a strong inclination, as Peter Hain and Mactaggart suggested in Manchester, for a last minute dash. Get some measure of electoral reform \u2013 any type will do \u2013 in place now before it is too late. There is the sharp realisation that if Brown had gone to the country a year ago with a manifesto commitment to electoral reform, Labour could have been in power for another decade. The fear is that this is the missed chance which will loom over the years in opposition.</p> <p>Another equally powerful sense of missed opportunity in Brown's coinage of the phrase \"progressive consensus\" despite never managing to define it successfully, nor own this agenda. Now Labour sees this home territory subjected to baffling Tory inroads.</p> <p>\"Progressive\" is the word which both the Tories and Labour are now squabbling to define and own. It's not just a matter of rhetoric and semantics: it is a highly charged word in British politics, which has been used to distinguish the two parties for much of the last century. The left believed in progress, while the right was sceptical that such a thing was possible and believed that politics should have a more modest aim of continuing tradition and managing change.</p> <p>But Labour's faith in progress has faltered in the face of a global capitalism it only hopes to moderate, rather than transform. Its own utopian dreams of progress towards a socialist future have been abandoned. At the same time, the Conservatives under Thatcherism became a party of radical change \u2013 which some called progress.</p> <p>\"Progressive\" has become a \"Humpty Dumpty word\", as David Marquand put it to me during the conference: it means whatever you want it to mean. Empty of any real content, it's simply a word to claim superiority. It joins a dustbin of political terms like modernisation which have been overused, overextended and so badly exploited for political purposes that they no longer have meaning.</p> <p>The reason why this matters is that Labour has dreamed for several decades that power would enable it to embed social democracy so deeply into the country that it would be hard to reverse. What they wanted was permanent change, and what they are realising is that huge ambition was probably within their grasp at key moments through their past decade in power but it slipped between their fingers. The recriminations over why that happened will be fearsome.</p>",
  "<p>As another week in late modernity's troubled, deregulated global market begins anew, there will be many who will be hoping that governments here and in the US will continue to prop up this market, and an even greater number who will be wondering how all of this affects them. So too, there will no doubt be policy advisors \u2013 as was revealed most recently by a leaked Home Office document \u2013 trying to work out how this will affect law and order, as if to imply that rising crime inextricably follows an economic downturn.</p> <p>Some criminologists \u2013 most recently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/richardgarside\">Richard Garside</a> \u2013 have tried to explain how difficult it is to link the underlying economic situation with crime statistics, and have rightly described how inequality \u2013 the widening gap between the \"haves\" and the \"have-nots\" \u2013 is probably the best indicator of how criminogenic a society will be. However, there has been hardly anyone at all who has pointed out the most obvious criminological reality \u2013 namely, that we should see the crime explosion of the 1990s and beyond as the direct result of the neoliberal political economy and that the crime that we are currently experiencing stems from deregulation in the service of the needs of business. In short, it is not a question of how crime might rise in these circumstances, but rather how these circumstances have already created the crimes that blight our towns and cities.</p> <p>If ever proof were needed of the impact of the move from traditional forms of capital, community and politics to a globalised economy built on unstable labour markets and consumerism then Steve Hall, Simon Winlow and Craig Ancrum's extraordinary new book \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.willanpublishing.co.uk/cgi-bin/indexer?product=9781843922551\">Criminal Identities and Consumer Culture</a> \u2013 provides more than enough evidence. The book's basis is a long-term, ethnographic study of a range of contacts in the north-east of England.</p> <p>Taking as their starting point the idea that \"smart liberals\" have not controlled capitalism's \"nasty side\", they show how an expansion of consumption through credit has created a culture obsessed with material goods, and where competitive individualism \u2013 the \"me project\" \u2013 has emptied old, solid, working-class communities of value and meaning so that these have become places to escape from, rather than fight for and improve as a collective. In such communities they argue that \"crime is an instrument for achieving fantasised positions of social distinction and 'respect' in consumer culture\", and where as a result most of their respondents wanted to become \"stars\" of a criminal underworld as a means of gaining access to the material possessions that conferred status and meaning on their lives.</p> <p>What they have produced is essentially a bleak and sobering picture, but all the better for the honesty and theoretical inventiveness that they bring to their material. So too they offer a corrective for all the current and planned interventions that are propping up a market based on the fictitious world of finance capital, and which has created a \"post-needs, desire-driven\" society that has obliterated economic and social significance for vast swaths of our population, and left in its wake more crime than we have probably ever experienced in our history.</p>",

Palin and the Republican camp have already been <a href=\"http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2008_09/014549.php\">widely derided</a> for claiming the fact that her home state of Alaska is near Russia gives Palin experience in Russian affairs. </p> <p>No doubt she will be looking to arm herself with some more detailed insights into the complexity of the Caucasus region when she meets Saakashvilli, who will have the Ukrainian president, Viktor Yuschenko, alongside him. </p> <p>Then it is on to the Middle East and Asia, with meetings lined up with the Iraqi president, Jalal Talabani, the Pakistani president, Asif Ali Zardari, and Manmohan Singh, the Indian prime minister.</p> <p>Yesterday's meetings were hit by criticism over media access. The McCain campaign had tried to keep journalists out, initially insisting just a few photographers and one television camera could attend. </p> <p>This caused a furore among the press and the campaign team had to back down when CNN, the pool camera crew, <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/09/23/media-presses-mccain-campaign-for-access-to-palin-meeting/\">threatened to boycott</a> the whole event. </p> <p>Still, the <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/23/media-rebellion-over-palin-photo-ops/\">New York Times' political blog</a> mocked that all it could glean from her meeting with Karzai was that she thought the name of his young son, Mirwais, which means \"the light of the house\", was \"nice\".</p> <p>Gordon Brown is due to arrive in New York later today. But having caused ire among the Republican campaign for indicating that he <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2008/09/10/uk-prime-minister-brown-denies-obama-bias \">supported Barrack Obama's candidacy</a>, he is unlikely to get an audience. </p> <p>Palin's lineup is not just world leaders in suits. U2's frontman, Bono, will also be offering his thoughts on international relations to the pro-hunting anti-abortionist. </p> <p>Can she really learn much from these short meetings? And who else should be on Palin's must-see list for a thorough grounding in foreign affairs?</p>",
  "<p>Three British players have been included among the nominees for the International Rugby Board player of the year award. Wales captain Ryan Jones and his international colleague Shane Williams feature on a five-strong list, alongside Scotland scrum-half Mike Blair. </p> <p>The other two contenders are New Zealand's imperious fly-half Dan Carter, who will begin a lucrative six-month contract with French club Perpignan in December, and Italy skipper Sergio Parisse. The winner of what is viewed as rugby union's most prestigious individual award will be announced in London on November 23. </p> <p>Jones led Wales to their second Six Nations title and Grand Slam in four years last season, and is favourite for Lions captaincy duties in South Africa next summer. His Ospreys team-mate Williams, meanwhile, broke Gareth Thomas's Wales try-scoring record last term, and has scored 43 tries in 58 Test appearances. The diminutive wing is regarded as one of world rugby's most dangerous attackers, and has been identified in many quarters as the favourite for the IRB award.</p> <p>Scrum-half Blair skippered Scotland to Calcutta Cup glory against England at Murrayfield last March, while Carter took the IRB's top accolade in 2005. Carter guided New Zealand to this year's Tri-Nations title, underlining his status as the world's leading fly-half, and Parisse has led Italy under the coaching regime of Nick Mallett, establishing himself among the most consistent number eights in international rugby.</p> <p>\"The IRB player of the year award is the ultimate accolade for a player,\" said IRB chairman Bernard Lapasset. \"It takes into account performances in all the major internationals played during the year, including the Six Nations, Tri-Nations and the June-July Tests. The list of past winners of this coveted award is impressive, and reads like a who's who of the international game in recent years. Jonny Wilkinson, Schalk Burger, Richie McCaw, Fabien Galthie, Dan Carter, Bryan Habana and Keith Wood were all worthy recipients of the award, while Carter would be the first player to win twice should he be selected.\"</p> <p>The awards judges, a panel that includes John Eales, Gavin Hastings and Francois Pienaar, will also vote on the IRB's team and coach of the year. Lapasset added: \"Now that the shortlist has been selected, the panel will reconvene during the November Tests when the IRB player of the year will be selected.\"</p> <p>Elsewhere, South Africa are attempting to bring southern hemisphere rugby into line with the rest of the global game by taking a stand against Australia and New Zealand over Experimental Law Variations (ELVs). The South African Rugby Union wants to ensure the 2009 Tri-Nations and Super 14 competitions are played under the same laws as next summer's Test series against the British and Irish Lions.</p> <p>That means ditching the controversial 'sanctions regulation' - where most penalties are replaced by free-kicks - which was used in this year's SANZAR competitions but does not feature in the global ELV trial. Australia and New Zealand are supporters of the sanctions regulation and believe it makes rugby a better product for spectators. </p> <p>They were informed of South Africa's stance on the ELVs overnight and the matter will be discussed at the SANZAR executive committee meeting in Sydney on October 15. If no consensus can be reached, SARFU would be prepared to take the matter to arbitration. \"We will play the Springbok end of year tour matches under the global ELVs and, most importantly, we will play the British and Irish Lions under the global ELVs next year,\" said SARFU president Oregon Hoskins. \"For consistency's sake and to allow our Springboks the smoothest possible preparations for next year's crucial series against the Lions it is vital that we play under one set of laws.\"</p>",

Hu is serving three-and-a-half years in jail for \"inciting to subvert state power\". <br> \"The prize will go this year to a Chinese dissident and I believe the most likely [recipient] will be Hu Jia, perhaps together with his wife [Zeng Jinyan],\" said Stein Toennesson, director of the International Peace Research Institute in Oslo, and a close observer of the peace prize. \"He has become the most well known Chinese dissident now and it has been a very long time since anyone [related to China] has won the prize.\" The last occasion was the Dalai Lama in 1989.  Experts said the Norwegian Nobel committee, the secretive five-strong body that awards the prize yearly, would see the passing of the Olympic Games as an opportunity to highlight China's human rights record, especially in a year marking the 60th anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights.  \"There was a lot of repression during the Olympic Games. Now is a golden opportunity to underline that repression is unacceptable,\" said Janne Haaland Matlary, a professor of international relations at the University of Oslo, and a previous candidate to be a member of the Nobel committee.  Since the Tiananmen Square uprising in 1989, \"it has become more and more difficult to criticise China as it became more forceful and powerful,\" said Toennesson. \"It has also been an argument not to disturb the run-up to the Olympics because it will be of momentous importance not only for the regime, but also for the Chinese people.\" Some 164 invididuals and 33 organisations are nominated for this year's prize, including Bob Geldof, Vladimir Putin and the Esperanto language. The committee <a href=\"http://nobelprize.org/nomination/peace/\">does not publish the names of nominees</a> but those who can nominate, including parliamentarians, former laureates and academics, can choose to reveal their choices. <br> The committee could choose to honour Thich Quang Do, a Vietnamese Buddhist monk who has been fighting for religious freedom and democracy in the Communist nation. \"He has been a systematic opponent to the regime,\" said Toennesson.  The Chechen human rights lawyer Lydia Yusupova is another contender. \"It would be an opportunity to focus on Russia at a time of increased interest following the conflict with Georgia,\" said Matlary. Morgan Tsvangirai could be honoured \"because he has stuck to non-violent means to bring about regime change against Robert Mugabe,\" said Toennesson. But he added: \"It would be perhaps too risky to give it to him now that he is PM.\"  Another name mentioned is Ingrid Betancourt, who could be honoured for \"maintaining, despite her ordeal, that political transformation must happen through peaceful and democratic means\" in a country - Colombia - that is living through the world's longest running civil war. </p> <p>The committee could decide to name a journalist or media organisation. \"Good news coverage, as opposed to propaganda or inaccurate reports, can be essential to peace,\" the secretary of the Nobel committee, Professor Geir Lundestad, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2006/oct/07/uknews\">previously told the Guardian</a>. He mentioned possible contenders such as CNN, the New York Times, Le Monde or El Pais. </p> <p>Celebrity activists such as Bono and Geldof could be considered. \"Celebrities have been able to raise international awareness on issues such as Darfur and put pressure on China over its relationship with the Sudanese government,\" said Toennesson. </p> <p>The prize is announced in October each year, and the award ceremony takes place in December in Oslo. Last year's winners were <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2007/oct/12/climatechange.internationalnews\">Al Gore and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a>.</p>",

  "<p>Hilary Benn today defended the government's measures to help people with domestic fuel bills and pledged that the rising cost of oil would not derail its efforts to tackle climate change.<br> In his speech to Labour party conference, the environment secretary said he still believed the best way to reduce bills was through loft and cavity insulation rather than one-off payments.</p> <p>Benn also pledged that the government would work to increase its carbon dioxide emission targets. It is currently committed to a 60% reduction by 2050, but the minister now said he hoped the level would be raised to 80%. He also said that a million new \"green jobs\" would be created in a low-carbon British economy. </p> <p>Benn said that the high prices of oil and food were an indication of what could happen when Earth's resources were taken for granted. He said: \"Some people say: 'Can we afford to fight climate change when times are tough?'</p> <p>\"Yes, we can, and yes, we must. Because now - and in the years ahead - it won't be a choice between either fighting climate change or building a strong economy.</p> <p>\"A low-carbon Britain will be the strong economy of the future, making us less dependent on the oil and gas that's costing us the Earth.\"</p>",
  "<p>James Bidwell is to <a href=\"http://www.visitlondonmediacentre.com/press_releases/press_release/visit_london_ceo_to_take_new_role/\">step down</a> as chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.visitlondonmediacentre.com/home/\">Visit London</a>, the capital's tourism agency, at the end of this year and start a new job with the American lifestyle brand Anthropologie Europe. Is he leaving because he longs for a new challenge or because he's fed up? </p> <p>Visit London stoutly deny that Bidwell's departure after three years in the role is anything to do with its receiving a \"smaller than anticipated\" increase in funding from the London Development Agency this year following the Treasury's comprehensive spending review. Nonetheless, were I a top notch marketing wizard I think I'd find the current mood music ominous.</p> <p>In July, the LDA axed <a href=\"http://www.lda.gov.uk/server.php?show=conGlossary.122\">London Unlimited</a>, a \u00a35 million per annum body overseen by Bidwell and responsible for building London as a global brand. The LDA is not Visit London's only source of income \u2013 it has private sector funding streams too \u2013 but it does receive a tidy sum from them: \u00a316 million for 2008/09, representing about three-quarters of its annual budget. The current climate does not suggest this is likely to increase much during the Olympic build-up years. </p> <p>Throw in Mayor Johnson's rhetoric about value-for-money and LDA waste, and it is easy to imagine that moving to Anthropologie Europe might have been all the more appealing to Bidwell. </p>",
  "<p>It was another strange day in this ever more strange election campaign, with the focus split between New York and Washington, and the presidential candidates playing a decidedly marginal role. On Capitol Hill, treasury secretary Henry Paulson <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/24/wallstreet.georgebush\">continued to try to sell the Bush administration's bailout plan</a> to an angry Congress, whose members pressured him to toughen it up, while at the United Nations the president <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/24/georgebush.usa\">added lines on the economy to his speech</a>. He didn't get much of a reception: fewer than 10 seconds of polite applause - and a \"thumbs-down\" gesture from Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the president of Iran, whose own speech was a typically anti-Bush and anti-Israel affair. </p> <p>Barack Obama, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/24/uselections2008.barackobama\">engaged in intensive debate preparation in Florida</a>, surfaced to condemn Ahmadinejad's \"outrageous remarks\", and also Bush's \"my-way-or-the-highway intransigence\" on the bailout. John McCain, meanwhile, once again played second fiddle to his running-mate, Sarah Palin, who met the heads of state of Afghanistan and Colombia, and Henry Kissinger, in New York. </p> <p>The McCain/Palin campaign engaged in a brief spat with the written press, which it initially tried to exclude from covering her handshakes with the world leaders, before eventually relenting. But the next round in McCain's war with the media seemed likely to be far more vicious: late last night, the New York Times reported on its website that a firm owned by McCain's campaign manager, Rick Davis, had <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/24/us/politics/24davis.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin\">received payments of $15,000 a month until last month</a> from Freddie Mac, one of the mortgage giants implicated in the current economic crisis, in contradiction to the campaign's claims. </p> <h2>What to watch out for</h2> <p>McCain and Palin remain in New York today, while Obama is in Florida, preparing for Friday's debate, which is expected to receive the highest television audience for a political debate in history. Palin will meet Katie Couric, for an interview to be broadcast on tonight's CBS Evening News; despite her friendly exterior, Couric has been known to lob tough questions at her interviewees. </p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>Obama remains just ahead in most daily tracking polls: for example, <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/110608/Gallup-Daily-Obama-Holds-3Point-Edge.aspx\">Gallup has him at 47% to 44%</a>, down from 48% to 44% yesterday. A <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/23/AR2008092303667.html?hpid=topnews\">Washington Post/ABC poll puts Obama nine points ahead of McCain</a>, attributing his lead to turmoil in the financial industry (just 9% of those polled rate the US economy as good or excellent, the first time this figure has been in single digits since before the 1992 election). A new Pew poll meanwhile gives Obama a huge lead as the candidate voters consider best able to address the financial crisis: 47% to McCain's 35%. But a majority of those questioned backed the US government's bailout plan nonetheless. </p> <h2>On theguardian.com now</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/sep/24/johnmccain.republicans\">Tomasky Talk: War breaks out between McCain and the media</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/sep/23/uselections2008.useconomy\">Sasha Abramsky: Republican's can't distract attention from the economic crisis</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/24/energy.uselections2008\">Obama declares support for clean coal</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/24/uselections2008.johnmccain\">McCain drives into trouble over fleet of foreign cars</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselectionroadtrip/2008/sep/23/uselections2008\">Road trip blog: Washington's Orwellian wonderland</a></p> <h2>Best of the rest</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0908/13823.html\">Politico: Palin continues to dodge the media horde</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122221440058969313.html\">Thomas Franks: Judgement day for McCain</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/09/23/1436850.aspx\">MSNBC First Read: Cost of the bailout (in perspective)</a></p> <h2>Quote of the day</h2> <p>\"What is his name?\" </p> <p>\"Mirwais, which means 'The Light of the House'.\" </p> <p>\"Oh nice\" - the only recorded exchange between Sarah Palin and Afghanistan's Hamid Karzai at the UN yesterday.

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble:</strong> <br>It's Wednesday and both these problem children are full of woe. One of them will be spanked tonight and one will get the morale boost that comes with discovering that they are not, after all, the most hopeless kid on the block. But which will be which, readers, which will be which? Or is it to unfair to ask that question? After all, we can't rule out the possibility that both these laughable outfits will find a way to lose \u2026 </p> <p>Having won just four matches since their last Carling Cup game - the final last February - Juande Ramos's rabble are on a run so unconvincing that it long ago became a stagger. But though they remain significantly less than the sum of their parts and are playing about as coherently as swuivhyvajjfhtzzxatxzmmcycyoafn, at least Shambles B have a manager \u2013 unlike Shambles A, for whom the stand-in ringmaster tonight will again be Chris Hughton who, in fairness, does have a curious knack of being on the scene whenever Shambles B balls things up spectacularly. </p> <p><strong>Teams:</strong><br><strong>Shambles A:</strong> Given, Geremi, Taylor, Coloccini, Bassong, Cacapa, Butt, N'Zogbia, Owen, Duff, Martins. <br><strong>Subs:</strong> Harper, Xisco, Ameobi, Edgar, Tozer, Doninger, Donaldson.</p> <p><strong>Shambles B</strong>: Gomes, Zokora, King, Woodgate, Corluka, Lennon, Jenas, Assou-Ekotto, O'Hara, Bale, Pavlyuchenko. <br><strong>Subs:</strong> Cesar, Bentley, Bent, Gilberto, Modric, Giovani, Campbell.</p> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Chris Foy (<strong>whose claim to fame is that he once sent off Fulham mascot Billy the Badger for breakdancing too enthusiastically</strong>)</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>7:41pm:</strong> \"If the Spurs don't win tonight could this be the end of Comolli, Ramos, the whole lot?\" warbles George Templeton. It's highly unlikely that both would get the boot, George \u2013 and given how long they spent courting Ramos, how little time he has had in charge, how much compensation they would have to pay and how much they've misspent on Commoli's advice, my suspicion is the Frenchman would be first out.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>7:43pm:</strong> The number of conscientious objectors among the Toon Army is huge if the rows and rows of empty seats in St James' Park is anything to go by. \"I have been gazing at that Spurs team and wondering what shape it's going to play,\" confides Alan Cooper. \"How silly of me \u2013 they're obviously not going to have any shape.\"</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> Kick-off was taken by Newcastle ... successfully!</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> Colocconi nuts the ball clear an clatters into lone Shambles B striker Pavlyucnheno in the process, conceding a free-kick but escaping a booking. \"Would Levy - and Ramos for that matter - swap their first XI for Arsenal's Carling Cup Under 21s given the choice?\" squeals Elliot Jacobs, who obviously doesn't know what happened the last time the young Gunners</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> Bassong demonstrates how quickly he has immersed adapted to Newcastle by stroking the ball straight to an opponent in his own box. Lennenon is quickly crowded out by Basssong's team-mates, however.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> Jenas gets into a gallop for the first time, then slides a decent ball through to Pavlyuchenko, who decides to hit it first time from the right, about 25 yards out. His effort flew into the vacant seats behind the goal.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>10 min:</strong> Geremi floats a long free-kick towards the six-yard box, whereupon Taylor collides gently with Gomes, who collapses Dido-style and is now receiving treatment.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>12 min:</strong> Sky's commentator has just revealed that that there are rumours that Terry Venables could soon take chage at St James' Park, prompting co-commentator Brian Marwood to suggest \"they need someone of that elk\". Yes, he would certainly put the moose in order.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> This really is pedestrian stuff from both sides. There s nothing more to say. Except maybe this: \"I can't believe that you did not begin your coverage of this match with a preshamble \u2026,\" honks Steve Gaw.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>17 min:</strong> Duff attempts to scurry into the box but then turns back, as befits a man whose confidence has been in tatters for about three seasons. He ends up knocking the ball back to Butt, who hoofs an attempted cross miles over the bar. Ho, hum. \"Why is Zokora playing at right-back,\" storms Robin Lewis. He isn't, Corluka is at right-back, Zokora is one of the ineffective central midfielders.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>19 min:</strong> Bale swings in a free-kick from the left and Woodgate gets a toe to it, enough to prod it a mere 14 yards wide. Does that really have to go down as the game;s first shot?</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>21 min: </strong> Shambles A force a corner after the first bit of sustained pressure from either team in the match. King heads it clear but the home side quickly regain possession and recycle it to Nzogbia, who cuts in from the right and lashes a fine shot at Gomes, who holds it well.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>22 min:</strong> Butt chops down Bale to pick up his customary yellow card.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>25 min:</strong> Shambles B attempt to build some composure by stroking the ball around at the back. They were going nowhere until Jenas, possibly ashamed, simply whacked it forward to Given. yes, this game really is more scrappy than Scooby Doo's feisty young cousin.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>28 min:</strong> Coloccini performs a comical backheel in his own box, enabling Jenas to stretch and slip the ball to O'Hara ... whose poor first touch sends the ball out of play. \"With Duff and Butt on the Geordies, no wonder Newcastle's midfield if half-arsed,\" hardy-hars Corey Atkinson. So we've been reduced to this ...</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>30 min:</strong> Nope, still nothing.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>32 min:</strong> Gomes collects a loopy cross. \"They don't call him the octopus for nothing,\" chirps Sky's commentator, referring to the cephalopod that is, of course, renowned for its ability to catch footballs.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>33 min:</strong> Shambles B's first chance of the game! Pavlyuchenko escapes the attention of Coloccini with effortless ease and glances Jenas's corner just wide.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> Lennon attempts a cross. (Do I really need to add that it was wildly inaccurate?). \"This reminds me of when Gary Lineker said he preferred watching Wimbledon on Teletext,\" guffs Adam Levine. \"I'm a Spurs supporter and I think I'd rather have than a jalapeno high colonic than follow this current shower on MBM.\"</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>38 min:</strong> After flaccid attacking by Newcastle, Leenon busrts down the right and fires in a genuinely menacing cross ... insofar as it was straight at Coloccini and there's always a chance that a player in black and white will turn the ball into his own net. \"Scrappy was Scooby's nephew, not his cousin,\" barks Nathan Smith, exposing my lack of knowledge of crummy 1970s cartoon capers. \"Speaking of Scooby Doo, how is Shaggy Woodgate getting on at the heart of the Shambles B's comical defence?\" Well, if you wanted to be charitable you could say he's kept Michael Owen quiet. On the other hand, you could simply acknowledge that Shambles A's clueless build-up play has made that job extremely simple.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>40 min:</strong> Martins jinks into a dangerous position on the right but pulls his cross behind Owen. \"Given the rumours about El Tel, it was prescient of you to have put a photo of him at the top of the MBM,: hisses Ronan Hayes.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>42 min:</strong> Pavlyuchenko jumps for a header and flips his elbow into Coloccini's face, bloodying the Argentine's nose. I'd like to say it looked accidental ...</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>45 min:</strong> Zokora wins the ball in midfield and barges towards the box only to be dispossessed by Geremi. The Cameroonian bounds back up the other end and taps the ball sideways to Nzogbia, whereupon O'Hara sees the counter gathering steam and resolves to pull his opponent down, earning a yellow card. Geremi's free-kick from 40 yards almost bounces straight into the net as everyone stood and watched! Bu instead it went just wide. \"Regarding Tottenham's formation, surely it is pear-shaped?\" chortles Jason Averitt.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>Half-time:</strong> I'm not trying to be snide - the truth us I can't remember the last time I saw a match as bad as this. But I probably played in it. There has been next to nothing to suggest these are professional players, save a few dinky touches from Jenas, some raking balls by Geremi and lightning runs by Lennon that end with a whimper. I'm genuinely curious to see if things can possibly get worse in the second period. \"If either of these team's fans setup an alternative club to follow, like AFC Wimbledon and FC United, would they be called Babyshambles?\" guffaws Nathan Smith.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>Just to show I'm not exaggerating:</strong> Even Jeff Stelling on Sky has just said \"it's like the game is being played in slow motion ... let's just get straight to penalties?\" Which, of course, begs the question: has a penalty shoot-out ever ended 0-0? Stay tuned, folks, we would be about to witness history ...</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> Brace yourselves, the second half is under way ...</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> ACTION STATION! Nzogbia swung the ball in from the left, Martins flicked it on brilliantly to Duff, who took it in his stride and romped into the box before slipping the ball past Gomes ... but the retreating Woodgate slides in touch it out for a corner!</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> Coloccini has looked very shaky tonight and he's just committed another error, passing the ball to Bale before bolting forward to await the return pass! Bale failed to exploit this ineptitude, shooting well wide first time from 25 yards.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>52 min: </strong> Giovani is warming, sparking hopes of change.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>53 min:</strong> Giovani replaces Bale. Lennon will shift to the left.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>55 min:</strong> \"It's a frustrating match ... and if you've just got home after missing the first half - congratulations!\" booms Sky's commentator. Hyping this match up is an impossibility.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>57 min:</strong> Assou-Ekotto relieves the tedium with a barnstorming run down the left, then rewards himself with a fierce shot from 20 yards that Given spills. The keeper recovers just before Pavlyuchenko could pounce.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>59 min:</strong> After Pavlyuchenko fluffed a fine chance, the home team tore down the other end. Martins picked out Butt, who tapped a subtle bal through to Owen, who spun King brilliantly before firing at Gomes, who parried it behind for a corner. This game is actually improving!</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Shambles A 0-1 Shambles B (Pavlyuchenko 61')</strong></p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>61 min:</strong> Butt sloppily lost possession in the middle and the visitors worked the ball out to Lennon on the left. For once he looked up and flighted a fine ball into the centre, where Pavlyuchenko, with Coloccini and Bassong merely watching, headed past Given from seven yards.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>63 min:</strong> Threatening free-kick to Shambles A, on the rim of the opposing box ... Geremi'scurler is blocked by Woodgate.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Shambles A 0-2 Shambles B (O'Hara 66') </strong></p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> Good grief that was atrocious defending! 30 yards from their own goal, Coloccini rolled a slow ball across to Taylor, who attempted to thwart O'Hara's interception with a comical feint. It didn't work, of course, and O'Hara cantered through on goal to fire the ball past Given.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> Shambles B have gradually evolved into Spurs, a slightly fluid unit that is a class above the jokers in black and white. If this doesn't knock a few quid of Mike Ashley's asking price ...</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>71 min:</strong> Shambles A switch: Duff totters off to be replaced by Xisco. And Edgar comes on for Cacapa.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>73 min:</strong> With their confidence bolstered, Spurs are beginning to lord it over their hosts, who are reduced to chasing after the ball like panicky kids. \"It's great to see that the team formerly known as Newcastle Comedy Club can still defend so gloriously,\" gurgles Patrick Carr. \"And to do it without Titus Bramble - pure genius!\"</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>75 min:</strong> Spurs switch: Modric trots on in place of Pavlyuchenko.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>77 min:</strong> Nzogbia steals the ball in midfield and sprints forward. With Owen lurking to his left, the Frenchman elects to drive the ball 15 yards wide. \"Magpies?\" intones Gary Naylor. \"Aren't they the birds known for acquiring rubbish?\"</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>79 min:</strong> After a long period of misguided passes by both sides, Bassong races down the left and sends in a reasonable cross that is cut out by Woodgate.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>82 min:</strong> Gomes surges out of his box to get to a through-ball fractionally before Owen, and belt it to safety. \"Shambles A v Shambles B? You sir are a cad and a bounder,\" yells Jerry Thomas. \"Having said that, as a lifelong Spurs fan I'm expecting them to still balls this up.\"</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>84 min:</strong> Martins receives the ball i the box and outfoxes Corluka, who skids past him like an out-of-control car, but Woodgate is on hand to divert the ball out for a corner, which is wasted. \"Quick someone get that promising young Mexican player that Newcastle signed a few years agom\" roars Rodrigo Moya. \"You know, that one that got them into the Champions League by beating Liverpool in the last minute. Santiago Munez, I think it was. Oh wait, that was a movie. My bad. Still more enjoyable than this rubbish, mind.\"</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>87 min:</strong> Off-balance, Taylor shanks an O'Hara cross behind for a corner. The visitors take it short, then knock the ball around to waste time. The home side make a token effort at chasing them.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>89 min:</strong> The game's just petering out. \"What's the attendance at St James' Park tonight?\" asks Jason Keegan, who may or may not be related to you know who. In numerical terms, it's 19,743. In broader terms, it is sad proof that there are almost 20,000 people in the north-east who had nothing better to do tonight than feast on this swill.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Shambles A 1-2 Shambles B (Owen 90') </strong> Ok, maybe it's not petering out! Certainoly the visiting defenders thought so, as they completely switched off and allowed Geremi to jog down the right and put in a low cross. Gomes dived to palm it out, but only as far as Owen, who, from about 15 yards, slammed it high into the net.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>90+2 min:</strong> Free-kick to the home side, it's central and about 40 yards out. Geremi's delivery is dangerous, but O'Hara rises to nod it behind for a corner.

  "<p>Former TalkSport presenter James Whale has withdrawn his legal action over his controversial dismissal four months ago. </p> <p>Whale, who was fired from his late night phone-in after urging listeners to vote for Boris Johnson in the London mayoral election, said he did not have the funds to continue pursuing the unfair dismissal claim against the UTV-owned radio station. </p> <p>TalkSport management said Whale had breached broadcasting regulations and described the broadcast as a \"gross error of judgment\". </p> <p>Whale has always contested the dismissal but last night said he had decided not to continue with his legal action. </p> <p>\"I felt I deserved better than to be sacked, but the fact of the matter is that the legal system in this country precludes an individual taking on a big company. I have run out of funds and I just could not continue,\" Whale told MediaGuardian.co.uk. </p> <p>\"I have still got a lot of friends at TalkSport \u2026 and I think I have made my point. There is no point dwelling on it.\"</p> <p>Whale, who will join Global Radio's London talk station LBC as its new drivetime presenter in November, had worked for TalkSport and its previous incarnation, Talk Radio, for 13 years. </p> <p>He lodged two separate complaints at an unfair dismissal tribunal in Croydon and at London's high court.</p> <p>\"I was angry at the way I was treated by the company after all that time. I feel better now because I have got it out of my system,\" said Whale. </p> <p>\"I am going to continue with my new challenge which is to help make LBC London's most successful radio station. </p> <p>\"My wife and I have been under an enormous amount of strain over the past couple of months and we have decided to draw a line under it. </p> <p>\"I haven't benefited monetarily in any shape or form [as a result of the legal action]. I have got absolutely no money out of it.\" </p> <p>A spokesperson for UTV Radio said: \"We are pleased that all legal proceedings against TalkSport and UTV Radio have been withdrawn by James Whale and can confirm that no payment of any kind has been made.\"</p> <p>Whale had previously complained that he had still not had the opportunity to listen to the broadcast on March 20 after which he was fired. </p> <p>TalkSport dismissed him following an internal investigation. Media regulator Ofcom, which received a number of complaints following the programme, is yet to rule on the incident.</p> <p>The TalkSport programme director, Moz Dee, said at the Radio Festival in Glasgow in July that the decision was a \"very painful one, and made with regret\".</p> <p>TalkSport was censured by Ofcom last year after presenter George Galloway used his show to announce he would stand against a government minister at the next general election. </p> <p>The media regulator said TalkSport had broken the code on ensuring due impartiality, and said the breach was so serious that it had considered whether to impose a sanction on the station, which could have included a fine.</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p>Carbon trading will not solve the problem of soaring emissions from the aviation and shipping industries, a new analysis shows.</p> <p>Future carbon cuts must be so severe, that both sectors will have to curtail future growth to tackle global warming, according to research presented at a climate change conference at Exeter University today. </p> <p>Emissions from international aviation and shipping are growing rapidly, but are excluded from existing plans to cut carbon.</p> <p>Faced with growing pressure to act, experts are working to link them to carbon trading markets, such as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/emissionstrading\">European emissions trading scheme</a>. </p> <p>This would allow the aviation and shipping industries to buy carbon credits to cover their increased pollution, with the costs passed on.</p> <p>But Alice Bows, a climate scientist at the <a href=\"http://www.tyndall.ac.uk/\">Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research</a> at Manchester University, said future carbon cuts needed to be so severe that both sectors would have to reduce their own emissions as well.</p> <p>Bows said: \"They can't trade their way out of this problem. At current rates of growth, they will be consuming a significant proportion of the world's carbon budget by 2050. It will be way more than their fair share and an amount that simply can't be traded away because everybody else will have been forced to cut emissions.\" </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/01/climatechange.scienceofclimatechange2\">Scientists say</a> that unless soaring greenhouse gas emissions are curbed immediately, carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are on track to pass 650 parts-per-million (ppm), which could bring an average global temperature rise of 4C. </p> <p>According to the government's Stern review on the economics of climate change in 2006, this would mean that between 7 million and 300 million more people would be affected by coastal flooding each year, there would be a 30-50% reduction in water availability in southern Africa and the Mediterranean, agricultural yields would decline 15-35% in Africa and 20-50% of animal and plant species would face extinction.</p> <p>Earlier this year, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/feb/13/climatechange.pollution\">a leaked UN study</a> seen by the Guardian revealed that the true scale of climate change emissions from shipping was almost three times higher than previously believed.</p> <p>It calculated that annual emissions from the world's merchant fleet had already reached 1.12bn tonnes of CO\u2082, or nearly 4.5% of all global emissions of the main greenhouse gas.</p> <p>The report suggested that shipping emissions would become one of the largest single sources of manmade CO\u2082after cars, housing, agriculture and industry. By comparison, the aviation industry, which has been under heavy pressure to clean up, is responsible for about 650m tonnes of CO\u2082emissions a year, just over half that from shipping.</p>",
  "<p>The past two weeks of deepening financial turmoil have left mainland Europe on the sidelines. </p> <p>The gigantic bailouts of Wall Street institutions, the socialisation of vast tracts of the US economy and enforced US and British banking mergers have, in eurozone eyes, passed Europe by but rendered the dominant Anglo-Saxon economic model of the past quarter of a century kaput.</p> <p>The protagonists of modern Rhineland capitalism, Germany's centre-right chancellor, Angela Merkel, and her Social Democrat finance minister, Peer Steinbrueck, have delivered the same message.</p> <p>We warned the US and UK about the need to rein in runaway finance capital with greater regulation and transparency, they said, but were ignored.</p> <p>They and other leading eurozone players are refusing to take part in Washington's $700bn plan to acquire banks' toxic assets.</p> <p>It's not that continental Europeans feel immune from the fear and greed of Wall Street, or that they think the knock-on effects of the financial crisis on the real economy will be mitigated here, where every indicator points towards recession. </p> <p>And it's not that they believe individual banks won't be hit \u2013 think IKB/Sachsen LB in Germany and, above all, UBS in Switzerland.</p> <p>It's more that they feel their more tightly regulated, more consensus-driven economic model, derided by neo-liberals as sclerotic, yet recently reinvented, has been vindicated. </p> <p>Re-regulation and no more deregulation is the war cry - and MEPs this week voted by 562 to 86, with 25 abstentions, in favour of proposals for tougher oversight of and greater transparency among all financial players, including hedge funds and private equity firms.</p> <p>This is part of a wider European rethink of financial market regulation, which has been under way since the sub-prime crisis erupted and EU finance ministers adopted a regulatory \"roadmap\" last October.</p> <p>Nicolas Sarkozy, the French and current EU president, would like the adoption of a specifically pan-European system of cross-border supervision of banks and other financial players such as insurance groups. </p> <p>Christian Noyer, the Bank of France governor, favours giving a prime role to the European central bank.</p> <p>That's a sentiment echoed by centre-right MEPs such as the German Christian Democrat, Kurt Lauk, who says: \"The ongoing crisis of the banking sector shows that we can no longer rely on US standards, particularly since the American control systems failed substantially.\"</p> <p>In the next few weeks, Charlie McCreevy, the EU internal market commissioner and reluctant regulator, will set out European commission plans to revise the capital requirement directive, designed to improve the management of large-scale exposures, and to regulate credit rating agencies. </p> <p>He will also demand the speedier adoption of revised rules on how much capital reserves insurers should hold (Solvency II).</p> <p>There are three striking aspects to his proposals. Firstly, they rarely, if ever, get mentioned in the debate among British policymakers about how to respond to the crisis. </p> <p>In recent days, I have heard government ministers and opposition spokesmen such as the shadow chancellor, George Osborne, put them forward as their own, wilfully ignoring the longstanding EU dimension.</p> <p>Secondly, despite the scale of the majority vote in the European parliament, there is, in fact, no European consensus on how to proceed both in tackling the current crisis and laying down the regulatory framework for preventing future shocks. Lots of hue and cry, but no deal so far.</p> <p>Rating agencies have skilfully and intensely lobbied to expose gaps and inconsistencies in McCreevy's draft proposals. </p> <p>Big and small countries are at loggerheads over who should regulate the four dozen or so cross-border banking groups - the \"home\" regulator or the \"host\" supervisor. </p> <p>McCreevy sees hedge funds, private equity firms and sovereign wealth funds as saviours in Europe's recovery, but his political opponents want them savagely brought to heel (the funds are sanguine that they've taken the bite out of his plans).</p> <p>Thirdly, despite their schadenfreude about the woes of unbridled Anglo-Saxon capitalism, continental EU political leaders know that there will be no remedy without the Americans and the Brits (not forgetting the Asians).</p> <p>Any new regulatory system will have to meet global standards. A standalone EU system could simply lead to a flight of capital; Europe does not have the political or financial clout, let alone unity of purpose, to impose its will.</p> <p>So Sarkozy is proposing an emergency G8 meeting this autumn/winter to get a global deal - after the Europeans, probably, have floundered at their mid-October summit and the US has chosen a new president. It's an admission that even a weakened US still calls a lot of the shots.</p> <p><strong>Old habits die hard in the Rhineland</strong></p> <p>Rhineland capitalism may have been modernised through the euro and globalisation, but old habits die hard. </p> <p>This week, Merkel went to Wolfsburg, Volkswagen's home turf, and was greeted with roars of approval by more than 15,000 employees as though she was a union leader on the warpath.</p> <p>Accompanied by Bernd Osterloh, the works council leader and VW board member, and Felix Magath, the coach of the local Bundesliga football team, she reaffirmed the validity of the 1960 \"VW law\" that hands a blocking 20% minority vote to the state (Lower Saxony in this case) \u2013 and effectively told McCreevy (and Europe's highest court) where to get off.</p> <p>It's the latest act in the Wagnerian epic pitching Germany versus the EU - and, above all, Volkswagen against Porsche. </p> <p>The sports car maker Porsche owns just over 35% of VW (via ultra-modern financial transactions excoriated elsewhere by Merkel) and plans to take its much bigger partner/rival over by year end.</p> <p>The power play machinations around this takeover have seen the Porsche and Piech families that control Porsche in open warfare, with Wolfgang Porsche, the company's chairman, publicly denouncing Ferdinand Piech, VW's chairman and a big Porsche shareholder.</p> <p>Osterloh has taken Wendelin Wiedeking, Porsche's chief executive, to court over the latter's plans to cut the VW unions' seats on the merged group's supervisory board. Osterloh backs the VW law, but Wiedeking wants the EU to lay it to rest.</p> <p>Beyond the clashing of gigantic egos and political manoeuvrings, there is a simple fact: as Europe's largest carmaker, VW should be like any other modern listed European firm in an open ownership structure. </p> <p>But, for Merkel, the postwar German economic model is unassailable: \"This is about securing the future shape of Germany. And we need motivated workers for Project Germany.\"</p>",

  "<p>Lance Armstrong has confirmed that he will return to professional cycling in Australia next year and attempt to win an eighth Tour de France next summer, four years on from his last victory.</p> <p>\"I have decided to race my bicycle again,\" confirmed testicular cancer survivor Armstrong as he launched the 'Live Strong Global Awareness Campaign' in New York. \"With this campaign we feel that by racing the bicycle all over the world, beginning in Australia, ending in France at the global summit, it is the best way to promote this initiative, it's the best way to get the word out.\" </p> <p>Armstrong's thunder had been stolen by a politician earlier in the day when South Australia state premier Mike Rann revealed that Armstrong would be coming out of retirement at the Tour Down Under in January. And speaking at former US president Bill Clinton's philanthropic summit, the Clinton Global Initiative, Armstrong confirmed his plans to return to the saddle next year.</p> <p>\"I look forward to 2009, I look forward to racing again,\" said Armstrong, who plans to raise cancer awareness in Paris after the 2009 Tour de France. \"I cannot guarantee an eighth Tour victory, but I can guarantee you the 'Live Strong' message will touch all aspects of our society. It's not very often someone gets a chance to spend three or fours years away from something, step back, and then say to themselves, 'I sort of miss that, I'd like to go back and do that again,'\" he added. </p> <p>According to the Kazakh Cycling Federation, Armstrong, whose sole involvement in competitive cycling of late has been two long-distance mountain-bike races this year, is expected to join Team Astana, who were thrown out of last year's Tour de France after Alexander Vinokourov tested positive for a blood transfusion. Armstrong is close friends with Team Astana's team leader, John Bruyneel, who was his team director for all of his Tour de France victories with the US Postal and Discovery Teams. \"He is coming to Team Astana, he's doing it only so he can continue to win,\" the federation's deputy chief, Nikolai Proskurin told the Associated Press earlier today. </p> <p>Despite his lengthy absence from the sport Armstrong, 37, has been strongly backed to claim an eighth Tour win by figures from within the sport. \"He genuinely could win the Tour de France,\" said Pat McQuaid, the International Cycling Union president. \"But I don't think his primary motivation is to win the Tour de France. I think he has done as much as he can with his cancer foundation in terms of knowledge of it in the US and now he wants to globalise the foundation using the sport of cycling. Winning the Tour is secondary but I think he has every intention of trying to do it.\"</p> <p>Armstrong has also admitted that at least part of his motivation to compete in the Tour again is in order dispel the doping allegations that surrounded his first victory in 1999. In 2006, an independent investigator appointed by the ICU cleared Armstrong of any wrongdoing in his first Tour win and McQuaid believes the doubters are misguided.</p> <p>\"To all sceptics I would say 'give him a chance'. I don't believe he's a cheat,\" said McQuaid. \"He will be outlining his testing plans, all of which will be run by independent groups and totally transparent. He will be racing under the same conditions as everyone else. He must already be in the system for several months and he has already been tested out of competition for the last couple of months and that will continue throughout the season.\"</p>",

  "<p>The environment movement has been catapulted into the heart of UK politics over the last 3 years. It's obvious that many more people are aware of and care about climate change and environment issues than ever before. To his credit, David Cameron and his \"<a href=\"http://www.conservatives.com/tile.do?def=news.story.page&amp;obj_id=129231\">Vote Blue, Go Green</a>\" mantra has helped to make environmentalism politically mainstream. For all the political parties, robust environment policies are now essential for electoral success.</p> <p>This shift isn't unique to the UK. Throughout the world we are seeing the growing clout of environment groups in political debates. If we are to deal with the plethora of human-created problems that are destroying our planet, this shift is both positive and essential.</p> <p>There are a number of barriers, however, created by government and green groups, that could undermine this progress. Just as millions of people are becoming aware of the great threats to our environment, they are being frustrated by messy policies and priest-like environmentalists.</p> <p>If we don't get our act together and make environmentalism more relevant to everyday life, the population at large will stop listening. In the UK, there are a number of reasons why people could quickly become fed up with aspects of environmentalism.</p> <p>Firstly, taxes which have little to do with protecting the environment have been spun as \"green taxes\" by the government in an attempt to make them seem more palatable to the public. This strategy has backfired. Green taxes together cost the average household <a href=\"http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=152\">\u00a31,417 a year</a> and public impressions are negative. According to a <a href=\"http://www.yougov.com/uk/archives/pdf/STI070101003_1.pdf\">YouGov/Sunday Times poll (pdf)</a> from March last year, 63% of respondents believed that global warming was just an excuse to raise taxes further.</p> <p>Secondly, some environment policies, such as subsidies for first generation biofuels, have been proven to be counterproductive and excessively expensive (see the Policy Exchange paper, <a href=\"http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/images/libimages/419.pdf\"> The Root of the Matter(pdf)</a>), shortly after they were touted as a solution. This has broken down public trust in the politicians and environmentalists that advocated them.</p> <p>Thirdly, on almost everything from emission reductions to biodiversity conservation, the government's green targets have comprehensively failed (see the Policy Exchange paper <a href=\"http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/images/libimages/383.pdf\"> </a>Green Dreams (pdf)). This is because targets are set without considering the policies needed to implement them, are so vague as to be largely pointless or failing that, are chopped and changed when they are unlikely to be met.</p> <p>Lastly, measures that are said to help the environment are made difficult and time-consuming by government. Take recycling, the options available for sorting our waste for recycling and disposal differ hugely between local authorities and the recycling of items like <a href=\"http://www.arenanetwork.org/publications/Files/LTCS.pdf\">glass (pdf)</a> actually uses more energy than it saves. This lack of clarity and simplicity, which is by no means confined to recycling, makes doing the right thing difficult, when it should be easy. People do want to help save the planet, but they need to be empowered to do so, not frustrated and hindered.</p> <p>Given these obvious failures, what could be the options for restoring trust in environmentalism and making it more relevant to the individual?</p> <p>One of the most important things to demonstrate is that policies actually protect our environment cheaply and effectively. Being transparent about the costs associated with particular policies is essential. For example, the vast majority of people don't know what the cheapest ways of reducing greenhouse emissions are. If they did, they might wish to prioritise expenditure on the cheapest methods or use some abatement options and not others. The public debate on this has been mute, primarily because government and many green groups are not willing to be transparent about the options available and their respective costs and benefits.</p> <p>By far the most important thing, however, is to empower people to choose environmentally sound options and relate their individual actions to the bigger environmental picture of say, climate change and biodiversity conservation. As a country, the UK does this particularly badly. The important choices people make every day concerning transport, waste disposal, recycling, what to buy, and energy usage, are often not \"green\" because the greenest option is difficult or impossible to choose. Government needs to seriously think about to how make the greenest options the cheapest and easiest.</p> <p>The environment movement is at a crucial juncture, where global awareness of environmental threats is extremely high. Yet, that movement has so far failed to reach the heights of transparency and relevance needed to keep the struggle to protect our planet continually vivid in people's minds and central to our way of life. Environmentalism now needs to take into account of people's legitimate concerns about cost and propose cost-effective solutions to the problems we face. It must also help to make the greenest options in everyday life the easiest to choose.</p>",
  "<p>The global financial system is in chaos. Again. This time the epicentre is <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/news/specials/crisiswallstreet/2008/index.html\">America</a>.</p> <p>In 1948, the International Monetary Fund was established to maintain the stability of the international financial stability. Before then, major international financial crises occurred quite regularly every 50 years. Since 1980, we have faced wave after wave of crises, across Africa, Latin America, east Asia \u2013 and now the US.</p> <p>What has gone wrong? It's partly about financial markets getting out of control. But how have they got so far out of control, when we have an international agency to make sure they don't?</p> <p>The answer is not economic but political. Developed country governments, which represent 15% of the world population, have 60% of the votes in the IMF. And they run it in their own (unenlightened, short-term) self-interest. What could the IMF do to ward off the US financial crisis when the US government has one-sixth of the votes \u2013 enough to veto any major policy decision?</p> <p>But this is the least of the IMF's failures. It is generally recognised that its response to the <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/External/np/exr/facts/asia.htm\">1997 Asian crisis</a> was deeply flawed. Its \"solution\" to Latin America's 1980s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_American_debt_crisis\">debt problems</a> left countries seriously vulnerable to contagion from the Asian crisis. Worst of all, it has dragged out the response to the 1980s debt problems of low-income countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, over decades. Many countries' debts are still unsustainable. African poverty remains as widespread and severe as it was in 1981.</p> <p>In the American financial crisis, people have lost their homes. In the African crisis, they lost their lives. Millions of them. And people are still losing their lives 26 years later.</p> <p>In 1981, Nobel laureate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/31/society.politics\">Amartya Sen</a> highlighted the central role of democracy in preventing famines, by making it impossible for governments to ignore its victims. The last 26 years have shown that exactly the same applies at the global level.</p> <p>When an institution is run by the rich, it serves their interests, regardless of the needs of the poor. If the US looked like facing even a small fraction of the human toll of the African crisis, the IMF would undoubtedly take decisive and very different action. That's because the US, whose 300 million people are largely unaware of the fund's existence, has 16.8% of the votes. The 41 low- and lower-middle-income countries of Africa have 732 million people. Their economies have been virtually run by the IMF for more than a generation. But they have just 3.6% of the votes. So their problems are neglected.</p> <p>The IMF was powerless to prevent the current crisis because the US was too powerful. It has mishandled developing country crises, at considerable human cost, because they are too weak. If we really want a stable international financial system \u2013 and if we are remotely serious about global poverty \u2013 it is time to democratise the IMF. Now. And the only obstacle is the hypocrisy of developed country governments in using their privileged position to preserve an anti-democratic voting system which they would be the first to condemn in any other context.</p>",
  "<p>The future can be worrying to consider at the best of times. But with a global economic crisis looming, a war on terrorism and the continuing threat of climate change to ponder, the future looks bleak indeed. It's at times like these that people seek escape in the pages of popular fiction. But anyone looking for a better future in science fiction is in for a shock. </p> <p>Back in the golden age of science fiction, the future was a much brighter place. Pulp magazines gave readers amazing stories of flying cars, towering skyscrapers and the utopian metropolis. Legendary writers like Arthur C Clarke and Isaac Asimov predicted a future where science took mankind to the stars and beyond. And all this in the face of the Great Depression, two world wars and the constant threat of nuclear annihilation. There was no lack of reason for people then to be very gloomy indeed about the future, but maybe because the times were dark, readers flocked to the visions of a brighter future offered by science fiction. </p> <p>But for all its sense of wonder, golden age science fiction was guilty of a peculiar naivety in its depiction of the future. In its wake the character of the genre changed radically. The new wave movement, lead by writers like J G Ballard, Michael Moorcock and Harlan Ellison, reacted against the pulp roots of the genre, writing science fiction that drew heavily on literary technique and values. Writers from Ursula K Le Guin to Octavia Butler saw the potential of science fiction for expression, but rejected the overwhelmingly white, male perspective that dominated the genre. Bruce Sterling, William Gibson and other cyberpunk authors imagined futures so dark that even the human soul could be destroyed. Science fiction evolved into a sophisticated literature of ideas, offering dark warnings of the future to come.</p> <p>The best science fiction, as with all great art, doesn't just reflect the world but seeks to influence it. The dark warnings of science fiction have had innumerable, immeasurable effects on the world. The darkest and greatest of all, George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, ranks among the most influential works of literature ever written. How many more totalitarian states would persist today if Nineteen Eighty-Four had not warned generations against the threat they represented, both abroad and at home? The world needs warnings from its future, and science fiction has been there to provide them. </p> <p>But there are no end of reasons to have hope for tomorrow. Biotechnology and genetic research offer fantastic advances in medicine, yet their portrayal in science fiction is typified by the gloom of Margaret Atwood's Oryx and Crake. The internet is already democratising many new areas of society, but our political future is still most commonly depicted as one flavour of Big Brother dystopia or another. Environmental or economic collapse might plunge us all headlong into the apocalypic future of Cormac McCarthy's The Road, or we might respond to them with intelligence and ingenuity and take the opportunity to find better ways of living. To look at the infinite possibilities of the future and see only darkness is a failure of imagination.</p> <p>The challenge for writers of science fiction today is not to repeat the same dire warnings we have all already heard, or to replicate the naive visions of the genres golden age, but to create visions of the future people can believe in. Perhaps the next Nineteen Eighty-Four, instead of confronting us with our worst fear, will find the imagination to show us our greatest hope.</p>",
