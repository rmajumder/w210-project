  "<p>Chris White is a nice guy and a fine referee, which is why I hope I can talk about one of his recent games without anyone taking offence. He's respected. As a former player and official with more than 40 internationals behind him, he has a good understanding of the game and what players are trying to do, legally or illegally.</p> <p>His inclination is to be sympathetic and his reputation is that of a referee who lets games flow where possible.</p> <p>Last week, however, he whistled 35 times in one match - Northampton v Wasps. As close as makes no difference, that's one stoppage every two minutes, whereas last season he would probably have blown up about 19 times.</p> <p>About the same time, two other respected rugby men - the coaches Dean Richards of Harlequins and Dean Ryan of Gloucester - were getting stuck into each other at Kingsholm. Richards - Harlequins just having lost their unbeaten record - cried foul suggesting that Ryan had leaned on the referee <br>Rob Debney at half-time to such an extent that Gloucester - well behind on penalty count as well as the scoreboard - played the second 40 minutes without being penalised.</p> <p>Ryan denied haranguing the referee, insisting that he was merely seeking clarity around the tackle and ruck areas, and Richards' insistence that he'd given up talking to referees, because it was now forbidden, came unstuck when Debney said he'd been spoken to by both coaches during his walk from the pitch to the changing room. Both, said Debney, were polite but that's not the point. Referees and touch judges should be left alone. But then again, I can understand why such things happen.</p> <p>It's a cliche to say that you don't notice good referees, but it's true. In the past, guys like Chris White have been at the heart of good games without outwardly appearing to influence them. Now they don't get the chance of blending into the background. Like it or lump it, the referee too often becomes the focus of the game because the rule makers have taken away the licence to interpret the rules.</p> <p>Alongside the introduction of the 13 'experimental laws' came the 'protocols' which replaced interpretation with instruction. These have been reinforced with two- or three-hour conference calls instructing referees what they must do.</p> <p>The result: 35 penalties in one match. I sense that's not the way most referees want it to be and have a feeling that we are shooting ourselves in the foot. By common consent, the Guinness Premiership appeared to have got it right last season and crowd figures reflected this.</p> <p>I also had a lot of good feedback, the most satisfying from rugby league friends who liked what union was doing and said so. This season, with so much kicking, so much stop-start and lack of continuity, I don't know.</p> <p>Part of what appealed to those league guys was the pressure that built with the phases of play. Now, with referees so hot on the whistle, repeatedly taking the ball into contact has become a big risk - too big a risk when it comes to running the ball out of defence. It's easier to use the boot, play aerial ping-pong if you like, move up the field, wait for mistakes or only attack from well within opposition territory.</p> <p>What that means to potential converts to union I'm still to find out, but some coaches already detect a fall in attendances.</p> <p>It may be that fans are short of money like everyone else, but any dip in gates will obviously be part of the agenda when the new laws and their workings, are reviewed by club coaches in a couple of weeks. </p> <p>However, in the gloom there is a flicker of light. Alarmed at having to chop and change ahead of the Lions' tour next year, South Africa want to drop those Experimental Law Variations not being implemented here which make most offences punishable by free kicks rather than penalties while punishing the side that takes the ball into a ruck or maul but then fails to clear it.</p> <p>Understandably, players, fans and even referees are said to be confused at having to switch for Tests against northern hemisphere sides.</p> <p>These laws have been used in the Tri-Nations and Super 14, with Australia and New Zealand pushing for them to be part of the global game, but with South Africa wanting to rejoin the rest of the rugby-playing world it seems the worst excesses of change will go away and that northern hemisphere rugby - and referees - will be spared further.</p>",
  "<p>GM crops are already helping over 12m farmers around the world by delivering more consistent yields of higher-quality crops (Letters, September 25). About nine out of 10 of these are resource-poor growers with small plots of land, whose lives can be significantly improved through GM technology. Besides improving productivity, GM crops can help alleviate pressure on land and water resources, and hence offer a more reliable source of food and income.</p> <p>GM crops grown over the past 12 years on over 1bn acres have been found to increase yields in practice, compared with conventional crops. According to a European commission study in June, Spanish farmers adopting GM maize experienced higher average yields than conventional maize growers over the three-year study period. Further, GM technology is safe. In fact, in the last decade, more than 200bn meals containing GM ingredients have been consumed, without a single substantiated example of harm to health. And in complete contrast to your correspondents' wild allegations, the commission's Joint Research Centre has also completed an extensive review, concluding that GM foods cause no harm. It is wrong that activists should continue to mislead the public.</p> <p>Farmers in the UK and worldwide know the crop characteristics that are most desirable for their productivity, the environment and their customers. They should be granted the choice to grow GM crops, if they wish. Ironically, as Friends of the Earth rightly points out, local food needs must be met by \"combining science and technology with communities' traditional knowledge\". This must include agricultural biotechnology.<br><strong>Julian Little</strong><br>Chair, Agricultural Biotechnology Council</p>",
  "<p>Robert Mugabe cast himself into the glare of media attention at the UN general assembly in New York yesterday, taking the opportunity to lash out at Britain and America, which he accused of inflicting untold suffering on the people of Zimbabwe.</p> <p>The president of Zimbabwe was centre stage at the UN building when his turn came round to deliberate before the assembly about the state of the world through his eyes. He did not refer to the elections and the violence his regime unleashed against the opposition led by Morgan Tsvangirai until their power-sharing deal, choosing instead to focus on the food crisis which he blamed on western sanctions.</p> <p>\"Those who falsely accuse us of these violations are themselves international perpetrators of genocide, acts of aggression and mass destruction,\" he said.</p> <p>He appealed to the assembly floor, which was notable for the absence of any US delegation, to \"apply pressure for the immediate removal of these sanctions by Britain, the United States and their allies, which have brought untold suffering to our people\".</p> <p>Mugabe also blamed global warming for the widespread scarcity of food in his country. Droughts and floods over the past seven years had disrupted the food supply, he said, implicitly rejecting the widespread view that it stems from the economic disruption that followed his state seizure of large farms owned by whites, and the crippling inflation rate of at least 11m% and rising.</p> <p>In an interview with Associated Press in advance of his UN address, Mugabe further taunted the British and US governments. \"They are waiting for a day when this man, this evil man, called Robert Mugabe is no longer in control. And I don't know when that day is coming.\"</p> <p>He said he had no thoughts of resigning. Nor \"any thought of dying\".</p>",
  "<p>John McCain was accused last night of sabotaging the Wall Street bail-out with theatrics that reduced America's credit crisis to a showcase for his presidential leadership capabilities.</p> <p>The furious words for the Republican candidate came after a contentious meeting at the White House between George Bush and congressional leaders scuppered an early deal on a $700bn rescue package. Both McCain and Barack Obama attended the meeting.</p> <p>The extraordinary session had been called after McCain's stunning announcement on Wednesday that he would suspend his campaign and would seek a delay in tonight's presidential debate to try to personally help steer through a deal on the bail-out. By midday yesterday, congressional leaders said they had reached the outlines of a deal.</p> <p>But that optimism appeared to have dissipated after the White House meeting.</p> <p>Democrats and Republicans said that prospects for a deal vanished after McCain had tried to prod his fellow Republicans in another direction. The breakdown cast new uncertainty over Friday night's presidential debate in Mississippi, as well as the future of the bail-out itself.</p> <p>McCain told ABC television last night that members of Congress still had legitimate concerns about the bill. But he added that he remained \"hopeful\" of a deal that would allow him to go ahead as planned with the debate.</p> <p>Obama had said earlier he would attend the debate, and the University of Mississippi, which is hosting the event, said it intended to go ahead.</p> <p>But both candidates planned to spend the night in Washington, where the last-minute uncertainty about the bail-out saw Democrats erupting in fury at McCain. Democratic leaders accused the Republican of engineering the drama to distract from his recent dip in the polls.</p> <p>\"What this looked like to me was a rescue plan for John McCain,\" Christopher Dodd, who heads the Senate's banking committee, told CNN.</p> <p>Obama also chided McCain. \"When you start injecting presidential politics into delicate negotiations you actually start creating more problems,\" he said.</p> <p>The attacks appeared to be a strategy to block McCain's efforts to cast himself as above the political fray when it came to America's credit crisis. McCain has depicted the bail-out negotiations as a crisis requiring his personal attention.</p> <p>\"I'm an old navy pilot, and I know when a crisis calls for all hands on deck,\" he said in a speech to the Clinton Global Initiative in New York, before travelling to Washington. \"As of this morning, I suspended my campaign. With so much on the line, for America and the world, the debate that matters most right now is taking place in the United States Capitol - and I intend to join it.\"</p> <p>Obama continued to reject McCain's argument that the gravity of America's financial crisis should put the campaign on hold. \"Our election is in 40 days,\" he said in his speech to the Clinton initiative, delivered from Florida where he was preparing for the debate. \"The American people deserve to hear directly from myself and Senator McCain about how we intend to lead our country. The times are too serious to put our campaign on hold, or to ignore the full range of issues that the next president will face.\"</p> <p>However, McCain did not even arrive in Washington until after Democratic and Republican leaders announced they had the outlines of a rescue package. He admitted as recently as Tuesday he had not taken the time to even read the plan, according to an NBC transcript distributed by the Obama camp.</p> <p>But that did not stop the Republican from seizing the headlines for two days in a row. McCain first wrong-footed Obama on Wednesday with his stunning announcement he would suspend his campaign and would not attend the debate.</p> <p>Yesterday, he struck again, appropriating Obama's conditions for the rescue deal - barely 24 hours after rejecting them. The Democrat proposed the conditions in discussions with McCain on Wednesday about a joint statement on the crisis.</p> <p>The Obama camp had called for an independent oversight board, a mechanism to protect taxpayers, a curb on outsized payments to Wall Street executives, and relief for homeowners faced with losing homes. The proposed joint statement also rejected attaching other measures, or earmarks, to the bill. In his speech yesterday McCain adopted near identical language - as well as the essence of four of the measures: an oversight board, protection for taxpayers, controls on Wall Street executives and a ban on earmarks; he made no mention of relief for homeowners.</p> <p>McCain's urgency for reaching a deal comes after polls suggested the economic crisis was eroding Republican support.</p>",
  "<p>Ireland has become the first country in the eurozone to slip into recession, official figures showed yesterday.</p> <p>The Central Statistics Office said the once-booming economy shrank 0.3% in the first quarter and by 0.5% in the second - a recession is two or more consecutive quarters of contraction. </p> <p>The European commission thinks Germany and Spain may be next and Britain is also on the brink. Dubbed the Celtic Tiger in the 1990s, the Irish economy is now facing its toughest time since it was hit by high unemployment and emigration in the 1980s.</p> <p>Jonathan Loynes, of Capital Economics, said: \"The Irish boom has well and truly turned to bust. And with the European Central Bank fretting about inflation concerns elsewhere ... there is little help on the immediate horizon.\" He believes house prices, which have slumped 14% from their peak, will fall much further.</p> <p>Ireland's finance department said: \"Lower levels of new housebuilding had a major restraining influence on growth ... Other factors at work include higher commodity prices, global financial market problems, weak demand in our major trading partners and adverse exchange rate movements.\"</p>",
  "<p>Three of Britain's leading mortgage lenders raised the cost of home loans yesterday as a fortnight of turmoil in the global financial system pushed up the cost of borrowing for banks.</p> <p>HSBC, Woolwich and the internet and telephone bank First Direct added to the pressure on an already weak housing market when they raised mortgage rates by more than a quarter-point.</p> <p>The moves reflected the growing strains in wholesale markets since the collapse of Lehman Brothers last week. With banks hoarding cash and reluctant to lend to each other, the gap between the Bank of England's official bank rate and the three-month sterling Libor rate - one of the keys to borrowing costs - widened to a level not seen since the start of the credit crunch more than 13 months ago. Similar stresses were evident yesterday in euro and dollar Libor rates, both of which rose sharply.</p> <p>The Bank has pegged its rate at 5% since April, but three-month sterling Libor - what banks charge each other to borrow - rose to 6.27% in the City yesterday. In the five years before money markets first froze up in August 2007, the average spread between bank rate and three-month Libor was less than 0.2 of a point.</p> <p>Rates in the money markets fell between July and early September, pushing down the cost of a two-year fixed-rate mortgage to levels not seen since the start of the crunch. This led borrowers and consumer groups to hope that the market for mortgage finance was beginning to thaw.</p> <p>But wholesale markets have been shaken by this month's turbulence and borrowing rates have climbed sharply. Libor rates, which affect tracker mortgages, have risen by about half a percentage point, while two-year swap rates, on which fixed-rate deals are based, have increased from 5.18% last week to 5.56%.</p> <p>Graham Turner, of GFC Economics, said: \"The fallout from the failure of Lehman Brothers continues to leave its mark. The collapse in counterparty confidence has driven Libor rates up to new highs.</p> <p>\"The repeated run-ups in Libor and swap spreads demonstrate that the financial crisis is getting deeper and that the proposed bailout has merely bought a few days' grace.\"</p> <p>Nick Parsons, head of analysis at NAB Capital, said: \"The gap between bank rate and three-month sterling Libor is higher than it has been at any time since before the collapse of Northern Rock a year ago. The Libor rate is the one which matters in the outside world because it applies to individuals, companies and public bodies. Anybody with a Libor-linked loan is seeing a fairly significant increase in borrowing costs.\"</p> <p>He said the injections of liquidity from the Bank of England, the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank meant banks had no trouble borrowing money overnight but it was much harder to find three-month loans. In London yesterday, the Bank of England's cash auction was oversubscribed by \u00a336bn, with banks preferring to borrow from Threadneedle Street rather than each other.</p> <p>Parsons said the fear of fresh bank failures and the desire to improve balance sheets had led to banks hoarding cash, driving up money-market rates. \"The current structure of interest rates is not consistent with anything we know, let alone fear, about the UK economy. It may be that interest rates will have to be cut dramatically to stop output from dropping significantly. It is a horrible state of affairs.\"</p> <p>Simon Ward, chief economist with fund management group New Star, said the Bank of England could help to ease the pressure on banks by cutting the fee charged for using its special liquidity scheme, which allows banks to exchange mortgage-backed securities for gilts for a limited period. This would partially relieve upward pressure on banks' funding costs and, by extension, household and corporate borrowing rates.</p> <p>HSBC said it was increasing its fixed-rate deals for borrowers with just a 10% deposit by 0.3 of a point, while cutting fixed-rate loans by 0.2 of a point for those putting down a 25% deposit. The bank added that it was reducing arrangement fees for people borrowing 90% of their home's value from \u00a3799 to \u00a3499, while fees for people taking out a 75% loan would be \u00a3999.</p> <p>The Woolwich is increasing its fixed-rate mortgage deals by up to 0.35 of a point, while tracker ones are rising by 0.05 of a point. The move leaves a three-year fixed rate loan for a borrower with a 40% deposit who pays a \u00a3995 arrangement fee at 5.89%, while someone with a 10% deposit will have to pay 6.99%.</p> <p>First Direct increased its two-year fixed-rate loans by up to 0.3 of a point, meaning its current market-leading deal of 4.99%, which comes with fees of \u00a31,998, rises to 5.19%.</p>",
  "<p>MEPs yesterday put the European parliament on a collision course with Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, and its powerful car lobby by rejecting Berlin's campaign to water down European proposals for slashing greenhouse gases from road traffic.</p> <p>In a move that stunned the car industry and green campaigners, the parliament's environment committee voted by a sweeping majority to force car manufacturers to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions of new vehicles by 2012 and to maintain stringent fines on those that fail to do so. </p> <p>The MEPs threw out amendments that the car lobby had introduced which would have eased the costs to industry and delayed the measures. By voting them down, the MEPs rejected a Franco-German pact hatched by Merkel and France's president, Nicolas Sarkozy, in June.</p> <p>As part of its drive to lead the world in tackling climate change, the European commission last year proposed that all new cars would have to cut their CO2 emissions to 130 grammes per kilometre by 2012, roughly a 17% reduction on average emission levels. The German auto industry, a world leader in the large car sector, cried foul and mounted ferocious lobbying to dilute the proposals.</p> <p>Merkel has fought energetically for months to get the proposed regime weakened. At a summit in June with Sarkozy (who is currently chairing the EU and responsible for steering the climate- change package into law by the end of the year), both leaders agreed that the original commission proposals should be weakened by staggering the cuts until 2015, and halving the proposed fines levied on car firms for each offending vehicle they produced from \u20ac95 (\u00a375) per excess gramme/kilometre to \u20ac50.</p> <p>The environment committee yesterday rejected both compromise measures, backing the commission's initial proposals and stipulating that CO2 emissions should come down further, to 95g/km by 2020. The parliament's industry committee had already caved in to pressure and supported the diluted proposals.</p> <p>\"The parliament appears to have stood up to the demands of the car industry and four or five car-producing member states, and has sent a strong signal that Europeans need fuel-efficient cars now, not in five or 10 years,\" said Jos Tings, of the Transport and Environment pressure group.</p> <p>\"The lobby from the car industry lost,\" said Chris Davies, the Liberal Democrats' environment spokesman. \"MEPs today stood up for tougher measures to combat global warming and sent a strong message to corporate lobbyists to back off. A good day for democracy.\"</p> <p>The result was all the more surprising since, under intense car industry pressure, the two biggest caucuses in the parliament, the centre-right European People's party and the socialists, had tabled amendments in line with the Merkel-Sarkozy deal. But in the end the committee's vote was 46-19.</p> <p>The CO2 emissions of cars make up about 14% of such emissions in Europe. The commission proposals are a key part of the overall climate-change package to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 - proposals that need to be turned into law by the end of the year if the EU is to maintain its credibility as a world leader in the fight against global warming. The overall package has to be agreed by the commission, the parliament and the 27 EU governments, meaning there is now likely to be a showdown between Berlin and the parliament before Christmas.</p> <p>\"This was a big surprise,\" said the German Green MEP Rebecca Harms. \"There was a big fight with industry and governments, and the Germans and French were adding a lot of pressure.\"</p> <p>European leaders have endorsed the broad aims of the commission proposals and proclaimed themselves world leaders in tackling global warming, but the real battles - about dividing the burden between nations and sectors of industry - are now breaking out.</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p>A summit of European leaders agreed in March last year to cut <strong>greenhouse gases </strong>by a minimum of <strong>20% </strong>by 2020. A month earlier the commission had proposed to compel the car industry to cut CO2 emissions from new cars and vans to <strong>130g/km</strong>. The commission refined its proposals last December. But <strong>Merkel</strong>, a former environment minister who presided over the March summit and was hailed as a hero, railed against the <strong>costs to industry</strong>. In March this year she broached the topic with <strong>Sarkozy</strong>,<strong> </strong>who was preparing to assume the EU presidency and steer the climate change package into law. At a bilateral summit in June, the two agreed to <strong>water down </strong>the proposals.</p>",
  "<p>Fela Kuti will be \"dancing in his grave\". That's what his son, Femi, says. The reason for the late Afrobeat pioneer's posthumous pleasure? An event that perfectly captures the spirit of the old Afrika Shrine, the celebrated nightclub that he ran in the Nigerian capital in the 70s. On October 18, as the climax of this year's Felabration festival in Lagos, there's to be a very special concert outside Femi's own Afrika Shrine. A crowd of 10,000 will be there for an all-night show that's just the start of the bravest, most high-profile venture yet by Africa Express, the ever-expanding group of African and British musicians who specialise in lengthy shows and bravely spontaneous collaborations. </p> <p>So who will be taking part in this latest event? As ever, AE is making no announcements in advance. But Fela's sons Femi and Seun will certainly be present, with Femi \"jumping on the stage and playing with anybody. It will be my duty to work with as many people as possible.\" His guests will include Baaba Maal, Amadou and Mariam, Damon Albarn and Tony Allen, the percussion genius who worked with Fela and recently collaborated with Albarn in the Good, the Bad and the Queen. Jon McClure, formerly the leader of Reverend and the Makers, is \"very much looking forward to it\", and it's likely that the cast will also include Bassekou Kouyate and Rachid Taha. Ginger Baker, the former Cream drummer, who was also one of the first British rock musicians to work with his African counterparts (he played with Fela), has accepted an invitation, while Franz Ferdinand - who took part in the last AE event in Liverpool - are \"hoping to go and pretty excited\", according to Alex Kapranos, and the same goes for the Magic Numbers. According to Ian Ashbridge, one of AE's founders, \"We won't know who will be there until the last minute - it's all voluntary and there are no contracts.\"</p> <p>When the Lagos show is over, Femi Kuti will stay behind to wind up Felabration while the rest of the AE lineup heads for London and two more wildly experimental shows, with Souad Massi joining the troupe. On October 22, they will be at Koko in London for another set of impromptu collaborations that is scheduled to last until 4am. This will be the fourth AE show in the UK but will reach a far bigger audience and far more attention than their earlier, low-key outings because it will be broadcast on Radio 1 as part of the Electric Proms, which presents a rare opportunity for African stars who might normally expect to appear on Radio 3. It won't just be a passing snippet either: Radio 1 is to broadcast all five hours of the Koko show live, from 11pm until the show finishes at around four the following morning, and the show will also be on BBCTV, through the interactive red button.</p> <p>The following night many of the African artists (but not the British stars) will head across town to the Barbican, for the Africa Now show. This event is somewhat more conventional, simply because the lineup - part of it, at least - has actually has been announced in advance. It will include Baaba Maal, Rachid Taha, Amadou and Mariam and Senegalese rappers Daara J. </p> <p>What's extraordinary about Africa Express is that it defies all the normal rules of pop promotion. There's no product to plug, the artists aren't paid, and there's only a rudimentary running order for the shows, allowing as much spontaneity as possible. The aim is to present African and western musicians on an equal footing, encourage collaboration, and allow new audiences to discover African music. The man unwittingly responsible for all this was Bob Geldof, who infuriated African musicians (and African music fans) by assembling an almost exclusively non-African cast for the massive London Live 8 concert in July 2005. A second concert for African artists at the Eden Project in Cornwall enjoyed far less TV coverage, and led to mutterings about musical apartheid.</p> <p>Africa Express was as an attempt to put that right. The initial aim was for two concerts, in London's Hyde Park and in Bamako, Mali, and according to Ashbridge \"Albarn was keen on collaboration from the start.\" The first AE outing, in September 2006, took Albarn, Martha Wainwright, Norman Cook and beat-boxer Scratch to Mali to meet the likes of Salif Keita, Amadou and Mariam and Toumani Diabate, with the western musicians joining in the musical sessions. Back in London, they tried to repeat the experience at Jamm in Brixton, where the audience didn't know what to expect but were treated to an improvised show with no set list, involving Albarn, Souad Massi, Amadou and Mariam and others, with the Kaiser Chiefs in the audience. </p> <p>Last year, the experiments continued at Glastonbury, with Billy Bragg, Toumani Diabate, Amadou and Mariam, Norman Cook, the Magic Numbers and others collaborating on a stage well away from the television cameras or the crowds who had clearly not heard of Africa Express and didn't know what an historic show they were missing. Albarn said he didn't want publicity in advance, \"because I love that word of mouth thing\". So it continued, with a trip to the Democratic Republic of Congo last October followed by a another lengthy experimental show this March in the fading splendour of the Liverpool Olympia, where a remarkable line-up turned out to play in front of a small audience who clearly didn't expect Franz Ferdinand to be collaborating with Baaba Maal.</p> <p>The experience of working with African musicians has had a startling effect on the British bands involved. Alex Kapranos says the Liverpool show was \"the most exciting gig that Franz Ferdinand played this year. The best thing about it was that there was no planning at all, and that's what really turned me on. We had about five minutes to rehearse, and it was a complete contrast to the average indie gig you go to, where the band has been playing the same songs over and over for weeks. Safety is the enemy of any musician\". Jon McClure agrees: \"It's an amazing experience and sharpens your game as a musician. It's good to get out of your comfort zone\".</p> <p>The Africans also approved. Baaba Maal says he enjoyed performing with Rachid Taha and with Franz Ferdinand (\"I want to push that one if I get the chance. I love Take Me Out and I love the fact that they come from a different environment\"), while Amadou Bagayoko, of Amadou and Mariam, enthuses about the attraction of working with \"hundreds of musicians, from Damon Albarn to K'Naan or Son of Dave\". But he reckons playing with Romeo Stodart of the Magic Numbers was \"the best collaboration so far because we have similar ways of playing the guitar\". The on-stage collaborations are moving to the studio, with Albarn appearing on the forthcoming Amadou and Mariam album, and McClure inviting the Malian ngoni star Bassekou Kouyate to record with his new band Mongrel, including former Arctic Monkey Andy Nicholson. </p> <p>There have been collaborations in earlier pop eras, of course - the Stranglers joined the Burundi Drummers at an early Womad festival, Peter Gabriel has worked with the likes of Papa Wemba, and Ginger Baker played with Fela Kuti back in the 70s. So the idea is not new, but as Ashbridge says: \"We've gone backwards since those days, and we are trying to redress the balance and treat African and western artists the same way. It's not about sales, but kids who are into Franz Ferdinand will ask, 'Who is this Baaba Maal they are playing with?'\" Stodart agrees: \"If I read an interview with Johnny Marr saying he likes Bert Jansch, I go out and buy a Jansch album. So this could bring our followers to African music.\" </p> <p>Africa Express may change British music, but the aim is to bring change to Africa too. The Lagos concert will be the first major event AE has staged on the continent, and Femi Kuti predicts \"this event will make things happen. Sponsors will come who might want to build concert halls, so that bands can tour in Africa. We need more concerts in Africa and it will show solidarity to the African cause.\"</p>",
  "<p>The pottery barn rule - \"if you break it, you own it\" - started life as a notice in an American crockery chain, and has now become part of the US political lexicon. Most often applied to Iraq, where it means \"you created this problem, you solve it\", the rule makes a nice and necessary distinction between two kinds of political ownership: the good kind - \"the Republicans own low taxes\" - and the bad kind, \"the Democrats own big government\".</p> <p>As will be very clear in Birmingham next week, the Conservatives continue to lay claim to ownership of the \"broken society\" in the former, positive sense. The party wants us to believe it has both the will and the policies to tackle teenage pregnancy, family breakdown, drug abuse, sink estates and antisocial behaviour, and that Labour doesn't. What they don't want us to think is that any of this is their fault.</p> <p>The battle between these two senses of ownership may provide an explanation for the so-called broken society's strangely intermittent history. When it was first seriously floated during the 2005 Tory leadership campaign - by Liam Fox, as it happens - commentators cast it as an updated version of John Major's ill-fated 1993 back-to-basics campaign, which indeed it was. That campaign was itself a revival of an early initiative to blame the 1981 riots in five English cities on the liberal ideas of the 1960s. </p> <p>Both these campaigns had a truncated history. The anti-60s campaign was trumped by external events: five days after Margaret Thatcher blamed the riots on \"the fashionable theories and permissive claptrap\" of the 1960s, General Galtieri knocked the issue off the table by invading the Falkland Islands. Back to basics was notoriously scuppered by a series of sexual and financial scandals involving Tory ministers.</p> <p>The historical precedent might be one reason why, once launched, the current slogan virtually disappeared from the stage at last year's conference. In his leader's speech, David Cameron cited broken homes and promises, but not the broken society. The phrase was absent from his 2008 new year message. </p> <p>This year, however, it is back with a vengeance. In July, both Cameron and George Osborne made major speeches on the subject. Not, of course, because society is more radically broken than it was 10 years ago - teenage pregnancy rates are at their lowest for 20 years, divorce rates have fallen for a third year, violent crime is down by 40% since 1997. Nor, surely, does Cameron need to return to the dog-whistle, socially authoritarian politics that did so little for William Hague. There is another explanation. It's the economy, stupid.</p> <p>What do the early 1980s, the early 1990s and this period have in common? They are all times of recession. The riots of the early 80s were seen as a consequence of the steep rise in unemployment that resulted from deliberate government policy; hence Thatcher's concern to blame them on a lack of personal self-restraint. Following the early-90s recession, Major defined the \"core values\" he wanted to get back to as a belief in individual responsibility. In his contribution to the 1993 Tory conference, Peter Lilley waved his \"little list\" of perceived welfare scroungers who were to be targeted. And significantly, home secretary Michael Howard used his speech to counter claims - made, incidentally, by Tony Blair - that crime was the result of government policies.</p> <p>No surprise, then, that back-to-basics has reappeared. In his July 7 speech, Cameron echoed the 80s campaign by blaming social breakdown on \"a decades-long erosion of responsibility, of social virtue, of self-discipline\", insisting that poverty, social exclusion and obesity resulted from \"the choices people make\". A week later, George Osborne clamped the campaign directly to economics; by placing unwarranted demands on the state, the broken society is delaying the achievement of a \"low-tax economy\". So, there it is. The poor are ripping off the rich. It's all their fault.</p> <p>Easy to advance when unemployment is concentrated among an isolated underclass, this argument is harder to sustain in an era when millions are threatened by the irresponsibility of the rich. Britain's poverty, poor health and low life expectancy are concentrated in those parts of the country whose means of economic existence were destroyed by the 1979-97 Conservative governments, demoralising whole regions, destroying social institutions and breaking up families. The growing economic divide that the Tories now complain about is between the victors and victims of 18 years of Thatcherism. Yes, Labour should have done more to reverse it. But if it's broke, it's the Tories what broke it. In the pottery barn sense, it's theirs.</p> <p>In a leadership campaign statement in July 2005, Fox attributed \"what is increasingly becoming a broken society\" to \"the 1980s forces which generated economic revival\", but which also \"markedly reduced the role of the extended family and the security it represented\". Hence, \"the decline in secure family life, of good order in our schools and of good behaviour on our streets\". Now market forces are generating economic disaster, it's unlikely anyone will put it quite like that again. The re-emergence of the broken society slogan in a time in which, as the government fears, crime and social breakdown are likely to rise, is essentially about passing the buck. </p> <p>It also says something important about the whole detoxification project. The idea of New Conservatism as a genuine sea-change, embracing an acceptance of the reforms of the past decade as New Labour accepted much of Thatcherism, is based not on economic but social policy. It's the idea that the Cameroonies are genuinely comfortable with multiracial Britain and concerned about the environment; that on issues of gender, sexuality and social mores, they know the tune as well as the words. </p> <p>The return of the broken society slogan may herald a change. Before it all went quiet last year Cameron said the economy wasn't broken any more, but that society was. Now, as in 1981 and 1993, it's the broken economy that is threatening social cohesion, rather than the other way round. No wonder the Tories are rushing back to the social-conservative agenda. After all, they've always owned that.</p> <p>\u2022 David Edgar is a playwright </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:DavidEdgar@blueyonder.co.uk\">DavidEdgar@blueyonder.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>When Natalie Cole released her album, Unforgettable ... With Love, in 1991, many in the music industry suspected she had gone mad. This was the era of grunge and gangsta rap, and the idea of a pop singer releasing a collection of American jazz standards was unheard of. \"My record company thought I was crazy,\" she says. \"They were like, 'It'll never sell.'\" So they were in for another shock when the album rocketed towards sales of 14m copies. \"It was a lot of fun watching people panic,\" she laughs. \"The radio programmers, the record labels, the stores. They were reporting, 'People are buying this who haven't bought a record in 20 years!'\"</p> <p>The collection featured a duet with her late father, Nat King Cole, and set a benchmark for the American standards movement; since then, everyone from Rod Stewart to Robbie Williams has crooned their way through the classics. Seventeen years later, Cole is delving into the songbook again with Still Unforgettable, wrapping her vocals around classics such as Come Rain Or Come Shine and Something's Gotta Give. Why did it take so long for her to do a follow-up? \"It takes a long time to chase greatness,\" she says simply.</p> <p>At 58, Cole is a mix of quite jaw-dropping confidence and a hint of vulnerability. Having sung with Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett and Ray Charles, she receives a lot of requests to do duets with \"Joe Schmoe\". \"No thank you,\" she says in a mock-polite voice. \"I've sung with the best ... so I don't wanna sing with just anybody.\" But she admits that it has taken until her 21st studio album to feel comfortable producing her own record. \"I have really been doing it most of my career,\" she says, \"but I was just paying someone else to do it while I looked over their shoulder. I always felt I needed someone telling me what to do. Turns out that I didn't need that at all.\"</p> <p>Cole bristles as she reflects on the inequities of the music business, in which women's private lives are constantly monitored, and \"it's not so much about their talent, it's about their visual\". She thinks that there is a lot more pressure on female artists than when she started. \"Women are required to look good 24 hours a day. Oh my God. Sheryl Crow's about the only one who gets away with wearing jeans. That takes a lot of time. You'd rather be spending time on your work, your craft, and you have to spend three or four hours in makeup for a show that might last 45 minutes! \" </p> <p>She is more than happy to call herself a feminist. \"I believe that a woman should be paid the same amount as a man if she does the same job. I think that we're extraordinary creatures who can run a company and a house ... \" </p> <p>Growing up, the fame of Cole's father inevitably led to insecurities about her own talent. Nat King Cole became a major mainstream black icon in the 40s and 50s after hits such as Mona Lisa and When I Fall In Love, and always refused to play segregated venues. In 1956 he became one of the first African-Americans to host a network TV show. Despite ratings success, NBC quickly dropped the programme because sponsors were nervous about backing a black artist - Cole famously quipped that, \"Madison Avenue is afraid of the dark.\"</p> <p>Natalie Cole was just 15 when her father died of lung cancer in 1965, and his death had a profound effect. \"When you lose a parent in your early teens, it's like you're still a child. I never got to make that transition from little girl to young woman . . . and that really screws you up.\" She dealt with the grief by trying to distance herself from the memory of her father. For a long time, she says, \"I hated my name, I thought it was horrible. It was too much pressure. Well, whose daughter are you? Duh! I didn't feel like I was an individual.\"</p> <p>Cole grew up in a wealthy white enclave of Los Angeles, and, attending the University of Massachusetts in the late 1960s, she reacted against her upbringing by growing an afro and joining the Black Panthers. She was also at the forefront of the anti-Vietnam war demonstrations. \"My mother goes to me, 'I didn't send you to school to do that,'\" says Cole. \"But you don't sit at the side and discourse - you get in there! I was part of a generation of people who tried to make a difference, and I'm proud of that. I was raised in a very protected environment and didn't have a lot of black friends as a child. When I went to college I realised I was a black person too. It was a great eye-opener for me, which is why I got involved.\" </p> <p>How does she feel now about the prospect of a black president? \"I would love to see Obama in the White House,\" she says. \"My country is in such disrepair, morally and financially, that we need his ideals and integrity. The fact that he's black makes me proud, but even if he wasn't, I'd still want him to be president.\" </p> <p>Cole may have inherited her father's idealism, but as a performer in the early 70s she was keen to forge a distinct musical identity, and flung herself headlong into funk and R&amp;B. In 1975 she had her first No 1 single with This Will Be (An Everlasting Love) and won a Grammy award for her debut album, Inseparable. At the same time, her personal life was careering out of control. She had developed an addiction to heroin and crack cocaine that was so serious that she crashed her car while high and her young son, Robert, nearly drowned in the family pool when she was on a drug binge. Cole hit rock bottom when she refused to leave a burning building because she needed to score. In her 2000 autobiography, Angel on My Shoulder, she writes: \"Smoke poured under the door to my hotel suite. It was so thick that it was getting hard to breathe.\" She was trapped in the room with her bodyguard, and, in the belief that they were doomed, he suggested they have sex. Cole had other ideas. \"No thanks,' I said, 'If I'm going to go, I'm not going straight.' I fished my freebase kit out of my purse and started cooking cocaine.'\" </p> <p>When they were rescued, Cole realised it was time to address her addiction. She went into rehab in 1983. \"I literally lay my life in their hands, not knowing if there was a career left for me, not knowing if I could keep custody of my son. At some point everything starts disintegrating around you, and you have to make a choice. That one commitment to do whatever it takes means exactly what it says. It's not easy.\"</p> <p>By the late 80s Cole was off drugs and released Dangerous, her first \"sober album\". \"I was very vulnerable,\" she says now. </p> <p>\"I didn't know what was gonna happen. I had to believe that talent was going to make the difference. Luckily, it did.\" Dangerous yielded several Top 10 hits, including a version of Bruce Springsteen's Pink Cadillac. </p> <p>From then on, Cole steadily rebuilt her career until she reached a place of relative harmony; with two marriages and one annulment behind her, it has been hard-won. That is why she reacted instinctively when she saw Amy Winehouse perform at the Grammy Awards earlier this year. At a party afterwards Cole told journalists, \"I don't agree with the Grammys giving [Amy] those nods. I think it sends the wrong message.\" The next day her comments were headline news, and she was accused of being unkind to Winehouse. </p> <p>Cole is unrepentant. \"Her behaviour was being glorified. I was upset with the Grammys ... They took advantage of a young girl who's very ill. How can you tell someone they are sick and reward them at the same time?\"</p> <p>She reflects on the vilification that young female artists such as Britney Spears and Winehouse have received at the hands of the press. \"I remember what it was like to be under the microscope, I had some tabloid scrutiny, but I didn't have paparazzi stalking me.\" She thinks it would have hindered her recovery if she had. </p> <p>Cole is well aware of the long-term effects of addiction. In July she was diagnosed with hepatitis C, a potentially life-threatening virus caused by sharing needles decades ago. A strong dose of interferon has eradicated the virus for now, but she has to maintain the treatment.</p> <p>Over the years, Cole has moved closer and closer to the cool jazz sound immortalised by her father. Listening to his music used to be painful for her, but now it simply brings back fond memories. When she mixes her vocals with his - as she does again on this latest album - she finds it \"very gratifying. It feels like a tribute to a great man ... His phrasing is unique. It takes a minute to capture that, I had to study it. But what made me feel good is that I've inherited some of that ability. </p> <p>And I feel fortunate that he's left me so much great music.\" She gives a mischievous grin. These days, it seems, Cole is happy to be her father's daughter.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Still Unforgettable is released on Monday on Rhino/WEA.</p>",
  "<p>The credit crunch hit one of the stalwarts of the American economy yesterday. General Electric, the only one of the original dozen constituents of the Dow Jones industrial average still there 112 years later, warned that the crisis had knocked a $2bn (\u00a31.1bn) hole in its annual profits.</p> <p>The world's fourth-largest company also announced steps to shore up its financial arm, GE Capital, after \"unprecedented weakness and volatility in the financial services markets\". </p> <p>In the drive to preserve cash at a time when the global money markets have seized up, GE dumped its $15bn share buyback programme and admitted it will merely maintain its dividend next year, the first time it has not increased payments since the 1970s.</p> <p>The conglomerate, which spans energy, healthcare, financial services and media, stressed that it is financially sound and GE Capital will outperform all peers this year. But the group, which can trace its heritage back to the invention of the electric light by Thomas Edison, dropped its profit forecast for the third quarter by 16% and for the full year by 12%, more than $2bn.</p> <p>\"GE anticipates that difficult conditions in the financial services markets are not likely to improve in the near future,\" it said.</p> <p>GE Capital spans commercial loans, home loans, insurance, credit cards and personal loans, which accounted for more than half group profits last year.</p> <p>To reduce the risk in the business and help improve its liquidity, GE Capital will be allowed to retain more of its profits. It had been paying 40% of earnings to GE, but that will fall to 10%. To plug the gap at group level, GE has called a halt to share buybacks and frozen the dividend. </p> <p>Even so, GE, which also owns TV and film group NBC Universal, said it expects profits for the third quarter to be 43-48 cents a share, down from its original forecast of 50-54 cents.</p> <p>For 2008 as a whole, GE, expects to make profits of between $19.5bn and $21bn - or $1.95-2.10 a share. That is down from its previous estimate of between $22bn and $23bn. Wall Street had been forecasting that the company would make about 52 cents a share in the third quarter and $2.21 a share for the year.</p> <p>Chairman and chief executive Jeff Immelt said: \"We run the company for the long term ... Given the recent dramatic developments in the financial markets, we have made some tough decisions to further reduce risk and strengthen our balance sheet while maintaining our dividend commitment.</p> <p>\"We have suspended the stock buyback to reduce GE Capital leverage, while still being able to pursue opportunistic acquisitions. While the financial services markets remain challenging and require us to adapt quickly to the rapidly changing environment, we will continue to run GE Capital to be safe and secure, while earning high margins on conservatively underwritten business.\"</p> <p>GE stressed that GE Capital does not need to raise any more cash this year, having gained $70bn in long-term funding in the past nine months, but the company wants to skew its business away from finance and back to more traditional industrial markets over the next year.</p>",
  "<p>Business leaders and trade unions yesterday appealed for a cut in interest rates as the British economy continues to struggle amid the worldwide financial crisis.</p> <p>An unlikely combination of the British Chambers of Commerce, Channel 4 chairman and entrepreneur Luke Johnson and the TUC demanded that the Bank of England's rate-setting committee make the cut when it meets next week.</p> <p>Their hopes were dampened when a member of the monetary policy committee, Kate Barker, said her primary concern was still inflation, which has risen sharply in recent months as a result of surging food and fuel prices.</p> <p>David Kern, economic adviser to the BCC, said: \"It is clear that inflation will reach its peak within the next two or three months. As the global financial crisis worsens, there is an urgent need to act promptly, in order to counter severe threats of recession. The MPC should urgently consider a rate cut to 4.75% in October.\" </p> <p>Johnson believes that the government should alter the MPC's remit so it considers economic growth and business activity as well as inflation. \"The only key measure they use is inflation. They need to take other things into account such as business activity and GDP in order to stimulate business investment.\" </p> <p>TUC head of economics Adam Lent said yesterday that the financial crisis had halted economic growth and left no domestic inflationary pressures. \"With recession looming, economic growth must now be the priority and the Bank must cut rates aggressively.\" </p> <p>Barker's hawkish remarks suggest, however, that it is far from certain the MPC will cut rates next Thursday. </p> <p>Speaking to business leaders in Cheshire, she said: \"At present I remain somewhat concerned about the possibility of more persistent higher inflation, even as growth slows.\"</p> <p>While recent financial turmoil has increased the risk to the economy, she added that it was \"not easy to form a clear view\" about how restrictive holding rates at 5% would prove to be. </p> <p>Despite a lack of wage inflation pressure as unemployment fears grow, she said it was \"too soon to dismiss completely\" concerns that a round of higher pay settlements could fuel inflation next year. \"Concern over the risk that higher inflation could become embedded is justified.\" </p> <p>Several economists have predicted that the Bank will cut rates by a quarter point to 4.75% in November but Barker warned that inflation expectations and perceptions \"have clearly moved higher\" during the year.</p> <p>Her comments came a day after fellow MPC member Andrew Sentance said policymakers should not \"over-react\" despite a week when financial markets went \"to hell and back\".</p> <p>But their comments contrast sharply with those of another committee member, David Blanchflower, who has called for an immediate interest rate cut. Blanchflower told the Guardian this week that \"the time for inaction is over\". </p> <p>He wrote: \"Inflation will fall sharply as demand declines and the impact of rising oil and commodity prices starts to wane. The time has come to cut interest rates decisively and soon.\"</p> <p>He voted for a half-point cut at the September meeting but rates were kept on hold.</p> <p>Inflation hit 4.7% this month, forcing Bank governor Mervyn King to write his third letter to Alistair Darling explaining why inflation has exceeded its official target of 2%.</p> <p>Barker's words will come as a further blow to housebuilders, hard hit by the credit crunch. The Construction Products Association said recently the number of homes being built was the lowest since 1945. </p> <p>John Stewart, director of economic affairs at the Home Builders Federation, said: \"The Bank has acknowledged there is no sign of rising inflation expectations, so it could safely cut bank rate in October, supporting the desperately struggling housing market, so critical to the wider economy.\"</p>",
  "<p>The government has broken a promise to stop accommodating children on adult psychiatric wards, the Conservatives said yesterday after using the Freedom of Information Act to gain evidence from NHS trusts.</p> <p>Andrew Lansley, the shadow health secretary, said data from 52 of the 72 mental health trusts in England revealed that 26 children under 16 were treated on adult wards in 2007-08. They also accommodated 390 young people aged 16 and 17.</p> <p>If the figures were scaled up to take account of the trusts which failed to reply, they would show about 750 under-18s were treated on adult mental health wards, Lansley said.</p> <p>In November 2006, the charity Young Minds disclosed that there were not enough emergency beds for children with mental health problems. It said almost 1,000 under-18s spent time on an adult ward during the course of a year and more than half of those admissions were inappropriate. Sir Al Aynsley-Green, the children's commissioner, called the situation \"a national scandal\".</p> <p>Ivan Lewis, the health minister, pledged that no child under 16 would be treated on an adult psychiatric ward within two years.</p> <p>Other figures obtained by the Tories showed there were 435 sexual assaults on mental health patients in England last year, of which 15 were rapes. The party said the overall picture suggested assaults on children were up 13%, sexual assaults up 11% and rapes up 18%. Lansley said: \"It's shameful that mental health hospitals have become places where patients live in fear for their safety.\"</p> <p>The Department of Health said it had until November to deliver Lewis's promise not to treat children on adult psychiatric wards. By April 2010, all under-18s would be treated in an age-appropriate environment, a spokeswoman said. But she added that it would be \"inappropriate to introduce an absolute prohibition on 16- to 17-year-olds being placed on an adult ward, as this would mean some patients would not be treated in an environment suitable for their needs\".</p>",
  "<p>Wasps have already endured their worst start to a season since the launch of league rugby 21 years ago and life is not about to get any easier. Tonight the English champions must brace themselves for a bruising reunion with their fierce rivals Leicester at Welford Road and the prospect of a fourth consecutive defeat is concentrating the minds of all concerned, notably their international flanker Tom Rees.</p> <p>Rees has had his share of good times against the Tigers, announcing himself as an emerging back-row talent with a brace of tries against them in 2005 and scoring Wasps' first try in their Grand Final victory against the same opposition last May. This time, though, it is unbeaten Leicester who have the momentum under their new coach, Heyneke Meyer, and Rees is demanding a much-improved collective effort from a reshuffled Wasps line-up to avoid the club's first four-game losing streak in the Premiership since 2001.</p> <p>\"We've a long history of taking Leicester very seriously but our focus needs to be on ourselves,\" said Rees, determined that Lawrence Dallaglio's retirement should not weaken Wasps' competitive streak in big games. \"We need to make sure each of us turns up and does our job right and that we don't all try to rectify things single-handedly. We need to remember that we are decent players and pull together as a team - 15 players in hero mode tends not to work very well.\"</p> <p>Wasps are looking forward to the return of the gifted Danny Cipriani against Bath next Wednesday but at present their director of rugby, Ian McGeechan, is having to juggle relatively slender resources. He has increasing problems at hooker, where the club captain, Rapha\u00ebl Ibanez, and Joe Ward are both injured, creating a starting opportunity for Rob Webber and a place on the bench for Damien Varley, a triallist from Munster. Josh Lewsey's modest early-season form has prompted a switch to the wing, with Tom Voyce wearing No15, and Mark Robinson makes his first club start in a new half-back pairing with Jeremy Staunton. Rob Hoadley, appointed yesterday as assistant coach of Wales Under-20 on the glowing recommendation of Shaun Edwards, is on the bench.</p> <p>\"Our players know it's by far their biggest challenge this season,\" said McGeechan, who has handed the captaincy to Phil Vickery. \"But I'd like to think it'll provide the right environment to bring out the best in us. Shaun and I feel we've got the right group of players. We haven't got any bad apples.\"</p> <p>Also absent is the suspended James Haskell, who would have been a doubtful starter anyway because of the eye injury which led to the citing of Northampton's Irish flanker Neil Best yesterday. Best, who joined the Saints from Ulster this summer, has been charged with \"an act contrary to good sportsmanship\" and faces a ban of anywhere between six weeks and two years if found guilty by a three-man Rugby Football Union disciplinary panel on Tuesday. His Northampton team-mate Dylan Hartley received a six-month suspension last year after the hooker was found guilty on two counts of eye-gouging, coincidentally against Wasps.</p> <p>Leicester have made three changes to the side that won 19-17 at Worcester last Saturday, with starts for the prop Dan Cole, lock Marco Wentzel and former Newcastle flanker Ben Woods. </p> <p>Sale, also unbeaten, will set a Premiership record if their defence remains intact against Gloucester at Edgeley Park tonight. The Sharks have yet to concede a league try and no club in Premiership history has shut out the opposition for four games in a row. Andrew Sheridan (arm) and Chris Jones (knee) are missing and Mathew Tait will start on the wing despite England's desire to use him primarily as a full-back.</p>",
  "<p>Newcastle United remained managerless last night, after a day of intense negotiations concluded with Terry Venables turning down the chance to become Kevin Keegan's short-term successor. Mike Ashley, the club's owner, may now turn to David O'Leary, the former Leeds United and Aston Villa manager who has been out of work since 2006 and is eager to return to the front line.</p> <p>Although Ashley had hoped to persuade Glenn Hoddle to come out of managerial retirement, it is understood that the former England coach has no interest in the post. He apparently rejected an offer from Ashley before Venables was approached and is currently in Spain, where he is committed to developing a football academy project.</p> <p>Alan Curbishley's availability has also been noted but, in view of the fact that he resigned his position at West Ham because of misgivings about working within precisely the sort of continental-style management structure also in place at St James' Park, he appears an unlikely candidate. George Graham, the former Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur manager, was linked with the vacancy but has ruled himself out. O'Leary is understood to have significantly greater enthusiasm for the job but, even so, may balk at Ashley's idea of appointing a manager on a match-by-match basis.</p> <p>With Newcastle's owner desperate to sell - he has appointed the investment bank Seymour Pierce to find a buyer for the club - and a new regime likely to want to appoint its own coaching personnel, it is understood that Venables was initially offered the post on a game-to-game basis. After preliminary contact on Wednesday the former Barcelona, Tottenham, Portsmouth, Leeds and England manager met Ashley along with Dennis Wise - Newcastle's executive director (football) and a long-term friend of Venables - and other board members at Chelsea harbour yesterday.</p> <p>Before talks got under way in the morning Venables had intimated to friends that he was warming to the challenge of reviving Newcastle's fortunes, provided the contract offered a degree of security. But with Ashley sticking to his game-by-game proposal, the chances of Venables accepting receded and by early afternoon confidants learned that it was 50-50 whether he would say yes. Nevertheless Newcastle refused to compromise significantly and Venables duly walked away, apparently telling Ashley and company that the team's floundering players desperately needed the stability afforded by having a manager employed on a longer-term contract.</p> <p>\"Newcastle United means too much to too many people to take the job on a short-term basis,\" Venables told the Sun. \"It demands total commitment and dedication from a manager prepared to throw himself heart and soul into the club. I was ready and willing to give it a real go but all they could guarantee was I'd be in a job until Mike Ashley sells the club.\"</p> <p>A Nigerian consortium intends to lodge a formal bid before tomorrow's game at home to Blackburn, but City sources remain extremely dubious about the viability of an African takeover. However, Chris Nathaniel, the chief executive of NVA management, the entertainment company fronting the proposed offer, insists he and his colleagues are deadly serious and aim to reinstall Keegan as manager. Rumours of interest from China, the United States and even the United Arab Emirates continue to circulate but, even if a potential buyer begins the process of due diligence, it could take up to two months for a sale to be completed.</p> <p>By then Newcastle, who have lost four successive games and attracted their lowest crowd in 16 years for Wednesday's Carling Cup defeat by Tottenham, may well be badly adrift at the foot of the league. </p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown got his second respite of the week yesterday as the briefing war subsided over Ruth Kelly's resignation and he got stuck into the bigger of his two immediate crises by backing the Bush administration's $700bn (\u00a3380bn) financial bailout.</p> <p>In New York the prime minister could hardly do otherwise, though it will come back to haunt him if things go wrong. But so may the circumstances in which the news of the departure of Kelly, the transport secretary, emerged this week in Manchester.</p> <p>Who benefits from the timing of the leak? Twenty centuries since the Roman orator Cicero famously asked \"cui bono?\" the question still offers vital insight into political intrigue.</p> <p>The short answer is \"certainly not Brown\". His big fightback speech on Tuesday initially dominated the news cycle. In yesterday's YouGov poll for the Sun it even won him a bounce, putting him only 10% behind the Tories.</p> <p>But bickering over the Kelly affair may put paid to that. No 10 denies engineering a \"controlled explosion\" to lessen the impact of the resignation. The so-called \"rebels\" who want Brown out deny they leaked on his parade.</p> <p>Most likely there was a random sequence of events: cock-up, not conspiracy. Media omert\u00e0 over sources will prevent the truth emerging. But the damage is done. It reinforces corrosive mistrust at a moment when Brown's first respite - his half-decent conference speech - gave both sides a chance to close ranks. </p> <p>Both have form. Unauthorised leaks, some vicious, from No 10 this past year have offended many ministers, including Kelly. Deservedly or not, Damian McBride, Brown's political press officer, gets much of the blame. </p> <p>On the other side, at least one senior rebel briefed that last week's cabinet was \"hell\" - the week's most damaging leak, according to Brownites.</p> <p>The prime minister is weakened because his authority is again enfeebled. Activists may have liked the speech (\"he's listened to us\") and will scorn disloyalty. Labour MPs were split more sharply. \"A string of cliches to please the party and will fall apart in two days - and I'm a loyalist,\" said one. </p> <p>But Brown will have to have a tricky reshuffle now. How soon? Next week, some advisers tell him. When the financial crisis has settled, say others. </p> <p>Kelly could work out her notice for a while. No one blames her for the leak. But what is most corrosive is a belief in both camps that the other side is paranoid and spiteful (Brown), or callow and self-serving (the rebels). </p> <p>At a time of immense financial peril, squabbling over who is the \"novice\" of Brown's jibe (Cameron or Miliband?) is petty. Anxious voters seek action to protect jobs and families.</p> <p>High-level talks in New York give Brown, the global player more respected abroad than at home, a chance to put substance on the spin. His critics dare not strike at such a time. Or dare they?</p> <p>As Hitler's armies poured into France in 1940, the scale of the crisis was Neville Chamberlain's defence; Thatcher's too as the Gulf war loomed in 1990. But their critics decided otherwise. </p> <p>Manchester this week did not show David Miliband and his promoters in that light. If Brown looks weak and indecisive, the plotters do too.</p>",
  "<p>I knew God was a Trotskyite. Cern's absurdly oversold answer to the who-is-God question was snuffed out in Switzerland last week by a celestial helium leak. Don't dabble with the big bang: the curse will get you.</p> <p>Meanwhile, who-are-we questions are being answered as never before - and at a fraction of the cost. Archaeologists excavating at Stonehenge, for the first time in half a century, are rewriting the map of British prehistory. Once again it is our old friend, Preseli bluestone, that is hero of the hour. Its glories shall not go unsung.</p> <p>Wainwright and Darvill might sound like a pair of Yorkshire undertakers, but the two professors have long been testing their thesis that the secret of this great monument lies in its most sensational feature: the inner circle of bluestones from the bleak Preseli mountains in Pembrokeshire. Most come from a specific 3km slope on Carn Menyn, Wales's answer to Athens' Pentelicon.</p> <p>The myriad past theories of Stonehenge mostly take refuge in magic and religion. Inigo Jones cited the Roman gods, John Aubrey and William Stukeley the druids, while more recent aficionados proffer astronomy and even chronology, though who needed a clock on this scale is puzzling. The henge has also represented a serpent's egg, a vulva and a kingly shrine. Aliens, wizards and dragons have had their brief hour on its stage.</p> <p>All these theories collapse before the bluestone question. Why go to the colossal effort and expense of moving four-tonne megaliths 250km (150 miles) across land and sea from Preseli, a work of global engineering comparable only with the contemporary building of the Great Pyramid at Giza? And why then surround them so reverentially with 25-tonne sarsens?</p> <p>A suggested answer was given by Geoff Wainwright and Tim Darvill to the Society of Antiquaries two years ago, before the start of the current dig. They claimed that the bluestone - dark blue when freshly cut and speckled with white quartz - was thought to have curative properties. In other words, the key to Stonehenge lay not in magic or religion, but in the worldly human craving for longevity and pain relief. It was in the here and now, not the hereafter. As Darvill put it this week, Stonehenge was \"the neolithic A&amp;E unit for southern England\".</p> <p>Six years of excavation at Preseli have revealed settlements as old as four millennia BC, before Stonehenge. Burials also suggest visitors from far afield. The hills are peppered with holy wells, most of them spilling over pieces of the dolerite bluestone placed at their mouths, some carrying carved decoration. The stone, unique to the Preseli area, was clearly special.</p> <p>To the old archaeology, special tended to mean sacred. But the constant search for \"primitivist\" reasons for prehistoric phenomena is questioned by Wainwright and Darvill. Why not offer workaday, rational answers? Holy wells throughout history were curative, usually associated with components such as chalk, sulphur or iron.</p> <p>The plethora of wells at Preseli and the associated burial mounds appear to go back long before the bluestones arrived at Stonehenge, about 2300BC. This suggests that the wells and their bluestones were famed far and wide, a reputation repeated by the (albeit unreliable) Geoffrey of Monmouth in the middle ages.</p> <p>Into the 19th century, visitors could buy hammers in Amesbury to chip bits off Stonehenge in honour of the old tradition of its healing power. This may explain why only the underground parts of many of the bluestones survive, and why chippings are found in graves across the country, including at Silbury. Bluestone, like a copper bracelet, was plainly long thought to be a health-giving token.</p> <p>Everything about Stonehenge begins to fall in place with this theory. The crippled Amesbury archer and his son, who science tells us originated from the Alps and then Kent, join the mass of burials of mutilated visitors who appear to have travelled to Stonehenge over the centuries. Isotope analysis of the teeth enamel of the local \"Boscombe bowmen\" reveals time spent in the bluestone country of south Wales - perhaps in search of a \"second opinion\".</p> <p>Stonehenge's reputation must have been Europe-wide, explaining its uniquely splendid architecture. Like Lourdes (and like Harley Street), ceremony and even a touch of confidence trickery were adjuncts of the healing game. Hence the great processional way up from the river, the guarding sarsens and the mumbo jumbo of solstice alignment.</p> <p>Hence also the riches emerging from excavations two miles away at Durrington Walls by Sheffield University's Mike Parker Pearson. This is revealing a town of some 300 houses, not just a prehistoric Lourdes but \"the largest neolithic settlement in northern Europe\". Parker Pearson's theory is that this was a place of kingly burial, not incompatible with the Lourdes thesis.</p> <p>Yet even this week's newspaper reports could not avoid reference to druids, cults, pilgrims and magical powers. We seem to seek in superstition the answers to questions which we cannot wait for science to solve - just as we attribute the big bang to God. We want to see in Stonehenge a place of druids, dragons, horrors and Wordsworth's \"gigantic beings ranged in dread array ... And like a thousand gods, mysterious council hold\".</p> <p>Science is now unfurling the prehistory of Britain with all the tantalising excitement of an ancient map found in a dusty basement. That its answers are commonsensical rather than supernatural is surely a virtue. Radiocarbon dating has brought Stonehenge to life in a way that the old archaeology never could. It has dated the earliest settlement of the site to 7000BC, dated each phase of construction and located the birth of the Amesbury archer and other remains.</p> <p>What it has yet to crack is the most intriguing conundrum of all. The will to survive may be sufficient explanation for the appeal of the bluestones. But even quack remedies often have some basis in mineral and botanical fact.</p> <p>Medical science has found therapies in chalybeate and mud, in herbs, roots, vegetables and even human urine. Is it possible there is something in Preseli dolerite and rhyolite, when dowsed by good clean water, that does indeed do you good? Research shows the springs to be full of chloride and sulphur. But the goodness lies in the water, not just the stone. Were the lordly proprietors of Hospice Stonehenge sold a complete pup by those wily Welshmen who forgot to mention, please add water?</p> <p>Jacquetta Hawkes remarked that each age gets the Stonehenge it deserves, or perhaps the one that best reflects its concerns. Ours is the age of hypochondria. But even hypochondriacs can be ill, and can be cured. Ancient Britons were no different, and truly built themselves a national health service to last.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Stonehenge Deciphered is on BBC2 at 8pm tomorrow night <a href=\"mailto:simon.jenkins@theguardian.com\">simon.jenkins@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>So, has a loving kiss from a good woman changed Gordon Brown from a political frog into a political prince? Yesterday's striking YouGov poll in the Sun has some Labour optimists believing so. After a long run of wretched poll numbers, Labour is up seven points following Brown's Manchester conference speech, cutting the Conservative lead in half from 20 to 10. More polls this weekend may boost Labour further. For a party so starved of good political news, this is heady stuff.</p> <p>Something of it may last. A kiss can be a potent thing. In Jung's analysis of the frog prince legend, the princess's kiss represents the discovery of her own self, a transition to maturity and readiness for marriage. If the British electorate is that princess, then perhaps the voters have taken the same leap. Maybe the Sun poll shows they have stopped flirting with boys called David and are announcing themselves ready to embrace the Great Leader at last.</p> <p>Or maybe, as New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd said the other day, I overanalyse. The more quotidien truth is that all parties generally get a post-conference bounce. All three did in 2007. The Lib Dems had one last weekend. Labour is having one now - and, remember, it is easier to bounce up when you're a long way down. Next week is the Tories' turn. The real surprise would be no bounce at all.</p> <p>A conference bounce is a wave reabsorbed in the ocean. The long-term trend matters far more. Compare the July and August pre-conference numbers with the November post-conference ones - leaving out the hothouse conference season figures in September and October - and the change factor in recent years, professor of government John Curtice says, is mostly quite meagre. In 2005, the autumn of David Cameron's emergence, the Tories went up two points and Labour was unchanged after the conferences. In 2006, Tony Blair's farewell, the Tories were down one and Labour was unchanged. Last year was different - Tories up five and Labour down two. But that was untypical. This year may prove to be the same, but the precedents are against it.</p> <p>Labour's political chips are piled on the square of the board that says the turbulence of the world financial crisis will somehow energise the left and at the same time bring middle-of-the road voters flocking back in droves to the supposed safety of Brown. Perhaps they will, but the worst may not be over yet. Incumbents are just as likely to be blamed rather than embraced in hard times, so Labour should not get too excited too soon. Even after the Sun poll, Labour is still only on 31%, well below its 2005 election share of 35%. Sixty per cent of voters still say Brown does not understand what people are going through. And more of them think Labour should get rid of Brown than keep him.</p> <p>The truth is that it is just too soon to say. As the polling pattern shows, in normal times the things that were true before the conferences are mostly still true afterwards. Perhaps, with the financial mayhem, this year is the exception - Labour yearns to believe this is so. But the opposite is more likely, and the markets have not spoken their final word. It would be counter-intuitive to suppose on the basis of a single good but not brilliant speech that Brown is suddenly a liberated politician. Party unity is skin deep, and the skulduggery around Ruth Kelly's resignation certainly suggests business as usual. </p> <p>Brown's problem is that he cannot adapt as easily in big things as in little ones. His solution to his problems is to work harder to get the same message across better. This week's speech explicitly embodied that. And, yes, it was a better speech. But this week's bounce may mean he will stay in denial about the changes he really needs.</p> <p>This is far less about policy direction or who does what job than about the way the government works. What, for instance, is the prime minister really doing in the US this week? Originally this three-day trip was to lend his weight to the UN development conference - an important event. At Manchester, though, the trip was rebranded as Brown's one-man mission to reform the global economic system. Clearly premature, especially with the US financial system still on the edge, the only thing that is serious about this part of the initiative is the grandstanding. Yesterday's snaps of the Sarahs in New York were another false move. They smack of more clumsy exploitation at odds with the austere pretensions of Brown's speech.</p> <p>And then there's the dysfunctionality in Downing Street itself. The briefing and counter-briefing these days make journalism easy. A few weeks ago, one official confided an extraordinary story to me. Four years ago, ministers decided that Britain's South Atlantic island possession of St Helena needed to have an airport. If planes could land on the tiny island, more than 1,200 miles from the nearest continent, its economic and demographic decline could perhaps be turned around. Plans began to be made. The airport was scheduled to open in 2010.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the Foreign Office finally asked the Department for International Development to sign off on the airport. The file went up to the secretary of state, Douglas Alexander. But instead of giving the go-ahead himself, Alexander was required to pass the decision up to Downing Street. Brown insisted on reading all the papers in the St Helena file and afterwards asked personally to see all the tender documents, in case they did not give value for money. I am told the papers remain in Downing Street and that no final decision has yet been taken.</p> <p>It would be hard to find a better example of a decision that a prime minister in times of trouble should not waste his time on and one that should be delegated to ministers. What would Napoleon have said? But the St Helena episode has become a Whitehall byword for a lethal combination of micromanagement and indecision.</p> <p>Labour loyalists tell themselves the government has turned a corner. They think the Conservatives will be exposed next week for lack of substance. But David Cameron and George Osborne's relative silence on the financial crisis could be deceptive. They may be playing the rope-a-dope strategy, allowing Brown to overreach himself before hitting back more effectively than Labour expects. It happened last year and it may happen this. The truth is that, along with everything else in these volatile political weeks, we ain't seen nothing yet.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:martin.kettle@theguardian.com\"><br>martin.kettle@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>David Walker, in his article discussing the role that thinktanks play in influencing debate, and the question of how \"independent\" such research institutes can be when some appear to have distinct ideologies, mentioned the Charity Commission's interest in these issues (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/sep/17/policy.thinktanks\">Caught in the tank trap</a>, September 17).</p> <p>\"The Charity Commission has struggled to define what is and isn't political, as if that vital ingredient in competitive democracy were a bad thing,\" he suggested, adding: \"The Charity Commission, unfairly, now applies much tighter criteria of non-partisanship to would-be charitable thinktanks than to existing organisations.\" This is not true.</p> <p>Walker has missed a really fundamental point. As the charity regulator, our interest in thinktanks extends only to those which are charities - often established as research charities with educational purposes. As such, they must abide by charity law in return for generous tax breaks and other advantages.</p> <p>This means that they have more to consider in their work than their non-charity peers, because in law charities cannot have political purposes and cannot directly support a party political agenda. There is still plenty of scope for charities to be active in the political arena: they can campaign, lobby, write to and meet MPs to further their charitable work; but they cannot under any circumstances serve a political party.</p> <p>Charities also need to guard their independence when working in a political environment and be aware of any perceptions of bias that may arise that could bring their independence into question. In other words, if a thinktank wants to be a charity, it must behave like a charity.</p> <p>Walker says our commission \"spent months trawling over the activities of the Smith Institute, manually counting the number of 'political references' in transcripts of its seminars, on the grounds that a thinktank named for a former Labour party leader might be biased\". In this particular case we found that the trustees did not adequately manage the risks posed to the institute's independence, and it was vulnerable to the perception that it was involved directly in party politics - never acceptable for a charity. </p> <p>We used our powers to require the trustees to put this right, and they will need to report back to us in six months. We also looked into two other charitable thinktanks, Policy Exchange and Reform, and identified wider lessons from these cases for other charities.</p> <p>We have been very clear about what is or isn't acceptable activity. The rules are the same for all charities, and we are certainly not applying \"tighter criteria\" to charity thinktanks. </p> <p>Of course we accept that thinktanks operate close to the political environment - but the law requires, and the public expects, those which are charities to be independent and never engage in any form of party political activity. It is the responsibility of the trustees of charitable thinktanks to ensure this and to make sure that any involvement their charity has with political parties is balanced.</p> <p>\u2022 Suzi Leather is chair of the Charity Commission <a href=\"mailto:chair@charitycommission.gsi.gov.uk\">chair@charitycommission.gsi.gov.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Kgalema Motlanthe was sworn in as South Africa's president yesterday, putting allies of Jacob Zuma firmly in control of the government after they toppled Thabo Mbeki at the weekend. </p> <p>After a week of the most dramatic political upheaval since the collapse of apartheid, which saw a sitting president swept out of power in a matter of days, Motlanthe sought to reassure South Africans and the financial markets that there would be no dramatic policy changes. </p> <p>The new president pledged to maintain Mbeki's business-oriented economic strategy which has been criticised by many of Zuma's backers, including the unions and Communist party, potentially opening the way for further strife within the ruling African National Congress. </p> <p>\"Mine is not the desire to deviate from what is working. It is not for me to reinvent policy. Nor do I intend to reshape either cabinet or the public service,\" Motlanthe told parliament after his inauguration. \"In a turbulent global economy, we will remain true to the policies that have kept South Africa steady, and that have ensured sustained growth.\"</p> <p>That assurance was reflected in Motlanthe's cabinet which retained many former ministers including Trevor Manuel as finance minister. His resignation after Mbeki was removed sent the Johannesburg stock exchange and rand plummeting as investors feared the loss of the world's longest-serving finance minister, who has overseen continuous economic growth. </p> <p>Manuel said he had merely offered his resignation to allow the president flexibility in choosing his cabinet. But others saw the move as a warning against any significant policy change, despite the pressure from the left, that appears to have been responded to in Motlanthe's speech. </p> <p>Perhaps the most important cabinet change was the removal of Manto Tshabalala-Msimang as health minister. She fronted Mbeki's heavily criticised HIV/Aids policies, blocking the distribution of life-saving drugs in public hospitals and drawing derision at international conferences by suggesting garlic and lemon as a suitable treatment. </p> <p>The leaders of other political parties praised Motlanthe as a man of integrity, humble and hardworking. Pieter Mulder of the mostly Afrikaner Freedom Front-Plus, alluded to the possibility that Motlanthe could supplant Zuma, who is the ANC president, as the party's candidate for president in May's general election. He told parliament a story of two Afrikaner voortrekkers who harness their oxen in the dark only to discover in the morning that they had also harnessed a lion. </p> <p>Their problem, said Mulder turning towards the new president, was that having harnessed the lion they now had to find a way to let it go. The story provoked much laughter and a smile from Zuma who could hardly have missed Mulder's point. </p> <p>Some of the forces that coalesced around Zuma largely regarded him as a vehicle to drive Mbeki out. The unions and the Communist party in particular were seeking to pull Zuma to the left of where the outgoing government was. But their support falls behind Motlanthe more naturally as he is a former leader of the National Union of Mineworkers and trade union confederation stalwart. </p> <p>Motlanthe says he has no presidential ambitions but he would be an attractive presidential candidate for the ANC in May if Zuma's legal problems continue. </p> <p>There are already questions over the degree of Zuma's authority as party president. He publicly opposed removing Mbeki from office so either he was duplicitous or was unable to influence other ANC leaders. But if Motlanthe does not shift economic policy to the left, there is a strong possibility the ANC will split.</p> <p>Amid all the praise for Motlanthe, there was little for Mbeki. Tony Leon, foreign affairs spokesman for the opposition Democratic Alliance, compared his downfall to several Shakespearean tragedies. \"His presidency and the forces behind its collapse seem to combine the ambitions of Lady Macbeth, the jealously of Othello, the backstabbing of Iago and, ultimately in its last act, the impotent rage of King Lear,\" he said. But Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe's president, described Mbeki's removal from office as \"devastating\".</p>",
  "<p>World leaders yesterday announced an ambitious plan to end all malaria deaths by 2015, backed by unprecedented funding of nearly $3bn (\u00a31.6bn) from donors, including the World Bank and the Gates Foundation.</p> <p>A key part of the strategy is the introduction of a vaccine against the deadly disease, which is now just entering the final stage of trials. Although the vaccine is expected to be only partially effective, it will still save thousands of lives.</p> <p>A donation of $168.7m from Bill Gates today ensures that scientists will go on to develop further vaccines in the hope, eventually, of being able to give total immunity to all babies in affected countries soon after birth.</p> <p>Yesterday's announcements at a UN special summit on the millennium development goals in New York, attended by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, together with the presidents of Rwanda and Tanzania, Gordon Brown and other leaders, sets the bar in the fight against malaria higher than ever before.</p> <p>With tools that are now proven to work, such as long-lasting, insecticide-impregnated bed nets, indoor spraying against malarial mosquitoes, and new drugs as well as the expected vaccine, it is now hoped not only to bring malaria under control by 2010 but to eliminate deaths from the disease.</p> <p>Brown called the strategy launch \"a real and vital turning point\" which \"brings together a new coalition of forces - government, the private sector and NGOs - to ensure we all rise to the challenge of eradicating malaria deaths by 2015\". One million people die every year of malaria, most of them in Africa. </p> <p>The largest slice of the new money comes from the Global Fund, a body which finances the fight against Aids, tuberculosis and malaria, which has approved $1.62bn in country grants over two years and then the World Bank, which is putting $1.1bn into Africa over three years. </p> <p>The Bank is focusing on the Democratic Republic of Congo and Nigeria, where 30%-40% of all malaria deaths occur. Group president Robert Zoellick said endemic malaria also had serious financial consequences for families. </p> <p>\"Malaria preys on the poor and keeps them poor. Poverty prevents people from buying bed nets to prevent malaria and medicine to cure it,\" he said. \"When people are struck by the disease, parents miss work, children miss school and malaria emergencies plunge families into debt from which they can't recover.\"</p> <p>Bed nets, sprays and artemisinin drugs, derived from the Chinese wormwood plant, have all helped bring malaria rates down in some smaller countries, but a vaccine could have the biggest impact. </p> <p>The one about to enter final trials, which is being tested on 16,000 babies aged five to 17 months in a number of countries, seven of them in Africa, is the result of a public/private partnership by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals with the backing of the Path Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI). It has been shown to reduce malaria cases by 30% and halve the numbers of children getting severe malaria.</p> <p>Christian Loucq, director of MVI, said the new vaccine, currently known only as RTS,S, could be available by 2013, if it is swiftly approved by the European licensing authority and then the World Health Organisation, as seems likely. But the money from the Gates Foundation is a recognition of MVI's plans to engage researchers on the development of an even better vaccine.</p> <p>\"I'm very hopeful that the malaria vaccine currently in advanced testing will be proven effective, but that will just be the first step,\" said Bill Gates. \"Now it's time to develop a new generation of vaccines that could someday eradicate malaria altogether.\"</p>",
  "<p>Residents of the planned eco towns in England could face strict monitoring of their travel habits, home insulation and even wasted food, to ensure they are truly living a \"green\" lifestyle.</p> <p>Experts advising the government on its plans to build up to 10 eco towns by 2020, yesterday called for ministers to toughen environmental standards for the developments with monitoring to ensure their carbon footprint is three times smaller than the British average.</p> <p>The recommendation is that there should be detailed scrutiny of the number of trips residents make by car, and the types of waste produced by households and businesses. Thermographic cameras should be used to check which homes lose heat, according to the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (Cabe).</p> <p>The monitoring plans are part of the proposed standards for the government's flagship housing programme, which has been criticised for failing to demand the highest levels of sustainability.</p> <p>Cabe and Bioregional, the company that initiated the low-energy BedZed housing estate in south London, want the government to ensure that the carbon footprint of eco towns is no larger than allowed under principles of \"one-planet living\". </p> <p>At present, the average Briton is responsible for almost 12 tonnes of CO2 each year and if everyone in the world consumed as much, three planets would be required to support the human population. The average Chinese person is thought to live a \"one-planet\" lifestyle.</p> <p>\"If eco towns are to have a fundamental purpose, it must be to show us how we can all achieve one-planet living,\" said Richard Simmons, chief executive of Cabe. \"Eco towns should show us, in a real and measured way, what our sustainable future will look like.\"</p> <p>Cabe's proposed rules are stricter than the latest government guidance on eco towns and come in advance of the publication next month of draft planning policy setting out the levels of sustainability and environmental soundness of the new developments.</p> <p>Techniques for monitoring residents could include checking the ecological footprint of the diet of 100 randomly selected residents, and calculating CO2 emissions from transport movements.</p> <p>Opponents of eco towns, who have argued that the developments would be little more than standard housing estates, said the proposals would create a \"Big Brother\" environment.</p> <p>\"We are supposed to be free to live how we want and we don't need the authorities counting the miles we drive or taking thermal images of the draughts in our house,\" said David Bliss, chairman of Bard, the campaign against the Middle Quinton eco town in Warwickshire. \"We have talked about these places becoming like gulags and now we have the monitoring to match.\"</p> <p>Cabe is also calling for all homes to be powered by renewable energy with gas supply only available as a backup. It said there should be at least 50 dwellings per hectare (2.5 acres) rising to 100 in the centre, and retailers should provide plenty of products with a low meat and dairy content, in line with studies that showed a significant reduction in animal product meals could cut the ecological footprint of food by 60%. \"Consumer goods account for 14% of an individual's ecological footprint and the target should be to halve the impact from this,\" the report said.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown is to fly to Washington today for emergency talks on the financial crisis with George Bush, giving him a chance to throw his weight behind the $700bn bail-out of Wall Street and put his case for reforms of international financial institutions.</p> <p>Brown unexpectedly changed his itinerary after discussions with the White House, saying British families would want to know everything possible was being done to secure stability. The prime minister was in New York to attend the long-planned UN summit on the millennium development goals, but has increasingly found his agenda consumed by the turmoil in the markets, holding talks yesterday with leading Wall Street fund managers, Tim Geithner, the chairman of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, and even pulling together an informal summit of six world leaders in his hotel late on Wednesday night.</p> <p>Brown is likely to meet Bush for about 40 minutes and is expected to use the meeting to discuss the US request for extra British troops in Afghanistan, as well as the diplomatic fallout from the Russian invasion of Georgia.</p> <p>Insisting the Bush meeting had a practical purpose, Brown said: \"While the problem comes out of America, it has consequences for all of us and every family will want to know that we are doing everything in our power to ensure that there is stability; and that is stability for people's jobs, for people's mortgages, for people's standards of living.\"</p> <p>Brown, still suffering cabinet rumblings and poor polls, has been deploying his formidable knowledge of the financial markets to insist he is indispensable not just to his party but also the country.</p> <p>Since flying to New York on Wednesday, he has been lobbying for major reforms of financial institutions, claiming he was winning support for his idea of stronger international regulation based on common rules and standards.</p> <p>A report from the Swiss-based Financial Stability Forum - the premier international group of central bankers, finance ministries and regulators - is in line with Brown's thinking, also calling for some form of supervisory colleges for big global financial institutions.</p> <p>Brown also wants reform of credit rating agencies, bigger responsibility on banks' boards, reform of the bonus system and greater transparency on transactions. \"This set of events is making people realise that some of the things we proposed years ago, but we couldn't get consensus on, need to be done,\" he said.</p> <p>He was not supporting every detail of the bail-out plan but endorsed the principle of buying out worthless assets to restore liquidity. He was careful not give a view on whether Congress should place a cap on compensation for Wall Street executives who lose their jobs.</p> <p>Brown insisted that Britain was in better economic shape than the US: \"What's happening to the housing market is different, because there is still demand for housing in Britain but no flow of money - America has overbuilt houses and they now recognise that,\" he said.</p> <p>\"But it's different in the sense that President Bush's plan is about dealing with a wide range of institutions ... We in Britain have a smaller number of institutions.\" </p>",
  "<p>The battle against diseases like malaria is just one of eight broad Millennium Development Goals set out by the UN in 2000. Progress has fallen well short of targets, and Gordon Brown yesterday did not mince his words in castigating the world's \"shaming indifference\" to African poverty.</p> <p>He told the UN assembly in New York: \"Our greatest enemy is not war, inequality, or any single ideology, or any financial crisis, it is too much indifference. Indifference in the face of soul-destroying poverty, a catastrophic threat to our planet, a casual uncaring corrosive, pass-by-on-the-other side, walk-by, indifference.\"</p> <p>Britain, he said, was increasing its spending on eliminating infant mortality - another of the MDGs and one that his wife Sarah has campaigned on. He also pledged to spend almost $1bn over three years on maternal health, saying one mother a minute dies in childbirth. A report yesterday estimated that $7bn more would be needed to save the lives of 3 million mothers and 7 million newborns by 2015.</p> <p>The summit yesterday produced an extra $8bn in pledges from government and private sectors, covering a range of needs and not just malaria.</p> <p>Brown told the summit in New York to stick by its commitments in tough economic times: \"Some say a time of financial turbulence is the time to put our ambitions on hold, to cut back. This would be the worst time to turn back - every global problem we have requires global solutions involving all the continents of the world. Africa and the developing countries are not the problem, they are part of the very solutions to today's problems. </p> <p>\"The hungry are dying while we wait. We say we are one world, but every three seconds we allow one child to die from extreme poverty.\"</p>",
  "<p>A British artist walked free yesterday after being cleared of insulting Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish prime minister, by portraying him as a dog in a case seen as a test of Turkey's tolerance of free speech.</p> <p>A Turkish court acquitted Michael Dickinson of criminal charges despite citing \"some insulting elements\" in his depiction of Erdogan as a dog attached to a leash in the colours of the US flag. But the court ruled that the artwork was \"within the limits of criticism\".</p> <p>Dickinson, 58, who has lived in Turkey for 20 years, was charged with \"insulting the prime minister's dignity\" in September and could have faced up to two years in jail if convicted. He was arrested after unfurling the picture at a court hearing of an art exhibition organiser, who had been charged with insulting behaviour for displaying another of Dickinson's works. The earlier picture depicted Erdogan as a dog being presented with a rosette by George Bush. His acquittal may ease some pressure on Turkey from the EU, which called on Ankara to improve its record on human rights and freedom of speech issues as a condition of entry.</p> <p>Dickinson, a member of the Stuckist art movement, voiced relief at his acquittal but warned that other artists still faced legal pressure for expressing dissenting views. \"I am lucky to be acquitted. There are still artists in Turkey facing prosecution and being sentenced for their opinions,\" he told AP.</p> <p>The verdict ended a saga which has included four court hearings and seen Dickinson's fellow Stuckists calling first on Tony Blair and then Gordon Brown to intervene.</p> <p>Charges were pressed against Dickinson after he displayed his poster of Erdogan on a leash, which he called Good Boy, at the trial of Erkan Kara, organiser of an exhibition staged by the Global Peace and Justice Coalition, a campaign opposed to the US-led occupation of Iraq. Kara had been prosecuted after the exhibition showed Dickinson's earlier poster.</p> <p>Dickinson was forced to leave Turkey after his residence permit was cancelled but was charged when he returned on a tourist visa. After his arrest he spent 10 days in police detention during which an attempted escape was foiled when a pursuing police officer fired a gun at him.</p> <p>Dickinson, who was born in Durham, is not the first artist to have been prosecuted for allegedly insulting Erdogan. In 2005 the prime minister successfully sued a cartoonist who portrayed him as a cat tangled up in a ball of wool. Dickinson had earlier gained notoriety when his website was blanked by the host server for displaying a poster which showed Bush with a swastika on his right buttock and a cruise missile coming out of his rear.</p>",
  "<p>More than half of all frogs, toads and newts living in Europe could be driven to extinction within 40 years as climate change, diseases and habitat destruction take their toll, scientists warned last night.</p> <p>The majority of the most threatened species live in Mediterranean regions, which are expected to become warmer and drier. Island species, such as the Mallorcan midwife toad and Sardinian brook newt, are especially at risk because they are unable to move to cooler climates. </p> <p>In Britain, where viruses are already wiping out many hundreds of amphibians a year, conservationists fear for the future of the common toad, natterjack toad and crested newt.</p> <p>Researchers described the bleak outlook for Europe's amphibians at a meeting of the Zoological Society of London last night. Sir David Attenborough, who was due to attend the symposium, said: \"Amphibians are the lifeblood of many environments, playing key roles in the function of ecosystems, and it is both extraordinary and terrifying that in just a few decades the world could lose half of all these species.\"</p> <p>One in three of the world's amphibians are already on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's red list of endangered species, with some estimates suggesting 150 species have already become extinct since the 1980s.</p> <p>The expansion of towns and cities into natural habitats is chiefly to blame for the amphibians' precarious future, but many scientists believe climate change and diseases are acting together as a double whammy. \"A lot of European amphibians, especially those found in the Mediterranean, cannot move to find more suitable habitats, because they are surrounded by sea water, which they can't tolerate, or they are blocked off by mountain ranges,\" said Trent Garner, research scientist at the Zoological Society of London. </p> <p>Snakes, fish and birds that prey on the amphibians are already showing some signs of decline as the staple of their diet dies out. The disappearance of some amphibians is also expected to lead to a rise in insects and other creatures that amphibians feed on. \"Given that many of the things that amphibians eat are the things that destroy our crops or bite us and suck our blood, we might be feeling some of the effects a bit more directly than we've expected,\" said Garner.</p> <p>Ten years ago, scientists raised the alarm after finding vast numbers of amphibians were being wiped out by chytrid fungus, which infects the skin through which many of the animals drink and breathe. Scientists in Australia now suspect they have lost nine species to the infection.</p> <p>In recent decades chytrid fungus has spread rapidly, appearing almost everywhere there are amphibians. Some scientists believe the fungus has become more deadly as a result of climate change. One alarming case has been seen in the Pe\u00f1alara national park near Madrid, where the climate has become more humid and the fungus has caused mass mortality among amphibians. </p> <p>Garner and his colleagues based their assessment on published research into the effects of climate change on amphibian habitats, and believe more than 40 species could be extinct by 2050. One study showed that as global warming alters the climate in Europe, almost every amphibian habitat would be affected. \"It's horrifying to think that you can have a large group of organisms suffer such a catastrophic decline. Over 150 species may have gone extinct already in the past few decades and to me that is unacceptable,\" said Garner. </p> <p>In Britain, infections caused by a family of pathogens called ranaviruses, which emerged in the 1980s, are causing widespread deaths among some of the most common amphibians. \"When people find frogs in their gardens that look emaciated with sores all over their bodies, and quite often with toes missing, that is probably ranavirus,\" said Garner.</p> <p>Scientists at the meeting will emphasise the need to reduce the effects of climate change by reining in greenhouse gas emissions, but for many species that will come too late. In the short term, conservationists are urging zoos to set up captive breeding programmes for the most threatened amphibians.</p>",
  "<p>Ask Conservative MPs to name their party's greatest heroes and their instinctive respect for grandeur and historic achievement becomes immediately evident. Three of the four shortlisted finalists for the Guardian's Tory conference debate on Monday are prime ministers. </p> <p>As Benjamin Disraeli, one of the foursome, put it, they got to the \"top of the greasy pole\" - in exactly reverse proportion to the four picked by Labour MPs for last week's conference debate in Manchester, where the only prime minister to make the cut was Clement Attlee (1945-51). He came last in the final vote too. Labour's saintly founder, Keir Hardie, never even a minister, won easily.</p> <p>By contrast, Tory MPs have picked Disraeli, Winston Churchill, Margaret Thatcher (of course) and Edmund Burke (1729-97), philosophical hero of Anglo-American conservatism and society's \"little platoons\".</p> <p>On the conference fringe in Birmingham their champions will be David Willetts MP (Disraeli); Lord Kenneth Baker (Churchill); John Whittingdale MP (Thatcher); and Michael Gove (Burke). The audience will then vote.</p> <p>Yet the contrast with Labour is not all it seems. Closer inspection of the Tory shortlist reveals more respect - at least in retrospect - for unorthodoxy, romanticism, even recklessness among leaders than first glance suggests. </p> <p>All four were outsiders. Yes, Disraeli was twice prime minister of Victorian Britain at its global apex, briefly in 1868 and then 1874-80. Likewise Churchill, incarnation of the national will to resist Hitler in 1940-45.But what an exotic pair both were, and what rollercoaster careers they had, including rejection by their parties and unhappy stints at the Treasury before emerging with heroic status.</p> <p>Dizzy, son of a practising Jew (ineligible to vote), was a novelist with a rackety private life. Starting off a Radical politician, he never gave up trying to unite the landed aristocracy with the radical/working-class vote (the 1867 extension of the franchise was his bill) against bourgeois industrial interests.</p> <p>\"One Nation\" was Disraeli's phrase and he deployed social reform at home with romanticised imperialism abroad to court the patriotic working class. </p> <p>Churchill, who grew up in this era, never cast it off either. A Tory imperialist in action (cavalryman at the battle of Omdurman in 1898), then a reforming Liberal, ally of David Lloyd George, Churchill swung back to the Tories in the 1920s, never really trusted until they had to accept him in 1940.</p> <p>In his essay for theguardian.com, Lord Baker argues it was Churchill's judgment on the big issues - up to the \"Iron Curtain\" speech of 1946 - that justifies his status. For a man who also made so many bad calls (Gandhi being merely a \"half-naked fakir\" for one), that claim is certain to be challenged.</p> <p>David Willetts will argue that Disraeli's genius was to take Burke's organic view of society - in contrast to more grandiose visions in revolutionary France - and reshape the beaten Tories of the 1840s into election winners.</p> <p>Margaret Thatcher needs little introduction to a modern audience. The most dominant prime minister since Churchill in his warlord prime, by sheer force of will Thatcher also made herself a global figure out of all proportion to her country's residual weight. Yet she was not just the first woman to lead a modern G7 state, but one of modest social origins. She was the most improbable Tory leader since Disraeli. </p> <p>But Thatcher is English through and through, the only one of the Tory foursome able to make the claim. Churchill was half-American, as his enemies never forgot. Disraeli was a third-generation immigrant, a convert to Christianity.</p> <p>As for Burke, he too was an immigrant who metamorphosed from Irish Catholic stock into a metropolitan Englishman, albeit not a Tory but a Whig.</p> <p>Journalist, pamphleteer, political theorist, MP and minister (his least successful role), Burke sided with the American colonists in revolt - and turned prophetically against the excesses of the revolution in France. It would end in military dictatorship, Burke warned in 1790 when Napoleon was just another career officer. The dispute lost him many friends, including Thomas Jefferson. Yet it was Burke's belief in the moral basis of empire that proved a worm in the imperial bud that would lead to empire's dissolution.</p> <p>Churchill explained Burke's contradictions as those of a man opposed to tyranny where he saw it, in monarchs or the mob. But on Monday, Churchill and Burke will be on opposing sides.</p> <p>\u2022 Michael White chairs the Guardian debate on The Greatest Tory Hero on Monday September 29 from 6-7pm in Hall 5, the ICC, Broad Street, Birmingham</p>",

  "<p>The frame was set, the die cast. Treasury secretary Henry Paulson, presumably representing the Bush administration but indirectly representing Wall Street, and Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke, this week asked Congress for a cheque for at least $700bn to take bad debt off Wall Street's balance sheets. Never before in the history of US capitalism had so much been asked of so many for, at least in the first instance, so few. </p> <p>Put yourself in the shoes of a member of Congress, of either party. The two men charged with running the US economy - the treasury secretary and Fed chair - have told you a bailout of this size is necessary to save the economy. If you don't agree, they warn, you risk a meltdown of the entire global financial system - and your own constituents' savings could go down with it. </p> <p>A presidential election is six weeks away, but also an election for your seat. If you seek to stay in office, you are up for re-election. Oh, and one more thing: last week, when rumours circulated of the plan, the stock market gained substantial ground. This week, with less certainty about the plan's future, the market gyrated furiously.</p> <p>Congress had little choice but to say yes, and last night they appeared to, reaching a \"fundamental agreement\". Let's hope they also set some fundamental conditions on Wall Street.</p> <p>The public doesn't like the fact that this could be a blank cheque. They think this whole idea is nuts. They see fat cats on Wall Street who have raked in zillions for years, now extorting in effect $8,000 from every family to make up for their own nonfeasance, malfeasance, greed, and plain stupidity. This request came when most people were worried about their job and declining wages, and about having enough money to pay for gas and food and health insurance, to meet their car and mortgage payments, and save for their retirement and children's education. And so they asked: why should Wall Street get bailed out by me when I'm getting screwed?</p> <p>Put simply, they wanted strict conditions imposed on Wall Street. What sort? I've been urging the following five.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The government (that is, taxpayers) must receive an equity stake in every Wall Street financial firm proportional to the amount of bad debt it shoves on to the public. So when and if shares rise, taxpayers are rewarded for accepting so much risk.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Executives of Wall Street firms must relinquish stock options and this year's other forms of compensation, and agree to future compensation linked to a rolling five-year average of the firm's profitability. Why should taxpayers feather their already amply feathered nests?</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> All Wall Street executives must immediately cease making campaign contributions to any candidate for public office in this election cycle or next, all Wall Street public affairs committees (registered fundraising bodies) be closed, and Wall Street lobbyists curtail their activities unless specifically asked for information by policymakers. Why should taxpayers finance Wall Street's outsized political power - especially when that power is being exercised to get favourable terms from taxpayers?</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Wall Street firms must agree to comply with new regulations related to disclosure, capital requirements, conflicts of interest, and market manipulation. The regulations will emerge in 90 days from a bipartisan working group, to be convened immediately. After all, inadequate regulation and lack of oversight got us into this mess.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Wall Street must agree to give bankruptcy judges the authority to modify the terms of primary mortgages, so homeowners have a fighting chance to keep their homes. Why should they lose their homes when Wall Streeters receive taxpayer money that helps them keep their fancy ones?</p> <p>Wall Streeters may not like these conditions. That's too bad. They wanted the money; they should be made to accept them. Bailing out Wall Street's bad debts when millions of Americans can't pay their bills is like baling out a boat springing leaks while the sea is rising. Many of the average taxpayers being asked to take on Wall Street's bad loans are the same people whose incomes are dropping, which means they're struggling to pay their debts and potentially creating even more bad loans.</p> <p>Congress should not go soft on Wall Street. But Congress also needs to pay direct attention to what's happening in Main Street. It should extend unemployment insurance, freeze mortgage rates, and pass a stimulus package to create more jobs. Bottom line: unless Americans on Main Street have more money in their pockets, Wall Street's bad debts will continue to grow - which means no end in sight to the bailout of Wall Street.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Robert B Reich is professor of public policy at UC at Berkeley, author of Supercapitalism and was US secretary of labour under Bill Clinton from 1993-97, <a href=\"http://www.robertreich.org\">robertreich.org</a></p>",
  "<p>One of the strangest things about the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">financial crisis</a> is that anyone ever believed it wouldn't happen. For years, we now know, banks were lending money to people who couldn't afford it so they could buy houses that should never have been built. The banks then turned the mortgages on those houses into <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateralized_debt_obligations\">ever-more complex financial instruments</a> that are now nearly impossible to value. Then the banks sold all that bad debt all around the world and made sure they got into every nook and cranny of the global economy. <br> We're told that the US Congress and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson are close to a deal: they <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/25/wallstreet.useconomy\">have a working plan</a> that will give the Treasury that $700bn budget of taxpayer money to buy up all of those assets, that seem, clearly to anybody, to make no sense whatsoever. It seems impossible but, yes, there was a time \u2013 not that long ago \u2013 when these weird assets seemed entirely sensible (at least to some), and it was trivially easy to place a clear value on them. <br> In these overheated Fall days, it's worth going back to that period, roughly 2003 to early 2007, when all this insanity actually seemed to make some sort of sense. The world economy was acting in very odd ways. For the last several centuries, for the most part, most of the wealth in the world stayed in Europe, then started moving to the United States. Then some started popping up in Japan and Australia. Most of the rest of the world had almost nothing. Then, in a blink, this skewed balance of wealth suddenly changed. China joined the world trading system, oil prices hurtled upwards. The result: as <a href=\"http://www.thislife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?sched=1242\">we reported in this episode</a> of <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/\">This American Life</a> on <a href\"http: www.npr.org \">National Public Radio</a>, huge piles of money appeared in east Asia and a handful of oil-rich states, particularly in the Arab world and Russia. Suddenly, government bureaucrats and the instantly rich in these previously-poor emerging economies were looking for places to park their new-found money. <br> According to the IMF, in 2000 there were about $36tn in fixed-income investments. By 2007, that number had nearly doubled. There was twice as much money looking for investments, and there were not twice as many investments. That $70tn was looking for a home somewhere \u2013 anywhere on Earth \u2013 in which it stood a fair chance of finding a nice return. The problem was, hardly any market was growing fast enough to accommodate all that new money. Japan was stagnant; Europe was growing too slowly. The emerging economies that had received all this wealth from abroad simply didn't have many places to go.  There was one market, however, that seemed to be growing faster than any other: the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/subprimecrisis\">US sub-prime housing market</a>. <br> There is plenty of blame to go around, of course: out-of-date, slow-footed regulators, poor risk management at banks, a sometimes-compliant personal financial press pushing the idea of easy home ownership. We will spend the next few years assessing blame and punishing at least some of those responsible. But when you picture trillions of new dollars pouring into a market at a rate never before matched in history, it is a bit easier to understand how so many were able to convince themselves that everything was working just fine and why so few stopped to wonder: hey, does this make any sense?</p>",
  "<p>The world's leaders are gathering at the UN in New York this week to review progress towards the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/\">millennium development goals</a> set in 2000. The summit comes midway towards the 2015 target date for achieving the goals on global poverty, and politicians are already wringing their hands and raising their rhetoric in expectation. Gordon Brown, who has made much of his <a href=\"http://www.metacafe.com/watch/1297065/prime_minister_unveils_anti_poverty_plan/\">commitment to the cause</a>, is due to fly out at the end of the Labour conference.</p> <p>Look closer, however, and our leaders' failure to take action up to now leaves their words ringing hollow. Earlier suggestions that the number of people living in poverty had dipped below one billion have been discarded. <a href=\"http://econ.worldbank.org/external/default/main?menuPK=469435&amp;pagePK=64165236&amp;piPK=64165141&amp;theSitePK=469382\">New figures released by the World Bank</a> reveal that 1.4 billion people are now living in extreme poverty, or a quarter of the entire population of the developing world. This line is calculated according to what it means to be poor in the very poorest nations on earth, such as Mali, Chad, Rwanda, Ethiopia or Nepal. And the figures do not take into account the latest surge in poverty caused by rising food and fuel prices around the world, which have added at least another 100 million to the total.</p> <p>Such massive suffering in a world of plenty is a damning indictment of a political class that, for all its rhetoric, simply does not care enough to take the action needed to abolish global poverty. Even on the most optimistic projections, the world will still have over a billion people living in extreme want in 2015. The only saving grace is that China has managed, largely without outside help, to lift its huge population enough so that the global target of halving poverty levels may still be met by 2015. Take China out of the equation and the world is set to fall well short on all the main goals.</p> <p>UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon has <a href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=28013&amp;Cr=mdg&amp;Cr1=\">singled out rich countries</a> for failing to raise aid levels as promised, and he is right to point out the shortfall between their rhetoric and their record. The UK stands in the dock with others on this charge. Readers with long memories will recall Labour's pledge, while in opposition, that it would reach the UN aid target of 0.7% of gross national income by the end of its first term of office. After 11 years of a Labour government the figure now stands at just 0.36%, lower than it was when Labour was last in power in the 1970s.</p> <p>Yet it is quite wrong to believe that aid will solve the problems of global poverty. For this, far greater structural changes are needed at the international level. Trade rules must be rewritten to allow countries the freedom to develop their economies in their own long-term interests, not according to the predatory demands of European and US companies. This means putting an end to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/30/wto.india\">stalled Doha round</a> of world trade talks, which threaten to throw millions more into poverty. It also means halting the new <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/commission_barroso/mandelson/speeches_articles/sppm134_en.htm\">bilateral negotiations</a> that Peter Mandelson has launched with developing countries in his role as EU trade commissioner, which have the potential to be even more damaging.</p> <p>The world also needs a radical reorientation of finance flows in favour of development. Complete cancellation of third world debt remains a priority which is long overdue, given that developing countries still repay \u00a35 to the rich world for every \u00a31 they receive in aid. Action to curb corporate tax dodging is equally crucial. Developing countries are currently denied up to \u00a3250bn each year in taxes owed them by multinational corporations, and UN calculations show that such revenue would enable even the poorest countries to meet the millennium development goals.</p> <p>Some of these problems require global solutions. Yet much can be done at the national level, and Britain is well placed to take a lead. Many of the tax havens used by multinational corporations to rob poor countries of their dues are British territories such as the Cayman Islands and Bermuda, or crown dependencies such as Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man. The UK government could take immediate action against them over their role in facilitating corporate tax dodging, but has signally failed to do so. Similarly, a minimal stamp duty on sterling currency transactions could raise billions for the world's poorest countries, yet the Treasury has consistently rejected it.</p> <p>The New York summit offers one more opportunity for the international community to face up to its responsibilities in the fight against global poverty. Our political leaders must finally recognise that justice for the world's poor requires decisive action to change the global economic landscape. Sadly, for all the rhetoric, they are likely to offer us more of the same.</p>",
  "<p>John McCain today was accused of sabotaging the Wall Street bailout with theatrics that reduced America's credit crisis to a showcase for his presidential leadership capabilities.<br> The furious words for the Republican candidate from Democrats came after a contentious meeting at the White House between George Bush and congressional leaders that was meant to seal a deal on a $700bn economic rescue package.</p> <p>Both McCain and Barack Obama attended the meeting, along with congressional leaders.</p> <p>The extraordinary session had been called in part as a response to McCain's stunning announcement yesterday that he would suspend his presidential campaign and would seek a delay in tomorrow's presidential debate to try to personally help steer through a deal on the bailout.</p> <p>By midday today, congressional leaders said they had reached the outlines of a deal. But that optimism vanished after the White House meeting. </p> <p>Democrats and Republicans said that prospects for a deal vanished after McCain tried to prod his fellow Republicans in another direction. </p> <p>The breakdown cast new uncertainty over Friday night's presidential debate in Mississippi, as well as the future of the bailout itself. </p> <p>McCain said he would not attend the debate until a deal is reached. Obama said he would go to the debate, and the University of Mississippi, which is hosting the event said it planned to go ahead.</p> <p>Tonight, Democrats were scathing of the Republican's posturing, saying he had jeopardised efforts to unite Congress around the plan put forward by the treasury secretary, Henry Paulson. </p> <p>\"This is the presidential campaign of John McCain undermining what Hank Paulson tells us is essential for the country,\" said Barney Frank, the Massachusetts congressman who had been leading negotiations for the Democrats. \"This is McCain at the last minute getting House Republicans to undermine the Paulson approach.\"</p> <p>Obama also chided McCain. \"When you start injecting presidential politics into delicate negotiations you actually start creating more problems,\" he said.</p> <p>The anger and uncertainty about the bailout threatened to rebound against McCain's efforts to cast himself as above the political fray when it came to America's credit crisis. </p> <p>McCain had cast the bailout negotiations as a crisis requiring his personal attention. </p> <p>\"I'm an old Navy pilot, and I know when a crisis calls for all hands on deck,\" he said in a speech to the Clinton Global Initiative in New York before travelling to Washington. \"As of this morning I suspended my campaign. With so much on the line, for America and the world, the debate that matters most right now is taking place in the United States capitol - and I intend to join it.\"</p> <p>Obama continued to reject McCain's argument that the gravity of America's financial crisis should put the election campaign on hold. \"Our election is in 40 days,\" he said in his speech to the Clinton global initiative, delivered from Florida where he was preparing for the debate. </p> <p>\"The American people deserve to hear directly from myself and Senator McCain about how we intend to lead our country. The times are too serious to put our campaign on hold, or to ignore the full range of issues that the next president will face.\"</p> <p>However, it was widely noted that McCain did not even arrive in Washington until after Democratic and Republic leaders announced they had the outlines of a rescue package. <br> McCain admitted as recently as Tuesday that he had not taken the time to even read the bailout plan, according to an NBC interview transcript distributed by the Obama camp.</p> <p>But that did not stop the Republican from seizing the headlines for two days in a row. McCain first wrongfooted Obama yesterday with his stunning anouncement that he would suspend his campaign and would not attend the debate in Mississippi.</p> <p>Today, he struck again, appropriating Obama's conditions for the rescue deal - barely 24 hours after rejecting them.</p> <p>The Democrat had proposed the conditions during discussions with McCain yesterday about a joint statement from the presidential candidates about the financial crisis.</p> <p>In their proposals the Obama camp had called for an independent oversight board, a mechanism to protect taxpayers, a curb on outsized payments to Wall Street executives, and relief for homeowners faced with losing homes. The proposal for a joint statement also rejected attaching other measures, or earmarks, to the bill. </p> <p>In his speech today McCain adopted nearly identical language - as well as the essence of four of the five measures: an oversight board, protection for taxpayers, controls on compensation for Wall Street executives and a ban on earmarks. However, McCain made no mention of relief for homeowners. </p> <p>McCain's newfound sense of urgency for reaching a deal on the rescue package comes after a number of new polls suggesting that the economic crisis was costing the Republican support.</p>",

  "<p>One of Britain's leading mortgage lenders raised the cost of home loans today as a fortnight of turmoil in the global financial system pushed up the cost of borrowing for banks in the City's money markets.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/hsbcholdings\">HSBC</a> added to the pressure on an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/housingmarket\">already-weak housing market</a> when it raised mortgage rates by more than a quarter-point.</p> <p>The move reflected the growing strains in wholesale markets since the collapse of Lehman Brothers earlier this month. </p> <p>With banks hoarding cash and reluctant to lend to each other, the gap between the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/interestrates\">Bank of England's official bank rate</a> and the three-month sterling Libor rate - one of the keys to borrowing costs in the economy - widened to a level not seen since the start of the credit crunch more than 13 months ago. </p> <p>Similar stresses were evident today in euro and dollar Libor rates, both of which rose sharply.</p> <p>Threadneedle Street has pegged the bank rate at 5% since April, but three-month sterling Libor - the cost banks charge each other to borrow - rose to 6.27% in the City today. In the five years before money markets first froze up in August 2007, the average spread between bank rate and three-month Libor was less than 0.2 points.</p> <p>Rates in the money markets fell between July and early September, pushing down the cost of a two-year fixed rate mortgage to levels not seen since the start of the credit crunch. </p> <p>This led borrowers and consumer groups to hope that the market for mortgage finance was beginning to thaw. But wholesale markets have been badly shaken by this month's turbulence and borrowing rates have climbed sharply. </p> <p>Libor rates, which affect tracker mortgages have risen by around half a percentage point, while two-year swap rates, upon which fixed rate deals are based, have increased from 5.18% last week to 5.56% this week.</p> <p>Graham Turner of GFC Economics said: \"The fallout from the failure of Lehman Brothers continues to leave its mark. The collapse in counterparty confidence has driven Libor rates up to new highs.</p> <p>\"The repeated run-ups in Libor and swap spreads demonstrate that the financial crisis is getting deeper and that the proposed bail-out has merely bought a few days' grace.\"</p> <p>Nick Parsons, head of analysis at NAB Capital said: \"The gap between bank rate and three-month sterling Libor is higher than it has been at any time since before the collapse of Northern Rock a year ago. The Libor rate is the one which matters in the outside world because it applies to individuals, companies are public bodies. Anybody with a Libor-linked loan is seeing a fairly significant increase in borrowing costs.\"</p> <p>Parsons said that the injections of liquidity from the Bank of England, the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank meant banks had no trouble borrowing money overnight but that it was much harder to find banks prepared to lend for three-month periods. </p> <p>In London today, the Bank of England's cash auction was heavily over-subscribed by \u00a336bn, with banks preferring to borrow from Threadneedle Street rather than from each other.</p> <p>Parsons said the possibility of fresh bank failures and the desire to improve balance sheets had led to banks hoarding cash, which had driven up money-market rates. \"The current structure of interest rates is not consistent with anything we know, let alone fear, about the UK economy. It may be that interest rates will have to be cut dramatically to stop output from dropping significantly. It is a horrible state of affairs.\"</p> <p>Simon Ward, chief economist with New Star, the fund management group, said the Bank of England could help to ease the pressure on UK banks by cutting the fee charged for using its special liquidity scheme - a policy tool that allows banks to exchange mortgage-backed securities for gilts for a limited period. This would partially relieve upward pressure on banks' funding costs and, by extension, household and corporate borrowing rates.</p> <p>HSBC said it was increasing its fixed-rate deals for borrowers with just a 10% deposit by 0.3 points, while cutting fixed rate loans by 0.2 points for those putting down a 25% deposit. The bank added that it was reducing arrangement fees for people borrowing 90% of their home's value from \u00a3799 to \u00a3499, while fees for people taking out a 75% loan to value ratio would be \u00a3999.</p> <p>Other lenders are thought likely to raise their rates over the coming days.</p>",

It has never made a subnotebook (unless you count the Newton MessagePads and/or eMate), and the feature-deficient MacBook Air is bigger, heavier, and much more expensive that a typical netbook.</p> <p>Cult of Mac says:</p> <blockquote> <p>As a result, Rakesh lowered the target on Apple to $170 from $200 per share and fiscal fourth quarter estimates to $7.8 billion from $7.9 billion. <br>Apple's first fiscal quarter of 2009 will likely be $10.8 billion, down from the $11.5 billion previous estimated, according to the analyst.</p> </blockquote> <p>As <a href=\"http://blogs.barrons.com/techtraderdaily/2008/09/24/netbooks-vs-notebooks-thinkequity-sees-new-smaller-devices-eating-into-revenues-profits-at-apple-intel/\">Barron's</a> notes, Rakesh also cut his targets on Intel. It says:</p> <blockquote> <p>Intel is addressing the netbook market with its Atom processor, so the company is not being cut out of the food chain; but Rakesh notes that Atom processors sell at much lower price points and carry thinner gross margins. The Atom, he notes, sells for $20-$40 and carries a 45% gross margin, while the Core2Duo sells for $140-$250 and carries a gross margin of 56%.</p> </blockquote> <p>Microsoft is in a similar position. The top netbooks on Amazon's list are running Windows XP (the first Linux machine is at No 7), but Microsoft probably makes about half as much on a ULCPC deal as it would if someone bought a Vista laptop.</p> <p>Still, it would not be wise to get hysterical about this. First, Amazon is a very poor guide to what people are actually buying (which is Dell and HP notebooks, as a matter of fact). It could easily be affected by Mac buyers buying more from Apple or Apple stores instead of from Amazon.</p> <p>Second, it's not yet clear how many people are buying netbooks instead of mainstream laptops, rather than as second or third machines. If they're substitutes, suppliers are taking a hit; but if they are incremental sales, they're benefiting. I expect it's a bit of both\u2026.</p> <p>It's much like the shift from desktops to laptops, and as I pointed out <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/mar/27/computing.subnotebooks\">back in March</a>, suppliers just have to do well enough for the extra sales from new platforms to outweigh the lost sales from old ones. \"That's not necessarily easy, but nor is it the end of the world.\"</p>",

  "<p>World leaders today announced an ambitious plan to end all malaria deaths by 2015, backed by unprecedented funding of nearly $3bn (\u00a31.6bn) from donors including the World Bank and the Gates Foundation.</p> <p>A key part of the strategy is the introduction of a vaccine against the deadly disease, which is now just entering the final stage of trials. Although the vaccine is expected to be only partially effective, it will still save thousands of lives.</p> <p>A donation of $168.7m from Bill Gates ensures that scientists will go on to develop further vaccines in the hope, eventually, of being able to give total immunity to all babies in affected countries soon after birth.</p> <p>The announcement at a UN special summit on the millennium development goals in New York attended by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, together with the presidents of Rwanda and Tanzania, prime minister Gordon Brown and other leaders, sets the bar in the fight against malaria higher than ever before. </p> <p>With tools that are now proven to work, such as long-lasting insecticide-impregnated bed nets, indoor spraying against malarial mosquitoes and new drugs as well as the expected vaccine, it is now hoped not only to bring malaria under control by 2010 but to eliminate deaths.</p> <p>Gordon Brown called the strategy launch \"a real and vital turning point\" which \"brings together a new coalition of forces - government, the private sector and NGOs - to ensure we all rise to the challenge of eradicating malaria deaths by 2015.\" </p> <p>One million people, mainly children under five and pregnant women, die every year of malaria, most of them in Africa. </p> <p>The largest slice of the new money comes from the Global Fund to fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria, which has approved $1.62bn in country grants over two years and then the World Bank, which is putting $1.1bn into Africa over three years. </p> <p>The Bank is focusing especially on Democratic Republic of Congo and Nigeria, where 30-40% of all malaria deaths take place. Group president Robert B Zoellick said that endemic malaria also has serious financial consequences for families. </p> <p>\"Malaria preys on the poor and keeps them poor. Poverty prevents people from buying bed nets to prevent malaria and medicine to cure it,\" he said. </p> <p>\"When people are struck by the disease, parents miss work, children miss school and malaria emergencies plunge families into debt from which they can't recover.\"</p> <p>Bed nets, sprays and artimisinin drugs, derived from the Chinese wormwood plant, have all helped bring malaria rates down in some smaller countries, but a vaccine could have the biggest impact. </p> <p>The one about to enter final trials in 16,000 babies aged 5 to 17 months in a number of countries, seven of them in Africa, is the result of a public/private partnership by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals with the backing of the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI). It has been shown to reduce malaria cases by 30% and halve the numbers of children getting severe malaria.</p> <p>Christian Loucq, director of MVI, said the new vaccine, currently known only as RTS,S, could be available by 2013, if it is swiftly approved by the European licensing authority and then the World Health Organisation, as seems likely. </p> <p>But the new money from the Gates Foundation is a recognition of MVI's plans to engage researchers on the development of an even better vaccine. </p> <p>\"I'm very hopeful that the malaria vaccine currently in advanced testing will be proven effective, but that will just be the first step,\" said Bill Gates. \"Now it's time to develop a new generation of vaccines that are even more effective and could someday eradicate malaria altogether.\"</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown today told the emergency UN summit on the Millennium Development Goals that the world had to face the shameful truth that corrosive indifference by rich nations was in danger of leaving millions in poverty in Africa for another 100 years. </p> <p>In a powerful speech to the special UN summit on meeting the goals, the prime minister urged a redoubling of efforts to raise the funds to meet the big threats of hunger, malaria, infant mortality and lack of universal education. </p> <p>The summit, attended by world leaders, businessmen including Bill Gates, and rock stars such as Bono, was convened to galvanise efforts to get the world back on track to meeting the ambitious goals, due to be achieved by 2015. </p> <p>The summit has had the effect of producing an extra $8bn in pledges, from governments and the private sector, but still not enough to meet the goals. </p> <p>Gates, announcing that his eponymous charitable foundation was releasing another $169m for research into new malaria vaccines, urged the summit not to collapse into despair in the face of evidence that many goals will be missed.<br> He said: \"Disappointing is not dispiriting. It is not surprising we do not get perfect grades so I disagree with those that only focus only on the disappointment and try to spread around blame. People are not motivated by blame - people are motivated by success and we have had many successes.\" </p> <p>Gates argued that innovation would bring progress on malaria vaccines and on drought-resistant maize. </p> <p>Brown urged world leaders not to use the credit crunch as an excuse to abandon pledges made by the UN back in 2000, with the world only half way to the 2015 deadline. </p> <p>He told the summit: \"Some say a time of financial turbulence is the time to put our ambitions on hold, to cut back or to postpone the dream of achieving the millennium development goals. </p> <p>\"This would be the worst time to turn back - every global problem we have requires global solutions involving all the continents of the world. Africa and the developing countries are not the problem they are part of the very solutions to today's problems.\"</p> <p>The greatest threat, Brown argued, was not war, inequality or financial crisis but indifference: \"The hungry are dying while we wait. We say we are one world but every three seconds we allow one child to die from extreme poverty\". </p> <p>He said the world had to face the shameful truth that despite all the promises, the millennium development goal on infant mortality would not be met by 2050, let alone 2015.<br> At current progress, he added, the promise of free education would not be met before 2100. He said: \"I say to the richest countries of the world, 'The poorest countries have been patient but 100 years is too long to wait for justice. So to make poverty history we need to make new history today and make it happen now.\"</p> <p>The UN summit has agreed a series of new goals, including trying to recruit and train 1 million health workers and save the lives of 3 million mothers by 2015, and to end all malaria deaths by the same date.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bradfordbingley\">Bradford &amp; Bingley</a> is axing hundreds of jobs after demand for mortgages plummeted, but hiring more people to chase bad debts on existing loans.</p> <p>In a more that fuelled speculation of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/23/bradfordbingley.banking\">a takeover</a>, the Yorkshire-based lender announced this morning that 370 positions are being cut in a streamlining move as it dramatically reduces its lending business.</p> <p>It also announced losses of \u00a3134m, having sold off toxic Treasury assets.</p> <p>B&amp;B is making all 50 of its remaining branch mortgage advisers redundant, having already axed 90 earlier this year.

  "<p>The global credit crunch has hit one of the stalwarts of the American economy, with General Electric - the only one of the original dozen constituents of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) that is still there 112 years later - warning that it has not been immune from the turmoil.</p> <p>The world's fourth-largest company blamed \"unprecedented weakness and volatility in the financial services markets\" for its decision to cut its profit forecasts and refusal to raise its dividend payment to shareholders for the first time since the 1970s, as it looks to shore up its finances.</p> <p>The conglomerate - which spans energy, healthcare, financial services and media - stressed that it is financially sound and its financial business will outperform all its peers in 2008. But the group, which can trace its heritage back to the invention of the electric light by Thomas Edison, dropped its profit forecast for the third quarter by about 16% and for the full year by 12%, or over $2bn (\u00a31bn).</p> <p>\"GE anticipates that difficult conditions in the financial services markets are not likely to improve in the near future,\" it said in a statement. Shares in GE, which have lost about a third of their value over the past few months after the company first warned on profits in April, were down in early Wall Street trading.</p> <p>Its GE Capital financial unit spans commercial loans, home loans, insurance, credit cards and personal loans. Those operations accounted for over half the group's profits last year but has been caught up in the rising tide of repossessions and defaults that is sweeping across America as house prices collapse.</p> <p>To reduce the risk in the business and help improve its liquidity at a time when the world's money markets are seizing up, GE Capital will be allowed to retain more of its profits. GE has also called a halt to its $15bn share buyback programme to retain cash.</p> <p>GE, which owns TV and film group NBC Universal as well as financial business GE Capital, said it now expects profits for the third quarter to be $0.43 to $0.48 per share, down from its original forecast of $0.50 to $0.54.</p> <p>For 2008 as a whole, GE, expects to make profits of between $19.5bn to $21bn - or $1.95 to $2.10 per share. That new forecast is down from its previous estimate of annual profits between $22bn to $23bn or $2.20 to $2.30 per share. Wall Street had been forecasting that the company would make about $0.52 per share in the third quarter and $2.21 per share for the entire year.</p> <p>GE stressed that GE Capital does not need to raise funds, but the changes in the cash that the business pays to the group means the ratio of earnings that the group as a whole makes from its industrial business compared with financial business will change to 60/40 by the end of 2009.</p> <p>As a result of the injection of more cash into the financial business, the group's board has voted to maintain its dividend payout for next year at current levels, making 2009 the first time the payout has not increased for 32 years. </p> <p>Chairman and chief executive Jeff Immelt said: \"We run the company for the long term... Given the recent dramatic developments in the financial markets, we have made some tough decisions to further reduce risk and strengthen our balance sheet while maintaining our dividend commitment.\"</p> <p>\"We have suspended the stock buyback to reduce GE Capital leverage, while still being able to pursue opportunistic acquisitions.\"</p> <p>\"Our industrial business fundamentals remain very strong, with continued global strength in our core industries,\" he added. \"While the financial services markets remain challenging and require us to adapt quickly to the rapidly changing environment, we will continue to run GE Capital to be safe and secure, while earning high margins on conservatively underwritten business.\"</p> <p>GE is known as one of the bellwethers of the US economy. It was formed through the merger of Thomas Edison's Edison General Electric Company and rival firm Thomson-Houston Electric Company. That deal, in 1892, was orchestrated by one of Wall Street's biggest names, John Pierpont Morgan - whose eponymously named bank last year scooped up rival Bear Stearns at the start of the credit crisis.</p> <p>The General Electric Company was one of the 12 companies that appeared in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, when the list of America's most important businesses was first published in May 1896.

  "<p>It's assessment time, the halfway stage, for the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/\">Millennium Development Goals</a>. Agreed at the United Nations in 2000, the target date for achieving the vast ambition of ending global poverty is 2015. Although there have been spectacular successes, particularly in south east Asia, there has been only slow and patchy progress elsewhere, while in sub-Saharan Africa, and in some former Soviet republics, the number of people in poverty has actually risen.</p> <p>Today, 100 heads of government are meeting in New York to work out what needs to be done to boost the chances of reaching the <a href=\"http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mdg/Resources/Static/Products/Progress2008/MDG_Report_2008_En.pdf#page=46\">eight goals</a> that have been built around livelihoods, health and education.</p> <p>Mid-global financial crisis, it's likely to be a lot harder than in 2005 to persuade donor countries to up the amount of aid they make available. It's already fallen from the all-time record of $107bn reached that year, to $104bn. Overseas aid always gets hard to sell when the going gets tough at home.</p> <p>But that's not the only reason why support may weaken, despite the commitment of the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon. The idea of setting fixed and prescriptive goals \u2013 with subsidiary targets that are supposed to offer waymarks to the final destination \u2013 has been controversial from the start, and evidence from the field in some cases backs up the scepticism.</p> <p>The goals were established as global targets. But they are delivered, and measured (not always reliably), within individual countries. Some observers question whether the goals are <a href=\"http://www.odi.org.uk/publications/briefing-papers/19-aid-allocation-mdgs.pdf \">distorting aid allocation</a>, so that money goes to one country, or one project, that might be used more effectively \u2013 judged by poverty alleviation \u2013 in another.</p> <p>In particular, the individual targets are feared to be damagingly prescriptive. That could mean that money is diverted from the chronically to the merely slightly poor. And while early progress might be highly efficient in terms of aid use, striving, for example, to engage the last few per cent of children in full-time education could be disproportionately costly. Hence the new mantra: targets should be taken \"seriously, but not literally\". </p> <p>Economists might invent some different way of measuring progress towards the targets that would allow more flexibility. But the greatest asset of the MDGs is their simplicity and their clarity. They have been invaluable as a way of focusing global attention and vision in high-level politics \u2013 as this week's high level summit shows again \u2013 and mobilising public support and resources.</p> <p>But that is more true for the rich north than the poor south. In some developing countries, there is resentment at what's seen as the external imposition of targets that may not reflect local needs or desires. Insecurity \u2013 from civil war to theft and rape \u2013 is a fundamental cause of poverty, but it is not addressed at all by the MDGs.</p> <p>Care International, in its <a href=\"http://www.careinternational.org.uk/11640/media-releases/global-aid-reform-summit-must-tackle-conflict-or-millions-will-lose-out-on-the-millennium-development-goals-.html\">recent report</a> pointed out how vulnerable countries in conflict are. One in three child deaths and 29% of 12-year-olds who fail to complete primary school in developing countries live in so-called \"fragile\" states. Nearly one third of the world's poorest people live in countries in conflict, and progress on the goals to reduce extreme poverty and cut maternal mortality has gone backwards.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.odi.org.uk/publications/annual-report/2008-article-mdgs.pdf\"> Overseas Development Institute</a> wants to develop the idea of the social protection, where humanitarian aid and development are woven together more closely. The real anxiety \u2013 when no country has yet reached the north's only MDG target of spending 0.7% of GDP on aid \u2013 is that in a climate of economic crisis, funding will fall more sharply.</p> <p>Without renewed and redirected aid and energy, the MDGs will fail. Failure not only condemns millions to preventable illness and early death, it will also make it harder to engage and motivate the developed world in renewing its efforts.</p> <p><em>This article has been cross-posted from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/2008/sep/25/aidanddevelopment.news\">here</a>, but is open to comments only in this location.

  "<p>A grouse moor owner hit by the largest ever financial penalty under farming legislation because illegal pesticides were found on his estate has denied any involvement in wildlife crime.</p> <p>The Guardian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/22/wildlife.conservation\">revealed on Monday</a> that John Dodd had lost \u00a3107,650 from his farming subsidies after police found a highly toxic and illegal compound of pesticides on alleged bait and equipment during a raid on his estate in Tayside in 2006.</p> <p>The money is being deducted by the Scottish executive under European Union regulations because of suspicions the pesticides \u2013 including one chemical never legally available in the UK \u2013 was used to target legally protected birds of prey on his estate. </p> <p>However, no member of the estate's staff has been charged or prosecuted over the discoveries of poisoned baits, pesticides residues on game bags and on soil and plant samples. </p> <p>Dodd, the co-founder of the Artemis fund management group, has confirmed he is appealing against the decision.</p> <p>\"I am disappointed that this action has been taken and I am puzzled by the decision when no one has been charged,\" he told the Daily Telegraph.</p> <p>\"But I am abiding by the rules and I have lodged an appeal. I believe we have a very good case. My aim at Glenogil is to restore the grouse moor habitat, which has widespread benefits for all sorts of wildlife.</p> <p>\"I have every faith in my gamekeepers and my staff are constantly receiving training in all aspects of good practice and grouse management. I hope this issue can be resolved as soon as possible.\"</p> <p>Dodd said the \u00a3107,650 penalty had not yet been deducted since his appeal was pending. However, The Guardian understands the money has already been withheld from his 2007 single farm payment grant, paid out on August 8.</p> <p>The Scottish executive's decision also has been questioned by the Scottish Rural Property and Business Association and the Scottish Countryside Alliance. </p> <p>They said such punishments can only be made if the offence was proven to the same standard as in a criminal conviction. The pesticides finds in this case were detected by the Scottish Agricultural Sciences Agency laboratory, the official agency used in pesticides abuse prosecutions.</p>",

  "<p>Gordon Brown is to fly to Washington tomorrow for emergency talks on the international financial crisis with his US counterpart, George Bush, at the White House. </p> <p>The unscheduled talks follow the British prime minister's announcement today that he is publicly backing the controversial US $700bn plan to bail out Wall Street, saying action was required to \"get these bad assets out of the system as quickly as possible\".</p> <p>Speaking in New York, where he is meeting a series of world leaders <br>to discuss both the credit crunch and efforts to meet the UN's millennium development goals, Brown said the financial package, set to be considered by Congress, was vital to restore stability.</p> <p>The prime minister is finding his trip to the UN general assembly increasingly diverted towards the financial crisis, although he is also trying to make sure his original agenda of extra cash for Africa from both public and private sector is not squeezed out altogether. Brown is hoping to hear an extra \u00a37bn in commitments. </p> <p>He held a breakfast today with 19 big asset fund managers from Wall Street at the Waldorf Hotel, including chief executives from Goldman Sachs and George Soros, head of Soros Fund Management. Unlike Brown, Soros is opposed to the bail-out plan proposed by the US treasury secretary, Henry Paulson. </p> <p>But Brown said: \"It is necessary to get these bad assets out of the system as quickly as possible. We need to make sure we stabilise the financial system immediately. </p> <p>\"We support and welcome the American Resolution Trust Corps. Let us make sure this never happen again. It is important that we support the American action.\" </p> <p>Brown said he was not going to discuss Congressional opposition to aspects of the plan, including the limit on salaries earned by executives whose companies benefit from it. \"It is a matter of detail to be worked out by the authorities,\" he said. </p> <p>He also claimed that many world leaders at informal meetings with him yesterday supported his plan for greater international supervision, largely based on proposals being mapped out by the financial stability forum, a group of bankers, regulators and treasury officials from more than 30 countries.</p> <p>Brown discussed the plan last night with leaders, including<br>Spanish prime minister Jose Zapatero, European commission president Jose Barrroso, Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd, Brazilian president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and Danish prime minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen. </p> <p>The prime minister is fighting for a multi-part package but has no meeting scheduled with senior US Treasury figures as they battle in Washington over the bail-out package.</p> <p>Brown has called for international regulation, greater transparency and responsibility in executive bonuses to encourage longer-term decision making. He believes the IMF, working with the Financial Stability Forum - a group of central banks, regulators and international bodies - \"should be at the heart of an early warning system for financial turbulence affecting the global economy\". The forum is due to report on a proposal in autumn.</p> <p>He has also been privately testing the water to see whether there are grounds for restarting world trade talks in the near future.</p> <p>Initial polls suggest Brown's standing in the polls has been boosted by his promise in his Labour party conference speech this week to be a rock of stability in the credit crisis. </p> <p>He will, however, be aware that the economy can swing votes massively, and will have witnessed the Democratic presidential candidate, Barack Obama, enjoying a poll surge as the Republicans suffer from the incumbency factor.</p> <p>Brown insists he has done everything he needed to increase liquidity in UK markets, and privately complains the crisis could have been minimised had his proposals on international regulation been implemented earlier.</p> <p>He says his form of risk-based regulation has worked, but the scale of the new financial instruments outwitted the regulators.</p> <p>Brown is concerned the costs of the credit crisis, as well as the economic down turn, will mean the developed world turns off the tap on funding to alleviate poverty. He has been working on ambitious packages on education, health and eradicating deaths from malaria by 2015.</p>",
  "<p>Ireland has become the first country in the eurozone to slip into recession, official figures showed today.</p> <p>According to the Central Statistics Office, the country's once-booming economy shrank by 0.3% in the first quarter of the year and by 0.5% in the second. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/may/02/businessglossary\">The technical definition of a recession</a> is two or more consecutive quarters of contraction. The European commission thinks that Germany and Spain could be next.</p> <p>Britain is also teetering on the brink of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/recession\">recession</a>. Andrew Sentance, a member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, said last night all the \"evidence suggests that the economy could start to contract in the second half of this year or in early 2009, giving us one or more quarters of negative growth over this period\".</p> <p>But he added that the downturn was likely to be \"much milder\" than the last major recessions in the mid-1970s, early-1980s and early-1990s, during which economic activity slumped for one to two years.</p> <p>Another MPC member, Kate Barker, warned today: \"The latest developments in financial markets have now increased the downside risks. There are real dangers that the impact of these will be a downturn in the economy which is unnecessarily large, and would therefore result in a large undershoot of the inflation target.\" She predicted lending by UK banks would remain constrained for a \"considerable period\". </p> <p>Dubbed the Celtic Tiger during the late 1990s, the Irish economy is now facing its toughest time since being hit by high unemployment and emigration in the 1980s.</p> <p>\"All in all, it is clear that the Irish boom has well and truly turned to bust. And with the European Central Bank fretting about inflation concerns elsewhere in the euro zone, there is little help on the immediate horizon,\" said Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics. He reckons that house prices, which have tumbled 14% from their peak, have much further to fall.<br> Ireland's finance department pointed to the crumbling property market and the global credit crunch as key factors. A spokesman said: \"As expected, lower levels of new housebuilding had a major restraining influence on growth in the second quarter, as is evident from the very weak investment figures. Other factors at work include higher commodity prices, global financial market problems, weak demand in our major trading partners and adverse exchange rate movements.\" </p>",
  "<p>It has long been a proud characteristic of British broadcasting that it provides programmes dedicated to the pursuit of public purposes, as well as commercial fare. However, the arrangements that have made this possible are collapsing in the face of the revolution currently engulfing the media. The communications regulator, <a href=\"http://www.ofcom.org.uk/\">Ofcom</a>, was asked to find a solution to this problem. To the surprise of many, it seems to be succeeding. To the surprise of perhaps even more, the key to its rescue plan has turned out to be what looks at first sight like a blow to the BBC.</p> <p>In the course of a still <a href=\"http://www.ofcomorg.uk/consult/condocs/psb2_1/\">ongoing review</a> of public service broadcasting, Ofcom identified four possible strategies. One of these was to make the BBC the sole provider of public interest material. Much of the broadcasting establishment saw this as the only real runner, arguing that in a more hostile environment concentration on one trusted institution would be the only reliable solution. Yet in its report on the <a href=\"http://www.ofcom.org.uk/media/news/2008/09/nr_20080925\">second phase of the review</a>, published today (25 September), Ofcom has ruled this option out, while keeping modified versions of the other three on the table.</p> <p>The authority insists that plurality of provision is essential. It cites the need for diversity of voice, extensive reach and creative competition. Experience of the way public service broadcasting has operated up till now supports this case. </p> <p>Until ITV opened for business in 1955, the BBC was virtually the only provider of public service broadcasting (or indeed of any other kind) in Britain. Though committed to impartiality, it inevitably developed its own interpretation of this obligation. Notoriously, after the general strike of 1926, the first director general, John Reith, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Uncertain-Vision-Birt-Dyke-Reinvention/dp/0436205629\">told</a> staff that \"since the government in this crisis was acting for the people ... the BBC was for the government.\"</p> <p>People who found the corporation's tone and style off-putting or its discourse impenetrable had nowhere else to look for broadcast information or enlightenment. Above all, however, producers were under no pressure to excel at what they did. This was the era when newsreaders wearing black ties told the populace that nothing much had happened which need concern them, and political interviewers asked politicians if there was anything they'd care to share with the nation.</p> <p>ITV shook things up. Its more demotic voice brought public affairs, arts and educational programmes to a new audience. It was sharper and less deferential to the establishment. And its contribution forced the BBC to raise its game. The arrival of Channel 4, committed as it was to innovation, raised the level of Britain's public service broadcasting even further.</p> <p>Now that market forces are stripping the BBC's rivals of the capacity to provide public interest material, the key driver of quality is disappearing. TV producers are just like the rest of us. When they're protected by monopoly status, they rest on their laurels. Those making public interest programmes are free from the discipline imposed by the ratings on their counterparts making popular shows. So, why bother trying too hard, and why go out of your way to offend the powerful, if you have no rivals to show you up?</p> <p>Ofcom's stewardship of public service broadcasting has been much <a href=\"http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/news/display.var.2431981.0.0.php?act=complaint&amp;cid=1851713\">criticised</a>. Yet its new-found insistence that the BBC mustn't stand alone in this field seems to have won general assent, albeit grudging in some quarters. The question now is where the money will come from to replace what the market will no longer provide. On this, Ofcom has yet to pronounce. For the moment, the industry is trying to persuade itself that not much cash will be needed, and that what will be needed can be conjured from some obscure corner without anyone noticing.</p> <p>At a recent question-and-answer session organised by the Royal Television Society, Ofcom's chief executive, <a href=\"http://www.ofcom.org.uk/about/csg/ofcom_board/biogs/e_richards/\">Ed Richards</a>, insisted that any new arrangements should leave the BBC's \"core\" programme and services budget secure. Asked afterwards to explain which programmes and services were core and which were not, he said he hadn't studied the matter.</p> <p>Soon, we may all have to. And the BBC could emerge from this process much improved, if smaller. Paradoxically, being required to disgorge cash to fund rivals could force it to rediscover its real mission.</p>",
  "<p>John Travolta is the latest Hollywood A-lister to be seduced by Europacorp, the French company set up by Fifth Element director Luc Besson to churn out high octane action movies. He will appear in the thriller From Paris With Love which is shooting in a suburb of the French capital.</p> <p>Travolta plays an American secret agent who crosses path with a young embassy worker - to be played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers - while on a high-risk mission in the French capital, Variety <a href=\"http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117992789.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1\">reports</a>.</p> <p>Besson's firm has graduated in recent years from using actors such as Jason Statham (on the Transporter series) to bigger names. Most recently it produced the Liam Neeson revenge thriller Taken, about an ex special-ops agent who turns Paris upside down in his efforts to save his kidnapped daughter from being sold as a sex slave by evil Algerians. Pierre Morel, who directed that film, which hits UK cinemas tomorrow, will also take charge of From Paris With Love.</p> <p>It's all a long way from Besson's own The Fifth Element, his sprawling, supremely ambitious 1997 sci-fi epic starring Bruce Willis in stereotypical save-the-world mode. But the Frenchman said two years ago that he no longer wanted to direct, preferring to devote himself to civic projects instead.</p> <p>\"I want to take a little care of my fellow citizens,\" he said at the time. \"I want to take a little care of my planet. I want to act in favor of the inner cities, in favour of the environment. I want to do lots of things.\"</p> <p>One of those things, on current form, seems to be producing old-school balls-out action films set in France but starring Hollywood A-listers.

  "<p>Rowan Williams' <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/25/religion.creditcrunch\">attack on global capitalism</a> makes great headlines \u2013 \"'Marx was right' says Archbishop\" \u2013 but it also reveals one of his deepest convictions. He really thinks modern globalised capitalism is something evil. Of course he is not a great one for rhetoric of this kind; but his recent <a href=\"http://www.baylor.edu/baylorpress/index.php?id=25827&amp;Book_ID=172\">book</a> on Dostoevsky, and especially his treatment of Dostoevsky's great novel of nihilism, <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/8117\">The Devils</a>, suggests very powerfully that he thinks Dostoevsky would have seen modern capitalism as a work of the devil, and that he thinks Dostoevsky was right. </p> <p>He hates the consumerist ideology of limitless choice because he thinks it tears us way from our real and limited wants; and he sees it prefigured in some of Dostoevsky's villains, for whom \"Everything depends on choice, and what is chosen today need have no relation to what is chosen tomorrow or what is chosen by anyone else\". Reading these words detached from their context, it's obvious that they are also the perfect description of the workings of an untrammelled market, which may go <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/09/freddiemacandfanniemae.subprimecrisis1\">up</a>, <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/business/2008/09/banks-financial-paulson-public\">down</a>, or merely sideways depending entirely on the free choices of participants today. For Williams such a market is dehumanising and by extension diabolical:</p> <blockquote> <p>What is depicted as The Devils moves towards its conclusion is the process by which the elevation of choice increasingly produces an evacuation of desire.</p> </blockquote> <p>Bruce Springsteen put it in rather fewer words: \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5scpDev1qps\">57 channels and nothing on</a>\".</p> <p>You get the impression that the archbishop believes that hell is a place which shows American television everywhere and all the time. That's not in the shallow sense that hell is meant to be a place of torment, and it would be very horrible to watch cheap TV all the time, but in the much deeper sense that television destroys any idea of the sacred, or the truly important: the villains in the The Devils are \"radically incapable of recognising any authority or significance in the images they literally and figuratively deface. They will make an obscene or belittling joke of suffering, of suicide ... they mock the bereavement of people ... they seek to inhabit a world in which nothing is serious, in which nothing, that is to say, signifies, opens unexpected horizons, or suggests a narrative larger than that of themselves as rootless individuals\".</p> <p>This, he would say, is sinful in the precise sense that it draws us away from the sight or experience of God: that is also his interpretation of the famous phrase that \"If God does not exist, then everything is permitted\". He doesn't think that this is about the consequences if one less thing (God) is shown to exist; nor even that no punishment for evil can be trusted without God to enforce it in the afterlife. No \u2013 his argument is that if God does not exist \"we are no longer able to see violence against others as somehow blasphemous, an offence against an eternal order [and] there is nothing definably insane about taking one's own life\".</p> <p>Williams's real objection to the market is that it turns its participants into things to one another \u2013 and that, he believes, is a blasphemy because we are not things, but, in some sense, images of God. Money allows us to treat other as impersonal means to an end, and this offends both his reactionary and his socialist instincts profoundly. In 19th-century Russian literature, it is almost always nobler to be a serf than a wage-slave. Though the relationship between a serf and his master is based ultimately on violence, it is personal violence, not the impersonal and invisible transaction of the market, and so it has more room for virtue, and for growth. </p> <p>That's a real difference from Marx, who had no doubt that we could treat slaves as things just as easily as wage-slaves. </p> <p>On the other hand, Williams can sound entirely Marxist when he attacks the introduction of markets into the NHS as he does towards the end of the book. To turn nurses into \"producers\" of health care for \"customers\" is to remove the culture of nursing from the activity altogether, he says. It stops being a gesture of selflessness, carried out in response to an ethical imperative, and becomes instead a set of negotiations for advantage, and if neither side sees any advantage in it, then there's no reason to nurse anyone at all: \"When such contracts cease to be satisfactory, there is no relation left; the other has ceased to be properly instrumental to my will and can be safely discarded\".</p> <p>There's a great deal that could be said about Williams's particular critique of the markets: although he's a very clever man, I don't suppose he knows any more about economics than all the other very clever people currently bewildered by the question \"What should we do?\"; and to know that the archbishop supports a ban on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/shortselling\">short-selling</a> doesn't make it much clearer that this ban is a good thing.</p> <p>But the one thing you can't say is that this is a knee-jerk response, or a piece of publicity seeking. The belief that capitalism tends towards evil is one of his deepest convictions.</p>",

  "<p><strong>Goal one: Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger</strong></p> <p><strong>Aim:</strong> To halve the proportion of people living on less than a $1 a day, and to halve the proportion of people suffering from hunger, to achieve full and productive employment and ensure everyone has access to decent work, including women and young people.<br><strong>Progress:</strong> The UN is optimistic that halving the proportion of people living on less than a $1 a day can be achieved by 2015, although this is largely fuelled by the huge strides being made in Asia. Little progress has been made in reducing extreme poverty in sub-Saharan Africa. The latest estimates by the World Bank put the number of people living in extreme poverty in the developing world higher than previously thought, due to the new threshold to measure extreme poverty rising from $1 to $1.25 to account for purchasing power parity.</p> <p>The proportion of people suffering from malnutrition and hunger has fallen since the early 1990s, but rising food prices are having an adverse effect on the poor and the number of people without access to food is rising.</p> <p>Although many people now employed, wages are too low to lever them out of poverty. Microfinance initiatives have, however, made a significant impact. Agricultural programmes to improve food production, particularly rice in sub-Saharan Africa, have also proved successful.</p> <p><strong>Goal Two: to achieve universal primary education</strong></p> <p><strong>Aim:</strong> To ensure that all children, boys and girls, complete primary school<br><strong>Progress:</strong> The number of children of primary school age out of education has fallen from 103 million in 1999 to 73 million in 2006, which means some 570 million children are enrolled in school. In southern Asia enrolment rates stand at more than 90%, while in sub-Saharan Africa the figure has reached 71%. Girls, however, are still disproportionately out of school, as are those children from poorer households and living in rural areas. Some 58 countries are on track to miss the 2015 target. Despite an increase in aid for education, from $1.6bn in 1999 to $5bn in 2006, it is estimated that $11bn is needed annually to achieve this goal.</p> <p><strong>Goal three: to promote gender equality and empower women</strong></p> <p><strong>Aim:</strong> To eliminate gender disparity in primary and secondary education<br><strong>Progress:</strong> Despite missing the 2005 interim target for this goal, two out of three countries have achieved gender parity at primary school, with girls primary enrolment increasing more than boys in developing countries between 2001 and 2006. However, the slow progress being made in some areas, including sub-Saharan African and western Asia, means, at the current rate, this target is still unlikely to be achieved. Lack of good private sanitation at schools remains a barrier to girls attending.</p> <p>Women now have more income-earning opportunities, occupying almost 40% of all paid jobs outside agriculture, compared to 35% in 1990. But the majority of women work in what are considered \"vulnerable jobs\", in which they are self-employed or unpaid family workers.</p> <p>Over the past eight years, more women have gained parliamentary seats, but high positions in government remain elusive for most.</p> <p>The UN states that violence against women is an obstacle to meeting this target. Some developing countries have introduced laws against rape and domestic violence, but the implementation of them is often patchy.</p> <p><strong>Goal four: To reduce child mortality</strong></p> <p><strong>Aim:</strong> To reduce mortality rates for children under five by two thirds<br><strong>Progress:</strong> Over the past 40 years, child mortality rates have dropped, but millions of children still die each year from preventable illnesses. At the current rate, reducing the mortality rate of children under five by two thirds won't be met in 62 countries. According to the UN in 27 countries the rates have remained static or have got worse. Lack of decent healthcare, malnutrition and poor sanitation are partly to blame. Despite targeted aid for maternal, newborn and child healthcare increasing from $2.1bn in 2003 to $3.5bn in 2006, more money is needed to achieve the goal.</p> <p><strong>Goal five: improve maternal health</strong></p> <p><strong>Aim:</strong> To reduce by three quarters the number of women who die during pregnancy or in childbirth. <br><strong>Progress:</strong> Three years ago, estimates showed that every minute a woman died of complications related to pregnancy and childbirth, almost all live in developing countries. Achieving this goal remains a huge task and experts believe that an extra $5-6bn needs to be channelled into this area to meet the target.</p> <p><strong>Goal six: combat HIV/Aids, malaria and other diseases</strong></p> <p><strong>Aim:</strong> To provide universal access to treatment for HIV and Aids, and to halt and reverse the spread, to halt and reverse the spread of malaria and other major diseases<br><strong>Progress:</strong> Some progress has been made to control the spread of malaria, through the distribution of bed nets and availability of drugs, but the disease still kills at least 1 million people a year, most in sub-Saharan African. More money will be needed to provide anti-malaria nets across the whole of Africa. Incidences of TB are expected to be halted and to decline before the 2015 deadline.</p> <p>However, achieving universal access to treatment for HIV and Aids by 2010 and halting and reversing the spread of the disease by 2015 are proving particularly difficult, with most countries not on track to meet the targets. Access to antiretroviral drugs has risen sharply, but only around a third of those needing treatment in developing countries are receiving it. Despite a tenfold increase in funding for HIV and Aids programmes to $10bn over the last 10 years, another $8bn is needed annually to combat the disease.</p> <p><strong>Goal seven: Ensure environmental sustainability</strong></p> <p><strong>Aim:</strong>To integrate principles of sustainable development into government policy, reduce biodiversity loss and to reduce by half the proportion of the population without access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation.<br><strong>Progress:</strong> Action is still needed to stop rising greenhouse gas emissions, and a redoubling of efforts are required to improve access to decent sanitation facilities, despite some steps in the right direction. Almost half of the world's population still face water scarcity and nearly 1 billion people have no access to safe drinking water.</p> <p><strong>Goal eight: Develop global partnership for development</strong></p> <p><strong>Aim:</strong>To address the needs of least developed countries, develop non-discriminatory trading and financial systems, deal with developing countries' debt, and make available new technology<br><strong>Progress:</strong> Despite governments giving $107.1bn in aid in 2005 - an all-time high \u2013 the figure dropped to $103.7bn last year. Aid needs to increase by $18bn a year to meet the promises made in Gleneagles to double aid by 2010. Only five developed countries have met or exceeded the target of giving 0.7% of gross national income (GNI) in aid. </p> <p>Achievements have been made to improve access to new technologies \u2013 computers, mobile phones \u2013 but progress has been hampered by lack of access to electricity, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Calls have been made for more public/private partnerships to address this problem.</p>",
  "<p>A \u00a3136m youth volunteering drive is today relaunching in a bid to get more young people in England involved in charity work.</p> <p>The organisation V was set up two years ago with the aim of getting a million young people to give up some of their free time - but it has been accused of failing to boost volunteering figures.</p> <p>V's own <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2008/sep/10/voluntarysector.volunteering\">research</a> revealed the majority of young people (66% of those questioned) find the term \"volunteering\" off-putting \u2013 and 21% suggested volunteering had a boring image.</p> <p>V's new campaign, Favours, aims to transform the way 16- to 25-year-olds in England perceive volunteering. Favours is so-called because in the V survey, 80% of young people said they had done a favour for someone outside their family and friends. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2007/nov/07/guardiansocietysupplement.volunteering\">Terry Ryall</a>, the V chief executive, explained: \"We think volunteering is as simple as doing someone a favour.\"</p> <p>The purpose of Favours, says Ryall, is to \"surprise, shock, excite and engage\" young people with schemes they normally \"wouldn't expect\" from a volunteering body.</p> <p>\"We want to show people volunteering is interesting, relevant, credible and has innovative opportunities in the areas they are passionate about\" says Ryall. V needed to \"start talking to the 16-25 age group in a way that resonates with them\".</p> <p>Despite the survey's findings, says Ryall, \"there is a growing appetite for volunteering\". The organisation, she adds, now wants to turn this interest into \"actual activity by making the offering so compelling young people can't resist it\". </p> <p>The campaign's first initiative, Fashion Favours, a collaboration with fashion designer Ben De Lisi and television presenter Miquita Oliver, was launched today.</p> <p>Fashion Favours is challenging volunteers to create a unique fashion collection using recycled and customised clothing under the guidance of De Lisi. The prime minister, Gordon Brown, and his wife, Sarah, were among the first to donate items from their wardrobes - giving garments they wore at this week's Labour party conference in Manchester.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337971541\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Society/Pix/pictures/2008/09/25/favourslaunch-220.jpg\" alt=\"Favours volunteering project for young people\" width=\"220\" height=\"352\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Favours projects will focusing on different areas in which young people can volunteer - including environment, fashion, or digital</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fashion Favours will be followed by Favours projects focusing on sport, music and technology.</p> <p>Among the challenges facing V is increasing publicity for volunteering bodies. A survey of young people last December found that 29% didn't know where to find information regarding volunteering opportunities for young people. </p> <p>Ryall says that organisations need to \"communicate the wide variety of interesting and diverse volunteering opportunities that are out there and show people what they can get involved with in their local area\".</p> <p>Although getting young people motivated is at the \"very core\" of the Favours campaign, the real mission is to \"make sure they stay engaged\" and continue to volunteer on a regular basis.</p> <p>Volunteering by its very nature is someone acting of their free will, says Ryall, but the aim of Favours and organisations such as V is to help young people to \"make the choice to do it\".</p> <p>\u2022 For more information about Favours, visit V's website, <a href=\"http://www.vinspired.com\">vinspired.com</a></p>",

  "<p>This week, over 150 world leaders are gathered at the UN for the opening of the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/ga/\">general assembly</a>. If recent years are any indication, news outlets will focus on the disagreements aired on Tuesday, when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/sep/23/george.bush.united.nations\">George Bush</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/sep/23/mahmoud.ahmadinejad.united.nations\">Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</a> took the podium. </p> <p>But the real drama occurs today (Thursday), when the same global leaders that butted heads earlier in the week take stock of one of the most far-reaching and noble statements of international cooperation ever agreed upon, the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/\">millennium development goals</a>. </p> <p>These eight <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/alloutonpoverty\">benchmarks</a>, agreed upon at the World Summit in 2000, are meant to be a statement of world support for the idea that all the world's citizens have the right to basic healthcare, education and nutrition, and the mechanisms necessary to support themselves, among other things. This week's meeting roughly marks the midpoint to the 2015 target date. </p> <p>So far, the glass <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/24/unitednations.internationalaidanddevelopment\">looks half empty</a>, but time has not yet run out. What is required now above all is a renewed commitment to global development on the part of the US, which, despite the recent economic downturn, remains the world's largest economy and dominant power.</p> <p>First, the good news. Thanks to improvements in prevention programmes and the availability of anti-retroviral treatments, we are starting to see a decline in the number of people who are becoming infected and dying from HIV/Aids for the first time since the UN started collecting data. Measles is also on the decline. Deaths from measles fell from 750,000 worldwide in 2000 to under 250,000 in 2007. Investments in malaria prevention are also showing results. The distribution of life-saving insecticide-treated bed nets is now widespread in 16 out of 20 malaria-endemic countries. Finally, thanks to campaigns to forgive the debts of so-called \"highly indebted poor countries\", the share of developing countries' export earnings devoted to paying external debts has fallen from 12.5% in 2000 to 6.6% in 2006.</p> <p>We have seen some progress. But data shows that it has been spread unevenly across the globe. The situation in sub-Saharan Africa remains particularly bleak. The global economic slowdown and rising cost of food has hit this region the hardest. The goal of reducing by half the number of people who live on a dollar a day will not be met there. To make matters worse, higher food prices threaten to push 100m more people into poverty and erode the measured progress we have made toward reducing childhood malnutrition. To compound all of these problems, international trade negotiations (the so-called Doha round) are years behind schedule and, even if they succeed, are in danger of being less development-focused than was once hoped.</p> <p>Still, there is enough time for us to reach most, if not all, of these goals. The US will play a pivotal role in whether or not those goals are achieved. The first thing we need to do is increase foreign aid. Americans are a generous people, and we expect the same of our government. But most Americans would be surprised to learn, however, that only 0.17% of our gross national income goes to government-sponsored development assistance programmes. That puts the US second to last (ahead of Greece) among developed countries' official development assistance expenditures. True, our philanthropic and private sectors are much more active than in any other country. But even the wealthiest philanthropy is no substitute for what the federal government can do.</p> <p>Just throwing money at the problem, however, is not the answer. We also need to reorganise our entire foreign aid apparatus, which has not undergone a significant overhaul since 1961. According to the <a href=\"http://modernizingforeignassistance.net/index.html\">Modernising Foreign Assistance Network</a>, US foreign assistance is spread across as many as 24 government agencies and 50 programmes. The Treasury department, state department, department of agriculture and sub-cabinet-level agencies like USAID and the Millennium Challenge Corporation compete with each other for precious foreign aid dollars. On top of that, individual members of Congress often add earmarks to fund foreign aid projects of their own parochial interests instead of what's best for those in need.</p> <p>We need a strategic and comprehensive view of how to spend taxpayer dollars more wisely and toward a common purpose. The Modernising Foreign Assistance Network advises that the next president fold these multiple arms of our aid apparatus into a single entity, which they recommend as a cabinet-level department of global development. Clearly, a foreign aid bureaucracy developed in 1961 needs to be updated to meet 21st-century challenges. </p> <p>There are hopeful signs that both our presidential candidates get this. Barack Obama has proposed doubling America's foreign development assistance to $50bn. And, like Obama, John McCain considers eliminating extreme poverty and fighting HIV/Aids imperative to American national security interests. </p> <p>These are decent first steps, but not enough. Fighting global poverty today is a wise down payment on a more stable and prosperous future. The millennium development goals tells us what needs to be done to live in a world free of extreme, endemic poverty. The next president can show us how to get there.</p>",
  "<p>The most interesting section of <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/reutersEdge/idUKLNE48N01H20080924\">Gordon Brown's speech</a> on Tuesday was his drawing of dividing lines between Labour and the Conservatives on the economy, presenting Labour as the party to step in to protect people and the Tories as a party that would leave it to the market to decide: \" ... no rescue of Northern Rock, no action on speculation, no protection for mortgages, doing nothing to stop banks going under\". Labour's prospects in the next election depend decisively on whether this argument can be developed into clear and widely understood differences between the two main parties.</p> <p>No solution is offered by the \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/17/labour.labourleadership\">rebels</a>\" who want to precipitate the removal of Gordon Brown. Even though they wish to plunge the Labour party into a drawn-out leadership process most are not prepared to say in public who they want to replace the prime minister. I completely distrust, as will the public, a campaign with an immediate tactical objective but not motivated by any stated policy content \u2013 either in terms of the British economy or over foreign policy, or on global warming or anything else for that matter. It is policy that has to be addressed.</p> <p>A financial hurricane is destroying the economic majority consensus that has dominated British politics since Margaret Thatcher came to power. When New Labour won the 1997 general election it did not propose to dismantle the basic economic framework of the Reagan and Thatcher era, but to weld onto it more steps on social justice, the environment and other measures. This was the \"third way\".</p> <p>Now everyone admits that we are witnessing the greatest financial crisis since 1929. The financial structure of the Reagan-led era is disintegrating around us.</p> <p>In the US a deeply right-wing Republican president has carried out, with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and AIG, the largest nationalisations in the history of the world outside a revolution \u2013 taking over institutions whose assets are more than twice the size of Britain's GDP. Far from markets being left to run themselves, the US government is intervening on a daily, and in some cases an hourly, basis.</p> <p>Labour's policy was initially hamstrung from responding to this adequately by the acceptance of the legacy of Thatcherism. Compare the rapid nationalisation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the largest non-governmental financial institutions in the world, with the protracted period before Northern Rock was taken over \u2013 something which undoubtedly damaged the government's reputation on the economy. Nonetheless, in his speech to conference yesterday, Gordon Brown was right to say that the difference with Cameron is now crystal clear \u2013 the Tory policy was to let Northern Rock fold in the name of Thatcherite dogma.</p> <p>Similarly, there will be decisive choices on taxation and spending. We are facing a huge public spending crunch. Over the next three years borrowing will be <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/542f8680-82a0-11dd-a019-000077b07658.html\">\u00a365bn higher</a> than the Treasury's last projections \u2013 largely due to the economic slowdown precipitated by the current financial meltdown. The decisive question, the consequences of which will touch every person in the country, is who will pay for the collapse of the Reaganite-Thatcherite financial system? So far, the public have feared that the government may make them pay that price and they are nervous and apprehensive as a result. That is why our poll ratings are so dreadful. Brown is now seeking to project, both with his conference speech and with his welcome comments last week about cleaning up the financial markets, the view that only Labour can protect people in these circumstances. He is totally right and people can understand this clear position. The Tories will make ordinary people pay twice over \u2013 first for the construction of the financial system of Thatcherism and Reaganism and then for its collapse.</p> <p>The adequate means to ensure Labour protects people are at hand. At present a windfall tax on energy companies, progressive taxation on higher earners, scrapping the absurdly costly plan for a new generation of nuclear weapons to replace Trident, and putting an end to military adventures such as Iraq would generate quite sufficient resources to mean there was no need for economic attacks on ordinary voters. They would finance real aid for people in facing high energy bills and help those worried about losses from falling house prices.</p> <p>But it is quite possible this financial crisis will deepen further \u2013 that Northern Rock and HBOS will be the start of it, not its culmination. It is therefore vital that, unlike with Northern Rock, Labour is prepared to take decisive immediate action and not be shackled by disintegrating Tory dogmas.</p> <p>George Bush and Hank Paulson have been prepared for the state to act decisively and quickly in a way Labour was not, and we should take a leaf out of their book \u2013 not in what they do, but in their understanding that faced with events of this magnitude only the state has the scale of resources required to take decisive action.</p> <p>Strategically there are a number of key conclusions. This financial crisis is shifting the centre of growth of the world economy even more clearly to Brazil, Russia, India and China \u2013 the Bric economies. It is here that the UK must be building its key new links and it should be de-emphasising the relatively stagnant, and now crisis-ridden, US economy.</p> <p>Even Bush has been forced to give voice to the anger in the US at the way so many American companies avoid paying tax through offshore tax havens. So this is a time for Britain and America to create new financial rules to squeeze these tax havens out of existence.</p> <p>The economic system constructed under Thatcher and Reagan is collapsing around us. The Tory party was partly responsible for this failed system and this gives Labour the opportunity to take the offensive \u2013 provided it is bold and draws the necessary conclusions.</p> <p>Gordon Brown now has an opportunity to set Labour's agenda for the coming decade.</p> <p>Labour has to take the arguments of his speech that addressed these issues and follow through with policies that will protect the public. As someone is going to have to pay the price for this economic crisis, Labour has to make clear it will not be the people the party must represent but the Tories whose Thatcherite system created this mess in the first place.</p>",
  "<p>Speculation is rife about the ins and outs of a possible reshuffle expected at end of next week. Who should stay, who should go? </p> <p>We now know that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/25/gordonbrown.ruthkelly\">Ruth Kelly won't be in the next cabinet</a>. Geoff Hoon, the chief whip, is tipped to replace Peter Mandelson as European commissioner next year, but that would mean another dreaded byelection for Labour in the <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/hoc/constituency/0,,-678,00.html\">Ashfield</a> constituency in Nottinghamshire, where Hoon holds a majority of 10,213. If he goes to Europe, it won't be for a while. </p> <p>In the meantime, Hoon could be moved to take Kelly's transport secretary brief, which would make way for Brown's ally and deputy chief whip Nick Brown to be promoted to chief whip. Many MPs fear Brown (Nick) and this is a good thing for whips charged with maintaining order in the parliamentary Labour ranks. <br> Could Ed Balls leave the Department for Children, Families and Schools to replace Alistair Darling as chancellor? Darling's assured speech at the party conference might save him, and anyway, is it wise to change your Treasury team in the middle of an global economic crisis? </p> <p>Could Jacqui Smith leave the Home Office for education? Immigration minister Liam Byrne is seen as a cabinet contender, though a conviction last year for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/nov/02/ukcrime.immigrationpolicy\">driving while using his mobile phone</a> is a smudge on an otherwise impeccable political CV which would probably rule him out for promotion in the Home Office. </p> <p>Another minister from the same department, Tony McNulty, is also seen as a potential winner in a shakeup. So too is Cabinet Office minister Ed Miliband, seen as a Brown loyalist, who might wrest environment from Hilary Benn. </p> <p>There is talk that Europe minister Jim Murphy is gearing up to head a new department of the nations, to replace the Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland offices. </p> <p>Which leaves us wondering if Brown's critics and his enemies will be targeted for demotion. Would the PM entertain moving David Miliband from the Foreign Office, or would that only serve to underline the threat posed by the young pretender to Brown's job? It would depend on whether he was moved to another heavyweight role - say the Home Office - or was demoted. Will other Blairites be weeded out \u2013 Hazel Blears, John Hutton, James Purnell? </p> <p>Also doing the rounds is the prospect of Harriet Harman losing some of her myriad responsibilities. At the moment Harman is juggling several roles in the Commons: leader of the House of Commons, secretary of state for equalities, minister for Women, deputy Labour leader and lord privy seal. </p> <p>And what about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/25/labourconference.taxandspending\">Jon Cruddas</a>, the darling of the left who had a good show in Manchester?</p> <p>How should Brown compose his next cabinet? Should he tweak, should he go large, or should he leave it well alone? What fantasy Team GB would you put in place to maximise Labour's chances of leading, rather than trailing, in the polls?

  "<p>The growth in online advertising will dramatically slow this year due to the crisis in the global financial markets and the downturn in the UK economy, according to a report.</p> <p>Advertisers will shun the display ads which underpin many websites, according to the report, Navigating Choppy Waters, by PricewaterhouseCoopers. </p> <p>There will still be stronger growth in online advertising than spending on other media, such as television and newspapers, but growth is expected to slow from 38% in 2007 to 20%.</p> <p>PWC said the slowdown was not caused by advertisers cutting online from their marketing spend, but by advertisers reducing their overall budgets.</p> <p>Online advertising in Europe is the third largest segment of the market after newspapers/magazines and TV in several countries including the UK. Last year PWC estimated the European online advertising market was worth \u20ac11bn (\u00a38.7bn).</p> <p>The UK is Europe's largest online advertising market. Spending on internet adverts was \u20ac3.825bn last year, according to PWC's figures, up 38% and accounting for 20% of the entire UK ad market.</p> <p>The report comes after research from Enders earlier in the week that also warned of an advertising slowdown. Enders forecasts the market will grow 18.5% this year, compared with its earlier forecast of 28% growth, to \u00a33.3bn. Its figures are roughly in line with those in the PWC report.</p> <p>Both reports see the slowdown hit display advertising the hardest, with advertisers reducing the number of banner adverts and pop-ups they place on websites in order to focus on areas that generate more tangible results, such as online search. PWC said display advertising would grow at 10% to 15%.</p> <p>\"As the economy shrinks and consumption decreases, the perceived need by companies to invest in brand advertising, or to keep pace with spend by competitors is less acute,\" the PWC report says of the flight from display advertising.</p> <p>Those who are still spending, meanwhile, demand a better return on their investment so they put their cash into online search, where results can be more easily measured.</p> <p>\"While in the UK, share of display in total online advertising spend decreased from 28% in 2004 to 21% in 2007, this may shift even further if the downturn is prolonged,\" PWC warns.</p> <p>Prices are also likely to decline as a multitude of websites chase too few advertisers. </p> <p>However, spending on search advertising is likely to outperform the overall online market this year, growing at slightly less than 30% in the UK. </p> <p>\"In a time of economic uncertainty, advertisers often take a more cautious approach,\" according to the PWC report. \"Consequently, there is an increasing focus on measurable return on investment of online campaigns, shifting some budgets from brand-building related towards direct response spend.

  "<p>Until mid-afternoon yesterday, the biggest story of the day was the allegation, made by the New York Times, that a firm owned by John McCain's campaign manage had received <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/24/uselections2008.johnmccain1\">tens of thousands of dollars in regular payments</a> from the mortgage lender Freddie Mac - which is deeply implicated in the current economic crisis - until as recently as last month. The other big news was Obama's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/sep/24/uselections2008.barackobama\">nine-point lead</a> in a Washington Post opinion poll. Then came a shock announcement from the McCain campaign that wiped both stories, along with most others, from the news agenda. It seems possible that this wasn't entirely a coincidence. </p> <p>McCain <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/24/uselections2008.johnmccain3\">declared that he was suspending his campaigning</a> and returning from New York to Washington in order to help broker a bipartisan agreement on the bailout proposal, which is still being angrily debated in Congress. He urged Obama to do the same - and requested a postponement of the first debate of the general election season, due to take place tomorrow in Oxford, Mississippi. </p> <p>Now was not the time for partisan politics, he said. But the political advantages of the move were obvious: if Obama consented to a postponement, McCain would emerge as the bipartisan leader, taking charge in a crisis. And if Obama didn't go along with the plan, McCain could still say he'd tried to take the higher road. </p> <p>Obama didn't go along with the plan: to do so would have been tactically brainless. Instead, at a press conference in Florida, he argued that it was more important now than ever for voters to hear what the presidential candidates had to say - and he didn't show much patience for McCain's suggestion that the crisis meant the debate couldn't proceed. \"It is going to be part of the president's job to deal with more than one thing at once,\" he noted. Obama's campaign said they'd been caught unawares by the McCain announcement. Earlier in the afternoon, the two men had apparently agreed by telephone to issue a joint statement on the Wall Street situation. (Each campaign sought to present the joint statement as its own idea.) </p> <p>Later yesterday evening, in a televised address to the nation, President Bush warned that \"our entire economy is in danger\" if a rescue plan could not be agreed. Both presidential candidates are expected to meet him at the White House today. </p> <h2>What to watch out for</h2> <p>Honestly, who knows? Predicting the shape of this election season is rapidly turning into a fool's game. Assuming Obama holds fast on tomorrow's debate, all eyes will be on McCain today as he choreographs the shift from trying to call off the debate to showing up in Mississippi anyway. Assuming he does. What on earth happens if only Obama is there? </p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>There were no significant changes in the daily tracking polls; Gallup had no change at all, putting <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/110647/Gallup-Daily-Obama-Maintains-3Point-Edge.aspx\">Obama at 47% and McCain at 44%</a>. An <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-poll25-2008sep25,0,4911734.story\">LA Times/Bloomberg poll</a> put the candidates at 49%-45% among likely voters.

  "<p>Gordon Brown is promoting his plan for an international regulator to oversee the international financial markets and prevent further economic turbulence during talks with world leaders in New York. </p> <p>The prime minister convened a meeting of leaders - including Spanish prime minister Jose Zapatero, European commission president Jose Barrroso, Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd, Brazilian president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and Danish prime minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen - to discuss the global credit crisis at in the Waldorf hotel last night. </p> <p>On his way to New York, Brown revealed he was examining the way British pension funds facilitate short selling by lending their stock to hedge funds. </p> <p>Brown praised the bail out of Wall Street, saying it was necessary to stop the financial institutions freezing up by removing illiquid or so-called toxic assets. </p> <p>The prime minister is fighting for a multi-part package with world leaders, but has no meeting scheduled with senior US Treasury figures as they battle in Washington with Congress to win legislative approval for the $700bn package. </p> <p>He has called for international regulation, greater transparency and responsibility in executive bonuses to encourage longer-term decision making. Brown believes the IMF, working with the Financial Stability Forum - a group of central banks, regulators and international bodies - \"should be at the heart of an early warning system for financial turbulence affecting the global economy\". The forum is due to report on a proposal in autumn. </p> <p>He has also been privately testing the water to see whether there are grounds for restarting world trade talks in the near future. </p> <p>Many world leaders are in New York for the special UN general assembly devoted to trying to meet the millennium development goals, as well as former US president Bill Clinton's annual Global Initiative meeting. </p> <p>Initial polls suggest Brown's standing in the polls has been boosted by his promise in his conference speech to be the rock of stability in the credit crisis. Brown is determined to spend the two days in New York fighting both for more money for the world's poor and a weighty package to sort out the credit crisis. </p> <p>Brown will be aware that the economy can swing votes massively, and will have witnessed the Democratic presidential candidate, Barack Obama, enjoying a poll surge as the Republicans suffer from the incumbency factor. </p> <p>Brown insists he has done everything he needed to increase liquidity in UK markets, and privately complains the crisis could have been minimised had his proposals on international regulation been implemented earlier. </p> <p>He says his form of risk-based regulation has worked, but the scale of the new financial instruments outwitted the regulators. </p> <p>Brown is concerned that the costs of the credit crisis, as well as the economic down turn, will mean the developed world turns off the tap on funding to alleviate poverty. He has been working on ambitious packages on education, health and eradicating deaths from malaria by 2015. </p> <p>His aides, as well as some of the celebrities accompanying him, such as supermodel Elle Macpherson, have spoken of fears of donor fatigue as people struggle to pay the rent. Macpherson is determined to stress that aid does help fight poverty. </p> <p>The supermodel was accompanying Sarah Brown, the prime minister's wife, along with Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, a dedicated charity worker, to a leader's wives dinner convened to raise awareness for Brown's White Ribbon Alliance and Safe Motherhood charity. The dinner in Manhatten was co-hosted by Queen Rania of Jordan and Wendi Murdoch, the wide of the media mogul.</p>",
  "<p>The Church of England's two most senior clerics have launched a scathing attack on the financial industry, calling the bankers and speculators behind the credit crisis \"bank robbers\" and \"asset strippers\".</p> <p>Dr Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury, demanded tighter regulation of the industry and said it was out of touch with reality. </p> <p>Williams added that Karl Marx had been right in his assessment of the nature of capitalism.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu, said the market took its rules of trade \"from Alice in Wonderland\".</p> <p>In an article published in the Spectator magazine, Williams wrote: \"It is no use pretending that the financial world can maintain indefinitely the degree of exemption from scrutiny and regulation that it has got used to.</p> <p>\"This crisis exposes the basic level of unreality in the situation \u2014 the truth that almost unimaginable wealth has been generated by equally unimaginable levels of fiction, paper transactions with no concrete outcome beyond profit for traders.</p> <p>\"Marx long ago observed the way in which unbridled capitalism became a kind of mythology, ascribing reality, power and agency to things that had no life in themselves; he was right about that, if about little else.\" </p> <p>In a speech to last night's annual dinner of the Worshipful Company of International Bankers, Sentamu criticised the practice of short-selling, temporarily banned by the Financial Services Authority following the takeover of HBOS by Lloyds TSB.</p> <p>\"To a bystander like me, those who made \u00a3190m deliberately underselling the shares of HBOS in spite of a very strong capital base, and drove it into the arms of Lloyds TSB, are clearly bank robbers and asset strippers,\" he said.</p> <p>\"We find ourselves in a market system which seems to have taken its rules of trade from Alice in Wonderland. </p> <p>\"Our country has built its financial strength historically on the manufacturing of goods, where money was the medium of exchange.</p> <p>\"In the last week, we have seen its systems come close to ruin because now money is no longer being the medium of exchange for goods, but rather is the very item that is being traded.\"</p> <p>Sentamu also spoke about today's talks at the UN in New York about the 15-year millennium development goals project to reduce global poverty. </p> <p>The initiative's target of halving the number of people who live on less than a dollar a day by 2015 was unlikely to be met in sub-Saharan Africa, he said.</p> <p>\"Without a solid global economic base to work from, the eradication of world poverty would be an even greater task,\" he added. </p> <p>\"One of the ironies about this financial crisis is that it makes action on poverty look utterly achievable. It would cost $5bn (\u00a32.7bn) to save six million children's lives.</p> <p>\"World leaders could find 140 times that amount for the banking system in a week. How can they tell us that action for the poorest is too expensive?\"</p>",
  "<p>Seeing as how everyone from Roky Erickson to Luther Vandross has been the subject of a tribute album, it comes as little surprise to find that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/aug/01/popandrock.suicide\">Suicide</a> are next in line for a similar kind of treatment. To mark the occasion of Alan Vega's 70th birthday, Blast First are about to release a series of EPs featuring a diverse range of artists (Springsteen, Primal Scream, Klaxons, Vincent Gallo, Julian Cope \u2026 ) covering <a href=\"http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/51468-bruce-liars-spiritualized-grinderman-cover-suicide\">the work of Vega and Rev</a>. The only surprising thing about this is that it's taken so long to transpire. Tribute albums tend to work most effectively when the subjects reside at the cult end of the musical spectrum - Naked in the Afternoon: a Tribute to Jandek, More Oar: a Tribute to Alexander \"Skip\" Spence and <a href=\"http://www.hihowareyou.com/\">The Late Great Daniel Johnston</a> immediately spring to mind. Given that Suicide are the most cultish of cult bands, you'd think we'd be knee-deep in Vega/Rev tribute records by now.</p> <p>If we accept that the Velvet Underground have long since been accepted into the mainstream rock canon, there's also a case to be made for Suicide as the most influential of all remaining cult bands. From post-punk to the rash of synth-and-voice duos that proliferated in the 80s, from industrial rock to techno, Suicide's fingerprints are all over it all. In the 38 years of their existence, Vega and Rev have not caused pop chart compilers too many sleepless nights. But name-checking them among your favourites has always been one of the most effective short cuts to super-hip credibility. Unless, that is, you happen to be a man trying to impress a lady. In which case, at least in my experience, Suicide's music is a guaranteed kiss of death.</p> <p>Suicide have loomed monstrously large in the long-running debacle that has been my romantic life, starting in 1978 when I took my first girlfriend Lynda to see <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiVvA9YQpiI\">the Clash</a>, with Suicide in support. The phlegm rained down with vehement bite that night, all of it intended for Vega, a good gallon of it landing on the head of my date. She broke up with me during the train ride home, accusing me of having the worst musical taste of any man that ever walked the earth. That's simply not true. I know of a man in Bournemouth who has much worse taste than me.</p> <p>Still, I didn't learn my lesson where Suicide were concerned. I went on to court a girl called Frankie. Early on in our relationship I thought it would be a beezer idea to compile her a C90 tape exclusively made up of songs with the name \"Frank\" or \"Frankie\" in the title. With acres of tape left after I was done with the obvious numbers, I opted to include Suicide's Frankie Teardrop which tells the heart-warming story of a Vietnam vet who kills his entire family before turning the gun on himself. After handing the tape over, I never heard from her again. Who knows? Maybe it was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juAmEb_r1NA\">Eno's Blank Frank </a>she objected to.</p> <p>Surely, though, it was no coincidence that Valerie decided to dump me halfway through an Alan Vega solo show in New York in 1985. I'm also prepared to accept that Melinda started to go off me when I chose Suicide's Dream Baby Dream to soundtrack our bedroom gymnastics. And I'm starting to realise that it was never the same between me and my most recent partner after I treated her to a fun-packed night out involving a double-bill of Suicide and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuDP7c3Zd8I\">Grinderman </a>at The Forum.</p> <p>Has anyone else's love life been similarly cursed by a single band? Or is there any couple out there whose love and passion are sustained by the undeniable beauty that resides at the heart of Suicide's atonal terror? If so, I'd very much like to hear from you.</p>",

  "<p>Last week a leaked government document revealed that <a href=\"http://www.euractiv.com/en/climate-change/uk-wants-offsets-eu-climate-regime/article-175507\">Labour ministers are lobbying the EU</a> to allow Britain to meet up to half of its 2020 emissions <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/environment/climat/emission/linking_en.htm\">reductions targets</a> by buying credits from the developing world.</p> <p>It is true that a tonne of carbon dioxide pollution saved in Bangalore is the same as a tonne saved in Birmingham \u2013 but by <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/08/35&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en\"> paying others to make carbon reductions for us</a>, Labour are selling Britain short by subsidising abroad the efficiencies and savings we need to make at home.</p> <p>There are many thousands of new and well-paid jobs that could be created in the UK with a major national push on energy efficiency, microgeneration and renewable energy technologies. If we are only to pick the lowest hanging fruit of cheap emissions reductions in Britain and then just turn to the carbon markets to pay developing countries to fill the gap on the cheap, then we will be passing on the opportunity to lead the world in the conversion to a low-carbon economy.</p> <p>If we opt to only make the minimum of reductions here at home we will still lumber on with business as usual, using old and energy inefficient practice. This will lock in a new generation of polluting infrastructure that will become increasingly expensive for us to offset in the future, as the cost of polluting increases with a rising carbon price.</p> <p>This is not the way it has to be \u2013 and not the way the <a href=\"http://www.conservatives.com/tile.do?def=news.story.page&amp;obj_id=129351\">Conservative party views the climate challenge</a>. Other countries are embracing change: Germany already has over 250,000 jobs in renewable technologies. Yet Britain has, at best, 15,000. We don't even know exactly how many green tech jobs we have in the UK because the government doesn't bother to count them.</p> <p>Both Barack Obama and John McCain have declared that they see 5 million <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/26/business/businessspecial2/26collar.html\">\"green collar\"</a> jobs being created in the new US energy economy. Indeed it is expected that global green industries will be worth \u00a3350bn a year by 2010 \u2013 as big as the global aerospace industry is today. That is the opportunity before us today \u2013 and we can be sure that if Britain doesn't move to seize this new market, others will. </p> <p>No one pretends that squeezing more efficiency out of our economy will be easy, but at a time of economic stress for Britain Gordon Brown should be looking for ways to create more jobs in the UK, not lobbying to use tax payers' money to create green tech jobs overseas. While the reduction of carbon being dumped into the atmosphere will be the same regardless of where it happens \u2013 and it must happen \u2013 our political leaders must ensure that as much of the economic opportunity as possible remains here in Britain.</p>",
  "<p>It's assessment time, the halfway stage, for the <strong><a href=\"http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/\">Millennium Development Goals </a></strong>. Agreed at the United Nations in 2000, the target date for achieving the vast ambition of ending global poverty is 2015. Although there have been spectacular successes, particularly in south east Asia, there has been only slow and patchy progress elsewhere, while in sub-Saharan Africa, and in some former Soviet republics, the number of people in poverty has actually risen.</p> <p>Today, 100 heads of government are meeting in New York to work out what needs to be done to boost the chances of reaching the <strong><a href=\"http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mdg/Resources/Static/Products/Progress2008/MDG_Report_2008_En.pdf#page=46\">eight goals</a></strong> that have been built around livelihoods, health and education.</p> <p>Mid-global financial crisis, it's likely to be a lot harder than in 2005 to persuade donor countries to up the amount of aid they make available. It's already fallen from the all-time record of $107bn reached that year, to $104bn. Overseas aid always gets hard to sell when the going gets tough at home.</p> <p>But that's not the only reason why support may weaken, despite the commitment of the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon. The idea of setting fixed and prescriptive goals - with subsidiary targets that are supposed to offer waymarks to the final destination - has been controversial from the start, and evidence from the field in some cases backs up the scepticism.</p> <p>The goals were established as global targets. But they are delivered, and measured (not always reliably), within individual countries. Some observers question whether the goals are <strong><a href=\"http://www.odi.org.uk/publications/briefing-papers/19-aid-allocation-mdgs.pdf \">distorting aid allocation</a></strong>, so that money goes to one country, or one project, that might be used more effectively - judged by poverty alleviation - in another.</p> <p>In particular the individual targets are feared to be damagingly prescriptive. That could mean that money is diverted from the chronically to the merely slightly poor. And while early progress might be highly efficient in terms of aid use, striving, for example, to engage the last few per cent of children in full-time education could be disproportionately costly. Hence the new mantra: targets should be taken \"seriously, but not literally\". </p> <p>Economists might invent some different way of measuring progress towards the targets that would allow more flexibility. But the greatest asset of the MDGs is their simplicity and their clarity. They have been invaluable as a way of focusing global attention and vision in high level politics - as this week's high level summit shows again - and mobilising public support and resources.</p> <p>But that is more true for the rich north than the poor south. In some developing countries there is resentment at what's seen as the external imposition of targets that may not reflect local needs or desires. Insecurity - from civil war to theft and rape - is a fundamental cause of poverty, but it is not addressed at all by the MDGs.</p> <p>Care International, in its <strong><a href=\"http://www.careinternational.org.uk/11640/media-releases/global-aid-reform-summit-must-tackle-conflict-or-millions-will-lose-out-on-the-millennium-development-goals-.html\">recent report</a></strong> pointed out how vulnerable countries in conflict are. One in three child deaths and 29% of 12-year-olds who fail to complete primary school in developing countries live in so-called \"fragile\" states. Nearly one third of the world's poorest people live in countries in conflict, and progress on the goals to reduce extreme poverty and cut maternal mortality has gone backwards.</p> <p>The <strong><a href=\"http://www.odi.org.uk/publications/annual-report/2008-article-mdgs.pdf\"> Overseas Development Institute</a></strong> wants to develop the idea of the social protection, where humanitarian aid and development are woven together more closely. The real anxiety - when no country has yet reached the north's only MDG target of spending 0.7% of GDP on aid - is that in a climate of economic crisis, funding will fall more sharply.</p> <p>Without renewed and redirected aid and energy, the MDGs will fail. Failure not only condemns millions to preventable illness and early death, it will also make it harder to engage and motivate the developed world in renewing its efforts.</p>",
  "<p>I never thought I would find myself in agreement with George Bush. On Friday I did.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/19/wallstreet.georgebush\"><br>Speaking at the White House</a> on the large scale federal intervention in the financial markets he stated that \"government intervention is not only warranted, it is essential\u2026America's economy is facing unprecedented challenges. We're responding with unprecedented measures.\" </p> <p>What the US and British government interventions highlight are the limits of markets to operate in a stable fashion in times of acute financial crisis. Instead, what we have seen is mass panic, collapses and a downwards spin into a financial black hole which could have ended with widespread financial collapse.</p> <p>The market is a wonderful device when it works properly. But markets are prone to failures, to the mispricing of risk and to manipulation and abuse. There is also no guarantee that free markets will operate in the public interest as <a href=\"http://www.adamsmith.org/smith/won-index.htm\">Adam Smith realised 200 years ago</a>.</p> <p>Believers in the self-regulating power of the market and free enterprise delude themselves if they think that the free market can fix all problems. It can't, and from time to time it gets into major trouble as a result of market excesses such that the whole edifice is in danger of collapsing. We were at such a moment in the world financial markets last week.</p> <p>The magnitude of the collapse caused by ill-judged mortgage lending and over-complex derivatives, and intensified by speculators and short sellers, has come close to bringing the financial system to its knees. It is on such an occasion that it is necessary for central governments to step in and do what is necessary to keep the system in being. </p> <p>Left to its own devices, parts of the global capitalist system would have crashed in flames several times in the last 40 years without government intervention to pick up the pieces. It's no use saying let the discipline of the market work it out. The consequences would be too painful. The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_and_Loan_crisis\">savings and loan crisis</a> 25 years ago is a case in point. </p> <p>The US Treasury and the Federal Reserve have done very well to date in intervening to keep the whole system from breaking off its bearings and crashing to the ground. The organised takeover of Bear Sterns, the decision to effectively take over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the bail out of American Insurance Group were clearly not enough. Hence the measures announced on Thursday to hive off the toxic waste into a special vehicle and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/18/regulators.stockmarkets\">prohibit short selling</a> of financial stocks in the US and the UK.</p> <p>Free marketers seem to believe that the US and UK government are behaving irrationally or unfairly in imposing tight controls in a time of crisis. They seem to think that speculators should be allowed free rein to push down share prices as they see fit and that we should live with the consequences of market failure. This is unrealistic.</p> <p>Senator Jim Bunning of Kentucky, an ultra conservative, has stated that: \"The free market for all intents and purposes is dead in America\", adding that the Treasury proposal would \"take away the free market and institute socialism in America\". How wrong he is. </p> <p>The government measures are not acting against the interests of capitalism and the free market. On the contrary, they are acting to preserve its long term stability and existence. The relationship between the state and capital in capitalist societies is a close one, where the role of the state is to ensure the preservation of the capitalist system. This is what we are seeing right now. </p> <p>The financial free marketeers chasing maximum profits have shot themselves in the foot by permitting the excesses of the last few years. Arguably governments should have done much more to control the risks much earlier. They did not, and we are now paying the price of what Alan Greenspan termed \"irrational exuberance\" but did little to control.</p> <p>The Federal Reserve Bank, the Bank of England and the FSA eventually came to the rescue and the system is likely to live another day. </p> <p>There will undoubtedly be major financial aftershocks as the scale of the debt becomes clearer. There will be more bank failures and takeovers, and not a few hedge funds are likely to go down in flames in coming weeks, but that is the price to be paid when the market fails and government has to step in to clear up the mess. It should exact a high price from the banks for the bail out.</p>",
  "<p>Phil Taylor is an unusually fidgety, chatty, twitchy kind of ice-cool sporting legend. The Power is 48 years old now: winner of 75 major tournaments, 13-time world champion, the first darts player to hoover up more than \u00a31m in prize money, and a man in a rich vein of form ahead of Sunday's South African Masters. You'd think by now Stoke's darting colossus might be ready to bask, leonine, in the glow of his accumulated glories. Or at least just to settle back and talk about darts a lot.</p> <p>Except, he doesn't really seem to fancy it. Other topics keep grabbing his attention. During the course of a two-hour chat at his house on the green fringes of Stoke, the Power disappears briefly to chop up a turnip, telephones John Terry, fixes a problem with his oven, talks with great enthusiasm about staying with Robbie Williams in Los Angeles and offers some weighty professional admiration for the accuracy of Rory Delap's long throw. All right Phil. Now, back to the darts ... Phil?</p> <p>This is a bit of a surprise. From a distance the most interesting thing about Taylor is his utter single-mindedness, the unwavering stare of the ultimate warrior of the oche. This has been the story of his career too. Until last year, his 21st in competitive darts, Taylor had never experienced a dip in form. His record is a match for anyone in any sport. Whatever it is that he's got, it cuts through the backyard rough and tumble of darts and speaks to the sporting gods, the cross-disciplinary aristocracy of the dead-eyed career winner. So what is it, then, the Power's special power? And how do you get some?</p> <p>\"Some of the lads say to me, \"What's the secret?\"\" he shrugs. \"I say 'get four kids'. It focuses your mind. It's not easy. You've got to provide for them, put shoes on their feet, food on their plates. I suppose it's just in you. It's that moment when you either win or lose. You've either got it or you haven't got it. It's not about practice. You can practise as much as you want, but you can't practise shitting yourself.\"</p> <p>That moment - the match-closing pick-off, the shit-yourself last leg 180 - is what big league darts is all about. It's sport reduced to its most simple formula. There's nowhere to hide in darts, no bad luck, no ref to blame: there you are, pinned and wriggling on the wall. And these big moments are what Taylor handles so much better than anybody else. If he has a secret, it seems to be an unusual relish for raw man-to-man combat.</p> <p>\"With darts it's just one against one, it's blow for blow. The only thing I could compare it to is boxing. It's dead exciting. You're reacting to each other, the adrenaline's pumping. You don't feel calm at all. But it's all about being able to win when you're pumped up. People say you don't play the player; I play the player every time.</p> <p>\"It's about reading the body language. I can see it in other sports. I can see when people's minds are wrong. You can see when a footballer's going to miss a penalty. In darts you wait for that dip and then you hit them hard.\" And of course, this kind of dip never happens to the Power. \"No. I just keep on coming.\"</p> <p>There was a period when Taylor wasn't quite so sure. Eighteen months ago he seemed to be in the process of being overhauled by a generation of eager young darters, buff and unsmiling athletes of the oche, young men who see a good living in the game and treat it like any other high stakes pay-TV sport (\"cocky,\" he calls them with a smile).</p> <p>At one point Taylor even engaged a sports psychologist and became an enthusiastic convert, listening to tapes of crowd noise, sitting through his pre-match Oasis psyche-up CD, doing his visualisations. \"Didn't do me any good at all,\" he says now. \"I wouldn't bother with it. They tell you things you already know. You can't teach people to win, it's in you, you've either got it or you haven't.\"</p> <p>Whatever it is, Taylor got it back - and triumphantly. So far this year he's won the Las Vegas Classic, a second US Open and twelve PDC Pro Tour events. In August he won the World Matchplay, beating young pretender James Wade 18-9, and ending the match with a final bull from the side of the oche to slip past another dart, a shot commentator Sid Waddell described as the best he had ever seen. \"I forget these things,\" he says of that feted bull. \"I'd forgotten until you reminded me. All I can remember is doing the karaoke with Joe Longthorne after.\"</p> <p>He will admit to being a little suspired by his own new-found boldness. \"When I started out as a pro, me, Jocky, Eric, Lowey, we never used to get those kind of shots. You just didn't go for them. But they're doing them all the time now. The youngsters, they're like the snooker players, they go for clear-the-table every time. I thought I'll have a go.\"</p> <p>Can he feel he's nailed a shot like that even before it goes in? \"No.\" Does he ever dream about darts? \"Sometimes, yes, I do. I might be nodding off in my chair and my arm will go like that [flicks it out like a man throwing a snatched dart]. I'll wake up and go 'stop doing that'. Then I'll go back to sleep and do it again. I get annoyed because I wake myself up twitching and throwing darts. It happens every night near enough. I'll be dreaming I'm going for the shot and my arms will go like that and I'll throw it.\"</p> <p>Taylor has a mildly compulsive side. He doesn't let himself play golf regularly (\"I'd get obsessed with it\"). Even taking up swimming as an aid to weight loss ahead of the winter season has led to him musing on \"getting the strokes right, getting books and learning it right\". Darts is that kind of a sport. You'd think it might appeal to the number-cruncher, the maths crank, the OCD-merchant. But Taylor isn't really any of these. If there's a secret to his special power it doesn't lie this way.</p> <p>For one thing he's too easily distracted by other stuff. In no particular order, during our brief chat Taylor gets lulled into talking about having dinner with Ronnie O'Sullivan, meeting Michael Ballack at an airport, playing darts with assorted Premier League footballers (James Milner is \"a very good player\") and twice compares himself to Stuart Pearce and Roy Keane.</p> <p>Then there's the Robbie Williams connection. A question about epic darting rivalries is somehow diverted into a lengthy revelry on staying with his Stokie homeboy in LA. Pressed on his battles with Dennis Priestley, Taylor instead directs me towards the Brit award nestling next to his darts silverware on the sideboard: \"That's his award on there. Best Song. He gave it to me.\"</p> <p>This is the odd thing about The Power. He doesn't live in exile in Marbella, or hide behind out of town gates. He lives in a cosy semi, the family pad of a pre-Premier League footballer. He makes much of his down-home qualities, and remains thoroughly local, a backyard superstar, well-liked by the mini-cab drivers who ferry me to and from his house and have only positive things to say about their resident champ.<br> But he's also really interested in famous people. He can't help himself. If anything it makes him more likeable, adding a slightly goofy quality. There's an awkward moment when he makes a big thing of calling John Terry only to find the number no longer works. Must have lost his phone or something, we agree, sadly.</p> <p>Probably the drive for success, and that strange blend of feet-on-the-ground and celebrity titillation all have some basis in Taylor's pre-darting life. He comes from famously humble beginnings. His family lived in a house with an upper floor that had been condemned; electricity was siphoned through the wall from next door.</p> <p>As a child Taylor developed his hand-eye co-ordination in the same way as Don Bradman, with long hours on his own spent pinging a golf ball against a garden wall. Taylor was a bowler (\"nothing special, just medium\") and thinks he could have taken it somewhere if he'd concentrated properly.</p> <p>Instead the early years were spent getting on his feet and raising his own young family. Amazingly, he didn't throw a dart until he was 26, having been encouraged to get out to the local pub by his wife, Yvonne. What, you wonder, was he doing with all that focus before he found darts? \"I was weight-lifting,\" he says, unexpectedly. \"I used to body build six or seven days a week. I was really, really fit. I wasn't naturally talented but I was fanatical at it. That's the problem with me, I've got a one-track mind.\"</p> <p>Having arrived at the oche late it only took him two years to win his first trophy, the Canadian Open. \"The first year I played for fun,\" he says. \"The second year I took it serious. I started beating the best players, county players and then I started thinking, I can make a living at this.\"</p> <p>Taylor was famously spotted, and sponsored, by Eric Bristow, who he describes now as \"like my brother\". He says it wasn't until he won his first world championship in 1990, beating Bristow 6-1 in the final, that he felt he'd arrived. \"That year I was with the BDO I won something like 48 out of 50 tournaments,\" he remembers. \"I went from earning \u00a374 a week to maybe \u00a350,000-\u00a360,000.\"</p> <p>Mention of the BDO casts a small shadow. Darts is a sport riven by its own internal apartheid, bleeding from the central fissure between dual governing bodies, a rift around which Taylor's career has been played out. Taylor was one of the top 16 players to jump ship from the BDO for the newly-founded PDC in 1992, encouraged by a new deal with Sky Sports that would take coverage of darts to a new level. A rapprochement between the two bodies still seems as far away as ever. </p> <p>\"I don't think it makes any difference now,\" Taylor shrugs. \"None at all. It doesn't bother me in the slightest. But I still think the BDO are fools for not joining forces. They have got a great structure for bringing players through the rankings. But the players reach a certain standard and they join the PDC because they can't earn a living there. I don't see any promotion at the BDO. I don't see anything being done really.\"</p> <p>It's tempting to wonder if he has any regrets at all: in particular about not being on the BBC, as the BDO world championship is, and finding the recognition outside the sport, the gongs and annual awards, that being a corporation face seems to bring. \"No, I don't,\" he says. \"One thing I am grateful for is that my kids have had a normal life. If I'd have been on ITV or BBC, perhaps we would have had to have a house with a wall around it and electric fencing. I've earned a great living and I don't get the hassle.</p> <p>Taylor was one of 10 nominees for the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award in 2006. It went to Zara Phillips. Did that get to him? \"Noooo. Being a nominee was good enough for me. Anyway Joe [Calzaghe] won it last year and he's on Sky. They've got to start recognising people from other sports. But I don't let it bother me. If I did I'd probably crack up,\" he chuckles, not entirely convincingly.</p> <p>Taylor has suggested he might retire in 2012, but, true to form, he seems quite prepared to backtrack on that. \"What I said was I'd think about it,\" he says. \"I've got a deal with my sponsors that runs out then. I might keep going. We'll see.\"</p> <p>You wonder whether Taylor would be prepared to fade away gently, in the style of Steve Davis, a one-time colossus becalmed in middle-age and losing in the early rounds to opponents he would have swatted aside in his youth. \"No. I couldn't do that. I don't think so. I think it would break my heart. Let's see how it goes. If they start beating me I'll find a way to beat them back. I'll hit them with my walking stick.\"</p> <p>The only time Taylor really settles down to talking darts and stops trying to change the subject to how hard he's been working creosoting his fence or his nascent friendships with Premier League footballers is when the world championship is mentioned.</p> <p>\"Yes, I want it again,\" he says, producing the full-on cold-eyed Taylor stare for the first time. \"I've not won it for two years. I really want to win the world championship. I really want it. I think this year's my best chance. All my gym work, all my training. It's all geared to that. I want it back.\"</p> <p>Never mind JT, Robbie, turnips and all the rest of it.

  "<p>Hot foot from addressing the annual meeting of the British Computing Society, Google's chief evangelist, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinton_Cerf \">Vint Cerf</a>, popped into Guardian Towers for a quick Q&amp;A with staff yesterday.</p> <p>Over the course of an hour and half, Vint wrestled with subjects as broad as Ricky Martin, AI, the BBC and the future of the internet. Here is an edited snapshot of the discussion...</p> <p><strong>Livin la Vida Loca</strong></p> <p>Vint starts by showing us a new toy to demonstrate how the computing power and the net was spreading beyond fixed terminals to independent devices (more on this later). He puts the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTxdKi77G20\">Sony Rolly</a> on the desk and lets it go, and the device begins dancing to, and playing, Ricky Martin.<br><em><br>\"Clearly we have reached a point where computing has invaded nearly everything.\"</em></p> <p><strong>What's going to happen to the internet?</strong></p> <p><em>\"It's pretty clear that the openness of the network, the ability to put new applications on it openly and freely has been an important engine, certainly Google wouldn't exist if Larry and Sergey [Page and Brin - Google founders] hadn't just built this thing and tried it out. The same is true with Jerry [Yang, founder] at Yahoo.</em></p> <p><em>\"I hope that openness is maintained but like every medium the internet can be abused when we think about it we can commit fraud locally and internationally using the telephone system and postal service.</em></p> <p><em>\"We can perpetrate a variety of crimes and in every instance where we have had a technology like that ultimately society has said there are certain constraints, certain behaviours we will consider to be antisocial, we may not be able to prevent this happening but we will choose to have consequences if we catch you. So I won' t be surprised if there are national and international agreements reached about certain unacceptable behaviours on the net and they will be enforced to one degree or another. At the same time the technology is strikingly easy to replicate, it was designed to be that way, and so the consequences and the attempts to constrain the network are often stymied as it's possible to build another piece that is more open, for example. Even in places like China where its very clear there is state censorship, knowledgeable people know how to tunnel their way out of the constraining part.</em></p> <p><em>\"So I have this almost schizoid hope that we deal with some of the abuses in the net and at the same time we don't lose this very open environment so that information sharing remains as open as it has been.\"</em></p> <p><em>\u2026\u2026</em></p> <p><em>\"Apart from this governance question people wonder what technologically is going to happen.

It might not happen right there, it might happen another place on the network, we may feel that this system is more intelligent because we are interacting with it in ways that don't require us to point, click and type.

  "<p>In his speech at the Unite reception on Saturday night, Gordon Brown did not mince his words about London's mayor, criticising Boris Johnson's ill-judged speech in China after the Olympics closing ceremony \u2013 and rounding on Johnson's plans to increase fares above inflation while cancelling the planned charge on gas guzzlers. The fact that the prime minister chose the annual Labour conference event of the biggest trade union in Britain to signal a hardening in the government's line towards the mayor gives his remarks added weight. He laid into Johnson in similar terms at the London Labour gathering the same evening. </p> <p>Until now the government has understandably remained cautious about attacking a mayor with a still-new mandate. The prime minister's comments show that he has concluded that Johnson's administration has enough wrong with it to help make broader points about the Tories. </p> <p>The mayor and his team seem to have gone out of their way over the last few days to give Brown plenty of grist to his mill. Since late on Saturday night Johnson's administration has been all over the media with the story that Johnson has commissioned a feasibility study into a <a href=\"http://www.teaco.co.uk/\">harebrained scheme</a> for closing down Heathrow airport and building a new airport on an island in the Thames estuary. </p> <p>\"We're not proposing to switch the lights on at the new airport and switch the lights off at Heathrow, firing everyone overnight,\" Kit Malthouse, one of Boris Johnson's deputy mayors (his policing adviser in fact) <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article4794832.ece\"> told the Sunday Times</a>. \"This would be a phasing from one airport to the other. Over the space of three or four years, those [workers] that wanted to, could migrate.\" </p> <p>Johnson has in the past defined the \"Heathrow-by-Sea\" proposal as the <a href=\"http://www.stopboris.org/blog/2008/04/20/boriss-big-idea/\">big idea of his mayoralty</a>.</p> <p>Yet the estuary airport plan is a waste of London government's time and energy. Campaigners from local <a href=\"http://www.newsshopper.co.uk/news/localheadlines/display.var.2324191.0.boris_fails_to_rule_out_north_kent_airport.php\">Tory councillors</a>, to the Green party and the <a href=\"http://blogs.rspb.org.uk/news/archive/2007/08/08/Thames-estuary-airport-is-bonkers.aspx\"> RSPB</a> have successfully opposed the plans in the past. It is a huge disservice to environmental politics in Britain to have someone as prominent as the mayor of London pushing for a new airport. It would involve the destruction of valuable wildlife habitats. It is no way to respond to the question of global warming. It would cost billions and involve vast new transport infrastructure. It will appear a ridiculous and irritating diversion to many in business in London, who expect the mayor to deal with the most serious issues facing London, such as delivering Crossrail, in a coherent and thought-out way. It is at best a bizarre sideshow. </p> <p>For some time observers of City Hall have been <a href=\"http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-mayor/article-23526358-details/Boris,+beware+the+battle+of+the+egos/article.do\">warning</a> of the need for coherence and the dangers of a \"polycentric\" mayor's office. </p> <p>The Heathrow-by-Sea feasibility study is an indication that these problems are still not being addressed and an eccentric division of labour feeds the sense of incoherence. What does it say about the mayor's commitment to sorting out the problems at the top of the Met or dealing with teenage stabbings that the deputy mayor for policing is to lead a feasibility study into an airport? What do the mayor's transport and environment advisers think of it? </p> <p>Perhaps <a href=\"http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-mayor/article-23558648-details/Boris+slammed+over+plans+for+airport+in+Kent/article.do\">stung by the hostile reaction</a> from business, the mayor's team briefed <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7627926.stm\">BBC London</a> this week that the estuary airport would be in addition to Heathrow, not its replacement. No one seems to have told the island folly's <a href=\"http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-mayor/article-23558574-details/Great+idea%2C+Boris%2C+but+your+airport+can't+take+off/article.do\">most prominent supporters</a> of this latest nuance. It raises the question of what Johnson's deputy mayor was doing briefing the papers over the weekend that it would indeed replace Heathrow. And a proposal for a new airport in addition to Heathrow is a proposal for airport expansion however you dress it up; something that will give the Greens on the London assembly the <a href=\"http://london.greenparty.org.uk/news/752\">opportunity to land some telling blows</a>.</p> <p>As if the excursion to fantasy island wasn't doing enough damage the mayor has kept up the pace with an <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2008/09/23/do2301.xml\">article in the Telegraph</a> on the economy that <a href=\"http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-mayor/article-23558942-details/Boris%3A+Stop+neo-socialist+whingeing+about+City+bankers+and+house+prices/article.do\">the Evening Standard reports</a> \"has opened [him] up to accusations of being out of touch with normal Londoners struggling to cope with mortgage payments, and the rising cost of living in the capital.\"</p> <p>Mayor Johnson has undoubtedly enjoyed a honeymoon period, but some clear themes have started to solidify around his administration \u2013 an inadequate grasp of the key policy issues facing London; wasteful decisions that cost Londoners directly; chaotic structures for governing.

  "<p>ITV should be allowed to drop some regional news bulletins, reduce regional programming by 50% and cut back on some current affairs programmes, according to media regulator Ofcom, which has forecast that up to \u00a3235m per year will be needed by 2012 to maintain public service content on commercial TV.</p> <p>The proposals, <a href=\"http://comment.ofcom.org.uk/phase2summary/\" target=\"_blank\">revealed today in Ofcom's second review of public service broadcasting</a>, will please ITV, which wants to make \u00a340m a year in regional savings.</p> <p>Ofcom also found that public funding to the tune of \u00a3145m to \u00a3235m would be needed to maintain public service content provision beyond that of the BBC by 2012.</p> <p>This figure includes the \u00a360m to \u00a3100m <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/sep/17/channel4.ofcom\">Ofcom has already identified that Channel 4 needs</a> to plug its funding gap.</p> <p>Ofcom has proposed that ITV be allowed to reduce its public service broadcasting obligations from next year to make the provision of \"highly valued programmes\" - such as news, current affairs and UK originated content - more sustainable until the end of the current licence period in 2014.</p> <p>The media regulator's proposals give priority to peak-time news coverage.</p> <p>ITV would be allowed a \"modest reduction\" of regional news minutage, by dropping some daytime news bulletins, and slashing regional non-news programming by 50% to 15 minutes per week in England and 1.5 hours in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p> <p>The volume of current affairs programming in peak time will remain unchanged. However, the minimum outside of peak will fall by 40 minutes per week to a total of 50 minutes.</p> <p>ITV's fixed quota for programmes produced outside of London has been slashed from 50% to 35% under the proposals.</p> <p>This will in part be balanced by Channel 4 upping its out-of London quota from 30% to 35% from 2010 and a new quota commitment for productions sourced from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p> <p>ITV1's quotas for original UK productions, independent productions and national and international news will remain unchanged.</p> <p>Ofcom is also backing ITV proposals to restructure its regional news services as a \"credible means to sustain quality national and regional news services on ITV1\".</p> <p>ITV wants to rationalise news bulletins in the England and Scottish Borders region from 17 separate programmes to nine.</p> <p>The National Union of Journalists said that Ofcom has \"failed\" as a regulator and that the proposals could 500 editorial jobs could be cut from ITV regional operations.</p> <p>The NUJ said that the proposals would \"set in train the destruction\" of local and regional news and that ITV \"intends to make massive cuts to its regional news budgets that could see journalist numbers halved\".</p> <p>\"With ITV poised to begin making cuts before Ofcom even completes the consultation, the regulator's soft-touch approach has failed,\" said Jeremy Dear, general secretary of the NUJ. </p> <p>But ITV welcomed Ofcom's proposals.</p> <p>\"We welcome Ofcom's acknowledgement of the need to strike the right balance between these costs and benefits, which is reflected in its proposals for ITV's regional news services, regional non-news programmes and the out-of-London quota,\" said ITV in a statement. </p> <p>\"We have consistently argued that the regulatory costs and commercial benefits of holding the ITV licences need to be re-balanced between now and analogue switch off in 2012. Today's statement also sets out Ofcom's refined options for the longer term future of public service broadcasting to which the board of ITV will give careful consideration.\"</p> <p>ITV's share price climbed by almost 9% in early trading this morning, after Ofcom's proposals were revealed.</p> <p>The broadcaster's shares, which closed at 42.25p, saw a surge of 8.9% at just before 10am this morning, a 3.75p increase to 46p.</p> <p>ITV's share price had settled back to 44p, a 4.14% or 1.75p increase over last night's close, by 11.40am.</p> <p>Ofcom says that Channel Five's PSB remit should be focused on UK programmes, network news and children's programmes.</p> <p>The regulator proposes to reduce Five's current quota for original productions from 53% to 50%.</p> <p>\"Audiences value public service programming highly, but strong digital TV takeup means it is becoming harder for our leading commercial broadcasters to provide this,\" said Ed Richards, the chief executive of Ofcom. </p> <p>\"We have provided a clear set of choices for maintaining and strengthening public service broadcasting in the future. Along with our proposals in the short term, timely decisions by government and parliament will be critical.\"</p> <p>Ofcom has estimated that if UK audiences want to watch the same amount of public service content they have today, total public funding of between \u00a3330m and \u00a3420m will be required from 2012.</p> <p>Existing regulatory subsidisies, such as reserved spectrum and premium position on the electronic programme guide, will contribute around \u00a3185m.</p> <p>This leaves a funding gap of \u00a3145m to \u00a3235m.</p> <p>Within this Ofcom has already said that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/sep/17/channel4.ofcom\">Channel 4 will need between \u00a360m and \u00a3100m a year by 2012</a>.</p> <p>\"After 2012 it is increasingly difficult to be precise about funding requirements given the uncertainty about the wider media environment,\" said Ofcom.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/sep/17/ofcom.television\">Ofcom has proposed three possible funding models for the \"post-switchover world\"</a>.</p> <p>Possible sources of funding include direct public funding, Channel 4 getting a stake in BBC Worldwide and the use post-2012 of the \u00a3130m per year \"excess\" licence fee settlement ringfenced to pay for digital switchover costs.</p> <p>Ofcom's consultation closes on December 4, with a final statement in early 2009.
