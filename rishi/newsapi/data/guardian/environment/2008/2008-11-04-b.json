(He is on around 63% to Obama's 34% - based on just under 8,000 votes.)</p> <p>So, not much to say yet.

Andrew Clark <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/nov/05/uselections2008-johnmccain\">interviewed him tonight outside his Ohio home</a> and heard his frustration at the way McCain thrust him into the spotlight.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I was unhappy that my name was used as much as it was because I think there were real other issues that should've been discussed during the debate,\" said Wurzelbacher. \"I was happy that I was used as a focal point but I didn't think I was going to be the only point.\"</p> <p>Seemingly disillusioned by his treatment during the election, Wurzelbacher continued: \"You know, fame is fleeting, leaves you hungry, leaves you cold, leaves you tired.

McCain projected to win Oklahoma and Tennessee. None of this too surprising.</p> <p>States too close to project, according to CNN, are Alabama, Florida, New Hampshire, Mississippi, Missouri and Pennsylvania.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>1:07am:</strong> MSNBC, PBS, Fox and Reuters are projecting Obama to win in Pennsylvania.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>1:14am:</strong> Over to Virginia - Mark Warner has won the state's Senate race, meaning it now has two Democratic senators and a Democratic governor. </p> <p>Here's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/nov/05/uselections2008-virginia\">the story</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>The popular former governor bested another former governor, Jim Gilmore, for a seat long in Republican hands. The Democratic party hopes that and a handful of other wins tonight will give them the 60-member supermajority that will allow them virtually to dictate legislative policy.</p> </blockquote> <p>Still left is to see which way Virginia's electoral college votes go. It is on Obama's list of possible pick ups, though hasn't voted Democratic in a presidential election since 1964.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>1:17am:</strong> Meanwhile in Kenya ... <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/nov/05/uselections2008-barackobama1\">Kenyans pray for victory in Barack Obama's ancestral home</a>.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>1:29am:</strong> Our Virginia senate story now takes in incumbent Republican senator Elizabeth Dole's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/nov/05/uselections2008-virginia\">defeat in North Carolina</a>.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>1:32am:</strong> We have a new lead story taking in Obama's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/nov/05/uselections2008-exit-polls\">projected win in Pennsylvania</a>.</p> <p>Here's <strong>Michael Tomasky</strong> on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/nov/05/pennsylvania\">Pennsylvania and other east coast states</a> key to Obama's White House bid:</p> <blockquote> <p>[On Pennsylvania] If Chuck Todd says it (he's with MSNBC), one tends to believe it. Pretty big news, obviously.</p> <p>Re Virginia: Remember that Norfolk-Virginia Beach-Hampton Roads haven't come in yet. Neither has northern Virginia. Those are Democratic strongholds. So Virginia will tighten considerably.</p> <p>Re Florida...surprising Obama margin so far. And historically, south Florida (Dem) reports later.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>1:46am: Julian Borger</strong> has the latest on the exit polls, and it is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/deadlineusa/2008/nov/05/us-election-democrats-women-husbands\">good news for Obama</a>: </p> <blockquote> <p>One in ten voters said they were voting for the first time, and those new voters were mostly young and/or black - demographics that are good for the Democratic candidate.</p> </blockquote> <p>But a note of caution from Borger: early exit polls tend to under-represent late-voting working men. The early exit polls in 2004 also showed things going well for John Kerry.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>1:57am:</strong> The last posting reminds me this is around the time in US elections British people traditionally go to bed thinking the Democrat's won. </p> <p>Here are some reasons to stick around:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/nov/05/uselections2008-barackobama\">Oliver Burkeman's liveblog</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/michaeltomasky\">Michael Tomasky's election night analysis</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/cifamerica/2008/nov/04/uselections2008\">Anna Pickard's live US TV review</a></p> <p>And, of course, seeing what happens ...</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>2:05am:</strong> More projections from recently closed states: Rhode Island, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota and New York for Obama; Wyoming and North Dakota for McCain. None of these are that surprising, but North Dakota was a state that flipped between toss-up and lean McCain over the last week.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>2:10am:</strong> McCain projected to win in Georgia - a usually reliably Republican state, though one which if Obama was having a better than expected night a large African American turnout could have conceivably put in the Democratic column.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>2:18am:</strong> The latest map.

For \u00a33,000 a \"reputable user\" \u2013 in other words, a supermarket or security firm - can buy a link to the DVLA database although they still pay the same fee for driver's details on top of that. </p> <p>Although the DVLA insists that it is not a making a profit on the 1.64 million sales per annum, which is hard to believe, the fact remains that a government agency is selling information about us to third parties who may have rather doubtful motives \u2013 like the Parking Eye company which sent an \u00a380 penalty notice to a <a href=\"http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/s/1066954_80_nightmare_for_tired_driver?rss=yes?rss=yes\">driver </a> who broke her late night journey on the M6 to take a nap in her car at Lymm services rather than continue and fall asleep at the wheel.</p> <p>But is not just the DVLA. In the summer the police <a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/07/30/commercial_access_dna_database/\">admitted</a> that samples from the national DNA database had been used for unspecified research. How much money changed hands, and what was the purpose of the research, are not known but this is the clearest indication that once the state acquires information \u2013 and here we are talking about the biological essence of thousands of people \u2013 it comes to think of it as its own, to do with it what it likes. </p> <p>The vast databases that are being hastily built before the public realises what it is losing represent an enormous commercial prize. The only people who will not benefit from the sale of our information are us, even though we will be supplying it \u2013 often under duress \u2013 to the government. We'll be soon be in the ridiculous position of giving up every important piece of information about ourselves, together with the right of access to that information, while commercial enterprise will purchase access for their own gain. It is a stark reminder how rapidly the relationship between state and individual has changed in the last decade.</p> <p>Who owns our personal information, what use they make of it, and what access the public should be allowed to its own data \u2013 to correct and formally withdraw it from the database - are issues which are hardly ever discussed by Davis's colleagues, who unthinkingly go along with the idea that possession is ninth-tenths of the law. </p> <p>But there is another route, which starts with each one of us declaring that our personal information is precisely that. It belongs to us and we should have control over it, wherever possible. What we need, but hear little suggestion of in Parliament, is a privacy law that entrenches these rights in the environment of a new Bill of Rights. For if there is one clear message to absorb about current situation in which the state plunders what it likes from our personal lives it is that the section that guarantees privacy in the Human Rights Act is a complete joke, and has in fact been the context in which this gross attack on all our privacy has taken place.</p>",
  "<p>In July 2007, the government set out its plans for 3m new homes by 2020 in the green paper <a href=\"http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/homesforfuture\">Homes for the future: more affordable, more sustainable</a>. In its latest report <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmenvaud.htm\">Greener homes for the future?</a> the <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/environmental_audit_committee.cfm\">Environmental Audit Committee</a> questioned whether the assumptions underpinning the targets, announced over 15 months ago, were still valid. The latest <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/nov/04/construction-housingmarket\">economic projections</a>, fundamental changes in the mortgage market, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/oct/31/house-prices-drop\">falling house prices</a> mean the government <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/nov/03/greenbuilding-ecotowns\">should urgently review</a> the assumptions on which the target was based. The government should ask the <a href=\"http://www.theccc.org.uk/\">Committee on Climate Change</a> to assess the impact housebuilding could have on carbon reduction targets. In reviewing its targets, the government must not dilute its environmental ambitions, but should invest in the skills and supply chains needed to deliver a step change in environmental construction standards.</p> <p>The government now has the opportunity to strengthen the environmental credentials of its housing policy. For example, the government's target for 3m new homes is split; 2m homes are to be built before the zero carbon target comes into effect in 2016, and 1m are to be built afterwards. Changing the balance, so that more homes are built after the zero carbon target comes into effect, could help to limit emissions from a growth in housing. The government could also accelerate the development of district renewable energy sources to ensure that new developments can source their heat and power from renewable sources. Instead of rating homes against the <a href=\"http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/england/professionals/en/1115314116927.html\">Code for Sustainable Homes</a>, the government could make it mandatory to build to aspects of the code from 2010 onwards. The government could place greater emphasis on energy efficiency and sustainability within the building control regime, and introduce higher penalties for developers who fail to meet energy efficiency standards.</p> <p>Good progress has been made on brownfield development, but pressure on greenfield sites is growing. Current policy, combined with high national housebuilding targets and current regional plans, could make it impossible for local authorities to prevent planning permission being granted for development on land that, because of the current economic situation, is not actually needed. Presented with an excess of available land, developers might develop greenfield sites in preference to brownfield sites. The government should ensure that an excess of land is not made available to developers and a clear sequential test in favour of brownfield development should be reintroduced into planning policy. </p> <p>The environmental tests used for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/ecotowns\">ecotowns</a> should be applied to all major housing developments from 2016. The government must ensure proposals for ecotowns have good public transport links, and are located close to commercial centres and employment opportunities. The government has recently devoted considerable attention to delivering the infrastructure for sustainable new communities. The government should ensure that minimum standards for public transport and green infrastructure apply to all new developments, not just ecotowns. </p> <p>The current economic crisis, with the implications it is likely to have for house prices and access to credit, means that a re-evaluation of housebuilding plans is urgently needed. This re-evaluation is an opportunity to make housing policy greener and move us along the path towards a low-carbon future.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marksspencer\">Marks &amp; Spencer</a> has reassured investors that it has no plans to slash its dividend despite reporting first-half profits down by more than 30%. </p> <p>The pledge coupled with higher-than-expected profits sent the shares to the top of the FTSE leader board, bouncing 11% to 246.5p. By the close the company's shares were up nearly 8% to 238.5p. </p> <p>Analysts insist M&amp;S will have to cut its dividend either this year or next, given the marked deterioration in profitability. But M&amp;S's finance and operations director, Ian Dyson, insisted: \"There is no change in the dividend policy and no plans to change it.\"</p> <p>Dyson's reassurances came as the retailer reported profits of \u00a3297.8m in the six months to September 27, down from \u00a3451.8m a year ago. The performance beat analyst estimates of around \u00a3290m. </p> <p>The retailer confirmed it would pay an interim dividend of 8.3p, providing relief for its legions of small shareholders who have seen the value of their shares halve this year.</p> <p>M&amp;S executive chairman, Sir Stuart Rose, blamed the wider economy for the profit slump: \"The UK economy is having a very difficult time and we can't defy gravity. If I believed we had a bad business plan I would change it.\"</p> <p>He said the economic environment had changed dramatically in the past year and it was encountering the \"most difficult retail conditions since the early 90s. M&amp;S is a very strong business in a very weak economy.\" </p> <p>M&amp;S said trade over the last month had been \"volatile\" as consumer confidence was rocked by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">financial crisis</a> that has seen high street banks topple. To counteract the downturn the retailer plans to cut costs but promised \"no major redundancies\" were planned.</p> <p>Rose said erratic trading patterns made Christmas difficult to call. Analysts are anticipating the worst trading conditions for a generation as consumers juggle rising living costs with nervousness surrounding the economic outlook. \"Interest rates should come down so hopefully we will see some blue sky towards the end of 2009,\" he added.</p> <p>M&amp;S will try to attract shoppers to its stores with a Christmas advertising campaign featuring boyband Take That and TV actor Robson Green as well as regular M&amp;S faces Twiggy and Erin O'Connor. </p> <p>The retailer said it had benefited from a tight rein on costs and lower prices which boosted the top line - total sales were up 1% at \u00a34.2bn. However underlying sales - a key measure of a retailer's health - were down 5.7% over the half. Analysts expect M&amp;S to make profits of \u00a3667m in the current year, compared with \u00a31bn.</p> <p>Rose said its womenswear and menswear businesses were \"stable\" after recent market share data suggested they had lost ground to rivals over the summer. The retailer made market share gains in lingerie and childrenswear. Underlying sales at the clothing and homewares division were down 6.2%.</p> <p>Of more concern is the recent performance of the retailer's food business where profits and market share are falling as rising food prices encouraged customers to trade down to cheaper stores as well as discounters such as Aldi. </p> <p>To improve its value credentials the retailer has cut the price of over 500 food products and introduced promotions such as 'Dine in for \u00a310'. Rose said John Dixon, who took over as head of food earlier this year, was getting to grips with empty shelves and was confident customers would seek out its Christmas fare. M&amp;S said food inflation in its stores was below 3%.</p> <p>Last month M&amp;S dramatically scaled back its spending plans for this year and next, a decision that has put the brakes on a costly store refurbishment programme and curtailed UK expansion plans. </p> <p>However it is pressing on in international markets with plans to open 15 stores in India over the next two years. It recently made its market debut in China, opening its first store in Shanghai in October. Rose believes the international arm has the potential to account for a fifth of sales.</p> <p>Panmure Gordon analyst Philip Dorgan said the performance of M&amp;S's UK store business was worse than expected, adding he still expected the dividend to be cut at the final stage.</p>",

  "<p>How does a party so closely wedded to a discredited economic orthodoxy find the political will to renew itself after years of incumbency?</p> <p>No, that's not a hypothetical for Republicans to ponder on the day of the US elections, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/joncruddas\">Jon Cruddas</a>'s succinct summary of the dilemma facing New Labour at last night's Comment is Free/<a href=\"http://www.soundings.org.uk/\">Soundings</a> debate, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/series/whoownstheprogressivefuture\">After New Labour</a>.</p> <p>Any retreat to the party's old Labour comfort zone would be an inadequate response to today's challenges and lack credibility from a party that has so unashamedly championed market liberalisation. Instead a panel that stretched from Harriet Harman to <a href=\"http://www.opendemocracy.net/ \">openDemocracy</a> author Jeremy Gilbert and the hot hope of the <a href=\"http://www.compassonline.org.uk\">Compass</a> group <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/nov/01/2\">Chuka Umunna</a>, grappled with how the party's traditional values of economic and social solidarity could be realised in dramatically changed circumstances.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/madeleinebunting\">Madeleine Bunting</a>, in the chair, did her best to make everyone feel an Obama moment. But Cruddas struck a note of scepticism. The financial crisis fills him with \"foreboding\" rather than \"confidence\", he said, as history shows it is nearly always the right that gains in tough times as voters turn to a \"sour politics of identity\" in search of a quick fix. Recent attempts to compare Gordon Brown with Roosevelt ignore the fact there is no ready-made framework for the party to turn to, although Cruddas says progressive taxation, a radical social housing plan, a new regulatory regime, a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/17/globaleconomy-banking\">Green New Deal</a> and scrapping Trident and ID cards to fund a \"new military covenant\" and more police all provide \"illustrative examples\" of whose side the party should be on. </p> <p>Harriet Harman was in a clear minority in the room when she suggested the debate should be about \"building on New Labour\" rather than surpassing it. It was the Labour party's experience of opposition in the 1980s, she said, which led to the creation of New Labour as a \"delivery mechanism\" for Labour values \u2013 and a sign of its success that David Cameron has had to shift his party onto centre-left terrain to compete.</p> <p>The recent focus on the economy has sometimes obscured the fact that the current crisis is also a failure of the political system itself. There were signs Harman grasped this when she spoke of \"refreshing democracy\" and \"opening out politics to the people\", but how this would be done was left unclear (certainly there was no mention of the floundering <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article5063250.ece\">Governance of Britain</a> agenda with which Brown launched his premiership). </p> <p>Umunna, the young Labour candidate for Streatham, had a clearer sense of what's needed when he described the adversarial politics of PMQs as \"awful\" and advocated electoral reform. This is a second chance to make the case for collectivism after 1997, he warned, and it won't last long. But his was still a traditional collectivist versus individualist framework. Words like freedom or liberty, which might reach out to the uncommitted public, were notably absent.</p> <p>Academic and activist <a href=\"http://www.uel.ac.uk/ssmcs/staff/jeremy-gilbert/\">Jeremy Gilbert</a> took issue with Harman's claim that the New Labour government has been informed by collectivist values. It has, he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/28/economy-creditcrunch\">argued</a>, capitulated to neo-liberalism, seeing its role as \"merely to equip individuals to compete in the global marketplace\". New Labour's failure is not simply the cultural one defined by Umunna of failing to challenge an \"individualist national psyche\" entrenched by Thatcher: it is a failure to change material conditions.<br> Thatcher's \"brilliant strategic move\" was to sell off council houses, which in one swoop transformed a generation of working-class Labour supporters into a class of property speculators, creating strong pressure on government to maintain Thatcherite policies.</p> <p>But New Labour refused to build any democratic counterweight to the power of finance capital, instead clinging to the \"Fabian fallacy\" that a benign and omniscient government could fix things from Whitehall. Polly Toynbee and others are wrong to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/28/economics-labour-conservatives-keynes\">herald</a> a new era of Keynesianism, according to Gilbert. The conditions don't exist any longer for the kind of approach that made social democratic politics possible after the second world war. </p> <p>At the end of a lively debate Madeleine Bunting took a straw poll to gauge whether the audience were more or less optimistic \u2013 even slightly \u2013 based on what they had just heard. The vote was more or less evenly split. Quite a few abstained. She cheerfully reported that the glass was half full.</p>",

  "<p>The National Union of Journalists is to ballot its members in ITV regional news on strike action after it said the broadcaster had refused to enter formal conciliation over job cuts.</p> <p>ITV announced in September that it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/sep/30/itv.downturn\">planned to cut 429 editorial posts from its regional news operation</a> in a bid to make cost savings of \u00a340m a year.</p> <p>The NUJ said today it would ballot its members - who represent around 20% of ITV news group staff - in a bid to get a \"fair deal for all those affected by the cuts\" and was looking for improved voluntary redundancy terms and guarantees around working hours, pay and staffing in the new structure.</p> <p>In an attempt to reach an agreement with ITV, the NUJ said it had offered to take the dispute to the independent conciliation service Acas. </p> <p>\"However, the company has rejected the union's suggestion, leaving little option but to begin a ballot for industrial action,\" the union said in a statement.</p> <p>The NUJ said the postal ballot would open on Monday and close two weeks later on November 24. </p> <p>NUJ broadcasting organiser, Paul McLaughlin, said: \"We will not participate in the wholesale destruction of ITV local and regional news. The current offer from ITV is simply not good enough to deal with members' concerns. </p> <p>\"We are determined to win improvements through a negotiated settlement but a refusal to go to Acas has left the union with no option but to begin a ballot for strike action.\"</p> <p>An ITV spokesman responded: \"We were naturally disappointed that the NUJ chose to pull out of talks, ordered regional representatives to stop attending local discussions and have now notified ITV of the intention to ballot for industrial action.</p> <p>\"We believe that the talks had made good progress which had resulted in ITV tabling a number of improvements during the consultation process. </p> <p>\"We were about to enter into further discussions when regrettably the NUJ demanded that the process be stopped and ended talks.</p> <p>\"We remain committed to an ongoing and constructive dialogue with the unions and are pleased that the NUJ has indicated that it is now prepared to meet ITV regional directors in an attempt to resolve outstanding issues. </p> <p>\"We will be seeking to arrange these meetings as soon as possible to ensure that this important process isn't delayed any further.\"</p> <p>Fellow broadcasting union Bectu has urged ITV and the NUJ to resolve their differences as soon as possible.</p> <p>Bectu supervisory official David Beevers said: \"Whilst Bectu respects the NUJ's right to register a dispute, and we will not continue talks with ITV plc on this issue whilst the dispute remains in place, Bectu believes that valuable time will be lost, and opportunities missed, if the redundancy talks do not resume at the earliest point.</p> <p>\"Bectu members are every bit as affected by ITV's pitiful commitment to regional news as their NUJ colleagues. However, our members want us to keep talking to the company to see what further improvements can be secured.\"</p> <p>\"We look to the NUJ to ensure that their strategy does not exacerbate the uncertainty for all staff affected by these critical changes.\"</p> <p>Ofcom is currently consulting on whether to allow ITV to cut its regional news output and is due to report in the new year.</p> <p>The NUJ has previously criticised ITV for pushing ahead with the cuts in advance of the regulator's final decision.</p> <p>ITV's announcement of job cuts followed Ofcom's green light to the broadcaster to reduce its regional programming by 50%, including cutbacks of some current affairs programmes.</p> <p>The broadcaster wants to rationalise news bulletins in England, Wales and the Scottish Borders region from 17 separate programmes to nine.</p> <p>Under the plans, the Border region will merge with Tyne Tees, West with Westcountry, and Meridian with Thames Valley. </p> <p>In each case, there will be a 15-minute slot for more localised news. In other regions, this \"opt out\" will be shorter, at around six minutes. ITV will also be able to merge its studios to save money.</p> <p>As part of its cost-cutting plan, ITV said it expected to cut about 1,000 posts in total - almost a fifth of its 5,500-strong workforce. </p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p>Lap-dancers are visiting Downing Street today in a bid to block plans to class them as part of the sex industry.</p> <p>Two workers from the club chain Spearmint Rhino are representing several companies as they take a petition to Number 10 to protest at the proposals made by a backbench Labour MP.</p> <p>Roberta Blackman-Woods, who represents Durham, wants to see the clubs reclassified as \"sex encounter establishments\", which would make it easier for local councils to refuse licences.</p> <p>Spearmint Rhino spokeswoman Elaine Reed said: \"The workers within our industry are absolutely horrified that the government are trying to rebrand us as part of the sex industry.</p> <p>\"It's quite clear we are not part of the sex industry, we never have been and we don't intend to be.</p> <p>\"Our clubs are controlled, there's no sexual activity going on.\"</p> <p>She said the club's dancers would feel stigmatised if classified as sex workers.</p> <p>\"They will leave the industry because they don't want that tag. The feeling is that if these changes are made the whole face of the industry will change, and not for the better.\"</p> <p>Susan Hall, head of environment services at Harrow council, said: \"Councils have long wanted discretionary powers to close down the loophole that allows lap-dancing clubs to spring up in blatantly unsuitable areas.</p> <p>\"This is not about the right of lap-dancing clubs to exist - we don't believe in being a nanny state and adults can make their own choices about entertainment.</p> <p>\"But councils should have more of a determining say if, for example, a club decides to open in a residential area.</p> <p>\"This can be a particular problem in London where you have residential areas with populations from different backgrounds and cultural traditions.\"</p> <p>A Home Office spokesman said: \"The government acknowledges that existing provisions to regulate lap-dancing clubs under the Licensing Act 2003 do not facilitate local communities' objections based on the location or the number of lap-dancing clubs in one area.</p> <p>\"That is why, following a consultation with local authorities, the home secretary recently announced that the government would take the necessary steps to give a stronger say to local people over the establishment of lap-dancing clubs is their area.</p> <p>\"The majority of local authorities that responded to the government consultation suggested that they would like to see lap-dancing clubs placed under the category of sex encounter establishments, as defined under the Local Authorities (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982.</p> <p>\"This would provide them with more scope to control the establishment of lap-dancing clubs and consider the objections of local communities that go wider than the four licensing objectives within the Licensing Act 2003.</p> <p>\"The government is considering various options, including this one, and intends to introduce legislation as soon as the parliamentary timetable allows.\"</p> <p>Women's rights group the Fawcett Society will tomorrow urge companies to sign up to a new charter pledging to challenge the \"sex object\" culture at work, including entertaining clients at lap-dancing clubs.<br></p>",
  "<p>An interesting and wide-ranging speech last night at the Royal Society for the Arts (RSA) from Alan Davey, chief executive of Arts Council England. There was a lot of talk of \"a new era\" with promises of new artistic risk, excellence and innovation, and creating work that has \"authenticity and integrity\". The kind of guff that always sounds impressive in speeches, but doesn't actually mean a great deal when you think about afterwards.</p> <p>But there was some real substance here, too, including a very public throwing down of the gauntlet to Andy Burnham, the secretary of state for culture, to keep the government promise that there will be no further diversion of National Lottery money to contribute to the cost of the Olympics. \"Not a penny more can we give,\" declared Davey, saying that he knew how the government worked and that pressure would be bought to bear. \"Secretary of state, you will have to show courage, leadership and principle and fight for what we do in the arts because in the times we are living in, the arts matter more than ever. There will be pressure to cut, but I'd argue that now is the time to expand.\"</p> <p>There was other interesting stuff too, including the announcement that the Arts Council has launched its consultation on self-assessment and peer review. Both include a range of proposals and people will have until January 23 2009 to make submissions on how they want it to work. The document is on the <a href=\"http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/consultation\">Arts Council website</a>, and although I haven't had a chance to have a good look (as I'm off to the Peter Brook awards today), it is really crucial that we all do. </p> <p>During the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/theatreblog/2007/dec/27/bleakfutureforthearts\">funding debacle</a> last Christmas, the two words being used again and again by artists were, \"peer review\". It does look as if we're going to get it, and so we must make sure that it is in a form that is really going to work. Sometimes we are quite good at moaning, less so at taking action; this is a chance to really shape the future. It is crucial that the Arts Council gets it right, and that means serious input from theatre-makers, producers and other funders.</p> <p>The other thing from the speech that requires attention is the announcement that the Arts Council will be looking to create new-style funding agreements. \"I want us to look at loosening the uniform three-year cycle, and examine instead a range of funding possibilities, with some bodies on longer term arrangements than now, and some on more flexible, shorter term arrangements,\" declared Davey. Again, it is going to be very important to watch how this develops. Details will apparently be up on the website next week. </p> <p>I suspect that we may well be returning to all the issues raised in Davey's speech several times over the next couple of months. It's good to see him demanding courage from Andy Burnham; if the Arts Council and Alan Davey are really going to create a new environment for arts funding and a new grown-up relationship, then that requires courage from artists and the Arts Council alike.</p>",
  "<p>Just one of the 12 sites competing to become one of Gordon Brown's ecotowns is currently considered suitable by the government's green consultants.</p> <p>Experts say 10 more might make the grade with further work, but appear to have ruled out one of the most controversial contenders, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/jun/25/architecture.ecotowns\">Weston Otmoor in Oxfordshire</a>. The consultants said the site would need \"substantial and exceptional innovation\" to make it work.</p> <p>The assessments of strengths and weaknesses made for ministers by Scott Wilson, a design, planning and environmental consultancy, point to difficulties over transport, particularly regarding overcrowded roads and car dependency, at some potential sites. The proximity of rail stations in other cases is regarded as a plus. Further schemes would involve the loss of large greenfield areas and there are doubts about whether some sites would be able to develop their own independent identity.</p> <p>Margaret Beckett, the housing minister, conceded that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jun/23/greenbuilding.greenpolitics\">some of the remaining shortlisted schemes could struggle to meet the standards</a> required, refuelling speculation that the government will not manage to build the maximum of 10 new towns for England that it originally hoped to have nearing completion or well under way by 2020.</p> <p>The government insists a new round of consultation on the sites, from which a final selection will be made early next spring, emphasises the determination of ministers to pursue the programme. Some promoters whose schemes were shortlisted in April have already dropped out, but three projects have become late additions: Newton-Bingham in Nottinghamshire, for which the Crown Estate is a partner, a local authority sponsored scheme at Rackheath, northeast of Norwich, and a site northwest of Bicester in Oxfordshire.</p> <p>The Bicester site is regarded by Scott Wilson as a better prospect than Western Otmoor, where Tim Henman's father has been among the most prominent opponents. Only the Rackheath proposal, near Norwich, has been given a grade A in the sustainability appraisal. Ten sites fall into the B category where planning and design improvements might yet make them work. The Weston Otmoor site gets the lowest grading of C because it is almost entirely green field and includes high grade agricultural land, ancient woodland and sites of special scientific interest. It is also so near to major roads that it would encourage commuting.</p> <p>The government today cautioned against making assumptions over which sites would be dropped. Beckett, who confirmed that the new zero-carbon towns would include 40% green space, said: \"It is vital we get locations for these ecotowns right, and the shortlist has been refined to reflect the results of the most detailed assessment to date on these potential locations. But I do not expect all of these locations to go forward. The ecotown standards are tough and I think some of these shortlisted schemes could struggle to meet them.\"</p> <p>Despite the fact that all the candidates will have to go through local planning processes, the government still hopes its ecotown programme could start in 2010. That would mean the first five would be well under development by 2015, with the others following by 2020. Ministers have always insisted 10 is the maximum they hope to create but Beckett has appeared more willing to lower expectations about the final figure than her predecessors.</p> <p>Bard, a group which has mounted a legal challenge to an ecotown at Middle Quinton, near Stratford-upon-Avon, warned that the government was continuing the countdown towards a decision \"knowing all the documents may have to be ripped up and the process started again\" because of the court action.</p> <p>However a coalition of environmental, housing and \"social justice\" organisations said ecotowns could provide affordable housing for tens of thousands of people while setting new standards for the total of 3m new homes the government has long said are needed by 2020.</p> <p>Gideon Amos, chief executive of the Town and Country Planning Association, said: \"While some sites will need to be further tested against agreed plans, the truth is that standards already set for ecotowns far outstrip those for any other development.\"</p> <p>Adam Sampson, chief executive of charity Shelter, said: \"We must not let the voices of those opposing the planned ecotowns drown out those of people in housing need.\"</p> <p><strong>The current shortlist of 12 potential locations for ecotowns is:</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Rackheath, Greater Norwich: Grade A<br>\u2022 Middle Quinton, Warwickshire: Grade B<br>\u2022 Newton-Bingham (Rushcliffe), Nottinghamshire: Grade B<br>\u2022 Ford, West Sussex: Grade B<br>\u2022 Bordon-Whitehill, Hampshire: Grade B<br>\u2022 St Austell (China Clay Community), Cornwall: Grade B<br>\u2022 Rossington, South Yorkshire: Grade B<br>\u2022 North East Elsenham, Essex: Grade B<br>\u2022 Pennbury, Leicestershire: Grade B<br>\u2022 Marston Vale, Bedfordshire: Grade B<br>\u2022 Weston Otmoor, Oxfordshire: Grade C<br>\u2022 North West Bicester (Cherwell) \u2013 alternative to Weston Otmoor: Grade B</p> <p><strong>Grade A:</strong> generally suitable for an ecotown</p> <p><strong>Grade B:</strong> might be a suitable location subject to meeting specific planning and design objectives</p> <p><strong>Grade C:</strong> location only likely to be suitable as an ecotown with substantial and exceptional innovation</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/02/saudiarabia-creditcrunch\">Gordon Brown's tour of the Gulf</a>, seeking money to bolster IMF funds, suggests his plans for a Bretton Woods II conference are less ambitious than the occasion requires. </p> <p>Brown says he's confident that the Saudis will assist with bolstering the IMF coffers \u2013 allowing it to lend to more cash-strapped economies like Iceland, Hungary, Pakistan and Ukraine. Good news for the IMF, which has suffered dry years as emerging lenders sprung up in the developing world and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/29/imf-iceland-recession-crunch\">potential recipients shun the fund</a>, justly frightened and indignant by the economic policies that will be foisted on them as a result of borrowing.</p> <p>But resuscitation of the fund \u2013 and the wider Bretton Woods system \u2013 is decidedly not good for a more stable and equitable world. When <a href=\"Brown http://www.brettonwoodsproject.org/art-562756\">joined other world leaders</a> in calling for a Bretton Woods II conference, many hoped that this might signal fundamental reform of the \"Washington Consensus\" ideology which lies behind the international financial institutions and which has landed us in the current mess. The fear is now that what Brown and others mean by such reform is simply acknowledging the new global balance of power by allowing a handful of new countries \"into the club\".</p> <p>Last week <a href=\"http://www.choike.org/bw2/index.html\">over 700 organisations from around the world signed a statement</a> calling for fundamental reform of the Bretton Woods institutions (notably IMF and World Bank). This must include reform of tax, lending, banking and trade systems \u2013 and a total re-think of the role of the state in the economy. The actions of western governments' intervening to prop up their own economies is alone surely proof of the bankruptcy of these policies. </p> <p>But in order to achieve this, it is essential to include those who have suffered most and had least say in the economic system up to now: poorer developing countries and representatives of citizens groups, social movements and trade unions. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_world_business/view/384651/1/.html\">G20 meeting in Washington DC on November 15</a> has been posited as the first step on the path to reform. Unfortunately, most countries in the world won't be there. As such the conference can only be a first step towards what is needed, but it would be worthwhile nonetheless if it helps western leaders see what a critical condition the economic system is in. </p> <p>It isn't a matter of resuscitation, the Bretton Woods institutions as currently constituted must be consigned to history and a new economic system be created on a very different sort of power dynamic. <br><em><br>Read more on the <a href=\"http://www.jubileedebtcampaign.org.uk/\">Jubilee Debt Campaign</a> website.</em></p>",
  "<p>Thames Water is proposing a massive new scheme called the <a href=\"http://www.thameswater.co.uk/cps/rde/xchg/SID-C0E135CD-33153F32/corp/hs.xsl/6082_2874.htm\">Thames tunnel</a>. It will be a sewage tunnel running directly under the Thames. Sir Joseph Bazalgette's network of sewers was great in its day, they say. But we have moved on. It is time for an upgrade. A makeover. They didn't have flushing lavatories in the 1860s, you know. When we have heavy rain the system overloads and sewage pours into the river Thames. The problem must be solved.</p> <p>This all sounds reasonable enough, although Thames Water customers may blanch at being expected to pick up the \u00a32.5bn bill. But is the scheme really justified when the cost and disruption are fully considered? You can get a lot for \u00a32.5bn when you go shopping for environmental breakthroughs.</p> <p>The river Thames is already claimed by Thames Water to be among the cleanest rivers in Europe. The number of fish species in the Thames estuary has risen to a total of 125. But there is a problem for a few days a year when heavy rain causes litter and sewage to overflow, making an unpleasant experience for those who go rowing. The smell lingers for a while before the sewage naturally disperses. Of course we all want the Thames to be cleaner. Hammersmith and Fulham council runs a community payback scheme with the police where supervised groups of young offenders go down to the river bank and clear up rubbish. </p> <p>But the Thames tunnel does not represent value for money. The government is ordering Thames Water to undertake the work but are not financing it. So if it goes ahead, and with the cost added to our water bills, we would have essentially a stealth tax. The Consumer Council for Water has <a href=\"http://www.ccwater.org.uk/server.php?show=ConWebDoc.1802\">doubts</a>. They say: \"Low-income customers will be hit particularly hard. It will increase customers' water bills by an average \u00a343. We do not feel that the potential benefits justify the likely costs of the scheme.\" They add: \"The government's decision must be right for consumers and for the water environment: it should not be driven by fear of European commission proceedings.\"</p> <p>Thames Water acknowledges it will do little or nothing to reduce water leaks or flooding into our homes. Stopping flooding into basements should be a far higher priority, but instead that is left to a \"rolling programme\" to be eventually sorted out by 2035 while the funds go to the Thames tunnel.</p> <p>In fairness to Thames Water it points out that it has no choice. The government is forcing it to do its dirty work on its behalf. The reason the government is doing this is its craven acquiescence to EU directives, which other European countries only follow when it suits them.</p> <p>I should, as they say, declare an interest. I am a local councillor in London representing a riparian ward. The super sewer would mean digging up of a size of two or three football pitches, for a period of eight years. Probably in a public park. The scheme would create a huge stinking crater with severe traffic congestion for the surrounding locality. My ward is Ravenscourt Park in Hammersmith and Fulham. My people could be on the front line of the crater. But my point is not to engage in vulgar nimbyism (\"Please spare us. What about Duke's Meadow in Chiswick instead?\"). It is of solidarity with any riparian community whose leaves would be so disrupted were this misconceived project to carried out.</p> <p>The government intends to force the scheme through with a planning bill to set up a planning and infrastructure commission that would brush aside the normal requirement for elected councillors to agree planning permission. It doesn't need to persuade us. It doesn't don't need to offer any compensatory benefits to residents. It can just force the thing through. The timetable is for Thames Water to choose a site for the crater in 18 months, to go through the motions of planning permission in three years with the aim of starting construction in four years.</p> <p>Another problem is that Thames Water is a monopoly \u2013 although Ofwat is looking at plans to enable us to choose our water supplier \u2013 so there is not the pressure to find value for money. Just take a big engineering solution and force the customers to pay higher bills.</p> <p>For less than 1% of the cost Thames Water could instead have more skimmer vessels. Currently it has two \u00a34million vessels; Clearwater I and Clearwater II, which have been specially designed to collect litter from the river surface, swept into the Thames during heavy rainfall. It also has oxygenating vessels that improve the water quality and help fish to thrive. It could do far more of this to provide great benefit at very modest cost.</p> <p>One final word of warning to Thames Water if it decided to build the giant crater in Ravenscourt Park. Local residents include Radio 4 Today programme presenter John Humphrys. Does it really want to mess with him?</p>",

  "<p>Tony Travers on Mayor Johnson at <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/nov/04/ed-balls-poverty-wages\">Cif</a>: </p> <blockquote> <p>In a classic Blairite move, he has leaned to the centre-left, supporting the London Living Wage, giving reasonable prominence to the environment, and extolling a Keynesian boost to the capital's soon to be depressed economy. He has not proved to be the wicked racist foreseen by some. Most of the Livingstone multi-cultural events in Trafalgar Square continue unabated. He is backing Barack Obama to win today's US election.</p> </blockquote> <p>Joshing about \"Red Boris\" aside, I agree only up to a point. His line on festivals and Obama is partly pragmatic and about positioning, but also an attempt to express a social liberalism that doesn't jar with the economic variety he espouses. I'd call that more centre-right than centre-left and, for me, not yet convincing. But on the London Living Wage, he's way ahead of the Labour government. As David Hencke <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/nov/04/ed-balls-poverty-wages\">reports</a>, Ed Balls and Yvette Cooper have criticised it as neither \"necessary or appropriate\". In response, a statement from the Mayor's office says:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"If the government is serious about tackling the capital's obscene levels of poverty and deprivation, then it would join me in urging all London employers to accept the London living wage as the basic pay rate. London is one of the most expensive cities in the world to live and work and it is not only morally right to pay the living wage but also makes good business sense, contributing to better recruitment and retention of staff, higher productivity and a more loyal workforce with high morale.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Spot the progressive.</p>",
  "<p>The hard-pressed construction sector is suffering the biggest fall in activity since records began in 1997, a survey shows today, while the CBI and the housebuilding industry have both urged the Bank of England to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/interestrates\">slash interest rates</a> by a full percentage point on Thursday.</p> <p>The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply/Markit latest monthly construction index tumbled to 35.1 in October from 38.8 the month before. A number above 50 denotes expansion while a figure below this signifies contraction. </p> <p>This very weak figure follows a similarly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/nov/03/manufacturingdata-economics\">gloomy report for the manufacturing sector on Monday</a>. Both indicates their sectors to be in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/recession\">technical recession</a>, defined by a contraction lasting for six consecutive months.</p> <p>The Home Builders' Federation today called on the Bank's monetary policy committee to cut interest rates to 3.5% this week from their current level of 4.5% to assist the housing market. It then wants to see further cuts down to 2% as soon as possible. </p> <p>Stewart Baseley, HBF executive chairman said: \"The time has now come to cut interest rates decisively - and then ensure the cuts are passed on to consumers. The worsening state of the economy means that any lingering concerns about inflation are far outweighed by the need to boost the housing market, so critical to the health of the wider economy.\"</p> <p>\"We welcomed last month's government action to support the banking system which should bring some much needed stability and hopefully increase mortgage liquidity. But action from the Bank is also needed if we are to break the vicious downward spiral of sharply lower mortgage lending, falling housing transactions, falling prices, declining home buyer confidence and a worsening economic outlook,\" Baseley added.</p> <p>The CBI deputy director general, John Cridland, also demanded a one percentage point rate cut to cushion the UK from the full impact of the economic slowdown.</p> <p>\"The recession into 2009 will be both longer and deeper than expected, and we need the strong medicine of a full percentage point cut,\" Cridland said.</p> <p>The HBF also wants the government to use its influence with the banks to insist that rate cuts are passed on to homeowners if the benefits are to be felt. Yesterday a senior executive at HSBC suggested that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/nov/04/recession-interest-rates\">banks would not make mortgages cheaper even if rates are cut on Thursday</a>.</p> <p>The breakdown of the CIPS/Markit survey showed that housing construction yet again recorded the most dramatic fall out of the three construction sub-sectors. The housing sub-index dropped from 26.1 in September to 25.2 in October, although this was above the series low of 18.7 that was reached in July.</p> <p>\"There was no let-up in October for struggling constructors as the global economic and financial malaise continued to unnerve the sector,\" said Roy Ayliffe, director at CIPS. \"Concerned purchasing managers reported a new survey low in activity levels under the relentless onslaught of tightening credit conditions, plummeting confidence and high inflation.\"</p> <p>The report also showed that optimism about the future had weakened sharply while firms were cutting jobs at a record pace. Gemma Wallace, economist at Markit said: \"The mood was an understandably gloomy one in the UK construction economy during October. Total output and new order levels fell severely, sparking fears of a protracted recession in the sector.\"</p>",
  "<p>They have apples that taste of pineapple, apples that look like pears, apples that - in the right light and perhaps after a glass of cider - look like a pig's snout. Many are delicious straight from the tree while others need time to mature. Some are good only for pickling and might take out a tooth if you took a bite. </p> <p>A mind-boggling variety of apples is to be found sitting in wicker baskets in the top shed on the National Trust's Cotehele estate in Cornwall at this time of year. </p> <p>Orchards are always good places to be in the autumn, but there is a greater sense of optimism at Cotehele and other important English orchards this year after they received an important funding boost. </p> <p>Along with grander landscapes such as high moors, wetlands and estuaries, the traditional orchard was given a share of \u00a35m from <a href=\"http://www.english-nature.org.uk/About/countdown.htm\">Natural England's Countdown 2010 biodiversity action fund</a>. The Countdown campaign is part of a global movement aimed at halting the loss of important environments. </p> <p>The money will be used by a partnership of groups to find out how many traditional orchards and apple varieties there are in the country - nobody knows for sure - and to begin to record the flora and fauna to be found in them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-339307658\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2008/11/04/sorting1.jpg\" alt=\"Apples at Cotehele orchard\" width=\"140\" height=\"84\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>To mark the occasion, the Guardian was given a tour of the National Trust's \"mother orchard\" at Cotehele on the banks of the River Tamar on a suitably misty and mellow morning. </p> <p>Planted last winter, the mother orchard consists of 270 trees with 120 varieties typical to Cornwall and Devon growing on an eight-acre plot. The idea is to grow these trees to adulthood to make sure they are not lost, and then create more trees from them and reintroduce the rare ones to orchards and gardens. </p> <p>Some of the varieties here were down to their last few trees; others were thought to be extinct but were found hiding away in the corner of kitchen gardens. </p> <p>Chris Groves, the Trust's orchard officer, said the number of orchards across the country had declined by more than 50% in the last 50 years because of changing farming practices - including, in this part of the world at least, the halting of the tradition of part paying labourers in cider - and because of cheap imports. </p> <p>The result is that countless orchards have been lost - and the nearest supermarket to Cotehele is selling two types of apples: one red, one green, both from France. </p> <p>At Cotehele, by contrast, it is all about variety. The mother orchard is still in its infancy, the trees only waist or shoulder high, but this autumn Groves has harvested around 50 varieties of apples from the estate's old orchard.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-339307659\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2008/11/04/hand1.jpg\" alt=\"Apples at Cotehele orchard\" width=\"140\" height=\"84\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Some are named after the place they were first grown: the Plympton Pippin, the Devon Crimson Queen, the Cotehele Beauty. Some are named for their appearances: the Oaken Pin looks like a skittle when it is hanging from a bough, while the Pig's Snout needs no explaining. The latter was lost for 50 years but should now be safe forever.<br> Walk through the mother orchard and you find the Bottlestopper, the Rattler and the Cat's Head. The Pear Apple looks like a pear but tastes like an apple while Groves' favourite, the Cornish Pine, has a pleasant tropical aftertaste of pineapples. </p> <p>Lucy Cordrey, the National Trust's nature conservation technician, said the new government money - \u00a3267,000 - would be spent trying to preserve the nation's orchards and its wildlife, and map them. <br>The trust, the lead organisation in a partnership of orchard-friendly bodies, does not even know how many it has. </p> <p>It carried out a quick audit and drew up a list of 100, but feels sure it must have many more. \"Nobody knows how many orchards there are, or how many varieties. There must be hundreds, thousands across the country,\" said Cordrey.</p> <p>Orchards are home for bats, butterflies, moths and rare insects but, again, Cordrey said no full survey of the flora and fauna they give a home to had been done. </p> <p>Lovers of the orchard hope the realisation of how important they are as habitats, along with renewed interest in homegrown apples, not to mention cider, will give a new lease of life to Britain's orchards. </p> <h2>Unusual apples at Cotehele</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-339307610\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2008/11/04/varieties3.jpg\" alt=\"Apples at Cotehele orchard\" width=\"140\" height=\"84\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Netted Russet</strong><br>Good in an apple pie if it is taken straight off the tree.

  "<p>Donald Trump has been given the freedom of Scotland. Permission to build a minor new town among the sand dunes north of Aberdeen. Carte blanche to construct a clubhouse with more non-vernacular turrets and spires than Sleeping Beauty's castle. Licensed to kill the planning system that once prevented development in sensitive and protected habitats. </p> <p>Trump's \u00a31bn resort, complete with centrepiece hotel, leisure complex, shops, restaurants, 950 timeshare flats, 500 private homes, 36 villas, a golf academy and housing for 400 staff is more than a golf course \u2013 it's a billion-pound stunt worthy of 007 himself.</p> <p>In short, The Trump's been given the Full Monty. A terrible pun. But a billionaire with no shame, little sense of style, large amounts of hair and unlimited ambition has injected a strong sense of theatre and unreality into the sober business of Scottish planning.</p> <p>For more than a year, every step taken by the sharp-talking American has been followed, analysed and commented upon as if he were a reincarnation of Burt Lancaster's 's oil magnate in Local Hero.</p> <p>What will the all-conquering Trump now bestow upon the little people of Aberdeenshire? And will any of the jobs, jacuzzis, and celebrity birdies compensate for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/may/20/conservationandendangeredspecies.theobserversuknewspages\">inevitable damage to wildlife</a> and the famous shifting dunes of Balmedie?</p> <p>Just like the dunes, the argument won't sit still.</p> <p>Do golf-lovers like the plan? Not necessarily. A straw poll of Americans coming off the famous 18th hole at <a href=\"http://www.standrews.org.uk/\">St Andrews</a>found few backers. \"Too cold,\" \"No direct flights\", \"Not enough places to visit locally\" and \"Not quaint enough,\" were some of the replies. </p> <p>Bear in mind that the most expensive flat in Scotland sits not in Edinburgh's New Town but smack-bang opposite that final Old Course green. There's big money in golf. But is it old, conservative Yankee dollars, or new, adventurous golf-mad yens? The jury's out.</p> <p>Do golf-haters oppose the plan? Not necessarily. </p> <p>Golf should be the world's most democratic game. Thanks to the handicap system a poor player on a good day can \"beat\" a good player on a bad day. The fact Scots dreamed up such an equitable game should be a matter of international pride \u2013 stronger evidence of our progressive national culture than free personal care or the Tartan Army. Instead, golf in Scotland has become a by-word for snobbery, exclusion and sexism. </p> <p>If entering Trumpton is related to the possession of mere cash \u2013 not the same private parts or private-school pedigree as the club secretary \u2013 then <a href=\"http://www.marthaburk.org/cultofpower.html\">Martha Burk</a>, <a href=\"http://www.michellewie.com/ \">Michelle Wie</a> and <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/in_depth/2001/the_open/bbc_coverage/1424832.stm\">Laura Davies</a> might be able to think the unthinkable and enter the clubhouse after winning an Open. And more ordinary Scotswomen might be able to play.</p> <p>Do locals hate the disturbance? Again \u2013 there's no consensus. The fisherman who has refused to sell his home at the centre of the resort is still adamant he won't be moving. But many people in the nearest village are supporters of the scheme \u2013 oil widows tired with the barley-and-barbed wire landscape who hope the spa, swimming pools and restaurants will liven up the local scene. </p> <p>Ironically, it may not be the planning process but the credit crunch that does for Donald and his plan to build \"the greatest golf course in the world.\" Martin Ford is the councillor who lost his job as head of the planning committee when he used his casting vote to say no to Trump, triggering the SNP government's unusual decision to call the application in. </p> <p>Ford has been abandoned by fellow Lib Dem colleagues but almost deified by conservationists and a wider, sceptical Scottish public. \"Who's queuing up to buy executive homes now?\" he said. </p> <p>He's got a point.</p>",
  "<p>Twelve years ago, <a href=\"http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/antenna/dolly/\">Dolly the Sheep</a> became the first mammal to be cloned from a living cell. Yesterday, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2008/nov/04/cloning-mice-frozen-mammoths\">scientists announced another first: the birth of cloned animals from frozen cells</a>. In this case, the clones were produced from mice that had been kept in the deep freeze for up to 16 years.</p> <p>At first glance it might seem a curious, if macabre, development. But the work by Japanese researchers at the <a href=\"http://www.riken.go.jp/engn/index.html\">RIKEN research centre in Yokohama</a> is important. It opens the door, if not fully, to \"resurrecting\" extinct species that many scientists thought were gone forever.</p> <p><a href=\"http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/tech/cloning/cloningrisks/\">Cloning is among the blackest of arts</a>. Unskilled technicians have a miserable success rate and even the best achieve only a minuscule number of live births for the number of attempts they make. It can so easily go wrong.</p> <p>And that is why the Japanese research, published in <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/\">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a>, is so interesting. Most scientists thought that cloning would not work with frozen cells, because as ice crystals grow in the cells, they rupture cell walls and generally damage the delicate structures inside. </p> <p>What Sayaka Wakayama and colleagues have showed is that even when cells have been damaged by ice crystals, it is sometimes possible to find intact nuclei - which contain the cell's DNA - which can be used to create healthy clones. The nucleus is simply transferred to an empty mouse egg to fertilise it.</p> <p>The Japanese team created four clones. One died of breathing difficulties shortly after birth, another was cannibalised by its foster mother. The other two grew to adulthood and are seemingly healthy.</p> <p>So how could the technique be used? Some of the <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1082776/Cloning-grave-Scientists-create-new-life-mouse-frozen-16-YEARS.html\">more fanciful media reports</a> suggest it will usher in an age when it is commonplace for people to have their brains plunged into a deep freeze upon death in the hope that someone might want to clone them later on. That would be a very odd thing. The clone would of course look very similar, and might even have some familiar behavioural traits, but in every other sense it would be just another human being, shaped by a different environment and experiences. We will probably have enough people in the future to rule out any deep desire to bring back anyone who hoped to live on in the deep freeze.</p> <p>But this research might be relevant to humans in other ways. Perhaps cells from major organs could be frozen while we're still young and cloned in old age to make healthy tissues to replace damaged or diseased parts. </p> <p>In the medium term, though, the research will mostly excite scientists who are trying to bring species back from extinction. <a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/blog/shortsharpscience/2007/07/baby-mammoth-discovery.html\">Remains of woolly mammoths</a> have been uncovered in the Russian permafrost and these may contain intact cells that could be used to create a clone. Perhaps the sabre-toothed tiger could also be resurrected? </p> <p>Serious hurdles remain, however. To create a cloned embryo you need a surrogate egg for the DNA and then a surrogate mother to carry it to term, but where do you find a female if a species is extinct? One option with the mammoth may be to create a hybrid by injecting the mammoth DNA into an elephant egg. Whether the embryo would survive until birth is a question scientists are keen to answer.</p> <p>Despite the difficulties ahead, there is reason to be hopeful. The Japanese scientists have already overcome one major hurdle, giving fresh impetus to others in the field. With effort, scientists could use this controversial technology to change the face of life on Earth.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Wednesday November 5 2008. We said the clones were produced from mice that had been frozen for 16 months, rather than 16 years. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>Tehran taxi drivers might not know where the US embassy used to be, especially if they weren't around when the Islamic Revolution took place in 1979. But ask for the \"nest of spies\" and they will head as fast as the permanently gridlocked traffic allows to Taleghani Avenue, where slogans and murals on a long brick wall proclaim a historic victory over \"global arrogance\".</p> <p>Americans remember the compound as the scene where their diplomats were held hostage for 444 days until finally being freed in January 1981 as a gesture to Ronald Reagan, the incoming Republican president. </p> <p>Reagan's predecessor, Jimmy Carter - the Democrat who had urged Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to make concessions to the opposition - ended his term with another stinging humiliation from the man who removed Pahlavi from the Peacock Throne, Ayatollah Khomeini.</p> <p>It was a coincidence that this year's anniversary of the storming of the embassy yesterday fell so close to the American presidential election, providing a vivid and timely reminder of the tortured relationship between the US and Iran .</p> <p>The speeches to mark the anniversary from the podium outside what was once called Roosevelt gate were predictably fiery. Familiar slogans - \"Death to America\" \"Death to Israel\" and \"Death to Zionism\" - were chanted in Farsi, Arabic and finally English to ensure maximum impact. Young Basij volunteers in camouflage gear and green Imam Hussein headbands sang sweetly of sacrifice and martyrdom. War veterans in wheelchairs were given place of honour on carpets rolled out in the street.</p> <p>Iranians say that the turnout at such set-piece official events is in decline and only kept up by bussing in soldiers, militiamen and children who are given the day off school to carry placards, wave banners, and burn the odd flag. The embassy rally has the ritualistic, symbolic quality of something that is done because it has been done for years, not because it means that much any more.</p> <p>Massoud, a 15-year-old Tehran schoolboy, posed happily with a \"Death to the USA\" poster, oblivious to the irony of his Colorado Rockies sweatshirt, jeans and trainers. \"I hate the US government, not the people,\" he explained. \"And especially not those who love justice and don't want to dominate the world.\"</p> <p>Only the teenage girls, some in black chadors though many with headscarves draped loosely over carefully-arranged hair, looked any different from their American counterparts.</p> <p>\"If the US embassy re-opened and started issuing visas to Iranians again, a lot of these people would be queuing up to get one,\" quipped Hussein, a teacher and trenchant critic of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. </p> <p>\"Many of my friends are thinking of leaving the country if they can because they are so unhappy with the way the government is running things.\"</p> <p>Officially, there is little interest here in the outcome of the US election. Ayatollah Khamenei, the supreme leader, has spoken of \"deep-seated differences\" between the two countries, apparently seeking to squash speculation about any sudden change, or at least ensuring that he will control it if there is. </p> <p>\"Obama and McCain have differences over tactics, not strategy,\" argued Hamidreza Taraghi of the Islamic Coalition party, an Ahmadinejad ally. \"Anyway they are both sponsored by the Zionists so we can't expect they won't be influenced by them.\"</p> <p>Jamal, a middle-aged driver, wanted to see John McCain in the White House because \"he will attack Iran and set us free\". Yet he also wants Iran to develop nuclear weapons (the government insists, to widespread scepticism abroad, that its only motive in developing nuclear technology is to generate power). \"We are threatened by the US and Israel. If the Jews have the atomic bomb, why shouldn't we?\"</p> <p>Voices in the reformist camp are more nuanced about the prospects of an Obama win. Hossein Adeli, head of the Ravand Foundation, the country's only non-official NGO, predicts that positive gestures from Washington will be met by greater Iranian cooperation over Iraq and Afghanistan. \"If Obama wants to change the image of America in the world Iran is one area were he can demonstrate it,\" he said. \"It would give him the edge over his predecessors.\"</p> <p>With so much at stake it is natural that the world is focused on the drama of the race for the White House. But, the Iranian reformists suggest, it may be that their own presidential election next June will prove almost as crucial. </p> <p>Ahmadinejad's rhetoric about Israel and the Holocaust - the latter at least an embarrassment to many here - will likely be a serious barrier to any rapprochement. But if Obama makes it to the Oval Office he could expect to find an easier interlocutor in Mohamed Khatemi, the former president who oversaw a partial thaw in US-Iranian relations until George Bush's \"axis of evil\" speech and the subsequent focus on Iran's nuclear ambitions. Reformists hope Khatemi will stand again, pointing to reliable polling that shows his popularity ratings more than double those of Ahmadinejad.</p> <p>But it is highly uncertain whether he will stand, and unlikely that he or any other reformist could actually win.</p> <p>\"For Iranians, the election in the US is not important,\" said Mohammed Ali Abtahi, a cleric and former vice-president under Khatemi. \"What is important is what happens here.\"</p> <p>Farnaz, a 22-year-old animator, was born years after the drama of Tehran's \"nest of spies\" and barely glances at the angry slogans on Taleghani Avenue. Farnaz prefers Obama to McCain or Bush.

If convicted, they could be sent to prison for 10 years.</p> <p>\"Our actions have taken the plight of the whales to the top of the political agenda,\" Jun Hoshikawa, Greenpeace Japan's executive director, said in a statement. \"But if we are to bring this hunt to an end, we have to bring change in Tokyo.\"</p> <p>Greenpeace denied it had bowed to pressure from the Japanese authorities. \"The key country we need to influence is Japan, and we want to do that inside Japan,\" Greenpeace spokesman Dave Walsh told the Guardian. \"We do have an international impact, but there's not a lot of point in preaching to the converted.</p> <p>\"We have saved whales every year we've been in the Antarctic, but we want to end whaling for good and we can't do that if all our resources and energy are focused on the Southern Ocean.\"</p> <p>However, the whaling fleet, which is due to leave for the Southern Ocean later this month, will not be able to carry out its cull unhampered.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/18/japan\">Sea Shepherd, a marine conservation group that advocates direct action</a>, has vowed to disrupt the fleet's attempts to slaughter whales as part of Japan's controversial scientific whaling programme.</p> <p>\"We intend to be more aggressive and even more relentless,\" Peter Hammarstedt, a Sea Shepherd activist, said in a statement. \"We intend to make sure no whales are caught on our watch.\"</p> <p>Last year Japan's whalers had planned to catch 850 minke whales but returned this spring with 551 after being frustrated by Greenpeace and Sea Shepherd activists.</p> <p>Although commercial whaling was banned in 1986, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/26/whaling.conservation\">Japan is permitted to catch whales for \"lethal research\" into the mammals' migratory and other habits</a> in anticipation of a return to sustainable commercial culls.</p> <p>Sato and Suzuki were arrested in June after intercepting 23kg of whale meat they claimed had been pilfered by crew from the factory ship the Nisshin Maru and sold on Japan's lucrative black market. They will go on trial early next year.</p> <p>\"Junichi and Toru's trial is politically motivated,\" said Sara Holden, Greenpeace's whale campaign coordinator. \"If the Japanese government wants to make political prisoners out of people who oppose whaling, then they are going to have to take a lot more prisoners.\"</p> <p>The group said 250,000 people had emailed the Japanese prime minister, Taro Aso, demanding that the charges be dropped.</p>",

  "<p>As the campaign season wraps up and November 4 inches closer, one cannot help but reflect on what an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._presidential_election,_2008_timeline\">extraordinary election season</a> this has been. </p> <p>Who could have known a year ago that Barack Obama would beat Hillary Clinton to become the Democratic nominee? That a hitherto unknown governor of Alaska \u2013 a state with a population smaller than Columbus, Ohio \u2013 would become the Republican vice presidential nominee and subsequently an international phenomenon? That Obama would raise over $600m, the majority of which has come from small donations made by regular Americans? Or that a global economic downturn would rear its head and the government would agree to a $700m bail-out plan? </p> <p>If <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1855843,00.html\">John McCain loses on Tuesday</a>, I'm sure he will kick himself as he looks back at the twists and turns that his campaign has taken. Members of his own party as well as Republican strategists and analysts have already concurred that McCain's campaign for the presidency has lacked an overarching theme or message. It started off well, but has lurched from pillar to post with its weaknesses and inconsistencies. </p> <p>Whereas McCain was once considered the more solid and experienced candidate, the shocking pick of Sarah Palin for vice-president and his response to the economic crisis \u2013 matters that a seasoned politician like McCain should have been able to handle with ease \u2013 have been his undoing, now revealing a man who appears to lack integrity and good judgment, which is in sharp contrast to how he was once perceived.</p> <p>It's fair to say that both Obama and his chances of succeeding were underestimated when he entered the race for the White House. A year ago Obama's talk of \"change\" and \"hope\" were criticised for being nothing more than lofty rhetoric with little practical significance. Writing in The New Republic in October 2007, political commentator Noam Scheiber <a href=\"http://blogs.tnr.com/tnr/blogs/the_stump/archive/2007/10/29/more-advice-for-obama.aspx\">advised</a>: \"I think Obama's changing politics theme is too ambitious.\" He then went on to say: \"Where Obama goes wrong is his choice of general-election themes. I think the 2004 approach \u2013 making the case against Bush-style Republicanism \u2013 is much better suited to the current moment than the hopeful, new-politics theme.\" As we now know, Scheiber and others who thought that way were wrong. The messages of change and hope have galvanised and enthused millions of Americans in a way that has been entirely unprecedented. Very few can fail to be impressed by the highly effective, consistent, extremely organised and impressive campaign that Obama has run in this election. </p> <p>Obama has managed to turn issues \u2013 such as race \u2013 that others believed would be his downfall into his triumph. The Jeremiah Wright controversy, for example, threatened to derail his campaign, with a <a href=\"http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/people2/just_8_have_favorable_opinion_of_pastor_jeremiah_wright\">March Rasmussen poll</a> saying that 56% of voters were less likely to vote for Obama because of Wright's comments. However, Obama used Reverend Wright's comments to his advantage: they allowed him to give one of the most important speeches on race relations that America has heard for a long time, raising his popularity again. It has continued to grow since. </p> <p>Before the primaries, many African Americans believed that white Americans wouldn't vote for Obama. In December 2007, Eugene Robinson of the Washington Post <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/10/AR2007121001563.html\">wrote</a>: \"[Senior black politicians and figures] have griped privately to me that this whole Obama thing is madness, that he can't possibly win and that with a known quantity such as Hillary Clinton in the race, this is no time to go chasing rainbows.\" With Obama currently poised to become America's first African American president, those people must be eating their words today. </p> <p>A January 2007 Time magazine article entitled <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1581666,00.html\">Can Obama Count On The Black Vote?</a> highlighted a lack of support for Obama among black leaders and quoted Reverend Al Sharpton as saying: \"Right now, we're hearing a lot of media razzle-dazzle \u2026 I'm not hearing a lot of meat, or a lot of content.\" This past Saturday night, the same Al Sharpton appeared on CNN <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/bestoftv/2008/11/02/dl.al.sharpton.cnn\">singing Obama's praises</a>. </p> <p>Similarly, prominent black figures and politicians \u2013 and even regular African Americans \u2013 who were originally sceptical of Obama have since done a dramatic about-turn. African American turn out on Tuesday is set to break records and is expected to have a major influence on key states such as North Carolina and Virginia.</p> <p>There have been a number of surprising events during the campaign. The Democratic party did not implode when Hillary lost to Obama in the primary. The Hillary supporters who were supposed to have flocked to McCain in droves soon turned back to Obama, especially after the appearance of Sarah Palin \u2013 who has risen from a virtual nobody to being one of the most famous women in the world and who is expected to run for president in 2012. Last week Bill Clinton and Obama <a href=\"http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_world/view/386489/1/.html\">went on the campaign trail together</a>, and the party appears more unified than before. </p> <p>Once considered naive and inexperienced, Obama has emerged \u2013 strengthened by his performance during the debates and his response to the economic crisis \u2013 as the most presidential and statesman-like candidate, and he certainly is <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/03/us/politics/03caucus.html?hp\">not trailing</a> among white working-class voters as anticipated. </p> <p>Not even the most astute of political analysts could have foreseen the events that have taken place during this presidential campaign. No matter who wins on Tuesday, this has been a momentous period. </p> <p>I started following this campaign soap-opera in earnest on September 27, 2007 when I saw Obama speak at a rally in New York. It's been a riveting journey since then. No doubt there are many lessons for politicians and strategists to learn from this campaign. The most important? Never underestimate the audacity of hope.</p>",
  "<p>Cartoonists and photo librarians are already printing their farewell selections on George W Bush, and the Guardian's G2 has been giving him one last bashing or three \u2013 though the famous US presidential transition means Dubya still has three months to serve.</p> <p>But how bad a president has he been in the larger scheme of things? Who was the worst and indeed the best of the 43 elected since that remarkable constitution (unlike the EU's wordy jargon, it can be both read and understood in 20 minutes) was painstakingly constructed at Philadelphia in 1787? </p> <p>My views of the No 1 are pretty conventional, I'm afraid. I'm an Abraham Lincoln (1861-65) man, though George Washington (1789-97), wise and unflashy founding president of the republic, commands a good case. Eight years is enough for anyone, he realised, an enduring precedent, which even Vladimir Putin had to respect (sort of).</p> <p>Up there too is the man who breached it in exceptional circumstances: Franklin D Roosevelt (1933-45). He never gets enough credit, says me, for being the greatest political figure of the 20th century, the leader who mastered both the depression and global war against fearsome enemies without resort to tyranny or barbarism.</p> <p>But we can all play this game. As with sporting heroes, great movies and much else there are people who devote huge amounts of time to \"best of'' lists, as any Google search confirms. What I call <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_rankings_of_United_States_Presidents \">Wikipedia University</a> confirms that my trio usually takes the top three places, with Thomas Jefferson and Theodore Roosevelt \u2013 he wouldn't have cut those Wall St bankers so much slack \u2013 just behind them. That's cool with me too.</p> <p><a href=\" http://www.karemar.com/blog/top-10-united-states-presidents-all-time \">Here's another</a> I found easily, one which includes useful summaries of achievement and stirring quotes. JFK (1961-63) doesn't make the top 10, nor should he, but the compiler includes him as a \"personal favourite\". That's nice, but it's also a warning that \u2013 as with movies where recent duds often outshine enduring classics \u2013 we can all be misled by our own perspective.</p> <p>The Times \u2013 London, not New York - <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/us_elections/article5055404.ece\">took a crack at this one the other day</a>. A panel of Times pundits ranked all 42 (not 43 because Grover Cleveland got elected for two separate terms) with what I thought were some perverse results, especially in the back half.</p> <p>As Times posters were quick to protest, you can't put Richard Nixon (1969-74) at No 37. Yes, he was a seriously flawed man, paranoid and vengeful (a US chum says McCain would be the same), and driven from office for shocking misconduct, the only such president.</p> <p>But he was also a brilliant man who drew isolated China back into the international sphere and ended the Vietnam war. That had been messed up by Lyndon Johnson (1963-69) who makes the cut at No 12 for his domestic achievements, anti-poverty programmes, but above all the civil rights legislation, which has allowed Barack Obama to be where he is today. </p> <p>In doing so Johnson, the supreme political manipulator, admitted that the Democrats would \"lose the south for a generation\". True, though they may be about to get them back. But Johnson too was a flawed political genius for whom Bill Shakespeare would have got out his Olivetti, as he would for Nixon but few others among the 41-plus-Grover-and Grover. Most were fairly unremarkable men upon whom varying degrees of greatness were thrust.</p> <p>That's why Harry Truman (1945-53) usually comes out well. No one expected much of FDR's deputy, but he rose to the challenges he inherited. Yes, I know he dropped the atom bomb of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. Did it save many Japanese as well as American lives? I have always felt so, but others disagree.</p> <p>What about the bad guys? The Times puts James Buchanan (1857-61), the Democrat who dithered and drifted towards the bloody civil war that nearly destroyed the union, as No 42, a verdict echoed by other even weightier surveys. Franklin Pierce, his predecessor (1853-57), a drunk and incompetent, was placed second worst.</p> <p>Myself, I think Rutherford Hayes (1877-81), a Republican elected after a \"hanging chads\" kind of scandal in Florida, has a lot to answer for. As part of the deal which let him win the disputed election he pulled federal troops out of the occupied south and allowed racist Jim Crow laws to be re-established for the next 80 years.</p> <p>So does Warren Harding (1921-23) who presided over a post-war boom, marred by red-baiting attacks on civil liberties and spectacular corruption. </p> <p>Ulysses S Grant (1869-77) also tolerated the \"robber baron\" era and a depression. Being a great war-winning general was not enough, though another such, Dwight Eisenhower (1953-61), comes out better: a decent man who hated war and warned against the emergence of an over-powerful military-industrial complex. </p> <p>Under a weak president like Dubya it has become one of the greatest threats to American liberties \u2013 and by extension to our own. So how is George W Bush likely to fare at the hands of history?</p> <p>As with Ronald Reagan (No 8 in the Times list) and Bill Clinton (slapped down to No 23) it's all too soon to be clear. Reagan was very likeable, and his supporters claim he \"won\" the cold war against the USSR, which first crumbled on his watch. How significant was that? We don't yet know.</p> <p>Clinton, a man of great potential, was a disappointment. Yet he presided over a successful economy, unencumbered by the huge public debt, which both Bushes helped create. The Lewinsky affair was deplorable, but some of his tormentors in Congress were exposed for hypocrisy on a far bigger scale.</p> <p>George W Bush has particular problems. History's verdict on his Iraq war depends on how the Middle East evolves over the next 20 years and beyond. If more stable and successful states emerge, their citizens healthier, wealthier and happier, then the Bushites may claim some credit. </p> <p>And vice-versa. As for the post 9/11 \"war on terror\" it was misconceived and overblown. Domestic civil liberties suffered \u2013 most conspicuously at Guant\u00e1namo Bay \u2013 taking America's \"soft power\" reputation down around the world. The courts will one day declare the policy to have been unconstitutional.</p> <p>It's Bush's domestic economic record which may push him close to the bottom of the league \u2013 where many Americans already put him, albeit prematurely. He was dominated by highly ideological officials who slashed the wrong taxes for the wrong people (rich ones), allowed a budget surplus to become a huge deficit and spent like drunken sailors. </p> <p>Worse, an unsustainable boom turned into the past year's dramatic bust. Rightwing free market theorists have been forced to nationalise banks. If that all wasn't enough there was the shameful neglect of Hurricane Katrina: another avoidable bust which destroyed much of the great American city that was New Orleans.</p> <p>So President Obama or President McCain \u2013 my caution persists until the votes are all counted - will inherit a heavy burden, with expectations on the frontrunner recklessly high. George W has been hidden throughout much of the campaign. You could almost feel sorry for him.</p> <p>But hey's this is America. So let's end as Americans try to do, on an optimistic note. Lincoln was the country's greatest president because he was a leader who combined low political cunning, the ability to master men and events, with heady rhetoric and a moral vision expressed in simple, stirring English, the language of the King James Bible, Shakespeare and the founding fathers. He saved the union \u2013 what he called 'the last, best hope of mankind\".</p> <p>If you haven't read Lincoln's <a href=\"http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/gettysburg.htm\">Gettysburg Address lately, here it is</a>, delivered in 1863 on the site of a bloody, recent battlefield where the confederacy's last attempt to split the union north of Washington. Just 272 words, mocked (by the London Times!) as inadequate at the time, it's what we'd now call a pretty good Victorian soundbite. </p> <p>I like to think that Honest Abe, up there on his cloud, will be watching the count tonight, along with the countless million ghosts of the Atlantic slave trade. Who'd have thought it, eh?</p>",

  "<p>Much has been written on the cultural value of James Bond. One of the best accounts described him as \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2006/jun/18/film\">the man who saved Britain</a>\", a cultural icon whose bravado and single-handed ability allowed the British to accept their post-world-war-two loss of empire. Indeed, Britain didn't need a massive Royal Navy or colonial dominions when they had Bond to save the day with \"logistical support\" from the willing and powerful, but na\u00efve, Americans.</p> <p>Fleming's Bond was the ideal weapon for the cold war, a cost-effective scalpel that contrasted with the hammer of prospective nuclear Armageddon. Bond was every inch the super-Brit with tailor-made suits, British ingenuity in gadget form, an ability to parley in multiple languages and the suaveness to conquer the women of the world with little difficulty. </p> <p>This Bond was always going to be challenged by rapidly changing times and values. Indeed before the release of The Bourne Supremacy, Matt Damon emphasised <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19934693/\">the difference between Jason Bourne and James Bond</a> by claiming that \"the Bond character will always be anchored in the 1960s and the values of the 60s ... Bond is an imperialist and a misogynist who kills people and laughs about it and drinks martinis and cracks jokes.\" </p> <p>Bourne by contrast would represent to many liberal Americans the perfect incarnation of what US foreign policy should be. A man with a conscience whose mission in life is to work out who he is whilst trying to apologise to all those he hurt when he was a tool of the government. Bourne's enemy is the corrupted and unaccountable government agencies who assassinate Guardian journalists at Waterloo station and replace unfriendly with friendly African dictators. </p> <p>Bourne is instinctively anti-government whereas Bond has loyally given his life in the service of Queen and country. Indeed in the past to support Bond was to support the British government, with its old oak-panelled offices and M's calm order in the face of impending chaos and conspiracy. Much has changed since Fleming's day, and the Iraq war discredited both British intelligence as well as blowing a hole through the ideals of an ethical British foreign policy. The inability to reconcile the original Bond with the world order of today has been blown open in the latest film that has already <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7705631.stm\">broken British box office records</a>. </p> <p>The critical factor in this is that Bond, presumably in his bid to be more like Bourne, has paradoxically started operating off the grid and beyond the orders of his government. Some would argue that he has \"gone rogue\" in the past \u2013 but this time he has explicitly defied British government policy of \"talking with bad guys\" (see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/02/saudiarabia-creditcrunch\">Gordon Brown in Saudi Arabia</a>) in the face of very real resource exploitation wars involving the US and China. </p> <p>Simply put Bond finds it impossible to operate in a world whose complexities lie well beyond the good/evil, with us/against us logic of President Bush et al. This impossibility is reflected in a fragmented narrative. The Sunday Times <a href=\"http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/film_reviews/article5001623.ece \">review of the film</a> went so far as arguing that the villains of the new film would just as likely to be found working in the World Bank as the secretive Quantum of Solace. The review goes on to state that Bond \"no longer represents anything particularly British, or even modern. In place of glamour, we get a spurious grit; instead of style, we get product placement; in place of fantasy, we get a redundant and silly realism. Craig makes an attractive corpse, but Bond is dead.\" </p> <p>The ability to kill everyone in sight and disobey the orders of elected officials pursuing realist agendas is totally out of place in the multi-polar and highly unstable foreign policy environment of today. Daniel Craig said in an interview that one of the main ideas of the film was for \"Bond to understand\" what is going on around him. The reality is that despite continued high British public expectations of Bond, there may be no place for any realist version of Fleming's cold war spy in the world of today.</p>",
  "<p>Londoners will be encouraged to turn flat roofs into vegetable plots as part of a scheme to grow food on 2012 patches of land across the capital by 2012, Boris Johnson said today. </p> <p>The \"<a href=\"http://www.capitalgrowth.org\">Capital Growth</a>\" project is the first initiative delivered by Rosie Boycott since she was appointed chair of London Food by the London mayor over the summer. </p> <p>The former newspaper editor wants councils, schools, hospitals, housing estates, and utility companies to identify derelict land that can be turned into vegetable gardens by green-fingered Londoners keen to grow their own spuds rather than buy transported produce from the supermarket.</p> <p>Boycott also envisages that spare pieces of land can be found on canal banks, banks of reservoirs, and disused railway yards.</p> <p>Boycott said: \"London has a good deal of green spaces \u2013 some derelict or underused - but not being used as well as they could be. We also have a veritable host of enthusiastic gardeners who are well equipped to turning derelict or underused spaces into thriving oases offering healthy food and a fantastic focus for the community. </p> <p>\"Capital Growth will identify spaces across the capital \u2013 often in surprising places such as roof gardens \u2013 and help London's communities grow their own food.\"</p> <p>Boycott said in an interview in yesterday's Times that it was hoped that the 2012 makeshift plots could be found in time for the Olympics so that some of the homegrown food could be provided to athletes.</p> <p>The demand for allotments has rocketed over recent years as environmental awareness has increased.</p> <p>But a survey conducted by the London assembly two years ago found Londoners in some parts of the capital were waiting up to 10 years for an allotment, due to a dramatic decline in the number of available plots caused by owners wanting to put the land to other uses. </p> <p>The London mayor wants to turn back the tide to promote locally grown food in the face of rising food prices and the challenge to protect the environment.</p> <p>Londoners will receive both financial and practical support to grow their own, such as gardening tools and compost.</p> <p>Launching the project at a vegetable and herb garden run by a charity for disabled people in Battersea Park, Johnson said: \"Linking up currently unloved patches of land with people who want to discover the wonders of growing their own food, delivers massive benefits. It will help to make London a greener, more pleasant place to live while providing healthy and affordable food. </p> <p>\"This will aid people to reconnect with where their fruit and veg comes from and cut the congestion and carbon emissions associated with the transportation of food from miles away. Capital Growth is a win-win scheme - good for our communities and good for our environment.\"</p> <p>Capital Growth will be run by London Food Link, part of the charity Sustain, which is working for better food and farming to enhance people's health and welfare and the environment. </p> <p>The London Development Agency will fund a pilot scheme over the next six months to identify the first 50 spaces, at a cost of \u00a387,000.</p>",

  "<p>Labour has put up a good fight in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/glenrothes\">Glenrothes</a>, but I don't think they've done enough yet. They've hit the nationalists hard on the economy and council cuts. But the problem with Labour's campaign, as with Glasgow East, is the sheer lack of bodies on the ground. No regal visits from Gordon Brown and <a href=\" http://www.theherald.co.uk/politics/news/display.var.2465128.0.Sarah_Brown_spends_another_weekend_knocking_on_doors.php \">the first lady, Sarah</a>, can make up for activists knocking on doors. At the weekend, the nationalists piled 1,200 volunteers onto the streets and put leaflets through every one of the 40,000 homes in the constituency. You just can't answer that kind of effort. </p> <p>The SNP have been working this constituency for over a year. They won the overlapping Scottish Parliamentary seat in 2007 and they lead the council coalition. They know where their voters are, and they know where their possible voters are, and they are targeting them relentlessly. People cannot help but respond to this kind of engagement, which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/26/glenrothes-byelection-scotland-gordon-brown\">Labour is unable to match</a> because its grassroots have withered over the years of New Labour disillusion. It is ironic that Labour is relying on the old communist-voting enclaves of this constituency, for it has been Gordon Brown's abandonment of social democracy, not support for nationalism, that has led to safe seats like this falling to the SNP. Labour turned its back years ago, and they haven't forgotten. </p> <p>Oh yes, Gordon has saved the world \u2013 at least according to the Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman \u2013 and Glenrothes is duly grateful. Though they might be a little more grateful if they could afford their heating bills. The many commuters in this constituency feel pressured by fuel costs and insecurity at work. Families on middle incomes can't afford a house even as prices are falling. The only relief they've had in the past couple of years has been the SNP government freezing council tax, abolishing tolls on the Forth bridge to Edinburgh, and introducing cuts in prescription charges. </p> <p>Labour has fought back, pointing to increases in elderly care costs imposed by the nationalist-led local council. It says the SNP's local income tax \u2013 the \"<a href=\"http://www.snp.org/node/13694\">Nat Tax</a>\" \u2013 will hit working families. Labour accuses the SNP of being latter day Thatcherites \u2013 tartan Tories who will ransack services to funnel cash to small businesses through rates relief. But it's too soon for Labour to start presenting themselves again as champions of the dispossessed. People here see the \u00a3500bn being handed to the City of London and wonder when they are going to get a bit of a bailout. The memory of the 10p tax band lingers. Labour is seen by many of its former voters as the party of the London plutocracy - an image reinforced during the campaign by Peter Mandelson's antics in Corfu with Russian oligarchs. </p> <p>Yes, the SNP leader Alex Salmond has taken a battering in the financial crisis. His vainglorious declarations about saving HBOS and RBS made him look slightly daft. His arc of prosperity \u2013 formerly-prosperous Nordic nations like Iceland \u2013 has turned into the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/20/snp-scotland-salmond-labour-brown\">arc of insolvency</a>. The idea of formal independence for Scotland seems even more of an anachronism than ever. If this election was about Scottish separatism, the nationalists would be nowhere. </p> <p>But Glenrothes is not a referendum on independence. It is about which party seems more willing and able to represent the people in this corner of Fife which is prosperous by many standards but feels just a little hard done by. The SNP is a populist party which really, really wants their votes, and it will get a lot of them. Both the nationalists' and Labour's canvass returns suggest the SNP is in the lead by a couple of thousand votes. Events may change that on the home straight, and in the midst of the greatest global financial crisis in eighty years, people may in the end vote for the devil they know in a seat that has been Labour since time began. But as I say - I just don't think Labour have done enough.</p>",
  "<p>All too often the global fixture calendar resembles something drawn up by a descendant of the Marquis de Sade. November is the cruellest month of all, as Martin Johnson will soon discover as he elbows his way back out of the comfort zone and on to the treadmill of international rugby affairs. England are due to face the full metal jacket of Australia, South Africa and New Zealand on successive Saturdays, preceded by a tenderising 80 minutes against the Pacific Islands. There will be no mercy at any stage.</p> <p>It is arguably even worse for New Zealand, whose end-of-season odyssey takes in Hong Kong, Edinburgh, Dublin, Limerick, Cardiff and London. The midweek date against Munster in Thomond Park represents a rude awakening in itself, never mind the actual Test matches. Australia have just limped into northern Italy via the Far East, Heathrow and Luton airports. Arriving into a European winter from the humidity of Asia can disorientate even the most frequent fliers.</p> <p>For once, though, the inter-hemisphere playing field appears flatter than for some time. The All Blacks may be looking a shade leg-weary in certain positions but they have had a useful warm-up lap as a prelude to their grand slam circuit of the four home unions. England's management, conversely, have enjoyed more training time with their players than any of their predecessors under the new eight-year agreement between the Rugby Football Union and the clubs. All sides, too, are now on nodding terms, for better or worse, with the latest experimental laws and breakdown-related edicts. There are no excuses left, other than the 'world's-against-me' wail of every touring side since the dawn of time.</p> <p>And this time, too, every single nation has a common autumnal purpose. This is the final raft of games before the pool draw for the 2011 World Cup is made next month, with a top-four seeding the ideal goal. Currently England sit fifth in the IRB world rankings, just behind Argentina. If the Pumas lose away to France, Italy and Ireland, England's job will be pretty much done by default as defeats to sides ranked above them (New Zealand, South Africa, Australia, in that order) are treated more forgivingly by a complex statistical matrix which makes the Duckworth-Lewis method seem positively basic.</p> <p>Johnson is largely ignoring the headache-inducing maths, taking the pragmatic view that if his side win games they will be in business, and vice versa. \"Does it make a New Zealand v England game more important?\" he asks rhetorically. Fair enough, but the central issue of whether his rewired team is capable of lighting up Twickenham will be answered soon enough. The Pacific Islands, at the very least, will tell us a fair amount about Riki Flutey's defensive qualities and it is only necessary to think back to last autumn's World Cup to be aware of the talent of, among others, the Tongan captain Nili Latu and his European-based Fijian and Samoan comrades in the backs. Vilimoni Delasau, Kameli Ratuvou, Seilala Mapusua and Sailosi Tagicakibau are all seriously dangerous players capable of denting reputations of all sizes.</p> <p>Matt Giteau's sweet offload for the Wallabies' first try in Hong Kong, the pace of Bryan Habana, the directness of Ma'a Nonu and the string-pulling of Dan Carter will also be concentrating English minds. For all their desire to play a more dynamic all-court game, their chances of Johnson's men achieving anything more than a 50-50 record over their four games depend on their forwards tightening the screw first. The perfect scenario would involve blowing the Islanders and the Wallabies aside in the set-pieces and, in the process, generating the quick ball upon which the incoming Brian Smith's attacking desires can be sated. Win the first two games and, suddenly, a vibrant reversal of last year's World Cup final result against the Springboks becomes a possibility.</p> <p>Johnson, it should be noted, does not have a track record of gallant defeat in professional sport but even he would probably settle at this early stage, if offered, for two victories and a couple of tight losses. There is also a sense that a number of Wales's players have yet to come fully to the boil this season; the chances of them strolling through the autumn unbeaten must be remote. If anyone is equipped to beat the All Blacks before England have a crack at them it is surely Ireland. The new coach, Declan Kidney, is no stranger to his players and Croke Park will make Hong Kong Stadium feel like home from home for the Kiwis. My hunch is that none of the touring sides will fly home unbeaten and that England will have sneaked back into the top four of the world rankings by early December.</p> <h2>ABIDING IMAGE</h2> <p>Sport offered some salutory lessons over the weekend, most of them a variation on the theme of not counting your chickens prematurely. Ferrari's pit-lane personnel, to be fair, were less culpable than England's cricketers who clearly thought they merely had to show up in the Caribbean to collect the Stanford loot. My abiding image of the weekend, though, occurred during England's rugby league drubbing at the hands of Australia. It reminded me a lot of England's union debacle against South Africa at last year's 15-a-side World Cup so, perhaps, all is not totally lost. But did you see Greg Inglis, the Kangaroo centre? I've been trying to think of a current union centre who possesses more power and alertness. It's proving mighty difficult.</p> <h2>SKY IN BOX SEAT</h2> <p>Sky have secured a new five-year deal to show all England's matches outside the Six Nations and World Cup. This is clearly good news for anyone with a satellite dish because the Sky boys and girls do a thoroughly good, professional job. Personally I'd put Stuart Barnes on Newsnight as well. The inside whisper, however, is that Sky also want to bid for the 2011 Rugby World Cup. Good luck to them, and all that, but with the profile of the EDF Energy Cup about to be reduced it does not leave a great deal for the poor old terrestrials, give or take the news that live games will be simulcast on Sky Player, the broadcaster's online TV service. The Rugby Football Union is currently trying to reduce the numbers of young people who give up rugby between the ages of 16 and 24. It is not easy to woo kids back to a sport which they will struggle to watch on television unless they have wealthy parents.</p>",
  "<p>Most people will be too carried away by the relentless action in the latest Bond film to notice the background, but design-minded viewers will find it more exciting than most. It's unlikely to go down as the best Bond ever, but <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/122628/quantum.of.solace\">Quantum of Solace</a> wins hands down when it comes to best architecture. </p> <p>Perhaps it's because he's Swiss, but director Marc Forster certainly has an eye for a good building, usually a piece of hard-edged European modernism with a conveniently flat roof. A key location, for example, is the <a href=\"http://www.truevenue.com/en/locations/detail.php?id=973\"> Festival House Bregenz</a>, in Austria - a dauntingly sophisticated ensemble of steel cladding and huge glass windows that opens out on to a spectacular open-air amphitheatre facing the lake, with the stage in the middle of the water. Designed by Austrian architect <a href=\"http://www.dietrich.untertrifaller.com/project.php?id=161&amp;type=KULTUR&amp;lang=en\"> Dietrich Untertrifaller</a>, it's the perfect venue for a covert mid-opera meeting of arch-villains. It's also great for crane shots, tuxedo-clad shootouts, and the odd rooftop punch-up. Forster seems to have passed up on another local landmark, mind you: the <a href=\"http://www.kunsthaus-bregenz.at\"> Kunsthaus Bregenz</a>, designed by his revered compatriot Peter Zumthor. Perhaps it just didn't have enough places to plug in a Klieg light. </p> <p>Elsewhere we get a precarious chase over the terracotta tiled roofscape of Siena, a brief tour of London's Barbican, some grand colonial buildings in Panama, even a car chase through Italy's Carrara marble quarry - birthplace of Rome's Pantheon, among others. Topping the bill, though, is the <a href=\"http://www.eso.org/public/outreach/bond/Residencia.html\"> ESO Paranal Residencia</a> in Chile, where the traditional climactic rendezvous between Bond and his nemesis takes place. In reality, this stunning building is a hostel for astronomers at the European Organisation for Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere. Designed by German architects Auer and Weber it's a fine choice: a long rectangular strip of a building, sunk into the barren landscape that contains a splendid indoor garden and swimming pool lit by a 35-metre glass dome. Being situated in the middle of the Atacama desert, 2,400 metres above sea level, it's a place very few of us are likely to ever see inside for real, so here's your chance. Be dazzled by the rhythmic concrete facades! Thrill to the earth-toned interiors! Swoon over the long internal perspectives. Salivate over the minimal detailing! Then watch it all get blown to smithereens!</p> <p>Yes, almost inevitably, the building does not survive its encounter with Bond, and as he saunters away from its smoking ruins, it occurred to me that few buildings ever do. Bond movies invariably end like Quantum: with 007 single-handedly trashing not only the plans of would-be world dominators but also their hideouts, which is a pity because most of them are rather splendid. Think of the stupendous submersible lair of Stromberg in the Spy Who Loved Me with its circular underwater windows and 2001-style furniture, the hollowed-out volcano in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062512/\">You Only Live Twice</a>, the vertiginous control room in Moonraker, the elegant, if structurally unfeasible, ice palace in Die Another Day, and so forth. Some of the low-rent Bond baddies settle for oil rigs and such, but whatever the villain's crib of choice, you can guarantee it's going to get exploded. Those villains tend to put a great deal of effort into their bachelor pads, recruiting tasteful but evil architects, contractors, interior designers etc - it can't be easy. Then along comes Bond. The villains are the creators; Bond is the destroyer. He's basically an enemy of architecture. </p> <p>Even beyond the villains' lairs, Bond is a menace to the built environment. Think back to Casino Royale. For once there was no hideout at the end, so what does Bond do? He demolishes a priceless Venetian palazzo instead, not just smashing it up but actually sinking it into the lagoon. That seemed like an awful lot of damage to inflict in the name of a $150m theft, or whatever it was. How much would it cost to repair that building? Probably more. It's a similar story when it comes to historic cityscapes in Quantum of Solace. The chase across the rooftops of Siena leaves plenty of tiles in need of replacement, and culminates in Bond and his quarry crashing through a skylight, swinging about on pulleys and knocking over statues inside some antiquated chamber. </p> <p>If Bond has a problem with architecture it can probably be traced back to his creator, Ian Fleming, who was certainly no fan of modernism. He even went as far as to name one of his best baddies after the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2005/jun/03/film.hayfestival2005\"> Erno Goldfinger</a>, architect of London's Trellick Tower among others. Goldfinger the architect was apparently a neighbour of Fleming's in Hampstead, and the conservation-minded author was incensed when he demolished two Victorian houses to build his now-classic modern villas on <a href=\"http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-2willowroad\">Willow Road</a>. So he returned the insult by lending Goldfinger's name to his fictional gold-loving megalomaniac. Another, less-controversial version of the story has it that Fleming played golf with Goldfinger's wife's cousin, but either way, poor Erno tried and failed to stop Fleming appropriating his name, and had to bear the association for the rest of his life.</p> <p>Fleming's views on Le Corbusier were equally scathing, according to associates. In fact, on closer inspection, what is the archetypal Bond villain if not a modern architect? He is usually on a mission to \"improve\" humanity by wiping out the messy status quo and replacing it with some orderly, rational utopia of his own design. In Moonraker it's Hugo Drax who wants to start civilisation afresh in space. In the Spy Who Loved Me, it's Stromberg, who tries to wipe out the world's cities and create his own underwater world of Atlantis. \"The only hope for the future of mankind,\" he says, echoing Le Corbusier. \"We all have our dreams,\" responds Bond, resolving to ensure Stromberg's scorched-earth vision remains just that - a dream.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-339281535\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/gallery/2008/11/03/elrod1.jpg\" alt=\"James Bond: Elrod House which was featured in Diamonds Are Forever.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The archetypal villain interior ... Elrod House, which was featured in Diamonds Are Forever. Photograph: Alan Weintraub/Arcaid/Corbis</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The association between evil and modernism runs through many Bond movies. In Diamonds Are Forever, Sean Connery is taught a lesson by Bambi and Thumper in John Lautner's beautiful Elrod House in Palm Springs - all futuristic concrete domes, dynamic diagonals and circular furniture. Villain interiors are often modelled on similar modernists. <a href=\"http://www.jamesbondwiki.com/page/Osato's+Office?t=anon\">Osato's spacious office</a> in You Only Live Twice is rather Corbusier in Japan. Goldfinger's \"rumpus room\" is distinctly Frank Lloyd Wright, as is Hugo Drax's behind-the-waterfall lair in Moonraker, whose Mayan-patterned relief panels resemble those of <a href=\"http://www.ennishouse.org/\"> Wright's Ennis House</a>. The association continues in Quantum of Solace. When they find a mole within MI6, where do you think he lives? London's Barbican centre, of course. What kind of house does Bond himself live in, I wonder? Does he even have one?</p> <p>If Bond is the scourge of modern architecture, the movies at least have a champion in the form of Ken Adam, production designer extraordinaire. He was the man behind most of the classic Bond villain headquarters - from Dr No to Moonraker, and he designed and furnished them with great skill and devotion, as a <a href=\"http://www.thamesandhudson.com/en/1/9780500514146.mxs?5fe86a50875617acbcdaad9d1d171810&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\"> new book from Thames and Hudson</a> details. Adam studied architecture in London before the second world war, and he deserves to be considered one. Inarguably, he created some of the most memorable spaces of the modern era. Usually, we look at buildings in a city and wonder what they look like inside. Adam's spectacular interiors do the opposite, inviting us to wonder what the buildings look like on the outside. In reality of course, most of them were just flimsy sets in Pinewood studios whose ultimate fate was to be dismantled or blown up (like the Venetian palazzo in Casino Royale, and the interior of the Paranal Residencia in Quantum of Solace), but Adam's designs have been as influential as any \"real\" pieces of architecture.</p> <p>Bond might deploy his licence to trash with worrying abandon, but his motive should be seen less as a grudge against modern architecture and more an extreme form of criticism. He makes a mockery of buildings' functions and pricks the pomposity of their designers. Flat rooftops become platforms from which to dangle henchmen by their neckties; tall chimneys are there to drop wheelchair-bound villains down; corridors become racetracks, balconies vantage points, buildings as a whole turned into giant climbing frames, their carefully designed details relegated to mere footholds and escape routes. Perhaps that's just fanciful thinking on the part of someone who writes about architecture for a living, but as I loosen my bowtie, unholster my revolver and mix a stiff vodka martini, I can't help but identify with him.</p>",
  "<p>A tree fungus could provide green fuel that can be pumped directly into tanks, scientists say. The organism, found in the Patagonian rainforest, naturally produces a mixture of chemicals that is remarkably similar to diesel. </p> <p>\"This is the only organism that has ever been shown to produce such an important combination of fuel substances,\" said Gary Strobel, a plant scientist from Montana State University who led the work. \"We were totally surprised to learn that it was making a plethora of hydrocarbons.\"</p> <p>In principle, biofuels are attractive replacements for liquid fossil fuels used in transport that generate greenhouse gases. The European Union has set biofuel targets of 5.75% by 2010 and 10% by 2020. But critics say current biofuels scarcely reduce greenhouse gas emissions and cause food price rises and deforestation. Producing biofuels sustainably is now a target and this latest work has been greeted by experts as an encouraging step.</p> <p>The fungus, called Gliocladium roseum and discovered growing inside the ulmo tree (Eucryphia cordifolia) in northern Patagonia, produces a range of long-chain hydrocarbon molecules that are virtually identical to the fuel-grade compounds in existing fossil fuels. </p> <p>Details of the concoction, which Strobel calls \"mycodiesel\", will be published in the November issue of the journal Microbiology. \"The results were totally unexpected and very exciting and almost every hair on my arms stood on end,\" said Strobel.</p> <p>Many simple organisms, such as algae, are already known to make chemicals that are similar to the long-chain hydrocarbons present in transport fuel but, according to Strobel, none produce the explosive hydrocarbons with the high energy density of those in mycodiesel. Strobel said that the chemical mixture produced by his fungus could be used in a modern diesel engine without any modification. </p> <p>Another advantage of the G. roseum fungus is its ability to eat up cellulose. This is a compound that, along with lignin, makes up the cell walls in plants and is indigestible by most animals. As such, it makes up much of the organic waste currently discarded, such as stalks and sawdust. </p> <p>Converting this plant waste into useful fuels is a major goal for the biofuel industry, which currently uses food crops such as corn and has been blamed for high food prices. Normally, cellulosic materials are treated with enzymes that first convert it to sugar, with microbes then used to ferment the sugar into ethanol fuel.</p> <p>In contrast, G. roseum consumes cellulose directly to produce mycodiesel. \"Although the fungus makes less mycodiesel when it feeds on cellulose compared to sugars, new developments in fermentation technology and genetic manipulation could help improve the yield,\" said Strobel. \"In fact, the genes of the fungus are just as useful as the fungus itself in the development of new biofuels.\"</p> <p>\"Fungi are very important but we often overlook these organisms,\" Tariq Butt, a fungus expert at Swansea University, said: \"This is the first time that a fungus has been shown to produce hydrocarbons that could potentially be exploited as a source of fuel in the future. Concept-wise, the discovery and its potential applications are fantastic. However, more research is needed, as well as a pilot study to determine the costs and benefits. Even so, another potential supply of renewable fuel allows us to diversify our energy sources and is certainly an exciting discovery.\"</p> <p>John Loughhead, executive director of the UK Energy Research Centre, also welcomed the discovery but noted it is at its earliest stage of development. \"This appears another encouraging discovery that natural processes are more capable of producing materials of real value to mankind than we had previously known. It's another piece of evidence that there is real potential to adapt such processes to provide energy sources that can help reduce our need for, and dependence on, fossil fuels.\" </p> <p>The next stage for Strobel's work will be to refine the extraction of mycodiesel from the fungus. This requires more laboratory work to identify the most efficient ways to grow the organism and, perhaps, genetic modification of the fungus to improve yields. If successful, Strobel's technology will then need to be tested in a large-scale demonstration plant to solve any problems in scaling up to to commercial production. </p> <p>Strobel also said that his discovery raises questions about how fossil fuels were made in the first place. \"The accepted theory is that crude oil, which is used to make diesel, is formed from the remains of dead plants and animals that have been exposed to heat and pressure for millions of years. [But] if fungi like this are producing mycodiesel all over the rainforest, they may have contributed to the formation of fossil fuels.\"</p>",
  "<p>Pakistan delivered a blunt message yesterday to America's new military commander for the region, warning General David Petraeus on his first international trip since taking the job that US missile strikes inside Pakistan must stop.</p> <p>Petraeus, credited with pulling Iraq back from the brink, pointedly made Pakistan his first visit to the region, after last week assuming overall command of the Middle East and Central Asia, including Iraq and Afghanistan. Pakistan's co-operation is considered vital if the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan is to be quelled, but Islamabad has been incensed by US missile attacks inside its territory against suspected militants.</p> <p>\"Continuing drone attacks on our territory, which result in loss of precious lives and property, are counterproductive and difficult to explain by a democratically-elected government. It is creating a credibility gap,\" Pakistan's president Asif Zardari told Petraeus, according to a statement issued by the president's office.</p> <p>Petraeus also held meetings yesterday with Pakistani army chief Ashfaq Kayani and defence minister Ahmad Mukhtar, in which a similar message was reportedly conveyed. However, the strikes, which have intensified greatly over the past two months, killing dozens and causing uproar in Pakistan, are expected to go on.</p> <p>Before 9/11 Pakistan had backed the Taliban government in Kabul, and its all-powerful army is believed to still support elements within the Taliban, seeing the Karzai government as allied with arch-enemy India.</p> <p>\"Pakistan has been targeting different Taliban factions than the US,\" said Farrukh Saleem, executive director of the Centre for Research and Security Studies, a thinktank based in Islamabad. \"Pakistan is being encircled. There are Indian troops in the east, and Nato, the US and the Afghan national army to the west.\"</p> <p>Analysts believe that the missile attacks are damaging an already weak civilian government in Islamabad, following the restoration of democracy earlier this year after more than eight years of military rule, providing an opening that anti-American Islamist politicians can exploit.</p> <p>Last year Petraeus instigated a fresh approach in Iraq, with a \"surge\" of thousands of extra US troops and a successful ploy of separating the Sunni nationalist insurgents from al-Qaida, by turning the Iraqi Sunni Muslims against the global jihadists inspired by Osama bin Laden.</p> <p>In Afghanistan the two key tenets of this counter-insurgency strategy are expected to be replicated.</p> <p>\"Petraeus does understand that, while the basic template from Iraq is applicable in Afghanistan and Pakistan, there are many differences,\" said Kamran Bokhari, director of Middle East analysis at Stratfor, a private US geopolitical intelligence firm. \"The key difference is that Iraq was a sectarian conflict.\"</p> <p>Petraeus used the threat of Shia Muslim dominance in Iraq to entice the Sunnis into the mainstream, whereas there are already large Sunni majorities in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Washington and Kabul are starting to engage in tentative talks with figures associated with the Afghan Taliban, but past attempts at winning over \"moderate\" Taliban have failed.</p> <p>The US general will soon have a new boss following the US presidential election, with both candidates pledging to focus on Afghanistan and provide more troops, especially Barack Obama, who has repeatedly said that Afghanistan and Pakistan is where the fight against terrorism must be won.</p>",
  "<p>There's a well-worn cliche suggesting that men should try everything once, except incest and morris dancing. A third taboo should now be added: Ugg boots. </p> <p>As all red-blooded men would acknowledge, there was a moment when Pamela Anderson swanning around Venice Beach dressed in the unlikely combination of her world famous red Baywatch swimsuit and knee-high sheepskin Uggs did cut a certain trailer-trash dash. Since then, the Australian boots have proved themselves to be unstoppable and above fashion; bulletproof survivors of trends, tastes and global warming. </p> <p>Now, disturbingly, they are increasingly being worn by men. Ronnie Wood (so thin, he looks like Cheryl Cole from the waist down) joins Brad Pitt, Justin Timberlake and Harvey Keitel (who should know better). This is one area of fashion where celebrity endorsement offers a warning, not a recommendation. </p> <p>A man wearing these sloppy, formless, infantilising aberrations on his feet has nothing to do with fashionability. Uggs suggest instead that you have abandoned sartorial dignity and succumbed to the evils of comfort, practicality and convenience.</p> <p>A well-dressed man should never choose comfort as his number-one consideration. From there, it is a slippery slope to elasticated waistbands, \"Crocs\" (great for kids and people who work as fish-gutters - unacceptable for everyone else) and buying oversized fleeces at the service station. </p> <p>Wood is also letting the side down because, historically, rock'n'roll men have been impervious to cold snaps.

  "<p>Jack Straw, the justice secretary, is facing a cabinet-level revolt over his plans for a British bill of rights and responsibilities, and has sent his justice minister, Michael Wills, on a mission to re-explain the proposals to sceptical Whitehall departments.</p> <p>Some cabinet ministers believe there is no demand for such a complex constitutional development and it will be regarded as irrelevant in times of economic stress or, at worst, be highly unpopular.</p> <p>Despite a hostile response from within the cabinet, the green paper on a bill of rights and responsibilities is due to be published before Christmas, justice department sources insisted.</p> <p>Andrew Dismore, the chairman of the all-party joint human rights select committee, said he had been promised the green paper would be published next week. \"If that is not now happening, and there is yet more delay, my committee will have something to say,\" Dismore said.</p> <p>Straw is arguing that it is worth bringing together British rights and duties in one document to build on the existing controversial Human Rights Act, the legislation passed a decade ago which incorporates the European convention on human rights into British law.</p> <p>Straw would also like to introduce the concept of welfare-based or economic rights, especially in the field of education and health. They might also cover areas such as rights to a clean environment.</p> <p>Last week's cabinet discussion was ordered by Gordon Brown, who first set out his support in principle for a British bill of rights and duties in a governance of Britain green paper when he became prime minister in 2007.</p> <p>But Straw faced hostility from ministers led by the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, who are warning a British bill of rights will strengthen the hand of the judiciary over parliament, leading to further public alienation from the concept of human rights.</p> <p>One minister said: \"The opposition to all this came from right across the cabinet. The politics of this has not been thought through.\"</p> <p>Smith is being backed by Home Office lawyers who feel they have a hard enough time trying to protect their decisions from the impact of the Human Rights Act. Straw remains convinced he has the backing of Brown, although Downing Street may be shaken by the cabinet criticism.</p> <p>Straw believes that Britain's unpopular human rights law could be made more palatable if a new bill balanced the existing emphasis on rights with a new emphasis on duties and responsibilities.</p> <p>He has also been told by some ministers that proposals to give citizens new economic rights will be a recipe for confusion, since they are unlikely in the first instance to be enforceable in the UK courts. Many of these proposed economic rights are not contained in the European convention, but have been included in the more recent EU charter of fundamental rights, a charter that is not applicable in British law.</p> <p>It is also being said by some ministers that the Human Rights Act, 10 years old this weekend, is still too new and too unpopular to justify a fresh round of new rights-based legislation.</p>",
  "<p>Britain will suffer the deepest recession among the EU's mature economies, with a contraction of 1% next year and growth of only 0.4% in 2010, according to the European commission.</p> <p>Its half-yearly forecast published yesterday shows UK unemployment rising from 5.3% in 2007 to 7.1%, or about 2.25 million, in 2009 with the budget deficit and government debt also surging.</p> <p>The deficit is seen jumping to 5.6% next year and 6.5%, or \u00a394bn, in 2010 while debt is forecast to rise some 15 percentage points to about 60% in 2010-11 - both above so-called Maastricht treaty limits. The bleak forecasts blow a hole in the government's much-vaunted assertion it has been running the European Union's model economy for the past decade.</p> <p>The UK forecast was part of an overall bleak outlook for Europe, which is in or close to recession. The EC is forecasting EU growth of 0.2% in 2009 and eurozone growth of 0.1%.</p> <p>EU economic experts warned that, if the financial crisis continues or deteriorates and credit conditions tighten, the 15-strong eurozone could experience a 1% contraction in 2009.</p> <p>Germany, France and Italy, the eurozone's three biggest economies, will stagnate next year while Ireland will contract 0.9% before recovering to 2.4% growth in 2010. Ireland's budget deficit is scheduled to be higher than Britain's, at 6.8% in 2009 and 7.2% in 2010.</p> <p>Only Estonia and Latvia will suffer deeper recessions than Britain in 2009, falling 1.2% and 2.7% respectively.</p> <p>Presenting his \"dark\" forecast, Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, economic and monetary affairs commissioner, said it was highly uncertain and precarious given the fragile state of global financial markets.</p> <p>He indicated an easing of tensions in inter-bank lending after the coordinated stabilisation plans adopted in recent weeks by key governments. But he insisted the EC would stick to its revised stability and growth pact, with the UK expected to receive a sharp warning note early in the new year. Britain is in the so-called excessive deficit procedure but cannot be sanctioned as it is outside the eurozone.</p> <p>The EC's senior economists said: \"The central outlook [for Britain] envisages a marked fall in private consumption in 2009 and 2010, driven by more restrictive borrowing conditions and lower household wealth.\" Treasury officials refused to comment before this month's pre-budget report from chancellor Alistair Darling.</p> <p>The commission sees a gradual recovery in the eurozone and most of the rest of the EU-27 in the second half of next year but this is unlikely in Britain until 2010, with business investment shrinking until the end of 2009. Inflation, however, is likely to fall to 1.2% in 2010. Its forecast comes ahead of this week's expected moves by the Bank of England and European Central Bank to cut interest rates by up to half a percentage point as governments adopt new fiscal stimulus packages to help lead the way out of recession across Europe.</p>",
  "<p>It was already going to be an exciting week for black communities across the world, but when a team of West Indian cricketers won the Stanford cricket match, and then, 10 seconds before the finish line, Lewis Hamilton made his move on Timo Glock, Dotun Adebayo, presenting his BBC London radio show, couldn't help himself. Would this be, he asked, \"the beginning of the greatest week ever in black history\"?</p> <p>The issue of role models is, of course, a perennial debate within and outside the black community - who are they? And where are they, when they are so urgently needed? Will this week prove a kind of tipping point? Simon Woolley, director and co-founder of Operation Black Vote, who was a guest on Adebayo's show, sincerely hopes so - and believes he has reason to. For one thing, he is emotionally exhausted by the drama of Hamilton's win - because, \"it's like watching your child race, such an emotional rollercoaster - that's the emotional investment we've got\". For him, and everybody else who recognised themselves in the young mixed-race man from Stevenage, the win was particularly piquant because, \"it's about winning against adversity. Yes, because he's a young black man we're proud. But we've watched him face the most wretched racist abuse. Our journey to sucess is always peppered by obstacles of racism. So when we do succeed, particularly with great dignity ... \"</p> <p>For another, he has been seeing the effect of Obama's candidacy, from day to day, and is bowled over by it. A couple of weeks ago, he ran an event in Brixton, called Equanomics, a project that looks at political and economic empowerment for black communities. \"We would have been happy if 50 showed up - but we got 300, many under 25. Look, we've got a black man who could be the most powerful person in the world. He's speaking our language, he looks like us - our organisation is riding the crest of an Obama wave. It's the dawn of a new era.\" </p> <p>For nine months, Operation Black Vote has been running a political mentoring scheme they have been calling the Barack Obama Generation, in which established politicians, mostly in the Welsh Assembly, have agreed to mentor young political hopefuls from minorities. Nine people stepped up, and three - all political novices - are already in positions where they might be elected: Mari Rees has been selected as a Labour candidate for the winnable seat of Pembrokeshire (if she won, she would be the first black politician to be elected in Wales); Elizabeth Musa has been nominated to stand for election to the Welsh Assembly in four years' time; and Shazia Awan has been shortlisted for a Tory seat.</p> <p>But the effect need not be this direct. \"The thing about Lewis Hamilton, and to a big extent Barack Obama,\" says Diane Abbott, MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, \"is that they are running counter to stereotype. They're not sportsmen - obviously formula one motor racing is a sport, but it's not a physical sport. There's this idea that black men have physical prowess, which is not, in itself, unremarkable. Where it's about how fast you can run and how strong you are, you will get black champions. What is interesting about Hamilton, and to a lesser extent Tiger Woods, is that we're talking now about very cerebral sports.\" </p> <p>She has also been interested to see, in the US media, mentions of African-American men \"generally carrying themselves with more pride. Because you've got this black man who could become president, and in any event has been centre-stage in this campaign. I think it does have an effect - we're in a society, both in America and Britain, where black men are demonised and vilified. I mean most weeks you can pick up a newspaper and unless they're a sportsman it means they've killed someone or they're mad. So it's a very good thing to see a positive image of a black man. And more important, in a way, with Barack Obama, a black family. For Americans, the </p> <p>First family is a bit like the royal family for us. So with Barack we're going to have a black family that's a symbol of nationhood, and I think that's quite profound.\"</p> <p>Woolley agrees with this, too. \"On a very basic level, on a daily basis, we see ourselves portrayed in the media as villains. But we can look at this dynamic young black kid, and think, with a bit of luck my child could follow in his success.\" Woolley's partner is Spanish, so they have mixed-race children, and looking at Hamilton and Obama, \"we can say to our children - they look like you. Unless you've got a black child or a mixed-race child the profundity of having such role models would be difficult to grasp.\" </p> <p>Which is all true, but others caution that their achievements are so huge, and so specific and arcane, that the effect, while galvanising in a general sort of way, may not trickle down to, say, a teenager struggling with her GCSEs in Leeds. As Michael Eboda, who for years was editor of the New Nation newspaper, and is now CEO of Powerful Media, which has just published a list of Britain's 100 most influential black people, points out, \"You have to have a particular set of circumstances to do what Hamilton has done: you have to be quite small, be able to raise a lot of money, and be ultra-talented - most kids know that's not what they're going to be.\" </p> <p>He argues that if what Lewis and Obama have done inspires other people, that's brilliant, \"but we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that there are lots of other people who are a lot more accessible.\" He often takes the list into schools, and shows it to young black men, in particular. </p> <p>Stereotypes come in all shapes and sizes, and so people assume, for example, the black \"youth\" would be particularly interested in footballers or rappers. But there are only two sportsmen on it. \"They're far, far, far more impressed by a guy like Michael Prest, one of our panellists, whose business turns over a billion a year. They find that far more impressive. It's what they really want to do - a lot of them are interested in music and stuff but a hell of lot of them say they want to be a CEO, or run a company. Or they say they want to be a lawyer, a doctor. You meet the odd one who wants to be a footballer. But they know that either you're good at it or you're not.\" They're interested in Tidjane Thiam, the group finance director for Prudential, who's being groomed to be CEO; they're interested in the most influential person on the list, Dr Mo Ibrahim, who started off working at BT, set up his own company, sold it for for $3.4bn, and now runs a foundation dedicated to promoting good governance in Africa - these they see as possible paths. As for Obama in particular, \"I think we kind of have to look at ourselves and say what are we doing over here? There are a lot of people in very powerful positions here, and they're the ones we in Britain have to look to. I'm not a great fan always looking at America.\" </p> <p>And in the end, the ideal, the hope, is that something more complex and much greater can be achieved; that what the British actor and playwright Kwame Kwei-Armah calls \"a new narrative\" can begin. \"In the past I have been reluctant to accept the mantle of role model but whether you accept it or not, you are,\" says Patricia Scotland, Baroness Scotland of Asthal and now attorney general for England and Wales. In 1991, she became the youngest person to take silk since William Pitt the Younger, and the first black woman to be made a QC. She says she was particularly moved during that year by a father who told her that his nine-year-old daughter had clipped a picture of her out of a newspaper and announced: \"I'm going to do that.\" She now has a degree in law and has been called to the bar. She doesn't tell me what colour this nine-year-old was because, for her, that is not the only point. </p> <p>Of course there is a long way to go, and the website that received a barrage of racist taunts about Hamilton is yet another example. \"But,\" says Baroness Scotland, \"I would say to all young people, not just black young people, 'You can achieve!' Irrespective of your background, your ethnicity, you faith, or your sexual orientation. I think it's a good time for people and not just black people. It's very important for all our children of whatever colour and whatever faith to try and see individuals as that - as individuals who have huge potential to achieve. And I would love us to finally get to the stage when each of our children will look at their own talents as being the final arbiter of what they will do, and not an outward manifestation, or a sexual or other orientation. So they won't say I can't do this, because I am white, or black, or Jewish or Christian or Muslim, or I'm gay or I am straight. That they are able just to say, I am a person of talent. We need to create an environment where that talent is released.\" And to that we can only say amen.</p> <h2>'If Obama gets in, I'm moving to America'</h2> <p><strong>Young black British men on the role models that give them hope</strong></p> <p><strong>Anthony Lawrence, 20, student</strong></p> <p>To know that there might be a black president and to see Hamilton winning makes me feel happy inside, man, because I'm black. There aren't enough role models for the younger generation. Me, I never had a father, and my mum died when I was young. I never had anyone except for my grandma. I wouldn't listen to her, I was always on the street doing what I wanted to do. As soon as Barack Obama came on the scene, I listened to everything he says. He speaks to me, he makes me think that there is another way out of this wartorn world. One of my friends died the other day. He got stabbed. He was 16. I cried, man. It made me feel like I'm the next one to go. </p> <p><strong>Peter Okeowo, 22, student</strong></p> <p>I was watching the race, and I thought Lewis was going to lose - when he won I was really relieved. I felt so proud. He did well despite criticism and I was really happy for him. Now </p> <p>I want Obama to win. I was discussing with my friends whether one day in this country will we have a black prime minister. Most people were saying never. But hopefully it will happen. </p> <p><strong>Moboshir Ali, 19, currently looking for work</strong></p> <p>Lewis Hamilton? Brilliant. Brilliant. Brilliant. Now he's in the history books. It was so good. I don't care about Obama, though. I give up on politics. I really don't think it will change my life. Politicians don't represent me. I can't do grand-prix racing because I'm no good at driving, but maybe I will get into IT.</p> <p><strong>Joshua Ellison, 17, student</strong></p> <p>Hackney is my hometown, it's easy to blend in - but if Obama gets in, I'm moving to America, bwoy! I'm excited about Lewis Hamilton, too, and really happy for him. If there are black people achieving, it's there in the history books and will live on and on.</p> <p>I want to move to America where there are more opportunities. We all talk about it in class. Some of the kids I know, all they talk about is guns, and if they have someone to look up to, it gives them another option. </p> <p><strong>Duane Mayers, 20, chef</strong></p> <p>It would be great to have a black president. He's grown up the way we've grown up. I've heard about his background and family. He's had that childhood and knows how we live so he will know how to change that. Lewis Hamilton is all right but not such a role model as Obama. </p> <p><strong>Kenny Julian, 18, student</strong></p> <p>I'm not a politics person but it's good to give black people a shot at being president. Give them a chance to prove themselves. </p> <p><strong>Sile Entee, 21, student</strong></p> <p>It's hopeful, but if he turns president, they're going to assassinate him. America's going to have a civil war.</p> <p><strong>Michael Morris, 24, student</strong></p> <p>I rate Barack Obama. He's stronger than the other people. Lewis Hamilton? I rate him too. I'm Jamaican and English, mixed-race. I'm proud to have those mixed-race role models.</p> <p><strong>Rennal Edwards, 15, school student</strong></p> <p>Lewis and Obama, although they're doing different jobs, they're linked. They must both have struggled to be where they are. They've shown it is possible - that dreams do come true.</p> <p>Obama's already shown how we've got a much more modern society, a multicultural society that allows everyone to have an opportunity to be in power, not just one race. And to rule America - that's pretty significant. It means a lot to the world, and to me. The States tends to be followed by the rest of the world. They've let people come into America from all backgrounds and show that they can do well, not just in politics but in all sorts of things, in everything.</p> <p>Lewis Hamilton, now - he's come from not such a high-status background, which makes him a really good role model for people such as myself. I'm going through the experiences he went though when he was a kid. Their success will cut down a lot on racism in the world. Obama, especially, has shown us the way to a better place.</p> <p><strong>Arron Thompson, 16, school student</strong></p> <p>Great to see Lewis Hamilton in the headlines. It'll be a shame if Obama doesn't get there - he's gone so far. His mum's white, maybe that helps. Maybe it helps stop white people getting jealous.</p> <p><strong>Julius Soares, 19, engineering student</strong></p> <p>A black man being president! It makes me feel that in the future I can be whatever I want to be. He's inspired me, definitely. Obama really will make a difference if he becomes president. The fact that his mum's white makes no difference. He's black and he says he's black and that's how it is. Lewis Hamilton too, he also shows that if you just believe, you can achieve whatever you want to achieve. He said that he believed, and that was what counts.<br><strong>Interviews by Anita Sethi and Martin Wainwright</strong></p> <p>\u2022 The inside track: Gemma Briggs speaks to the people behind Lewis Hamilton's success <a href=\"http://theguardian.com/sport\">theguardian.com/sport</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Thursday November 6 2008.

  "<p>The classroom has walls covered in artwork, computers dotted around and a model of a historical warrior. But a second glance at the warrior's armour reveals that it's constructed out of bedpans. And while on one side of the room there are secondary pupils working on their GCSEs, on the other side is a child in a hospital bed, surrounded by a group of primary children and a mess of paper, paint, glue and glitter, making puppets and masks. Intersperse a few drips and broken legs, and you have the Royal Free hospital children's school (RFHCS), in Hampstead, north London, one of 26 special schools that educate children when ill-health means that they are unable to attend their usual school. </p> <p>This hospital school is designated a \"special school\" in local authority terminology, and the work is clearly specialised. At the Royal Free, the school's classroom is the only full-time teaching room, squeezed in between the two children's wards. A full timetable following the national curriculum is provided for children who are well enough to attend. </p> <p><strong>Calm environment</strong></p> <p>Andrew Hulstrom, 17, recently left RFHCS, where he was a day student while receiving treatment. He took GCSEs in English and maths, plus entry-level 3 for science, and is now studying for his electrical-technical technology certificate at a mainstream college. He singles out the \"calm environment\" and \"flexibility of the timetable\" as his favourite aspects. He says: \"It made it possible for me to gain confidence in attending [a mainstream] school.\" </p> <p>The school has six teachers, half working part-time, who cover the whole curriculum. Each teacher tutors at least two subjects, at primary and secondary level. They have only 10 minutes each morning to prepare the day's lessons, since the age and level of many of their pupils - the wards' admissions - can change daily. </p> <p>Despite these practical problems, the teachers at RFHCS are passionate about their jobs. \"Like most hospital schools, we have a low staff turnover,\" says headteacher Jude Chalk, who has worked at the school since January 2007, and was previously head of primary at a school for children with learning difficulties. \"Working here you get a different buzz to teaching a big class in a mainstream school. It can be stressful, but it's also hugely rewarding. </p> <p>\"Hospital schools have a therapeutic as well an academic function - it's really important for the kids in terms of normality, and distraction. School helps the kids to recover from operations and takes their mind off serious illness.\" </p> <p>Chalk's voice is infused with pride as she tells me some of the school's success stories. They include academic achievement, but also more fundamental changes. \"Recently, two sets of parents told me that since starting at our school their children were sleeping at night. That's a huge improvement in their lives,\" she says.</p> <p>As a hospital school, the RFHCS is funded by the local authority, but has its own governing body and budget. Children in hospitals without schools have their education organised by medical pupil referral units, with teachers who travel around, teaching in children's wards and in homes. </p> <p><strong>Emotional factors</strong></p> <p>There are challenges in working with sick children. Most are in hospital for short stays, and staff have to build relationships very quickly. There are also emotional factors. One teacher recalls a student with leukaemia who took biology A-level. \"He discovered that he did really well, and then died the next day. I was proud to have helped him achieve it, but it is hard when the children die. The teachers support each other. Counselling is also available.\" </p> <p>The school at Great Ormond Street hospital for children is much larger due to the hospital's specialism, and staff have to focus their resources. \"We concentrate on long-stay children, who are most reliant on us for their education,\" says headteacher Yvonne Hill. The hospital school also receives charity funding. </p> <p>Hill is keen to focus on the realities of teaching in a hospital. \"The challenges are immense but very rewarding,\" she says. \"Staff are presented with the most diverse ability range from each end of the spectrum. There are also medical constraints of working with children in isolation, and the need to ensure equipment is ultra-clean, that staff are neither transmitting infection nor likely to acquire infections, plus the challenges of meeting the national curriculum and Ofsted's agenda in exceptional settings.</p> <p>\"Some parents are initially unaware of a school, and clearly their priority is to see their child get better. But they comment that the school has a positive effect on self-esteem and confidence, as well as helping their child to cope with the trauma of hospitalisation.\"</p> <p>None of the teachers I speak to want to publicly voice concerns, but there's a collective sense of feeling vulnerable to the decisions of stakeholders, including local authorities and hospital trusts. New NHS objectives feed into the organisation of hospital schools. At RFHCS, the previous headteacher had to act after a research paper proposed that paediatric hospital beds in north London should be concentrated in fewer sites. No children's ward would mean no hospital school; to ensure survival, the school began to accept outpatients, with mental health and medical problems, as day students. \"Frequently, I'll need to phone up the day kids at 8am to motivate them into school,\" says Chalk. </p> <p>Local authority bureaucracy remains a problem for all hospital schools. The Evelina children's hospital school is based at Guy's and St Thomas' hospital in Waterloo, central London. The hospital moved to a new site in 2005, which, for the school, involved moving from the education authority of Southwark to Lambeth. The headteacher, Manuela Beste, says upheaval lies ahead. </p> <p>\"We have various sites, and our psych unit is still in Southwark, but our ward school, dialysis unit school and classrooms are in Lambeth,\" says Beste. \"It looks like we're being asked to wind up the school for Southwark and open again under Lambeth. It's time-consuming, and we're so busy - last year, we had more than 1,000 children use the school.\" Beste remains positive, however: \"Hopefully, we'll have a better school at the end.\"</p>",
  "<p>It would be wonderful to think that the intense interest with which Europeans are following today's US presidential election might be matched by Americans watching the European parliamentary elections in June 2009. Today the US takes part in the most exciting, and potentially the most important, presidential election in decades. In two months there will be a new administration and Congress in Washington DC. Across the Atlantic - the necessity to ratify the Lisbon treaty notwithstanding - there will by next summer be a new European parliament, and by next autumn in all likelihood a new European commission. </p> <p>This transition on both sides of the Atlantic presents a fresh challenge and a huge opportunity - to relaunch transatlantic relations on a new and more positive footing. We need to put differences and misunderstandings behind us. In Washington and Brussels we should seize the chance to engage in new thinking and commit ourselves to work together on a common agenda for prosperity and peace, not just in Europe and North America but across the globe.</p> <p>We need to prepare the ground immediately. That's why I intend to invite the winner of today's election to come and address the European parliament next year. I would like the new president to visit us in April, on perhaps his first European tour, immediately before the Nato summit. The last time - indeed the only time - that a US president addressed a plenary session of the European parliament was when Ronald Reagan did so in 1985 in Strasbourg, during the cold war years.</p> <p>We have already been strengthening links between the European parliament and Congress at all levels - between parliamentary delegations, between policy committees, between political groups, and between administrative staff. We will continue that important process, speaking frankly as colleagues and friends. At the same time, the symbolic value of a presidential visit to strengthening the bonds between our two great democratic systems cannot be underestimated.</p> <p>The emerging global agenda - of turmoil in the financial markets, climate change, energy security, the Middle East, terrorism and international crime, western responses to the rise of China and India, demographic change and ageing societies - requires legislators to work together on an international scale. If the EU and the US can do this successfully, we can be a major force for prosperity, peace and civilised values.</p> <p>We have a new political commitment to building a barrier-free transatlantic single market in goods and services. Both the US Congress and the European parliament will need to agree to many regulatory and other changes involved in this long-term project. </p> <p>Our work also needs to address public opinion directly, especially among the young. Successive opinion surveys show that the faith of the younger generation of Europeans in the US has been falling in recent years. The bond of mutual trust and admiration is becoming weaker. This is worrying and needs to be reversed.</p> <p>The tensions that arose from the handling of Iraq go a long way to explaining this. There is a sense of hope by many in Europe that the new US president will seek to reverse this trend by demonstrating America's willingness to operate on the international stage in a spirit of partnership.</p> <p>We in the EU must aim to put transatlantic relations on a firmer, more positive and more successful foundation. All of us in our different ways can help make this happen. As parliamentarians, business people and members of civic society, we should make reality a vibrant transatlantic partnership that can offer hope to the world.</p> <p>\u2022 Hans-Gert P\u00f6ttering is president of the European parliament <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/president\">europarl.europa.eu/president</a></p>",
  "<p>Boris Johnson has been mayor of London for six months: long enough to judge what kind of political leader he is becoming - and what his ambitions are. It is also sufficient time to discern longer-term trends within the Labour party as it picks itself up after last May's grim local election results.</p> <p>The first thing to note about the Johnson style is how different it is from his predecessor's. Ken Livingstone operated a tightly knit mayor's office and a quasi-Thatcherite economic policy, while his Conservative successor has a cabinet-style administration that has shifted its focus towards quality-of-life issues. Ken's clique spoke only with its master's voice, while those in Boris's have their own identities.</p> <p>The new mayor's office has taken virtually the full six months to settle down. He has suffered two deputy mayor resignations, of Ray Lewis and then Tim Parker. Lady Bracknell would not have been alone in seeing this as carelessness. In fairness, for any mayor taking over an empire as big as London the transition would be difficult. As we will see, American political changeovers see hundreds of ready-made aides moving into the new White House. Crucially, there is a two-month gap between the election and inauguration. Ken Livingstone had such an interval in 2000.</p> <p>Johnson was, by his own early admission, something of a leap in the dark for London. He had no experience of government and few people lined up to run his mayor's office. Initially, the Conservative party hierarchy - in the shape of Nicholas Boles - helped set things up. But the Borisocracy has gradually asserted its independence from Cameron &amp; Co. What operates today is a \"cabinet\" consisting of three appointed deputy mayors and another one statutorily appointed from the London assembly. All four are experienced politicians.</p> <p>In particular, Sir Simon Milton as deputy mayor for policy and planning has stabilised the administration. Understated and clever, Milton - previously leader of Westminster council and the all-party Local Government Association - has calmed the febrile atmosphere at City Hall. The other two appointed deputies are Kit Malthouse, who gained prominence over the removal of Sir Ian Blair; and Ian Clement, who handles government relations.</p> <p>It now seems many fears expressed in the Guardian and elsewhere about Johnson were misplaced. In a classic Blairite move, he has leaned to the centre-left, supporting the London Living Wage, giving reasonable prominence to the environment, and extolling a Keynesian boost to the capital's soon to be depressed economy. He has not proved to be the wicked racist foreseen by some. Most of the Livingstone multi- cultural events in Trafalgar Square continue unabated. He is backing Barack Obama to win today's US election.</p> <p>The economic downturn may help him. If there had been no global financial implosion, Labour would have blamed Johnson's administration for every weakness in the capital's economy and any slowdown in development. As it is, the recession can be pinned neatly on either Gordon Brown as chancellor or even the previous mayor's gung-ho policies. Within his own party, the damage recently suffered by his longer-term rival George Osborne will also have seen punters buying stock in Boris.</p> <p>Where the six-month mayor remains weakest is the continuing lack of a fully understood narrative for the future of London. Livingstone was exceptionally good at selling a clear picture of his city and its objectives. Johnson has started to come up with tactical ideas, for example for tackling knife crime, but a full picture of what he wants to achieve is unclear. He has announced he will publish an economic recovery action plan. The extent to which this document and revisions to the catch-all London Plan create a clear picture of the capital's future will be a full test of his capacity to govern.</p> <p>Livingstone remains a brooding presence. He has set himself - and his former office - up as a kind of government-in-exile. He turns up at City Hall for key public meetings as if still attempting to exorcise the trauma of loss. It is virtually certain he will stand for mayor again in 2012. Interestingly, the Tories are more relaxed about this than many Labour supporters. On a positive note, he has turned into an excellent talk radio host, broadcasting to Londoners with fluency and intelligence.</p> <p>In the short period since he took office on May 5, Johnson has changed the terms on which the London mayor is judged. Whereas Ken was assessed in terms of his governmental competence and forensic understanding of political power, Boris is seen to a significant extent in terms of his huge and unique personality. How long this will last is difficult to judge. Major increases in unemployment and business failures won't be forgotten because the mayor is benign and amusing.</p> <p>Finally, it is essential to understand Johnson still has higher ambitions. His utterances are now purged of anything that might give offence. Signals are emitted from City Hall that are intended to be picked up in galaxies far beyond the M25. In the same way it was impossible for him to become mayor of London, he could never, ever, be prime minister.</p> <p>\u2022 Tony Travers is the director of the Greater London Group at the LSE <a href=\"mailto:a.travers@lse.ac.uk\">a.travers@lse.ac.uk</a></p>",

The 38.9 reading reported yesterday by the Institute for Supply Management was dramatically below September's reading of 43.5. A reading above 50 signals growth.

  "<p>Gordon Brown's attempts to promote himself as the man to lead Britain through the economic crisis suffered a double setback yesterday as banks warned they would not pass interest rate cuts on to customers and the EU said the recession would hit the UK harder than any other country in Europe.</p> <p>The prime minister had hoped to use the keynote speech of his trip to the Gulf states to restate calls on banks to ease lending conditions for families and businesses after the government intervened to save three of the UK's biggest financial institutions with \u00a337bn of public money. Brown said: \"Having helped to strengthen the global banking system through recapitalisation, governments must ensure that the money is used to enable a resumption of lending to families and businesses.\"</p> <p>But a senior banker travelling with Brown's party, David Hodgkinson, chief operating officer at HSBC, overshadowed the speech by suggesting that banks would not make mortgages cheaper even if, as expected, the Bank of England cuts interest rates on Thursday.</p> <p>Speaking to reporters in the Gulf, Hodgkinson said: \"Clearly if interest rates are down significantly, the rates for borrowing will go down. But I am not going to say it is absolutely linear, because it depends on the particular [situation] and the risk.\"</p> <p>He expected there to be some \"stickiness\" should the Bank of England's monetary policy committee cut rates.</p> <p>He later told ITN: \"We will do our best but I will not give a categorical commitment that they will come down.</p> <p>\"We would listen. We are in a very, very turbulent position and it's very hard to predict what markets will do.\"</p> <p>Hodgkinson was immediately slapped down by the prime minister's official spokesman who said that if official rates were cut, consumers could expect to see full benefits.</p> <p>A government spokesman said: \"The prime minister is very clear that we are taking the action to ensure that more mortgage holders and small businesses feel the benefit.\"</p> <p>Though the monetary policy committee agreed an emergency rate cut of half a percentage point last month, only half of banks have cut their standard variable rates. The website moneyfacts.co.uk revealed that 82% of lenders had not passed on in full the last three base rate cuts - a one-point reduction in total - and 57% of lenders passed on half or less of the last three base rate cuts.</p> <p>The European commission's half-yearly forecast, published yesterday, said Britain will suffer the deepest recession among the EU's mature economies, with a 1% contraction next year and growth of only 0.4% in 2010. It showed UK unemployment rising from 5.3% in 2007 to 7.1% - about 2.25 million people - next year, with the budget deficit and government debt also surging.</p> <p>Hodgkinson was supported by his own bank, which released a statement saying he was only speaking \"common sense\". Eric Daniels, the Lloyds TSB chief executive, also backed him. Revealing details of his bank's merger with HBOS, Daniels said there was a \"common misconception\" about the way financial products were priced and many were not related to the base rate, which the Bank of England sets, but to Libor - the rate at which banks lend to each other.</p> <p>Daniels also risked fuelling government anger when he said that his merged bank would not expect to have its lending policies influenced by government.</p> <p>At the same time, Alistair Darling and Bank governor Mervyn King admitted to MPs there had been lapses in bank governance but denied that taxpayers had been \"taken for a mug\" in the bailouts.</p> <p>Details of the Lloyds-HBOS merger revealed yesterday raised concerns among unions about the impact on jobs, particularly when Lloyds raised its forecast of cost reductions by \u00a3500m to \u00a31.5bn. More than half the promised savings are forecast for the retail banking arm - the branch networks of Lloyds TSB, Halifax and Bank of Scotland - where 21 initiatives are earmarked to save \u00a3790m a year by the end of 2011.</p> <p>There were also questions about the future of the 200-year-old TSB name which is being eradicated from the holding company, which will be called Lloyds Banking Group on completion of the takeover early next year. Daniels said Lloyds would become the \"umbrella brand\" and other details were still being worked on.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, Vince Cable, said it was difficult to see the justification for not passing on the full benefit of any rate cut. \"Banks are only too happy to increase the cost of lending when interest rates go up,\" he said. \"For customers to get a fair deal, this needs to be a two-way street.\"</p>",
  "<p>The most senior Chinese negotiator to visit the breakaway island of Taiwan in 60 years arrived to a warm official welcome in the capital Taipei yesterday, but faces popular protests as he discusses closer ties with the mainland.</p> <p>The relationship between China and Taipei has thawed since the election of Ma Ying-jeou as Taiwan's president in the spring. China's Communist rulers, who claim the island as sovereign territory and have threatened war should Taiwan's leaders attempt to formalise its independence, have reciprocated this warm feeling in an attempt to reduce the chances of conflict.</p> <p>\"The step is not easy and is a crystallisation of the joint efforts of many compatriots across the strait,\" Chen said, according to Xinhua, mainland China's state-run news agency. </p> <p>But tensions remain and thousands of police guarded the airport for the arrival of Chen Yunlin, China's top negotiator on Taiwan. Nets and barbed wire were erected outside his hotel as a pro-independence group promised NT$1,000 (\u00a319) to anyone who could hit his body with eggs and NT$10,000 to those who hit his face.</p> <p>A convoy of about two dozen taxis cruised through the streets as Chen arrived, blaring their horns and using loudspeakers to broadcast anti-China slogans. Last month protesters in southern Taiwan pushed Chen's deputy, Zhang Mingqing, to the ground as he visited a temple on an informal visit.</p> <p>Despite the hostile reception, the working groups reached a tentative agreement yesterday to sign agreements on direct passenger flights, cargo flights and cargo shipping.</p> <p>Chen is the most senior Chinese official to set foot on Taiwan since the end of the civil war in 1949, when defeated Nationalists fled there. </p> <p>Ma was elected in part because of his pledge to improve relations and help the island benefit from the mainland's economic boom. </p> <p>Shortly after his inauguration negotiating teams for the two governments met in Beijing after a long break, when they signed a deal to begin regular weekend commercial flights between Chinese and Taiwanese cities. But Ma's poll ratings have since plunged as Taiwan's economy falters, and many voters remain nervous at the possibility of greater Chinese influence.</p> <p>Chen is due to meet Chiang Pin-kung, the chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation, today when they are expected to sign agreements that increase the charter flight schedule to every other day and open maritime shipping lanes. They are also expected to discuss economic cooperation as a way to fight the global financial crisis.</p> <p>\"It is imperative that the two sides join to help each other to cope,\" Chen said yesterday, according to Xinhua.</p> <p>Raymond Wu, a political risk consultant in Taipei, said: \"People need to have indications that Taiwan is holding firm on its claim to sovereignty.\"</p> <p>The opposition Democratic Progressive party (DPP) staged a rally of around 2,000 people outside parliament last night.</p> <p>\"If things keep on like this, Taiwan's economy will irreversibly rely fully on China,\" the DPP chairwoman, Tsai Ing-wen, warned in a letter to newspapers. \"In the not-too-distant future, would Taiwan still keep its sovereignty?\"</p> <p>Chen has also said that China will again offer to give two pandas to Taiwan, an offer that the Beijing government first made in 2005 but which was rejected by the former Taiwanese president. Ma has indicated he would accept the pandas.</p>",
  "<p>Jackie Ashley has rightly suggested that the government's reputation not just on the environment but also on its relationship to big business will largely be set by the decision on Heathrow expansion (The planet is the big loser in Brown's economic assault, November 3). </p> <p>There is another factor to be taken into consideration in deciding whether a third runway goes ahead. On the government's own calculations, if a third runway and sixth terminal are constructed, at least 1,000 people will be forcibly removed from their homes. On past government assessments, anything between 5,000 to 10,000 people could have their homes demolished or rendered unliveable by air pollution. This would be the largest forcible removal of a community in this country since the highland clearances.

  "<p>A year into the Katine project, is it on course to make a significant and lasting change for the people of the area? It is impossible to answer that question without a much better knowledge of the context than is possible from reading some technical documents and the odd blog, but the debate about what progress is being made in Katine makes interesting reading and brings out, among other things, one of the main tensions in development work in 2008. For all the talk of empowerment, for all the emphasis on ownership, what kind of impacts are we really measuring?</p> <p>We live in the age of tiered objectives, expected outcomes, lead and lag indicators, measurable impacts, which are all well and good \u2013 when used sensibly these methodologies can lead to the kind of critical thinking so vital in this era of development. But we also know from studying the history of development that the things most easily measured (education enrolment, water quality, income) are not necessarily the best indicators of real change. That's why you can't speak to a development professional for more than 30 seconds before the word \"empowerment\" pops out. It is recognition that even more important than the material benefits a development project might bestow, are the less tangible changes in capacity and confidence that make a community more resilient in the face of difficult circumstances, and more able to demand and defend its rights.</p> <p>So empowerment is the buzzword, but what is actually being measured by aid givers? What do the donors want to see in their annual reports? In two years time, at the end of the project, when the evaluators return with their long lists and clipboards, what signs will they be looking for that progress has been made?</p> <p>Amref's programme in Katine has five prongs: water, health, education, livelihoods and governance. Progress on the first four of those prongs will be relatively easy for evaluators to measure and quite rewarding for journalists to photograph. Success will look like schools newly stocked with materials, better trained and equipped health professionals and new farming techniques being employed. All these things, and others, will demonstrate change for many people, a real change in living standards, a change for the better. But will they mean a change for good?</p> <p>There are urgent needs in Katine, as in the rest of Africa, which require an urgent humanitarian response. But a humanitarian response is not development. Development is not just change, it is sustained change. Development is not just new books, new drugs, new wells. It is the confidence that when the outsiders have left, when the development experts are working with a different community, when the donors have refused repeat funding because of the global financial meltdown, when the journalists are covering a different story, change remains.<br> The last of the programme's five prongs, governance, is the most important, and the one least given to glossy photos. It is clear that Amref understands and emphasises the importance of governance, of empowerment, of processes. What is not yet clear is how the organisation's philosophy of empowerment will bear up when the pressure to produce \"results\" kicks in. As the end of the third year approaches, there will be underspends and phone calls from the finance department: \"We have targets to meet; what will the donors think?\" Meanwhile, journalists and the public at large will want change that can be photographed: greener fields, clean school uniforms, healthy looking faces. It is hard to photograph empowerment. It is hard to monitor growing confidence. But it can be done. Not by independent evaluators dropping in for a week, but by the project workers themselves, by the Amref staff who have built relationships with the communities and who can monitor progress over time. Only with this labour intensive type of accompaniment can real progress be measured, progress that depends on poor and marginalised communities taking power in their own hands, through better organisation, better education and a more strategic vision for their future.</p> <p>Some people think organisation and empowerment are a means to an end. That is more or less the conventional wisdom. When a community is \"empowered\" it can better reach its real goals, which relate to material benefits: better health, better food, better education, a higher income. But to turn conventional wisdom on its head for a moment, while being vital in themselves, in some ways health, education and income are only the means to the real end of development work: community strength and resilience, ready to face new challenges that come its way, long after the \"development project\" has moved on. <br> The Katine project is a bold initiative that will hopefully have a lasting impact on the target communities, and might even make a difference in Uganda as a whole. It has certainly generated a much needed debate about the role of aid and the state of development in Africa. Let's hope the project team sticks to its guns on empowerment and shows the watching world what development really means; not shiny results after just three years, but the gradual building of capacity and confidence. \u2022 Jonathan Glennie is the author of The Trouble With Aid, published by Zed Books</p>",

  "<p>Activity in Britain's manufacturing sector shrank for the sixth month in a row in October, with export orders falling to their lowest level since the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001, a survey showed yesterday.</p> <p>The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply said its index of manufacturing activity was 41.5 last month, slightly up from 41.2 in September. This was better than the forecast figure of 40 but still the second-weakest reading since the survey began in 1992. Any reading below 50 indicates a slowdown.</p> <p>The only bright spot was cost inflation rising at its slowest pace for more than three years, reflecting sharp drops in the price of oil and other commodities.</p> <p>\"Conditions for UK manufacturers remained brutal in October,\" said Roy Ayliffe of the CIPS. \"Purchasing managers have reported six consecutive months of decline, endorsing industry reports that the UK is now technically in recession.</p> <p>\"While weak domestic demand continued to severely hamper new business prospects, October also saw new export orders slump to levels last seen in the immediate aftermath of 9/11.\"</p> <p>Backlogs of work fell sharply, suggesting activity was being driven by firms clearing existing orders rather than working on new ones.

The organism, found in the Patagonian rainforest, naturally produces a mixture of chemicals that is remarkably similar to diesel. </p> <p>\"This is the only organism that has ever been shown to produce such an important combination of fuel substances,\" said Gary Strobel, a plant scientist from Montana State University, who led the work. \"We were totally surprised to learn that it was making a plethora of hydrocarbons.\"</p> <p>In principle, biofuels are attractive replacements for liquid fossil fuels used in transport that generate greenhouse gases. The European Union has set biofuel targets of 5.75% by 2010 and 10% by 2020. But critics say current biofuels scarcely reduce greenhouse gas emissions and cause food price rises and deforestation. Producing biofuels sustainably is now a target and this latest work has been greeted by experts as an encouraging step.</p> <p>The fungus, called Gliocladium roseum and discovered growing inside the ulmo tree (Eucryphia cordifolia) in northern Patagonia, produces a range of hydrocarbon molecules that are virtually identical to the fuel-grade compounds in existing fossil fuels. Details of the concoction, which Strobel calls \"mycodiesel\", will be published in the November issue of the journal Microbiology. \"The results were totally unexpected and very exciting and almost every hair on my arms stood on end,\" said Strobel.</p> <p>Many simple organisms, such as algae, are known to make chemicals that are similar to the hydrocarbons present in transport fuel but, according to Strobel, none produce the explosive high energy density found in this fungus. Strobel said that the chemical mixture produced could be used in a modern diesel engine without any modification. Another advantage of the fungus is its ability to eat up cellulose, the compound that makes up much of the organic waste that is currently discarded, such as stalks and sawdust. Converting this plant waste into fuels is an important goal for the biofuel industry, which currently uses food crops such as corn. </p> <p>\"Fungi are very important but we often overlook these organisms,\" said Tariq Butt, a fungus expert at Swansea University. \"The discovery and its potential applications are fantastic. However, more research is needed, as well as a pilot study to determine the costs and benefits.\" John Loughhead, executive director of the UK Energy Research Centre, also welcomed the \"encouraging\" discovery but noted it was at its earliest stage of development.</p>",
  "<p>Barclays has sent me a letter inviting me to \"treat\" myself to a Barclaycard Goldfish. What a nerve. The name Barclays has been poison to me ever since it allowed my mother's savings to shrink like a stabbed balloon, and blagged her into taking out a five-year bond in her 90s. Now it is hellbent on stuffing its executives with monster bonuses, even if it means borrowing squillions from the Gulf states at inflated interest; we are plunging into recession and on the brink of beggary, and here it is egging me on to spend more money. And it is not even my bank.</p> <p>So I read the Goldfish blurb carefully - about four pages of big print and numerous pages of teeny-weeny print, because perhaps I'm wrong. Perhaps there really is something worthwhile about this credit card, which offers \"unlimited rewards as you spend\". And 0% \"balance transfers\", but with 2.9% \"handling charge\" - 2.9% of what? I ring and ask. It's an 0844 line, so it's costing me 20p per minute, says the Goldfish person. While I'm at it, I ask what \"touch your card to the reader\" means. Apparently it means that if you want fast service and wish to spend less than \u00a310, you just touch the thingy with your your card, no need for a pin number, and grab your coffee, snacks and the contents of convenience at top speed. And can any robber who snatches your card do it, too? No, answers the information person - probably 20 more pence while he thinks about it, then I ring off. </p> <p>Why waste more money when there is a page clarifying the terminology. \"'We', 'we' [sic] or 'us',' it explains, means Barclays Bank plc ... [and] \"'You' or 'you' [sic] means you, the individual ...\". Rosemary and I studied this for ages to work out whether it was gibberish or we were stupid. We often do this with documents, but found this section to be more or less total toss. </p> <p>Has Barclays no shame? Have any of the immensely rich any shame any more? Are they aware of the boiling hatred welling up in millions of breasts, and do they ever try talking to one of the ordinary people in the street? Because if they did, they'd find that you only have to mention bonuses, banks and greed to any passer-by, and they will each turn at once into Mount Krakatoa, pouring out molten fury. I know because I've conducted my own little survey, saying \"bonuses\" out loud to shoppers, cashiers, to people on buses, at the vets and doctor's, on my dog walkies, and the result is always the same: like pricking the tiniest hole in a big, swollen abscess - something nasty bursts out. </p> <p>Perhaps our government should tap into this rich vein of hatred and outrage, and make sure the bonuses really do end, the banks stop taking the piss, exorbitant executive pay is taxed at 99% and that Roger Jenkins, who brokered Barclays' Middle East funding deal, together with his wife in her mink poncho, will be crammed into the stocks, pelted with Goldfish cards and publicly shamed. If all that could happen before the next general election, then I predict a Labour landslide.</p> <p><strong>Boris Johnson is launching a scheme to get Londoners </strong>growing vegetables in 2,012 new places in time for the Olympics. What a heavenly idea. All unused spaces are to be used: wasteland, old railway yards, canal banks, school and hospital gardens, roadside verges and flat roofs. The roofs alone would add up to 24 Richmond parks. And help will be available. Roof owners will be provided with tools and compost. Marvellous. Imagine the transformation: no more scrubby bits of ground spattered with weeds and rubbish, no sea of concrete - just sprouts, tomatoes, beans and carrots as far as the eye can see. It'll be just like the Dig for Victory campaign in the second world war, with the population cooperating for the common good. </p> <p>It's a noble aim. But isn't it a bit late? I feel rather bitter about this plan, thinking of all the lovely green bits that have gone: the bulldozed hospitals such as Friern Barnet and Athlone House in their acres of grounds, all sold and turned into poncey new homes; the school playing fields flogged off for more flats and offices; the extensive prison gardens barely ever used, while the prisoners rot indoors, banged up 22 hours a day; the endless acres of front gardens all paved over to park the cars because it costs too much to park on the roads, or because no one can be fagged with a front garden; and worst of all, those lovely Manor Garden allotments which were flattened to make way for the dreary Olympic site. The plot-holders begged to be allowed to stay and produce food for the athletes - just what Boris is dreaming of - but the brutish London Development Agency wouldn't hear of it. </p> <p>Now those gardeners are stuck in a waterlogged dump in Waltham Forest, where they can hardly grow anything. </p> <p>But let's not be negative. Perhaps Boris will succeed and turn London into a sustainable city, because it needs to be. Without imports, London would run out of food in three days, and then what will we do with all those athletes? So I hope that Boris, backed by Sustain, will bring those allotments back, green all the flat roofs and revive all the wasted spaces, so that the atmosphere and the view will improve, risk of flooding will be reduced, street markets will be bursting with home-grown local products, hospitals and prisons will feed themselves, and children will join in and learn that chips come from potatoes. I hope that Boris's dream comes true, and if it does I will vote for him over and over again.

  "<p>When copies of The Great Crash: 1929 by JK Galbraith were on their way back from the printer in 1955, its author was giving evidence to a Senate hearing - during which there was a sudden stockmarket crash. He was blamed for it. </p> <p>Galbraith wasn't a market maker or breaker. His book just made a simple point, repeatedly: that among financiers a sense of responsibility for the system they are part of is not just low, but virtually non-existent. Hence the permanent need for strong regulation.</p> <p>Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, clearly wasn't listening because his recent words appear forlorn, almost childishly naive: \"I made a mistake,\" he said, \"in presuming that the self-interests of organisations, specifically banks and others, were such that they were best capable of protecting their own shareholders and their equity in the firms.\" </p> <p>Yesterday Alistair Darling, Adair Turner and Mervyn King were all hauled before the Treasury select committee to answer for the handling of the crisis. Darling, the chancellor, and King, the governor of the Bank of England, do have much to answer for (Turner being too new as head of the Financial Services Authority). But were they even asked the right questions?</p> <p>Greenspan has admitted there was a flaw in the Anglo-Saxon economic model, the \"critical functioning structure\" of how the world works - the equivalent in 1989 of Gorbachev confronted by the fall of the Berlin Wall. But however brazenly bank executives keep manoeuvring to preserve their pay packages, the bonuses will bounce like dead cats - because the old economy can't bounce back. Its two key sources of fuel - credit and oil - are drying up, or were never really there in the first place.</p> <p>For decades, the mainstream dismissed the environmental movement as a \"bunch of Cassandras\", unaware that Cassandra's lethal paradox was to be right, but to be cursed to be disbelieved. Now the gods themselves admit that peak oil is imminent. In a report entitled the Medium Term Oil Market, the International Energy Agency - an official adviser to most of the major economic powers - said there will be \"a narrowing of spare capacity to minimal levels by 2013\". Next week it is expected to announce an even worse prognosis. </p> <p>The real question for Darling, King and Turner is: how do they re-engineer a wealthy, advanced economy in a few short years, and in the face of an unprecedented triple crunch? The interaction of the credit crisis, the imminent peak and decline of oil production, and a potentially uncontrollable phase of global warming in less than a hundred months represents an unprecedentedly volatile cocktail.</p> <p>This has been finance-driven capitalism's 1989. Centralised, remote, based on statistical fantasies and with poor feedback systems, both of these old systems were more alike than many want to admit. If we can raise the curse of Cassandra, Gordon Brown and Darling might like to see the New Economics Foundation's response to the prime minister's challenge for \"fresh and innovative intervention\". We propose 20 first steps to lay the foundations for a new economy. These introduce new measures of real value; better checks and balances on banks; innovations in local financial services to serve productive, interdependent local economies; and job-creating measures for massive environmental transformation.

  "<p>The billionaire property developer Donald Trump has won permission to build \"the world's greatest golf course\", complete with high-rise timeshare flats and eight-storey hotel, on a rare and ecologically sensitive stretch of dunes overlooking the North Sea.</p> <p>The New York-based businessman said he was \"greatly honoured\" after Scottish ministers in Edinburgh confirmed that his dream of creating one of golf's most northerly resorts had been approved, despite vociferous opposition from environmentalists and many local residents.</p> <p>His most famous opponent, Michael Forbes, the fisherman and quarry worker who earned abuse from Trump last year after refusing repeatedly to sell his home, which is on the land, still intends to stay put. \"They reckon the construction will last 10 years, but I'll never ever sell to that loudmouth bully,\" Forbes said last night.</p> <p>The \u00a31bn coastal resort north of Aberdeen, which covers 2,000 acres (809 hectares), is to have two 18-hole championship courses, four blocks of 950 timeshare flats, 500 \"exclusive\" homes, 36 villas, a golf academy, and housing for 400 staff. There will also be a coast road, named Trump Boulevard.</p> <p>Yesterday's outline planning approval legally binds Trump to agree to environmental checks and controls giving Aberdeenshire council and the Scottish government's environment agency, Scottish Natural Heritage, oversight to ensure the remaining wildlife is protected. </p> <p>Trump will be also required to build a 225-pupil primary school, shops, 98 low-cost houses and 50 starter homes (on land provided free by the council) in return for the 500-home estate, chalets and timeshares that will fund the development.</p> <p>The decision was welcomed by the local constituency MSP, the first minister and leader of the Scottish National party, Alex Salmond, and numerous business and tourism groups which regard it as a boost to the regional economy.</p> <p>Salmond, whose party faces a crucial byelection on Thursday in Glenrothes, Fife, said he had not influenced the decision. \"In tough economic times, substantial investment of this kind is at a premium - 6,000 jobs, including 1,400 which will be local and permanent, is a powerful argument. It is entirely right and proper that the resources of the country are harnessed to boost one of our great industries, and tourism is a great Scottish industry.\"</p> <p>Trump said: \"It will be a tremendous asset and source of pride for both Aberdeenshire and Scotland for many generations ... because of the quality of the land we are given to work with, we will build the greatest golf course in the world.\"</p> <p>Conservationists were furious when ministers agreed to override legal protection for part of the Foveran links, a legally protected system of naturally shifting sand dunes. It is designated a site of special scientific interest under EU legislation - but it is also central to Trump's vision. The plan is for the \"back nine\" holes of the main 18-hole course to be built over about a 10th of the dunes, despite the protests from Trump's own ecologists and Scottish Natural Heritage that this is unnecessarily destructive. Trump has refused to move that section of the course, and overruled his own environmental experts, telling the planning inquiry in June that he didn't do \"half-assed\" - it had to be all or nothing, he told the inspectors. The inspectors ruled that the damage to the dunes was outweighed by the resort's substantial value to the economy.</p> <p>This judgment was challenged by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. \"It appears that the desires of one high-profile overseas developer, who refused to compromise one inch, have been allowed to override the legal protection of this important site,\" said Aedan Smith, RSPB Scotland's head of planning. </p> <p>Martin Ford, the Liberal Democrat councillor whose casting vote against the development forced Scottish ministers to call in the plans, said: \"This is a very, very, bad precedent indeed and sends out a bad message about the protection in Scotland of our natural heritage sites. It appears to me to be a vanity project. I don't think we can claim this is a nationally important development, and it certainly did not need to be built on this site.\"</p> <p>Critics of Trump's proposals, which also breach Aberdeenshire's local development plan with house construction on the green belt, believe ministers have been overawed by the tycoon's reputation. </p> <p>Trump, owner of the Miss World beauty pageants, has been told he can only begin building the high-rise timeshare blocks - dubbed \"the Benidorms\" by angry residents - in stages, after some of the affordable homes are finished. He must also ensure, under Scotland's strict right to roam laws - rules he was unaware of until questioned by the Ramblers Association at the planning inquiry - that visitors still have unimpeded access to the dunes.</p> <h2>'I'll never, ever sell to him'</h2> <p>It is the ramshackle eyesore standing in the way of Donald Trump's great dream: a 23-acre spread of rambling farm buildings and rusting tractors sitting beside the future site of the world's greatest golf course. But despite offers as high as \u00a3450,000 from Trump for their home at Mill of Menie, and now the threat of living in a \u00a31bn construction site, Michael Forbes and his wife Sheila are refusing to sell. </p> <p>\"They reckon the construction will last 10 years, but I'll never, ever sell to that loudmouth bully,\" Forbes said last night. </p> <p>\"As I said before, I would rather give my land away to travelling people than sell to Trump, if it comes to that.\"</p> <p>Yesterday's decision by Scottish ministers to approve Trump's resort made him feel \"sick\", he added. Once a Scottish National party voter, he would never be one again. \"I used to be proud to be a Scotsman, but I'm going to take both of my kilts out and burn them after this,\" he said.</p> <p>Forbes, a salmon fisherman and quarryman, shot to global fame last October - echoing the film Local Hero, in which an elderly beachcomber blocks Burt Lancaster's planned refinery - after Trump branded his land \"disgusting\". </p> <p>Trump claimed Forbes's land was in \"total disrepair ... Rusty tractors, rusty oil cans - I actually asked him, 'Are you doing this on purpose to try and make it look bad, so I have to pay some more money?'\"</p> <p>Forbes said Trump would just have to build around him now. \"His biggest mistake was having a rant about me and calling me names on the TV,\" he said.</p>"
