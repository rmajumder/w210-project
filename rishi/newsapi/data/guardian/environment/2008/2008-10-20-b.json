  "<p>China has fuelled fears over a global recession by warning that the financial crisis is damaging its economic growth.</p> <p>Data released yesterday showed that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/china\">China</a>'s gross domestic product expanded by 9% in the third quarter of 2008, down from 10.1% for the second quarter. Although this is still extremely healthy compared with other major economies, it is less than the figure expected by experts - and the first time the country's GDP growth has dipped below 10% in almost three years.</p> <p>China's government blamed lower growth on the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/globaleconomy\">world economic slowdown</a>, which means less demand for Chinese exports. \"The growth rate of the world economy has slowed down noticeably. There are more uncertain and volatile factors in the international economic climate,\" said Li Xiaochao of China's National Bureau of Statistics. \"All these factors have started to release their negative impact on China's economy.\"</p> <p>After years of boom, China's GDP growth has now slowed for the last five consecutive quarters. The country is a huge consumer of raw materials, and last week the global mining giant Rio Tinto caused share prices in the sector to slump by warning that demand from China was slowing. Analysts believe that GDP growth will slow further in the fourth quarter, as the impact of the financial crisis bites.</p> <p>Huainan Zhao, a banking expert at the Cass Business School, in London, said: \"The problem is that China's economic growth is slowing down when it is most needed. But I am afraid that the world will have to live with a slowing Chinese economy. The IMF forecasted that the Chinese GDP will decline from 12% last year to about 9.6% this year.\" One of the most worrying aspects for the Chinese leadership is that net exports contributed only 1.2 percentage points to the country's total GDP growth over the last nine months, down from 2.4 percentage points over the same period of 2007.</p> <p>China's toymaking industry is under particular pressure, following a series of safety scares relating to manufacturing processes last year. Last week more than 6,000 employees lost their jobs when Smart Union, a major toy manufacturer in Dongguan, closed. It blamed a fall in demand from the US. </p> <p>Since President Hu Jintao took charge in 2004 with a mission to correct the imbalances that have accumulated throughout China's economy since the market reform process began in 1978, senior leaders have talked about boosting domestic consumption by raising incomes and improving social services, but growth has remained thoroughly export-led.</p> <p>Already forced to yield to international pressure to revalue its currency and make its goods more expensive overseas, China is now facing a significant slump in demand as the recession hits its markets in Europe and America. A back-up plan has become more urgent than ever. </p> <p>Last week, China's senior Communist party leaders approved plans to strengthen the rural economy and improve the incomes of farmers, hoping that making citizens better off will create a new market for the millions of computers and household appliances now being shipped abroad. For now, the measures appear to be too little, too late.</p> <p>Stock markets across Asia recorded gains overnight - after a week of volatility - as traders welcomed a $130bn (\u00a374bn) bail-out of South Korea's banking sector. The government in Seoul announced it would support its banks with $30bn of fresh liquidity and loan guarantees totalling $100bn.</p> <p>The move came just days after ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's put the country's five biggest banks on a ratings watch. S&amp;P warned that they could struggle to repay foreign loans, as the South Korean currency, the won, has fallen by a third against other currencies since January.</p> <p>Before the data's release, government leaders met to map out a strategy for countering the slowdown. Newspapers carried reports of planned measures to spur lending and stabilise the country's volatile financial markets. Share prices, for example, are still down nearly 70% from the peak they hit a year ago. </p> <p>In China, Li Xiaochao said that a range of measures - including export tax relief - will be introduced in the next few months to ease the pain. </p> <p>A rescue plan for the real estate sector is also in the works. The Beijing leadership has also vowed to spend more on welfare and construction, such as rebuilding the areas devastated by the earthquake in Sichuan province in May.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338820641\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2008/10/20/21.10.08.China.exports.gif\" alt=\"China exports\" width=\"462\" height=\"432\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>",
  "<p>British writers were yesterday coming to terms with the death of the doyenne of the London literary scene, Pat Kavanagh, paying tribute to her strength of spirit, tenacity and straight-talking.</p> <p>Kavanagh, 68, who was married to the novelist Julian Barnes, was at the summit of her profession, representing writers including Ruth Rendell, Margaret Drabble, Robert Harris, Joanna Trollope, Andrew Motion, Clive James, and Wendy Cope. What the writers had in common was their fierce loyalty to their agent, who died yesterday morning from a brain tumour.</p> <p>The novelist Robert Harris - a client for 27 years - said everyone was reeling from her loss. \"She was fantastically efficient and just the person you wanted to have represent you. There was no one quite like her really. And she was exotic, like a bird of paradise. She was unflappable and she didn't let you get above yourself. </p> <p>\"She always described herself as being like a family doctor or a country solicitor. She didn't believe in trying to screw an enormous amount of money out of publishers. Pat was always quite indiscreet and very funny and you know, in a world full of bullshit, there was no bullshit from Pat. She didn't suck up to her writers.\"</p> <p>For Kavanagh, the last year had been dominated by dispute. She led a walkout of 29 agents from what was once the UK's pre-eminent literary and entertainment agency, Peters, Fraser and Dunlop, and helped set up a rival, United Agents. It was a measure of the esteem she was held in that all her clients went with her.</p> <p>The dispute has its origins in the sale of PFD, in 2001, to CSS Stellar, a global sports and entertainment marketing group. When Kavanagh led a \u00a34m attempt to buy back PFD she was rebuffed, sparking her decision to set up United Agents. There is no suggestion that her illness had anything to do with the agency battles. But Harris said: \"Her last year was very much clouded by this terrible dispute. She took it hard, harder than any of us realised.\"</p> <p>Fellow client and novelist Blake Morrison said there was never any question that the writers would not stick by Kavanagh's side. \"She was the finest agent of her generation. If you look at who she represented, it's a pretty impressive list. There's a reason for that - she was completely trustworthy and when you sent her a typescript she would always let you know what she thought in no uncertain terms. She had complete integrity. There was a period in the 90s where there were these big advances and along came the new agents luring people away with promises of megabucks. Pat would absolutely do her best for her clients but she knew publishers' pockets aren't infinite. Both publishers and authors had enormous respect for her.\"</p> <p>Some have compared her to Peggy Ramsay, a similarly no-nonsense agent who represented many of Britain's leading playwrights in the 1950s and 1960s. And she has a place in real fiction, with Jeanette Winterson basing her 1992 novel, Written On The Body, on her affair with Kavanagh.</p> <p>Morrison said the split with PFD was \"a very unpleasant business\". He added: \"She had the values of an earlier generation. People like Kingsley Amis loved Pat. She was old school but she never seemed jaded. We all thought she would always be there, that she would never retire.\"</p> <p>Kavanagh was also, for 23 years, the agent of Martin Amis until he switched in 1995 to an agent known as the Jackal, Andrew Wylie. Kavanagh's husband Barnes ended his friendship with Amis. </p> <p>The writer Hermione Lee said: \"Pat Kavanagh was my friend and agent and to say the word 'was' in speaking of her is very hard for me to do.\" Lee said she loved and admired Kavanagh for \"her refusal ever to be false or gushing. She was a distinguished human being and the world is a lesser place without her.\"</p> <p>The short story writer Helen Simpson, who was among many visitors to Kavanagh's home yesterday, said she was still in shock. \"Pat managed to combine complete professionalism with that rare quality of never saying anything she didn't mean. As an agent she was unbeatable.\"</p>",
  "<p>It was on a family holiday to the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida that the new science minister, Lord Drayson, really understood the power that astronauts have to inspire. \"The tour guide asked all the children aged between eight and 15 to put their hands up. She said that they were eligible to join the Nasa astronaut programme to fly to Mars,\" he says. His five kids were captivated. \"Now my 11-year-old daughter wants to be an astronaut.\"</p> <p>Despite the British government's decades-long objection to funding human spaceflight, Drayson is now convinced of the value of a UK astronaut programme. And as the Guardian first revealed shortly after Gordon Brown's October 4 cabinet reshuffle, Paul Drayson intends to reverse that ban.</p> <p>\"When I was a young boy, I was inspired by those great science projects. In 1969, when men first landed on the moon, I was nine. It was fantastic the first time Concord flew. Those things made a big difference to me, they made me want to be involved in science and technology,\" says Drayson, who is also a top-flight racing driver. \"The government is going through a review at the moment of our space policy and I don't want to pre-judge that review. [But] iconic projects are part of the key to [inspiring young people] and so I want to make sure that in this review that value is fully taken into account.\"</p> <p>Drayson is a highly unusual figure in politics. He took the prime minister's call inviting him into government while on a race track in Atlanta, where he was preparing to compete in the latest leg of the American Le Mans series in his biofuel-driven Aston Martin - numbered 007. The life peer has been in government before as defence procurement minister, but he quit to pursue his dream of competing in the Le Mans 24-hour race in June next year. With the whine of race cars travelling at up to 200mph in the background, Brown agreed that Drayson could continue his racing career as long as it did not interfere with his ministerial responsibilities. Brown has upgraded the science minister post to a cabinet position and given Drayson the chairmanship of a cabinet committee on science and innovation. Drayson will also sit on the new National Economic Council.</p> <p><strong>City rocket scientists</strong></p> <p>That will give him more influence over economic decision-making than previous science ministers, but Drayson says the financial crisis and the loss of banking jobs from the City would offer opportunities as well as threats. \"When I was running a biotechnology company, I kept on losing some of my best scientists to the City, attracted by the better pay,\" says Drayson. \"With the turmoil that we've seen lately, now is a great time for people who have been trained in science to come back to science, whether it is to start up a science-based business or to come and teach science. If I was a City rocket scientist, now is the time to come back and do some real rocket science.\"</p> <p>He says one of his priorities will be tackling global warming. \"I believe that climate change is probably the most important challenge this generation faces. It's not a political fashion ... It is what the people want. Science clearly tells us that we have a major problem. The clock is ticking. We need to get on with it,\" he says. Drayson's race car runs on cellulosic bioethanol, a fuel that is not derived from crop plants, so circumventing the arguments about food versus fuel. But his family car collection reportedly includes two Aston Martins and a Lotus Elan, and he has no plans to have a government-issue, low-emission Toyota Prius.</p> <p>Drayson - whose full title is Baron Drayson of Kensington in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea - grew up near Brands Hatch race track and is a self-confessed \"car nut\". After maths, chemistry and physics A-levels, he studied engineering at Aston University (\"I really wanted to make things\") before continuing to complete a PhD in robotics there in 1985. \"For the first time in my life I was my own boss. I discovered that I loved that feeling,\" he says.</p> <p>He loved it so much that he left research to become a science entrepreneur. In 1993, he co-founded the hugely successful company Powderject Pharmaceuticals, which became the sixth largest vaccine-producing company in the world, with annual profits of \u00a325m. His business interests have netted Drayson a multimillion-pound fortune. He owns a house in London and a mansion (called Nether Lypiatt) in Gloucestershire that he reportedly bought for \u00a35.75m from Prince Michael of Kent. Drayson has used some of his wealth to pursue political goals. He has given more than \u00a3500,000 to the Labour party, sparking accusations that the donations were linked to the peerage Tony Blair granted him in 2004 and a \u00a332m government vaccine contract that Powderject won in 2002. Two inquiries cleared ministers and the company of any wrongdoing, and Drayson denies any allegation of sleaze.</p> <p>\"I think it is a public duty, actually, to support a political party,\" he says. \"I happen to believe that the values of the Labour party in terms of fairness and equality of opportunity are as relevant now in the 21st century as they've ever been.\" He says he will not make any donations to the party while he is a minister.</p> <p>Drayson says the post of science minister is his \"dream job in government\". In this respect he is more in the mould of the long-standing science minister Lord Sainsbury, who quit in 2004, than the two ministers who followed him, Malcolm Wicks and Dr Ian Pearson. Both hardly had time to get their feet under the desk and always looked as if they were on their way to another post. Phil Willis, a Liberal Democrat MP who chairs the House of Commons innovation, universities and skills select committee, says he could not see either Wicks or Pearson referring to the position as their \"dream job\".</p> <p><strong>Love of science</strong></p> <p>\"What excites me about Lord Drayson's appointment is that here is a minister who quite frankly does not have to be here,\" says Willis. \"He's taken this post because he loves science and he loves the translation of science into wealth creation. Since the days of Lord Sainsbury we've missed having a real heavyweight battling for science within government, and I think that has had a negative effect.\"</p> <p>Drayson's coat of arms is the only one in the House of Lords to include a DNA double helix and his family motto is \"seek knowledge\". Willis says that Drayson's passion for the subject stands out. \"He's an enthusiast. And the government is full of technocrats who don't have a vision, who don't have a passion for their briefs.\"</p> <p>Not surprisingly, the private sector is ecstatic at his appointment. \"Now more than ever, having someone with a proven track record in both the business and scientific communities will be of the utmost importance ... It is essential the UK fully exploits its scientific base to ensure that it remains internationally competitive,\" said a spokesperson for the British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association. But academic scientists might feel nervous that blue-skies research will be cut in favour of more applied projects. Drayson rejects this. \"I'm going to be vigorously defending pure science,\" he says.</p> <p>Willis is not concerned that pure research will suffer. \"I don't have that worry. Remember that he also comes from the research science background himself. I think he understands full well that unless you actually generate the world-class, blue-skies science, you will not have anything to translate.\"</p> <p><strong>Curriculum vitae</strong></p> <p><strong>Age: </strong>48</p> <p><strong>Job: </strong>Science minister</p> <p><strong>Before that:</strong> Racing driver, defence procurement minister</p> <p><strong>Likes:</strong> racing cars, science, space flight, the Labour party</p> <p><strong>Married</strong> with five children</p>",
  "<p>When I was 10 years old, my father took me down the Grimethorpe colliery and said, \"Do you want to spend your life working down the mine like me?\"</p> <p>\"Nay, father,\" I replied.</p> <p>\"Then get your head out your arse and start putting it up other people's.\"</p> <p>This is the story of a boy who did what he was told.</p> <p>I was born in 1935, in a mining village near Barnsley. My parents had no money - no one did in Yorkshire back in those days - and I can remember queuing for my weekly bath. So different from now, when all houses have hot and cold running water, but they were happy times, happy times.</p> <p>It's fair to say I didn't see eye-to-eye with the headmaster of my grammar school. He's dead now of course, and I left straight after taking my O-levels and got a job on the local paper. At the weekends I opened the batting with Dickie Bird, a wonderful, funny man, still alive I think, and together we emptied the ground - a feat I would consistently repeat throughout my television career.</p> <p>My agent, still alive thankfully, did warn the publishers that my story was actually very dull, but they said they didn't really care as long as I name-dropped a lot of celebrities. \"Does Robin Day, who sadly died a few years back, count?\" I asked. \"Because I met him when I was in Suez while doing my national service and he told me this wonderfully funny anecdote I've never forgotten about Lady Astor, who died a long time ago of course. Great times. Different, of course. But great nonetheless.\"</p> <p>I married Mary, who is still alive - we have kept the seven tonnes of coal my father gave us as a wedding present - and joined the Manchester Guardian in 1958 as the sheepdog trials correspondent. Some of the border collies I met back then are still close friends, though sadly many have passed on. I then became the celebrity interviewer for the Daily Express and it was there I developed my famously combative trademark style.</p> <p>\"So how did you become the most celebrated tea-dance pianist in Eastbourne?\" I asked the legendary 93-year-old Irene Sidebottom. \"Don't be so impertinent,\" she retorted icily. But she soon thawed and we eventually became close friends, before she sadly died of a heroin overdose last year at the marvellous old age of 143.</p> <p>This was the swinging 60s and, much to everyone's surprise, I became a well-known TV presenter and launched the careers of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, some of whom are still alive and some of whom have tragically passed away.</p> <p>But my obsession with celebrity really started when I met on a train a Miss World who would go on to marry Michael Caine - what a great actor, one of the all-time motion picture icons, still living - and was offered my own show on the BBC which ran for a staggering 237 years. </p> <p>People sometimes ask me who is the most remarkable person I've ever met apart from myself and I'm compelled to launch into paragraph after paragraph of unforgettable names. Muhammad Ali, Orson Welles, Marilyn Monroe, Frank Sinatra, William Shakespeare, WG Grace, George Best, Cheryl Cole, Michael Buble ... </p> <p>Which reminds me, I'll never forget the story Oliver Reed, who sadly drank himself to death some years back, told me about the time Fred Trueman bowled to Dame Edith Evans and Nelson Mandela with a ferret down his trousers, while Bing Crosby and Princess Anne sang the national anthem to Richard Burton, who also drank himself to death. Great memories.</p> <p>Not all my interviews went so well. Meg Ryan, who sadly isn't dead, still lingers in my mind. But that's television, and times change, I suppose, and I'm thankful to have had my career ended now that my hard-hitting, fire-side style is deemed to be out of date. I can't bear the kind of intrusive, \"Is there anything about you that is less than perfect?\" question that we're told the public wants these days. Besides, there are no real stars left any more. Did I mention the time Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon, marvellous, marvellous screen actors, giants of their era - although Lemmon is sadly dead now - hid in Billy Connolly's beard ... ?</p> <p><strong>The digested read, digested:</strong> The Emu had a point.</p>",
  "<p>Peter Mandelson, the secretary of state for business and enterprise, has been criticised by one of his predecessors, Patricia Hewitt, after he suggested that the government may try to ease the impact of the recession by delaying plans to extend rights to flexible working and better maternity leave. </p> <p>Mandelson floated the proposals as the government and the Conservatives offered competing packages to lessen the impact of the recession, including more government borrowing, help for small businesses, and restraints on repossession for defaulting homeowners.</p> <p>Gordon Brown said his government's mission would be to \"bring the same focus and determination to the task of safeguarding jobs and homes and small businesses, as we have done to avert the threatened meltdown of financial systems\".</p> <p>The Department for Business had been due to extend the right to ask for flexible working from parents with children under six to parents with children up to 16. It said it was right to think again at a time of economic uncertainty.</p> <p>But Hewitt opposed the review, saying: \"I understand the need and desire of any new secretary of state to look at what is going on in their department, but I do not think people should see flexible working as a cost to business, and therefore something to be cut back on. It can be of real benefit to employers.\"</p> <p>She added: \"When it comes to flexible working, and people reducing their working hours, actually that can be a real help in times of economic downturn. It makes more sense for an employer to say to the employees 'would any of you like to reduce your working hours?' instead of thinking 'who am I going to make redundant?\"'</p> <p>The review was welcomed by the CBI, but the TUC general secretary, Brendan Barber, said: \"Postponing a simple right to request flexible working would not save a single job in the small business sector. If such a request harms the business, the owner can say no. This would be an astonishingly irrelevant response to the severe economic downturn that we face and, in addition, would run the risk of sending a message to working parents that the government is not on their side.\" </p> <p>The Treasury chief secretary, Yvette Cooper, also sounded lukewarm. Speaking on GMTV, she said: \"What Peter Mandelson has been doing is looking at a whole range of ways in which we can support small businesses, help them through what are very difficult times as a result of what's going on in the global economy. </p> <p>\"What we clearly can't do, however, is do that in a way which makes life more difficult for people who are working for businesses, people who are worried about their jobs, and people who need flexible working, people who need additional support at work.\"</p> <p>Cooper has instead been emphasising that banks should act with greater restraint before repossessing the homes of defaulting mortgage holders. The Council of Mortgage Lenders is predicting that repossessions will rise to 45,000 this year up from 26,000 last year. The government has been told to speed up payments to small businesses, but some small businesses also want an end to the government being given first claim on debt when a firm goes bankrupt. </p> <p>The Conservatives offered a small business package centring on a 1p cut in employers' national insurance for at least six months for any small business with fewer than five employees. Excluding the self-employed, there are 2.3 million workers in businesses with fewer than five employees. A small business with four employees and an annual wage bill of \u00a3150,000 would save more than \u00a3100 a month. </p> <p>The Tories are also proposing that businesses with less than 250 staff should be able to defer paying VAT for six months. The cost to the Treasury would be \u00a3225m, but the Tories claim this cost could be met from earlier Tory funding plans.</p>",
  "<p>The Crown Estate, holder of the Queen's property, has helped trigger a resurgence of interest for wind projects in the deep waters off Britain by promising to invest in projects at a time when schemes are struggling in the face of planning delays and other problems.</p> <p>The decision by the Crown Estate to pay up to half of all pre-construction development costs has brought a huge surge in applications for the latest round of licensing, with almost 100 companies wanting to build wind farms far into the North Sea.</p> <p>\"The Crown Estate offering to be a development partner takes away much of the cost and uncertainty with third-round projects, which is why we have seen so much interest in the latest licensing round,\" said Adam Bruce, chairman of the British Wind Energy Association, on the eve of its annual conference to be opened by Gordon Brown today.</p> <p>The organisation has also showed its willingness to be at the forefront of the battle against climate change recently by agreeing to buy the world's biggest wind turbine, the 7.5-megawatt Clipper Windpower MBE prototype, codenamed Project Britannia. The turbine, said to be powerful enough to provide power for 5,500 homes, is under construction in Blyth, Northumberland, and will be towed out and erected in the North Sea. </p> <p>Although deep-water projects are expensive, they could be far more efficient because they could utilise larger turbines and take advantage of stronger prevailing winds, said Bruce. \"Unlike onshore wind schemes, the operator is also only dealing with one planning regime and one landlord in the Crown Estate, which is now offering to be a partner.\"</p> <p>The organisation, which has responsibility for licensing the seabed up to 200 miles out for renewable projects, will help pay for the cost of undertaking studies on what impact plans would have on shipping and marine life. The cost of doing that will later be clawed back from revenues once the wind turbines are turning. </p> <p>Ninety-six companies expressed their interest by last month in becoming involved in the third licensing round, far more than in previous rounds. The Crown Estate is considering the offers and will make a firm decision on who will win the chance to proceed with schemes on 11 favoured zones.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Crown Estate said the response to the licensing round had \"greatly exceeded our expectations\". The body, which owns parts of Regent Street as well as 55% of Britain's foreshore, traces its history back to George III, who swapped much of his land for a fixed income from the Treasury. It is independent of the monarch and the government.</p> <p>The interest in deep-water projects is a welcome boost for the industry, which is still hobbled by problems that ministers have endlessly promised to sort out. </p> <p>A new planning bill is meant to streamline projects but the BWEA pointed out yesterday in a new review that half of the seven gigawatts of wind capacity stuck in the planning system is located in Scotland and not covered by the legislation and a further 3.5GW is represented by schemes below a 50-megawatt threshold.</p> <p>There are still difficulties with the ministry of defence and the aviation sector over the alleged threat to radar coverage posed by wind turbines. The government has again promised to bang heads together to prevent this delaying schemes but problems remain.</p> <p>\"It is currently not possible to quantify the risk to a project from an aviation perspective,\" says the BWEA. \"The objections cannot be easily predicted, and a pre-planning statement of no objection is not always valid through the planning process.\"</p> <p>The prime minister will reiterate his determination to clear any logjams and ensure wind farming reaches its potential. Brown will say that his decision to create a new self-standing energy and climate change department is proof of how seriously he takes global warming and energy security. </p> <p>The Carbon Trust will today announce that it has reached agreement with five major energy companies under which \u00a330m will be invested in finding ways to reduce the cost of offshore wind by at least 10%. </p> <p>Airtricity, ScottishPower Renewables and StatoilHydro will work with RWE Innogy and Dong Energy to research and develop ways of cutting costs and improving efficiency at wind farms at a time of mounting concern that rising costs are chasing investors away from renewables.</p> <p>The move comes only days after the Carbon Trust, an organisation established by government to help speed up the introduction of clean energy, published a report showing that the government would fail to meet its offshore-wind goals unless a variety of measures were introduced. Among the proposals was that permission be given to develop a new generation of wind farms much closer to shore.</p>",
  "<p>\"Ca c'est typique! Tu ne comprends pas qu'on vit dans une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de consommateurs?\" Pupils from Shawlands academy in Glasgow staged a play about the politics of conservation on an unused island in Pollok Park, an island they reclaimed themselves, wading out in welly boots to cut back the shrubbery and create a natural auditorium.</p> <p>The Litter Pickers, which featured an argument between Greek goddesses Aphrodite and Hestia - in French - won the school a language award, and was gamely performed alfresco despite skies that threatened rain.</p> <p>But as well as being a project that the school is proud of, The Litter Pickers typifies an approach to sustainability that tries to break down barriers between subjects and involve the whole school. That is the approach that has won the school this year's award for sustainable schools. The judges were impressed by a \"clear shared vision among pupils and staff\" on sustainability. \"The initiative has enriched teaching and learning across a wide range of curriculum areas,\" they said.</p> <p><strong>Rich cultural mix</strong></p> <p>Shawlands, an inner suburb on Glasgow's southside, is a mixed area. Its traditional tenements in red and blond sandstone are relatively sought after and it is sometimes called the \"new West End\". A lively up-and-coming area, it has a diverse population and more than 50 languages are spoken by the 1,200 pupils. The most culturally mixed in Scotland, around half of its pupils are from ethnic minorities.</p> <p>Within the school, many of the pupils themselves are concerned about the environment and dozens of them attend a thriving \"eco club\" that meets in a classroom at lunchtime.</p> <p>Arriving with their sandwiches and drinks, the students share their concerns about climate change and what they can do about it. Although they exhibit a high level of awareness, they seem cheerfully positive, feeling that they're doing what they can in their own back yard. Teachers say children coming in from primary school are increasingly used to thinking about the environment and want to do more.</p> <p>Hazel Anderson, 12, is one of the large number of first-years who have chosen to join the eco club. \"I think we have to do what we can to keep our world clean, because it is what future generations will inherit.\"</p> <p>\"I just think it is really important that we act now because climate change is obviously happening,\" says David Johnstone, 13, \"We need to try to combat it before it is too late. What we're doing in this club is recycling loads, and that must make a massive difference. If every school does what we're doing, I think it would make all the difference.\"</p> <p>Sixth-former Daniel Chisholm, 16, is one of just two founder members who started the club four years ago. \"I've seen a real difference in the school,\" he says. One of the biggest changes is in the careless dropping of litter at break and lunch times. \"When we first started doing this, the amount of litter that was getting dropped was unbelievable. It is quite tidy now, compared to what it was.\"</p> <p>The eco club was able to get funding from Clean Glasgow for handheld litterpickers and fluorescent jackets for volunteers, and one evening a week a group of them goes around the school and its environs picking up litter. </p> <p>The group has installed a recycling system and once a week children sort out the recycling boxes from every area of the school, and take the collected material to a central point. The school recycled over 885kg of paper and plastic bottles last year, as well as mobile phones and printer cartridges. Unwanted shoes are also recycled and donated to Africa.</p> <p>\"We are trying to save the world, bit by bit,\" says Tegan Westwater, 14, a committed member of the eco group who was chosen to visit Sweden last year to represent the school as part of a Clean Europe forum. An advert for recycling stands in the hall: a large statue known as Medusa, which the group made from recycled wood, metal and other refuse. The statue was temporarily moved to a nearby church hall last year where the school held an eco convention on sustainability attended by more than 1,000 people. </p> <p>The technology teacher, Grant Gellis, who helped with the statue, has also been part of a group that is in the process of creating a small herb and flower garden in a verge at the edge of the playground. Biology teacher Laura Bremner is already making use of it to study plants, and they hope that enough herbs might be grown in time to allow home economics students to flavour their cookery with them.</p> <p>The head, Ann Grant, is keen to build on the community's strengths in this area. \"There are a lot of young people in this school who are very committed to looking after the environment and to living in a more sustainable way. We're also trying to encourage them to look after the place and to look after the future.\"</p> <p><strong>Future plans</strong></p> <p>Grant plans to raise funding for solar panels and a wind turbine in the future to take them further in this direction - the building already has sensors on light fittings in the toilets to reduce electricity use. But Grant points to the head of the French department, Basia Gordon, as the real leader whose passionate commitment has set the ball rolling in this area. Gordon has worked indefatigably in many areas of the school's life to involve students in eco projects, including getting children involved in the bilingual support group to join eco club members in regular work sessions at Pollok Park, a large country park which until the extension of the M77 was the largest urban green space in Europe. As well as reclaiming the island, they have also planted 1,000 trees and do other voluntary work, clearing rubbish and \"bashing rhoddies\" (rhododendrons), which have taken over in places.</p> <p>Gordon says the benefit of encouraging the children with English as a second language to be part of volunteering was twofold. \"It is partly about them getting to know other children and find out what is going on in the school and outside it, but it also means they are learning English.\" </p> <p>\"We have come a long way in a short time. Four years ago, we only had two children in the eco group. Now there is a core group of 25 and a lot more who are involved in various things,\" says Gordon. For the past two years, the eco group has had an annual weekend away to an outdoor centre in the Cairngorms, where they have taken part in outdoor activities and learned more about the natural world. </p> <p>Clearly passionate about sustainability, Gordon is sincere about helping students to engage with these issues \"because this is the world they are going to inherit\". </p> <h2>DCSF award for sustainable schools</h2> <p><strong>Regional winners</strong></p> <p><strong>Beckington CE first school</strong> (West); <strong>St Francis Xavier Catholic school</strong> (West Midlands); <strong>St Christopher's school</strong> (Wales); <strong>Upton Cross primary</strong> (South-west); <strong>Brill CE combined school</strong> (South); <strong>Ringmer community college</strong> (South-east); <strong>Shawlands academy </strong>(Scotland); <strong>Woodheys primary</strong> (North-west); <strong>Meanwood CE primary</strong> (North); <strong>Tollgate primary</strong> (London); <strong>Crosshall junior </strong>(East); <strong>Eureka primary</strong> (East Midlands); <strong>St Paul's junior high </strong>(Northern Ireland)</p>",
  "<p>Tiny steps: that's the way. Today 15-year-old Max Nissim, supported by a harness, is making careful progress across the room. \"Good boy, that's the way. Good boy,\" encourages Anne Gough, winner of the special needs teacher of the year award.</p> <p>Persuading Max, who has limited hearing and sight, to leave his wheelchair and get on his feet is important; but what happens next is possibly even more important for a teenager with no speech. Gough hands Max a long yellow pole; he grips it and moves across the floor like a tightrope walker.</p> <p>When Max came to the Royal School for the Deaf and Communication Disorders in Cheadle Hulme, Greater Manchester, he held his hands permanently by his head. Now, if you will forgive the mixed metaphor, he is using his hands to take tiny steps that lead to a potential leap in his communication skills.</p> <p>\"We are doing a lot of therapy work to strengthen his shoulder muscles and develop his hand function,\" explains Gough, head of the school's sensory unit. Hence the yellow pole. \"We have encouraged him to use his hands to hold things, mouth them, work them out. And then he can begin to make choices, to reach for the things he wants. The longer-term aim is to develop some effective form of communication so that he can go through a bag and take out an object indicating something he would like.\"</p> <p>And so Max's fingers will help him be in touch with the world. The Royal School, founded by Manchester businessmen in 1823, used to teach only deaf children. Now its students often have a combination of hearing, visual, behaviour and learning disabilities, including autism. Their problems are some of the most severe the education system deals with.</p> <p>Gough joined the Royal School 14 years ago as a support assistant and moved on to teaching three years later after training to work with children with complex needs. \"I nominated her for the award because it's about time somebody did,\" says Lauren Haynes, who worked with Gough as a support assistant and then became a teacher herself. \"She is absolutely amazing in the way she works with colleagues, with other professionals, residents, parents, students themselves. She needs to be rewarded. And she needs to be cloned.\"</p> <p><strong>Unique ability</strong></p> <p>\"One runs out of superlatives after a while,\" adds Hilary Ward, the school's head. \"Anne has a unique ability to be able to get inside the heads of the youngsters. She can suss where they are at so that she can move them on to the next stage.\"</p> <p>The Teaching Awards judges reported that colleagues and parents describe Gough as \"a truly amazing human being\" and went on to discover for themselves that she is a gifted teacher who understands complex needs. \"Anne is constantly developing her expertise in order to meet the challenges of pupils,\" add the judges. \"She has an essential calming influence and ensures that everyone makes progress in their learning activities, even when this progress is against painstakingly small targets.\" It's those small steps again.</p> <p>Gough describes strategies that \"enable pupils to communicate and make some sense of a world that is incredibly difficult for them\". She trained first as a mainstream teacher but was always aware of the needs of her deaf brother, brought up at a time when deaf children were encouraged to speak rather than use sign language. Many children left school with no language so their literacy skills were very poor, and her brother and family suffered considerable frustration. \"I didn't want to see other children in that situation. So I think that inspired me to try to develop communication methods.\"</p> <p>At first she and other staff followed the national curriculum, teaching students in class groups while also trying to work on specific targets for each child. \"Students were in a classroom having lots of experiences thrown at them but not understanding what those experiences were. I felt very strongly that our starting point should be communication.</p> <p>\"And how can you teach communication unless someone is in a very interesting and exciting environment? If you are trying to teach a young child to speak, you don't talk about something really boring. You'll try to get them to communicate about what they want.\"</p> <p>Picking up on government moves in 2005 to allow a more personalised approach, Gough went to the head and suggested that each student should have his or her own tailormade learning programme. \"Instead of giving lessons adapted to meet individual needs, we went for a whole individual timetable based entirely on the student's needs.</p> <p>\"We would look initially at why the child wasn't communicating. Some of our children with more profound and multiple learning difficulties are not communicating because they have no means to do it. They don't have any functional control over their hands. They may have no vision, no hearing. So how do they communicate?\"</p> <p>The starting point, as with Max, is to help their physical development, give them some ability to have some intentional movement. </p> <p>Gough adds that the best way to encourage autistic children to communicate is to motivate them. \"Children who are autistic have no concept of what you are thinking, feeling. It's all about themselves. Once you know what motivates them, you can start to develop communication. We do that very simply through picture exchange or picture pointing.</p> <p>\"We take those children and put them in situations that are highly motivating, wait for the moment when they are so excited about something that they want to ask for it again. Then we show them the picture to help them request it again. We now have children who can tell us when they are hungry or in pain, and where it hurts.\"</p> <p><strong>Watch them smile</strong></p> <p>Still more tiny steps. It is, adds Gough, a fantastic feeling to help a child communicate effectively with his or her parents for the first time, to express what he or she wants. \"All these kids are amazing, really. You take a child who has very limited sensory awareness, as all our children have, and watch them every day and see them smile and get pleasure out of things. That's a kick for all of us. You have to keep moving and it's enthusiasm that drives you on. No book has been written about these children. There is no text book. So you are learning all the time, constantly trying something new. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.</p> <p>\"I think I'm thoroughly addicted. It's the best job on the planet.\" Ward ruefully concedes that the new individual approach \"costs us an arm and a leg because for every child we have to have a learning support assistant to deliver the programme\". But it works and, inspired by Gough, three assistants have gone on to become teachers - including Haynes.</p> <p>\"Anne always looks so content when she is working with the students,\" says Haynes. \"Her determination, motivation and passion just shine through.\"</p> <h2>Award for special needs teacher of the year </h2> <p><strong>Regional winners</strong></p> <p><strong>Gill Fletcher</strong>, Tile Hill Wood school and language college (West Midlands); <strong>Neil Purcell</strong>, High Street primary (Wales); <strong>John Davies</strong>, Combe Pafford school (South-west); <strong>Freya Newberry</strong>, Ringwood school (South); <strong>Phil Martin</strong>, Goldwyn community special school (South-east); <strong>Allison Murphy</strong>, Knockbreda primary (Northern Ireland); <strong>Anne Gough</strong>, Royal School for the Deaf and Communication Disorders (North-west); <strong>Lesley Elsdon</strong>, Raincliffe school (North); <strong>Judith Reed</strong>, West Jesmond primary (North-east &amp; Cumbria); <strong>Louise Dunton</strong>, The Harefield academy (London); <strong>Claire Asher</strong>, Anthony Curton primary (East); <strong>Neil Amos</strong>, Derrymount school (East Midlands)</p>",
  "<p>Inside the rainbow nurturing room at Woodlands primary in Birkenhead, the walls are covered with photographs of the children, busy at work and smiling. There's a large paper rainbow at the centre. \"Mrs Skillen gives me stickers,\" reads one of the messages in a child's handwriting. Cuddly toys are dotted around the room; Mozart is playing soothingly in the background. A large corner sofa is the focus of the room, by the school desks. The room is a haven of calm in what can be some troubled young lives.</p> <p>Gill Lindfield, the headteacher at Woodlands primary for six years, nominated Mandy Skillen for the teaching assistant of the year award. \"She is absolutely amazing,\" Lindfield says. \"I have never worked with anybody like her.\" She says Skillen's positive work has pervaded the whole school and has even won over the sceptics. Not only a teaching assistant and nurturer, she is a governor and is in charge of the lunchtime supervisors.</p> <p>\"She has been at the school for 20-odd years, she cares genuinely, is non-judgmental and wants the best for the children.\" Lindfield remembers one child who kicked off and wouldn't come to school. Skillen told him he could come to school in his pyjamas or uniform. \"He never did that again,\" Lindfield says. </p> <p>Skillen also has contacts with other agencies, including mental health teams who can work with the most vulnerable children. Parents and children know where she lives, and some children have even been known to visit her at home. Self-effacing, she was absolutely mortified to be nominated for the award and was overwhelmed by emotion.</p> <p>Her link with the school began when her five children, now aged 20 to 28, attended and she became involved in the PTA, of which she is still an active member. One of her daughters, Rachel, works at Woodlands. \"I don't think I realised how demanding the nurture class would be emotionally,\" Skillen admits. She had a child who, for six to eight months, would communicate only by standing at the opposite side of the room writing messages on a notepad or whiteboard because he didn't want to speak. \"In the end he would sit and talk to me, but it took a long time.\"</p> <p><strong>Touching lives</strong></p> <p>A parent told the judges: \"In life you meet people who are able to touch the hearts of others, who genuinely care and instil confidence and security with positive guidance, and yet seem totally unaware. Mrs Skillen is one of these people\".</p> <p>Another parent was facing homelessness and the very real prospect of her son being taken into care. But Skillen stored her belongings under the sandpit in the rainbow room and helped her to find a new home. Her son is now settled. \"He used to say [to Skillen]: 'I wish my Mum was like you,' she says. \"He calls me Mum now.\" She told the judges: \"Without her I would probably not be here and I would certainly not have my son with me.\"</p> <p>On a typical day, Skillen will have circle time, where the children pass around a pebble and talk about how they are feeling. Some children call in for a cup of tea and a biscuit and she says it is often amazing what they reveal to her. There are albums of photographs for the children to pore over. </p> <p>She says for some children it can be difficult when the summer or Christmas holidays are looming, as they love school so much and the support and stability it gives them: \"You should have seen the year 6 boys last summer, sat here sobbing their hearts out - really tough boys. One of my regular visitors asked me: 'How am I going to cope without you?'\"</p> <p>Skillen set up the nurture class in 2004 and at the time there were a number of children in danger of exclusion. In the past three years, however, no children have been permanently excluded.</p> <p>Woodlands is in the heart of one of the most socially and economically deprived areas in the UK. \"We have very high numbers of very vulnerable families,\" Lindfield says. \"There are a lot of very young families, private landlords and drugs issues, which cause a lot of stress for parents. \"Mandy goes and gets these kids from home if she needs to and removes one of the barriers to learning. It has made a huge difference. The fact that children are in school means the parents are more relaxed and they engage with us more.\"</p> <p>Wendy Sharples, a year 2 teacher, has noticed the difference Skillen has made. \"She tends to take children in year 1 and by the time they come to me they have the language and vocabulary to talk about what they are feeling. Whereas normally these children would become frustrated and make life difficult for everyone, they are now able to talk about how they are feeling. She gives them security and confidence so they are able to start learning.\"</p> <p>Sharples says children can sometimes slip back, but when they do they are able to deal with it because of the work her colleague has done with them. \"Mandy does circle time with them and they can talk about their worries, problems and fears. Sadly, we don't have time as teachers, with all the pressures and 30 children in a class.\" Skillen's ethos has permeated through the school and she has encouraged the dinner-time supervisors to adopt a nurturing attitude.</p> <p>A child whom she has helped says of Skillen: \"She is always helpful and when I have been upset she has always let me come and speak to her. My mum's boyfriend used to have arguments with her that made me scared and worried. I didn't like coming to school because I didn't like leaving her. Now I come here for a hug and I feel better and a lot happier.\"</p> <p>Tom, in year 4, says: \"She is really nice and always helps me with my anger. I used to get into fights in year 2 and I was always dead angry. I would hit people, kick them and call them names. Now I count up to 10 if I get angry and I don't get into fights. I get into trouble a bit, but not as much.\"</p> <p>Another girl, Nicole, says Skillen was helpful after her dad died. \"I would come and talk to her and she helped me do a book about him. When something goes wrong, she is always there straight away.\"</p> <h2>TDA award for teaching assistant of the year </h2> <p><strong>Regional winners</strong></p> <p><strong>Sally Tedd</strong>, Highbury primary (West); <strong>Carol Archer</strong>, Bridgetown primary (West Midlands); <strong>Andrea Davies</strong>, Ysgol y Llan, Whitford (Wales); <strong>Sarah Felgate</strong>, Orchard Vale community school (South-west); <strong>Marilyn West</strong>, Stocklake Park school (South); <strong>Lorraine Eyre-Walker</strong>, Hillside school (South-east); <strong>Jennifer Doyle</strong>, Hart Memorial primary (Northern Ireland); <strong>Mandy Skillen</strong>, Woodlands primary (North-west); <strong>Dawn Cooper-Noble</strong>, Saxton CE primary (North); <strong>Sarah Lawler</strong>, Churchill community college (North-east &amp; Cumbria); <strong>Diane Stanley</strong>, Brunswick Park school (London); <strong>Paula Wright</strong>, Henderson Green primary (East); <strong>Raine Hart</strong>, Glenbrook primary and foundation school (East Midlands)</p>",
  "<p>Three frightening guests and the ghost of a chicken were the supreme test of this year's primary teacher of the year - Libby Pryce, who has brought the title home to the former mining town of Mexborough in south Yorkshire.</p> <p>It was there that she survived, with major honours, a school assembly that was the stuff of nightmares, and not just because three Ofsted inspectors with clipboards were standing at the back of the hall.</p> <p>\"We'd raised a chick from an egg,\" remembers Pryce with the beginnings of a shudder, as this year's reception class giggle and scamper off to mums and dads waiting in the playground outside. \"It was part of a session we were doing on awe and wonder. We weighed and measured it every day and gave a report to assembly each time.\"</p> <p>Except on the fatal day, which naturally fell in the middle of Ofsted's inspection of Pitt Street infants' school. After an introductory song and some school announcements, it was \"chick time\", but Pryce's teaching assistant slipped on to the platform minus the usual ball of yellow fluff.</p> <p>\"She came up close and whispered in my ear: 'It's died',\" says Pryce. It was more than five years ago, but you can still see the impression this made. \"What did you do?\" \"I can't remember. I've blotted it out. But the Ofsted report gave a special mention to the 'sensitive way' tragic news was dealt with during an assembly that the inspectors had observed.\"</p> <p><strong>Magic and fun</strong></p> <p>The Pryce Dead Chicken Strategy may be forever a mystery, but the overall talents of the mother of three, developed over 37 years of teaching, are obvious when you squeeze into one of the tiny chairs and join her reception class. Magic, fun, the unexpected ... little hands shoot up all the time to answer questions, but the quiet and shy children get their share of attention, too. </p> <p>Twenty three small faces this year, and none are overlooked. Pryce's own face is also one of her teaching tools. Already, after only a fortnight, the new kids on Pitt Street's block know the repertoire of \"Mrs Pryce looks\". She picks children to answer a question, fetch equipment or take their turn to go at the end of the day with a raised eyebrow, a wink or a tilt of her head and a stare.</p> <p>She decided to be a teacher very early on, thanks to one of the team who taught her at a similar primary in Dinnington, another south Yorkshire mining community. He was always called \"Mr Outram\", and for Pryce remains so; now 58, she met him at her mum's local supermarket a year ago and was amazed that he not only recognised her, but asked after the whole of her primary cohort, name perfect after nearly half a century.</p> <p>\"Mr Outram turned my learning light on. He was a wonderful man,\" she says. \"We used to run to school to find out what he had for us. He made everything come alive, and he showed me how to value everybody. Everyone. That was the most important thing I took from him.\"</p> <p>Through teenage stints at nursery work and teacher training in Bradford, at the old Margaret McMillan college, named after another outstanding teacher, Pryce kept Mr Outram in mind. Then she put her own version of his methods into practice, first for six years at an infants' school in central Doncaster, then as a supply teacher while her daughter and two sons were young, and finally at Pitt Street. She mixed educational theory with commonsense lessons from her own boisterous family home. She was one of five, and her mother and father, who worked for the Coal Board like nearly everyone in Dinnington, encouraged them to fill the house with their friends.</p> <p>\"Lots of patience is the first thing you need as a teacher,\" she says, analysing how the theory, family memories and her own classroom experience at Dinnington work in practice in 2008. \"Side by side with that goes a good sense of humour. You've got to be prepared to laugh along the way - to really enjoy the children. </p> <p>\"Finally, and this develops with practice, I think that I know exactly where each child has got to. From that, you avoid expecting too little or too much. You also come to know instinctively, looking round the class, who you need to pull in to a session and who you need to calm down.\"</p> <p>Calming down is sometimes an unavoidable tactic in a Pryce class, where activities may include giving snails a bath, making a home for worms or visiting firefighters - and, just as important, their fire engine. But it isn't a case of suppressing the natural bubble of most five-year-olds.</p> <p>\"They're like young racehorses in the starting box,\" says Pryce, who loves this attribute and responds to it in kind. \"They're just raring to go.\" Changing analogy, she says that in terms of teaching, the children \"are like sponges ready to soak things up. The more you give them, the more they take in. You can't give them too much.\"</p> <p>Pryce is one of a team. That's the first thing she says. Pitt Street is small and friendly, built into a typical row of miners' terraced houses with the proud legend \"Mexborough School Board\" carved on its gable, although Doncaster is the local education authority now. </p> <p>Although her strengths in teaching reception were what dazzled the judges, her work as deputy head at Pitt Street was important to her citation, too. She has systemised the individual monitoring that she practises in class. Her profile evidence collecting at foundation stage is used as a model across Doncaster's infant schools.</p> <p>Pryce was nominated for the Teaching Awards by a newly qualified young colleague who has now moved on, but said this in her testimonial: \"She is exciting, motivating and just a fantastic mentor. I cannot put into words how fantastic she is.\"</p> <p><strong>Admiration in action</strong></p> <p>One of her classroom volunteers put his admiration into action rather than words. He volunteered to help when his grand-daughter joined reception 13 years ago. She's now 17 and long gone, but her granddad likes the bright, colourful world of Pitt Street reception class so much that he has no plans to leave. </p> <p>\"The team in this school is supportive and encouraging,\" says Pryce. \"But just as important, you learn a lot from them. We all expect a lot from one another, and so we all have to give it. My award is a team award.\"</p> <p>She has another supporting team: her husband heads the art department at a high school in nearby Doncaster; they met at 16, at school, and have encouraged one another throughout their careers. None of their three children have gone into education (\"They've had to share me with schools all their lives,\" says Pryce ruefully) but they've been rooting for her.</p> <p>So has her 86-year-old mum, back in Dinnington, and she's had a special job, too. She regularly sees Mr Outram about, and has kept him touch with the progress of his pupil. She'll be straight down to the supermarket, Pryce has no doubt, to tell him about the honour awarded to her daughter - and the way she has adopted and adapted his ideas.</p> <h2>BT award for teacher of the year in a primary school</h2> <p><strong>Regional winners</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Humphries</strong>, St John's CE primary (West); <strong>Josie Aallun</strong>, St Matthew's CE (A) primary (West Midlands); <strong>Karen Wathan</strong>, Pontlottyn primary (Wales); <strong>Olly White</strong>, Kentisbeare CE primary (South-west); <strong>Rob Gallop</strong>, St James' CE primary (South); <strong>Anna Davies</strong>, Drapers Mills primary (South-east); <strong>Ciara O'Neill</strong>, St Brigid's primary (Mayogall) (Northern Ireland); <strong>Nicola Garth</strong>, Watersheddings primary (North-west); <strong>Libby Pryce</strong>, Pitt Street infant school (North); <strong>Debbie Abbott</strong>, Portobello primary (North-east &amp; Cumbria); <strong>Karen Chappell</strong>, St Thomas CE primary (London); <strong>Caroline Nofer</strong>, Gorefield primary (East); <strong>Beth Darby</strong>, White's Wood Lane junior school (East Midlands).</p>",
  "<p>Max Mosley will today seek to inject a dose of commercial reality into what he regards as the unnecessarily profligate formula one business when he meets the team principals in Geneva. He hopes to hammer out a package of cost-cutting measures to save the sport's long-term future. </p> <p>The FIA president believes that formula one costs are unsustainable in the long term and that the sport can no longer shy away from making significant savings. Only by doing so, he feels, can the sport's credibility be maintained and the spectre of poorer teams being priced out of the business dispelled. </p> <p>\"The FIA believes that formula one costs are unsustainable,\" he wrote last week in a letter to the team principals. \"Even before current global financial problems, teams were spending far more than their incomes, insofar as these consist of sponsorship plus FOM money [the commercial-rights income from the sport, controlled by Bernie Ecclestone's Formula One Management organisation].</p> <p>\"As a result, the independ-ent teams are now dependent on the goodwill of rich individuals while the manufacturers' teams depend on massive hand-outs from their parent companies.\" </p> <p>Mosley's view is that unless the teams can be kept in business by their share of the $1bn annual commercial-rights income, which includes television revenue and appearance money, the sport's future will be precarious. Relying on the largesse of billionaires such as the Red Bull energy-drink founder, Dietrich Mateschitz, who controls Red Bull Racing and its sister team Scuderia Toro Rosso, and Vijay Mallya, who owns the Force India squad, does not represent a long-term solution. </p> <p>\"There is now a real danger that in some cases these subsidies will cease,\" he said. \"This could result in a reduction in the number of competitors, adding to the two team vacancies we already have and reducing the grid to an unacceptable level. The FIA's view is that formula one can only be healthy if a team can race competitively for a budget at, or very close to, what it gets from FOM.\" </p> <p>Current rules provide for up to 26 cars on the grid in the form of 13 two-car teams.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/englandrugbyleagueteam\">England's</a> captain, Jamie Peacock, managed to slip references to the global credit crunch and space exploration into his assessment of the upcoming <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/rugbyleagueworldcup2008\">World Cup</a> yesterday. After months of ignorance and even derision by some insular Australian league figures towards the tournament, interest has suddenly taken an upward swing in the build-up to Saturday's opener between Peacock's men and Papua New Guinea in Townsville. </p> <p>Yesterday Peacock and the other nine captains were paraded in full strip at the Sydney Football Stadium. Reporters blocked Peacock's progress in the middle of the SFS pitch as determinedly as green and gold opponents have in the past.</p> <p>For England, dealing with an environment as intense and occasionally hostile as that faced by Premier League footballers back home is part of the adventure and Peacock is delighted with the attention. </p> <p>\"I think it makes you proud to be involved in rugby league, that it's so special, that it's taken so seriously over here,\" Peacock said. \"Sometimes in England it's not taken seriously enough or given the coverage it deserves.\" </p> <p>Leon Pryce famously offended the Sydney tabloids at the Tri-Nations two years ago when he favourably compared Blackpool to Bondi while the prop Stuart Fielden was probably referring to reporters rather than players when he labelled Australians \"arseholes\" in a documentary shot during that tour. </p> <p>\"The boys are a bit more experienced in that area. You live and learn from your own experiences,\" Peacock said. \"You've got to be motivated by your own personal reasons rather that what gets written about you. I know some people do use that but I'm not so sure it's the right way to do it.\" </p> <p>But while there were internal divisions during Great Britain's last visit which culminated in Sean Long going home mid-tournament, Peacock notices differences this time. </p> <p>\"When we were here in 2006,\" he said, motioning to the turf at his feet, \"and we knocked Australia off, we celebrated too much. You'd seen us walking around the pitch like we'd won the Tri-Nations when we'd not won anything, really. </p> <p>\"If we're fortunate enough to beat Australia in Melbourne, I don't think you'll see any of that type of celebration. The aim is to come here and get to the final.\" </p> <p>Missing the final on November 22 would be an unmitigated failure, Peacock said. An England win, though, would be a boon for the sport. \"I dream - I am human - I dream what that would be like,\" he said.</p> <p>\"It would be great for everyone in the game, not just those of us at the top but people involved in the amateur clubs. I think with the credit crunch, there's a fight over corporate money at the moment and I think it would be really good for rugby league if we could do that. It would enable us to bring in more sponsors.\" </p> <p>But Peacock acknowledged England's rugby union team had stolen some of the league's thunder by winning their World Cup first. \"You can't be the first man on the moon twice,\" Peacock conceded.</p> <p>\"We'll try landing on Mars,\" he said with a grin. \"If they liked landing on the moon, we're landing on Mars.\"</p>",
  "<p>The international financial system is broken. An integrated set of reforms will be needed to achieve sustained economic growth and shared prosperity. The G8 leaders of Europe, Japan and the US have agreed on an emergency summit this autumn in New York to revamp the international system - a good idea, provided it initiates a wide-ranging set of changes rather than being a one-off meeting focused on market regulation.</p> <p>The G8 leaders are keen to start on regulation and that is understandable. Wall Street, the City of London and other financial centres ran wild with undercapitalised borrowing and lending stoked by over-the-top fees and bonuses. Alan Greenspan's Federal Reserve fed the financial bubble with rock-bottom interest rates and regulatory forbearance, when it had the chance to restrain it. And the derivatives market was allowed to become so vast and unwieldy that there is no clarity as to who owes what to whom in tens of trillions of dollars of credit default swaps and other derivatives.</p> <p>Risk assessments have been made enterprise by enterprise without consideration of systemic risk. When institutions are \"too big to fail\", they must be closely supervised so that indeed they don't bring the entire system down when they do, from time to time, fail. And we have learned again that there is no global lender of last resort, only a hodgepodge of individual central banks and treasuries, whose individual actions may be sufficient or not to stem a panic.</p> <p>The G8 leaders must go well beyond the issues of financial regulation, however. Even before the current crisis, the global economic system was failing in crucial ways. Many poor countries remain cut off from global prosperity, often falling into poverty-induced violence and conflict. These will be still harder hit by the downturn. The global environmental crisis was also worsening, and climate shocks were wreaking havoc with world food supplies. Energy systems were in turmoil as the growing world economy pushed against supply constraints, yet there was no consensus on how to create an energy system compatible with the environmental and economic needs of the planet. These challenges are in desperate need of attention not only on their own merits, but also because global economic growth cannot be sustained without solutions to these crises. </p> <p>Financial assistance to the poorest countries - a lifeline for more than a billion people - is in tatters. Europe and the US have mobilised around $3 trillion in the past month in guarantees and bail-out funds for the banks but failed to mobilise even one ten-thousandth of that this year to help the world's poorest grow more food in the midst of a massive food-price increase and hunger crisis.</p> <p>The US has been blind to the millennium development goals (MDGs) on fighting poverty, hunger, and disease. When George Bush addressed the UN in September - supposedly the mid-point in achieving the goals - he mentioned \"terror\" 31 times while failing to mention the goals even once. All the big donors except Britain - including the US, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, and Canada - are failing to live up to long-standing aid commitments.</p> <p>The leaders should pause to reflect that there is another little-mentioned international summit scheduled for December in Doha, Qatar, to take up the challenge of financing development. It comes six years after a similar summit in Mexico, at which countries pledged \"concrete efforts\" to achieve 0.7% of GNP in development assistance - a level of aid none of them have yet fulfilled.</p> <p>A true Bretton Woods II summit would set a financial framework to achieve urgent global goals in macroeconomic stability, economic development, environmental sustainability and trade for development. All these are vital for long-term sustainable growth, but global goals in all four areas remain unachieved. Summiteers should come with chequebooks and international commitments in hand.</p> <p>Here, then, is an agenda for Bretton Woods II. First, we need to restructure global finance, based on an expanded system of capital adequacy standards, financial reporting, system-wide risk management, and new lender-of-last-resort capacities. Derivatives traders, hedge funds, and broker dealers would be brought under regulatory control. The IMF would be empowered to be a true global lender of last resort (as I urged a dozen years ago, warning of the threat of self-fulfilling panics). To make this possible, a small tax on financial transactions - a Tobin tax - would be implemented to expand the IMF's war chest in case of crisis and to fund other urgent international needs.</p> <p>Second, the new global financial structure should help to rescue the world from human-induced climate change. A straightforward tax on the carbon content of fossil fuels, levied by all countries, would do the job, and much better than the enormously cumbersome emission-trading system concocted and championed by the same financial engineers who brought us our current banking crisis. Most of the carbon-tax revenues would stay at home in each country, to help finance low-emission technologies. Some would be directed to finance three global public goods: research and development on sustainable energy; transfer of sustainable-energy technology to low-income countries; and climate-change adaptation.</p> <p>Third, the World Bank should be refocused with clear goals, and accountability for their success. Specifically, the bank should have one overarching assignment: helping the poorest countries achieve the millennium development goals to reduce poverty, hunger and disease. The bank is poorly organised for such leadership today. Like any bureaucracy, it avoids being held accountable for measurable results. With a tighter focus on the MDGs, the bank should also be supported with much larger financial resources from new revenue sources (such as the Tobin tax), so that the bank can better help the poorest countries expand vital infrastructure (power, roads, water, sanitation and broadband networks).</p> <p>Fourth, the global trade agenda should be integrated with the finance, and environment objectives. The Doha trade round has failed because the world could not see any urgent reasons for its success. A trade agreement worthy of the effort would do two main things. Importantly, it would help the poorest countries to be more productive so that they can be full participants in the global trading system. \"Aid for trade\" would help these countries to build the skills, roads, bridges and clean power grids to support increased trade. In addition, global trade would promote environmental sustainability, to help enforce compliance with reduced carbon emissions and protection of endangered biodiversity.</p> <p>All these reforms are vital for long-term sustainable growth and development. If the political leaders focus only on financial-sector stability, but neglect the long-term problems of energy supplies, climate change, food production, disease control and extreme poverty, then global growth might be restored in the short term, only to succumb quickly to another global bout of rising energy and food prices, and geopolitical instability.</p> <p>The shortcomings of the existing Bretton Woods institutions, global environmental policies and international trading arrangements have been widely recognised for at least a generation. The current global crisis, and arrival of a new US president in the midst of this unprecedented economic meltdown, may finally mark the moment when the world takes seriously the urgent global economic and environmental agenda that confronts us in this new millennium. A summit in December will be a small step but could be the first meaningful action to steer the world to safety from the dire threats we face.</p> <p>\u2022 Jeffrey Sachs is director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University and author of Common Wealth <a href=\"http://www.earth.columbia.edu\">earth.columbia.edu</a></p>",
  "<p>For the handful of Moscow pensioners gathered beside Karl Marx's statue on Sunday there was, at last, something to be cheerful about: Russia's communists are these days a marginal and increasingly doddering force, but what the Soviet Union was unable to achieve in 70 years - the overthrow of global capitalism - now appears to be happening, including in Russia.</p> <p>The most prominent victim is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/oleg-deripaska\">Oleg Deripaska</a>, until recently Russia's richest man. In May his fortune, according to Forbes magazine, was $28.6bn (\u00a317bn). His empire encompassed aluminium, construction, car parts, and the LDV van factory in Birmingham. </p> <p>His fortune outdid even that of his friend Roman Abramovich, the Chelsea owner, by $4.3bn.</p> <p>In April, Deripaska was bullish. His metals firm, Rusal, could soon float in either Hong Kong or London, he said.</p> <p>Six months later, Deripaska has hit the new economic reality with a crunch. Like many Russian oligarchs, he aggressively expanded his business by borrowing billions against the value of his company's assets. Since May, however, these have shrunk. Russia's stock market has tanked - losing a whopping 71% of its value. </p> <p>Spooked foreign investors have fled, because of the global credit crisis but also because of the war in Georgia and the Kremlin's interventions in the market.</p> <p>Earlier this month Deripaska was forced to sell his 9.99% stake in the German construction giant Hochtief and a $1.4bn stake in the Canadian auto parts maker Magna. But it may not satisfy his creditors. </p> <p>Yesterday, the Financial Times reported that Deripaska was trying to borrow $2bn, which he needs by the end of this month to repay part of a $4.5bn loan from western banks that he used to buy a 25% stake in the world's biggest nickel miner. </p> <p>It is, perhaps, too early to talk about the demise of Russia's oligarchs or the return of communism. But experts agree that Russia's super-rich have taken an unprecedented hit. </p> <p>In May, Russia boasted 87 billionaires - a number second only to the US. At least half were likely to lose their billionaire status in 2009, according to the editor of Forbes Russia, Maxim Kalushinky. </p> <p>\"It's still unclear what's going to happen. But we are in a mess,\" he said. \"People have borrowed millions of dollars using their shares as collateral. It's just the same as borrowing money to buy an apartment. Now they have to sell everything to repay the credit.\"</p> <p>However, some of Russia's fun-loving elite are insisting that all is well. Stands at next month's Moscow millionaires' fair, where you can pick up a jet or space-age piano, are all booked out. </p> <p>Last week, however, the financial news agency Bloomberg estimated Russia's top 25 individuals had collectively lost $230bn over the last five months - with Deripaska dropping $16bn. </p> <p>The caviar counters of Moscow's upmarket supermarkets are deserted and Moscow's notoriously snooty nightclubs have relaxed their vigorous system of \"face control\".</p> <p>So far the Kremlin has refused to acknowledge that the global economic crisis has affected Russia. Russian TV says it's an American problem and Vladimir Putin, the Russian prime minister, declared the US's leading role in economic affairs was over. The Russian government has offered $50bn in loans to help the oligarchs, but there isn't enough money to go round, analysts suggest. </p> <p>\"It's definitely very difficult times for these people. But they are not going to go bankrupt,\" Vladimir Osakovsky, chief economist at Moscow's Unicredit Aton brokerage said.</p> <p>Yesterday, Deripaska's investment company Basic Element conceded times were tough. </p> <p>\"There are no companies in the world today that are immune from the consequences of this crisis,\" it said, adding that its \"business strategy remains intact\" and that it would \"stay competitive in the current conditions\".</p> <p>But what about rumours that the oligarch had sacked all his private staff, to save roubles? \"Basic Element does not comment on Mr Deripaska's private matters,\" the company said.</p>",
  "<p>It will be a small step for mankind, but a giant leap forward for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/india\">India</a>. In a boost to national prestige, the country will launch its first unmanned <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/spaceexploration\">moon mission</a> tomorrow - blasting its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/spacetechnology\">Chandrayaan</a> satellite into space from an island off the Bay of Bengal, using a domestically produced rocket system. In doing so, it will match Japan, which in 1990 became the first Asian nation to send a satellite to orbit the moon, signalling the possibility of a race for mineral wealth on the lunar surface.</p> <p>If all goes to plan, India's tricolour flag should be drifting down towards the freezing, airless lunar surface as dawn breaks over the subcontinent on November 11.</p> <p>The 239,000-mile journey is not straightforward - it took the Americans and Russians almost two decades to master it, from the moment space exploration was born. Once above the Earth's atmosphere the launch vehicle's thrusters will have to manoeuvre and fire the Chandrayaan I rocket with precision.</p> <p>If all goes to plan, the satellite, weighing half a tonne, will enter a lunar orbit some 62 miles above the moon's surface on November 8 and begin its two-year mission to map the moon in 3D, survey its surface for mineral wealth and start its 11 hi-tech probes, including five from the US, Sweden, Japan, Germany and Bulgaria.</p> <p>One of India's aims in reaching the moon is the possibility of harvesting helium 3, a key fuel for nuclear fusion. Although fusion is not commercially viable today, scientists say it one day will be, and that once it is a fuel supply will become a problem, as the Earth is believed to have only 15 tonnes of helium 3. The moon is thought to contain up to 5m tonnes.</p> <p>Officials at the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) remain tight-lipped about the possibility of a lunar land grab. UR Rao, a former director of Isro, was less circumspect, pointing out that the moon might have \"enough [helium 3] to produce energy for 8,000 years\". This view echoes that of the head of China's Chang'e project, who told the China Daily in 2006 that \"each year three space shuttle missions could bring enough [helium 3] for all human beings across the world\".</p> <p>Last month, a Chinese astronaut completed a 15-minute space walk for the first time. However, India has big ambitions. There are proposals to put the first Indian into space by 2014 and to launch a manned lunar mission by 2020 - four years ahead of China's target date.</p> <p>The Indian agency's next step is to launch a second unmanned lunar mission in 2011, comprising an orbiting spacecraft, a lander and a moon-rover built with Russian help.</p> <p>The Chandrayaan mission, at a time of economic belt-tightening, has sparked a national debate about whether a country with hundreds of millions of poor people can afford to play catch-up in the skies.</p> <p>S Satish, director of public relations at Isro, said that the Indian cabinet had given the go-ahead for the second mission in 2011, but other missions awaited approval.</p> <p>\"We have to consider the costs for a [manned] moon mission. Even with our low costs it will be billions of dollars. You need a good reason to send someone to the moon for that amount,\" Satish said.</p> <p>Earlier this year India was ranked by analysts at Futron, a hi-tech consultancy, as only a fraction behind China in global space competitiveness rankings, and well ahead of Japan, Israel and Canada. It is also building a low-cost, hi-tech base. China's Chang'e I cost nearly double India's Chandrayaan I bill of $86m.</p> <p>This thriftiness was born of necessity. With an annual budget of about $1bn - less than a tenth of Nasa's - Isro has to do a lot with little.</p> <p>Until now India's space agency has concentrated on putting satellites in orbit. It has 11 communications satellites, using them to bring education and healthcare to remote villages via tele-links with schools and hospitals in cities.</p> <p>\"The whole thrust of [India's space programme] has been to get real benefits,\" said Gopal Raj, author of Reach For The Stars, a book about the country's rocket programme. Raj pointed out that the Madras Institute of Development Studies recently calculated that for every rupee spent on the space programme, two were generated in \"indirect and direct returns\".</p> <p>Critics say that the space mission is a cover for an exercise in \"national military-industrial ego\". </p> <p>Ominously, earlier this year India's chief of army staff spoke openly of his fears about China's military space programme, and stressed the need for India to accelerate its own.</p> <p>\"Let's face it we have an arms race here,\" said Praful Bidwai, a long-time critic of the space programme. \"Rockets that can be used to fire satellites can be used for nuclear warheads, too. India could be spending the money on getting clean drinking water to the poor, get food in their belly. Instead it chooses to blast its way into a space race.\"</p> <h2>Reach for the stars</h2> <p><strong>US </strong>Nasa put Neil Armstrong on the moon in 1969.

  "<p>US congressman Dennis Kucinich has called for an inquiry into remuneration proposals at Wall Street's top banks, after a Guardian report revealed that six distressed institutions had drawn up pay plans, including substantial discretionary bonuses, worth more than $70bn for the first nine months of the year.</p> <p>Kucinich, an outspoken Democratic opponent of the US taxpayer's $700bn bank bail-out, said his staff would immediately begin asking Wall Street firms set to benefit what plans they had to distribute bonuses.</p> <p>\"When Congress placed restrictions on excessive executive pay, it had no intention of permitting business as usual with respect to bonus structures,\" he said. \"It would add insult to injury to ask taxpayers not only to bail out a firm, but to pay for bonuses as well. The Guardian's report necessitates an immediate inquiry.\"</p> <p>Banks continue to peg pay deals to net income. One banking source said 45-50% of net revenue - paid largely in salary and discretionary bonuses - remained an industry standard. This formula does not take into account the huge losses by bank shareholders, many of them pension funds, as firms have queued up to slash the carrying value in their accounts of toxic assets, predominantly sub-prime mortgage-backed securities.</p> <p>Leading the asset write-downs and losses has been Citigroup, which booked a $55.1bn hit. Merrill Lynch, rescued from collapse last month by a takeover offer from Bank of America, has booked $52.2bn to date. Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan Chase, Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs have respectively reported write-downs and losses related to the sub-prime market of $15.7bn, $14.3bn, $13.8bn and $4.9bn. </p> <p>All six banks have as a result been forced to seek multibillion-dollar cash injections to shore up their capital cushions, further denting the holdings of loyal investors. </p> <p>Despite these moves, the banks failed to end panic selling. In a last-ditch attempt to save the system, five of them this month sought bail-out cash from the US taxpayer as part of a $700bn rescue package. The sixth, Lehman, had already collapsed.</p> <p>Third-quarter earnings updates for four of the six Wall Street firms surveyed by the Guardian showed the amount earmarked for salary and bonuses was down on the previous year. Citigroup and JP Morgan were exceptions, with nine-month staff remuneration rising by 4% to $25.9bn, and 2% to $6.53bn respectively. Citigroup's figures include pay for many staff outside the high-risk banking disciplines. </p> <p>The figure for JP Morgan, a division of JP Morgan Chase, rose in large part because of its acquisition of failed rival Bear Stearns and related severance costs.</p> <p>At Goldman Sachs the nine-month pay pot was down 32% to $11.4bn; at Morgan Stanley it was down 20% at $10.73bn, and Merrill Lynch's was down 3% at $11.7bn.</p> <p>Days before Lehman collapsed last month, executives issued an earnings update revealing a $6.12bn pay pot. Administrators in the US allowed $2bn of discretionary bonuses to be distributed to staff before it was acquired by Barclays; banking sources said a sale would have been unlikely without this. However, accrued Lehman bonuses were held back in the disposal of certain European operations to the Japanese bank Nomura.</p> <p>Many European investment banks use the bonuses of US firms as a benchmark for their remuneration policies. </p> <p>HSBC's chairman, Stephen Green, told a Dubai conference yesterday: \"The market and [banking] industry will need to consider whether badly aligned incentives contributed to the crisis: both the market incentives which, until recently, encouraged banks to grow fast and gear up [debt levels], persuading them to take on higher risk than was sustainable, and compensation structures, which have so often encouraged too much opacity and excessive risk taking.\"</p> <h2>From the bloggers</h2> <p><strong>Baylord</strong> When will someone call these crooks to book? ... the very people responsible for bringing down the global economy are filling their boots while hundreds of thousands of families are turfed on to the streets. </p> <p><strong>martinusher</strong> Cheeky sods, aren't they? I'd tax them at source at 99% or more.</p> <p><strong>PCsimon</strong> Some who work in banking do responsible jobs, lending to consumers and businesses, but trading is a zero-sum game. The best way perhaps to solve this is to move our money from banks to building societies, credit unions and the like. They don't play silly games with other people's money. We should also get our pension funds to do the same.</p> <p><strong>Jiri</strong> The bankers deserve every penny of their bonuses. After all, they managed to attract an investment of $700bn plus from the US government. This is a bonus of less than 10%.</p>",
  "<p>Everyone is to blame for the financial crisis, but bankers most of all, according to today's Guardian/ICM poll. It finds near universal agreement that banks caused the crash, but also public scepticism of the government's claim that economic woes have been imported from abroad.</p> <p>Asked who they think is at fault, voters lash out at every possible target. While 93% agree banks must take responsibilty, 92% also blame bad financial regulation, 88% the government, 86% the general global downturn, and 84% consumers, for borrowing too much money.</p> <p>Those totals hide a varied strength of feeling. While 45% think the government must take a lot of responsibility (43% say only a little), 74% say the same about banks. </p> <p>The mood is much more hostile to financial institutions than to the government, which also gets credit: 61% agree Gordon Brown has handled the crisis well. That offers Labour hope. If the prime minister is seen to have performed well, his party's support should go up.</p> <p>But so far that has not happened. Labour is at 30% today. Although markedly higher than dire midsummer results (when support fell to 25%), this is still five points below the equivalent Guardian/ICM score in October 2007. Tory support, at 42%, is two points higher than then, and three down on its summer peak of 45%.</p> <p>So far the voters' response does not seem to reflect the political mood change at Westminster. </p> <p>Perhaps this shift has been too rapid for Labour to benefit yet: a month ago MPs were talking about overthrowing Brown. </p> <p>It is possible that his latest standing will take time to impress itself on voters. But it is also possible that many people have already made up their mind and see no reason to shift. </p> <p>Since the 2005 election, there have been a handful of transforming moments: Labour's March crisis in 2006, involving John Prescott; Tony Blair's resignation in 2007; Brown's hesitation over an election last October; the 10p tax debacle; and now the financial crisis.</p> <p>Of these only two - Blair's departure and the financial crisis - worked to Labour's advantage. The first proved shortlived and the effect of the second has so far been relatively small. The Tory lead has been cut, but not even to the narrow advantage seen at the start of the year.</p> <p>So the prime minister faces two challenges. The first is to persuade voters that after a decade as chancellor he is the right person to take Britain out of recession. Not everyone seems convinced, as today's small Tory lead on the economy shows. </p> <p>The second is to recover his reputation for leadership on issues beyond the economy. Labour's poll rating began to sink a year ago, before the economic crisis began.</p> <p>Brown is applauded now for his financial leadership. That may not win back people who turned away for reasons that had nothing to do with the economy. Labour's political downturn is deep-rooted and will be hard to unwind.</p>",
  "<p>Mortgage lending fell 10% in September to its lowest in more than three years as first-time buyers struggled to get finance.</p> <p>Gross lending in September fell to \u00a317.7bn - 10% lower than in August and a 42% drop from a year ago, according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML).

The Bank of England's interest rate cut from 5% to 4.5%, and the promise from RBS, Lloyds TSB and HBOS to make mortgages available at 2007 levels, will help, but it will take time for confidence and lending to pick up, he added. </p> <p>The CML estimated gross lending for the third quarter at \u00a362bn, down 16% from the second quarter of 2008 and 37% from the third quarter of 2007. </p> <p>Darren Cook, spokesman for financial information provider moneyfacts.co.uk, said: \"First-time buyers are certainly the worst hit.

  "<p>There are two kind of Teaching Awards winners: the perennially modest, charming professional, who, on receiving the award, immediately states that it is for the whole school, and that they are just a part of a fantastic team. Then there's the individual who thinks, \"Sod that! I've earned this. It's mine. All mine, I tell you!\" Thankfully for the school and the locality in which they work, the former variety is vastly in the majority.</p> <p>In June, I presented an award at the regional ceremony for the West Midlands, and it was an occasion that will long stay imprinted in the memory. I sat in front of two near-divine ladies, elegantly clad in their Sunday bests, who were there representing their boss; a boss whose dedication to her work was such that she could not attend herself. </p> <p><strong>Antidote to cynicism</strong></p> <p>On hearing the result, the ladies' tears of joy and excitement; tears they shed not for themselves but for the friend they adored and whose work they held in reverence, could not fail to tug even the hardest of heartstrings. Their reaction was, for me, emblematic of the deep humility, loyalty and passion for kids' achievement that is the rule among Teaching Awards winners. The regional Teaching Awards ceremonies are an antidote to cynicism, and could the atmosphere at these events be bottled and sold, it would have to be under strict licence. They are addictively joyous.</p> <p>The regional Teaching Awards are the perfect justification for the existence of any scheme to recognise excellence in service to education. Regional winners are recognised for having provided enormous service to their community. This is what they entered the profession for. A regional Teaching Award is a badge redolent of meaning to its holder. Having won both a national and regional award, for me it is the regional prize that still holds a special place in my heart. To have been judged to be one of the best teachers in London is, surely, big enough a validation for any teacher.</p> <p>Having won the regional award, though, the winners go through a further rigorous and exhaustive judging process to see who will be awarded the golden Plato, the national Teaching Award. As Ted Wragg, who was there at their inception and was for many years chair of the UK panel of judges, was fond of saying - tongue only partially in his cheek: sometimes the decision of who to give the national award to was so difficult that he'd resort to putting the names on a dartboard, closing his eyes, and letting a glibly thrown dart tell him the winner's name. Though no real reflection of the seriousness with which the judges approach their task, Wragg's gag gives a sense of how difficult the job must be. How does one go about judging between the professional skills of 13 of the most outstanding professionals in their field? </p> <p>The answer is that three highly regarded educationalists (often former Teaching Awards winners themselves) observe several of the regional award-winners teaching a lesson. They then interview them, their pupils, the parents they serve, the colleagues they work with and their headteacher. The judges even go so far as making assiduous checks on the degree of excellence in their marking, planning and report writing. It is the ultimately nerve-cracking, one-person Ofsted: and the teacher who is adjudged UK winner can be assured that they have come through the toughest of inspections alongside the toughest of competition. </p> <p>At the national ceremony, which is held in a posh London theatre and is invariably described as being \"glittering\", 11 of the country's best professionals are asked to do something to which they are unused. They are asked to stand in a spotlight and take the nation's applause on behalf of their fellow professionals. This is not what they entered the profession for, and most are pleasingly clumsy in the glare; relieved to return back to school on Monday, to be back where they are most comfortable, in classrooms full of children.</p> <p>But in having taken that round of applause, they have given the hundreds of thousands of people who watch the ceremony each year on the BBC the opportunity to think, once again, of their own favourite teacher, and of the profound debt they owe them. Perhaps, even, to think about thanking their own children's teacher for the hard work they have done for them. </p> <p>The national Teaching Awards ceremony is that rare thing for newspaper editors: an unambiguously good news story about education and about teachers. As such, the Teaching Awards will have a place in our diaries for many, many years to come, and should be embraced by an occasionally embattled profession that's not over-accustomed to the acres of positive press that the awards generate.</p> <p><strong>Unsung heroes</strong></p> <p>The Teaching Awards also make stars of teachers. Some might be cynical about this, but in giving a voice to denizens of the classroom, it breaks the mould. Prior to the advent of the Teaching Awards, the only education professionals ever to be granted either a regional or national voice, to be listened to by the media, and to be able to put the education system's case to millions, were be-knighted headteachers, who may have long left the classroom, and whose perspective will necessarily be tainted by obedience. But the education system's case is not the same as the teachers' case, and the Teaching Awards have allowed potentially dissident voices airtime. Voices whose natural environment is the classroom, not the meeting room; voices prepared to state publicly the rarely heard (but truthful) mantra that the British education system is a unique environment: one in which the cream stays at the bottom.</p> <p>It is now 10 years since the first national ceremony was held at Alexandra Palace. In that time, some 1,237 teachers and teaching assistants from well over 1,000 different schools have been honoured. On 1,237 occasions the Teaching Awards have made someone feel as special as they are; 1,237 times a whole school has been given cause to gather together to celebrate one of their own, and 1,237 times have members of communities gazing at the local news been caused to note that a teacher at \"the local school\" has won an award. </p> <p>The fact that there have been so many winners over the past decade means that there are few communities that have not been touched in some way by the Teaching Awards. Few communities who are yet to receive the boost of recognition that inspires a whole school with the message, \"You are important. You are appreciated.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Phil Beadle was winner of the Guardian award for secondary teacher of the year in 2004</p>",
  "<p>Laura Brodie, winner of this year's primary headteacher of the year award, doesn't actually run a school. Allens Croft is a children's centre, offering medical and other support services to the under-fives and their parents, as well as inspirational education. Those families live in one of the 26 most deprived wards in Birmingham. All the more reason, she says, to offer the very best facilities available. </p> <p>Nine years ago, she began to look at international comparisons while studying for her MEd. Accordingly, she has visited equivalent projects in Denmark and Sweden as well as Reggio Emilia, the Italian town that pioneered positive developments in early-years nurturing. \"They look at the child and family in the round, using the arts to create a very rich environment. Not that we're trying to replicate everything they do - we're in south Birmingham, not northern Italy.\"</p> <p>Nonetheless, it's fair to say that the Allens Croft Centre, the result of a \u00a35.2m investment, is by far the most impressive building in the local area. Open since Easter, it also evolved from a trip to Italy - to the Domus Academy for Design in Milan. Brodie seems to have excelled at conveying exactly what she wants to those who designed the building as well as the health and social care professionals that share it. \"If you can convey a vision with passion, they're on your side from the start,\" she says.</p> <p>Brodie also has a nose for unearthing talents among local parents who weren't aware that they had any. All but two of the 38-strong education team are or were parents who live nearby. No fewer than 21 of the staff have reached level 3 or above at NVQ, and several who started at basic skills level have now attained degree level in childcare. Dawn Gallagher, a qualified secondary school maths teacher, came to Allens Croft as a volunteer while she was having her two children. Now she is a full-time teaching assistant. \"There's a real sense of magic about the place,\" she says. \"As soon as you come here, you see it in the children's faces. The work here is powered by Laura's enthusiasm.\" </p> <p>\"If you mess things up at this level, you're storing up problems for years ahead,\" says Brodie. \"Ours is an interwoven service, combining health and social care with education. You're cradling the family, holding them up. But they can get out and run whenever they want to.\" </p> <p>\"She's here from 8am to 5.30pm, and then she goes home to be a mother,\" says another local parent, Lisa O'Connor. \"That might entail being up all night, but she'll still be here in the morning.\" O'Connor's two children have now moved on to the nearby primary school, but she has stayed on, initially as a teaching assistant. She now handles marketing. \"Laura's very good at persuading you that you can do things that you never thought you were capable of,\" she says. </p> <p>According to Brodie, one of many enjoyable aspects of running Allens Croft has been watching the intake become much more ethnically varied. \"We have around 49% from different cultures, and that's wonderful for a place like this,\" she says. Brodie has also tried to vary the educational input in terms of age and gender. Men in the community are encouraged to come into the centre as positive role models. So are grandparents with good stories to tell about their very different life experiences. </p> <p>\"One woman takes her leg off and puts it on the sofa before she starts,\" Brodie beams. \"The children love it.\" And, as far as the primary headteacher of the year is concerned, that's what counts.</p> <h2>NCSL award for headteacher of the year in a primary school</h2> <p><strong>Regional winners</strong></p> <p><strong>Peter Hoyland</strong>, Dunster first school (West); <strong>Laura Brodie</strong>, Allens Croft childrens' centre (West Midlands); <strong>Debbie Lewis</strong>, Herbert Thompson primary (Wales); <strong>Mark Lees</strong>, Plymouth Southway primary (South-west); <strong>Peter Farrington</strong>, The Prince of Wales school (South); <strong>David Reid</strong>, Manor Green primary (South-east); <strong>David Dickson</strong>, Armstrong primary (Northern Ireland); <strong>Joanne Ramsbottom</strong>, Farington primary (North-west); <strong>David Jones</strong>, Holybrook primary (North); <strong>Stephen Fraser</strong>, St Michael's CE primary (North-east &amp; Cumbria); <strong>Wendy Jacobs</strong>, Rosendale primary (London); <strong>Debra Massey</strong>, Howe Dell primary (East); <strong>Chris Wheatley</strong>, Cotgrave Candleby Lane school (East Midlands)</p>",

  "<p>The public finances fell to a record deficit last month, driven down by a weakening economy and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/economy\">government overspending</a>, and analysts say much worse is to come as the economy tips into recession.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics said public sector net <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/debt\">borrowing</a> was higher than expected at \u00a38.1bn last month, a record for a September and almost double the \u00a34.8bn shortfall of September 2007. </p> <p>That left the cumulative borrowing for the first half of the 2008/09 fiscal year at \u00a337.6bn compared with \u00a321.5bn in the same period a year ago and the highest since records began in 1946.</p> <p>\"The September public finances were dreadful, deteriorating even more than expected,\" said Howard Archer, economist at consultancy Global Insight. \"This highlights the extremely poor state of the public finances as they are hit by past largesse, the marked economic slowdown ... weak housing market activity, rising unemployment and government policy concessions since the March budget.\" </p> <p>In his March budget Alistair Darling forecast a shortfall for the 2008/09 fiscal year to March of \u00a343bn. But yesterday's figures show that total has been almost reached halfway through the year, meaning he will have to increase the figure in next month's pre-budget report. </p> <p>In a Commons statement yesterday the prime minister, Gordon Brown, also signalled that the government's fiscal rules - designed to stop public finances spinning out of control - may be abandoned. </p> <p>Arguing that British net public debt is well below European levels, he said greater borrowing was justifiable to avert an economic downturn. \"Like all governments across the world, we are considering how fiscal policy can support the economy at this time,\" he said. \"Carefully targeted, rigorously worked-through investments that help people fairly through the downturn and lay the foundations for stronger growth in the future. </p> <p>\"And in Britain's case we can start from the position of low public debt.\" </p> <p>David Cameron said a further public spending splurge was wrong and said Britain could be heading for a record budget deficit. </p> <p>Brown said: \"With interest rates low and falling, inflation expected to come down over the next year, these underlying economic indicators - particularly interest rates - make us stronger than at any other previous downturn.</p> <p>\"Debt has been considerably lower than a decade ago, and lower than all G7 countries except Canada, enabling the government to increase borrowing at the right time to support the economy.</p> <p>Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat leader, said Brown had ignored their advice for years about the \"unsustainable nature of the credit and housing boom\".</p> <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the growing deficit was down to spending running ahead of the March budget plans and tax revenues coming in lower.</p> <p>\"If these trends continue, public sector net borrowing will come in around \u00a364bn this year,\" said Gemma Tatlow, an IFS economist. \"If the government had acted earlier to address its repeatedly optimistic forecasts for public finances, we would not now be embarking on a recession with public sector borrowing and debt as high as they are.\"</p> <p>She said it was right that the government was planning to let borrowing rise as the recession took hold. \"But the pain cannot be delayed forever: once the current crisis abates, this government or its successor is likely to have to introduce a combination of new tax-raising measures and further spending cuts,\" she said.</p> <p>The national debt ticked up to 43% of national income including the Northern Rock liabilities that are now on the public finances, or 38% if they are excluded.</p> <p>One bright spot was that Northern Rock had reduced its impact on the national debt from \u00a3100bn to \u00a382bn over the past nine months as it has repaid a significant chunk of its government loan.</p> <p>The Ernst &amp; Young Item Club, an economic thinktank, predicted that borrowing would reach about \u00a360bn this year but rise to \u00a392bn in 2009/10, equivalent to 6% of national income. Some economists are predicting it could be \u00a3100bn or more.</p> <p>Philip Hammond, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, acknowledged that \"borrowing always rises when the economy slows\", but added: \"Gordon Brown's failure to prepare means that borrowing has reached record levels before we've seen the worst of the downturn.\"</p> <p>The government's finances could be further undermined because of a fall in the tax revenues from big businesses.</p> <p>According to a report by the House of Commons' public accounts committee published today about two-thirds of the corporation tax paid by the UK's 700 largest companies in 2005/06 comes from just three sectors: insurance, oil and gas - which has benefited from the high oil prices - and the banking industry, which has taken the brunt of the fallout from the global credit crunch.</p> <p>Local authorities are also facing the prospect of falling revenues as a result of the downturn. One report suggests the slowdown could cut the amount paid through the business rate over last year and the current financial year by \u00a32.5bn.</p>",

  "<p>Economic recession and depression can lead to exclusion and, at worst, persecution of the most vulnerable groups within society.

  "<p>Any attempt to pursue the kind of job creation strategy advocated by Polly Toynbee (Jobs, jobs, jobs must be the mantra for a softer recession, October 18) - also in line with the government's own strategy - is bound to be a repetition of the expensive and wasteful failures of both past and present. There is ample research evidence that the long-term employment benefits of such public investments are negligible and that they can only be justified in terms of the specific public purpose they are designed to serve (eg improved school buildings). As for urban regeneration projects (such as the London Olympics site), international experience shows that the long-term beneficiaries are mainly property developers rather than local residents.</p> <p>In a world where the goal of \"full employment\" is becoming more and more unattainable, policies based on the assumption that everyone should be in a full-time paid job are outdated. Instead we should implement the idea of a citizen's income - set initially at a minimum survival level, say \u00a3110-120 per week - to which all adults would be entitled as of right and which would replace most, if not all, other welfare benefits. </p> <p>This would have the benefit of getting rid of the whole expensive, degrading system of means-testing. It would also have the important merit of sustaining money circulation in the economy, countering the negative impact of rising unemployment and poverty much more effectively than costly, old-fashioned job creation schemes.<br><strong>Harry Shutt</strong><br>Horsham, West Sussex </p> <p>The chancellor is quite right to invoke Keynes and, for that matter, Roosevelt's New Deal as he seeks to direct government spending to create jobs and keep the productive economy afloat (Darling invokes Keynes as he eases spending rules to fight recession, October 20). But suggesting that it is kept afloat by replacing the Trident missile programme is like rebuilding your house from straw as a tsunami gathers on the coast.</p> <p>The moment calls for investment in windmills, not swords. As set out in the Green New Deal, published by the New Economics Foundation earlier this summer, by spending now to build a low-carbon economy, we could generate a vast new carbon army of highly skilled green collar workers, building new energy infrastructure, transport networks and super-efficient buildings. This would join up the need to cope with the impacts of peak oil and climate change, as well as kick-starting the economy. Viewed even in the light of Roosevelt's New Deal, Darling's approach looks short-sighted - Roosevelt's version included the Civilian Conservation Corps, which involved millions of Americans in wilderness preservation, the basis for the emergence of modern environmentalism in the US.</p> <p>A government with vision could use the current crisis to deliver a crucial national plan for a low-energy future and its provision on the ground. <br><strong>Ruth Potts</strong><br>New Economics Foundation</p> <p>The idea that spending \u00a325bn building new Trident nuclear weapon submarines will boost the economy is patently absurd. Despite the huge cost, the employment level is minimal - less than 3,500 at the BAE Systems shipyard in Barrow and smaller numbers elsewhere. Major defence projects suck in vast resources which could be used to stimulate not only a more socially useful form of employment, but a much higher number of jobs and broader economic benefits. <br><strong>Kate Hudson</strong><br>Chair, CND</p> <p>In an economic downturn there is an inevitable rise in unemployment. New minister Phil Woolas immediately plays to the gallery, implying that the job losses are the result of immigration.</p> <p>Two factors seem to have been overlooked. First, a high proportion of the jobs done by migrants are the ones that Brits don't want to take. Second, the systematic selling of British jobs to low-wage countries (eg call centres, Dyson manufacturing) has been going on for years, with no public criticism. The main effect of this is anything but increased efficiency and customer care, but a rapid rise in profits and bonuses.<br><strong>Ike Gibson</strong><br>Ullapool, Ross-shire</p>",
  "<p>A quarter of a century after it arrived in the racing calendar, brash and dripping with bling, the Breeders' Cup is an event that can still generate plenty of cynicism. As one colleague put it last week, when faced with the suggestion that this weekend's meeting would be the most important yet: \"Every single Breeders' Cup has been the most significant ever. Hope it's not going to go all Hank Paulson one day.\"</p> <p>The implication, clearly, is that the Cup could be the sporting equivalent of all the Wall Street institutions that have disappeared into the sewers in recent weeks. In terms of sheer sporting drama, it is not a charge that has ever had much weight. Arazi's win in the Juvenile, for instance, would be the choice of many 40-somethings as the most memorable racing performance of their lifetime. </p> <p>It is the feasibility of the Cup's loftier, long-term ambitions that remain in doubt, the ones that involve bringing together the world's best form lines to find global champions. </p> <p>In a sense, though, this year's meeting - the first of two successive Breeders' Cups at Santa Anita - marks the start of Phase Two of the entire project. Bit by bit, the issues and conditions that have prevented the Cup from being a fair test for all are being stripped away and the inaugural event on a synthetic surface is an immense step forward. </p> <p>The move away from dirt surfaces has met with plenty of resistance in the US. There are few who truly expect the march of synthetics to be stopped, though, particularly given the attention directed towards the sport by both the government and well-resourced animal welfare groups since the gruesomely public death of Eight Belles in this year's Kentucky Derby. </p> <p>On this basis, the two Cups at Santa Anita need to be seen as a whole. For many Flat horses, two years is a career and forward-thinking European trainers have been quick to grasp the significance. Aidan O'Brien is pitching both Duke Of Marmalade and Henrythenavigator into the Classic, while David Wachman's Bushranger goes to the Juvenile. </p> <p>Whether or not their challenges succeed, the winners of both races will have extra merit in the eyes of breeders not just for having beaten the best from two continents, but for having done so on the surface of the future. </p> <p>This is also linked to the other obstacle to the event's global ambitions - medication. One reason that American racing got hooked on drugs is that it was the only way to keep horses sound when they were training and racing on dirt. Without the dirt, the urge to medicate should start to diminish.</p> <p>The ultimate goal is to finally change the mindset among punters too. At the moment, when they consider the Juvenile form with a view to next year's Kentucky Derby, they are likely to think: \"Shame it was on synthetic, when the Derby is on dirt.\" At some point, though, it needs to change: \"Shame the Derby's on dirt when all the best form's on synthetic.\"</p> <p>That will be the point when Churchill Downs, widely expected to hold out like the Alamo when it comes to synthetics, will be forced to fall into line (unless, of course, they have another primetime fatality first). </p> <p>It might be next year, in time for the 2010 Breeders' Cup, or it might take 10 or 20, and the success, or otherwise, of this year's event could inform the whole process. A good reason, in other words, why this really is the most significant Breeders' Cup yet.</p>",

  "<p>It was like listening to a dour Scottish dominie lecturing his pupils on the virtues of thrift. It didn't work as well as it might, because the kids can see the Porsche parked at the back and they heard about the fortnight in the Maldives. But that didn't stop him.</p> <p>The prime minister began his statement on the European council meeting with a return to the old, careful, cautious Gordon - the Gordon we knew before he started spending money like a man who knows the bank is about to collapse and he might as well have a good time while he still can. Prudence was again at his elbow, possibly like the school matron with a bottle of something unpleasant for obstreperous boys.</p> <p>We needed a return to hard work, enterprise, and responsible risk taking - not irresponsibility and excess, he told us. He demanded transparency, integrity, responsibility, sound banking and international governance. It sounded most impressive, and very Presbyterian, right up to the moment that he called for openness: \"Off-balance vehicles [metaphorical vehicles, that is, not the Porsche] must go back on to balance sheets!\"</p> <p>The Tories collapsed in laughter because the whole thrust of their argument against the dominie is that his magical debt statistics (we are allegedly less in debt than almost any other country - yeah, right) are based entirely on keeping as much moolah as possible away from the balance sheets. For him to make this stern demand was as ludicrous in its way as Peter Mandelson calling for an end to spin, or Boris Johnson insisting that we all use styling gel.</p> <p>The prime minister was clearly discommoded by this laughter - when you are going around the world claiming to have single-handedly rescued the entire global financial system, you expect a bit of respect and don't quite know how to cope when it isn't there. He stumbled. \"We need a rabbit!\" he announced. The Tories collapsed again. Was this his cunning plan - a rabbit out of the hat? And would a rabbit be enough? Surely we needed to pull a massive Highland stag out of a hat. \"A rabbit!\" he repeated. \"Er, a rapid return to internationally agreed standards!\"</p> <p>David Cameron was torn between statesmanlike mode, standing shoulder to shoulder with the government to save our economy, and cheeking the teacher. He finished by settling for the latter - record deficit, no growth, heading into recession with a completely bare cupboard. It's much easier to be bipartisan while you're comfortably ahead in the polls; harder when your once reviled opponent is doing slightly better. The dominie replied with his own statistics, doubtless equally fictitious, or at least equally irrelevant to our problems. He listed several steps he had taken which the Tories had opposed - including one or two which they hadn't opposed at all, which infuriated them. \"They don't like it up 'em!\" chortled one Labour MP, with more enthusiasm than originality. </p> <p>At the end we heard from Sir Peter Tapsell, who rose majestically to lecture the dominie on his multitudinous shortcomings. \"Did he explain to the Euwopean council [Sir Peter has a slight speech impediment] that his misjudgment was wesponsible for the fact that his FSA failed to supervise AIG in London's Mayfair ... default credit documents ... AIG ... almost evewy bank in the world thweatened with bankwupcy.\" Sir Peter rather spoiled the magnificent effect by talking for wather, sorry rather, too long and the dominie flipped him aside by pointing out that AIG is an insurance company, not a bank, which didn't answer the question, but bought him a few moments of time until the bell rang.</p>",
  "<p>The problem is simply stated. As Gordon Brown - discussing what he perceives to be an improvement in his political fortunes - says, \"an hour is a long time in politics\". It used to be a week, but everything is speeding up. To remain in office or to remain in business, decision-makers must privilege the present over the future. Discount rates ensure that investments made today are worth nothing in 10 years' time; the political cycle demands that no one looks beyond the next election. </p> <p>The financial crisis is just one consequence of a system which demands that governments sacrifice long-term survival for short-term gains. In this case, political leaders on both sides of the Atlantic - from Reagan to Brown - decided to appease business lobbyists and boost short-term growth by allowing the banks to use new financial instruments, many of which were as dodgy as a three-pound coin. It made perfect political sense, as long as the inevitable crash took place after they left office. </p> <p>For similar reasons we are likely to be ambushed by other nasty surprises: runaway climate change, resource depletion, foreign policy blowback, new surveillance and genetic technologies, skills shortages, demographic change, a declining tax base, private and public debt. Politics is the art of shifting trouble from the living to the unborn. </p> <p>At first sight, the government's strengthening last week of the UK's climate change target seems like an exception to this political short-termism. In fact something rather interesting is taking place in Britain. While prime ministers in Italy and eastern Europe are demanding a bonfire of environmental measures in order to save the economy, in the UK politicians from all the major parties have made the connection between environmental destruction and economic meltdown. One of the fastest spreading memes is the proposal for a Green New Deal: a Keynesian package of environmental works designed to boost employment and channel public investment. If this idea is adopted, it won't be the first time that it has helped to rescue a major economy. The biggest and most successful component of Roosevelt's New Deal was the Civilian Conservation Corps, which employed three million people to plant trees and stop soil erosion. </p> <p>But all such proposals soon collide with the realities of the political cycle. As Ed Miliband, the climate change secretary, admitted, \"signing up to an 80% cut in 2050, when most of us will not be around, is the easy part; the hard part is meeting it, and meeting the milestones that will show we are on track.\" A recent paper in the journal Energy Policy shows that the government is pursuing the wrong policies to meet the wrong targets, produced by using the wrong methods to assess the wrong data. (Otherwise it's more or less on track.) </p> <p>The paper shows that to help deliver even a small chance of preventing 2C of global warming, the UK can generate a maximum of between 17bn and 23bn tonnes of carbon dioxide between 2000 and 2050. In the first five years of this decade we produced 3.6bn tonnes: at this rate, our carbon budget would run out by 2028. To hit the government's temperature targets, the UK's carbon emissions need to fall by between 6% and 9% a year from 2012 onwards. At the moment, they're still rising. </p> <p>Current policy, in other words, bears no relationship to the long-term target. On this trajectory, the only way in which the government could meet its obligations under the climate change bill would be to buy the cut from other countries, which means that it will make no contribution to a global reduction. </p> <p>But at least in this case, there's a recognition that current policies have long-term implications. Elsewhere, the government simply refuses to look beyond the present, for fear of seeing something it doesn't like. For instance, it has failed to conduct any assessment of global oil supply. When I asked the business department what contingency plans it has to meet the eventuality that oil production might peak, it told me, \"the government does not feel the need to hold contingency plans\". The survival of our transport networks - and therefore of the economy - is secured by touching wood and crossing fingers. </p> <p>In other cases, the question isn't even raised. Food policy everywhere is governed by the expectation that crop yields can keep growing to meet rising demand. A possible limiting factor is the supply of the phosphorus rock required to make fertiliser. I asked the researcher Tom Bailey to produce an assessment of global phosphate deposits that can be exploited at reasonable prices. </p> <p>He found a wide range of estimates and a good deal of confusion between reserves (known deposits that can be readily exploited) and resources (the total geological stock). The most extensive survey published so far suggests that the global demand for phosphate is likely roughly to double by 2050. Can this demand be met without pricing food out of the mouths of the poor? Perhaps. Some reports suggest that phosphate constraints will provoke a global food crisis by the middle of the century. </p> <p>This, in other words, is a critical question. Yesterday I searched the last five years of parliamentary records in the UK. It hasn't been discussed once. But the possibility that aircraft passengers and crew might be exposed to trace amounts of another phosphorus compound - tricresyl phosphate - has been mentioned 1,670 times in the same period. This is a minuscule issue in comparison with the question of whether the world can be fed. But it has the great political virtue of affecting people today. </p> <p>In 1791 Thomas Paine complained that \"the vanity and presumption of governing beyond the grave is the most ridiculous and insolent of all tyrannies\". He was answering Edmund Burke's contention that a declaration made by parliament in 1688 bound the people of England \"for ever\". A parliament that considers only the immediate consequences of its decisions imposes the same insolent tyranny on succeeding generations. They have no means of contesting the legacy of economic crises, depleted resources and limited choices we bequeath to them. </p> <p>What can be done about political short-termism? With the environmental thinker Matthew Prescott, I've hatched what might be a partial solution. We propose a new parliamentary body - the 100-year committee - whose purpose would be to assess the likely impacts of current policy in 10, 20, 50 and 100 years' time. Like any other select committee, it would gather evidence, publish reports and make recommendations to the government. It would differ only in that it had no interest in the current political cycle. Its maximum timeframe would be roughly the residence time of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. </p> <p>The members of this committee would not be equipped with crystal balls but they would be released from the need to balance the interests of the present against a heavily discounted future. Their purpose would be to provide a voice for those who have not yet been enfranchised. A 100-year committee could not insure us against political stupidity, but it would deprive governments of the excuse that they couldn't see trouble coming.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com\">www.monbiot.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Last week, the director Richard Eyre sent an email to a friend. With governments busy nationalising banks, and the consumerist boom giving way to a new sense of dread, he decided that now was the moment to cast the net for material that captured the spirit of the times. Was anyone already on the case, he wondered. \"It's only - what? - 20 years since the death of communism and socialism was announced,\" he says, \"and now the age of the self-regulating free market turns out to have only lasted 20 years. Right now, I think that's The Great Subject.\"</p> <p>Eyre has yet to discern the kind of clear plotlines that might make for compelling drama. \"'String up the bankers' would be pathetic, but kind of understandable, because of all that very visceral rage and despair,\" he says. \"But I think what we're looking at is similar to the response to global warming: the sense that people feel terribly impotent. I suppose you're looking for someone who expresses that, and it's difficult to dramatise despair, confusion and uncertainty.\" </p> <p>\"But I'm optimistic,\" Eyre maintains. \"Cometh the hour, cometh the genius.\"</p> <p>Across the arts, consensus has yet to emerge about what the slump may bring. There is anxiety about ticket sales, sponsorship and subsidy - but also, in some places, optimism about a rising public need to seek solace in a music download or a trip to the cinema. </p> <p>Lean times, many observers point out, tend to lead to a surge in creativity. The Roaring Twenties have their fans, but plenty of people prefer the stuff that came in the wake of the Wall Street crash: the politicised plays of Clifford Odets, John Steinbeck's novels, the songs written by Woody Guthrie, even Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times. The New York that still partly grips our imagination is not the gentrified, upmarket city of the early 21st century, but the graffiti-strewn, crime-ridden place of the 70s and early 80s, which catalysed the art of Julian Schnabel and Jean-Michel Basquiat, the first stirrings of hip-hop, and the music of Blondie and the Ramones. Similarly, thousands of people still get misty-eyed about the explosion of British creativity prompted by the messy end of the postwar consensus and the battles of the 1980s: drama written by Alan Bleasdale, Howard Brenton and David Edgar, the confrontational sculpture of Tony Cragg, or the sparse, cutting songs written and sung by the young Billy Bragg. </p> <p>Like all of those names, Bragg is still very much with us, cited as an influence on a new crop of rock groups - the Enemy, Hard-Fi, Arctic Monkeys - whose social-realist songs served early notice of the insecurity that preceded the financial plunge. Bragg discovered the Enemy, he tells me, when he was handed a promotional flyer linking their music to the closure of the Peugeot factory in their native Coventry. It is voices like theirs, he believes, that will most convincingly soundtrack a recession.</p> <p>\"What happens in times like this is that songwriters go from staring at their belly-buttons to staring at the TV,\" he says. \"When the economy is relatively stable, there's plenty of room for 'poor pitiful me'. But when times are hard, it becomes 'poor pitiful us'. People are going to have to start articulating these things, because what's happening is going to affect everybody. It's going to be very, very interesting.\"</p> <p>If some of music's loudest voices were almost prophetic about the downturn (have a listen, for example, to Hard-Fi's 2006 hit Cash Machine, complete with its refrain, \"There's a hole in my pocket\") , the fortunes of the record industry have also been ahead of the curve. It has been in the midst of lay-offs and budget cuts for at least five years. </p> <p>Sounding a note of optimism, Paul Williams, the editor of trade magazine Music Week, points to creditable recent sales for the likes of Oasis and Kings of Leon, and a pre-Christmas schedule that includes records by such big sellers as Beyonc\u00e9 and Snow Patrol. But he also admits to the key difference between recessions past and present. \"If you look at downturns in the past, there doesn't seem to be any great evidence of declines in music sales,\" he says. \"But what's different this time is file-sharing and what it entails. It's illegal, of course, but there's now the possibility of getting hold of free music. From that perspective, the industry is entering into the unknown.\"</p> <p>Should the music industry nosedive, it may not be a calamity for creativity. \"What you need in difficult times is a hard edge, and strong integrity,\" says Bragg. \"If you have those things, I think you'll find an audience, particularly because of the internet. More and more will recognise the viability of doing it themselves.\"</p> <p>In the art market, there are no signs of panic just yet. Some insiders insist that the arrival of blue-chip collectors from eastern Europe, India and China will cushion the top end against recession, citing as evidence the recent Damien Hirst auction at Sotheby's, and steady trading at last week's Frieze art fair. Then again, another Sotheby's auction last week, including works by Hirst and Andy Warhol, saw sales falling well short of predictions: the total take was \u00a322m, against estimates of as much as \u00a343m. On Sunday at Christie's, Lucian Freud's portrait of his friend Francis Bacon fetched just \u00a35.4m, near the low end of the \u00a35m-\u00a37m guide price. </p> <p>There is also a lot of anxiety about \"the death of the middle\", where artworks trade for between \u00a35,000 and \u00a350,000. The over-arching prediction seems to be something serious, but not drastic: a pronounced slowdown rather than a crash.</p> <p>What will definitely suffer, it seems, is the kind of art that sits well outside the market, and depends on sponsorship and subsidy: the series of giant installations in Tate Modern backed by Unilever, for example, or Antony Gormley's Angel of the North. </p> <p>\"The idea of creating very expensive, ambitious installations and grandiose public projects and sculptures - by definition, during a recession that has to decrease,\" says Tim Marlow, director of exhibitions at London's White Cube gallery. \"Artists will have to start thinking, 'Can we actually justify doing something that exists, will then be destroyed, can't possibly be sold, and gets lots of public money?'\"</p> <p>Marlow adds that anyone looking to art for commentary on the economic crisis will be disappointed. Partly, he says, this is because of the democratisation of video and photography, and the profusion of images on the web. \"If you want something much more explicit, that's the place to look.\"</p> <p>Perhaps, I suggest, contemporary art has proved much more suited to documenting boom rather than bust. One thinks of the overblown excesses of that former Wall Street broker Jeff Koons, or, more recently, Damien Hirst's \u00a350m diamond-encrusted skull.</p> <p>'I'd actually argue that the skull contained within it the inevitability of bust,\" says Marlow. \"One of the whole points about it was, 'You can't take it with you,' and Damien said so. It subverted the idea of boom, and hinted at a downturn.\"</p> <p>It's a description that rather brings to mind the title of Hirst's most famous installation, The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living.</p> <p>\"Exactly,\" Marlow agrees. \"The physical impossibility of bust in the mind of someone booming.\"</p> <p>What about the theatre? The West End is already suffering, with a string of shows ending their runs early, ranging from Girl with a Pearl Earring to the musicals Never Forget, Avenue Q and Eurobeat. One recent report in the Times claimed that every theatre on Shaftesbury Avenue had tickets to spare - even productions with big-name leads such as Rain Man, with Josh Hartnett. </p> <p>At Manchester's Royal Exchange Theatre, artistic director Sarah Frankcom does not need much persuasion to sketch out the anxious times ahead. Her theatre's current three-year agreement with the arts council is up for renegotiation in 2010, and there are worries about a possible cut in funds, not least because of the diversion of \u00a3675m of lottery money from the arts to pay for the Olympics. She sounds even more fearful about the prospects for corporate donations to the Royal Exchange - which last year totalled \u00a3500,000, and included gifts from Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays. </p> <p>\"That money is vulnerable, and it's going to be dramatically cut, one would think,\" she says. \"I don't think you'll see signs of it right away, but for the next generation of actors, directors and writers, the sources of money that support them in the early part of their careers will either dry up or be drastically reduced.\"</p> <p>On the plus side, the Royal Exchange is attracting more people than it has done for four years. \"I think our audience is facing a sense of uncertainty, and they seem to be responding to big plays and big themes. That's very interesting: from what I'm told, in the recession of the early 1980s, a lot of theatres were encouraged to move their repertoires towards entertainment, but the people who are coming through our doors at the moment are very hungry for plays that make them think.\" She mentions the 2,000-plus new scripts that have just been entered for the Royal Exchange's biennial playwriting competition, sponsored by property company Bruntwood - brimming, she says, with work that \"wants to make sense of what's happening with the world: globalisation, social exclusion, personal responsibility, political accountability\".</p> <p>Though all that suggests rude creative health, it rather bumps up against a fear that runs across all areas of the arts: that what recession will really cause is a desire to escape into an all-singing, all-dancing fantasy world. \"The other day,\" says Eyre, \"I was looking at an advertisement for Hunger, the Steve McQueen film [about the Republican hunger striker Bobby Sands], which I hear is magnificent. And I was thinking, 'Aren't they on a hiding to nothing?' I would love to think that people are queueing round the block for it, but I have a feeling that the Fred Astaire syndrome is coming shortly.\"</p> <p>Which brings us to cinema, and an old statistic that is being endlessly quoted in an attempt to raise the industry's spirits. In the year that followed the Wall Street crash, US cinema audiences rose by 58%. That is not quite enough to allay worries that the more challenging end of film-making will be hit by a fall in subsidies, not to mention the drying-up of credit from the banks.</p> <p>Looking into the more recent past, there may be a few causes for optimism. During the long period of crisis and uncertainty that stretched from the mid-70s into the 80s, there was an upsurge in the idea of film-making as social commentary, seen in such classic New York movies as Taxi Driver and The Warriors, and brilliant British films such as The Long Good Friday and Mike Leigh's Meantime. Critic Mark Kermode, however, points out that that this wave of \"meaty films dealing with topical subjects\" was accompanied by the rise of escapist blockbusters such as Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark. \"Think about Indiana Jones - it looks like an old B-movie. As opposed to being low-down and gritty, those films were spectacular.\"</p> <p>Today, Harvey Weinstein is preparing a movie version of Nine, the Broadway hit set in 1960s Venice, featuring Daniel Day-Lewis, Nicole Kidman and Judi Dench. There are also reports of imminent remakes of Fame and Footloose. As Variety magazine recently put it: \"It's beginning to look a lot like the 1930s: the economy is in the toilet and Hollywood studios are filling their pipelines with upbeat dance films, particularly teen hoofers.\"</p> <p>If such news doesn't fill you with excitement, one thing has to be said: compared with some of the stuff that will boom despite the bust, films like those may well look like great art. \"In terms of cinema that makes money, look at Transformers,\" says Kermode. \"That's where we are right now: great big, infinitely stupid films about robots from outer space hitting each other. The other thing is, it's not coincidental that the Superman series has been revived, and so has Batman. Even if it's postmodern and ironic, that's going to continue, because it's what people want in times of crisis: superheroes.\"</p>",
  "<p>Nato needs to adapt, and adapt fast, if Afghanistan is not be lost. This was the clear message delivered in a brief and pithy speech in London by the alliance's supreme military commander, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/3229284/Nato-chief-says-members-lack-political-will-for-success-in-Afghanistan.html\">General John Craddock</a>. There was a lot more to the general's text than met the eye and ear.</p> <p>He was stating what the western allies now face in terms of global threats \u2013 from piracy to networked terror groups \u2013 and the ways in which they must be prepared to up the ante in order to tackle them. It is one of the clearest statements yet of how the elite sees America post-Bush, in particular in relation to the allies.</p> <p>Effectively, the general called for a wholesale reform of structure and attitude by Nato military command. \"We need deployable, capable and agile forces,\" he said, \"that can be dispatched quickly to meet new emergencies.\"</p> <p>America was already sending an <a href=\" http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,416904,00.html\">extra brigade</a> into eastern Afghanistan, under the plan by David Petraeus in his new job as head of US Central Command, which covers the Middle East as well as Afghanistan. Craddock said he wanted European Nato nations to send more troops to Afghanistan \u2013 to make sure things don't fall apart at the time of the crucial presidential and assembly elections next summer.</p> <p>He said he welcomed Germany's pledge of <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,561669,00.html\">1,000 extra troops</a> and hinted he would like to see more troops from Britain, too.</p> <p>He said he wanted to see Nato develop a new strategic concept at its 60th anniversary summit in Strasbourg next year. All heads of government in the alliance must sign up to Nato's policies and aims in Afghanistan. The operations of the International Support and Assistance Force, Isaf, should be paid from a central fund. This would be a big break with the past as Nato military contingents are currently paid for by their national governments.</p> <p>He was looking for a way of ending the system whereby member governments are allowed to opt out of commitments and operations by playing their own \"red\" and \"yellow\" cards \u2013 by entering what are known as \"national caveats\". The general said there are at present more than 80 national caveats in play in Afghanistan.</p> <p>The last time Nato signed up to a new strategic concept was at the <a href=\"http://www.nato.int/docu/comm/1999/9904-wsh/9904-wsh.htm\">Washington summit</a> on the 50th anniversary in 1999. It declared that the alliance was no longer a defensive organisation for the protection of Europe and North America, the role for which it was invented at the outset of the cold war in 1949. The new dispensation meant that it could operate as an expeditionary force for stabilisation and humanitarian operations far from the homes of the member nations. Curiously, the summit was held as Nato was involved in a hot war close to home \u2013 the air offensive against Serbia over Kosovo.</p> <p>\"The new concept then was for the threats of the late 20th century,\" warned General Craddock. \"Nato needs a new strategic concept for the threats of the 21st century.\"</p> <p>The general was broadly in agreement with the statements of the outgoing British brigade commander in Helmand, <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article4887927.ece\">Mark Carleton-Smith</a>, that conflict against the Taliban couldn't be won in purely military terms. \"This is not like the second world war, where the outcome was a victory of annihilation and unconditional surrender.\" It had to be resolved by other means \u2013 including talking to moderate elements of the Taliban.</p> <p>The mood at General Craddock's meeting was that next year would be decisive for the present government and constitution in Afghanistan. \"If we can't hold credible elections next year in Afghanistan, with reasonable legality and security, the whole international effort there will be in real trouble \u2013 it could fall apart.\"</p> <p>The big question now becomes ever more glaring: is Afghanistan strategic ground? Can the international powers pull out, and would this leave the region in peace, or does it give space to the Taliban and the new generation of al-Qaida commanders?</p> <p>Retreat from Kabul or defeat in Afghanistan would call into question the viability and future of Nato. But if Nato dissolved, something like it would be bound to be invented to take its place \u2013 and in the process we would all be a lot worse off in blood and treasure.</p>",
  "<p>Elements of Iran's ruling clerical and political elites are enjoying the west's financial implosion. It has deflected attention from the country's internal troubles and its increased international isolation. And as the campaign for next June's presidential election gathers pace, capitalism's travails handily illustrate the supposed superiority of Iran's unique system of collectivist Islamic republicanism.</p> <p>Leading prayers in Tehran last Friday, <a href=\"http://www.metimes.com/Security/2008/10/17/ayatollah_blames_us_for_economic_woes/99e7/\">Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami</a> declared that US-promoted liberal democracy was collapsing under the weight of its moral contradictions. \"It started with an ethical downfall and has now reached an economic failure \u2026 See how sad the funeral is! Even the undertaker is crying! They tried to create a crisis for us [through UN sanctions] but God created a crisis for them.\"</p> <p>Such triumphalism is unlikely to last long or be widely shared among a population enduring 30% inflation, high unemployment, and the continuing failure of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to share Iran's oil wealth and boost family incomes as he promised. Ahmadinejad, elected in 2005, is expected to run again. But unease over his confrontational nuclear policies, his Holocaust denial, and threats against Israel are all additional reasons why he may be denied a second term.</p> <p>Recent developments have driven home the weakness of the current regime. One was the UN general assembly's vote, by a humiliating 158 to 32, to deny Iran a two-year rotational membership of the security council. John Sawers, Britain's UN ambassador, undiplomatically called the vote a \"thrashing\". Tehran blamed Zionist lobbying for what it called an \"<a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUKTRE49J35520081020\">obvious injustice</a>\". But the bottom line was plain: more than three-quarters of the world's countries do not trust Iran to do the right thing under its present leadership.</p> <p>Ahmadinejad's government has had to back off at home after a 3% sales tax provoked widespread protests. More significantly in terms of the coming election, the sudden halving of the global oil price has damaging implications for Iran's foreign earnings, for badly needed oil and gas investment, and for an impoverished domestic economy as a whole.</p> <p>The president's unpopularity does not automatically mean defeat. He retains the support of the Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, the Revolutionary Guards and ubiquitous Basij militia. He has a strong following among the less educated, rural poor. And as usual, the broadly-defined \"reformist\" opposition, consisting of numerous rivalrous individuals and factions, is badly divided, lacking a common standard-bearer.</p> <p>Mohammad Khatami, the former two-term president who disappointed many supporters with his cautious approach in office, is nevertheless most frequently mentioned as the reformists' likely candidate. The Mehr news agency reported this week that Khatami had decided not to run and had proposed a former prime minister, Mir-Hossein Mousavi, in his place. But his intentions remain unclear.</p> <p>The only declared major contender for Ahmadinejad's job so far is <a href=\"http://www.iranfocus.com/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2392\">Mahdi Karroubi</a>, a former Majlis (parliament) speaker with a reputation as a moderate. He announced his candidacy last week. Karroubi indicated a more flexible approach to nuclear negotiations and said Iran had \"paid dearly\" for Ahmadinejad's Holocaust stance. He also hinted he might step aside if the reformists could agree to unite behind Khatami.</p> <p>All the same, opposition disunity and factionalism remain a bigger enemy than the \"principle-ists\" (fundamentalists) of the clerical right. Jahanbakhsh Khanjani of the Executives of Construction party warned recently that the reformists could win but only if they stuck together in a coalition. \"Undoubtedly convergence, solidarity and consensus will have positive effects among reformists and will set the ground for their victory,\" he told the Mardom-Salari newspaper.</p> <p>Ahmadinejad may yet face a more potent challenge from moderate conservatives such as Ali Larijani, the former nuclear negotiator who he forced out of the national security council, or Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, a former Tehran mayor known a moderniser. Larijani is now Majlis speaker and is said to have the ear of the Supreme Leader. Lurking in the background, as ever, is Hashemi Rafsanjani, another former president and veteran consevative power-broker who was runner-up in 2005.</p> <p>Yet as Iranians look for voluntary regime change next June, all the likely candidates share one major drawback: over-familiarity. The biggest obstacle to change is apathy among an electorate where a majority is under 35. Many younger voters may think Iran, for once, should take a leaf out of the Great Satan's book and seek a \"transformational figure\" \u2013 not another regime re-tread.</p> <p>No need for Israeli or American military action: Ahmadinejad is politically vulnerable and could well be removed peacefully by his own people if the west will only wait. But first, perhaps, Iranians should find their own version of Barack Obama.</p>",
  "<p>Pat Kavanagh, the UK's best-known literary agent, who represented a string of leading writers for decades, died today at the age of 68.</p> <p>Kavanagh, married to the novelist Julian Barnes, had scaled the heights of her profession, representing writers including Ruth Rendell, Margaret Drabble, Robert Harris, Joanna Trollope, Andrew Motion, Clive James and Wendy Cope.</p> <p>She died this morning of a brain tumour, a spokesman for the company she co-founded, United Agents, said.</p> <p>Harris, a client for 27 years, said everyone who knew Kavanagh was reeling from the loss. \"She was fantastically efficient and just the person you wanted to have represent you,\" he said. There was no one quite like her, really. And she was exotic, like a bird of paradise. She was unflappable, and she didn't let you get above yourself. </p> <p>\"She always described herself as being like a family doctor or a country solicitor. She didn't believe in trying to screw an enormous amount of money out of publishers.</p> <p>\"Pat was always quite indiscreet and very funny. And you know, in a world full of bullshit, there was no bullshit from Pat. She didn't suck up to her writers.\"</p> <p>Kavanagh's last year was dominated by dispute. She led a walkout of 29 agents from what was once the UK's pre-eminent literary and entertainment agency, Peters, Fraser and Dunlop (PFD), and helped set up United Agents. It was a measure of the high esteem in which she was held that all her clients went with her.</p> <p>The dispute had its origins in the sale of PFD, in 2001, to CSS Stellar, a global sports and entertainment marketing group. When Kavanagh led a \u00a34m attempt to buy back PFD, she was rebuffed, sparking her decision to set up United Agents.</p> <p>Though Kavanagh took the agency battle badly, there is no suggestion that her illness had anything to do with the episode.</p> <p>Harris said: \"Her last year was very much clouded by this terrible dispute. She took it hard, harder than any of us realised.\"</p> <p>His fellow client and novelist Blake Morrison said there had never been any doubt but that the writers would stick with Kavanagh. </p> <p>\"She was the finest agent of her generation,\" he said. \"If you look at who she represented, it's a pretty impressive list. There's a reason for that: she was completely trustworthy, and when you sent her a typescript she would always let you know what she thought in no uncertain terms. She had complete integrity. </p> <p>\"There was a period in the nineties where there were these big advances, and along came the new agents luring people away with promises of megabucks. Pat would absolutely do her best for her clients but she knew publishers' pockets aren't infinite. Both publishers and authors had enormous respect for her.\"</p> <p>Some have compared her to Peggy Ramsay, a similarly no-nonsense agent who represented many of Britain's leading playwrights in the 1950s and 60s. And she has a place in fiction after Jeanette Winterson based her 1992 novel, Written on the Body, on the affair she and Kavanagh once had.</p> <p>Morrison said the split with PFD was \"a very unpleasant business\". <br>He added: \"I think she felt a huge sense of injustice that she wasn't treated well, and it was a pretty miserable year, although one hopes the illness is completely separate.</p> <p>\"She had the values of an earlier generation. People like Kingsley Amis loved Pat. She was old school, but she never seemed jaded. We all thought she would always be there, that she would never retire.\"</p> <p>Kavanagh was also, for 23 years, the agent of Martin Amis, until he switched to Andrew Wylie, an agent who has been called the Jackal, in 1995. Kavanagh's husband, Barnes, ended his friendship with Amis shortly afterwards. </p> <p>The writer Hermione Lee said: \"Pat Kavanagh was my friend and agent, and to say the word 'was' in speaking of her is very hard for me to do.\" Lee said she loved and admired Kavanagh for her truthfulness and dignity and \"her refusal ever to be false or gushing.

It's been like a fast car crash in slow motion,\" she said. \"Pat never said anything she didn't mean.

  "<p>If the latest <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/20/polls-economy\">Guardian-ICM poll</a> isn't a reality check for Gordon Brown then the words simply have no meaning. For the poll is compelling evidence that politicians and partisan commentators who should have known better have talked Brown's performance up with dizzying disregard for the political facts. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordonbrown\">prime minister</a> has saved the world. He commands the political scene. He is once more the dominant figure in British politics. We have read all these claims and more in the past week or two. But they are simply not true. Naturally, Brown would like them to be the case. He would like commentators to talk as if they were true. He is doing everything he can to encourage the world to take him at his own estimation. He undoubtedly sees the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">financial crisis</a> as a huge political opportunity which he is manifestly enjoying.</p> <p>Maybe in time this will be so, but the poll figures tell another truth right now. At a moment when, if the Brown hype was true, Labour would be slashing back the Conservative poll lead and forging into large leads on handling of the economy, what does ICM find? It finds that the Conservatives are on 42% and Labour on 30% \u2013 exactly where they were just after the Tory conference. The world saved \u2013 and not a single percentage point in the polls to show for it. There's gratitude for you.</p> <p>The poll tells a powerful list of uncomfortable facts. It finds that voters think David Cameron and George Osborne are a whisker ahead of Brown and Alastair Darling as the better team to manage the economy \u2013 not lost in the dust. It finds that twice as many voters are less likely to vote Labour as a result of the crisis than are more likely to do so \u2013 that's right, LESS likely, not more. And it finds that the government is seen to have been part of the problem \u2013 more people blame the UK government for the crisis than blame the US housing market or the global economy.</p> <p>In the financial markets the prices go dizzyingly up and down. The hope of Labour ministers and their followers is that politics has suddenly become as volatile as the economy. This is not the case so far \u2013 though perhaps it will become so over time. In the political markets things seem to be staying much the same. The Labour government is still unpopular. The Tories are still more likely than not to win the next election. The real lesson from the politics of October 2008 is not that everything has changed, but that it hasn't. </p> <p>Early election? No way.</p>",
  "<p>The Queen has helped trigger a resurgence of interest in wind projects in the deep waters off Britain by promising to invest in projects at a time when onshore and other offshore schemes are struggling to meet their potential in the face of planning delays and other problems.</p> <p>The decision by the monarch's crown estate, to pay up to half of all pre-construction development costs, has brought a surge in applications for the latest round of wind licensing with almost 100 companies wanting to build farms far into the North Sea.</p> <p>\"The crown estate offering to be a development partner takes away much of the cost and uncertainty with third-round projects, which is why we have seen so much interest in the latest licensing round,\" said Adam Bruce, chairman of the British Wind Energy Association (BWEA), on the eve of its annual conference to be opened by Gordon Brown tomorrow.</p> <p>The Queen's property arm has also shown its willingness to be at the forefront of the battle against climate change by agreeing to buy the world's biggest wind turbine, the 7.5MW Clipper Windpower MBE prototype, codenamed Project Britannia. </p> <p>The turbine, said to be powerful enough to provide power for 5,500 homes, is under construction in Blyth in north-east England, and will be eventually towed out and erected in the North Sea. </p> <p>Although deep-water projects were expensive and the cost of steel and other materials was soaring, they could be far more efficient because they could utilise larger turbines and take advantage of stronger prevailing winds, said Bruce. </p> <p>\"Unlike onshore wind schemes, the operator is also only dealing with one planning regime and one landlord in the crown estate which is now offering to be a partner,\" he added.</p> <p>The organisation, which has responsibility for licensing the seabed up to 200 miles off-shore for renewable projects, will help pay for the cost of undertaking studies on what impact a particular wind plan would have on shipping and marine life.</p> <p>The cost of doing that will later be clawed back from revenues once the wind turbines are turning. Ninety-six companies expressed their interest by last month in becoming involved in the third licensing round, far more than in previous rounds. The crown estate is considering the offers and will make a decision on who will win the chance to proceed with schemes on 11 favoured sites, called zones.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the crown estate said the response to the licensing round had \"greatly exceeded our expectations\". The crown estate, which owns large parts of Regent Street, London as well as 55% of Britain's foreshore, traces its history back to the reign of King George the Third, who swapped much of his land for a fixed income from the Treasury.</p> <p>The deep-water interest is a welcome boost for the wind industry which is still hobbled by problems that ministers have repeatedly promised to sort out. <br>A new planning bill is meant to streamline wind projects but the BWEA pointed out today in a new review that half of the 7GW of wind capacity stuck in the planning system is located in Scotland and not covered by the legislation, while a further 3.5GW is below a 50MW threshold.</p> <p>There are still difficulties, with the ministry of defence and the aviation industry over the alleged threat to radar coverage posed by wind turbines. Government has again promised help resolve these difficulties but problems remain.</p> <p>\"It is not possible to quantify the risk to a project from an aviation perspective - the objections cannot be easily predicted and a pre-planning statement of no objection is not always valid through the planning process,\" says the BWEA. </p> <p>The prime minister will reiterate his determination to clear any logjams and ensure wind reaches its potential. Brown will say that his decision to create an dedicated energy and climate change department is proof of how seriously he takes both global warming and energy security. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Carbon Trust will tomorrow announce that it has reached agreement with five major energy companies under which \u00a330m will be invested to find ways to reduce the cost of offshore wind by at least 10%. </p> <p>Airtricity, ScottishPower Renewables and StatoilHydro will work with RWE Innogy and DONG Energy to research and develop ways of cutting costs and improving efficiency at wind farms at a time of mounting concern that rising costs are chasing investors away from renewables.</p> <p>The move comes just days after the Carbon Trust, an organisation established by government to help speed up the introduction of clean energy, unveiled a report showing that ministers would fail to meet their offshore wind goals unless a variety of measures were introduced. Among proposals was one allowing operators to develop a new generation of wind farms closer to shore.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/china\">China</a> has fuelled fears over a global recession by warning that the financial crisis is damaging its economic growth.</p> <p>Data released today showed China's gross domestic product expanded by 9% in the third quarter of 2008, down from 10.1% for the second quarter. Although this is still extremely healthy compared with other major economies, it is less than expected by experts \u2014 and the first time GDP growth has dipped below 10% in almost three years.</p> <p>China's government blamed the lower growth on the world economic slowdown, which means less demand for Chinese exports. </p> <p>\"The growth rate of the world economy has slowed down noticeably. There are more uncertain and volatile factors in the international economic climate,\" said spokesman Li Xiaochao of the National Bureau of Statistics. \"All these factors have started to release their negative impact on China's economy.\"</p> <p>After years of boom, there are signs that the Chinese economy may now be suffering from the fallout from the credit crunch. GDP growth has now slowed for the past five consecutive five quarters. </p> <p>The country is a huge consumer of raw materials, and last week the global mining giant Rio Tinto caused share prices in the sector to slump by warning that demand from China was slowing down. Analysts believe GDP growth will slow further in the fourth quarter, as the impact of the financial crisis bites.</p> <p>Huainan Zhao, a banking expert at Cass Business School, London, said: \"The problem is that China's economic growth is slowing down when it is most needed. But I am afraid that the world will have to live with a slowing Chinese economy. The Chinese GDP will decline from 12% last year to about 9.6% this year. The reduction of the 2 or 3% of the GDP is what at the moment is mostly needed by the world.\" </p> <p>One of the most worrying aspects for the Chinese leadership is that net exports contributed only 1.2 percentage points to total GDP growth over the nine months, down from 2.4 percentage points over the same period of 2007.</p> <p>Since President Hu Jintao took charge in 2004 with a mission to correct the imbalances that have accumulated throughout China's economy since the market reform process began in 1978, senior leaders have talked about boosting domestic consumption by raising incomes and improving social services, but growth has remained thoroughly export-led.</p> <p>Already forced to yield to international pressure to revalue its currency and make its goods more expensive overseas, China is now facing a significant slump in demand as the recession hits its markets in Europe and America. A back-up plan has become more urgent than ever. </p> <p>Last week, China's senior Communist party leaders approved plans to strengthen the rural economy and improve the incomes of farmers, hoping that making citizens better off would create a new market for the millions of computers and household appliances being shipped abroad. For now, the measures appear to be too little, too late.</p> <p>Stock markets across Asia recorded gains overnight - after a week of volatility - as traders welcomed a $130bn bail-out (\u00a374.32bn) of South Korea's banking sector.</p> <p>Today, the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/korea\">South Korea</a> government announced it would take fresh action to support its banks; $30bn of fresh liquidity is on offer, plus loan guarantees totalling $100bn.</p> <p>The move came just days after ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's put the country's five biggest banks on a ratings watch. S&amp;P warned they could struggle to repay foreign loans, as the South Korean won has fallen by a third against other currencies since January.</p> <p>Before the data's release, government leaders met to map out a strategy for countering the slowdown. Newspapers carried reports of planned measures to spur lending and stabilise the country's volatile financial markets. Share prices, for example, are still down nearly 70% from the peak they hit a year ago. </p> <p>Li said that a range of measures - including export tax relief - will be introduced in the next few months to ease the pain. A rescue plan for the real estate sector is also in the works. </p> <p>The leadership has also vowed to spend more on welfare and construction, such as rebuilding the areas devastated by the earthquake in Sichuan province in May.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338837810\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2008/10/20/21.10.08.China.exports.gif\" alt=\"China exports\" width=\"462\" height=\"432\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>",
  "<p>Washington DC is a candidate for the title of least sexy city in the world. It's a place where adult men still wear <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/tucker_carlson/index.html\">bow ties</a> in daylight without a hint of irony. So it's all the more surprising that the heads of Washington's most powerful institutions have trouble keeping their pants on.</p> <p>It's not just the politicians. Last year Paul Wolfowitz's brief and unhappy tenure as president of the World Bank dissolved amid a scandal involving promotions and pay rises awarded to his then partner, who also worked at the bank. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/may/18/imf.economics\">Wolfowitz resigned</a> amid a welter of claims of ethical misconduct. Now it's the turn of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, who found himself on the <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122427783161845699.html\">front page of the Wall Street Journal on Saturday</a> over an affair he appears to have had with an IMF employee.</p> <p>In Wolfowitz's case, his signature policy at the World Bank was crusading against corruption and championing the cause of good governance. So when details emerged of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/may/15/usnews.imf\">Wolfowitz's conduct</a> and his inappropriate behaviour, his position at the head of the bank became untenable. Strauss-Kahn has no such problems, but because of the precedent set by the treatment of Wolfowitz, solid evidence of any similar impropriety would put his position in doubt.</p> <p>In Strauss-Kahn's case the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/19/world/19imf.html\">details</a> appear to be that he had an affair with Piroska Nagy, a senior female IMF economist, at a conference earlier this year. Her husband found out - and he was a former IMF economist. Nagy later took voluntary redundancy from the fund - along with 600 others during the IMF's massive restructuring. The <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSTRE49H19920081019\">questions being investigated</a> hinge on whether Nagy was pressured to leave, or whether she received preferential treatment or payment in her redundancy agreement.</p> <p>Nagy's lawyers say she got the same payoff as everyone else, and that she wasn't <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2008/10/18/no-pressure-on-hire-of-woman-tied-to-strauss-kahn-ebrd-says/?mod=googlenews_wsj\">pressured</a> in any way. Strauss-Kahn describes it as an \"incident which occurred in my private life\". His wife, the French TV broadcaster Anne Sinclair, says it was a <a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hQGicZ5mK3PXlq3tVvyHGXFLZ7Mw\">one-night stand</a>. No one, so far, has produced any evidence suggesting anything more sinister, although the IMF engaged an outside law firm to conduct an investigation before the affair became public knowledge.</p> <p>Obviously, with the world in a financial crisis of hitherto unimaginable dimensions, the timing isn't great. Having the head of the IMF tied up with lawyers while the global capital markets collapse isn't very helpful - but perhaps Strauss-Kahn should have thought of that earlier. Even without any pressure or payoffs involved, institutions such as the bank and the fund have strict rules about staff relationships, for good reason, and the heads of those institutions should adhere to them.</p> <p>(One sidelight is that if DSK - as he's known - is forced out, then Gordon Brown has an escape-route away from No 10 Downing Street if he so desires, by taking the IMF top job - one he has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/mar/05/uk.economy\">considered in the past</a>, by many accounts.)</p> <p>But why did a tabloid scandal turn into the front page splash of the Wall Street Journal? Tempting though it may be to blame the recent purchase of the Journal by Rupert Murdoch, there's much more going on here involving Washington's multinational power politics. One possibility is that the US, in particular, is open to getting payback for the Wolfowitz humiliation - and the US's most senior representative at the IMF played a role (according to the WSJ), along with the Russians, in pushing for an investigation. The Journal itself also took Wolfowitz's side last year - its comment pages became a caricature of right-wing rage on the subject (although that isn't unusual for the Journal, it has to be said).</p> <p>Along those lines, DSK is not popular with some of the fund's executive directors, including the US, for his desire to make the IMF a more progressive place, particularly his desire to dilute practices such as \"conditionality\" - the quid pro quo conditions imposed on those countries - most often the world's poorest - to which it gives assistance.</p> <p>The Americans were also unhappy at the fund's most recent health check of the US economy and its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/apr/09/useconomy.subprimecrisis\">criticism</a> of US policy. (And the fund was vindicated by recent events - contrary to what some believe, the IMF has long criticised the US for precisely those policies that led to the financial crisis.)</p> <p>So far this seems to be little more than an embarrassment for Strauss-Kahn. But that could change. If Strauss-Kahn is found to have intervened on the woman's behalf (whether benevolently or maliciously) then he will be under pressure to go the same way as Wolfowitz. Or if other, similar affairs are revealed, a similar outcome can be expected.</p> <p>The incongruity here is that the current financial crisis has suddenly made the IMF relevant again, just when it was in danger of losing its reason for existing. Now it's doing what is supposed to be doing, all over the world. Maybe if being head of the World Bank or IMF wasn't regarded as a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/may/18/usnews.imf\">sinecure</a> for sidelined male politicians from the developed world, then there might be more newsworthy activity in the boardroom than in the bedroom.</p>",
  "<p>Major League Baseball attendance has dropped for the first time in five years. In a cost-cutting move, the NCAA recently sent a letter to its members outlining new postseason travel restrictions. The future of the Grand Prix du Canada, the only formula one race in North America, could be in jeopardy with the recent announcement that organisers have pulled their financial backing.</p> <p>Even the sports world reels. It can't avoid or escape, not this time, the salvo of economic blows. Bankruptcies, bail-outs and dubious mortgages, which Warren Buffett once called, back in 2003, \"financial weapons of mass destruction,\" dominate the headlines. The Dow recently had its worst week ever. And sports won't be far removed from the effects of it all.</p> <p>Economic turmoil historically has had little impact on sports. As an escape from quotidian drudgery and gloom, sports even thrived during The Great Depression. But that won't be the case this time around, except perhaps for a few.</p> <p>The old business model for sports franchises was simple: Sell tickets and hot dogs, win games and make money. Revenue depended on ticket sales and concessions \u2014 depended, in other words, on the average fan. But when sports teams and leagues became big business, they hitched their prosperity, along with their futures, to all those economic indicators and factors that have veered in recent weeks onto a bumpy, perhaps even treacherous, road.</p> <p>\"It will have a different effect than it would have 15 or 20 and certainly 30 years ago,\" said Michael Leeds of Temple University, co-author, with Peter von Allmen, of The Economics of Sports, about the economic downturn. \"That's because sports teams and leagues have very much shifted their focus from the average fan to corporate interests. And that, I think, will come back to bite them a little bit.\"</p> <p>Or maybe bite them viciously. At this point, though, it's impossible to tell how deep the bite will be. But the effects could be felt for years, and they're already becoming apparent. With season-ticket renewals down, the NBA is laying off 80 workers, or 9% of its work force. Commissioner David Stern explained the reduction by citing a \"deteriorating\" economy that's a \"bit wobbly.\" The MLB's Arizona Diamondbacks are searching for a company to sponsor their right-field pool; the original sponsor has filed for bankruptcy protection.</p> <p>Through the first nine months of the year, the handle, or money wagered, at North America's racetracks has dropped 5.75% from a year ago, according to the National Thoroughbred Association. The Milwaukee Mile has blamed a loss of sponsorship dollars for its not paying its cleaning bill.</p> <p>The impact on sports is ubiquitous; it even affects billionaires. Talking about his efforts to buy the MLB's Chicago Cubs, Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban told the Chicago Sun-Times that the \"failing economy\" has put the \"brakes on the sale.\" The economy, Cuban said, will affect the deal and \"create a challenge.\"</p> <p>But not only do they feel the effects; sports also provide a measure of the nation's economic problems. How severe must the problems be if the LPGA Tour loses four sponsors and General Motors announces it won't air a commercial during the Super Bowl? </p> <p>And like the economic downturn itself, which has spread with seismic reverberation, the effects on sports have become global. The Olympic Delivery Authority has had to rely on \"contingency funding,\" and the British government may have to contribute more than $250m (\u00a3145m) toward the completion of the Olympic Village for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/olympics2012\">2012 Olympic games.</a></p> <p>Construction has stopped on a new 60,000-seat stadium for the Liverpool Football Club of the Premier League because of the credit squeeze. One of the team's foremost owners is Tom Hicks of Dallas, Texas who also owns the MLB's Texas Rangers and NHL's Stars.</p> <p>Shrinking sponsorship revenue could impact sports almost immediately, explained Wayne DeSarbo, the director of the Centre for Sports Business Research at Pennsylvania State University. Teams and events that depend most heavily on sponsorships, naming rights and luxury suites will probably be first to feel the economic tremors. But the downturn could influence merchandising, concessions and marketing, and eventually, DeSarbo said, if it persists, the effects could touch ticket sales and player salaries. \"It depends on whether we're seeing the entire iceberg or just the tip,\" DeSarbo said. \"My sense is that this will not be a long-term phenomenon.\"</p>",
  "<p>Consumers have been warned that their broadband bills could soar after the EU opened the door to \"net neutrality\" \u2014 unrestricted, first-come-first-served access to the internet.</p> <p>Amid warnings that the internet was becoming congested, experts said European consumers could end up paying billions of euros more for new broadband platforms under net neutrality.</p> <p>A new Centre for European Policy Studies paper due to be published this week says the US model would oblige normal users to subsidise heavy users, would give no incentive to service providers to invest in new-generation networks and encourage \"free-riding\" by applications and content providers.</p> <p>The warnings come before high-level talks in Venice later this week between Viviane Reding, EU media commissioner, and the heads of global telecommunications and cable operators.</p> <p>Net neutrality is due to be discussed by the EU's 27 telecoms ministers next month when they put the finishing touches to legislation designed to improve regulation, encourage investment and offer broadband coverage to all of Europe's 500 million citizens.</p> <p>Industry sources said Reding, MEPs and the current French presidency of the EU had opened the back door to net neutrality by tabling amendments to the universal service directive, part of the telecoms package. This would enable national regulators to set minimum quality of service requirements to prevent \"degradation\" of service or slowing of traffic over networks.</p> <p>The internet is becoming congested because a single movie download in high definition requires as much data as 2300 songs or 35,000 web pages, according to new research from Copenhagen experts sponsored by the telecoms industry. YouTube consumes as much bandwidth as the entire internet did eight years ago.</p> <p>Reding's proposals to handle this congestion have pitched service providers such as telecoms operators against application/content providers such as Google, a process she has described as \"arm wrestling\" between the two sides over \"hard cash: dollars and euros\".</p> <p>But national regulators, such as Ofcom in the UK, are reluctant to endorse net neutrality. Ed Richards, Ofcom chief executive, said today: \"We don't think we should bring it over from the US lock, stock and barrel. We have quite often got more competitors in Europe than in the US.</p> <p>\"The key for us is transparency. Consumers must know whether there are different arrangements for different ISPs and network providers must have the freedom to make commercial decisions about how to run their networks and invest in new-generation networks.\"</p> <p>Separately, Richards urged the EU to endorse the telecoms package and strengthened independent regulation rather than revert to an era of protected national monopolies run by political whim. This was critical, he said, to ensure growth potential and attract scarce capital to information and communications technology and creative industries.</p> <p>Richards indicated that the 27 telecoms ministers were now more likely to adopt compromise proposals removing the unconstrained powers of the European Commission to veto decisions by national regulators.</p> <p>The proposed compromise would hand greater influence to the European Regulators' Group (ERG). The ERG, in turn, could be beefed up with more staff and resources and act as a \"college of supervisors\" for the European industry now that Reding's plan for a European communications market agency under Brussels control had been defeated.</p>",

  "<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/lisphelan\">Lis Phelan</a> to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/chrishopkins\">Chris Hopkins</a></strong></p> <p>Greater Manchester is facing a congestion crisis. We are not alone in this as <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/driving/article3200991.ece\">car numbers rise</a> across the developed and indeed developing world. </p> <p>What is unique is how our city region's congestion has got worse as our economy has boomed in recent years. Ten years ago, Greater Manchester's peak-time traffic moved more quickly than the national average. Now it moves more slowly. This is despite investment of roughly half a billion pounds spent on our road network, including the completion of the M60 and the inner relief road. </p> <p>If we do not deal with this crisis, within the next decade it will start to have a substantial negative impact on our economic growth and the health of our communities. </p> <p>Unlike any other UK regional centre, Greater Manchester has a <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7481944.stm\">plan that deals</a> with the problem. A \u00a33bn investment in our <a href=\"http://www.rochdaleonline.co.uk/news-features/2/community/14912/report-claims-transport-investment-will-bring-10000-jobs\">transport network</a> through the Transport Innovation Fund (TIF) will transform our bus network, with other investment already committed, giving us a tram network over three times the size of our current Metrolink, and provide longer trains running through refurbished stations. </p> <p>Motorists and businesses will benefit from a reduction in traffic on the roads similar to matching the fall in school holidays. Parents and schoolchildren will benefit from the introduction of a fleet of new yellow school buses. There will also be substantial improvements to traffic management. </p> <p>Some \u00a31.2bn of this investment is supported by a limited, peak-time only congestion charge \u2013 in towards Manchester city centre in the morning, outwards in the evening \u2013 matching the times and the places when congestion has the greatest impact on our economy and quality of life. </p> <p>The vast majority of people (9 out of 10) will not pay a charge, and those who do will have the alternative of a 21st century transport system \u2013 far better than any comparable city in the UK. And this system will be in place before a charge is introduced. </p> <p>This massive investment will support our international competitiveness, improve quality of life, air quality and the health of our citizens, and put Greater Manchester at the forefront of the battle to expand economies while limiting CO2 emissions. </p> <p>Every major city region in the world is looking at ways to combat rising transport congestion, and Greater Manchester will never have a better opportunity to decisively deal with this problem through creating a modern, efficient, integrated transport network.</p> <p><strong>Chris to Lis</strong><br>We all have tremendous ambition for the Greater Manchester region and want to see a transport infrastructure that benefits our economy, our environment and the whole community. </p> <p>To begin with, I would strongly challenge the idea that we have a congestion crisis. Our council's transport unit figures clearly show that traffic volumes have not increased on A or B roads over the past decade. As someone who has been driving towards the city centre most days for the last 10 years, I can vouch for this personally. We all have a role to play in managing congestion at pinch points, but introducing the world's largest congestion charging scheme is not, in my opinion, appropriate for Manchester and simply will not be effective. </p> <p>The proposed scheme will be 10 times larger than the original London zone and a clear analysis of the TIF bid shows that the improvements will be too thinly spread and too focused on the city centre to make public transport a real, door-to-door alternative to the car for most people. Taking the example of <a href=\"http://www.hydesbrewery.co.uk/\">Hydes Brewery</a>, there is very limited transport benefit to the majority of our employees, but 60 people who work at the brewery will be expected to pay \u00a31,200 a year to drive to work. Many of these people are on average wages and this charge would deprive them of a substantial proportion of their disposable income. </p> <p>The proposed scheme is also very arbitrary in its structure. A Hydes employee driving in from Sale would pay \u00a31,200 a year, whereas an employee driving a similar distance, and through the city centre to work, would potentially pay nothing. </p> <p>I am intrigued by your claim that 9 out of 10 people will not pay the charge. Perhaps you could explain this in a little more detail? </p> <p><strong>Lis to Chris</strong><br>I am delighted that you share our ambition for a transport infrastructure that ensures the future of Greater Manchester. We should all be working towards this end. However I cannot agree with your comment regarding congestion. </p> <p>Despite investing half a billion pounds on the M60 and the inner relief road over the last decade, specifically to take traffic from the A and B roads, the <a href=\"http://www.unitedcity.co.uk/downloads/media/roadstats07tsc.pdf\">latest research (pdf)</a> (see p 72) from the DfT has detailed how Greater Manchester's A and B roads have the slowest average rush-hour speeds in England. This fact is coupled with a public transport system already operating over capacity at peak times. Our inadequate transport network will make Greater Manchester an ever more expensive place in which to live and work, and will make us steadily less competitive than our rivals to international investors.</p> <p>The argument that this is a much larger scheme than London shows a failure to engage with and understand the nature of the Manchester proposals.</p> <p>The proposal charges about the same number of people as London's scheme but charges them much less \u2013 typically \u00a31 or \u00a32 rather than \u00a38.</p> <p>It is the shape it is, picking up traffic coming off the M60, and limited to peak times only, because it is a charge on congestion and it picks up congestion where and when it is at its worst. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.gmpte.com/\">Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive</a> (GMPTE) has demonstrated that the scheme they have designed, two charging rings but with no charge to drive within rings, is the most fair and effective type of charge to tackle congestion. </p> <p>The location of the charging rings is also guided by how our region's road network is used. The M60 ring road is a vital road for Greater Manchester, linking the 10 districts with each other, the airport and the national motorway network. Additionally, the inner charging ring will contribute to keeping the main arterial routes into Manchester city centre \u2013 the economic driver of the whole of the north-west \u2013 moving efficiently. </p> <p>Tackling congestion where and when it is at its worst and where it has the greatest business, environmental and personal cost \u2013 and only after extra trains, trams, buses and park and ride sites have been put in place \u2013 seems the fairest way of constructing a charge to me. You'll note that the <a href=\"http://centreforcities.typepad.com/centre_for_cities/2008/09/londons-deputy-mayor-hints-at-congestion-charge-review.html\">deputy mayor of London</a> agrees with this and is exploring using the Manchester scheme as a model for changes to London's charge.<br> <a href=\"http://www.gmfuturetransport.co.uk/pdf/funding_080808.pdf\">GMPTE research (pdf)</a> (see para 1.3) details how 9 out of 10 people will not pay a charge. Of those who do pay, far more will pay \u00a31 or \u00a32 a day than will pay the full \u00a35 charge. Transport figures show roughly 20,000 people will pay a full charge to drive from outside the M60 to work in the city centre \u2013 I would suggest that most of these journeys are made by well-paid workers rather than those employees on low wages.<br> It is the lowest paid workers \u2013 shift workers, part-time employees, and the local business staff of Greater Manchester who have most to gain from the huge \u00a33bn TIF investment package. I note also that Chris Wermann, as a <a href=\"http://www.gmmgroup.co.uk/\">spokesman</a> for GMMG <a href=\"http://www.how-do.co.uk/north-west-media-news/weekly-wrap/how%11do-weekly-wrap-%11-18-april-2008-%11-chris-wermann-200804182397/\">recently said</a>: \"Do we need to tackle the congestion? Absolutely. Do we need to tackle the implications of congestion on the environment? Absolutely.\" <br> I agree with him!</p> <p><strong>Chris to Lis</strong><br>It's good that you agree with Chris Wermann; I do too. His view is that we do need to tackle congestion but that the proposed TIF bid and congestion charge is not the right way to do it.  Your comments regarding the DfT's latest research are interesting. As I understand it this research doesn't use time-series data (its data is only for one year, not year-on-year like the <a href=\"http://www.agma.gov.uk/ccm/agma/Units/GreaterManchesterTransportationUnit.en;jsessionid=A56A018C7CDBE45A38D8987F2A4C0956\">Greater Manchester Transport Unit</a>'s data) so it's hard to argue the congestion itself is actually worsening. What we do know, through GMTU's own figures, is that traffic has slowed, although volumes have not increased on A and B roads. The DfT data also shows slower traffic off peak as well as at peak times, which suggests, in fact, that we need to look at how we better manage traffic flows. <br> I agree that we all want to see public transport improvements, but simply not funded by charging ordinary people on ordinary salaries to drive when public transport doesn't provide a sensible option. The 80sq mile size of the scheme <em>is</em> absolutely critical \u2013 it is seven times bigger than Stockholm's scheme and zones in Singapore and Rome are no more than 3sq miles. <br> Beyond this, the TIF bid documents focus strongly on journeys into and out of the city centre. We know schemes work where public transport is a viable alternative to the car. Given the focus and scale of the proposed Manchester scheme, this won't be the case. For many of my staff, getting to work via the city centre will mean a very lengthy journey on several forms of public transport taking up to an hour-and-a-half, versus just 30 minutes in the car. This just isn't common sense. As you point out and all our GMMG members would say, we need to tackle congestion \u2013 but effectively where it occurs, not through an arbitrary 80-mile zone. The current proposals will make Manchester a more expensive place to work and live, in turn making us a less attractive to investors than other northern cities. It also sadly prices the lowest-paid workers off the roads, without providing a sensible alternative for the majority of them. I inevitably view this from my position as MD at Hydes Brewery. From the perspective of running a business located on the borders of Moss Side and Hulme, it is hard to see that the proposed solution works. The public transport improvements do not represent a practical commuting option for the majority of our employees. What the proposal would do is to charge them, generally \u00a31,200 a year, to travel to work. If they pay this personally it will absorb a large amount of their disposable income and it will encourage them to seek work outside the M60 to avoid the cost. Hydes would lose good quality people with relevant skills and experience and would be at a disadvantage in recruiting replacements. Alternatively, the company could pay the congestion charge on behalf of employees, but this would damage our competitiveness and would not encourage the behavioural changes that the charge is designed to achieve. I do struggle to see how these proposals can be viewed positively by Hydes Brewery or by many of our employees. It's certainly not the case that only 1 in 10 of those who work here would have to pay the charge \u2013 quite the reverse. I would appreciate your comments, as requested in my first email, on the arbitrary nature of the charging scheme and some further explanation of your claim that 9 out of 10 people will not pay the charge \u2013 what does this mean? Does it relate to the whole population of Greater Manchester? Does it include children? </p> <p><strong>Lis to Chris</strong><br>I am afraid that the only thing I agree with your colleague on is the need to tackle congestion and, with no disrespect to yourself, I am constantly confused by GMMG's position with regard to congestion in Manchester. In one email you accept that there is a problem, yet in another you argue that there is no congestion in Manchester.</p> <p>Congestion <em>is</em> a problem for our economy, for our quality of life and for our environment. And it is getting worse. Traffic speeds <em>are</em> slowing, year on year. Over the last 10 years they have slowed by an average of 2.5% each year \u2013 despite the road-building programme described earlier. We need to act.</p> <p>You continue to use the word \"zone\" as if the proposals for Manchester follow London. This is not the case \u2013 indeed Boris Johnson's team in London is exploring the possibility of a Greater Manchester type as a fairer model than the London charge.</p> <p>The Greater Manchester model catches congestion at precisely the places and times it causes the greatest cost to our economy and impact on our lives (just as you argue it should do). It does not operate at times and places where traffic does not have this negative impact. So it only operates between 07.00am and 09.30am coming into Manchester, and between 16.00pm and 18.30pm for drivers heading away from the city.</p> <p>It is this design that means that 9 out of 10 people will not pay a charge. You will not pay a charge if you drive within Bolton. You will not pay a charge if you drive from Rochdale to OIdham. You will not pay a charge if you drive outwards in the morning and inwards in the evening. You will not pay a charge if you drive on the M60. You will not pay a charge if you go shopping at the Trafford Centre or the city centre outside of peak times. And you most certainly will not pay a charge if you are one of the 30% of Greater Manchester residents who do not have access to a car.</p> <p>The transport proposals go far beyond trips to the city centre. I myself am looking forward to a revitalised bus service, built around town centres, as much as the city centre. At long last the bus route from my street to the airport and its bus/rail station will be reinstated.</p> <p>It is ridiculous to say that the investment is city-centre based \u2013 lines run both ways. The proposed Metrolink line to the Trafford Centre potentially takes people away from the city centre but overall is good for the region's economy. Trams running into the hearts of Oldham and Rochdale are not just proposed to make trips easier to Manchester \u2013 they provide an economic lifeline to our towns. New bus links between our district centres (including new non-stop cross-city routes), running at the times they are needed, are desperately required to help stimulate local economic activity. All these proposals, and much more within the TIF bid, are enthusiastically backed by the local councils, because they have the potential to revitalise those town centres that have suffered from the economic drain of out-of-town retail over the last decade. And there is simply no alternative to accessing the scale of transport investment that Greater Manchester requires.</p> <p>Only 2% of peak time drivers will pay the full charge. How much of GMMG's publicity focuses on that cost \u2013 and how much mentions the transformation of our transport system?</p> <p>The alternative to TIF is a transport network operating over capacity \u2013 roads at a standstill for several hours each day, unreliable deliveries and employee journeys, haulage patterns dictated by road congestion, a shrinking employee pool. That is a business environment that will drive companies and investment away from Greater Manchester unless we act decisively now. We cannot just bury our heads in the sand and pretend there is no congestion.</p> <p><strong>Chris to Lis</strong><br>Your first sentence misrepresents my comments, I didn't say there was no congestion problem, but was rather responding to your claim that there was a \"congestion <em>crisis</em>\". A dictionary definition of crisis is \"decisive moment; time of acute danger or difficulty\" and I would not accept that we have reached such a point in Greater Manchester.</p> <p>We do need to take action at congestion pinch points, but we do not need to take the dramatic and irreversible action that is currently proposed. In fact, common sense tells us the proposals will create more congestion pinch points. For example, many people who live inside the M60 will not use it as a means of circumventing congestion and taking the pressure off the local roads \u2013 something AGMA and GMPTE have encouraged for years! \u2013 because taking it means they will be charged for re-entering the outer zone. </p> <p>Everyone in the region would welcome the proposed public transport improvements, but the congestion charge scheme is not the way to fund them. It represents a charging lottery based on where you happen to live and work. Your response completely fails to address the issue of ordinary people on ordinary salaries being charged \u00a31,200 a year to drive to work, when they will be offered no practical alternative. There are 28,000 businesses inside the M60. You contend that only 20,000 people will pay \u00a35 a day to drive from outside the M60 to work in the city centre and that most of these journeys are made by well paid workers. This contention ignores the fact that the inner charging ring is not just the city centre. It includes areas such as Hulme, Moss Side and parts of Salford; hardly \"fat cat\" locations; in fact, 130,000 people work within the inner ring. Hydes employees are generally on \"ordinary\" salaries and can ill-afford to pay \u00a31,200 a year. Many thousands more will face charges of \u00a3700 a year just to cross the M60 to get to work.</p> <p>These proposals will damage the competitiveness of Hydes Brewery, a long-established local business, and thousands of others located within the M60. You place great emphasis on the economic benefits of the proposals, but appear completely blind to the adverse impact they will have on many companies.</p> <p>You argue the investment is not city centre based because the lines run both ways! Of course they do, but the size of the charging area cannot be overlooked so easily. The public transport improvements do not deliver point-to-point connectivity throughout the inner M60 area and therefore do not provide real alternatives to car travel for many commuters. How do you expect employees at Hydes to get to the brewery on Moss Lane West from locations such as Stalybridge, Liverpool, Warrington, Wilmslow and Whaley Bridge in a reasonable time using public transport? In virtually every case they would need to travel into the city centre and back out again \u2013 doubling the lengths of their journeys and more.</p> <p>I requested a brief explanation of what the \"wevoteyes\" claim that 9 out of 10 people won't pay the charge actually means. This was for my benefit and that of other readers of this exchange of views. Posting the 16-page funding and finance supporting paper as the response in your second email wasn't really that helpful. Your further comments in your latest response are also confusing. Surely a claim that is so central to your advertising campaign can be explained in a sentence or two within your next response. Are you saying that <a href=\"http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/s/1061970_ccharge_only_10_will_pay\">only 10% of adults</a> resident in Greater Manchester will ever pay the congestion charge, as the claim implies? </p> <p>To sum up, of course we should take action to tackle congestion, but the proposed solution creates as many issues as it solves. It would improve business prospects in some areas, but do great damage to the competitiveness of many companies. It would benefit some people, but at a significant personal cost to others. I do not accept the \"vote yes\" mantra that there are no alternatives. They simply haven't been explored in Greater Manchester; as Peter Smith has claimed, it's <a href=\"http://www.24dash.com/news/communities/2008-07-25-Manchester-public-to-vote-on-congestion-charge-plans\">this bid or nothing</a>. That can't be the best way to meet our long-term transport strategy needs.</p> <p><strong>Lis to Chris</strong><br>Your dictionary definition of crisis is spot on \u2013 a \"decisive moment\" is exactly the point we are at. The Transport Innovation Fund has provided a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to address two of Greater Manchester's weaknesses \u2013 an inadequate public transport network and increasing congestion. Our region has a proud history of recognising opportunities and of maximising them \u2013 harnessing a damp atmosphere to create a textile industry, the first public libraries, the Manchester Ship Canal. The 2002 Commonwealth Games and the aftermath of the IRA bomb are two more recent examples. There is also a very strong track record of the public and private sectors working together in these situations to achieve the best possible outcomes for the local economy. That is why I have such difficulty in understanding your current position regarding the transport referendum \u2013 and it is why I agreed to take up the (unpaid) position of chair of the yes campaign. If the motivation of the opposition were to undermine local democracy, to damage the future prosperity of the region or to ensure the continuing problems of the less well off in our communities, then the current stance would be understandable \u2013 and sadly there are some who wish to do exactly that. However, you have made it very clear that \"you all have tremendous ambition for the Greater Manchester region and want to see a transport infrastructure that benefits our economy, our environment and the whole community\". I am at a complete loss to see how you have come to the decision that actively encouraging a no vote in the forthcoming referendum will achieve any of those objectives. The outcome of a no vote is very clear \u2013 Greater Manchester will not get the additional funding needed to transform its public transport system. It is as simple as that \u2013 there is no alternative route, no two bites at the cherry, no chance to go back to the drawing board. In one fell swoop the opponents of the TIF proposals will have done untold damage to our economy, our environment and the whole community \u2013 and gifted the funding to rival cities and regions in the UK. That is why there have been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/sep/17/localgovernment.congestioncharging\">articles in the national press</a> stating that a no vote will be a disaster for the region and why other places are rubbing their hands in glee at the possibility of the money coming their way.<br> If we do not act now, frankly Hydes will simply not be able to employ people from Liverpool, Warrington and Whaley Bridge because the daily commute will take too long. That is the ultimate problem Greater Manchester faces: lengthening commuting times, public transport operating above capacity and, on the back of this, a shrinking labour pool. That is the reality we face if we vote no. As for your request for an explanation of 9 out of 10, I provided the link to the paper to ensure that you and other readers had detailed information on how few people would pay the charge. GMMG has always claimed this information has not been published. It has and you now have it in full.  I have enjoyed our exchange of emails and hope we meet in person over the coming weeks. In the meantime I would ask you and your colleagues to reflect on my words above and think carefully about the wisdom of your current strategy. I cannot believe that you really want to leave Greater Manchester in the inevitable future position where congestion charging will be imposed upon us without any massive investment in transport improvements.</p> <p><strong>Chris to Lis</strong><br>We are indeed at a decisive moment and I hope the people of Greater Manchester make the right decision in the referendum later this year. I do not share your view that the introduction of the world's largest congestion charging scheme in any way ranks alongside the development of the textile industry, the building of the Manchester Ship Canal and the staging of the 2002 Commonwealth Games. This is simply a revenue-raising scheme linked to ill-considered proposals that will fail to make public transport a real alternative to the car for most people in our region. Your response is rather emotional, so I would like to bring you back to the facts and sum up with some pivotal points and still unanswered questions: \u0095 The TIF funding document you supplied does not explain the \"9 out of 10 won't pay the congestion charge\" claim \u2013 this question, which I posed to you three times, remains unanswered. Readers will draw their own conclusions.</p> <p>\u0095 Traffic flows on our A roads have not increased in 15 years, but traffic speeds <em>are</em> slower. So how do you rationalise the world's largest congestion charging scheme, when congestion hasn't actually increased? For me, we must simply manage traffic more effectively.</p> <p>\u0095 Other cities will not \"rub their hands in glee\" if we turn down TIF funds \u2013 Birmingham rejected TIF proposals, Cambridge followed after public consultation and Edinburgh voted \"no\" to congestion charging in a public referendum. </p> <p>\u0095 The outcome of a no vote does not mean we won't make transport improvements, although I think the current plan delivers very poor value for money across our 10 boroughs. There are many ways of funding them; we just haven't done the people of Greater Manchester the service of fully exploring them. Council leader Lord Peter Smith stated recently that we accept this proposal or nothing. That doesn't strike me as an acceptable position, not when we are facing a debt of \u00a31.2bn that will take 30 years to pay back.<br> You state that \" If we do not act now, frankly Hydes will simply not be able to employ people from Liverpool, Warrington and Whaley Bridge\" so we do have one point of agreement, you are spot on. But we need to act now to secure a no vote. Otherwise, Hydes may well lose high-quality people from these locations who will be unable or unwilling to sacrifice a large proportion of their disposable income to the congestion charge or to pay the high cost of the public transport alternatives that would see them spending three or four hours a day travelling to and from work! Provided these proposals are rejected, I have no doubt that these people will continue to work successfully within our business for many years to come. This brings me on to my final point. I am staggered you imply that those campaigning for a no vote are undermining local democracy. We are simply offering alternative views to your own \u2013 surely that <em>is</em> democracy? Our views were formed after clear and detailed analysis of all the TIF bid documentation and are based on a commonsense understanding of our own environment and the everyday lives and needs of our employees \u2013 ordinary people on ordinary wages. <br> Early in this process a number of companies with serious concerns made repeated attempts to engage with our authorities about the TIF proposals and to contribute to their development. They ran into the \"no alternative, no plan B\" rhetoric that you continue to play on. As a result The Greater Manchester Momentum Group formed and campaigned actively for a referendum. This will provide an opportunity for everyone to make an <em>informed</em> decision on these far-reaching proposals and vote accordingly \u2013 the purest form of democracy. Needless to say, we will scrutinise the wording of the question intensely over the coming weeks. <br> Saying no requires courage, the courage our city is indeed founded on. We must now have the courage to say no to a bad scheme, and the commitment to work together to explore every alternative as we create a long-term transport plan. I'm sure this will involve vigorously debating plans A, B and C along the way. At this \"decisive moment\" we have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make the right decision about what amounts to one set of poor proposals and get back to the drawing board to create plans that really will reflect the needs of our economy, our environment and our whole community.</p>",
  "<h2>Dark Materials</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/philippullman\">Philip Pullman</a>'s His Dark Materials (1995-2000) comprises three big books that explore a fantastic parallel world. Nothing new there - these tomes can be placed alongside <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/jrrtolkien\">JRR Tolkien</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/cslewis\">CS Lewis</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/jkrowling\">JK Rowling</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/harrypotter\">Harry Potter franchise</a>. Weirdly, all these <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books\">books</a> were made into big <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film\">films</a> at the beginning of the twenty-first century.</p> <p>Obviously, this coincidence may be explained by the tendency of big money to go towards generic product in the film industry. The global success of one film immediately sets producers looking for something similar; and thus a genre is born. The advent of computer-generated special effects also played a key role in facilitating the plausible creation of lavish fantasy worlds.</p> <p>In America the first of the books was called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/121987/golden.compass\">The Golden Compass</a>. British readers may be more familiar with the title Northern Lights. The film version of the first book took its name from the American publication.</p> <p>The books and films also tapped into a widespread millennial anxiety about the real value of life, work and everything in between. These millennial musings were prompted by mounting evidence of ecological disaster, economic decadence and social inequality. With hindsight this kind of cultural production acts as a powerful indicator of hell-in-a-handcart social debauch. No one can say that we weren't warned.</p> <p>Pullman is drawing on a tradition of romantic fatalism that questions the role and value of rationalism in human affairs. Historically, this has generally been understood as a criticism of science and technology and, at the same time, as an appeal for a return to a more authentic, or real, emotional intelligence. Famously, these themes were explored in the romantic horror story Frankenstein.</p> <p>One of the most appealing aspects of Pullman's trilogy is the special type of technology that underpins each of the stories. In Northern Lights, Pullman introduces the alethiometer. This is a dialled instrument that provides answers to various questions \u2013 a sort of portable oracle. The instrument can only be used by the gifted and the answers it gives are usually obscure.</p> <p>In later books, Pullman introduces the Subtle Knife, which cuts between time and space and, finally, the Amber Spy Glass.</p> <p>In the film the alethiometer is visualised as an instrument from the beginning of the scientific revolution. The emotional and interpretive aspects of the machine connect to a shamanistic and pre-scientific understanding of the world and its meanings.</p> <p>Elsewhere in the book there are narrow boats, blimps and devilish mechanical insects. This world is not some simple throw-back to a Luddite pre-industrial arcadia: it is an alternative scientific and industrial world.</p> <p>In the poster this technological historicism is shown through the combination of balloon flying machine and wild-west style armament. This combination is not actually as unusual as it seems. It's a well-established genre in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/sciencefictionfantasyandhorror\">fantasy fiction</a> known as steampunk.</p> <h2>Steampunk</h2> <p>The genre emerged during the second half of the 1980s. It began as science-fiction writers rediscovered the pioneers of the genre: Jules Verne and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/hgwells\">HG Wells</a>.</p> <p>Jules Verne had already explored, in the light-hearted story Around the World in Eighty Days, the idea of a technologically enabled world constructed from a multitude of separate, but interconnected, parts. For Phileas Fogg the world could be circumnavigated through train timetables and shipping schedules. Verne was writing in the 1870s when relatively few people had this understanding of the world as an elaborately mechanistic system.</p> <p>The steampunk genre evolved to explore a society where Victorian engineering and industrial organisation had developed in sophistication without reaching the solid-state electronics of the 20th century. The genre was predicated, in some way, on the success of Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine.</p> <p>The Analytical Engine was conceptualised as the first programmable computer. It was the second of Babbage's great calculating engines. For reasons of money and personality, the first machine remained largely unrealised. The second engine remains one of the great might-have-beens of the Victorian age.</p> <p>For steampunks, the Babbage machines are part of a mechanical organisation of society. This organisation extends beyond the material culture of Victorian Britain and to the conceptual framework of society. The sociology of steampunk devolves from Adam Smith and Jeremy Bentham, as much as from Babbage. The atomisation implicit in the specialisation of labour is extended by the development of Bentham's panoptic vision to become an organising principle of social control.</p> <p>The successful development of Babbage's machines would have allowed for data processing, implicit in panoptic control, to be carried out successfully. So, discipline and control are the forces against which the protagonists of steampunk battle.</p> <p>In steampunk worlds, this struggle is played out against a backdrop of brass-bound mahogany and polished brass, club chairs, steam railways and blimps. The nostalgic luxury of these things distinguishes this particular dystopia from its variants in Nineteen Eighty-Four, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/76627/blade.runner\">Blade Runner</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/92062/minority.report\">Minority Report</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/77528/matrix\">The Matrix</a>.</p> <p>Of course for Pullman, the panoptic control of The Golden Compass, goes far beyond the material conditions of everyday life. In the film, control is enforced through the devilish personality of Mrs Coulter, played by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/nicolekidman\">Nicole Kidman</a>. Mrs Coulter works for the General Oblation Board who are experimentalists working for the Magisterium. They marshal resources and mobilise force, through secret knowledge, to exercise their political will to power.</p>",
  "<p>I was headed into my local grocer in Durham, <a href=\"http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/nchome\">North Carolina</a> last weekend when I saw a startling sight. A pickup truck of early 1990s era was in the carpark, and scrawled across the side of it in big, carefully-lettered permanent marker were the words \"Southern White Hard-Working Beer-Drinking Gun-Owning White Man In His 50s FOR OBAMA!\", with the last two words <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/16/race-wedge-issues-fall-fl_n_135245.html\">drawn about eighteen inches high</a>.</p> <p>Now, it isn't uncommon for a man to deface his beloved pickup truck in the South, especially when he is passionate about a cause. This isn't to say that we don't revere the iconic pick-up truck much the way that some nomads revere horses or camels. It's as much an economic issue as anything \u2013 a man with a pick-up truck won't starve, ever. But as such, most truck-owning Southerners treat their vehicles like prized thoroughbreds \u2013 it takes a lot to bring a man to voluntarily deface it. When it does happen, it is a bold and powerful statement to the community.</p> <p>Usually a Nascar racing team is involved, or a local government agency who he feels has targeted him unfairly. Ex-wives frequently crop up on the sides of trucks \u2013 as do their lawyers \u2013 and especially after September 11, global Islamic terrorists and our war-weary troops have been the favourite subjects. And religious verse and iconography are not infrequent, either. Pickup trucks in the South are a kind of rolling marginalia, an eight-cylinder object d'art, a practical exercise of free speech on big tires.</p> <p>So when a Southern white man defaces his white truck in the name of an African American candidate for office \u2013 favourably \u2013 that is indeed worthy of note by us casual \"pickup truck spotters\".</p> <p>Admittedly, we are in a solidly-Democratic city with a large African-American population, with one of the <a href=\"http://www.duke.edu/\">most liberal private universities in the nation</a> and the South's second highest lesbian population. If you travel 50 miles in any direction from Durham, you emerge into the \"real\" rural South, famed in song, story and film for its quaint cultural attitudes, casual violence, extreme politeness and devout religious piety. And, of course, its racial insecurity.</p> <p>Race intrudes in just about every aspect of life in the American south that it becomes part of the atmosphere, like the water in a fishtank. I didn't really understand that myself until I traveled beyond the South and realized the difference. Once upon a time it would have been nigh unthinkable for a white man, no matter how liberal, to voice support for an African-American political candidate - period. After 30 years of consistent jabbing at the old Southern social order, such things are more common today. The \"Age of Obama\" has helped shake up the last vestiges of the old regime, however, and as we approach Election Day it's easy to see how the casual racism that used to be so overt in Dixie can be so easily exhumed.</p> <p>The danger to the Obama campaign in the South has always been racial in nature \u2013 and his campaign has done its best to distance itself from the traditional southern African American political machines (which are just as corrupt and effective as the white Republican political machines) while still energizing the base they represent. It's been a delicate dance, and one made harder by his middle name and African heritage. Militant \"Black Muslims\" have always been a boogey-man to ignorant white voters in the South, and damning Obama by implication is second nature to his opponents here. They nearly salivated over the inflammatory Jeremiah Wright video, figuring it was an open-and-shut condemnation that would keep the region safely red this year.</p> <p>Not so fast.</p> <p>The race card has been continuously played here for 200 years, now, and used to effect political change, usually by wealthy white people. It has led to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington_Insurrection_of_1898\">only successful coup d'etat in American history</a>, the deaths of thousands by lynching, the disenfranchisement of a good 20% of the population, and a racially-based caste system that took decades to overthrow. Today it leaves behind a residue that is all-too-apparent in this presidential race.</p> <p>Sometimes it's blatant. \"You're just supporting Obama because of white guilt,\" one woman of my parents' generation accuses me. \"They are trying to make you feel bad because of slavery!\" she whines. She's voted Democratic in every election I've voted in, but she's suddenly become a conservative Republican, now that McCain is facing a black man. My protests about the race-neutral issue of a trillion dollars spent on our foreign wars meaning more to me than four centuries of racial injustice fall on deaf ears. To her, the only reason a sane white Southerner would ever support an African American for president is because of racial guilt.</p> <p>Sometimes it's slightly more subtle. Another lady from my church, one I privately called \"the Right Arm Of God\" - not because of her observed piety, I should probably point out, but for her excessive zeal in protecting her daughter's virtue - is upset that I've been vocal in support of Obama in public where people can see. \"I hope you'll use that intellect to get the right man elected,\" she cautions me. I don't need to be a genius to figure out what she means.</p> <p>But sometimes you find relief from the ignorance in unexpected places. Like when my brother-in-law, a deputy sheriff, epitome of Southern conservative power, pulled into my driveway and nodded to my Obama sticker. \"I'm gonna vote for that sumb*tch,\" he expressed, colourfully. \"Looks like McCain's gonna be another term for George Bush, and I'd rather vote for a damn Muslim negro than that.\" And no, he didn't use the word \"negro\". It was the same day I saw that pick-up truck with the proud pro-Obama message.</p> <p>Baby steps.</p>",
  "<p>Time and again, parents tell us what they want for their children is a good local school they do not have to travel far to.</p> <p>We hear stories of families just trying to get the best for their children.</p> <p>Close proximity means children can participate in extra-curricular and social activities, enhancing their experience. </p> <p>Parents also want a school that suits their child's individual needs, be they academic or pastoral, of faith, disability, or gender. There is no 'one size fits all' school; a 'good' school is a school that can meet the needs of the individual child.</p> <p>Here at the Advisory Centre for Education (ACE), we sometimes feel like we're living in a parallel universe. </p> <p>We take in reports on the school admissions and appeals process, but they do not reflect the stories that we hear from parents and carers on our advice lines. </p> <p>Unfortunately, the perpetuation of the myth of choice, and an increasing number of schools with control over their own admissions policy, leads to a more complicated system for parents. </p> <p>Since 2008, school admissions and appeals codes have tried to set up a fairer, more transparent system. The government is trying to satisfy need, but whatever system you have, there will be winners and losers. </p> <p>Those who get the school place they want will think the system works. Those who don't, understandably, blame the system.</p> <p>As part of my role I train local authority and school staff, appeal panel members and clerks. I have sat as a clerk for hundreds of appeals. I am also the mother of two boys, now safely ensconced in secondary school. So I speak as someone who has experienced the admissions process from both ends of the advice line. <br> School admission is not a fiefdom of middle class parents with bright children. </p> <p>It is an issue for looked after children. It impacts on parents of children with special educational needs and disabilities who are desperately trying to find appropriate educational provision. </p> <p>It is a struggle for homeless or refugee families who must negotiate the system on top of all the other adaptations they have to make to family life. </p> <p>Service personnel, recently returned to the country, and looking for housing and schools for their families, are challenged by the process. </p> <h2>What parents should do</h2> <p>Firstly, remember that despite everything that is said about 'choice', you do NOT have a right to choose a school for your child. </p> <p>You do however have a right to state your preference for the school you would like your child to attend, and to give your reasons for this stated preference. </p> <p>If there are more people applying for the school than there are places and if other applicants meet the school's published over-subscription criteria more closely than your child does, your application can be refused.<br> Secondly, make sure that you get all the information you need, both at the time of applying for a school place and, if it comes to it, when appealing. Most importantly, visit schools, if possible while children are attending to see what the learning environment is like. Are all children included? Is there a positive atmosphere? Look at the league tables and Ofsted reports \u2013 but remember that these will not tell you the whole picture. </p> <p>Speak to other parents, children and teachers. Most primary schools will arrange meetings to help parents make their decisions around secondary transfer time. The internet is a mine of information, but always be aware that some information and advice may not be accurate, however well-intentioned it is.<br> Thirdly, think about your child's strengths and any potential problem areas they may have. Look at all the possible schools. Where will their strengths be encouraged and their needs be best met? Next, look at the school's admission arrangements and over-subscription criteria. These must be clear, fair, and objective. They must be published in a booklet produced by the local authority where the school is located and provided to you for free. They are usually also available on the local authority website. See how well your child meets these criteria. If she or he does not meet them well, you may be wasting a preference.  Finally, state your preferences and give all your reasons for wanting the particular schools. Remember to submit your application in time. This is very important as late applications may be considered after on time applications and the school may then already be full. </p> <p>If you have any doubts, speak to your local authority admissions section or for secondary transfer, your primary school. Free help and advice is also available from choice advisers and independent charities, such as ACE.<br> And when you've done all of that, get on with the business of living with and enjoying life with your children. \u2022 Ingrid Sutherland is an education consultant at the <a href=\"http://www.ace-ed.org.uk\">Advisory Centre for Education</a> (ACE)</p>",

  "<p>Conventional big-band wisdom is that quite a few of the musicians are supposed to play the same thing at the same time. Django Bates, the British composer now teaching in Copenhagen, encourages as many people as possible to play different things at the same time, and frequently to play off the beat as well. The result not only hangs together, but hurtles dizzyingly, and sometimes hilariously, into space. </p> <p>StoRMChaser, which opened the ongoing F-ire Collective festival at Kings Place, comprises Bates' students from the Copenhagen Rhythmic Music Conservatory, hence the capitals in the name. The repertoire mixes music from this year's Spring Is Here (Shall We Dance?) album, and some old favourites, including Bates' merciless deconstruction of New York New York. The single-set show began with a moderately funny global-meltdown mock-newscast, but just about any of Bates' announcements throughout the show were a lot funnier. </p> <p>Right to Smile, Bates' lateral take on patriotism, spliced martial music into salsa and a string of warped national anthems with glee. \"Do you like rock and roll?' Bates asked the audience. \"Yeaah!\" was the reply. \"Actually,\" he said, shiftily, \"I meant to ask if you like contrapuntal music within a jazz environment.\" </p> <p>The beat then emerged and vanished like a mirage in the following Subjective Hooks, and Fire Brigade (a kind of demented love song) and You Can't Have Everything brought a fiery tenor-sax solo bursting out of the melee, added Bates' boppish tenor-horn improvising to the impact of his scalding keyboard playing, and intensified Swedish singer Josefine Lindstrand's crucial input from unobtrusive melody-anchor to soul-sermoniser. A version of Glenn Miller's In the Mood ruthlessly delivered the smooth tune in different keys, and the decimated New York, New York suggested the city's violent exuberance more than the original ever did.</p>",
  "<p>With fuel prices sky-high and stock prices rock-bottom, energy and economics have inevitably dominated this year's US presidential race.

  "<p>You don't have to wait until next month to read the extra special global edition of morning freesheet Metro International that will be guest edited by <strong>James Blunt</strong>. Oh no.

She was with another man, see, but the man's not losing any sleep because he has got a plan. She caught his eye, as he walked on by, and she could see on his face that he was flying high. Although he doesn't appear to have much of a plan at all, because he has just realised \"I will never be with you\". Blunt's advice?

  "<p>What should we make of the weekend publicity generated by Phil Woolas, Gordon Brown's new immigration minister? Was he finally saying the unsayable, stating the blindingly obvious (his own explanation), or playing fast and loose with inflammatory language on race?</p> <p>Different newspapers, politicians, lobbyists and, of course, voters have come up with different explanations since the MP for Oldham East and Saddleworth \u2013 on the Lancashire slopes of the Pennines \u2013 gave his Saturday morning <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4965568.ece \">interview to the Times</a>.</p> <p>Woolas didn't say anything new in policy terms. When appointing him Gordon Brown told him his job was to raise the profile of existing policy; the points system for skilled non-EU nationals, the integrationist initiatives put in place by his predecessor, Liam Byrne, the practical implementation of \"earned citizenship\" such as English-language competence.</p> <p>But overshadowing the interview was the implication that, if the coming recession proves deeper than some estimates predict (<a href=\"http://www.ey.com/global/content.nsf/UK/Media_-_08_10_20_DC_-_ITEM_Club_Autumn_2008_forecast\">Ernst &amp; Young' s Item Club report</a> today, for instance), then it makes no sense to allow more people into the country searching for work and public services which will become scarcer.</p> <p>Woolas himself said: \"I've been brought in to be tougher and to change perceptions,\" by which he means making it harder for people to come into Britain, cutting the link between the right to work and the right to stay \u2013 that one is potentially significant \u2013 but also what he calls \"being kinder\" to those already here.</p> <p>Predictably, he annoyed the likes of Keith Vaz MP by raising the issues at all: only bound to cause trouble with extremists for immigrant communities, the Labour chair of the home affairs select committee said. The Tories were a bit at sea, variously accusing him of dithering, of being unclear and \u2013 several hours later \u2013 of pinching Conservative policies.</p> <p>And the Daily Mail? It cleverly places itself between the irresponsible Guardian-reading lefties who would let anyone in to camp in your back garden and those nasty BNP types; as pioneered by Bill Clinton and adopted by Tony Blair, the technique is called triangulation. </p> <p>Today it declares that says Woolas did a U-turn on Sunday morning's BBC Politics Show and is guilty of \"Woolly Thinking\" in a policy area in which clarity is vital because it is so \"toxic\".</p> <p>What excites the Mail's leader writer, possibly guided by editor, Paul Dacre, is Woolas's suggestion that ministers will not allow the UK population \u2013 now just over 60 million - to reach the 70 million predicted by Eurostat or the 68 million predicted by Frank Field and Nicholas Soames, two interesting MPs stranded on the political beach by circumstances and their own shortcomings. </p> <p>On radio Vaz facetiously argued that it would be hard to police the nation's bedrooms. What Woolas really means is that net immigration is still too high \u2013 600,000 people entered Britain last year, 200,000 more than left, on the last figures I recall reading. One baby in four is born to immigrant mothers on some counts.</p> <p>With variations, some significant, the pattern is widespread across rich western Europe, where indigenous birth rates have plunged. All sorts of reasons are offered \u2013 ranging from excessive laxity in admissions and visas to the attraction of English and a lack of ID cards \u2013 to explain the pull of Britain. It is certainly not the weather.</p> <p>All the same the sheer numbers are hard to justify, let alone sustain and, even if the Poles and other east Europeans go home as jobs dry up here and the pound depreciates, the government got its predictions badly wrong. Immigrants helped sustain the unsustainable boom, as David Cameron pointed out last week. He was not alone.</p> <p>Woolas would argue that we cannot keep out EU nationals (just watch those French do it! Krys the Polish Plumber is not as popular there as Joe the American plumber is at home) and that the skills-based points system, plus tighter in-and-out border controls are beginning to bite. </p> <p>Foreign nationals will start getting ID cards in late November and there could be a Queen's speech bill imposing more \"earned citizenship\" requirements \u2013 induction courses, that sort of thing - in December.<br>In other words, \"we're on the case.\"</p> <p>We'll see what difference that makes. A lack of data about people leaving the country (for what it's worth I think it was abolished to save money in the mid-90s) is a serious weakness. Visa enforcement is also poor. Yes, a lot of incomers are smart and motivated, but we have obligations to our own citizens too, don't we?</p> <p>At this point Woolas would say \"yes,\" adding \"British jobs for British workers\" of all colours. His Times interview was full of what I will politely call robust common sense about the need to learn English, for veiled Muslim wives to get out and work (\"even if that goes against their culture\"), the need to curb forced marriages (the age of spousal entry is to be raised from 18 to 21) and much else. </p> <p>He even takes a poke at first-cousin marriage as likely to increase disability among children: the risk doubles (to 4.7%) and, if grandparents were also first cousins, it shoots up to a startling 52%, Woolas claimed. I don't say don't do it, but be careful and get screened, he warned.</p> <p>If those figures are true, Woolas seems a touch too liberal for my taste. I don't want to contribute taxes to the cost of raising avoidably disabled children just because some people like to keep sex in the family in a time when science has told them how dangerous that old habit can be.</p> <p>But overall Woolas's tone fits into the Blunkett school of advocacy: he seeks in a no-nonsense way to call a spade a spade, as those whom Blunkett loves to dismiss as Hampstead liberals or \"Guardian-reading liberals\" (Woolas plays the same card) hesitate to do, even though few can now afford to live in Hampstead.</p> <p>What gives Woolas this right \u2013 or confidence? At grammar school in nearby Nelson in the late 60s he encountered the school's first non-white pupil, a Ugandan Asian refugee whom even the teachers (\"I thought it was appalling\") called Banana. </p> <p>The teachers! Can that be true, I wonder? Anyway Woolas joined Labour at 16 (he is now 48) to campaign against \"Paki-bashing\", went down the hill to university in Manchester, read philosophy and became NUS president \u2013 someone has to \u2013 later a GMB union official. He won his highly-marginal seat in 1997 and has moved gently up the promotion ladder towards his new bed of nails.</p> <p>To reinforce his belief that newcomers must not be left isolated or self-isolating Woolas will be contending that it requires action by both immigrants and the host society, as well as by government to give its policies credibility, a word he stresses. </p> <p>Jon Cruddas's complaints that the white working class feels neglected have resonance beyond Dagenham, the minister concedes.</p> <p>But immigrants want a properly enforced immigration policy too, he says, well aware that his majority in Oldham is less than his migrant electorate and that striking a false note would finish him off. Indeed it would. A happy warrior is Woolas, but he will need his flak jacket.</p> <p>\u2022 The headline for this article was changed on the afternoon of publication.</p>",

  "<p>The news that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/20/governmentborrowing-economics\">the UK public finances lurched into a record deficit in September</a> prompted economists to warn that government borrowing will soon escalate even higher.</p> <h2> Howard Archer at Global Insight</h2> <p>\"The September public finances were dreadful, deteriorating even more than expected. This highlights the extremely poor state of the public finances as they are hit by past largesse, the marked economic slowdown, markedly weak housing market activity and prices, rising unemployment and government policy concessions since the March budget. </p> <p>\"Clearly, the chancellor's aim back in the March budget to keep the PSNBR down to \u00a343.0bn in 2008-09 and the current budget deficit down to \u00a310.0bn has been blown out of the water big time. Indeed, at the current rate of deterioration, the PSNBR is on course to hit \u00a362.6bn in 2008-09; and, with the economic downturn deteriorating, the situation is likely to be substantially worse in 2009-10 even without taking into account any costs resulting from the measures taken to support the financial sector.<br> \"Despite the rapidly deteriorating public finances, the chancellor has indicated that he will bring forward some public spending that was planned for 2010-11 to try and boost the economy and create employment now as the risk of extended, deep recession mounts. Mr Darling has also made clear that this will be funded by extra borrowing rather than tax increases as he has stressed that this is not the time to be taking any money out of the economy. \"Even so, the chancellor's room for manoeuvre will be severely limited by the large fiscal deficits and it will make it all the more important that he maps out a way that the public finances can be reined in to a sustainable state over the medium term once the economy is on a sounder footing. Certainly, the next government will face many difficult decisions on the public finances once it assumes power after the next general election.\"</p> <h2>Dominic White at RBS</h2> <p>\"We're starting to see some pretty serious deterioration now. Given we have seen the economy weaken a little bit in the first three quarters, the borrowing is a direct effect of that.</p> <p>\"The worrying thing is we're already starting to see some fairly sizeable borrowing levels now and that's before we've experienced the real brunt of the recession. So these numbers will get even worse over the next six or nine months as you continue to see tax revenues weaken.\"</p> <h2>Paul Dales at Capital Economics</h2> <p>\"It confirms what we pretty much all know now, that borrowing is set to surge and rise dramatically in the current financial year and in the financial years to come. And that's really before we take into account the full impact of the economic slowdown and the government's plans to recapitalise the banking sector, and the chancellor's most recent plans to bring forward some public spending in future years. </p> <p>\"The upshot is we're going to see a really sharp rise in borrowing in the coming years that has to be paid for.\"</p>",
  "<p>Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin's appearance on Saturday Night Live at the weekend saw the long-running NBC comedy show pull in its best ratings for 14 years.</p> <p>Palin's turn on SNL, which opened with comedian Tina Fey doing her impression of the Alaska governor, attracted the NBC show's largest audience since March 1994, when Olympic ice skater Nancy Kerrigan was guest host.</p> <p>SNL was watched by around 17 million viewers at midnight on Saturday, according to the Associated Press.</p> <p>This made SNL the third highest-rated show of the week in the US, behind Dancing with the Stars and CSI.</p> <p>In SNL's opening sketch, Fey was seen answering questions at a spoof news conference - something Palin hasn't done yet - when the vice-presidential nominee walked on the stage. </p> <p>Fey beat a hasty retreat, walking past Palin with a barely perceptible nod - the only time the pair shared the same stage.</p> <p>In an interview yesterday, Palin said: \"I would do that again in a heartbeat. It was the most welcoming and friendly environment that you could imagine. Everyone was so nice, and you know, you have to have a sense of humour through all of this. </p> <p>\"You have to have some levity through this.

  "<p>Last week, in an article about what David Cameron and his circle were thinking about the political consequences of the global financial crisis, <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/torydiary/2008/10/tories-prepare.html\">ConservativeHome</a> reported: \"The Tories are not worried about being largely out of the news.\"</p> <p>I think we can safely discount that theory.<br><br>On Friday Cameron delivered a big, headline-grabbing speech. Yesterday the Tories announced plans for a VAT holiday. Today they're calling for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/oct/20/davidcameron-conservatives\">a tax cut for small businesses</a>. Cameron's already been on the Today programme and, as I write, he's on the BBC News channel. Further policy announcements may come later this week.</p> <p>Oppositions are never happy to be out of the news at the best of times. But when the political environment is changing dramatically, and perceptions of the main parties are in flux, it's more important than ever for the Conservatives to try to shape public opinion.</p> <p>Unfortunately for Cameron, he's got a problem, which Nick Robinson has explained with admirable clarity <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/nickrobinson/\">on his blog</a> this morning.</p> <blockquote> <p>On the banking crisis, he can't say \"I told you so\" because he didn't. He can't say \"We had a better answer\" because he didn't propose one and he's given his backing to the Brown plan.</p> <p>On what looks like a looming recession, he won't say \"Let's cut taxes to stimulate the economy\" - as the American and Australian governments have - because he's already declared that \"the cupboard is bare\" and that as a \"fiscal conservative\" he's not prepared to borrow to finance tax cuts.</p> <p>Thus, he's limited to proposing small-scale policy responses - yesterday a VAT holiday for small businesses, today a short-term tax cut for them - or to saying, like the Irishman in the old joke, \"I wouldn't have started here\".</p> </blockquote> <p>To be fair, Cameron says the Tories can say \"I told you so\" because they have been complaining about levels of debt in the economy. But it's hard to find evidence that they've been warning about lax regulation of the City leading to the near collapse of the global banking system, so Robinson's point is basically sound.</p> <p>Robinson also makes another important observation which, as far as I'm aware, hasn't been made elsewhere.</p> <blockquote> <p>In addition, the prime minister is addicted to his favourite electoral narrative - Labour investment versus Tory cuts - and sees the chance to run it again. Specifically, if - and it is a very big if - the government can bring forward its programme to rebuild schools, that would cut the money which the Tories have allocated for their \"free schools\" programme and allow ministers to ask, \"What would you cut to pay for your plans?\"</p> </blockquote> <p>To add to Cameron's woes, Fraser Nelson at <a href=\"http://www.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2452781/is-camerons-vat-plan-legal.thtml\">Coffee House</a> says the plan for a VAT holiday would be illegal under EU law.

  "<p>To coin a French and Saunders-sounding phrase, you could feel the moistness in the room as Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders ended their press night last week at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane to two thoroughly deserved standing ovations. As brilliant as the show was, I suspect some of the tears were being shed for the passing of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/comedy\">comedy</a> era.</p> <p>In considering their comic legacy, it's worth remembering that when their sketch show debuted in 1987 it was in a very different environment: French and Saunders were allowed \"thinking room\" to develop their talent, a luxury increasingly out of place in an accountancy-led BBC and in an industry with an appetite for Fast Show-style rapid-cut comedy. A funny line is a funny line, but a funny sketch needs more time, in terms of writing, acting and direction, to come good, and the skit that inspired Jennifer Saunders' Absolutely Fabulous series (with French playing Saffy) was 12 minutes long. No producer would dream of allowing that today.</p> <p>Sketch comedy, with its emphasis on collegial rather than individual talent, is where women might be expected to shine and I've noticed in the past few years at the Edinburgh Fringe a growing number of female comics performing as duos. Maybe it's safety in numbers, as the comedy circuit, dominated by male standups, is depressingly, shockingly misogynistic. But the good news is there are some terrific female comedy duos out there.</p> <p>Lynn Chambers and Sally Nettleton, who remind me of the great Morecambe and Wise, are the only female duo working extensively on the circuit; Judith Faultless and Alys Torrance have been around for some time with their daft, madcap humour and deserve a wider audience; Charlotte Hudson and Leila Hackett (as Two Left Hands), dare to do clever, erudite comedy full of literary and classical allusions; and Sarah Adams (once Jade the Folk Singer) and Leisa Rea - two very funny women with a nice line in understated, ironic interplay, who performed for the first time together at this year's Fringe - show enormous potential as a duo.</p> <p>Any list of talented twosomes must include Mel and Sue, perhaps the most obvious inheritors of French and Saunders' mantle - they wrote for F&amp;S early in their careers and, like them, share an offstage friendship that translates into an almost telepathic partnership in front of the camera. I'm told that Mel Giedroyc (currently in <a href=\"http://eurobeatthemusical.com\">Eurobeat</a> in the West End) and Sue Perkins are thinking of working together again next year and I cannot wait.</p> <p>But the best female duo working today is Watson and Oliver. Lorna Watson and Ingrid Oliver's work often has a surreal twist, they play male and female characters, and they don't mind looking daft. Their sketches - of varying lengths and complexity, with the odd visual gag and physical comedy thrown in - are rarely predictable, which shows writing of great originality. I foresee great things for them. If only BBC3 could be persuaded to commission something worth watching for once, it could be \"French and Saunders have left the building, now let's hear it for Watson and Oliver.\"</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/governmentborrowing\">public finances</a> lurched to a record deficit last month driven by a weakening economy and overspending by the government, and analysts say much worse is yet to come as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/recession\">economy tips into recession</a>.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics said that public sector net borrowing came in higher than expected at \u00a38.1bn, a record for a September and way above the \u00a34.8bn shortfall seen in September last year.</p> <p>That left the cumulative PSNB for the first half of the 2008/09 fiscal year at \u00a337.6bn versus \u00a321.5bn in the same period a year ago and the highest since records began in 1946.</p> <p>\"The September public finances were dreadful, deteriorating even more than expected. This highlight the extremely poor state of the public finances as they are hit by past largesse, the marked economic slowdown, markedly weak housing market activity and prices, rising unemployment and government policy concessions since the March budget,\" said Howard Archer, economist at consultancy Global Insight.</p> <p>The cash-based measure known as the public sector net cash requirement also hit a record high for the month of September, of \u00a312.6bn compared with a deficit of \u00a38.7bn in the same month last year. </p> <p>\"It confirms what we pretty much all know now, that borrowing is set to surge and rise dramatically in the current financial year,\" said Paul Dales, an economist at Capital Economics. </p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/budget\">his budget in March</a>, the chancellor, Alistair Darling, forecast a shortfall for the full 2008/09 year to next March of \u00a343bn. But today's figures show that figure has nearly been reached at the half-way stage of the year, meaning he will have to revise that figure sharply higher in next month's pre-budget report.</p> <p>Darling said over the weekend that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/20/economy-recession-treasury-energy-housing\">the government would bring forward some infrastructure projects intended for future years to give a boost to the economy during the downturn</a>. Treasury officials denied that this meant extra spending would result, however.</p> <p>The Ernst &amp; Young Item Club thinktank today became the latest in a line of forecasters to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/20/recession-economy-slump-crunch\">predict a savage widening of the deficit over the next couple of years</a> as recession crimps tax receipts and boosts government spending on welfare payments.</p> <p>Item's chief economist Peter Spencer has pencilled in a deficit of \u00a360bn this year - a record - and \u00a392bn in 2009/10 - equivalent to 6% of gross domestic product.</p> <p>Separately, the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) today reported that gross mortgage lending fell by a further 10.0% to just \u00a317.7bn in September from \u00a319.7bn in August and \u00a324.7bn in July. Gross lending was down 41.7% year on year from \u00a330.4bn in September 2007.</p>",
  "<p>\"Commercially, forests are worth more dead than alive. That's why they fall and that's what we have to change.\" </p> <p>That's the succinct synopsis of Andrew Mitchell, executive director of <a href=\"http://canopycapital.co.uk\">Canopy Capital</a>, and the driving force behind the company's forest-based fund. </p> <p>Its experiment in monetarising the world's forests concentrates on the million-acre Iwokrama Reserve in Guyana. The president of the former British colony has earmarked the reserve for research into sustainable development policies. </p> <p>The future cost of saving forests such as those of Guyana will dwarf the current bail-outs for the financial sector, says Mitchell. \"This is not about markets versus donor funds, it's about an emergency. The economic losses from degrading nature are three times the credit crunch,\" he says. </p> <p>\"We need markets and a new global agreement on the economy but this time with natural capital firmly on the balance sheet.\" </p> <p>Canopy Capital denies that local people will lose out in the market-based system it is proposing. The funds already secured from investors will be used to pursue conservation projects and \"business partnerships\" for Iwokrama's 7,000 residents. </p> <p>\"Paying communities and governments to maintain forests for us, like a global utility benefiting the world, will one day be as natural as paying for your electricity bill,\" says Mitchell. </p>",
  "<p>For anyone eagerly awaiting the next stage in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/russia\">EU-Russia</a> relations, last week's <a href=\"http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-10/16/content_10205382.htm\">European council</a> showed some ankle rather than a whole leg. The <a href=\"http://mnweekly.ru/news/20081016/55351197.html\">conclusions acknowledged</a> Russia's withdrawal from the Georgian \"buffer zones\" adjacent to Abkhazia and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/georgia\">South Ossetia</a>, in line with last August's EU-negotiated peace agreement. But the rest of their thinking was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/17/eu-kosovo-brussels-summit\">put on ice</a>: instead of commenting now, the commission and the council will continue their comprehensive evaluation of EU-Russia relations in advance of the November 14 summit between the two sides. The commission will also consider the feasibility of a new \"Eastern partnership\" between the European Union, Georgia and the Republic of Moldova. It is not necessarily a bad thing that the EU is keeping its powder dry: indeed, it may better prepare Europe to take advantage of a change in the dynamic between Brussels and Moscow, when their negotiators meet. </p> <p>After all, Russia is weaker now than it was two months ago. There are two reasons for this, but they share a bottom line. First, oil prices have fallen, hard. When Russia clashed with Georgia last summer, the price of crude had just peaked at $145 a barrel. By October 15 that price had dropped below $75 for the first time in four years. Oil has recently provided around 30% of the Russian government's income: the recent price drop is a massive loss in prospective revenue. Second, Russia's stock market has taken a pounding. The RTS index dropped 70% between May and October, with losses so sharp and sudden that the Micex has adopted the novel tactic of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/12/russia-stock-markets\">shutting itself down</a> \u2013 sometimes for days at a time \u2013 to stem the flow. Partly due to global economic circumstances, these falls are also down to Russia's trigger-happy adventurism in the Caucasus. On August 7, Russian forces entered Georgia: on August 8, $6bn left Russia. By September 19, another $50bn was gone. Investors don't like wars \u2013 or deviations from the rule of law. </p> <p>In the sober light of economic reality, Medvedev understands that Russia must reassure the markets. To that end, we have seen more biddable behaviour from the Russian government: at least partial adherence to the peace agreement; a presidential speech floating the idea of a new <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/09/russia \">security pact</a> between Moscow and Nato; and open calls for more foreign direct investment from the west. The \u20ac4bn <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/16/banking-iceland\">bail-out for Iceland</a> that Russia is apparently negotiating, and a closer military <a href=\"http://en.rian.ru/russia/20081016/117766697.html\">relationship with Syria</a> are down to Russia's pride on the one hand and its business sense on the other. Moscow is keen to maintain its strong image, but money is the true name of the game and its leaders knows they must therefore come to the table.</p> <p>A new partnership agreement between the EU and Russia is a fine goal in the long term; but first things first. Europe needs to show that it will neither abandon its allies on Russia's border, nor roll over when confronted by bad behaviour from Moscow. To that end, the EU should signal its continued support for an eastern partnership, the refusal of its member states to be part of any new pact that could undermine their security or the future role of Nato, and its expectation that Russia will abide by its commitments to peace. </p> <p>At next month's negotiations, Europeans should also raise the <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/asection/la-fg-poison16-2008oct16,0,5763910.story\">case of Karina Moskalenko</a>, the prominent lawyer representing the family of murdered journalist and human rights activist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/oct/15/anna-politkovskaya-pressandpublishing\">Anna Politkovskaya</a>. Last Monday, she was poisoned with mercury while in her car in Strasbourg. This is strongly reminiscent of the murder of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko, who was poisoned with polonium-210 two years ago in London. While this goes on we cannot talk about \"shared values\" as the Russians want us to: at most we can talk about mutual interests. The Russian leadership must show that it is not only innocent of ordering these crimes, but that it is able and willing to stop them from occurring. </p> <p>Vladimir Putin is the bare-chested tough guy who likes us to know that he can topple billionaire oligarchs, grind Chechen rebels into the dust and reshape the geography of Europe. Don't tell me he can't stop the murders of key activists who just happen to have opposed him publicly.</p>",
  "<h2>Aga</h2> <p>Demand for Aga cookers has gone off the boil in the past few weeks, as the financial crisis deters people from buying a piece of the so-called Aga Saga lifestyle.</p> <p>Aga Rangemaster reported this morning that sales of its high-end cookers have fallen by 15% since August, compared with a year ago when the credit crunch was just beginning. Sales had already been slipping in the summer before the latest turmoil struck. </p> <p>The housing slump is a key factor behind the sales decline - the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2008/oct/20/mortgages-property\">10% drop in mortgage lending in September</a> means less demand for its cast iron beauties.</p> <p>\"Consumer markets are clearly weak and the impact of the macroeconomic environment is being felt,\" said William McGrath, chief executive, who admitted that profits for the second half of 2008 would be \"appreciatively below\" the first six months.</p> <p>This is a much gloomier picture than the company painted at the end of August, when it emphasised its resilience to the crisis. </p> <p>Shares in the company promptly fell by more than 20%, and analysts at Panmure Gordon predicted that Aga's markets would continue to deteriorate. </p> <h2>Davenham</h2> <p>With a business model based on lending to small businesses and property developers, Manchester-based Davenham is being badly squeezed by the downturn. The company cut 20% of its workforce this morning, meaning 43 people are now out of a job, and admitted it would not be profitable this year.</p> <p>It blamed the \"rapidly deteriorating\" economic climate for a rise in bad debts, a trend it expects to continue - especially on the property side as more developers are hit by falling house prices and a lack of buyers. </p> <p>Davenham is now in talks with its banks to possibly revise and extend its loan facilities. </p> <p>Shareholders received a double-whammy - the proposed dividend has been cancelled as a cash-saving measure, and Davenham's shares plummeted 76%.</p> <h2>Marks &amp; Spencer</h2> <p>Having cut back on store refurbishments and new openings, is M&amp;S about to axe jobs at head office? The Daily Telegraph reported this morning that it is consulting with staff in its property and store development arms about the implications of cutting capital expenditure from \u00a3900m to \u00a3700m. With less money to spend and fewer new outlets to launch, the implication is that M&amp;S need fewer heads on the design and development side. </p> <p>Employees affected may be redeployed rather than being laid off. But their mood may not be improved by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/aug/19/marksspencer.retail\">M&amp;S's recent attempt to cut its redundancy payments</a>.</p> <h2>Aldi-Travelodge</h2> <p>But while a recession will push some companies to the wall, others plan to thrive in the tougher climate.</p> <p>Rather than cutting back on expansion plans, Aldi and Travelodge are partnering up to build a series of budget supermarket-hotel hybrids. The first site, in Torquay, will see a 74-room hotel build on top of a 14,000 square foot Aldi store. It's due to open next autumn, while a similar project in Middlesborough should be completed by November.</p> <p>Travelodge's Paul Harvey says the credit crunch means that the hotel chain can snap up development sites that were previously out of reach.</p> <p>\"By developing sites together with Aldi we are sending out a clear signal that the budget sector in the UK is going to make the most of the opportunities presented by the economic downturn,\" Harvey said.</p> <h2>Housebuilders</h2> <p>Taylor Wimpey, Persimmon, Bellway et al already had enough problem before a damning analyst note from Collins Stewart hit our desks today.

  "<p>On paper, the idea looks like a conservation masterstroke. Take a huge swath of pristine rainforest, put a price on the rainfall it produces and other \"services\", and sell these off to rich philanthropists with a conscience.</p> <p>That's precisely the rescue package dreamt up by investment house <a href=\"http://canopycapital.co.uk\">Canopy Capital</a>. And it's working. The London-based firm has persuaded 10 wealthy individuals to buy into the \"ecosystem services\" of Guyana's heavily forested Iwokrama Reserve. </p> <p>The logic is straightforward. Trees need to be worth more standing up than chopped down. Giving them a \"utility value\" is one way of achieving that. </p> <p>\"How can it be that Google's services are worth billions, but those from all the world's rainforests amount to nothing?\" Canopy Capital's director, Hylton Philipson, is fond of saying. </p> <p>Putting a price on trees' services \u2014 climate regulation, biodiversity maintenance and water storage, for example \u2014 is the latest in a long list of market-based measures designed to save Latin America's forests. </p> <p>Governments across the region have bought into ecotourism, forest certification, biodiversity offsets and carbon emission trading in recent years. </p> <p>Market-based mechanisms appeal because they appear a win-win, says Ronnie Hall, coordinator for Global Forest Coalition, an international coalition of environmental groups. </p> <p>\"Governments don't have to dip into the public purse so much, and private investors think they can make a profit out of it \u2026 It's very skewed. In the end, it's all become about money\", she says. </p> <p>As the world's financial markets totter, Latin Americans are wondering if the business theorists haven't hoodwinked them. </p> <p>\"The problems that have been caused by companies with their own rules cannot be solved by the same companies with the same rules,\" says Ana Filippini, spokesperson for the <a href=\"http://www.wrm.org.uy\">World Rainforest Movement</a>, a Uruguayan-based conservation group.</p> <p>Despite millions being poured into sustainable projects in the Amazon, for example, illegal loggers are still hard at work in the world's largest rainforest. Monthly deforestation rates in August were almost three times higher than the same time last year, according to <a href=\"http://www.inpe.br\">Brazil's National Institute for Space Research</a>.</p> <p>Business-based schemes also have a habit of generating unintended consequences. The Global Forest Coalition lists examples in a new report, Life as Commerce: the Impact of Market-based Conservation. </p> <p>Take tree plantations. Under the Kyoto protocol, the carbon captured by so-called carbon sinks can be sold to buyers in developing countries. As a result, companies across the continent have been fighting over themselves to plant fast-growing plantations for the profitable carbon market. </p> <p>The climate change benefits of monoculture plantations, however, are arguably offset by the enormous damage they cause to local biodiversity. </p> <p>In endorsing commercial plantations, timber certification schemes such as the <a href=\"http://www.fsc.org\">Forest Stewardship Council</a> are also cited in the report for doing more harm than good. </p> <p>Market-based schemes fail the residents of Latin America's forests as much as the forests themselves, says the Global Forest Coalition. </p> <p>Often complex and poorly explained, business mechanisms frequently leave local inhabitants sidelined and disenfranchised. </p> <p>In Costa Rica, for example, conflicts have flared up among indigenous groups after individuals in these communities sold medicinal plants to pharmaceutical companies \u2014 a practice known as bioprospecting. </p> <p>Forest communities in Colombia, meanwhile, have reportedly lost control over what trees to plant on their own land after agreeing to participate in a carbon-credit reforestation programme. </p> <p>In some cases, the forests they were regenerating have been reclassified as stubble to make way for timber plantations. </p> <p>\"Although there's a theoretical opportunity for indigenous people, they can't really engage [with market-based schemes] because there's so many hurdles they have to jump,\" says Hall. </p> <p>Just as they have with the financial markets, governments need to step in with a robust rescue plan, says Sergio Leitao, campaign director of <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org/brasil\">Greenpeace Brazil</a>.</p> <p>\"We can't leave such an important subject for the future of the planet as forest preservation in private hands,\" he says. <br> He cites the example of Paraguay, not a country associated with strong public governance. A recent moratorium on deforestation cut illegal logging in the forest-rich state by 83% in one year. </p> <p>Simone Lovera, author of the report, suggests an alternative: leave the forest communities of Latin America to protect their natural habitat. </p> <p>After all, the best-preserved forests today are found on indigenous territories, she points out. \"Indigenous-led conservation initiatives have proven to be very cost-efficient,\" she says.</p> <p>Regrettably, few residents of Latin America's forests are likely to make it to the next round of climate change talks in Poland in December. As business-minded negotiators brush down their suits in preparation, though, the message of cost-efficiency may win them a hearing.</p>",
  "<p>How would you feel if you flew all the way across the Atlantic and some idiot ran you over? That thought may have momentarily passed through the mind of a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Nighthawk\">common nighthawk</a> as it <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/oct/17/wildlife-endangeredspecies \">met its maker</a> on the Isles of Scilly last week, at the hands of a speeding motorist. </p> <p>Some observers claimed that the bird's untimely death was a disaster for the islands' tourist industry, though in fact there are so many <a href=\"http://www.scillybirding.co.uk/\">rare birds from North America on Scilly</a> at the moment that visiting twitchers hardly have time to catch up with them all. </p> <p>The same is true elsewhere \u2013 particularly in mainland Cornwall and south-west Ireland. From Philadelphia vireos to scarlet tanagers, and blackpoll warblers to buff-bellied pipits, exotically-named \"Yanks\" have been arriving by the dozen, as the <a href=\"http://www.birdguides.com/\">Birdguides website</a> reveals. </p> <p>There have even been two coveted \"firsts\" \u2013 a <a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/species/index.html?action=SpcHTMDetails.asp&amp;sid=3707\">little blue heron</a> (actually white, as it was a juvenile bird) in Ireland, and an <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/7662371.stm\">alder flycatcher</a> in Cornwall. This bird is so hard to tell apart from the closely related willow flycatcher that it had to be trapped and examined in the hand before its identity could finally be confirmed.</p> <p>So why have all these birds turned up, and why this particular autumn? It has long been known that North American migrants, which cross the western Atlantic Ocean on their journey south, sometimes get blown off course. The ones that survive their epic oceanic crossing end up on the wrong side of the Atlantic, in Britain and Ireland. The wrong side for them, but very much the right side for the armies of twitchers eagerly awaiting their arrival.</p> <p>In recent years the weather systems that bring these birds to our shores have shifted further north, probably due to the effects of warmer oceans caused by global climate change. As a result, the few recorded American vagrants have mostly been found on remote islands off the north and west of Scotland, such as <a href=\"http://www.foundonfoula.co.uk/\">Foula</a> and St Kilda. But this year the weather patterns have reverted to more \"normal\" ones, with these fast-moving depressions crossing the south-western extremities of the British Isles.</p> <p>So for the old-timers of the twitching fraternity, this autumn has brought a return to the good old days. The unfortunate nighthawk aside, there has been plenty for the \"Scilly season\" regulars to enjoy. Doubtless the evening log-call of rare birds in the Scillonian Club will see heated discussions about whether this is the best year ever \u2013 even better than the fabled autumn of 1985, perhaps. I was on the Isles of Scilly that October, and added nearly 20 new species to my British list, over half of which came from North America. </p> <p>Nowadays, we know that these rarities aren't just arriving here in Britain and Ireland, but on a broad front along Europe's Atlantic seaboard. For the past decade or so, pioneering birders have been <a href=\"http://www.birdwatch.co.uk/website/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=331&amp;Itemid=29\">heading to the Azores</a>, the island archipelago 1,500km to the west of Portugal, where dozens of American vagrants have been found. Not surprising really, given that the islands are almost half way to North America \u2026</p> <p>The editor of <a href=\"http://www.birdwatch.co.uk/website/\">Birdwatch magazine</a>, Dominic Mitchell, led a group of birders to the Azores earlier this month, and found some extraordinary rarities, including a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow-bellied_Sapsucker\">yellow-bellied sapsucker</a> \u2013 a kind of woodpecker, and a really rare bird on this side of the Atlantic. </p> <p>What he considers the best-ever year for American vagrants is, he believes, a result of the exceptional weather experienced in the eastern United States earlier this autumn:</p> <blockquote> <p>American birds are almost expected in any autumn when depressions sweep in from the west, but this year's higher-than-average quota of tropical storms, and the arrival points of the fast-moving low-pressure systems that result, have been particularly fortuitous for birders \u2013 if not for the birds themselves.</p> </blockquote> <p>Ironically, the influx of rare birds has brought exquisite agonies for one keen twitcher. With well over 500 species under his belt, Mark Golley has seen more different kinds of bird in the British Isles than almost anyone. But when the news from south-west England and Ireland broke, he was over 1,500 km away, on <a href=\"http://www.fairislebirdobs.co.uk/\">Fair Isle</a>. He describes his feeling on hearing about countless rare Yanks, while watching two White's thrushes (a very rare bird from Asia), as \"very strange \u2026 elation combined with abject misery\".</p> <p>At least he didn't give in to the urge to head straight back south. But many do: back in the 1980s a group of twitchers made the long journey from Scilly to Fair Isle \u2013 and back \u2013 to twitch three very rare birds. This involved driving through the night, then chartering a plane, at an extortionate cost. This classic twitcher's tale is told in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Best-Days-British-Birds-Ogilvie/dp/0950847135\">Best Days with British Birds</a>. </p> <p>I must admit I used to go twitching occasionally, though I never indulged in such legendary escapades as the Scilly to Shetland marathon. Nowadays, although I occasionally go to see a rare bird in my home county of Somerset, I just can't cope with the tension of twitching. The agonies of missing a rare bird you've travelled hundred of miles to see simply aren't worth it!</p> <p>And if you really want to see American birds, why not take the easy way out \u2013 and go to America? A week at the wonderful <a href=\"http://www.birdcapemay.org/ \">Cape May</a>, a migration hotspot on the southern tip of New Jersey, will cost you about the same as a week on Fair Isle or Scilly \u2013 and believe me, it's much more fun. </p> <p>You may even see a common nighthawk \u2013 and what's more, this time it will probably be alive \u2026</p>",
  "<p>Mortgage lending slumped by 10% in September to its lowest level for more than three-and-a-half years as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/housingmarket\">housing market</a> slowdown stifled demand for new loans, figures showed today.</p> <p>The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) said its members advanced loans worth \u00a317.7bn over the month, a decline of 42% on September 2007. </p> <p>Over the course of 2008 net <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/mortgages\">mortgage</a> lending, which takes into account repayments and redemptions, could fall to around a third of last year's figure, it said.</p> <p>September's gross lending figure is the lowest since January 2005 and reflects a sharp drop-off in loans to new borrowers, as both lenders and buyers pull out of the housing market. The CML said a seasonal fall was typical between August and September, but this was the lowest September figure for seven years.</p> <p>Gross mortgage lending for the three months from July to September was estimated to total \u00a362bn, down 16% on the second quarter of this year and 37% down on the same period last year. </p> <p>Despite the recent moves by the government to free up the mortgage market and reduce the cost of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/debt\">borrowing</a>, mortgage lenders have been increasing the cost of some loans in recent days. </p> <p>Some have also continued to restrict lending, with Nationwide recently pulling its best deals for new and existing borrowers with less than 10% to put down as a deposit. </p> <p>Despite this, the CML's director general, Michael Coogan, insisted: \"The mortgage market is open for business.\" </p> <p>However, he added: \"Weakening consumer demand and ongoing funding constraints will dampen monthly lending figures for the rest of this year and into the first quarter of 2009.\"</p> <p>As a result, Coogan said he expected gross lending over the year to come in at \u00a3255bn compared with last year's figure of \u00a3363bn, while the value of net lending could fall from \u00a3108bn to \u00a340bn.</p> <p>Howard Archer, chief UK economist at Global Insight, described the figures as \"awful\". </p> <p>\"The extremely low level of mortgage activity in September shows that housing market activity continues to be hammered by the highly damaging combination of extremely tight lending conditions and still-stretched buyer affordability,\" he said.</p> <p>Andrew Montlake, a partner at mortgage broker Cobalt Capital, said the figures reflected a \"seismic shift\" in the mortgage market with lenders moving away from the riskiest borrowers. </p> <p>\"Despite the bail-outs that have taken place around the world I expect very little change in the mortgage lending figures for the rest of this year, mainly because the mainstream lenders are only accepting 'quality', low loan-to-value business.\"</p>",
  "<p>With a dozen UK universities standing to lose \u00a377m in collapsed Icelandic banks, the higher education sector appears, along with everyone else, to be facing an uncertain future. But could the global financial downturn in fact spell good fortune for the UK's universities?</p> <p>The evidence from previous recessions is that business schools and universities tend to benefit. In a difficult recruitment situation, people take time out to embark on master's degrees to improve their CV and knowledge while they ride it out, says Jonathan Slack, chief executive of the Association of Business Schools (ABS).</p> <p>\"That certainly happened in the 1980s and 1990s, particularly at master's level where the demand seemed to spike up,\" Slack says. \"You might anticipate a decline in interest for financial programmes in this situation but that hasn't happened.\"</p> <p>Business and management is the most popular subject at degree level and is taken in some form by one in seven students. The findings of a survey by ABS this week show undergraduate demand from home and EU students for business school courses is up, particularly masters of business administration (MBA) courses.</p> <p>\"The numbers taking an MBA course full-time appears to be strong, but part-time is mixed, with some of the 40 schools who responded saying it's OK and others saying numbers have dropped,\" Slack says.</p> <p>Business schools tend to have overseas students from a broader range of countries than universities as a whole, so where the number of Chinese students is tailing off, they are seeing rising interest from oil and gas nations and Pakistan.</p> <p>\"Apart from a few cases where schools are reporting they are not getting the full number of overseas students they were expecting, overall it appears from our survey that there are no major problems.\" Slack says.</p> <p>Postgraduate and specialist master's programmes overall look strong, but numbers on executive level MBA courses are likely to suffer where they are much more closely affected by the uncertain future corporate companies face.</p> <p>\"For universities it's good. The usual thing is that people who become unemployed tend to study to improve their chances in the future,\" agrees Janette Rutterford, professor of financial management at the Open University (OU) business school.</p> <p>She says: \"You typically see increases in the numbers doing MBAs, law and accounting courses as people look for courses that offer tangible qualifications with professional credibility.\"</p> <p>Rutterford says the OU stands to gain in particular because of the nature of the distance learning it offers students. </p> <p>\"You'll see more students studying part-time with jobs to cover themselves. Staying at home and doing an OU degree makes sense,\" she says.</p> <p>MBAs become even more popular in a downturn as they are globally recognised qualifications that show initiative, a global outlook and offer a mixture of the practical and the academic to improve job prospects, Rutterford says.</p> <p>\"There are opportunities,\" she says. \"Universities are also changing the courses they produce and looking at courses that will appeal to people in a recession. We have level 1 courses that people can take as part of a degree course or outside of it.</p> <p>\"Our introduction to business studies course has 2,400 students a year on it and we are looking to turn it into a foundation degree in financial services.\"</p> <p>Universities will also benefit from people wanting to retrain. Manchester Metropolitan may have lost money in the collapse of Iceland's banking system but an open evening for the university's nursing course last week had a \"surprising\" amount of interest from people with a financial background wanting a complete career change.</p> <p>According to Dr Mary Meldrum, head of postgraduate programmes at the university's business school, course numbers are way up this year. Attendance on the master's project management courses is three times higher than expected and courses in human resources management and international business have also seen an increase.</p> <p>She says: \"Project management has taken off this year, I think that's because there are still a lot of jobs in that area and there's a big demand.</p> <p>\"There's been a noticeable growth in UK students, which may be due to difficulties in graduates getting jobs as it's mainly people who are fresh graduates. We've seen a 25% increase in the proportion of UK numbers on last year and overseas numbers are also up.\"</p> <p>The school is launching \"block mode\" MBAs where students can come in for three day courses every few months as there is sufficient demand from people in work who want to protect themselves by getting more qualifications.</p> <p>With increasing numbers of people applying to university, it's clear they still see higher education as a worthwhile investment in their future, says Prof Rick Trainor, president of vice-chancellor's group Universities UK.</p> <p>He says: \"In an economic downturn, investment in research, development and higher-level education by government and private enterprise is more important than ever.</p> <p>\"We know that as the UK economy continues to shift towards knowledge-based activities it is likely that a greater proportion of the workforce will need higher-level skills.</p> <p>The sector, he says, is well placed to produce the workforce needed for a highly skilled knowledge-based economy and to meet the government's target of 40% of the adult population having a higher education qualification.</p> <p>According to Trainor: \"Individuals are likely to need to re-skill at several points in their working lives to keep pace with employer expectations, and remain in the workforce for longer.</p> <p>\"In this future landscape, public policy will need to support the tendency for people to move in and out of study and work, in practical ways.\"</p> <p>But Philip Harding, finance director at the University of Westminster and chair of the British Universities Finance Directors Group (Bufdug), says universities are going to face tough times.</p> <p>\"There's evidence to suggest we're not going to get a generous settlement out of the next spending review so the signs aren't looking good in terms of university finances,\" he says.</p> <p>The general global recession will affect the mobility of overseas students and universities could also see a downturn in their numbers, which a fair number rely on as a substantial part of their income, Harding says.</p> <p>The collapse of stock markets will also increase universities' pension deficits.</p> <p>\"Oil prices are coming down but they are still at levels higher than most universities will have anticipated, and universities face cost pressures of pay and utilities bills,\" Harding says.</p> <p>And universities are \"still reeling\" at the bad timing of the inflation figure set last week, which will mean a 5% pay rise for university staff this year.</p> <p>\"RPI [inflation] has peaked at the wrong time for universities; it's good for staff but not for universities \u2013 they face tough times and more potential job losses.\"</p>",
  "<p>Insurance group <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/prudential\">Prudential</a></strong> is in demand after reports it is in talks with strategic investors to take a 20% stake in the business. Last week its shares - along with others in the sector - came under pressure on fears it may need money to bolster its capital base. Investors were concerned that insurers may follow the banks in calling on shareholders for cash.</p> <p>Now it seems the Pru does want extra funds, not to bolster its balance sheet but to help make a \u00a38.6bn bid for the Asian operations of AIG, the group bailed out by the US government recently.</p> <p>That news has gone down well, and the Pru is now 35p higher at 305p.</p> <p>In a buy note, Panmure Gordon said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Whilst concerns over the likely market impact on solvency capital is understandable given the uncertainties, a 28% fall in Pru's share price last week seems overdone. We think Pru will reassure to the extent that it can, with third quarter new business figures released tomorrow. Reports of a 20% investment by Middle Eastern and Chinese investors to enable an audacious bid for AIG's Asian operation would be a huge coup if it were to come off. We have lowered our target price from 707p to 585p reflecting recessionary impact, but maintain our buy recommendation.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Other insurers, however, are not having as much luck, as the capital concerns continue to weigh. <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/standardlife\">Standard Life</a></strong> has lost 16.25p to 208.75p, while <strong>RSA Insurance Group </strong>is down 3% at 116.3p and <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/avivabusiness\">Aviva</a></strong> is 7.75p lower at 300.5p.</p> <p>Overall, the market is in positive territory, with the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> 56.58 points higher at 4119.59. Suggestions the government might accelerate spending plans also helped sentiment, while a rebound in metals prices despite signs of a continuing slowdown in China lifted the miners. <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/riotinto\">Rio Tinto</a></strong> rose 128p to \u00a323.79 while <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/vedantaresources\">Vedanta Resources</a></strong> was 27.5p better at 651.5p.</p> <p>News that Dutch group ING had received \u20ac10bn from its government yesterday helped push UK banks higher. </p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/lloydstsbgroup\">Lloyds TSB</a></strong> is up 8.4p at 167.2p, with Credit Suisse lifting its price target from 170p to 175p. But its analysts are still nervous about the sector as a whole.</p> <p>They said this morning:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"For the first time since last August, we think UK bank share prices are factoring in a relatively severe downturn. For us, the issue has never been whether impairment charges would dent tangible NAV to the level of prevailing share prices, but whether banks would have to raise further substantial amounts of capital. The latest round of capital issuance should put a line under that.</p> <p>Combined with the liquidity guarantee, we think the sector will finally start to find its level. </p> <p>However, we still wouldn't be buying. In fact, we remain nervous that the indiscriminate reduction in credit availability could lead to a sharper downturn that that modelled. And besides, newsflow over the coming months is likely to be very poor.</p> <p>Overall the Government plan is a good one and should provide some degree of stability to the banking sector. But it will take time to de-lever the system, and the downturn is likely to be quite severe, in our view. Banks do not offer enough upside to compensate for the risks, and so we remain cautious.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Bookmaker <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/williamhill\">William Hill</a></strong> has climbed nearly 20% to 199.25p after an upbeat trading statement, helping rival <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/ladbrokes\">Ladbrokes</a></strong> rise 11p to 155.5p.</p> <p>But telecoms group <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/cablewireless\">Cable &amp; Wireless</a></strong> has slipped 4.6p to 137.5p after weekend reports it may delay demerger plans given the current state of the financial markets. The company tried to reassure investors that it was still looking at all options to realise value for shareholders.</p> <p>Sports retailer<strong> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/jjbsports\">JJB</a></strong> has jumped 11% to 36.5p after it sold a stake of around 5% at 28.5p a share to Mike Ashley's <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/sportsdirectinternational\">Sports Direct International</a></strong>, up 1.25p to 39.5p. Sports Direct also holds contracts for difference taking its total holding to around 22%.</p> <p>In a buy note on JJB, Panmure Gordon said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The cash injection from Sports Direct is helpful and should assist the market in being persuaded that the shares have been oversold. JJB is now on a firmer financial footing and its stores are looking as good as they can do, considering that the retail environment is the worst for 30 years.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>On Sports Direct, Panmure added:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"While the investment in JJB is curious, we believe that it does provide a strong signal that [Sports Direct] has access to cash, which means that the shares are over-sold. We therefore increase our target price from 30p to 48p, despite reducing forecasts.\" </p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>China has fuelled fears over a global recession by warning that the financial crisis is damaging its economic growth, as South Korea became the latest government to launch a banking rescue.</p> <p>Data released today showed that China's gross domestic product expanded by 9% in the third quarter of 2008, down from 10.1% for the second quarter. Although this is still extremely healthy compared with other major economies, it is below analyst expectations - and the first time GDP growth has dipped below 10% in almost three years.</p> <p>China's government blamed the lower growth on the world economic slowdown, which means <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/2008/oct/16/china-banks-financial-crisis\">less demand for Chinese exports</a>. </p> <p>\"The growth rate of the world economy has slowed down noticeably. There are more uncertain and volatile factors in the international economic climate,\" said spokesman Li Xiaochao of the National Bureau of Statistics.</p> <p>\"All these factors have started to release their negative impact on China's economy.\"</p> <p>After years of boom, there are signs that the Chinese economy may now be suffering from the fallout from the credit crunch. GDP growth has now slowed for the last five consecutive five quarters. The country is a huge consumer of raw materials, and last week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/16/riotinto-mining\">Rio Tinto spooked the mining sector</a> by warning that demand from China was slowing down.<br> Analysts believe that GDP growth will slow further in the fourth quarter, as the impact of the financial crisis bites.</p> <p>\"A gloomy outlook lies ahead after the third quarter, and concerns about the slowdown now outweigh concerns about inflation,\" said Chen Jinren, an analyst at Huatai Securities.</p> <p>China's toymaking industry is under particular pressure, following a series of safety scares last year. Last week more than 6,000 employees lost their jobs when Smart Union, a major toy manufacturer in Dongguan, closed. It blamed a fall in demand from the US. </p> <p><strong>$100bn Korea move welcomed</strong></p> <p>Stockmarkets across Asia recorded gains overnight - after a week of volatility - as traders welcomed a $130bn bail-out (\u00a374.32bn) of South Korea's banking sector.</p> <p>Yesterday, the South Korea government announced it would take fresh action to support its banks; $30bn of fresh liquidity is on offer, plus loan guarantees totalling $100bn.</p> <p>The move came just days after ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's put the country's five biggest banks on a ratings watch. S&amp;P warned that they could struggle to repay foreign loans, as the South Korean won has fallen by a third against other currencies since January.</p> <p>Finance minister Kang Man-soo told reporters in Seoul that the measures would \"allay fears in the financial market,\" and \"avoid placing domestic banks at a competitive disadvantage in terms of overseas funding\".</p> <p>The news sent the country's stockmarket, the Kospi, up by over 2% in late trading. Japan's Nikkei index closed 3.6% higher, recovering some of its recent losses.</p> <p>But in a further sign that the crisis is far from over, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/19/ing-bank-dutch-cash-injection\">ING has received a \u20ac10bn (\u00a37.7bn) injection from the Dutch government</a> to shore up its capital ratios. The bank denied it was in financial trouble, insisting that the recapitalising of UK and US banks meant it had to follow suit.</p>",
  "<p>Andrew Graham <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/15/economics-china\">suggested</a> in yesterday's Guardian that global recession could be averted if <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a> spends its trillions of foreign exchange reserves. I partly agree with him: China should be invited into the G8 to help restore the stability of the global financial markets. However, it is probably unrealistic to expect that a wave of Chinese acquisitions will bail out struggling banks. </p> <p>China currently has $1.9tn in foreign exchange reserves. Around half that money is invested in dollar-dominated assets, with the rest in euros and gold. As the dollar depreciates, China is already suffering considerable losses. In early October, some foreign media reported that China would increase its $200bn debt holdings. This was quickly denied by China's central bank, and Chinese blogs and online message boards are full of people questioning the wisdom of acquiring US debts in current market conditions. They argue that the financial crisis is caused by greedy American investment bankers and China should not help to bail them out. In recent days, senior politicians in China have indicated that officials will be concentrating on domestic issues rather than extending help to the outside world. </p> <p>Some Americans, on the other hand, believe China has contributed to the crisis. They argue that by putting its huge foreign reserves into American financial markets, China helped create too much liquidity and create the financial bubble. However, in China, most experts blame the loose monetary policies America has adopted in the past decade for the build-up of liquidity, and believe light regulation of investment banks made the leverage rate reach a crazy level. With the root cause of the crash unclear, the Chinese government is moving cautiously. </p> <p>Meanwhile, China has many urgent issues to tackle at home. After a bullish run over the past two years, the property bubble has burst, causing the downturn of the stock market. The economy faces <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/16/riotinto-mining\">tough challenges</a> as exports decline. Some sectors, like IT, real estate and securities, have been hit hard by the crisis and have begun to cut jobs. The Chinese government has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/09/china.marketturmoil\">cut interest rates </a> twice in a month and subsidised certain export-oriented industries, indicating that it is seriously worried about economic growth. </p> <p>In this context, the Chinese hope the government will spend any spare cash on reviving their own economy and capital markets, rather than helping America. Furthermore, failures in previous investments, including China Investment Corp's investment in Blackstone, China Development Bank's stake in Barclays and Ping An Insurance's <a href=\"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2008-10/07/content_7083076.htm\">holdings in Fortis</a>, cast doubt on Chinese companies' overseas acquisition strategy. Under pressure from shareholders, Ping An has announced it is to stop further investment in Fortis. Many Chinese banks have also revealed their holdings in subprime debts \u2013 investments that have suffered huge losses. Chinese media are questioning the investment strategies of state-owned financial institutions. </p> <p>So it would be almost impossible to persuade Chinese institutions to buy into American financial assets right now, no matter how attractive the prices appear. The bosses of state-owned financial institutions are more concerned about being seen to do the right thing without making mistakes.</p>",
