  "<p>We all know about statistics and how much store to set by them, but here's an interesting fact: during the first weekend of the new experimental laws - the ones designed to open up the game - no side in the Premiership got a try bonus point. Ditto the Magners League, although James Hook steered the Ospreys to a four-try win against a depleted Cardiff Blues on Tuesday.</p> <p>So stats can prove anything. But it's often worthwhile looking at the figures when you suspect a pattern forming. For instance, the opening weekend in the Premiership produced an average of 37.82 points per game as opposed to 51.8 last season, and the number of tries scored averaged 3.3 compared to six. Now look at the southern hemisphere. The backroom boys say that under the new laws in the Tri-Nations the fly-halves kick 50% of possession whereas in the Six Nations under the old laws it was 30%, which tends to confirm the feeling that I had after viewing tapes of last weekend's games in England - there is more kicking and even more than I expected.</p> <p>Why? It will take possibly four or five games before more realistic judgments are made, but could it be that the lineout has become a mess - a dog fight - and even the best operators are now less sure of winning their own ball? Some will say that was the legislators' intention, but by removing the restriction on numbers - either side can decide how many they want in the line - it has been reduced as an attacking platform. In effect, the legislators have (theoretically) created more attacking opportunities off the scrum, by moving the offside line back five metres, but have taken more away simply because there are still more lineouts than scrums.</p> <p>In the manner of men fascinated by such things, Will Greenwood and I were last week drooling over memories of quick ball from a five-man lineout. That isn't going to happen any more because no side is going to hand their opponents an obvious advantage. Likewise the old line, when the defending side had to guess where the ball was going and position their lifters. Two pods - two lifters and a jumper in each - used to leave two men spare.</p> <p>A throw to the front jumper was handy setting up a drive, ball to the back tied in the breakaway forwards, and quick ball off the middle set up the backs. Now nine men move into the line to form three pods, every option - more or less - is covered and everyone is left guessing.</p> <p>These are just a few thoughts - possibly premature ones and I'd like to hear yours - on a first weekend which also produced a much more warming stat, average attendances across the Premiership were up from 12,345 to 15,756, and confirmation that guile and experience still have a place in an era when players keep getting bigger and faster. </p> <p>In May 1996 I played against Mike Catt in the cross-code matches that celebrated the end of a century of niggle between league and union. At Maine Road, Manchester, under league rules, Wigan beat Bath convincingly (Bath won the return under union rules at Twickenham) and Catt stood out as the player who could have been a success had he decided to switch codes. He picked things up quickly and found ways to create space for himself and others. Last Saturday, 12 years on and 11 days short of his 37th birthday, he was at it again, this time for London Irish against us in the opening fixture of the season at Twickenham. At the time it was a painful experience because, as champions, we let ourselves down.</p> <p>In fact the pain has been there all week, but reviewing the tapes to see where faults lay has given better perspective of just how influential Catt still is coaching the London Irish attack in training and on the field. His legs lasted only 65 minutes but for all that time he pulled the strings, translating his accumulated nous into a new era and passing it on to those around him.</p> <p>As I say, it was painful at the time but hard to begrudge the smile on Catt's face as he made way for Eoghan Hickey, 10 years his junior. It's nice to see that the artists of the game can still flourish.</p>",
  "<p>The neat rows of new homes in the gated community sit behind freshly painted three-metre-high cement walls and rows of manicured shrubs. </p> <p>Pavements lined with imported eucalyptus trees border smoothly paved streets that fill at twilight with cyclists and walkers. Further back, another cluster of houses is being built, including an eight-bedroom villa with a pool, wraparound deck and balcony supported by doric columns. </p> <p>Residents at the Aino Mina housing development also have access to a mosque, two private schools, football fields, playgrounds and private armed guards on duty 24 hours a day. A hospital, supermarket, pizza parlour and golf course are also planned. </p> <p>But, despite luxuries rivalling those found in exclusive suburban communities in the United States, many owners are trying to sell or rent out their homes. Others have temporarily abandoned properties. The reason is as simple as the long-standing estate agent's maxim: location, location, location. </p> <p>This upmarket residential neighbourhood is situated on the outskirts of the provincial capital of Kandahar - one of the most volatile and lawless provinces of Afghanistan. Others call the area the heartbeat of the Taliban, the place where the group formed in the early 1990s and where it is, by all accounts, re-establishing itself today. </p> <p>\"I'm leaving tomorrow,\" Sayed Hakim Kallmi, a 40-year-old hotel manager, said as he stood on the pavement outside his dream home in Aino Mina. He was watching his son and three of his six daughters play with neighbours. \"There's no security here.\" </p> <p>According to Mahmoud Karzai, the driving force behind the project and younger brother of the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, what is taking place is a clash between people who want a better life and those fighting any attempt at progress. </p> <p>\"This is,\" Karzai claimed, \"a war against modernisation.\" </p> <p>Aino Mina began with 24 hectares (60 acres) and an initial investment of $50,000 by five businessmen, including three Afghan-Americans, in 2002 shortly after a US-led invasion of Afghanistan toppled the Taliban. A $3m loan from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, a US government agency that encourages investment from the American private sector in developing foreign economies, boosted the project. </p> <p>Today the project has grown to 800 hectares and $50m of investment. At least 300 homes have been sold. About half of those have been completed and a further 250 are under construction, according to the site manager, Mohammed Gul Pacha Khan. </p> <p>Karzai said he envisioned thousands of residents in a contemporary city on a par with any of its size worldwide. </p> <p>\"Kandahar was once an economic and intellectual centre in Afghanistan, second only to Kabul, until the Taliban took it over,\" said Karzai. \"This was a dream come true for me because I was eager to build a modern city for the people with a proper water and electrical system, roads, sidewalks, trees, hospitals and schools.\" </p> <p>A Taliban representative said his group opposed development because Karzai and the other investors were using government influence to enrich themselves. </p> <p>\"This is the land of the people,\" Qari Yousef Ahmadi said in a telephone interview. \"The brother of Karzai is using it to serve his own interests and the interests of his friends.\" </p> <p>Not so, the younger Karzai said. In fact, he countered, his group was providing affordable housing with modern amenities and building a tax base for the government, while creating approximately 1,000 jobs at a time when a weak economy and high unemployment were hindering development. </p> <p>\"When the Taliban were in power,\" he said, \"there was nothing but dust and an undeveloped city with no signs of civilisation.\" </p> <p>Taliban operatives have made no secret of their campaign to intimidate residents of Aino Mina. Ahmadi, who described himself as a spokesman for the group, said: \"We seriously warn people not to buy here. Those who stay there and who buy there will be held responsible for the actions we take against them later.\" </p> <p>Residents and workers in the development say the Taliban have targeted the area and maintain an unmistakable presence. During a sweltering July afternoon, a thickly bearded man in a shalwar kameez with a turban wrapped around his head rode a motorcycle along the nearly empty streets of Aino Mina with an AK-47 strapped across his back. The motorbike and the AK-47 both are long-favoured hallmarks of the Taliban. </p> <p>Despite the rider, a handful of construction workers at the project hauled wheelbarrows full of dirt, lugged slabs of concrete and scaled bamboo ladders. Naik Mohammed, 28, pointed to a two-story townhouse and said Taliban militants had recently looted the elegant dwelling and demanded protection money from its occupants. </p> <p>\"They told the owners to pay $200,000 and they would allow them to live there peacefully and they won't kill them,\" Mohammed said. \"The family left the next day.\" </p> <p>However, Mohammed, who earns about $4 a day for a 12-hour shift, added that neither he nor any of his co-workers had been threatened. </p> <p>But Mohammed Sadiq, 38, who bought an eight-bedroom house in the project, said the kidnapping of two Aino Mina residents last month had hurt sales. \"Building has slowed,\" said Sadiq, who also is a construction manager for the development. \"People are afraid to buy because of the Taliban.\" </p> <p>Not all residents are as concerned. Some even say they feel safer on the development than in the city, where roadside bombs targeting Nato and government security forces explode with sickening regularity, crime is rife and religious extremism is prevalent. </p> <p>Mohabatullan Sayed Gul, 42, an electronic parts shop owner who has lived for five months in a three-bedroom ranch-style house complete with a flourishing garden of tomatoes, aubergines and cauliflowers fortified by a towering cement wall, said he moved there primarily for the private girls' school available to his three daughters. </p> <p>\"This is a modern place where modern people live and girls are free to go to school,\" said Sayed Gul. He had received threatening letters at the doorstep of his previous residence in Kandahar from Taliban militants warning him to refrain from sending his daughters to school. \"There are many people in the city who don't want girls to receive an education.\" </p> <p>Others are packing up. </p> <p>Kallmi, the hotel manager, spent the day preparing his wife and seven children to leave the house they were renting for $150 a month. The previous owner also had left because he did not feel safe. As Kallmi moved furniture and stacked bundles filled with personal belongings, he said he would leave the next day and go north. </p> <p>\"I was very happy in this environment,\" Kallmi said. \"I'm sorry I have to leave.\"</p> <h2>Soldier deaths</h2> <p>Two US soldiers died in insurgent attacks in Afghanistan yesterday, making 2008 the deadliest year for American forces in the country since the 2001 invasion. The Nato force said that one soldier was killed when insurgents attacked a compound. The separate US-led coalition said that a second died while conducting combat operations. No other details were released, but a western military official said that both the dead soldiers were American. Yesterday's deaths brings to 113 the number of troops who have died in Afghanistan this year, compared with 111 in 2007. Taliban attacks this year have become more brazen, sophisticated and powerful. Some 33,000 American troops are stationed in Afghanistan, the highest level since 2001. <br><strong>Associated Press in Kabul</strong></p>",
  "<p>Each had a job to do, and each did it to perfection. The four key witnesses chosen by Greenpeace to speak in its defence at the Kingsnorth trial were crucial to the environmental group's acquittal. They were chosen not only to \"push all the right buttons\" with the court, but to answer the very specific questions the judge would ask the jury to answer, says Ben Stewart, Greenpeace's communications director and a defendant in the case. \"We wanted a not guilty verdict, but we also wanted to put the government's policy on coal in the dock.\"</p> <p>To convince the jury (and stay out of jail), says Stewart, the activists needed to show Kingsnorth posed \"a real and immediate danger to property around the world, and that our actions were proportionate and reasonable to prevent that\". The witnesses' task was to hammer home the truth of that claim. </p> <p><strong>James (aka Jim) Hansen</strong> was the authoritative voice required to put Greenpeace's protest into its global scientific context. Possibly the world's leading climate scientist, Hansen is director of Nasa's Goddard Institute for Space Studies and Al Gore's science adviser on global warming. He is something of a green superhero, in effect introducing the world to the concept of climate change.</p> <p>Among the key points Hansen made to the court were that the proportion of CO2 in the atmosphere has already passed a safe maximum and will have to be rolled back; that this cannot be achieved unless all coal-fired power stations without carbon capture are decommissioned pronto; and that if we carry on as we are sea levels will rise at least 2m this century and 1m species will be pushed into extinction (including 400 by Kingsnorth alone).</p> <p>\"The simple but shocking truth is we have gone too far,\" he said. \"We place our planetary system, inhabitants and future generations in grave peril ... It's up to those of us alive today to take the bold steps needed. There's just barely still time.\" </p> <p><strong>Dr Geoff Meaden</strong>'s job was to put the wind up the court from a regional perspective. Something of a local boy (he's principal lecturer in the Department of Geographical and Life Sciences at Canterbury University), he gave evidence via videolink from Brazil. Nor can his warning that there could be no summer ice left in the Arctic within five years, that Kingsnorth power station itself would be \"extremely vulnerable\" to flooding through climate change, and that things were \"so urgent that unless we act immediately to rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, by the next century we may have to abandon up to 20% of Kent to the sea.\" </p> <p>While all the scientific evidence pointed to the fact that we were approaching a tipping point in climate change, the most urgent tipping point was \"a change in human behaviours and actions\", Meaden said. \"It is overwhelmingly perceived,\" he added, \"by the defendants, the scientific community and myself\" that climate change is caused by humans.</p> <p><strong>Aqqaluk Lynge</strong>, a former minister in Greenland's home rule government and a vice-president of the Inuit Circumpolar Conference, a human rights organisation representing some 160,000 Inuit living in the Arctic regions, furnished a vivid first-hand account of what global warming will do, and is actually doing. </p> <p>He's a star witness for the environmental movement on the effects of global warming and it's not hard to see why: against the scientists' charts and figures, Lynge's evidence is undeniably graphic. Plus he usually wears a sealskin waistcoat, which looks pretty cool when everyone else is in a grey suit. </p> <p>\"Climate change affects my community, the Inuit people, by affecting their environment,\" Lynge told this week's trial in a videolink from Greenland. \"We see it in the kind and numbers of species that they hunt, the house and camp constructions that they have to build on melting and unpredictable soils, the unpredictable weather ... the sliding of houses into the sea ... the reduction of habitats for polar bears and other species, and the introduction of new pest species.\"</p> <p>Lynge first appeared in the UK in July last year, when he wowed a public inquiry into the proposed expansion of Stansted airport. The Inuit are \"the canary in the global coal mine\", he said. Some villages have already lost homes, and thinning ice makes hunting harder. \"We don't hunt for sport,\" he said. \"You go to the supermarket. We go hunting on sea ice.\"</p> <p><strong>Zac Goldsmith</strong> is a former editor of the Ecologist magazine and the Conservative party's current parliamentary candidate for the constituency of Richmond Park in west London. His task was to place the activists' actions in a clear political context, which he did by declaring from the outset that there was a \"staggering mismatch between what we've heard from government and what we've seen from government in terms of policy\". Despite all the Labour government's rhetoric, he stressed, emissions have risen since 1997 and continue to rise. Coal is the \"defining challenge\": 10 of Europe's 30 most polluting coal-fired power plants are in Britain, and building new ones will \"make it very much harder\" to convince the likes of China and India to cut back on fossil fuel use. Goldsmith accused the government of a \"profound lack of imagination\" when it came to examining alternative energy solutions.</p>",
  "<p>Colin Stanbridge of the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Letters, September 10) takes a very narrow and ill-informed view of the immigration issue - and one which does not reflect the view of business. He writes that \"immigration adds billions to our economy every year\". Yet the Lords economic affairs committee put the gains at 62p a week for each of us. Furthermore, an Institute of Directors poll found that 85% agreed that migration policy should also take into account the impact of immigration on housing and public services - something Mr Stanbridge seems to ignore.</p> <p>The government's own forecast shows that immigration will add 7 million to our population in the next 25 years. This is equivalent to seven times the population of Birmingham. The cross-party group is not, as Mr Stanbridge writes, seeking to constrain industry's search for global talent. We simply propose that we should break the link between economic migration and permanent settlement so as to stabilise our population and ease the pressures on our public services and, indeed, on our society.<br><strong>Frank Field MP</strong><br>Lab, Birkenhead </p> <p>Frank Field and his fellow members of the cross-party immigration group are wrong - the cap won't fit and the prime minister must make this clear (Balance the ins and outs, September 8). The real concern the public have about immigration is illegal immigration, not legal immigration for people with skills. People do use the four-year work visa as a stepping stone to settle in the UK. To tackle this we need more clarity in our visa system. It needs to be made clear from the start that visas of this kind are for a limited period and will not lead to settlement. We need to be tougher at enforcing the laws we already have.<br><strong>Keith Vaz MP</strong><br>Chairman, home affairs committee</p>",
  "<p>Ten years ago, the idea that the head of Greenpeace could sit down at a banquet for the rainforest with the Prince of Wales and David Attenborough, along with ministers and some of the world's richest people, would have been inconceivable. But John Sauven, the head of the environment group that came close to being proscribed as a terrorist organisation in the US only a few years ago, was at Mansion House in the City of London on Wednesday night, sipping port and chatting about carbon credits and the intricacies of climate change policy with the men who control trillions of dollars. </p> <p>It is a measure of how far the environment has reached the inner halls of the establishment that Sauven should have been invited at all and was not to be found at a far more raucous celebration party being held a few miles away. Four hours earlier, after an eight-day trial in Maidstone, Kent, a jury of nine men and three women had found two Greenpeace staffers and four volunteers not guilty of criminally damaging the Kingsnorth coal-fired power station, the 200m tall smokestack of which they had scaled in a climate change protest last October. </p> <p>There was a heady atmosphere of money and power at the banquet, but a far greater drama had been played out in the crown court. The world's leading climate scientist had come from the US to give evidence and if the group had lost, two of them would almost certainly have gone to prison and become the UK's first climate change martyrs. A guilty verdict could have also seriously dented the growing climate change protest movement and it is quite likely that the government would have given permission at the earliest opportunity for a new power station to be built at Kingsnorth. </p> <p>In fact, the verdict was a real shock for government, the coal industry and Kingsnorth's German owners. John Hutton, the energy secretary, has, with the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (DBERR), been strongly backing a major expansion of the UK coal industry against fierce opposition from the former environment secretary David Miliband, and the current one, Hilary Benn. Until now, the pendulum has leaned slightly towards Hutton, who has argued that more UK coal is vital if we are to keep the lights on, and that climate change can be dealt with later by others. But the cabinet is split, and Gordon Brown has put off making any firm decision on expansion. </p> <p>The Maidstone verdict has changed all that and could prove a turning point both for the protest movement and industrial policy. It gave the clear political message that 12 people with - one must assume - no great scientific knowledge, had listened to the evidence of one of the best scientists in the world and concluded that climate change is now so serious and so urgent an issue that it is legally justifiable for people to invade a power station and do \u00a330,000 worth of damage. </p> <p>Out of the blue, the environmentalists say, the legitimacy of the government to pursue an expanding coal policy has been undermined and it may have become impossible for E.ON, the German owners of Kingsnorth, to go ahead with a new plant without fitting a \u00a3500m carbon capture and storage plant to collect and dispose of the greenhouse gases. </p> <p>What is particularly galling for the backers of coal-fired power stations is that, because of the amount of damage alleged to have been done at Kingsnorth, the case went to a jury rather than a magistrate. The crown prosecution service and many corporations know that campaigners who challenge the law by non-violent action are being regularly acquitted by juries. In the past decade, prosecutions of protesters against GM crops, incinerators, new roads and nuclear, chemical and arms trade companies have all collapsed after defendants argued that they had acted according to their consciences and that they were trying to prevent a greater crime. Greenpeace itself has a four-nil record against the crown using the same defence and was widely known to be seeking a jury trial to present complex arguments about coal and climate change.</p> <p>\"They were pretty confident that a jury would listen to them more than the government,\" said one lawyer yesterday. \"It gives them a platform. I doubt that we will see another climate change jury trial for many years.\"</p> <p>\"We are seeing a pattern emerging. The public is increasingly speaking through the courts,\" says Martyn Day, a partner with Leigh Day solicitors, which specialises in environmental cases. \"These cases are a good guide to public mood and politicians should take close heed of them. It shows that society is greatly concerned about what is happening with the environment and that it is suspicious of government and business when they say they are acting responsibly. </p> <p>\"We're looking at a society which is far more in tune with the environment than in the past. Politicians and companies have not understood that most people now understand the issues. There's a feeling that government and the authorities have not been paying sufficient heed, and that the courts are righting the balance,\" he said.</p> <p>Climate change activists hope now that the floodgates have been opened and that it will be open season on coal and other dirty energy industries. Hundreds of people have already pledged to take direct action against any expansion of the industry and the Maidstone case is expected to inspire copycat actions around the country. History would suggest that the carbon protest movement will gain in confidence like the anti-roads and GM movements, and that coal will be targeted mercilessly. </p> <p>Some groups could not even wait for yesterday's verdict. Even as the jury was deliberating on Wednesday afternoon in Maidstone, Welsh climate change activists along with angry villagers invaded the Hilton hotel in Cardiff where directors of an open-cast mine were meeting. </p> <p>It's odds on the Welsh activists will not be given a jury trial, and they certainly won't be invited to the next banquet in Mansion House.</p>",
  "<p><strong>July 18</strong></p> <p>This morning, my album was nominated for the Mercury music prize. I actually found out two days ago, but they announced the shortlist today. I played a song at the big launch thing in Covent Garden, to a room full of industry people. That was just plain scary. After I'd finished I went straight upstairs for a cigarette and tried to avoid everyone. But then they told me I had to have my photo taken in front of the Mercury logo. I've never done anything as horrific as that. I was taken into this room, not really paying attention, and suddenly 30 people with the biggest cameras I've ever seen were screaming at me to look at them. I stayed there for about 30 seconds and thought, \"This isn't for me.\" Although I suppose, in a way, it would've been worse if I'd enjoyed it.</p> <p>I don't imagine that being nominated will alter anything dramatically. Actually, that's kind of wishful thinking, because everything's very nice and relaxed for me at the moment, so I wouldn't really want things to get manic. But I'm pretty sure they won't, because I am still a folk artist.</p> <p>It's been a surreal day, but a very exciting one, too. I've got some friends coming round for dinner tonight, so I'm going to bake a celebratory cake.</p> <p><strong>July 25</strong></p> <p>My life hasn't exactly changed since the nomination, but I have had a lot of lovely congratulatory texts from friends. Oh, and I went home to Reading a few days ago, and there was an article in the local paper about me being nominated. They even interviewed my teacher. I owe a lot to her, so that was nice, but it was all quite strange, too. I don't really enjoy reading about myself, because I don't want to look at myself in the third person, in case it changes my opinion of myself.</p> <p>The new Noah and the Whale single, which I sang backing vocals on, has gone into the Top 20 this week, which is quite exciting. It's great that they've got this brilliant pop single that will open them up to a lot of people. I suppose it's the same with the Mercury; it pushes my music to people who wouldn't otherwise hear it, without me really having to do anything.</p> <p>The winner is announced in six weeks. I don't want to want to win it, if that makes sense. I think it's perhaps better just to be nominated. Having said that, my sister has put a bet on me to win, so there is some pressure.</p> <p><strong>August 7</strong></p> <p>I'm in Melbourne, on a rather fleeting trip to Australia. It's been very, very nice indeed. We've done three gigs, one at the Splendour in the Grass festival in Byron Bay and two little headline shows in Sydney and Melbourne, which were both sold out. Everyone we've dealt with here has been incredibly friendly, and I seem to have turned into the most positive person ever, possibly because of the maddening over-tiredness. I've been really chatty at shows, too, which is really weird for me. I'm on the other side of the world and I've changed into a completely different person.</p> <p>I've done a few interviews, but nobody has asked about the Mercury nomination. In fact, the only person who mentioned it was my godmother, whom we were staying with in Sydney. She didn't really know what it was, but she was very excited for me. It was the nicest thing ever staying with her. It'd be lovely to have a mum in every city.</p> <p><strong>August 13</strong></p> <p>We're in Edinburgh at the moment, doing two shows as part of the Fringe. We played in a cave last night with sweat dripping off the walls. None of us could breathe. But it's nice to be here. I love Edinburgh - in fact I'm coming back here next week for a holiday.</p> <p>The Mercury nomination still hasn't had any major impact on me or my career. I've actually been quite surprised by how little it's changed anything. But I have been worrying about what to wear to the ceremony. Apparently it's quite posh, but I'm really not a dress kind of person, so I think I'll stick to jeans and a smart top. I'm definitely not doing the red carpet thing, though. I'm never standing up in front of those horrible photographers ever again in my life. My little old heart can't take much more of that terrifying stuff that I don't enjoy. The fact that I'm going to be playing live there is terrifying enough, thank you.</p> <p><strong>August 19</strong></p> <p>I'm on a train on my way back up to Edinburgh. Since we were there last week, I've played at Lowlands festival near Amsterdam, which was really beautiful and sunny, and Green Man in Wales, which was really wet and cold. Both were fun, though. I really enjoy festivals.</p> <p>My big news is that I've just announced quite a big American tour, with Johnny Flynn, who's amazing. We're calling it the Fee Fie Foe Fum tour, because we wanted some way of letting people know the vibe of the tour without it being like, \"British folk invasion!\" The tagline is, of course, \"I smell the blood of an Englishman\", although I actually have no idea if that's a famous saying in America.</p> <p>I'm going up to Edinburgh for a rest, to get away from London and to see some friends and some plays. I like living in London, but it can get a bit much. Mercury-wise, nothing has really happened this week I'm afraid. To be honest, I don't think anyone's even mentioned it. But it's still lodged there at the back of my mind.</p> <p><strong>August 27</strong></p> <p>It's a good thing I don't have much on this week, because I've come down with a nasty cold. I had a lovely time in Edinburgh, going to see plays, cooking and walking. None of the plays were very good, but I had fun. I took my guitar, too - I take my guitar wherever I go - and did a bit of work on some demos on my laptop.</p> <p>It's two weeks until the Mercury prize and it all seems to be coming together nicely. We've got a special guest fiddle player for our performance, which is very exciting for me. It's Tom from Noah and the Whale, who actually wrote the part for the song we're going to play. I'm looking forward to it, but I know I'm going to be a shivering wreck when it comes to the day. Apparently, I'm still among the bookies' favourites, but it turns out my sister didn't put a bet on me after all, which takes the pressure off slightly. I haven't really thought much about winning. The only thing I've ever won was most improved swimmer when I left primary school, so perhaps I'm not the winning sort.</p> <p><strong>September 3</strong></p> <p>Less than a week to go, and I think I've actually been more on edge than usual. It's starting to feel near and like quite a big deal, which it hasn't before. I really, really don't want to walk down the red carpet, but my manager pointed out that if I didn't, it might look rude. We came to a compromise that the band are going to walk down with me. But I'm definitely not buying any new clothes or having my hair done. Actually, I think I may be under-preparing, but I pride myself on not caring too much about what people think I look like, so I'm trying not to worry about it. </p> <p>I got to talk to Russell Brand on his Radio 2 show at the weekend. It's the only radio show I listen to, so that was terribly exciting. They were saying they wanted me to win, which was nice, although I'm still not sure whether I want that. I happened upon a really good episode of Friends the other day where Joey doesn't win an award and masters that magnanimous look of defeat, which might well come in handy for me.</p> <p><strong>September 10</strong></p> <p>The ceremony was last night. To my surprise, I enjoyed it, although the red carpet was just as horrific as I predicted. I went down with the band, and we got shouted at from various quarters. I gave a kind of painful stare/grin and then just ran away. But I have to admit that I lost all integrity last week and decided I had to look smart, so I ended up wearing a black dress which a friend made for me. I was completely numb for my performance, which I think was quite beneficial. Then I went and had dinner at the table with my sisters. The food was pretty gross, but I am quite fussy.</p> <p>Just before Jools Holland announced the winner, I suddenly felt, like, \"Shit, what if I did win? I have no idea what I'd do.\" All the blood rushed to my legs and I was terrified he'd read my name out and my legs would give way. Then Elbow won and their speech was so perfect, and I genuinely breathed a massive sigh of relief.</p> <p>Although I never came round to wanting to win, I do think the Mercury is a worthwhile thing. I heard some people saying it's a big commercial mess, but it really does put effort into finding music that people might not have heard otherwise. That has to be good.</p> <p>I am bloody glad it's over.</p>",
  "<p>The music documentary Heavy Metal in Baghdad may be a fascinating insight into modern Iraq, but it's also got something else going for it: it's the latest example of what happens when magazines start making movies. The feature is the work of Vice Films, the film wing of Vice magazine, the publication that chronicled and created an international legion of skinny-jeaned, asymmetrically haired hipsters. In the process they also developed a reporting style preoccupied with \"the universality of youth subculture\", as co-founder Shane Smith calls it, delivered in fluent dude-speak and filtered through several levels of irony. </p> <p>So when they found Acrassicauda, Iraq's only heavy metal band, Vice thought they'd hit paydirt. \"It was perfect,\" agrees Suroosh Alvi, another of the magazine's co-founders and co-director of the film. \"The idea that a heavy metal band existed in Baghdad and was playing during Saddam's day. It fit our brand and all dimensions of it.\" </p> <p>Several other film projects are already in development. Vice's second feature, based on the true story of Appalachian folk hero Jesco White (\"this hillbilly, multiple-personality Charles Manson that you love\") is out next year. They've also sold a script about the black market in nuclear warheads to New Line and put together a screenplay about an American al-Qaida operative, on which Casey Affleck worked. The thing that links their projects is that most started life as articles in the magazine. \"We're a content company,\" says Smith. \"If it's a good story in the magazine, why isn't it a good book or movie or record?\"</p> <p>It won't be the first time film producers have mined magazines for inspiration. Famously, two articles by Susan Orlean have ended up as movies (Adaptation and Blue Crush). Barely an issue of Vanity Fair goes by without an article being optioned for production by a studio. Miramax mogul Harvey Weinstein even created Talk magazine as a means of harvesting script ideas. And, given that Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard both wrote for French film journal Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma, it won't be the first time a magazine has put its artistic values on screen, either. </p> <p>But style mag editors turned movie makers have their own problems, as Dazed and Confused co-founder Rankin discovered. In 2006, he dared to dabble in pictures, releasing The Lives of The Saints, a sub-Lock Stock drama with spiritual leanings. The same aesthetic that beguiled Dazed's twentysomething readers irritated film critics, and indignant reviews put him firmly back in his place. Similarly, Vice's own modus operandi, a little trick Smith likes to call \"entertainmentising the issues\", may be greeted suspiciously by viewers who don't feel they need someone to be wearing a Metallica T-shirt in order to empathise with them. </p> <p>On the other hand, Vice benefits from the kind of well-developed business model that even old fogies can appreciate: 14 international editions, a record label, a clothing brand, and an online broadcast network. \"We're not just a director schlepping a film with nothing behind him,\" says Eddy Moretti, Heavy Metal's co-director and the head of Vice Films. \"We have a built-in audience and we bring platforms.\" </p> <p>Better still, their debut release has helped bridge the gap between the heartless ironists Vice once were and the caring, sharing global corporation they're hoping to become. As Alvi says, \"People who call us 'The Hipster Bible' watch the film and say, 'Wow! These guys used to only care about Ritalin and cocaine, now they're making one of the best music documentaries ever.' It's been the opposite of negative. It's been great for the brand.\"</p>",
  "<p>We are entering - for those keeping track - the new new, new new world order. President George Bush Snr's world order of multilateral cooperation was embarrassed by Somalia, Rwanda and Bosnia. Pax Americana, rebranded as globalisation under Bill Clinton, was shattered by 9/11. For the past seven years we've been living under the \"war on terror\" world order paradigm, creating more cleavages than it has healed. </p> <p>But this time the conditions are very different. The world has stopped waiting for the US - and its next president - to declare its roadmap for the future. Instead, the other 96% of the planet has decided to move on with its business. And business is booming. The major emerging powers, production centres and financial capitals - Russia, China, India, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Kazakhstan, the United Arab Emirates and others - are creating connections among themselves. While some Americans gloat that the global economic slowdown is evidence the world has not \"decoupled\" from it yet, the situation would have been much worse if emerging markets were not robust centres of growth. </p> <p>This new economics is the foundation for a new geopolitics to which the US is more responding than shaping. To claim the world will warm to the return of the kinder, pre-Bush America requires a heroic leap of faith. Will Russia stop using Gazprom diplomacy and military muscle to bully Ukraine and occupy its near abroad? Will Iran stop seeking nuclear weapons? Will China stop providing military, financial, diplomatic and other lifelines to every country the US deems a \"rogue state\"? Only if America can change any of these should the next US president have any right to declare the next \"new world order\".</p> <p>To speak of world order is to speak of a stable distribution of power in the world. But no such predictable pattern exists. Power has diffused not only to heavyweights such as China, but the EU - the most formidable economic force in the world. Militarily, rapid build-ups are occurring in the Middle East and east Asia - and now also Latin America, with Venezuela welcoming Russian bombers for training exercises this week. It would be far more appropriate to speak of a \"new middle ages\" than a new order, for we live in a world not just of nations, but of empires, multinational corporations, religious crusaders, non-governmental activists and mega-philanthropists operating on all layers of the complex matrix of 21st-century power. Order will have to be thought of as regional at best - with east Asia falling under the Chinese sphere of influence, and north Africa increasingly under the European - rather than global. </p> <p>The institutional underpinning is not only under strain, but has in effect collapsed. Regional and bilateral preferential trade agreements are proliferating at the expense of the WTO, whose Doha round fell apart weeks ago. The UN security council has not changed since before the end of the cold war. The IMF and World Bank have become marginal players in their own fields as aid falls out of favour in competition with faster and more voluminous foreign direct investment. Where is the architecture for a new world order for a new middle ages?</p> <p>It emerges either after a major war or from the bottom up. The latter is happening already in the far east. The only question is how far it will stretch. Asia has the largest populations and the most money. In the past years an alphabet soup rivalling the EU has emerged, with ASEAN+3 among a host of acronyms that reveal how China is co-opting Japan, Australia and Korea through trade, investment and non-aggression pacts. </p> <p>This is not mere cant - Asian diplomacy has achieved concrete results. The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation's border patrols manage counter-terrorism and trade in central Asia, and might soon be invited to help Nato stabilise Afghanistan. East Asia's major powers conduct defence exercises together, and are planning joint energy exploration agreements. Beyond Asia the Persian Gulf oil producers, and their sovereign wealth funds, are starting to quickly reorientate themselves towards Indian and Chinese demand and markets - far more lucrative than the west. Maybe the west can one day be independent of Middle East oil, but that only increases eastern leverage over the energy-rich lands in between. In Africa, many nations have profited from Chinese investment. Some decry China as the \"new colonialists\", but in the age of transparency it is likely to learn the power of shame far more quickly than the west did. </p> <p>So perhaps there will be a new world order - but one dictated not from Washington but Beijing. The cold war was never truly an east-west rivalry - only now is the real east rising. Whichever world order project we embark on in the coming years, it will have to balance east and west, north and south, public and private, international and global. Whatever we call this order, it involves all of us much more than any of the past. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Parag Khanna is a senior research fellow at the New America Foundation and author of The Second World </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.paragkhanna.com\">paragkhanna.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama yesterday made a belated personal appeal to Bill Clinton for advice on how to fight back against a resurgent Republican presidential campaign. The lunchtime meeting in New York between the Democratic party's two towering figures came amid growing despair at Obama's slide in the polls in the past week. Democratic figures are openly expressing fears that he does not have a strategy to counter the rising appeal of John McCain and his running mate, Sarah Palin. </p> <p>Although Clinton extravagantly praised Obama in his speech to the Democratic convention in Denver last month, the relationship between the two has remained strained after Obama's bitter Democratic primary campaign against Hillary Clinton earlier this year. Yesterday's meeting, which took place at the headquarters of Clinton's foundation in Harlem, was their first face-to-face encounter since the primary season ended in June. They had spoken on the phone on only two occasions since Obama won the nomination.</p> <p>In an attempt to smooth the way for the meeting, Obama said he saw parallels between his own campaign and Clinton's in 1992: a relatively unknown politician fighting the Republicans against a backdrop of an ailing economy.</p> <p>\"I've got lunch with Bill Clinton, which I'm looking forward to,\" he told David Letterman on Wednesday night. \"There's nobody smarter in politics and he is going to be campaigning for us over the next eight weeks, which I'm thrilled by, because the race that he ran in 92 was similar to what's taking place now.\"</p> <p>Clinton extended the lunch offer to Obama about a week ago - before Palin began to energise the Republican base - after waiting for months for the Democratic candidate to get in touch. If they had met earlier it would have been characterised as Obama meeting Clinton from a position of strength, but it now adds to the sense of Obama being on the defensive and needing help in putting his campaign back on course.</p> <p>Obama said Clinton had been successful in reaching out to people in 1992 on the economy and he would like to use him in that role in this campaign, telling people \"why we need to change the economy in a fundamental way so it works for middle-class families, so that they can get ahead, so that they can send their kids to college. I think he can be a great advocate on behalf of the campaign,\" he said.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton has been actively campaigning for Obama in battleground states. However, she has drawn a line against making personal attacks on Palin, Clinton insiders said. She is happy to attack the Republicans on policy, but thinks it is a strategic mistake to engage in personal criticism of Palin. But she defended Obama who has been under attack for using the phrase \"lipstick on a pig\" to describe McCain's recycled policies. Republicans have accused him of insulting Palin. </p> <p>Clinton dismissed the notion at a press conference yesterday. \"Barack has made this clear,\" she said. \"It was in no way meant as an affront.\" </p> <p>While Bill Clinton will also go out on the trail for Obama, the election timetable is narrowing. The former president has many commitments in the next few weeks, including his annual Global Initiative conference in New York this month, which attracts leaders from the world to discuss climate change and development.</p> <p>A new opinion poll out yesterday showed Obama's poll lead slipping in key states that will determine the election outcome: Florida, Pennsylvania and Ohio. A Quinnipiac University poll showed McCain pulling away in Florida, with a lead of 50% to Obama's 43%. The Republican was narrowing the gap in Pennsylvania, with Obama on 48% and McCain on 45%. Obama maintained his lead in Ohio, 49% to McCain's 44%.</p> <p>There were signs this week of a concerted effort by Obama's campaign to fight back against Republican attacks. A close adviser, Valerie Jarrett, told the Wall Street Journal yesterday that Obama had told her he was not going to let Palin hijack media attention any longer. Echoing the view reached by Hillary Clinton and other senior Democrats, Obama said he would desist from personal attacks on Palin and \"stay focused on John McCain\".</p> <p>Obama's bad week became worse when the National Rifle Association stepped up opposition to him. The NRA, which has millions of US supporters and had played little part in the campaign, sees Obama as hostile towards gun ownership.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-335160651\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1788670284_gdn-nat-080611-jd-gurkas-final-16x9.flv\"/> </video>   <p> Gyanendra Rai gazes at the smoke as it curls upwards from the funeral pyre and thins out over the rooftops of Pashuputi Nath, the world's most sacred Hindu temple. </p> <p>Rai thought of this place when artillery shrapnel chewed into the side of his back and right shoulder while he was fighting for the British army in the Falkland Islands: he imagined his body lying there on the cremation ghat.</p> <p>On June 11 1982, Lance Corporal Rai - a drummer with the 1st Battalion, 7th Gurkha Rifles - almost lost his life during the final assault on Port Stanley. Seriously injured, he received five pints of blood donated by British soldiers, and the skin that was grafted upon the cavernous hole in his back was taken from one of his fallen comrades.</p> <p>Rai still struggles from the pain in his side, and when it thunders his mind scares itself back to that terrifying day. Now, however, Rai is involved in a battle not with his demons but the British government. He is leading a claim against the Home Office's refusal to grant settlement to Gurkha veterans who served Britain but retired from the regiment before July 1997 because they \"failed to demonstrate strong ties to the United Kingdom\". Next Tuesday, the case of 15 former Gurkhas and Gurkha widows - representing more than 2,000 of their former colleagues - will return to the high court in London. </p> <p>A team of human rights lawyers is challenging the lawfulness of the decisions to refuse these men entry visas to the UK. It wants equal rights for those who retired before the regiment's headquarters moved from Hong Kong to the UK following the 1997 handover of the colony to China. </p> <p>Almost 1,000 Gurkha veterans - many with more than two decades of exemplary service - have been refused visa clearance by British embassies in Kathmandu, Hong Kong and Macau on the grounds that they do not have strong enough ties with the UK. The government argues that since they never lived in the UK, they have no real links with the country. It is estimated that between 7,000 and 10,000 more Gurkha veterans would settle in Britain should they win the case. Rai, who served as a drummer and machine gunner for 13 years and 81 days, asked for a settlement visa because he seeks medical treatment - unavailable in Nepal - for his physical wound and the mental scars he says still shake him. His application was refused in October 2006.</p> <p>\"I needed blood and flesh for a skin graft and my fellow British soldiers gave me that. So, how can they say I don't have strong ties? I have literally English blood running in my body. I have played drums at the Edinburgh military tattoo, at Buckingham Palace and St James's Palace. I have played for Prince Charles and Princess Anne,\" said Rai. \"When we are recruited we touch the union jack and we make an oath of allegiance to the UK and our Queen.\" </p> <p>On Monday, a delegation of Gurkhas will hand in a petition to Downing Street in protest at the government's position, before walking to the Gurkha Memorial in Whitehall to pay tribute to their fallen comrades. On Tuesday, they will be joined outside the high court by the actor Joanna Lumley, whose father served with the Gurkhas for 30 years. She said: \"Like so many people in Britain I am ashamed at how successive governments have failed these magnificent and loyal soldiers. The overwhelming wish of the British is to allow them to live with us if they so choose. I sincerely hope the court finds in their favour.\"</p> <p>Martin Howe is one of the British lawyers representing these men. This summer, he and his colleagues travelled across Nepal to hear the Gurkhas' stories. At one rally, organised by the Gurkha Army Ex-Servicemen's Organisation, which is supporting the case, more than 1,000 former Gurkhas and their families were gathered in a hall in Pokhara, a town that nestles in the foothills of the Annapurna massif, to hear him speak. </p> <p>\"You have travelled sometimes days, certainly hours to come to this meeting today. You have one last great battle, but this time it is with the pen and not the sword. You are involved in an epic fight for equality and justice, and that is a fight for justice for all Gurkhas and not just those who retired after 1 July 1997,\" said Howe. </p> <p>A pot of lentils lies simmering in the fire which burns in a hole in the mud-baked floor of Ratna Bahadur Gurung's hilltop home. His brother pulls the rope on a primitive churn, turning buffalo milk into ghee. They are subsistence farmers and the leftover ghee that he sells to his neighbours in the village of Lamsekhor provides Gurung with \"pocket money\". In the hard terrain of step-terraced fields, they farm millet, maize, rice and cucumbers. Theirs is a meagre existence; there is no toilet or electricity in the house and Gurung sleeps on a worn rattan mattress on the outside porch, beside a basket of chicks.</p> <p>In the face of this hardship, Gurung borrowed \u00a3500 - the equivalent of five years' average salary in Nepal - to pay the visa fee required by VFS Global, a company employed by the British embassy in Kathmandu. He hoped that he would be allowed to travel to the UK, where he has family, but in February 2007 his application was refused. Now he has joined the campaign to achieve the same rights for all Gurkhas.</p> <p>\"I just want to tell the British people that all the Gurkha soldiers are the same and that the government should treat them the same way and give them the visa without dividing them with 1997,\" said Gurung. Lifting the knife he uses in his fields, he motions with it across his long grey beard: \"I started growing this when they refused my visa to go to Britain. I will cut this beard when I get the visa and then I'll go to UK.\"</p> <p>Lalit Gurung lives in Pokhara but could not make the town hall meeting with his lawyers. He is so sick he has to be carried downstairs on his son's back should he wish to leave the first-floor flat in which he and his family live. The 81-year-old former Gurkha gave 24 years' service to Britain, and was promoted through the ranks to captain. He was awarded the Military Cross for bravery for his part in fierce fighting during the revolution in Brunei in 1963. His three younger brothers all served under his command - all four Gurungs joining the Gurkhas because their father and grandfather had done so before them.</p> <p>On the walls of his living room, Gurung displays images of the day he was awarded the MC by Prince Philip, of his meeting with Denis Healey, of the serried rows of himself and his fellow officers after they completed the small arms course at Hythe barracks in Kent in 1958. He talks with pride of his commanding officer, Sir Jeremy \"JJ\" Moore, who also received the MC for the same battle as Gurung and went on to receive the surrender of Argentine forces on the Falklands.</p> <p>Twelve years ago, a stroke left Gurung paralysed down one side of his body. He is now diabetic, has partial vision, sores, ulcers and fractures. He has to be helped to the toilet. In a medical report, Gurung's doctors say he \"would definitely have a better quality of life if treated and rehabilitated in the UK\". </p> <p>It says: \"Facilities to manage such a case in Nepal are not perfect and of limited quality. Relatively better facilities are available only in private hospitals that are very expensive and that the patient may not be able to afford. The patient has unfortunately been getting additional complications such as sores, ulcers, fractures and blindness due to lack of proper care and support.\"</p> <p>Gurung was forced to make an arduous seven-hour car journey to Kathmandu to apply for a visa to travel to the UK for medical treatment. He could not afford the \u00a3500 fee and lodged the application without it, asking the entry clearance officer to use her discretionary powers to admit him. The refusal to even consider the case without the fee is being challenged in a British court in a test case which may relieve the financial burden for all Gurkhas. </p> <p>Gurung weeps and beats his walking stick on the floor as he speaks of his years as a Gurkha and how he feels betrayed by the imposition of the 1997 cut-off date. He spent almost a year in Britain, and took language courses. Now, his daughter lives there and he feels betrayed that he cannot. </p> <p>\"Our forefathers fought the first world war and we fought the second world war and we are the same as the rest of the British army, we don't consider ourselves to be different. We are still waving the British flag, the union jack. We Gurkhas and the British fought and won against the Germans and Japan as well. We gave so many lives for them, for the British government. But when we are so much in need of help, there isn't a single person to help us. That is what I want to say to them. Even when we are so sick they don't care. We have got nothing. We fought for the British king and the British people but now we are in such a poor condition. They are not taking care of us and there is no benefit for us. I want all the British citizens to know about our poor condition.\" </p> <p>Men like Lalit Gurung have been associated with the British army for almost 200 years - at that time the two were foes following raids by Nepalese fighters into British territory in India. After waging war on Nepal, a British peace treaty was followed by the need for volunteers for the East India Company's army, which then formed the first Gurkha Brigade. </p> <p>By the first world war, 100,000 Gurkhas had enlisted and during the second world war there were 40 Gurkha battalions in British service. During these two wars, and in other conflicts, they suffered 45,000 casualties. Gurkhas have won 26 Victoria Crosses - 13 by Nepalese and 13 by their British officers, more than any other regiment.</p> <p>In 1931, Sir Ralph Turner wrote of the Gurkhas with whom he had served: \"Uncomplaining, you endure hunger and thirst and wounds; and at the last your unwavering lines disappear into the smoke and wrath of battle. Bravest of the brave, most generous of the generous, never had a country more faithful friends than you.\"</p> <p>The Brigade of Gurkhas was fully integrated into the British army in 1947. Over the years it has gained a reputation as a formidable fighting force. Recently, Gurkhas have served in Iraq, Afghanistan, Bosnia, Kosovo and Sierra Leone.</p> <p>This year, 50 Gurkhas handed in their long service and good conduct medals in protest at the 1997 cut-off date. The campaign to allow settlement for all Gurkhas has cross-party support - Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat leader, asked Gordon Brown, at prime minister's questions \"why on Earth he believes that Gurkhas who served ... after 1997 are worth British citizenship but those who served before that date should be deported?\" Many Gurkha veterans have become involved not because they wish to live in the UK but as a matter of principle. </p> <p>A petition lodged on the Downing Street website which calls on \"the prime minister to give all ex-Gurkha soldiers and their families who have served our country British citizenship on leaving the service\" has so far gathered 27,668 signatures. </p> <p>The Ministry of Defence argues that it was not until the brigade became UK-based that Gurkhas developed sufficient ties with the country. A spokesman for the Home Office told the Guardian: \"The government has tried to be as fair as possible in its treatment of armed forces veterans - including ex-Gurkhas. </p> <p>\"Under the immigration rules, the grant of settlement in the UK is normally linked to an extended period of residence in the UK or the presence of a close family tie. Gurkhas discharged before 1 July 1997 would not normally have developed strong residential ties with the UK. This was the date that the Gurkhas became a UK-based force on completion of the withdrawal from Hong Kong. </p> <p>\"Whenever there are strong reasons why settlement in the UK is appropriate any Gurkha can apply for settlement on a discretionary basis no matter when they were discharged. Where a person has been refused further leave, there is a full right of appeal against the decision to the independent courts.\"</p> <p>Tul Bahadur Pun, 85, was awarded the Victoria Cross and 10 other medals but was initially refused entry to the UK. But in June 2007, the decision was overturned due to the \"exceptional\" nature of the case. </p> <p>Since then VC Pun [as he is commonly known] has had several operations, some for cataracts, and for the first time in 14 years can see the majestic Dhaulagiri mountain from the rooftop of his home in Pokhara. </p> <p>With a settlement visa, Pun resides only some of the time in the UK. \"I am getting better physically now that I am able to travel to the UK for treatment. But I cannot live there for long - it's really cold and I have a really hard time when it's cold. It is better for my health over there, here it is not good.\"</p> <p>For Lalit Gurung, the return journey to Kathmandu, and the days and days of waiting for a decision, took its toll. He is now sicker and more frustrated, ashamed to be carried in and out of the visa office and his home like a baby. </p> <p>Clutching his MC, arranged beside his other campaign medals, he said: \"The British citizens are happy and proud and they go around waving their flag because of whom? It's because of the Gurkhas, generations of Gurkhas.\"</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p>Gurkhas have served the <strong>British crown</strong> for almost two centuries. They became part of the British army following <strong>Indian independence</strong> in 1947. The brigade suffered <strong>45,000</strong> casualties during the two world wars and in other conflicts. Nepalese Gurkhas have won <strong>13 Victoria Crosses</strong>, and their British officers have won 13 - more than any other regiment. Gurkhas have served recently in Iraq, Afghanistan, Bosnia, Kosovo and Sierra Leone. The Gurkha<strong> motto</strong> is <strong>\"Better to die than to live a coward\".</strong></p>",
  "<p>Shares in Lehman Brothers slumped another 42% yesterday as confidence in the bank's ability to survive as an independent firm evaporated.</p> <p>The 158-year-old investment bank appeared last night to be pinning its hopes on finding a buyer as rumours swirled that chief executive Richard Fuld was hawking the firm to rivals. The latest slide in the bank's share price left it valued at under $3bn.</p> <p>The list of possible buyers included Bank of America, HSBC, Nomura, Goldman Sachs, BNP Paribas and Barclays, although ongoing concerns about the state of the Lehman balance sheet might make it difficult to agree a deal.

Bad bets on commercial real estate and residential mortgages have cost the bank billions of dollars.</p> <p>But the survival plan failed to convince Wall Street. Moody's, the credit rating agency, said Lehman would need to find a \"stronger financial partner\" while banks including Goldman and Citigroup lowered their ratings.</p> <p>\"The steps they're taking are being seen by Wall Street as too little, too late,\" said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies &amp; Co. \"You're looking at a company that was a $10bn company last week that is a $3bn company today.\"</p> <p>On Wednesday, Lehman announced losses of $3.9bn, the worst performance in its history. Its shares had fallen 55% this week before the latest decline. They closed at $4.22 yesterday, more than 90% below their 52-week high of $67.53.</p> <p>Investors fear that clients and key staff could walk out of the bank before it has time to complete its restructuring, further eroding confidence.</p> <p>Analysts were also concerned that none of the plans to restructure the business are done deals, and that potential pitfalls remain.</p> <p>Among the measures outlined by Lehman this week are spinning off most of its commercial property assets, around $30bn (\u00a317bn) worth, into a separate company and selling off $4bn of its UK residential mortgage portfolio to the private equity firm BlackRock.</p> <p>To conserve cash, the bank is slashing its year-end dividend from 68 cents to just 5 cents, a move that would save $450m.

  "<p>Wm Morrison, Britain's fourth largest supermarket group, expects food inflation to drop at the end of this year as the benefits of strong global harvests and reduced input costs feed through.</p> <p>Morrisons said its shelf price rises in recent months had stayed below the 6% rate seen in the wider grocery market, helped by strong promotions. Among popular deals over the summer months were a succession of offers including a series of \u00a34 meals for four such as barbecues, picnics and brunches.</p> <p>Chief executive Marc Bolland said Morrison's food processing operations enabled stores to offer these deals at a price other supermarkets would struggle to match. Noting the recent success of Aldi and Lidl, Bolland suggested Morrison's customers benefited from strong discounts combined with a wide range of fresh produce unavailable in many discount chains.</p> <p>Finance director Richard Pennycook said Morrisons was aware of the \"battering that is being taken by the consumer ... in a marketplace getting more difficult by the day\". </p> <p>However, the company pointed to a number of encouraging developments which it believes will feed through into lower inflation by the end of 2008. In particular, Bolland pointed to the falling oil price, a 3% increase in farming acreage worldwide, and strong wheat harvests in Australia, Ukraine, Canada and the US.</p> <p>He said falling commodity costs would begin to be reflected in stores just as the industry reached the anniversary of a sharp jump in food inflation around the end of 2008.</p> <p>Bolland was speaking after Morrisons announced comparable sales, excluding petrol, up 7.6% for the 26 weeks to August 3. Pre-tax profit rose 22% to \u00a3295m, slightly ahead of analysts' expectations.</p> <p>Bolland said the strongest growth had been in Scotland and London. Morrisons is a relatively small, new entrant in the capital, with just 22 stores on former Safeway sites. Despite scepticism, the Bradford-based chain is now showing 10% like-for-like sales growth in these areas.</p> <p>Almost \u00a3400m of sales - about 5% of Morrison's turnover - came from the petrol pumps after a 32% like-for-like rise in fuel sales. Much of this increase was down to price rises, but volumes were also up between 5% and 7%. Pennycook played down the significance of fuel sales: \"They provided no meaningful profit contribution. It was cash straight out of our customers' pockets and into the hands of the oil companies and sovereign wealth funds.\"</p> <p>Bolland warned investors not to expect the group's strong like-for-like sales to grow towards the end of the year as it faces tough comparisons around Christmas. \"The momentum of the first half has set us up well to achieve for the full year, despite the challenging comparatives as we approach Christmas,\" Bolland said.</p> <p>\"We fully expect the second half to be highly competitive as disposable incomes come under further pressure, and we will continue to use our sales momentum to fund price investment and maintain a strong competitive position.\"</p>",
  "<p>Garry Cook, the executive chairman of Manchester City, this week revealed plans for the club to become \"the Virgin of Asia and the world\". Before he proceeds with this scheme, though, one that could eventually see City-branded cars, food outlets, energy drinks and motorcycle helmets sold across the globe, he may want to consider the warnings of those whose expertise lies in enhancing commercial profiles and who are convinced Cook's desire to become the Richard Branson of football is a non-starter.</p> <p>\"The Virgin model that City want to replicate is not compatible with football for the simple reason that the sport polarises people,\" said Alan Cooper, partner at HPI Research, a marketing consultancy that works with Virgin. \"People establish allegiances in football which they don't in the business world and this immediately shrinks a club's customer base.\"</p> <p>Stressing his point, Cooper tells of the time Vodafone, during the period they sponsored Manchester United, were forced to remove all company logos from the exterior of its call centre in Leeds. Why? Because it was located 400 metres from Elland Road and so became a target for brick-happy home supporters irate that backers of their fiercest rivals had set up base there. </p> <p>Howard Robinson, of EDP Sports Marketing, believes a similar fate could befall \"McManCity\" should it ever open. \"Who exactly is going to eat at a Manchester City restaurant? Bolton fans won't, neither will Liverpool fans,\" he said. \"Nobody bar City fans would and while there may be a few more of them emerging in the next few years, the total figure is still going to be relatively small, nothing on the scale of what Virgin attracts to its various products.</p> <p>\"Man City's business is football and what they need to do first in terms of enhancing their brand is deliver a winning team on the pitch. If they don't then all these business plans will be irrelevant.\"</p> <p>That task should become easier now the Abu Dhabi United Group has bought a majority stake at Eastlands and with it the financial might to sign world-class players. The first has already arrived - Robinho for a British record \u00a332.5m fee - and, while doubts have been cast over the investment after an inconsistent spell for the Brazilian at Real Madrid, Cooper believes he could be a shrewd signing.</p> <p>\"What draws people from Asia and Africa, which are the key markets right now, to clubs is not just success but also a recognisable identity. Manchester United have successfully sold themselves abroad because they have a rich history to back up the trophies they've won. Real Madrid have done well in those places for similar reasons but also because of their gal\u00e1cticos policy which gave them the most recognisable team in the world. </p> <p>\"City need a similar, strong, identity and with Robinho it could be that of a side that plays with Brazilian flair.\" This is a sentiment shared by Robinson: \"City need to become attractive on the pitch to become attractive abroad. Not many people in Beijing are going to buy shirts with Richard Dunne's name on the back.\"</p> <p>What is for sure is that City have a long way to go before they can mimic Virgin, a company that has been going for almost 40 years, has 200 branded companies worldwide and annual revenue in excess of \u00a310bn. According to a recent poll carried out by management consultants BBDO, the club is not even one of the world's top-25 most recognisable football brands, even coming behind the likes of Lille in terms of global awareness and sales. </p> <p>\"If City really want to make their mark abroad they should look to tap into India. It is going to become the biggest country in terms of population by 2015 and is showing an appetite for football which so far no club has tried to satisfy,\" said Robinson. \"City could become massive there. That cause would undeniably be helped by signing an Indian player; that would spread the club's name across the country in an instant.\"</p> <p>City's motives are obvious at a time when English football has become a worldwide phenomenon but what appears unconvincing is the manner in which they intend to go global. \"Clubs more successful than City have not attempted to replicate Virgin so there is nothing to suggest they will pull it of,\" said Robinson. \"They need to come up with a strategy that has been thought through calmly and, perhaps, privately.\"</p>",
  "<p>Great expectations foundered on complexity yesterday when Gordon Brown unveiled an energy package which he had hoped might restore a warm glow to his political fortunes. Looking tense at his regular press conference, the Prime Minister managed to avoid lapsing into jargon, but he offered a witches' brew of schemes - social tariffs, Warm Front, Carbon Emissions Reduction Target and Community Energy Saving Programme - as an answer to rising bills. If one big idea could be discerned, it was a push to lag the nation's lofts. \"Half defrosted\" was the instant verdict from Help the Aged, which had hoped for something simpler to keep the chill at bay - a wad of cash, perhaps. The Labour left were equally dismayed because of the failure to impose a windfall levy on the energy giants. Others rightly pointed out that one element of the package merely reversed in part an earlier cut. </p> <p>Despite the chorus of carping, there was much to welcome in the devilish detail of the plans. Even without a windfall tax, ministers have succeeded in extracting a modest social dividend from the burgeoning coffers of power firms. Each of the biggest has been forced to contribute an extra \u00a350m to energy-saving funds - which do not just help with lagging the loft, but also with filling in wall cavities and buying new boilers. Such steps could reduce carbon emissions and - eventually - cut fuel bills. That is very much better than nothing. And in the week when a jury acquitted Greenpeace activists who claimed the damage they had done to Kingsnorth power station was aimed at preventing the greater crime of climate change, the government placed new responsibilities on generating firms, making them contribute for the first time.</p> <p>The weakness, however, is that all this will take time. Yesterday the prime minister spoke of 6m homes being insulated by 2011. Similar Brownian boasts in the past - his targets for housebuilding spring to mind - have failed to become a reality. But even if this one succeeds, asking someone who is already cold to shiver their way through another three winters before the lagging arrives is not an acceptable policy. Mr Brown went some way to answer that charge yesterday. He sharply increased the payment that is automatically added to the benefits of the poorest during cold snaps. That should help stop fuel poverty from developing into full-blown hypothermia, but this tightly targeted money is of no help to those who will struggle to make ends meet in conditions that are only slightly less chilly. And even after the insulation arrives, the millions of hard-up households who have neither lofts to lag nor wall cavities to fill will still feel short-changed. </p> <p>There are also all sorts of mundane but crucial questions about the practicalities. One obvious issue is ensuring that there are enough loft laggers in the business to fulfil Mr Brown's goals. Encouragingly, this week the skills department published plans to increase the workforce in such green industries. Equally important, however, is the need to ensure that the energy firms do not simply pass the cost of their contributions on to customers. The prime minister mumbled yesterday that Ofgem would deal with industry malpractice, but it is unclear how far it is inclined - or even able - to regulate the way firms respond to being asked to pay increased social contributions. More than anything else, though, the chances of greening millions of homes will turn on persuading people to apply. There is talk of a freephone helpline and an advertising campaign. It will need to be big enough to create quite an impression if it is to thrust obscure energy efficiency schemes into public consciousness.</p> <p>Much in energy policy is prosaic. A battered government in need of a political fix will not get much joy from publicising and planning the lagging of lofts. That does not stop it being a sensible thing to do. Minutiae it may be, but it matters.</p>",
  "<p>Margaret Thatcher is to return to Chequers tomorrow at the invitation of Gordon Brown, it emerged last night. The prime minister is expected to discuss the global downturn with the woman who dealt with some of Britain's toughest postwar economic conditions.</p> <p>In a departure from his high profile courting of Thatcher exactly a year ago, when she visited Downing Street in full view of the cameras, Brown has arranged for a low key lunch in the relative privacy of the prime minister's official country residence in Buckinghamshire.</p> <p> The lunch arose out of Brown's meeting with Thatcher in Downing Street last year when they discussed Chequers, where the former prime minister had one of her most famous moments in 1984 when she described then future Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev as a man she could \"do business with\". </p> <p>Brown told Thatcher last year she would be welcome to return to the retreat in the Chilterns. The meeting was timed to ensure that the weather would allow Thatcher to embark on a nostalgic walk through the grounds.</p> <p>Downing Street is likely to be careful to play down the political significance of tomorrow's meeting. Thatcher, who will celebrate her 83rd birthday next month, is in fragile health. Her daughter Carol said last month that the former prime minister has been suffering from dementia for at least seven years.</p> <p>Carol Thatcher said that her mother could have flashes of her \"old self\" particularly when events from her time in office are mentioned. While both sides will play down the political significance of the meeting, it is likely to resonate because Thatcher still sparks strong feelings across the spectrum. The right reveres her while many on the left believe she was responsible for the destruction of swathes of Britain's traditional manufacturing base.</p> <p>The meeting at Chequers is likely to be seen as a sign of the humble approach Brown plans to adopt during the political conference season as he tries to save his premiership by acknowledging the depth of the current economic difficulties. A one-to-one meeting with the Iron Lady, whose premiership was almost derailed by the dramatic rise in unemployment in the early 1980s, will show that Brown is prepared to take advice even from someone who remains highly controversial on the left.</p> <p>Brown will also handle tomorrow's lunch with care because his meeting with Thatcher last year had a mixed response. Some Tories were upset, believing that the prime minister was using a frail elderly woman to court middle England, during his \"Brown bounce\" in the polls.</p> <p>The Conservative leadership, which was unsettled by the meeting, took its time to respond. William Hague, shadow foreign secretary, eventually hit back on the opening day of the party's conference two weeks later when he accused Brown of using Thatcher to try to portray himself as a conviction politician.</p> <p>Hague won strong applause from the floor as he said: \"Could it be the same man who fought tooth and nail against every one of Lady Thatcher's vital reforms? Gordon Brown is not a conviction politician. He is a calculation politician. He calculates that he can pretend to be a new government. But he is the old government, and after 10 years of failure and disappointment, he cannot be the change the country needs.\"</p> <p>As a young backbencher in the 1980s Brown was a fierce critic of Thatcher. But they once had a civil meeting in private after she was struck by a speech he made in the House of Commons.</p>",
  "<h2>Drivers caught out as photocard licences expire</h2> <p>Thousands of drivers could be unwittingly breaking the law because they do not realise that their photocard licence has expired, motoring organisations said yesterday. Those who do remember to renew will have to pay \u00a317.50, a charge the RAC has branded \"unreasonable\". Reminder letters are sent out by the DVLA two months before the expiry date. But the DVLA admits that more than 4,000 drivers whose licences had expired by the end of August had yet to apply for a renewal. The new-style licences, launched in July 1998, expire after 10 years, unlike the paper ones they replaced. <br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Soldier killed trying to defuse roadside bomb</h2> <p>A British soldier has been killed in an explosion in southern Afghanistan while trying to defuse a roadside bomb.

He is the 118th member of the British armed forces to be killed in Afghanistan since military operations against the Taliban and al-Qaida began in 2001.

Max Kingsley, 59, from Margate, Kent, was convicted of 12 counts of illegally providing immigration advice. Kingsley's greed left some of his \"vulnerable\" clients thousands of pounds poorer, Southwark crown court in London was told. The court heard the Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner had rejected his application to register to offer immigration advice in 2001 but he invented an academic background and set up offices in Edgware Road, central London. <br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Water charges deferred to offset soaring fuel bills</h2> <p>Northern Ireland may defer the introduction of water charges to ease the pressure on consumers facing a winter of rising fuel costs, the first minister, Peter Robinson, said last night. It had been recommended that the charges be phased in from next year, but Robinson said: \"With rising bills, I believe it is not credible to place any greater burden on our citizens in the present dire global economic circumstances.\" His announcement came after it emerged that Northern Ireland was unlikely to benefit from a \u00a31bn aid package announced by Gordon Brown to help households fight rising fuel costs. <br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Did you order 2,000 pints of lager, ma'am?</h2> <p>Perhaps tourists at Windsor Castle thought the Queen was having a party when a lorry carrying 12 barrels of lager pulled up outside her Berkshire home. But after confusion among staff at the royal residence, it emerged the 2,000 pints were destined for a pub with the same name five miles away. Misko Coric, manager of the Windsor Castle pub in Maidenhead, said the beer, ordered for the England v Croatia football match, finally turned up three hours late. He said: \"We have received mail for the royal household here before but I think this is the first time they have received anything meant for us.\" <br><strong>Laura Clout</strong></p> <h2>Want to look thinner?

  "<p>WD Mohammed, who has died aged 74, was the leader of the Nation of Islam (NOI) who brought the heterodox and separatist movement led by his father, Elijah Muhammad, into line with the mainstream of Sunni Islam. Under Elijah Muhammad, the NOI, founded by a mysterious street pedlar known as Master Muhammad Farad (also known as Fard), taught an eclectic mixture of doctrines, combining elements of protestant Armageddon theology with an Islamic philosophical and religious colouring. </p> <p>In 1934 Farad disappeared, leaving Elijah in charge of the movement. In the starkest contrast to orthodox Islamic teachings, Elijah Muhammad taught his African-American followers that the absent Farad was not just a prophet, but God, who is black, while claiming for himself the title of Messenger, which Muslims reserve for the Prophet Muhammad. In Elijah's teachings, white people - unlike those of African descent - were demonic creatures under Satan's dominion. God had allowed them to rule the earth temporarily, which explained colonialism, slavery, racism and poverty suffered by dark-skinned peoples. The time was now approaching when God would exterminate the white devils from the face of the earth in an apocalyptic global fire.</p> <p>Wallace Delaney (who would change his name to Warith Deen) was born in Hamtramck, Michigan, the seventh child of Elijah and Clara Muhammad. After completing high school at the NOI's University of Islam, he served in the movement's paramilitary section - the Fruit of Islam (FOI) - and as minister at its Philadelphia temple. In 1961 he received a three-year jail sentence for refusing the military draft. He spent his time in prison engaged in Islamic studies and realised that his father's teachings did not conform to mainstream Islam. </p> <p>On his release, he defected from the NOI to form his own group, the Afro-Descendant Upliftment Society, but after the assassination in February 1965 of Malcolm X, who had left the NOI for similar reasons, he returned to his father's fold. In prison, he had hoped to nurture the movement towards Sunnism, and was largely successful in this. Although twice suspended for his dissenting views, he was unanimously acclaimed leader on his father's death in February 1975 by 20,000 believers who had gathered in Chicago to commemorate the birth of Master Farad.</p> <p>On assuming the leadership, WD Mohammed (as his name was usually spelt) lost no time in changing the movement's direction. In June 1975 he opened membership to all believers, regardless of race. To prevent organised opposition and avoid the risk of a coup, he dissolved the paramilitary FOI. Fasting over Christmas was replaced by observance of Ramadan. </p> <p>Doctrinally, WD Mohammed reinterpreted his father's teachings to fit the orthodox paradigms of Sunni Islam. He explained that the messages presented by his father had been necessary when African-Americans were at the bottom of society. Once the doctrine had served its purpose of raising black consciousness, it should be replaced with more advanced teachings for further enlightenment. In a similar vein, the term \"white devil\" must be understood as an attitude of mind, not a racial category. The de-demonisation of the white man was matched by a de-deification of the black: when \"the Honourable Elijah Muhammad said you are the god,\" he would write, \"he meant you are a god on your own plane of activity\". In a bold stroke that resonates with the Shia doctrine of the Hidden Imam, WD Mohammed legitimised this change with reference to the NOI's formerly divinised founder: \"Master Farad Muhammad is not dead, brothers and sisters, he is physically alive and I talk to him whenever I get ready. I don't talk to him in any spooky way, I go to the telephone and dial his number.\" </p> <p>The process of Islamisation was further reflected in name changes. In 1976 the NOI became the World Community of al-Islam in the West (WCIW), later renamed the American Muslim Mission, and subsequently the Muslim American Society (MAS). Its temples were renamed mosques, and later \"masjids\" (the Arabic word for mosque). Ministers became \"imams\" with Warith Deen as chief imam.</p> <p>While the new direction yielded political and economic benefits, it also split the movement. In 1975 WD Mohammed met privately with the Egyptian president, Anwar Sadat, in Chicago; the following year he received $16m from the ruler of Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates for the purchase of a mosque and school. In 1977 Louis Farrakhan, a top NOI official who publicly disagreed with WD Mohammed's policies, took a minority of members with him to form the separatist group that became the \"restored\" Nation of Islam. Farrakhan has claimed that Elijah Muhammad is still alive and endorses his leadership, communicating with him from a \"mother ship\" in space.</p> <p>In 1978 WD Mohammed resigned as spiritual leader of the American Muslim Mission. Later, he disbanded his leadership council, enabling each mosque to become an independent entity while remaining affiliated to the MAS. Despite receiving funds from the Middle East and active collaboration with other Muslim organisations, the process of integration is far from complete. Muslims from south Asia, who form one of the most dynamically upwardly mobile groups in the US, tend to worship separately from African-American Muslims. Mosques, schools, businesses and organisations affiliated with the MAS retain their distinctiveness through separate conferences and networks.</p> <p>In 1992 WD Mohammed became the first Muslim imam to offer morning prayers in the US Senate. He participated in two inter-faith breakfasts hosted by President Clinton and was received in the Vatican by Pope John Paul II. </p> <p>He is thought to have had at least four wives and seven children.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Warith Deen Mohammed (Wallace Delaney Muhammad), religious leader, born October 30 1933; died September 9 2008</p>",

  "<p>Plans for tougher, pan-European regulation of the financial services sector as a result of the year-long credit turmoil would undermine the independence of rating agencies and could provoke a flight of capital, executives warned yesterday.</p> <p>Ian Bell, managing director of agency Standard &amp; Poor's, said European commission proposals to regulate the industry, due in mid-October, opened the door for EU supervisors to interfere with the credit ratings process and in effect force them to alter their ratings. </p> <p>Other agencies have warned Brussels the plans spell potential political interference.</p> <p>Ren\u00e9 Karsenti, head of the International Capital Markets Association, said plans to force banks and other finance houses to retain at least 10% of the asset-backed securities they issue would raise the cost of capital and put the European industry at a competitive disadvantage globally.</p> <p>Their comments came at a conference of leading politicians, industry executives and regulators, organised by think-tank Eurofi, on ways of restoring investor confidence, and on the eve of a two-day informal meeting of EU finance ministers to discuss ways to prevent and contain systemic risks on financial markets - and to escape economic recession.</p> <p>Rating agencies have been accused of being one cause of the \u20ac350bn (\u00a3280bn) asset write-downs, including \u20ac120bn in Europe, in the past year amid warnings further financial shocks could drive these upwards. Senior EC officials said they had identified \u20ac1 trillion of issued asset-backed securities, half of it in Europe. Moody's, another of the big agencies, has told the EC its plans are \"unworkable\".</p> <p>The plans will force agencies to register, subject themselves to pan-European regulators and improve their corporate governance to avoid conflicts of interest with their client customers, including plans to rotate analysts every four years. </p> <p>Bell, S&amp;P head of structured finance for Europe, Africa and Middle East, said the proposals seemed to treat the ratings process as scientific, whereas mistakes were inevitable. \"The provisions of the draft regulation are for regulators to have a direct influence on a variety of aspects of our work ...

  "<p>Jonathan Freedland offers a new twist in American presidential politics: blackmail (The world's verdict will be harsh if the US rejects the man it yearns for, September 10). If we don't elect the man he prefers, we will incur the wrath of the world. Worse, they might conclude we are racists, and then our world would truly collapse around us. Mr Freedland and his friends might subject us to another rant in the Guardian, or - God forbid - denounce us in the UN. As much as we Americans fear the world's verdict, we insist on this annoying ritual of choosing our own leaders every four years. If the \"Elect Obama or I'll kill your dog\" tactic doesn't work, we may just wake up in November and realise we have \"passed up a once-in-a-generation chance for a fresh start\". Pity.</p> <p>To address the sinking feeling in Mr Freedland's stomach, I offer this advice: quit following the presidential race. It's doing you no good.

Sarah Palin is a conservative extremist and her popularity is downright scary. If the citizens of the US vote McCain-Palin (or, more correctly, Palin-McCain) into the White House, I will conclude there is no intelligence remaining in most of America. We will have an extremist theocracy. But then the people will get what they deserve and should be ridiculed for making a bad choice (again). Probably the best outcome would be for the UK, Europe, Russia and the rest of the world to leave the US in the dust, surging ahead, as the US continues its \"historical decline\". Maybe that would take Americans off their high horses.<br><strong>Ann Ornitz</strong><br> Creve Coeur, Missouri, USA </p> <p>I have a small but significant piece of evidence that the world is desperate to rediscover its esteem for America and its people. At a recent international theatre gathering of young people in Liverpool - a diverse mix of about 250, ages between 16 and 25, from countries including Palestine, Nepal, Turkey, Brazil, India, Poland, Zambia, and Germany - a group from the US presented a play about race issues. There was a passing reference to Obama and a hope expressed that he will become the next president. This whole gathering - with all its wide differences of cultures, faiths, and economic, social and political backgrounds - rose to its feet as one body with a mighty cheer and applauded. If only the people of American could hear that message.<br><strong>Noel Greig</strong><br>Deal, Kent </p> <p>Jonathan Freedland finds it \"incredible\" that Barack Obama's positive reception abroad would harm his standing in the US. In fact, the early stages of Obama's world tour were well received and produced a bounce in his poll numbers. His Berlin speech reversed these gains not because of any isolationism on the part of the US electorate, but because it reinforced two damaging narratives about his candidacy. First, his vapid rhetoric spoke of an empty suit whose oratorical skills contrast sharply with his lack of substantive accomplishments and thin r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Second, in seeking to appear \"presidential\" in front of 200,000 foreigners, Obama foolishly blurred the line between a presumptive and a presumptuous nominee. His global popularity is less of an electoral liability than his perceived arrogance and elevation of style over substance.<br><strong>Alex Lindenberg</strong><br> Brighton, East Sussex </p> <p>Jonathan Freedland made my blood boil here in Sacramento, as he whines about our elections, like a spoiled child. Neither he nor any Englishman, Frenchman, Russian, African or Ecuadorian has the slightest say in our elections. The issues are vastly too complex for foreigners to comprehend, much less have a say in. I don't see anyone of Pakistani or African descent being touted as Britain's next prime minister. But to childishly simplify everything through the lens of skin colour defines the left's congenital stupidity. America saved Europe during three world wars, including the Cold War. Our blood, sweat and tears were not shed to have weaklings tell us how to save the world (by continuously selling out millions of \"other people\" to totalitarian monsters). Should Jonathan visit, he had better drink with professors or like types at home or in gay bars, but had better stay out of real bars in Sacramento.<br><strong>Miguel Giles</strong><br> Carmichael, California, USA </p> <p>It isn't so much that Sarah Palin has tipped the balance in polls, she has just hastened what would have been inevitable. McCain has no star quality, but he is white. Having lived in the US for two years, working as a nanny on Long Island, I encountered virulent racism while listening in the background at pool and dinner parties of the \"enlightened\" middle classes, even within earshot of their mostly black maids. It matters not how superior Obama may be as a candidate; come November, he is just a black man.<br><strong>Maggie Harris</strong><br> Crowborough, East Sussex </p> <p>Sarah Palin has certainly raised the profile of the Republican campaign, but that highlights media coverage, particularly in the UK, overwhelmed by Obama charisma to the extent they have not taken seriously McCain.

  "<p>Councils are not snooping for snooping's sake: they are seeking to detect illegal activity, say the Local Authorities Coordinators of Regulatory Services (Lacors). They acknowledge there may have been instances of over-zealous use of their investigatory powers by some councils, but 99% of the time, they say, these investigations lead to some form of prosecution or action. What's more, councils have always undertaken such investigations; the extension of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act legislation to local authorities simply made the processes more transparent. And with transparency comes publicity, often unwelcome. </p> <p>\"Councils sometimes fail to understand is why this should be such a touchy issue,\" Lacors says. It is working with the Home Office on a set of guidelines that will provide advice on these fraught areas. </p> <p>In his annual report, published in July, Sir Christopher Rose, the chief surveillance commissioner, said that local authorities use covert surveillance only as a last resort, but granted the need for a public debate. \"It is not acceptable,\" he wrote, \"to judge that because directed surveillance is being conducted from a public place, this automatically renders the activity overt or to assert that an activity is proportionate because it is the only way to further an investigation \u2026 I encourage any debate which assists in educating the public and which enables authorising officers to judge proportionality better.\"</p> <p><strong>Obstructions </strong></p> <p>Rose noted the rising number of Freedom of Information requests about surveillance, to which, he said, local authorities had responded \"inconsistently\". Councils not giving out information readily may be deemed obstructive. </p> <p>Local authorities are struggling to find a balance between enforcement and intrusion. It's a matter of efficiency rather than political philosophy, according to Chris Leslie, director of the New Local Government Network, particularly in collecting data. \"There are better ways to use the data we all share as a society and feel is reasonable,\" says Leslie. The NLGN recently published a pamphlet proposing the abolition of the 10-year national census. \"Never mind intrusion, what we should be asking is whether it's cost-effective continually to be asking people to resupply the same data.\" </p> <p>Public attitudes are mixed: in some areas, cameras are welcomed for their calming influence. No one has yet protested about the use of CCTV by the Environment Agency to monitor spots where rivers might flood. </p> <p>What is curious is how little local authorities seem able to convey the benefits of their actions. Indeed, many seem almost wilfully oblivious to the effect of their actions, however well-meaning, on the public and, more pertinently, how they could be interpreted by a hostile press. </p> <p><strong>Alarmist stories </strong></p> <p>The media does have a lot to answer for. As Rose notes, FOI requests about surveillance are a rich seam for journalists. They have led to alarmist stories about local councils running surveillance operations. </p> <p>There's also confusion about the purposes of data collection and investigation. The London borough of Islington sifted through rubbish from 1,000 homes to see what people were throwing away and help improve recycling. That got short shrift in the press. But when people understand that data is being used for the greater good \u2013 as when health statistics are collected anonymously \u2013 they tend to be far more tolerant. </p> <p>So is this yet another area where the public sector has failed to get over its message?</p> <p><strong>Don't believe the hype</strong></p> <p>\"Council snoopers\" became one of the headlines of the summer as the press, led by the Daily Mail, rampaged \u2013 lumping together investigations into fraud, environmental policy with longstanding campaigns against identity registration and speed restrictions. </p> <p>Tory politicians clambered on the bandwagon with shadow home secretary Dominic Grieve claiming powers designed to combat terrorism were being used \"to snoop on the lives of ordinary people\". </p> <p>The re-election of David Davies as Tory MP for Haltemprice \u2013 he had resigned his seat in protest at the government's plans to hold terrorist suspects for 42 days \u2013 may increase the temperature over these issues of liberty and order, leaving local authorities and other public bodies between the proverbial rock and a hard place.</p> <p>Public policy is being made in bits and pieces. In July Sir Ian Magee, a former permanent secretary commissioned by the Home Office, recommended much more data sharing about criminals between government agencies. </p> <p>The government said it would give both MPs and the information commissioner more scrutiny over the use of surveillance. But the prime minister has been robust in defending what he called the \"right to use 21st century solutions\" in fighting terrorism and organised crime, such as cameras, biometrics and DNA databases.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>This article appears in this month's edition of the Guardian's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public\">Public</a> magazine</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama today made a belated personal appeal to Bill Clinton for advice on how to fight back against a resurgent Republican presidential campaign.</p> <p>The lunchtime meeting in New York between the two towering Democratic figures comes amid growing despair at Obama's slide in the polls over the last week. Democratic figures are openly expressing fears that Obama does not have a strategy to counter the rising appeal of John McCain and his running mate, Sarah Palin.</p> <p>Although Clinton extravagantly praised Obama in his speech to the Democratic convention in Denver last month, the relationship between the two has remained strained from the bitter Democratic primary campaign against Hillary Clinton earlier this year.</p> <p>The meeting, which took place at the headquarters of Clinton's foundation in Harlem, was their first face-to-face encounter since the primary season ended last June. The two men have spoken on the phone on only two occasions since Obama won the nomination.</p> <p>In an attempt to smooth the way for the meeting, Obama said he saw parallels between his own campaign and Clinton's in 1992: a relatively unknown politician fighting the Republicans against a backdrop of an ailing economy.</p> <p>\"You know, I've got lunch with Bill Clinton, which I'm looking forward to,\" he told David Letterman on Wednesday night. \"There's nobody smarter in politics and he is going to be, you know, he's going to be campaigning for us over the next eight weeks, which I'm thrilled by because, you know, the race that he ran in '92 is -- it was similar to what's taking place now.\"</p> <p>Clinton extended the lunch offer to Obama about a week ago -- before Palin began to energise the Republican base -- after patiently waiting for months for the Democratic candidate to get in touch.</p> <p>If they had met earlier, it would have been characterised as Obama meeting Clinton from a position of strength, but coming this week, it adds to the sense of Obama being on the defensive and needing help putting his campaign back on course.</p> <p>Obama said Clinton had been successful in reaching out to people in 1992 on the economy and he would like to use him in that role in this campaign, telling people \"why we need to change the economy in a fundamental way so it works for middle class families so that they can get ahead, so that they can send their kids to college, I think he can be a great advocate on behalf of the campaign.\"</p> <p>Hillary Clinton has been actively campaigning for Obama in battle line states. However, she has drawn a line against making personal attacks on Palin, Clinton insiders said.</p> <p>Clinton is happy to attack the Republicans over policy but not on personality, in part because she sees this as the role of the vice-presidential candidate, Joe Biden, but also because she thinks it is a strategic mistake to engage in personal criticism of Palin.</p> <p>However, Clinton did add to the Democrats' defence of Obama who has been under attack for using the phrase \"lipstick on a pig\" to describe McCain's recycled policies. Republicans have accused Obama of insulting Palin.</p> <p>Clinton dismissed the notion at a press conference today.<br>\"Barack has made this clear,\" she said. \"It was in no way meant as an affront.\" </p> <p>While Bill Clinton will also go out on the trail for Obama, the election timetable is narrowing.</p> <p>The former president has many commitments over the next few weeks, including his annual Global Initiative conference in New York later this month, which attracts leaders from the world to discuss</p> <p>A new poll out today showed Obama's poll lead slipping in a trio of battleground states that will determine the outcome of the election: Florida, Pennsylvania and Ohio.</p> <p>A Quinnipiac University poll showed McCain pulling away in Florida, with a lead of 50% to Obama's 43%. The Republican was narrowing the gap in Pennsylvania, with Obama on 48% and McCain 45%. Obama maintained his lead in Ohio, 49% to McCain's 44%.</p> <p>Officially, the Obama camp has tried to downplay the polls, saying they are not predictive of the outcome next November.</p> <p>However, there were signs this week of a concerted effort to push back against Republican attacks. One of Obama's closest advisers, Valerie Jarrett, told the Wall Street Journal today that Obama had told her in a phone conversation that he was not going to let Palin hijack media attention any longer. Echoing the view reached by Hillary Clinton and other senior Democrats, he told Jarret he would desist from personal attacks on Palin and \"stay focused on John McCain\".</p> <p>Obama's bad week became worse when the National Rifle Association stepped up its opposition to him. The association, which has millions of supporters in the US and has so far played little part in the campaign, sees Obama as hostile towards gun ownership.</p>",
  "<p>Yesterday, the McCain campaign released an advert that featured video footage of Barack Obama saying \"But, you know, you can't \u2013 you can put lipstick on a pig; it's still a pig,\" and labeled that footage \"Barack Obama On: Sarah Palin,\" thus implying the Democratic presidential nominee was calling GOP veep nominee Sarah Palin a pig. The ad has since been <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0908/CBS_takes_down_McCain_webad_suggests_its_misleading.html?showall\">pulled</a>, because the campaign also used footage of CBS anchor Katie Couric without securing the proper permission first (<a href=\"http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1594443/20080909/heart.jhtml\">an</a> <a href=\"http://blog.wired.com/music/2008/08/mccain-sucks-at.html\">ongoing</a> <a href=\"http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/07/mccain-campai-1.html\">problem</a> with the McCain campaign \u2013 or, perhaps more evidence of McCain's emulation of Bush, showing up in his contempt for the law).</p> <p>Viewed in the context of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPd4yk0x-eg\">the stump speech</a> from which the \"lipstick on a pig\" line was pulled, it's clear that Obama was not directly calling Palin a pig:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"John McCain says he's about change, too. And, so, I guess his whole angle is: Watch out, George Bush. Except for economic policy, healthcare policy, tax policy, education policy, foreign policy, and Karl Rove-style politics, we're really gonna shake things up in Washington. That's not change. That's just calling something, the same thing, something different. But, you know, you can't \u2013 you can put lipstick on a pig; it's still a pig.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The pig in question is John McCain's policies, not Sarah Palin.</p> <p>But was it still sexist?</p> <p>Obama's had what we'll call a bit of a problem using <a href=\"http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2008/01/fighting-sexism-is-meant-to-be.html\">sexist</a> <a href=\"http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2008/02/what-new-dissed-hill-is-this.html\">dog</a> <a href=\"http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2008/02/periodically-speaking.html\">whistles</a> and <a href=\"http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2008/05/tell-me-he-did-not-really-say-this.html\">soubriquets</a>, and his campaign has not been above using <a href=\"http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2008/01/heydid-you-know-hillarys-big-girly.html\">overt sexism</a> and engaging in <a href=\"http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2008/06/why-taking-high-ground-is-important.html\">double standards</a> when it's suited him. And it's no secret that I think he's got to improve the way he speaks (at minimum) about women's issues, from <a href=\"http://www.feministe.us/blog/archives/2008/02/28/words-mean-things-part-2/\">reproductive</a> <a href=\"http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2008/07/putting-obama-comments-on-third-term.html\">rights</a> to <a href=\"http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2008/09/i-write-letters_11.html\">AIDS prevention</a>.</p> <p>It's a misconception that I'm hard on Obama for this stuff because I don't like him; the truth is that I want him to beat John McCain \u2013 no, not just beat him: I want him to trounce John McCain by double digits and ensure that the man never comes within 100 yards of the White House unless on a tourist excursion during his long overdue retirement. (Not because he's old, but because he sucks.) I'm hard on Obama because I don't want him to win on the back of misogyny and because I want him to be solid on women's issues, which will help him win.</p> <p>But the point is, I'm hard on him. And calling his \"lipstick on a pig\" line sexist?</p> <p>Doesn't fly.</p> <p>It might have been a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/01/johnmccain.uselections2008\">dog whistle</a> \u2013 except for the fact that dog whistles have to make some sort of sense. In the context of Obama talking about McCain's policies, and how are in perfect alignment with Bush's policies, suddenly implying Sarah Palin's a pig is utterly nonsensical. It's a non sequitur. However, implying that McCain's dressing up the same old shit as change is like putting lipstick on a pig, well, that makes sense.</p> <p>If Obama had been talking about Palin being added to the ticket, and how, even though she's a woman, she embraces the same anti-feminist policies as every other bloody Republican, and that's no more real change than putting lipstick on a pig is, <em>that</em> would be a dog whistle. Context matters \u2013 and if that's the context we were talking about, I would be writing something very different indeed.</p> <p>But that's not what happened.</p> <p>It was nonetheless exceptionally tone-deaf; Palin had, merely a week earlier, taken to the national stage and firmly associated herself with the image of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/04/uselections2008.sarahpalin\">a pitbull in lipstick</a>. Inevitably, the \"lipstick on a pig\" line was going to invoke that widely-discussed bit of Palin's address, and Obama should have known to lay off of it. There's no reason to hand the most mendacious people in the world stuff to use against you.</p> <p>And use it against him they did \u2013 positioning themselves as some sort of feminist crusaders, even as they simultaneously <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LK4oWay1VbE\">cast their own veep candidate</a> as a helpless damsel being stalked by wild animals.</p> <p>It's breathtakingly audacious, and just as infuriating.</p> <p>Because here's the thing about the GOP erroneously playing \"the gender card\" by co-opting feminist rhetoric and twisting it into some funhouse mirror version of feminism to be wielded as a weapon against the Democrats: It contributes to a cultural environment in which legitimate complaints about sexist rhetoric are already not taken as seriously as they should be, where they are routinely dismissed with charges of hypersensitivity and hysteria. That the GOP will further discredit feminism in the process of destroying Obama is not a flaw of this strategy, but a feature.</p> <p>That's bigger than Obama \u2013 and that's why I'm hard on him.</p> <p>He can't give them anything.</p> <p>Not an inch. Not a word.</p> <p>They don't fight fair.</p> <p>And they don't care a whit about sexism, except insofar as it can be used to their advantage \u2013 like being levied as a charge against an opponent. Even when he isn't being sexist.</p>",

  "<p>It's been an unsettling year to be a Kingsnorth. Blessed with a surname which for most of my life people have found it impossible to spell, I'm suddenly all over the news. But not in a good way. </p> <p>I keep hearing that Kingsnorth is filthy and destructive and should not, under any circumstances, be allowed to expand. Everywhere I turn, people are talking about fighting Kingsnorth, <a href=\"http://www.nonewcoal.org.uk/\">stopping Kingsnorth</a> or shutting down Kingsnorth (shutting up <a href=\"http://paulkingsnorth.net/\">Kingsnorth</a> I'm more familiar with). Thousands of angry hippies have been converging on wet fields threatening to chain themselves to bits of Kingsnorth. There are even \"stop Kingsnorth\" T-shirts. Maybe this is how it feels to be Ian Huntley. </p> <p>Still, even I was impressed when six <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/\">Greenpeace</a> activists managed to climb up the inside of the main chimney of the Kingsnorth coal-fired power station in Kent last October. Once at the top, they abseiled down the side and began daubing a giant and unequivocal message to the government on it. The message was intended to be \"Gordon, bin it!\" Unfortunately the police managed to serve an injunction on them by helicopter halfway through the process, so the message ended up as the rather less impressive \"Gordon\".</p> <p>A chimney named Gordon might seem more like a Turner prize contender than one of the obvious turning points in the long, uphill battle to prevent climate change. But a turning point it may turn out to be, for after an expensive and extremely detailed trial at Maidstone crown court, the six climbers were yesterday found <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/11/activists.kingsnorthclimatecamp\">not guilty</a> of causing criminal damage, despite the fact that they had openly admitted to doing so.</p> <p>The reason, unlike the case for the defence, was simple. The jury had decided to accept the climbers' case that the damage they did was justifiable if it helped prevent the undeniably greater damage that would be done by climate change. This is not the first time that a jury has accepted a \"lawful excuse\" defence in a criminal damage case \u2013 but it is the first time it has happened in relation to climate change. It will doubtless make Gordon (the prime minister, not the chimney) nervous as he contemplates whether or not to go-ahead with a new coal plant at Kingsnorth; a decision which will ultimately decide whether or not the UK has <a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2008/08/05/coal-scuttled/\">any chance</a> of meeting its targets to reduce its climate-changing emissions, and on which the cabinet apparently remains <a href=\"http://www.redorbit.com/news/business/1312868/cabinet_split_over_new_coalfired_power_station/index.html\">split</a>.</p> <p>Whether or not the court decision leads to a rash of similar protests elsewhere remains to be seen. Whether it ultimately helps to stop climate change \u2013 if that is even possible given the point we've reached and the demands of our resource-greedy global economy \u2013 remains to be seen too. But what it maybe could do \u2013 and certainly should do \u2013 is bring home to the UK, where we still all have our heads stuck firmly in the sand, the connection between action and consequence.</p> <p>The court in Maidstone <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/10/activists.carbonemissions\">heard</a> from James Hansen of Nasa, one of the world's leading climate experts, that the carbon dioxide emitted daily by Kingsnorth could be responsible for the extinction of up to 400 species. They heard that properties just down the road from Gordon the chimney, on the Kent coast, were already suffering from sea level rises. They heard from Inuit leader Aqqaluk Lynge about how Inuit houses were already sliding into the sea. They decided that such things justified the criminal damage that the climbers had done. In other words, they accepted the connection between powering British homes and the rapidly-altering global climate.</p> <p>The difficulty with the climate change <a href=\"http://climatedenial.org/\">narrative</a> has always been how big it is. The idea that turning on your kettle helps to drown polar bears has never really sunk in with many people at any level beyond the theoretical. Maybe \u2013 just maybe \u2013 the Kingsnorth verdict, with the full weight of the law backing it up, will make that link clearer in our minds. If it does, perhaps all that persecution will have been worth it.</p>",
  "<p>Shares in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/lehmanbrothers\">Lehman Brothers</a> slumped another 44% on Wall Street today, sending fresh jitters through global share markets as fears mounted that the beleaguered investment bank will become the latest victim of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">credit crunch</a>.</p> <p>The fresh slide, to just $4.08 a share, comes a day after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/11/lehmanbrothers.banking\">Lehman had attempted to calm investors' nerves by rushing out its third-quarter results</a> and announcing a series of measures to raise cash and cut its exposure to the property market.</p> <p>The restructuring appeared to have won the bank some time but by late afternoon yesterday, the shares had begun to fall again, partly because of a warning from the credit ratings agency Moody's that Lehman would need to take more drastic action. The agency said Lehman was facing a \"crisis of confidence\".</p> <p>A number of broker downgrades this morning added to the pressure. Lehman shares had already fallen 55% so far this week before today's further declines.</p> <p>Lehman dragged down other financial stocks, sending the Dow Jones industrial average slumping by more than 100 points. In London, the FTSE 100 was almost 90 points lower at 5276.8, with financials leading the losses. </p> <p>Merrill Lynch shares were off 17% and AIG, the insurance firm, was down 16%. Citigroup and Bank of America were off 4%.</p> <p>Part of the renewed anxiety over Lehman focused on whether the bank might run out of time in its efforts to rebuild confidence. It was noted that most of the measures outlined on Wednesday were promises of future fundraising, including the auction of a 55% stake in its asset management arm, rather than solid done deals.</p> <p>There are concerns that the erosion of confidence could lead key staff to begin walking out, hindering its ability to do those deals, and that Lehman's cost of borrowing could rise sharply, further eroding its capital base.</p> <p>The markets have been on alert since the near collapse of Bear Stearns earlier this year. But Lehman does at least have the advantage of the special loan programme created by the US government for the Wall Street banks in the wake of the Bear Stearns failure.</p> <p>Among the measures outlined by Lehman earlier this week, the bank said it intends to spin most of its commercial property assets, around $30bn (\u00a317bn), into a separate company. It is also selling off $4bn of its UK residential mortgage portfolio to the private equity firm BlackRock.</p> <p>To conserve cash, the bank is slashing its year-end dividend from 68 cents to just 5 cents, a move that will save $450m. Lehman said it has reduced its global headcount by around 1,500 workers over the past quarter.</p> <p>In addition, the embattled investment bank said it is in talks to sell off a 55% stake in its lucrative investment management division, which includes the asset manager Neuberger Berman. Analysts reckon the division is worth about $10bn.</p>",
  "<p>As reported today <a href=\"www.compassonline.org.uk\">Compass</a> takes on the New Conservatives in an ebook published by <a href=\"www.soundings.org.uk\">Soundings</a> journal, <a href=\"http://www.lwbooks.co.uk/conservative.pdf\">Is the Future Conservative? (pdf)</a>. </p> <p>The New Conservatives have a commanding lead in the polls, but in truth there is no great upswelling of popular feeling for them, only a jaundiced contempt for the government. Popular disaffection is Britain's political crisis.</p> <p>It's time for a national debate about the country's future. This autumn Comment is Free and Soundings will make their contribution. We're jointly organising a series of Guardian public debates, <a href=\"http://www.lwbooks.co.uk/seminar4.html\">Who owns the progressive future?</a> at <a href=\"www.kingsplace.co.uk\">Kings Place</a> . </p> <p>We're asking Cifers to play a central part in the debates. This is going to be a political event in the blogosphere, not just in London. There'll be blogs and commentary on Cif and after three days they will be transferred to the Soundings website where those who want to can continue a longer-term debate. But we hope it will extend to other blogs and websites.</p> <p>What does \"progressive\" mean? Who isn't for progress? The gamut now runs across the political spectrum. In the last few years \"progress\" seems to mean little more than a permanent restructuring of the status quo. <a href=\"http://www.compassonline.org.uk/article.asp?n=982\">Gordon Brown calls for a \"progressive consensus\"</a>. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/dec/16/conservatives.liberaldemocrats\">David Cameron attempts to trump him</a> with his \"progressive alliance\". The New Conservatives promise \"progressive goals by conservative means\", Labour, the \"true progressives\" scoff at the idea. To be a progressive, says Richard Reeves of <a href=\"www.demos.co.uk\">Demos</a>, is to believe, \"that societies ought to move forward and that the measure of advance is the expansion of freedoms and life chances\". That used to mean being a socialist. </p> <p>And yet, in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/10/conservatives\">yesterday's Guardian</a>, Demos rewards the Conservatives' pro-academy, privatising, backward-looking, inequality-producing education policies with a high \"progressive\" rating. Right now, politics is full of such contradictions. </p> <p>We are now in a crucial battle of political language. Whoever defines the terms of debate will own the political future. Both New Labour and the New Conservatives swap policies, triangulate and reposition themselves, vying for the limelight of the rightward moving political centre. Spurred on by focus groups, the latest poll ratings, and fear of the scabrous London media, they evade confronting the public with the pressing problems we face. Britain's political elite must, like water, follow the path of least resistance. In our governing political culture today there is not much leadership and little plain speaking to truth. </p> <p>For the left, taking on the New Conservatives cannot be separated from the need to create a post-New Labour social democracy. It has to go back to the people and it has to be willing to tackle the destructive impact of liberal market capitalism. We need to renew the tradition of ethical socialism and our commitment to the moral value of equality. We have to reject the easy option of marketisation and instead find the means to democratise public services and build an accountable, redistributive state. Power needs devolving back to local government with all the problems this will entail for equity. There has to be constitutional and electoral reform and the protection and extension of individual civil liberties. The trade unions need supporting. They're the biggest civil society organisation and central to the development of a more equal and just society. </p> <p>After the moral and political disaster of Iraq, Britain needs a new internationalism. And last, we have to deal with the emergencies of climate change, peak oil, water scarcity and food insecurity. We need a <a href=\"http://www.neweconomics.org.uk/gen/z_sys_publicationdetail.aspx?pid=258\">Green New Deal</a> that will create an ecologically sustainable, pro-society economy capable of generating wealth, jobs and equitable development.

  "<p>Gordon Brown was today criticised for not doing enough to help people pay their soaring fuel bills after he unveiled a \u00a31bn <a href=\" http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page16807\">home energy saving programme</a> and pledged to increase cold weather payments from \u00a38.50 to \u00a325 a week.</p> <p>Consumer groups and pressure groups said that while the measures were welcome, providing free and subsidised insulation in the long term would not help the millions of householders who face problems in the coming months.</p> <p>Some unions and Labour MPs reacted angrily, renewing their demands for a windfall tax on the energy companies.</p> <p>At a news conference in Downing Street, Brown said that under his plan all low income and pensioner households would get free loft and cavity insulation, while everybody else would be entitled to half-price energy-saving measures.</p> <p>He said there would be \"immediate help for those who need it most\" but stressed that the moves were focused on reducing energy consumption.</p> <p>\"Our objective is nothing less than a sea-change in energy efficiency and consumption, at the same time as helping the most vulnerable households this winter,\" he said.</p> <p>Brown said the government would be legislating to ensure that energy suppliers and electricity producers would provide \u00a3910m in funding for the measures.</p> <p>The premier said provision had been made to give 6m homes insulation and provide help for 5m more between now and 2011.</p> <p>There would also be action to ensure that households on pre-payment meters do not face higher tariffs.</p> <p>He said 600,000 low-income households will also have lower social tariffs by the end of the year.</p> <p>In the event of \"severe\" weather this winter, cold weather payments will increase from \u00a38.50 to \u00a325 a week.</p> <p>Ministers were also meeting banks to increase the take-up of direct debits to pay energy bills and make savings of between \u00a3100 to \u00a3150 a year.</p> <p>A national information campaign will be launched tomorrow to publicise the support on offer.</p> <p>Brown said the government had considered introducing a windfall tax but had decided that this package was \"the better way of moving forward\".</p> <p>And he said he did not expect the \u00a3910m cost to be passed from the energy companies to customers.</p> <p>The environment secretary, Hilary Benn, said there would be a \u00a374m increase in funding for the warm front scheme, as well as a \"community energy saving programme\" with officials visiting poor households across the country to help them identify ways to save energy.</p> <p>He said the number of people who would be helped by the overall package would depend on the number of people who came forward for assistance.</p> <p>Gordon Lishman, director general of Age Concern, said: \"This package will leave millions of the poorest pensioners wondering how they will afford their bills this winter.</p> <p>\"Energy efficiency measures are important to tackling fuel poverty in the long-term, and increased cold weather payments are welcome.</p> <p>\"However, wider pricing reforms are desperately needed to reduce fuel poverty levels and the millions of pensioners struggling to meet their bills will be disappointed that no further emergency help has been announced for this winter.\"</p> <p>Frank Field, the Labour former welfare minister, said: \"The government has spent all summer roaring about the package it will produce and now out pops a proposal that will probably do very little for many of the poorest pensioners meeting this year's winter fuel bills.\"</p> <p>Tony Woodley, joint leader of Unite, who has been pressing for a windfall tax on energy firms, said: \"The measures unveiled today are inching in the direction of social justice but they need to take far bigger steps to avert fuel poverty hitting thousands of needy people this winter.</p> <p>\"Greedy energy companies are putting the squeeze on ordinary people with even the energy bosses coming clean and admitting that rocketing customer prices mean massive profits for the companies. This abuse must end.</p> <p>\"Only a windfall tax can provide the urgent help necessary, that is money to help make ends meet. That money must come from those responsible for the criminal charges in the first place, the greedy energy giants.</p> <p>\"Unite will fight on for fuel justice. We'll be taking the case to the Labour party conference, turning up the volume until government puts the public interest over the vested interests of big business.\"</p> <p>Ministers said households would be able to save more than \u00a3300 on their energy bills if they took advantage of the assistance on offer.</p> <p>About \u00a3560m of the \u00a3910m to be raised from energy companies will be used to subsidise loft and cavity wall insulation, helping up to 2m households.</p> <p>The other \u00a3350m would fund a new programme of house-to-house calls offering help in deprived areas.</p> <p>The \u00a3910m is on top of companies' obligation to spend \u00a32.8bn over the next three years helping customers cut down on consumption.</p> <p>Benn said that, in total, homes were in line for \u00a36.5bn of energy-saving improvements.</p> <p>The government wants every home - \"where practical\" - insulated by 2020.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrat leader, Nick Clegg, said: \"These measures will not do nearly enough to help the millions of people who will struggle to heat their homes this winter.</p> <p>\"While these measures are baby steps in the right direction, the government should have compelled the energy companies to go much further.</p> <p>\"The energy giants have profited to the tune of more than \u00a39bn from the EU emissions trading scheme.</p> <p>\"They should be forced to use most of this money to properly insulate the homes of their most vulnerable customers and introduce social tariffs to cut energy bills.\"</p> <p>The shadow business secretary, Alan Duncan, said: \"We're fully behind any help that we can give to families with energy efficiency and reducing their household bills.</p> <p>\"We have been calling on the government to use energy efficiency measures to fight fuel poverty for well over two years.</p> <p>\"But we're now in the middle of September and it's not clear how this announcement will help the millions of people who will struggle to heat their homes this winter.</p> <p>\"Despite all their grand promises of cash payouts, all Gordon Brown has been able to offer is to restore a budget which they cut last winter and a package of measures that should have been implemented years ago.</p> <p>\"Gordon Brown's much-promised energy package turns out only to be undoing mistakes he himself made earlier in the year.\"</p>",
  "<p>The clear and sunny blue skies of September 11 2001 are on the verge of joining \"It was a dark and stormy night\" as a clich\u00e9. But it was true, and most mornings of the 10 days since I had moved into downtown Manhattan by South Street Seaport, I rode my bicycle briskly round through Battery Park and up the newly-opened cycle path along the West Side Highway. I would normally have been speeding past the World Trade Centre about the time the first plane hit.</p> <p>That morning, however, I was on deadline to write about the impending downfall of the US dollar. I had just typed a prophetic \"The\" when I heard the bang. I looked out my window, assuming one of the decrepit old buildings in the neighbourhood had just lost its battle with gravity, but the porters in the fish market in the square below were <a href=\"http://hereisnewyork.org/\">staring</a> up open-mouthed, looking like gawkers at the alien ship in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075860/\">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a>. They were staring at the exit wound in the tower, billowing black smoke.</p> <p>The phone started ringing, and I was stuck on my fire escape talking to radio stations, since all mobile phones were out. On the streets crowds of refugees - covered in soot, dishevelled - filed along South St toward the Brooklyn Bridge, where their silhouettes made it look like an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._S._Lowry\">LS Lowry</a> set design for a Potemkin film.</p> <p>Once the crowds had gone and the phones had stopped ringing, I headed toward the Twin Towers with recorder and notebook in hand. The police manned roadblocks around the site, but I suspected, correctly, that they would not have closed the footpath along Hudson. Trudging through the ashes around the site drifting like fallout brought the revelation that some proportion of that ash was people, leading to even deeper appreciation of the Downtown Hospital staff who had been handing out face masks. Retrospectively, the discovery that there was much more asbestos than human ash made using them seem even better.</p> <p>Round by South Cove, the firefighters had levered open a convenience store as a supply depot near where their trails of hoses drew water from the Hudson. They were going in for bottles of water and snacks before returning to the site. The road was a surrealist vision of hell. Trucks and cars scattered like a kid's toys, and over all, like thick snow, the drifting ash.</p> <p>I was interviewing the dazed and exhausted firemen, letting them use my cell phone to call and reassure their families since it was getting a signal from across in New Jersey when one came out, a bottle of water in one hand and a banana in the other. As he wolfed it down, he looked around, puzzled. \"I was looking for a garbage can,\" he explained as he surveyed the ruins and - in a gesture epitomising the new rules - hurled his banana skin into the piled-up fall out.</p> <p>As soon as our lease was up, a year later, we left. The memories, of the processions of refugees, the military convoys that arrived overnight down the FDR Drive, the ashes and the pervasive stench of the gates of hell as the Towers <a href=\"http://www.phaidon.com/aftermath/\">burnt for months afterwards</a>, all lingered.</p> <p>Today, downtown Manhattan seems to be booming. The fish market has closed, taking away much of the local colour \u2013 and a pervasive cloacal smell and all-night racket. People have moved in, and brought life to an area that used to close down at five \u2013 except for the fish.</p> <p>It also brings a smile that the foreshore in front of the old hotel/brothel that our apartment was in was reclaimed with the blitzed rubble of my hometown Liverpool, brought over as ballast on the Atlantic convoys. But there's little else to smile about. When I wondered through Wall Street recently, I could still see the crowds fleeing, smell the acrid smoke of the world's longest-lasting funeral pyre, and when I looked at George Washington's statue outside <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/feha/\">Federal Hall</a>, I could still see him, in my mind's eye, with a layer of white ash on his wig.</p> <p>They have only <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122100941916217671.html?mod=googlenews_wsj\">just begun filling the hole</a> where the Towers were \u2013 and they still have not found Osama bin Laden. I don't have to go into a fugue to see that seven years later, the world is pretty much debris-strewn since the current George W in the White House threw out the constitution, international law and pretty much everything else \u2013 and it's clear that their social instincts never really minded littering on a global scale anyway.</p>",

  "<p>The prime minister, Gordon Brown, today accepted responsibility for Labour's continuing poor performance in the opinion polls.</p> <p>But he also laid some of the blame on the global economy.</p> <p>\"I am explaining to you that if you go around the world, you will see that every country is affected,\" he said.</p> <p>The reason such comments provoke scepticism is because Brown's mantra during his 10 years at the Treasury was that his prudence as chancellor of the exchequer would ensure there would never be a return to \"boom and bust\" economics.</p> <p>Year after year, the message was the same:</p> <p><strong>May 20, 1997, speech by the chancellor to the CBI: Exploiting the British genius \u2013 the key to long-term economic success: </strong><br> \"Stability is necessary for our future economic success. The British economy of the future must be built not on the shifting sands of boom and bust, but on the bedrock of prudent and wise economic management for the long term. It is only these firm foundations that we can raise Britain's underlying economic performance.\"</p> <p><strong>April 28 1998, speech by the chancellor to the British American business council in London:</strong><br>\"Now it is true to say in Britain that the last forty years has been characterised by stop go, boom bust, instability in economic policy. And so I can tell you that the first objective of the new government has been the determination to ensure monetary and fiscal stability, in place of stop go, and to do so in an economy far more open than the sheltered national economics of the past.\"</p> <p><strong>June 10 1999, speech by the chancellor at Mansion House:</strong> <br>\"The way forward is for governments to consciously pursue monetary and fiscal stability through setting clear objectives, establishing proper rules, and requiring openness and transparency - the new rules of the game. Particularly important for a Britain which has been more subject than most economies to the instability of boom-bust cycles and constantly changing policies.</p> <p>Indeed, the economy of 1997 was set to repeat the same cycle of boom and bust that had been seen over the past 20 years. There were strong inflationary pressures in the system. Consumer spending was growing at an unsustainable rate and inflation was set to rise sharply above target; there was a large structural deficit on the public finances. Public sector net borrowing stood at \u00a328 billion.</p> <p>So we put in place a wholly new long term framework of monetary and fiscal policy based on:</p> <p>* first, clear objectives: price stability through a pre-announced inflation target - a symmetrical target - and sustainable public finances through tough fiscal rules: the golden rule that requires that over the cycle we balance the current budget, and the sustainable investment rule requires that, as we borrow for investment, debt is held to a prudent and stable level;</p> <p>* second, well understood rules: a new system of monetary policy-making, at the heart of which is the independence of the Bank of England, and its open letter system, and an equivalent and equally important set of fiscal procedures legally enshrined in the code for fiscal stability; and</p> <p>* third, transparency in policy-making: an open system of decision-making in monetary policy through the publication of minutes, a system of voting and full reporting to parliament; and in fiscal policy the same openness and disclosure with key fiscal assumptions independently audited.\"</p> <p><strong>April 5 2000, Speech by Gordon Brown to the British Chamber of Commerce national conference:</strong><br>\"In a global marketplace with its increased insecurities and indeed often volatility and instability national economic stability is at a premium, the precondition for all we can achieve, and no nation can secure the high levels of sustainable investment it needs without both monetary and fiscal stability together.</p> <p>And it was to avoid the historic British problem - the violence of the repeated boom and bust cycles of the past - that we established the new monetary framework based on consistent rules - the symmetrical inflation target; settled well understood procedures - Bank independence; and openness and transparency. And side by side with it and as important, a new fiscal discipline with, again, clear and consistent rules - the golden rule for public spending; well understood procedures - our fiscal responsibility legislation; and a new openness and transparency\u2026</p> <p>My vision is of a Britain where there is not stop go and boom bust but economic stability; a Britain which is business-friendly, and where there is enterprise, opportunity for all; a Britain which rewards the innovator and risk-taker and encourages a new generation of entrepreneurs, a Britain which because opportunity is open to all is enterprising and fair.\"</p> <p><strong>June 20 2001, chancellor's speech at Mansion House</strong><br>\"Every time in recent decades when the British economy has started to grow, Governments of both parties have taken short-term decisions which too often have created unsustainable consumer booms, let the economy get out of control and sacrificed monetary and fiscal prudence. And everyone here will remember how quickly and easily boom turned to bust in the early nineties.</p> <p>So Britain did need a wholly new monetary and fiscal framework that went beyond the crude Keynesian fine tuning of the fifties and sixties and the crude monetarism of the seventies and eighties and, instead, offered a modern British route to stability.\"</p> <p><strong>March 28 2002, speech to the TGWU conference, Manufacturing matters</strong><br>\"With Bank of England independence, tough decisions on inflation, new fiscal rules, and hard public spending controls, we today in our country have economic stability not boom and bust, the lowest inflation in Europe, and long term interest rates - essential for businesses planning to borrow and invest - lower than for thirty five years.</p> <p>So while many have claimed Britain was worst placed of any to withstand the global slowdown, the OECD and IMF have both shown that Britain last year had the highest growth of any of the G7 countries.</p> <p>So nothing we do will put at risk the fundamental stability on which manufacturing depends.</p> <p>There will be no return to the short-term lurches in policy that would put long-term stability at risk.</p> <p>No relaxing our fiscal disciplines as some would like.\"</p> <p><strong>November 18, 2003, speech to the CBI national conference</strong><br>\"But, for the first time in fifty years, Britain has not only avoided recession but has continued to grow in quarter after quarter, year after year, in all six years of our government since 1997.</p> <p>Remember the old days, what was called the British problem: stop go, boom bust, unstable cycles\u2026Britain the country usually first in, worst hit and last out of any world downturn; invariably hit by an inflation problem that prevented interest rates falling when they needed to come down; and usually then by wage inflation that could not be afforded and prevented you making long term investment.</p> <p>So I want to explain to you today the policy we - and the Bank of England - will continue to pursue to ensure the British economy entrenches our new won and hard won stability and continues to grow \u2013 ensuring we take no risks with inflation or stability generally, or with the fiscal position.\"</p> <p><strong>April 21 2004, remarks at the British Chambers of Commerce annual conference:</strong><br>\"Now, by working together, we can see a Britain that has a new found and hard won stability with: the lowest inflation for thirty years; and the lowest interest rates for forty years; the lowest unemployment for a generation; and a Britain that is seen today as the most stable of all the major economies.</p> <p>And it is important we understand how and why it is Britain \u2013 once the most stop go of economies - which has avoided the recessions that hit America, Germany, Japan, Italy and most other industrial economies during the world downturn of the last few years and has enjoyed sustained and sustainable growth.</p> <p>So let me just explain the long term difficult decisions that had to be made and what I know we must also do to entrench that stability for the future.\"</p> <p><strong>September 13 2005, speech the Trades Union Congress annual conference</strong><br>\"And I also tell you straight \u2013 in the face of that global challenge from which there is no hiding place, no safe haven other than equipping ourselves better for our future \u2013 if we are to succeed there must be no return to the fiscal irresponsibility, the economic short termism, the inflationary pay deals and the old conflicts and disorder of the past; there can be no retreat from demanding efficiency and value for money as well as equity as we renew and reform public services; there is no future for a global trading nation like ours in trying to erect protectionist barriers with the rest of the world. And just as we need stability in inflation and interest rates, we need stability in our industry policy, stability in industrial relations, and stability in our trading relationships with the rest of the world, and we build this stability for a purpose: for it is the one sure route to full employment for our generation and to prosperity for all.</p> <p>And at every time we must act to tackle the risks to stability and growth, risks that are today already reducing European growth rates to one per cent and raising European unemployment beyond twenty million, risks that now have risen from the doubling of world oil prices.\"</p> <p><strong>June 5 2006, speech the CBI president's dinner:</strong><br>\"Now, over the past few months I have been all over Britain and have seen British business succeeding in the global economy:</p> <p>* a few days ago I welcomed the new Airbus A380 with its Rolls Royce engines to Heathrow Airport - the largest commercial airliner ever built - and a symbol of Britain and Europe's modern manufacturing strength, and capacity to compete and win in the high tech industries of the future;</p> <p> * from Glasgow and Edinburgh, to Cardiff and Bristol, to Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle, Leeds, I have visited city after city and seen each city thriving, growing, prospering - each one a demonstration of the vibrancy and dynamism of Britain's creative industries; <br>  * and all over the country I have met young men and women with ideas for their own businesses, showing the entrepreneurial flair that I believe has led one distinguished body to speak of a step change in Britain's enterprise culture and is a sign of Britain's enterprise success.</p> <p>These \u2013 and your success \u2013 convince me that despite all the challenges we face and how much more we know we have to do and continue to do to maintain our competitiveness, more than ever that Britain is well placed to be one of the great global success stories of this century.\"</p> <p><strong>May 5 2007, speech at the CBI annual dinner</strong><br>\"Exactly 10 years ago when I first spoke to you as Chancellor, the country had spent a whole era wrestling with inflation and volatility and quite frankly the havoc stop go visited on long term investment.</p> <p>Thinking back to my words to you then, I set out my pledge to make stability the central pillar of my economic and business policy.</p> <p>I was convinced that having the strength to take the long term decisions to ensure Britain's competitiveness meant developing a shared national purpose that economic stability came first.</p> <p>Now tonight I am here speaking to you ten years on to say that we need to forge that same shared national purpose for the years ahead, this time to meet and master the new and even more profound challenges ahead - mastering the pace of change and the relentless competition we face from every part of the world in every area of our economy, now affecting every area of your business.</p> <p>And building on our hard won stability, our mission now and for the years ahead is to make Britain the dynamic and competitive enterprise economy we all want it to be.\"</p>",
  "<h2>THE QUESTION</h2> <p><strong>What makes a restaurant sustainable?</strong></p> <p>Just ask the <a href=\"http://www.theclerkenwellkitchen.co.uk\">Clerkenwell Kitchen</a>, the first ever winner of Time Out's Best Sustainable Restaurant award. CK, which also happens to be the Guardian's unofficial canteen, came out on top despite tough competition from the <strong>Duke of Cambridge</strong>, the Soil Association-certified gastropub; <strong>Saf</strong>, the raw vegan restaurant; <strong>Tom's Place</strong>, Aiken's recently closed sustainable chippy; and <strong>Water House</strong>, the energy-saving eco-restaurant.</p> <p>CK sources locally, seasonally and, where possible, organically. Items such as coffee are Fairtrade, fish is from plentiful stocks, and the menu is not too meat-heavy (important in light of recent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/07/food.foodanddrink\">UN advice</a>). The food is freshly cooked every day, waste is recycled, and tap water is offered. <a href=\"http://www.londonfoodlink.org\">London Food Link</a> confirmed that their eco-efforts were top-notch, and Time Out reviewers gave a thumbs up to the food and service.</p> <p>The introduction of a sustainable category to <a href=\"http://www.timeout.com/london/restaurants/features/5634/Time_Out_Eating_Drinking_Awards_2008.html\">Time Out's eating and drinking awards</a> reflects the increasing importance of environmental issues to diners and restaurateurs. According to <a href=\"http://www.zagat.com/buzz/EntryList.aspx?SCID=36&amp;hid=zbuzz_london_ns\">Zagat</a>, who this week published its own guide, it is \"an overwhelming trend \u2026 people are telling us that they want their food to be organic, locally sourced and sustainable.\"</p> <p>Nibbles welcomes these developments, but looks forward to the day when the award becomes obsolete. After all, if all restaurants put sustainability at the top of their agenda, an extra 'ethical' category wouldn't be needed.</p> <h2>IN SEASON</h2> <p><strong>Venison</strong></p> <p>This gently gamey meat is low in fat but high in flavour, so it's worth choosing over beef whenever you get the chance. It doesn't have to be cooked slowly in a casserole, although it is delicious that way - just make sure you add decent amount of fat (eg streaky bacon) to stop it drying out.

We've long been a fan of their chocolate-covered pumpkin seeds, soya beans and raisins (they're healthy, right?). Now they've launched a great giftbox, containing six scrumptious bars in daring but delicious flavours, including mandarin &amp; ginger, lavender, and rose. The chocolate contains 72% cocoa solids plus essential oils, and is organic and Fairtrade. The box would be great as a gift - but it's even better to sit and scoff yourself.

So this weekend we'll be staying under the duvet for as long as possible, then warming our cockles with a decent <strong>bloody mary</strong>. Indulgent, yes, but it spices up a dreary day.

  "<p>When George Bush announced the <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/09/20080909.html\">withdrawal of 8,000 combat troops from Iraq</a> this week, he devoted a considerable amount of his speech to Afghanistan and Pakistan, where Asif Ali Zardari has just succeeded a disgraced Pervez Musharraf as president.</p> <p>Specifically, Bush said the US had to help Pakistan defeat Taliban and al-Qaida fighters hiding in its remote border regions with Afghanistan, where, the US president reminded us, the global war on terror started with the attacks on the World Trade Centre.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Defeating these terrorist and extremists is also Pakistan's responsibility - because every nation has an obligation to govern its own territory and make certain that it does not become a safe haven for terror. America and our Nato allies will continue helping Pakistan in its efforts to defeat the extremists.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Bush's remarks take on added significance in light of an article in <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/11/washington/11policy.html?hp\">today's New York Times</a>, which reports that he secretly approved orders in July allowing US special forces to make ground assaults inside Pakistan without the prior approval of the Pakistani government.</p> <p>For some time now, the US has carried out <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/09/04/asia/04attack.php\">missile and artillery strikes inside Pakistan targeting al-Qaida members</a>. They have also killed civilians, arousing understandable resentment in Pakistan.</p> <p>But last week, US ground troops carried out their first foray into Pakistan in pursuit of al-Qaida fighters, so today's piece in the New York Times should not come as too much of a surprise.</p> <p>Increased US military activity in Pakistan has been on the cards for some time. American policy makers have made no secret of their impatience at what they see as the lack of Pakistani resolve in pursuing a reinvigorated al-Qaida and Taliban implanting themselves in the tribal areas where central authority has been weak to non-existent for ages.</p> <p>But increased US intervention brings its own dangers, not least if it turns the Pakistani public \u2013 which is increasingly anti-American \u2013 against Zardari, who has vowed to fight terrorism. Should Pakistanis see Zardari as a US stooge, it will make his attempt to restore economic stability and fight the growing extremist threat that much more difficult.</p> <p>The big danger is that if the US does not proceed with tact and care, the <a href=\"http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/JI10Df02.html\">US and Pakistan will be working at loggerheads</a> instead of together against a common threat.</p> <p>It does not bode well for the US-Pakistan alliance when General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, the head of Pakistan's army, who usually keeps a low profile, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/sep/11/pakistan.usa\">went public with a warning against unilateral attacks</a>.</p> <p>\"Falling for short-term gains while ignoring our long-term interest is not the right way forward,\" Kayani said, in what can only be seen as a very direct message to Bush and whoever succeeds him in November.</p> <p>A more overt US military role poses dangers for the next occupant of the White House as well, with a war-weary public. As the <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/India/Covert_bid_to_push_US_troops_into_Pak/articleshow/2729511.cms\">Times of India</a>, which has been watching America's growing willingness to involve itself militarily in Pakistan, notes:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Most interventions in Third World countries begin with such ventures involving advisers and trainers, as it happened with the Soviet involvement in Afghanistan and Cuba. Although widely regarded as a vassal state, Pakistan had avoided direct involvement of US troops inside its territory to avoid a public backlash from an increasingly anti-American mood in the country.\"</p> </blockquote>",

  "<p>As we observe the seventh anniversary of the attacks of 9/11, we again hear politicians hurl the familiar \"soft-on-terror\" charge of having a <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/articles/news/campaign-2008/2008/06/18/mccain-obama-trade-jabs-on-terrorism-and-national-security.html\">\"September 10 mindset\"</a>. In truth, no American who experienced the horror of September 11, 2001 will ever again know the luxury of a September 10 mindset. The greater concern is being stuck in a September 12 mindset, unable or unwilling to understand the lessons we've learned since those terrible early days. This is the mindset that undermines America's long-term security.</p> <p>On September 12, 2001, we lived with a deep sense of fragility as we waited in fear for the next attack. Over the subsequent days and years, however, Americans returned to their daily lives, just as the people of London went back down into the subways after <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2005/london.bombing/\">their own attacks</a>. We learned that resiliency is an essential and powerful weapon against terrorism. It means knowing that there may be another attack, but refusing to live in, or make decisions based upon, fear. When politicians and policymakers fall back on that September 12 mindset of fear to convey their message and promote their policies, they undermine that essential public resiliency. </p> <p>In those early days following 9/11, President Bush spoke of our response as a \"crusade\". He tried later to remove the religious connotation but subsequently developed the \"global war on terrorism\". We now know that both of these terms empower Osama bin Laden, uniting disparate terrorist groups into a global cause and dividing the US from its allies who believe the costs of approaching this long-term challenge as a global war outweigh any benefits from the use of the term. </p> <p>Yet, some in Washington still use the language of a holy war, ignoring the advice of counterterrorism experts at CIA and the department of homeland security to <a href=\"http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/archives/us_kills_jihadists_with_stroke_of_pen_creating_violent_extremists_as_byproduct/\">stop calling terrorists \"jihadists\"</a>. Giving terrorists their long-desired but unmerited status as global \"holy warriors\" reflects a failure to heed the lessons learned in the years since September 12, 2001 \u2013 and it strengthens our enemy.</p> <p>On September 12, we thought we could defeat terrorism by going to war. Today, most of us understand that we are engaged in a battle for hearts and minds, competing against the terrorists' narrative of a glorious \"global jihad\" that attracts idealistic young people looking for answers. The image of America ensuring that even suspected terrorists get their day in court is a powerful antidote to the twisted allure of terrorism. Continuing to work toward the ideal of the shining city on the hill, contrary to the fears of some, is how this country will ultimately prevail against the terrorists.</p> <p>We also sought, in those first days and months after 9/11, to \"balance\" national security and civil liberties, as if they were competing objectives on opposite sides of the scale. We thought we could only get more of one by taking away from the other. Over the past seven years, however, we've been reminded that our values make us strong. For example, the reason the US does not face the level of home-grown terrorism threat Europe has experienced is that immigrants are <a href=\"http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=10&amp;categ_id=5&amp;article_id=95775\">better integrated</a> into American society. Effectively working with Muslim communities in this country is one of the most promising avenues for deterring radicalisation of young people. Policies that drive a wedge between those communities and the government frustrate those efforts and thereby threaten our national security. </p> <p>On September 12, it seemed that our careful system of checks and balances was a luxury we could no longer afford. We've seen since that an avaricious arrogation of power by the executive leads to a dangerously weakened president. Our government is strongest when all three branches are fulfilling their constitutional roles. Still, there are those who would seek to limit the role of the courts and seem unwilling to call upon the president to follow the laws passed by Congress.</p> <p>We all awoke to a changed world on September 12. But the world has continued to change, and so must our understanding of the threat we now face and how to combat it. The battle for hearts and minds is of tremendous consequence. The enemy is deadly, determined and adaptive. We cannot defeat it if we are stuck in the past. Americans deserve leaders who have moved beyond the politics of fear and who understand what makes us strong, leaders who are not stuck in a September 12 frame of mind.</p>",
  "<p>Which member of the London Assembly finds Boris Johnson most infuriating? On the evidence of the four Mayor's Question Times so far, I'd say it was the Green Party's Jenny Jones. Her interrogations of him in the chamber have reminded me of a kind yet demanding primary school teacher having her patience sorely tested by a gifted but exasperating pupil. Yesterday, in the City Hall cafe, she gave me an insight into a less public exchange between the two. The way she told it, it went a bit like this:</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>The Blond</strong>: \"Would you consider becoming my informal adviser on environmental issues?\"</p> <p><strong>The Green</strong>: \"What, so you can not pay me for the job and ignore everything I tell you too?\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The context for this rebuffed offer was the extremely long time it took Mayor Johnson to fill the environment post. At one MQT Jones had put it to him that this was simply because he didn't know anyone who'd be up to the task. Johnson's subsequent <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2008/sep/02/boris.london\">appointment</a> of Isabel Dedring seemed to confirm this suspicion: Dedring is to be seconded from her present job as Transport for London's policy director, suggesting that a dearth of suitable Tory types had obliged Johnson to look within the <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/london_group.jsp\">GLA \"family\"</a>. </p> <p>The fact that Dedring wrote Ken Livingstone's <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/environment/climate-change/ccap/index.jsp\">Climate Change Action Plan</a> has amused Ken admirers and deepened Ken-haters' <a href=\"http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-mayor/article-23552260-details/It's+time+to+turn+your+attention+to+TfL%2C+Boris/article.do\">umbrage</a> at Johnson's apparently becoming rather chummy with the TfL hierarchy, which both <a href=\"http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23458906-details/Mayor's+bus+boss+and+'nail+Boris'+emails/article.do\">they</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/mar/07/london08.boris\">he</a> accused during the election of being propagandists on Livingstone's behalf. The Greens, though are pleased: collaborators with Livingstone during his second term, they rate Dedring highly. That said, Jones noted at yesterday's MQTs that she is not to be given the title of Deputy Mayor, suggesting a low position in the adviser hierarchy reflected a low priority for green policies. </p> <p>Johnson demurred. And perhaps environmentalists should take heart from Dedring's salary arrangements. Her pay from TfL is higher than that of the most generously rewarded of Johnson's <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/team/\">lieutenants</a> and she won't be taking a cut. If remuneration talks, Dedring's voice will be the loudest in Team Boris.</p>",

  "<p><br>In the mix ... Samak Sundaravej (left, photo: Andy Rain/EPA) and Chow Yun-Fat</p> <p>Meet Samak Sundaravej. He's cooking up a storm. He's out of the frying pan, into the fire, and whatever other culinary cliche you care to reheat and pass off as fresh. One minute he's just another deeply unpopular world leader, up to his neck in corruption and clinging to office by his fingernails. The next, disaster! He's pitched into the slop-bucket and fed to the pigs. And all on account of that dratted cookery show.</p> <p>So yes, this week's Casting the News concerns <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/10/thailand\">Samak, the prime minister of Thailand</a> who has just been ruled to have breached the conflict of interest law after moonlighting as a celebrity chef and must therefore be drummed out of office. Hear the rumbling outrage of the People Power Party. Sniff the sweet delight of the People's Alliance for Democracy. Taste the full-bodied schadenfreude of the United People's Party for Peopledom. OK, we made that last one up \u2013 but feel free to go the Life of Brian route with this one.</p> <p>Certainly there's a lot to chew over here. Samak was the host of a cookery show called <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMfRHMqBDQ8\">Tasting, Grumbling</a>, in which he would prowl the wet markets of Bangkok, remonstrating with stall-holders, pausing only to whip up his trademark dish of \"pork leg in Coca-Cola\" (no Tesco own brand for Samak). His critics allege that he was actually never more than a puppet stooge of one <a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hZnteOhgq1LvlCAZWxAjH68KQhcw\">Thaksin Shinawatra</a>, the former PM who was ousted in a military coup in 2006 and now purportedly pulls the strings from exile in the UK. </p> <p>It strikes me that Samak's saga could be played as a classic love triangle, with our hero caught between two masters and acting like a fool. Who's his real boss? The deposed Thaksin or the rapacious executives at Coca-Cola Global, insisting that he takes time off from a crucial summit to televise another pork stewing session? I think the film needs a goofy, quirky approach. Someone like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F86s4Vq59Ks\">David O Russell could make a good fist</a> of it.</p> <p>As to the casting, we note that Samak is actually of Chinese descent. Chow Yun-Fat might be a good candidate for the role. Alternatively, you could take a crass, Hollywood approach and dragoon in - ooh, let's go crazy here \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/aug/13/comedy.benstiller\">Ben Stiller</a> as Samak, Vince Vaughn as Thaksin and Owen Wilson as Mr Coca-Cola. </p> <p>Here's what we need \u2026</p> <p>Samak Sundaravej:</p> <p>Thaksin Shinawatra:</p> <p>The Coca-Cola Executive:</p> <p>Director:</p> <p>Title:</p> <p>Tagline:</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2008/sep/04/castingthenews2\">Sarah Palin story</a>, meanwhile, shows no signs of reaching the closing credits, what with all that kerfuffle over Obama's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/cartoon/2008/sep/11/sara.palin.us.elections\">lipstick-on-a-pig</a> line. There was huge support for Mary McDonnell in the title role, so I guess we'll run with that - although I'm secretly voting for Greatpoochini's choice of Sandra Bullock. GreenMachine suggests Bruce Willis to play McCain and Karl Rove as director. Finally, dfic1999's tagline (\"Underneath the hockey mask, evil lurks\") guarantees shudders all the way to November \u2013 and possibly beyond.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown today accepted responsibility for Labour's continuing poor performance in the opinion polls insisting: \"I'm the person who's in charge.\"</p> <p>But the prime minister said that the poor performance of the global economy was also partly to blame and it was his job to \"take people through these difficult times\".</p> <p>Asked during his monthly press conference whether he took personal responsibility for Labour's troubles, Brown replied: \"Of course. I'm the person who is in charge and I have got to take responsibility for what happens.</p> <p>\"But I am explaining to you that if you go around the world, you will see that every country is affected.</p> <p>\"In fact when we saw the European economic numbers come out a few days ago we saw that Germany had gone down 0.3%, Italy had gone down, France had gone down, Spain had gone down, Ireland has gone down while we were not in that position at that point.</p> <p>\"So every country is facing these difficult circumstances but we have got a duty to take people through these difficult times and to show people that the policies we are pursuing, both to get the economy moving and to keep people in jobs - we are benefiting from the fact that we have got low unemployment, we have got low interest rates and we have got low national debt which enables us to borrow in a period of difficulty to take people through these times.\"</p>",
  "<p>Two hundred years ago coal was the lifeblood of a revolution that transformed the world, lifting people from poverty by powering new technology with energy captured from the sun, stored for hundreds of millions of years in fossilised plant remains and then released in combustion.<br> In recent years, we have become aware of a downside, however: the rapid accumulation of higher and higher levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide. This is in large part being caused by coal burning, is changing the climate and causing massive economic costs. It is quite amazing, therefore, that a British government, which claims a leading role in the fight against climate change, is backing the construction of new coal-fired power stations. The <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/independent_reviews/stern_review_economics_climate_change/sternreview_index.cfm\">Stern Review</a> on climate change, commissioned by Gordon Brown, couldn't have been clearer in its conclusion that we need to take action now to avoid massive climate change-driven economic damages later on, which will fall on our children and cause disproportionate impacts on the world's poorest people. In relation to climate change, it seems therefore that social justice is for policy makers an immediate and local concept \u2013 people in the future and far away simply don't count.<br> If they did, then new coal plants would not be on the agenda. By accepting proposals for new coal-fired power stations, the UK government not only sends a signal to industry here that it is not serious about action to cut emissions, but has also undermined its own credibility in persuading other countries to embrace a new international climate change regime. Under these circumstances it is all the more significant that a jury considering charges of criminal damage at Maidstone crown court <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/11/activists.kingsnorthclimatecamp\">acquitted six Greenpeace activists</a> on Wednesday after they sought to shut down Kingsnorth power station in Kent: a coal-fired power station that could soon be the site of a new coal plant, if proposals from energy firm E.ON UK are backed by ministers.<br> The Greenpeace campaigners <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/poll/2008/sep/11/climatechange.kingsnorthclimatecamp\">claimed</a> their action had a lawful basis, because their intention was to help avoid the costs and damages that would arise from future climate changes. That seems to me utterly consistent with the policy implications of the Stern Review, and I hope that Gordon Brown will signal his support for the protesters, while at the same time telling the cocky executives at E.ON UK that the days when companies could make applications to build unabated coal stations are finished, and that they need to get out of that technology and into cleaner power sources, especially renewables.<br> The simple realty we face is that we cannot keep climate changes at levels we can cope with, while at the same time continuing to use conventional coal technologies to meet our power needs. While policy makers and the planning process still seem unable to grasp this inconvenient truth, the jury in Maidstone, in considering the facts of the matter, could reach no other conclusion. </p> <p>We are approaching the brink of climate changes that could wreck our civilisations, create humanitarian disasters on a scale never before seen, provoke a mass extinction and, according to Lord Stern, cause costs with a bigger economic impact than both world wars and the great depression combined. The jury leaned that coal is the biggest threat and handed down the only verdict they reasonably could. <br> I don't think it is Greenpeace that should have been on trial, but Labour energy policy and the blind profit-driven business strategies of companies like E.ON UK.</p>",

Where do you stand on the debate? Photograph: Ben Curtis/Press Association</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I am just starting work on a large piece examining the arguments around genetically modified foods, and I want your help. GM raises many questions. Are they the solution to the world's food shortages, as some suggest, or are they of no help whatsoever? Are they, as some have argued, a genuine threat to the well being of both us and our environment?<br> Normally what happens with a subject like this is that the journalist works away quietly, interviewing people and consulting sources. The piece is written, posted to the web and then the debate begins, sometimes rancorously. Despite \u2013 or perhaps because - they are being introduced to both arguments and sources of information that they missed the journalist, understandably, becomes defensive. The posters become increasingly adamant. We thought we'd try a different approach for this one. We'd like those of you with something to say about GM foods to tell us what you think now, at the beginning of the reporting process, so that your take on the subject can become a part of the finished article.  We do of course want your opinions \u2013 we do all have gut responses to important subjects like this \u2013 but what we really want is for you to point us in the direction of reports, documents and studies available on the web which could well inform my reporting and which otherwise we might have missed. (Though be assured: the Observer has produced an impressive pile of material for me. A lot of happy bed time reading there.) It goes without saying that I would like to be supplied with evidence from both sides of the debate. Anybody who has something they'd rather not share with the group can email me at <a href=\"mailto:jay.rayner@observer.co.uk\">jay.rayner@observer.co.uk</a>.<br> Obviously it would be quite possible to work out what my starting position on GM Foods is, both from what I have previously written, and things I've said on the radio. But I'm not going to restate it here, because it can interfere with obtaining interviews if people think they already know which side of the debate you're on, and because the temptation to tack your posts to my position will be almost irresistible. In any case, it's irrelevant. I am out to have those opinions informed and, perhaps, in the process, have them changed. We'll leave this one open for three days, otherwise it could run and run. And when the article is published in a few weeks time it too will be here to be read and commented upon.</p>",
  "<p>There was some speculation in the blogosphere the other day to the effect that Gordon Brown was <a href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/westminster/2008/09/is-brown-running-from-the-press/\">\"running from the press\"</a> and that one planned news conference had already been cancelled. </p> <p>Well, Downing Street has responded. Brown will be appearing at 10am. </p> <p>Obviously he will be using his news conference to promote the much-trailed fuel poverty package. But the journalists will want to ask him about the wider picture and, to be honest, it's doesn't look good. </p> <p>The Independent is running a story today saying Labour is <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/polls-show-labour-flatlining-as-tories-stretch-their-lead-925565.html\">\"flatlining in the polls and showing no signs of making a recovery\"</a>. </p> <p>The Times is running its own polling figures saying <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4727373.ece\">that Brown is now seen as being \"much further away from the position of the average voter than Tony Blair was when he was prime minister\".</a> </p> <p>(In the paper, but not on the web, the story is accompanied by a graphic that's almost as incomprehensible as those Large Hadron Collider explainers - but the gist of it is bad for Gordon.) </p> <p>And The Times also reports that David Cameron has made the cover of the influential American magazine Time, which is describing him as a man of <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4727878.ece\">\"mind-blowing confidence\".</a> Wonder if Brown gets asked about that.</p> <p><strong>10am</strong></p> <p>Brown arrives. He says he's going to be talking about energy. \"We all know we need a real and lasting change in the way we use energy\".</p> <p>There will be \"immediate help\" for those who need it most, but most of the package will concentrate on helping people save energy. It will cost \u00a31bn.</p> <p>All low-income and pensioners households will be eligible for energy saving measures that could save them an average of \u00a3300 a year.</p> <p>All households will be qualify for some sort of energy saving support.</p> <p>Around 600,000 households will benefit from \"social tariffs\", ie cheaper bills.</p> <p>The severe weather payments will be increased to \u00a325 a week.</p> <p>From tomorrow, a national information campaign will publicise all the help that is available.</p> <p>To pay for the package, the government will introduce legislation when parliament resumes to get \u00a3920m from energy firms and power providers.</p> <p>Ofgem is reviewing the competitiveness of the energy market. If there is any evidence of anti-competitive action, the government will not hesitate to act.</p> <p><strong>10.05am</strong></p> <p>Brown asks Hilary Benn, the environment secretary, to provide more details.</p> <p>Benn says there will be a community energy saving programme. He says that investing in loft insulation can save you \u00a3100, and cavity wall insulation can save you \u00a3150 a year.</p> <p>Energy companies will be writing to customers with details. There is also a hotline that people can ring.</p> <p>Brown says that John Hutton, the business secretary, is with him. But Hutton isn't invited to speak.</p> <p><strong>Windfall tax/energy</strong></p> <p>Nick Robinson asks if a windfall tax has been ruled out for good.</p> <p>Brown says he looked at all options, and that the ones announced today were the best ones. Today's package meets his objectives. He says he does not expect the costs being met by the energy companies to be passed on to the consumers.</p> <p>As for how many people will benefit, he says around 2 million will benefit from the insulation measures, and around 1.5 million from energy-saving devices.</p> <p>Benn says 12 million pensioner households are already benefiting from the winter fuel payments.</p> <p>The community programme will help around 90,000 households.</p> <p>Because of the decline in housebuilding, there is \"capacity in the system\" - ie unemployed builders free to install the insulation.</p> <p>Brown confirms something I missed earlier. All households will qualify for a 50% subsidy for insulation.</p> <p><strong>Election</strong></p> <p>Tom Bradby from ITN asks if Brown regrets not calling an election last year.</p> <p>No, says Brown. He said at the time that he wanted to show people what he stood for. He made the \"right decision\" last year.</p> <p><strong>10.15am</strong></p> <p><strong>9/11</strong></p> <p>Adam Boulton from Sky points out that it's the 9/11 anniversary. What's Brown's assessment of the current terror threat. And, in the light of the outcome of the Heathrow terror plot, does Brown think it is right to talk about the war on terror.</p> <p>Brown says Britain is \"vigilant\" in showing itself ready to protect itself from terrorism.</p> <p>But it is not possible to say anything other than \"that we are permanently on our guard\".</p> <p>What is happening in Afghanistan is important too.</p> <p><strong>Energy companies</strong></p> <p>Asked about the remarks from the E.ON boss who said that a harsh winter would mean more profits, Brown said that there had been an apology. He had been \"aghast\" at the comments.</p> <p>He points out that the energy companies will be providing a considerable amount of money. \"We do not expect that to be passed on in prices to the consumers.\"</p> <p>Hutton comes in for the first time. \"If there is any evidence that customers are being ripped off ... then the government won't hesitate to intervene.\"</p> <p>Over the last five years energy customers in the UK have enjoyed lower prices than the EU average because of the competitive energy market.</p> <p><strong>Relations with the chancellor/football</strong></p> <p>George Pascoe-Watson, political editor of the Sun, asks about last night's football, and Brown's relationship with Alistair Darling. Brown seems to fudge the chancellor issue, muttering something about \"getting on with business\". But he's much more expansive about the football.</p> <p><strong>10.20am</strong></p> <p><strong>Leadership</strong></p> <p>Cathy Newman from Channel 4 says Brown blames the global economy for Labour's problems. But does he ever have a \"dark night of the soul\" and think he might be the problems?</p> <p>Good question.</p> <p>But Brown doesn't rise to it. He rattles of the list of global economic problems. His job, he says, is to deal with them. The world is \"never going to be the same again\".</p> <p>Does he taker personal responsibility, Newman asks.</p> <p>Of course, says Brown. \"I'm the person who's in charge.\"</p> <p>Brown seems to be distinguishing between responsibility, which he accepts, and blame, which he doesn't.</p> <p><strong>Oil companies</strong></p> <p>Brown says he has already raised the taxation on oil companies.</p> <p><strong>Economy</strong></p> <p>Macer Hall from the Express asks why the EU and the OECD say Britain is the only major economy facing recession.</p> <p>Brown doesn't address this directly. He says governments have to take the right decisions that are appropriate for them. </p> <p>He has taken the right decisions about nuclear power, about climate change, about infrastructure. He says other countries had negative growth when Britain didn't. We will have to \"wait and see\" to find out what the figures are for 2008.</p> <p><strong>President Sarkozy</strong></p> <p>A foreign journalist asks if Brown supports Sarkozy's foreign policies.</p> <p>Brown says he supports what Sarkozy has done over Georgia.</p> <p>The world is changing fast, he says. The reason why oil prices are rising is simple - demand exceeds supply.</p> <p><strong>Zimbabwe</strong></p> <p>Would a power-sharing deal that left Mugabe with some kind of power be acceptable?</p> <p>Brown says he wants an outcome that reflects the will of the Zimbabwean people. He wants a \"transition\" that would allow the MDC to have its legitimate place in the government of Zimbabwe.</p> <p><strong>Energy package</strong></p> <p>Will it seem like \"jam tomorrow\"?</p> <p>No, says Brown, because most people understand that there has to be a long-term change in the way we use energy.</p> <p>People realise that they can cut their use of energy \"quite significantly\".</p> <p><strong>10.30am</strong></p> <p><strong>Iran</strong></p> <p>A journalist from Fox News asks where Brown stands on Iran.</p> <p>Brown says the west has made a \"generous offer\" to Iran, requiring a freeze in its nuclear programme. There is wide international support for that position.</p> <p><strong>Metropolitan police</strong></p> <p>Ben Brogan from the Daily Mail asks if Brown is confident that Sir Ian Blair is \"still keeping his eye on the ball\" given the various discrimination cases he's dealing with.</p> <p>Brown praises the Met's records. He does not comment on Blair specifically.</p> <p><strong>Labour conference</strong></p> <p>Jason Beattie from the Mirror wants to know what Brown's message to Labour supporters will be.</p> <p>Brown says it will be the same as his message to the whole country. \"When you face challenging times, you get on with the job.\" The Labour government is \"on the side of hard-working families\".</p> <p><strong>Glenrothes byelection</strong></p> <p>Will Brown visit the constituency during the byelection campaign?</p> <p>Brown says he was there last Friday, in his capacity of chancellor of a local college. (He was not accompanied by the Labour candidate when he went). He did not say if he would be going back.</p> <p><strong>Lebanon</strong></p> <p>Brown says he's opposed to Syrian interference in Lebanon.</p> <p><strong>Terrorism</strong></p> <p>Asked about compensation for a terrorism victim, Brown says he will look into it.</p> <p><strong>Energy summit</strong></p> <p>A foreign journalist asks who will be invited to Brown's planned energy summit.</p> <p>Brown says he is still considering the guest list.</p> <p><strong>Ian Blair/Afghanistan</strong></p> <p>Does Sir Ian Blair have Brown's confidence?</p> <p>Yes, says Brown to the Blair question.</p> <p>On Afghanistan, he says he wants \"a fair sharing\" of the burden. Other countries are being asked to contribute.</p> <p><strong>Energy package</strong></p> <p>George Parker from the FT asks how the government will know whether energy companies are passing costs of the fuel package on to their customers.</p> <p>Brown says he does not expect that they will pass on the costs. \"I don't think there's a need to do so, and I don't expect it to happen.\" Which doesn't really answer the question.</p> <p>Hutton says Ofgem police the market in the interests of consumers.</p> <p>Brown says that if there is any evidence of unacceptable behaviour, the government will act.</p> <p><strong>Lisbon treaty</strong></p> <p>How much time have the Irish left to sort out the Lisbon treaty issue?</p> <p>Brown says this is a matter for the Irish. Brian Cowen, the Irish PM, will report to fellow EU leaders at their next meeting in October.</p> <p><strong>10.40am</strong></p> <p><strong>Leadership</strong></p> <p>Andy Grice from the Independent asks what Brown would say to voters who say that since Brown took credit for the economy was going well, he should take responsibility wen thing go badly.</p> <p>Brown says he does take responsibility. </p> <p>In any other country facing these circumstances, there would be a recession.</p> <p>The issue is how you deal with the problem. Compared to the 1990s, circumstances are much better. Company balance books are still healthy. The size of the world economy is going to double over the next 20 years and Britain is \"well-equipped to benefit\".</p> <p><strong>Russia</strong></p> <p>Brown says he wants a good relationship with Russia. But Britiain cannot allow a country like the UK to be \"wholly dependent\" on a single energy source.</p> <p><strong>Angola</strong></p> <p>Brown is asked about the elections in Angola. He says he can't comment on the elections there.</p> <p><strong>Reshuffle/Miliband</strong></p> <p>Quentin Letts from the Daily Mail asks if there will be a reshuffle. With a smile, Brown says he is being generous in taking a question from Letts (a severe Brown critic). But he won't comment on reshuffles.</p> <p><strong>Energy package</strong></p> <p>Asked why the government cut the warm front programme, Brown says he is now increasing funding.</p> <p>And in reference to Patrick Wintour's question about the windfall tax - Wintour asked what Brown would do if the Labour conference voted for a windfall tax - Brown doesn't explicitly say he will ignore the vote. But he reaffirms his belief that the approach he's taking his the best one.</p> <p>Benn says the total investment over the next three year to deal with this problem will be \u00a36.5bn.</p> <p><strong>10.50am</strong></p> <p><strong>Scotland</strong></p> <p>Michael Settle from the Herald asks why Brown is in favour of Scotland having further tax-raising powers. Brown says that is not his position. His speech to the Scottish CBI did not go further than what he had said already.</p> <p><strong>Sustainable investment rule</strong></p> <p>Asked if he is now prepared to see debt rise above 40% of GDP (which would breach the sustainable investment rule), Brown says this is a matter for the pre-budget report. But he says these are \"quite unique times\", suggesting that the government will rewrite the rule.</p> <p><strong>Recover/election</strong></p> <p>Joe Murphy asks Brown when the recovery will start, and whether he will rule out an election next year.</p> <p>Brown refuses to answer on both counts.</p> <p><strong>Racism in the police</strong></p> <p>Brown says any racism is unacceptable. But he does not say whether he thinks the problem is getting worse.</p> <p><strong>Pakistan</strong></p> <p>Brown says the new Pakistani president will be visiting Britain soon.</p> <p><strong>Immigration</strong></p> <p>A Chinese journalists asks about the new regulations preventing certain categories of workers coming to Britain (like care home assistants).</p> <p>Brown defends the new points system.</p> <p>Where people are in the country and vulnerable, the government will protect them from exploitation.</p> <p><strong>Afghanistan</strong></p> <p>An Australian journalist says the Australian PM, Kevin Rudd, has ruled out increasing troop numbers to Afghanistan.</p> <p>Brown says he has spoken to Rudd about this. America, France and Britain are increasing troop numbers.</p> <p>Was Brown disappointed, she asks again?</p> <p>No, Brown says.</p> <p>Brown says everyone has now had a question. \"It's good to see you again,\" he says on the way out. Not sure he means it.</p> <p><strong>Instant summary</strong></p> <p><strong>The relaunch message:</strong> Anyone expecting a new message from the prime minister to accompany the autumn relaunch will be disappointed. There was no admission that he might have made mistakes in the past, no contrite tone, no renewed emphasis on cabinet government. Instead he reaffirmed, as he had done endlessly before, that he is taking the right long-term decisions for Britain. If message discipline was the only thing that mattered in politics, Brown would be unbeatable.</p> <p><strong>Energy package:</strong> A substantial package, that Brown defended well. But Brown (and Hutton) could not explain how they were sure that the costs would not be passed on to customers. There was some strong language about dealing with market abuses - Hutton at one point said the government would come down \"like a ton of bricks\" on companies engaged in anti-competitive packages - but it's up to Ofgem to decide whether there are abuses. </p> <p>Brown also would not be drawn on what would happen if the Labour conference votes for a windfall tax. Presumably because the answer is embarrassing - he will ignore them, which is what the Labour leadership normally does when conference votes against it.</p> <p><strong>Brown's economic rules:</strong> It sounds as if they're about to be written. Asked if he was still committed to keeping debt below 40% of GDP, Brown said we would have to wait until the pre-budget review. But he referred to \"quite unique times\", which sounds as if he's preparing an alibi for tearing up the sustainable development rule, the one dealing with 40%.</p> <p><strong>Glenrothes byelection:</strong> Brown would not commit himself to visiting the constituency again, after the writ is moved and when campaigning starts in earnest, but he said that he went last week. Will this be his only visit, allowing him to refute claims that he has stayed away?</p> <p><strong>Responsibility/blame:</strong> Brown at least twice said he was taking responsibility for what the government has been doing. This seems to be the formula he will use when asked if he personally has contributed to the government's woes.</p> <p><strong>Confidence in Sir Ian Blair:</strong> Brown said had had full confidence in Sir Ian Blair, the embattled Met police chief. Blair will be grateful. But, realistically, he could not have said anything else.</p> <p><strong>E.ON boss:</strong> Brown was very critical of Mark Owen-Lloyd, the E.ON boss, who joked that a cold winter would be good for profits. Brown's remarks will probably go down well with Labour MPs, but they would still prefer a windfall tax. </p>",

  "<p><strong>Rupert Murdoch</strong> is the last hope for quality newspapers, according to <strong>Mark Scott</strong>, the managing director of Australia's public service broadcaster, <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/\">ABC</a>. After describing the Australian print media industry as a \"pageant of distrust, misery and dashed hopes\" he said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Through all the turmoil within the Australian media industry, there is only one print mogul who has diversified his portfolio enough to offset the costs of quality journalism against profits made elsewhere in his business. And yes \u2013 that last, best hope for newspapers is Rupert Murdoch.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Scott, drawing on <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/10/wolff200810\">the <strong>Vanity Fair</strong> teaser </a> to <strong>Michael Wolff's</strong> upcoming Murdoch biography, quoted the claim that Murdoch \"may be the last person to love newspapers\". He went on:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The newspaper groups that are surviving well internationally are those that have kept some newspaper products and diversified significantly into other areas as well. That's what Rupert Murdoch has done. Rupert Murdoch has diversified significantly away from newspapers. </p> <p>\"That allows his newspapers, particularly in Australia, to operate under a different model and different fiscal pressures than those companies where newspapers dominate the earnings of the company.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>This was no off-the-cuff observation, but part of <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24327383-7582,00.html\">a considered speech to Australia's national press club</a>. Leaving aside Scott's hyperbolic \"last, best hope\" claim (which has to be seen in an Australian rather than a global context), he is surely correct about the need for newspaper publishers to diversify. Newspaper-only companies, unless they can pull off the virtually impossible trick of maintaining profits during the switch from newsprint to online, will not survive.</p> <p>Diversification of some kind, allowing for the diverting of profits from another sector to underpin loss-making newsprint publications, is the <em><strong>only</strong></em> way that newspapers have any hope of a future. I also have a hunch that Scott is correct in his assessment that \"quality\" papers stand the best chance because they will serve a small but affluent audience.</p> <p>That said, there is no earthly reason why Murdoch should not pump money made elsewhere in his <a href=\"http://www.newscorp.com/\">News Corp</a> empire into his largest-selling British titles, <strong>The Sun</strong> and <strong>News of the World</strong>, in order to ensure that they are (among) the last popular papers left standing in the next decade. Then again, will his eventual successor have the same affection for those red-tops as Murdoch?</p>",
