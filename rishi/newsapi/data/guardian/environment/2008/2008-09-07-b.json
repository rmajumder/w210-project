Executives were busy interviewing hopefuls for 40 new staff positions, which include a position data and mapping expert and digital technologist. And today, the Telegraph Media Group plans to function without a single casual reporter - a historic day in Fleet Street.</p> <p>If the newspaper industry is undergoing a revolution, then the Telegraph is perhaps more like France than most. Since the Barclay brothers bought the titles and the Spectator for \u00a3665m in June 2004, five editors have come and gone and the rate and pace of change at the biggest-selling quality daily newspaper has surprised rivals and staff alike. In integrating the daily title with its Sunday sister and online counterpart, Will Lewis, editor in chief of the Telegraph Media Group and editor of the Daily Telegraph for the past two years, has dragged a group once seen as gentlemanly and old-fashioned into the digital era. On one level, the changes have already worked. While the latest circulation figures show a year-on-year decline of the daily title by 3% to 887,664 in August, unique users to Telegraph.co.uk have more than doubled to 18,746,025 over the past year.</p> <p><strong>Stars on high salaries</strong><br>Friday's ABC figures also suggest that the title is weathering the downward circulation trend better than many of its quality rivals even before the tardy colour launch (although just 44% were sold at full cover price). Its once-derided subscription model is now being copied by at least one of its nearest rivals, the Times. Executives point to the millions invested in the Victoria HQ and the multimedia expansion, and say the editorial budget has never been higher. Yet staff discontent, fuelled by the drastic upheaval to working conditions and editorial judgements , has never seemed greater.</p> <p>Last week's full colour launch - after difficult print site negotiations - was welcomed by Lewis. He downplays talk of a revolution, describing the launch as an \"evolution\". \"This is a big thing for us, the market-leading newspaper, to have colour,\" he says, suggesting that the paper decided a softly-softly approach would be best for readers. \"It's not about trying to impress any Guardian aficionados. We haven't made any radical changes.\" Yet the plan to denude the company of casual workers, so long a mainstay of Fleet Street, is radical, and vital to both the Telegraph titles' continuing integration and its plans to keep website readership surging by employing web specialists. By October 13, all casual production staff will have followed reporters out of the door. </p> <p>In a letter to casuals, the executive director of editorial, Richard Ellis, said: \"TMG will use no casuals whatsoever\" after this time, describing the 40 new staff roles as \"wide-ranging and exciting\". There are to be about 18 content editors who will write, commission and edit across online and print as well as six reporters, five part-time production roles and seven \"new world\" roles, such as a digital technologist geo-tagging news stories for local readers. </p> <p>The high-tech titles of the jobs have caused some angst among staff, but Lewis says, \"I must be the only editor in the UK appointing people to jobs. This must be a golden time for our organisation.\" </p> <p>Such comments mark a contrast to many of those who have left the Telegraph titles in the past four years. Disgruntled members of this diaspora have compared Lewis and a team dominated by former Associated Newspapers executives with the Khmer Rouge wreaking Year Zero on a once great institution, and building a downmarket \"Daily Mailygraph\" in its place. Executives, on the other hand, suggest they razed the doomed country club of the old Telegraph and built a digital Jerusalem in its place. </p> <p>The gap between these views is perhaps at the heart of why current relations seem so fraught. The ballot has been called because of changed working practices. Among other things management is accused of failing to honour the guarantee that helped to stave off the last planned strike, in December 2006, that staff would work a maximum of 15 Saturdays a year. </p> <p>The dispute centres on 62 production workers whom management want to move from a nine-day to a 10-day fortnight. \"I didn't expect to be cheered to the rafters doing that,\" says Lewis. \"If you say there are still some unhappy people, then I am sure there are - it's not Disneyland here.\" </p> <p>But if he didn't remove the casuals, which he thinks the company is too reliant on, staff jobs would have had to go, he says. There are 30 casuals work more than four days per week but many more working less. After the latest round of hires, the group will have 550 staff journalists spread over three platforms compared with 520 when the Barclays took over. These figures hide an enormous turnaround of staff, however, with two big rounds of redundancies, many departures and a host of new hirings from rival newspapers. These new arrivals tend to be much more positive about working at the Telegraph, of course, compared with some longer serving members of staff.</p> <p>The union negotiations are being handled by Ellis, who reports to the chief executive, Murdoch MacLennan. The union say that they have repeatedly tried to take the matter to the reconciliation service Acas and are getting knocked back. </p> <p>Chris Howe, made father of chapel after his predecessor was made redundant in June, says: \"Forty new jobs is a great-sounding headline, but many, many more so-called 'casual' workers are being dismissed across all departments, some of whom have been working here regularly for many years. We can see that the new jobs won't fill the gap because of the punitive changes being imposed on existing staff to cover the extra workload.\"</p> <p>Howe charges that the Telegraph's management fails to respect its agreements or negotiate. \"And the last thing we want is to damage the Telegraph. We are determined to protect the reputation of a great paper from a management that has made an ideology out of bad industrial relations.\"</p> <p>Posted this week, the ballot results are expected in six weeks. The union says it had 205 members at the last audit but has added more recently. It has not been known for activism.</p> <p>Lewis, who says that he has spent a long time briefing journalists about the changes, does not think that a strike will happen. \"I would be staggered - but if they do I will deal with it,\" he says. </p> <p>TMG is not the only company making journalists redundant, of course. After the merger of the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and the People features desks, and the cutting of eight desk editing posts at the Daily Mirror, staff said last week that they fear it is becoming like the Daily Express, a reference to the swingeing cost cuts at the Richard Desmond title. The Guardian has instituted a programme of voluntary redundancies in editorial to rebalance its staff and recruit more web journalists. </p> <p>But at the Telegraph relations have seemed so much tougher, partly due to the scale and pace of change.The City desk, which pioneered integration, has seen 10 staff leaving in the past year and the departure of Paul Hill, the linchpin of the foreign desk with 37 years' service, also hit staff morale. His staff accorded him the old Fleet Street printers' farewell of a banging out. </p> <p>Ben Rooney, a staff journalist in the 1990s who left a part-time job on the foreign desk after Hill's departure earlier this year, echoes other former staff critical of what he describes as the paper apeing of its downmarket rivals, with desk editors forced to check the Daily Mail's website constantly and berated for failing to follow stories. \"Even if they were utter shite, you had to run them, or face a grilling if you didn't,\" he says. Senior Telegraph executives dismiss the suggestion that they have gone downmarket, saying that they have simply imported the Mail high standards and rigour. </p> <p>In an interview last year, Lewis said: \"Each of the people that we have recruited from Associated have awed me with their professionalism, their work ethic, their technical skills, their creativity, which is often overlooked.\" </p> <p>At that time he also said his longterm strategy was only half complete and there was much more to be done in pushing Telegraph content out deeper and deeper into the web. Since then the economic downturn has given pause for thought, but the pace of change has continued.</p> <p>Last week Lewis said he had to ensure that the strategy of creating a global media operation does not \"lose momentum\" while the company \"battens down the hatches\". There is little sign that the revolution at the Telegraph is slowing down.</p> <h2>Four years of change at the Telegraph</h2> <p><strong>2004: Barclays take over</strong><br>David and Frederick Barclay take control after Conrad Black fails to thwart the \u00a3665m sale.

  "<p>It was not the reported claim that Uma Thurman looked \"angry and upset\" at Heathrow's Terminal 5 that riled British Airways. After all, BA had handled its fair share of flustered passengers at T5. What angered BA executives was the anonymous quote, in the same newspaper article, from a senior manager at a \"major rival\" airline: \"That is the trouble with such a large terminal. It doesn't work for the passenger. I regularly use T3 and always get through in 15 to 20 minutes.\"</p> <p>BA's patience, worn thin by relentlessly hostile coverage of T5, was close to breaking point. According to sources familiar with internal discussions at the flag carrier at the time, the airline was convinced that Virgin Atlantic - which is based at T3 - was behind the quote and had gone too far after months of negative briefings.</p> <p>\"BA was infuriated by the constant sniping,\" said one source. \"The David and Goliath act has been going on for years but everybody who operates at Heathrow has to deal with a difficult operating environment and to pretend that only BA suffers as a result ... Well, that's stretching the truth a bit.\" </p> <p>What followed was a series of public exchanges between BA and Virgin Atlantic that culminated last week in an eccentric slanging match. It also renewed hostilities in a bitter rivalry made famous in the early 1990s by the \"dirty tricks\" campaign, when BA was accused of poaching its rival's customers and tampering with confidential files.</p> <p>So, smarting from that Evening Standard article on June 5, BA began to hit back. Last month, BA's chief executive, Willie Walsh, took the fight to Sir Richard Branson, Virgin Atlantic's founder and president. The combative Dubliner said Branson's arguments against a proposed tie-up between BA and American Airlines sounded like a \"cracked record\", followed a fortnight later by BA taking the unusual step of criticising its rival's full-year results. </p> <p>In an official statement, the airline belittled its competitor's 2.6% profit margin and trumpeted its recent achievement of a 10% margin. \"British Airways achieved a pre-tax profit margin ... nearly four times higher,\" said BA. </p> <p>It is understood BA decided to gatecrash Virgin Atlantic's results because Branson's press team had tried to do exactly the same at the beginning of August. Virgin Atlantic claimed an 88% fall in BA's first-quarter profits was not solely due to high fuel costs but that the botched opening of T5 had also led to the airline losing customers. Highly sensitive to any more bad publicity about T5, BA was furious.</p> <p>The spat reached a highly personal pitch two weeks ago as one of the most dramatic episodes in the airlines' tortuous relationship was dragged into the argument. Branson stated in an interview that Virgin Atlantic kept BA \"honest\", implying that his carrier had kept BA on its toes by providing strong competition. </p> <p>Walsh found this a bit rich, given that Virgin Atlantic willingly fixed fuel surcharges with BA between August 2004 and January 2006, robbing passengers of millions of pounds. Using his weekly column in BA's inhouse newspaper, British Airways News, Walsh challenged his counterpart to discuss the scandal: \"I made it clear that I had no involvement in or knowledge of the price-fixing with Virgin ... I honestly can't recall Branson giving any personal interviews on the price-fixing activities of his company. It's about the only thing I haven't heard 'honest' Richard Branson talk about.\" </p> <p>Last year, Walsh said pointedly that he would be \"very happy\" if the full details of the scandal came out - but refused to comment when asked if he was referring to Virgin Atlantic's involvement.</p> <p>Branson responded to Walsh's column by stating he had appeared on the BBC's Money Programme to discuss the scam, for which BA was fined \u00a3271.5m after Virgin Atlantic blew the whistle. </p> <p>Walsh fired another salvo from his column. He said: \"I checked. He did indeed appear on the Money Programme in early October 2006. Having watched the programme again I still couldn't find the section where he condemned price-fixing ... So, I still cannot recall 'honest' Richard Branson giving any personal interviews about the issue.\" </p> <p>Branson shot back: \"It is no wonder that BA is in the state it is if Willie Walsh has the time to watch past editions of the Money Programme.\"</p> <p>BA and Virgin Atlantic both declined to comment. But with the price-fixing scandal going to a criminal trial and the BA/AA deal facing a regulatory investigation, few expect a ceasefire. The most angry and upset people in Heathrow over the next year may not be Hollywood stars but BA and Virgin Atlantic executives.</p>",
  "<p>Your uncritical presentation of a recent academic study alleging that \"institutional racism\" is the main factor in black pupil underachievement was hardly news (Black Caribbean children held back by institutional racism in schools, September 5). This ideological-based claim that it is teachers' low expectations, particularly for children of Caribbean origin, which make them achieve low GCSE and A-level grades has been around for decades. </p> <p>Yet the only exhaustive, comprehensive and authoritative study of the subject - the Swann Report of 1985 - categorically dismissed those claims after seven years' detailed research by leading educational and ethnic minority issue specialists in the field. One hopes that the British Educational Research Association conference will examine Dr Strand's study rigorously, as to whether his findings and conclusions provide new evidence which was not considered and rejected by Swann. </p> <p>When it was a major issue in the 1980s, this focus on a blame-laden but evidentially unproven factor - alleged teachers' and educational authority racism - caused serious black community distrust in the whole educational system, without in any way helping them to tackle the complex and multi-factorial problems which all the studies acknowledged. </p> <p>The political reaction to the excesses of many London councils' well-intentioned but ill-considered \"anti-racist\" policies (such as Brent's notorious persecution of \"racist\" headteacher Maureen McGoldrick and their wild \"race spies in the classrooms\" programme) enabled the radical right to exploit all parent and public concerns about how education was run. The results, starting with the Education Act 1988, are with us today. Twenty years on, we really should expect a more balanced treatment of such sensitive issues.<br><strong>Cllr Dr James Moher</strong> <br>Lab, Brent; author of Stepping on White Corns - Race, Education and Politics: the Brent Experience</p> <p>The underachievement of black children is not a new phenomenon. Nor is the notion of low teacher expectation leading to poor pupil performance. Bernard Coard in 1971 researched the issue in his book: How the West Indian Child is Made Educationally Subnormal in the British School System. The Rampton committee (later to become the Swann committee) reported on the underachievement of black children and there have been numerous pieces of research on the relationship between teacher expectation and pupil performance - notably one where researchers supposedly identified children who would \"spurt\" over a six-month period - and they did. The researchers then revealed to the teachers that the children had been selected at random. They \"spurted\" because teachers believed that they would. </p> <p>More damning was 1980s research into one large education authority (I shan't name it as it may have changed since then) which showed that, exactly like today, white students were put into higher academic sets (with a possibility of achieving A-grades) when their performance was worse than that of their black peers - who were put into sets where an A-grade was not a possibility.</p> <p>What is so appalling is that over 35 years since Coard's research, and 25-plus years since Rampton and Swann, for black children nothing has changed and teachers continue to make stereotypical false assumptions - and continue to fail and blame them.<br><strong>Carole Underwood</strong><br>Kendal, Cumbria</p> <p>Tony Sewell's indictment (Comment, September 6) of the intellectually lightweight study from Warwick University of the poor performance of African-Caribbean children in our schools was electrifying. It is supported by the evidence collected by Professor James Flynn of Otago University on IQ among black children in the US and the black offspring of US servicemen in Germany; the latter, not exposed to the corrosive male machismo subculture of US inner cities, have the same IQ as white children fathered by white servicemen, whereas in the US the gap between whites and blacks at age 24 is 16 points (see New Scientist, September 6 2008). It is not hard to extend the argument that the culture many children are exposed to in the UK (content-free newspapers and TV, celebrity worship and so on) has a similar effect - especially as so many white youths copy the attitudes and style of black role models, dismissing education as something oppressive imposed by the snobbish establishment. <br><strong>Mike Rennie</strong><br>Derby</p> <p>Your article was dispiriting and prompted me to look up a letter I sent to my local education authority when I resigned as chair from a secondary school parent-staff association in 2005. My letter raised similar concerns - some which related to my mixed-race daughter's experience of the school environment.</p> <p>But what concerned me then and now is the lack of a systematic strategy to address the underachievement and stereotyping of black and mixed-race children over time. This needs to be multi-dimensional as Tony Sewell suggests. It also needs to look at difficult issues such as some teachers' fear of black young people, the impact of the gun and knife culture, and the middle-class exodus that exists with secondary schools. </p> <p>It's good to hear about the introduction of study into slavery in the school curriculum and its direct and indirect impact on our economy, culture and psyche. Hopefully well-researched studies like Warwick's alongside the campaigns of parents, their families and educationists will prompt action and more fundamental change. We may get somewhere in realising the potential of those \"difficult black kids\".<br><strong>Guy Farrar</strong><br>Leeds</p>",
  "<p>The site does not look impressive: a fenced-off farmer's field next to an old barn in a quiet Welsh valley with a sign that warns parents to keep children away. There are no drills or rigs or gangs of workers. But if the experts have got it right, an energy revolution could be about to take place in coal-rich valleys across south Wales. </p> <p>An Australian energy company announced last week that recently completed test drilling in a field in the Llynfi Valley near Bridgend and two further sites has revealed huge quantities of high-quality coalbed methane (CBM) gas, which it says could be piped out and used to help ease Britain's growing energy crisis. </p> <p>In the area that Eden Energy has explored - a block of 230 square kilometres - it is believed there may be enough coalbed methane to meet 5% of the whole of the UK's energy need for a year. Eden, which is working with two British companies, says there may be four or five more blocks in Wales alone that could provide a similar amount of energy or even more. </p> <p>The announcement has been welcomed by politicians, who are coming to see coalbed methane as one of the ways of making Britain's energy supply more secure, and some environmentalists who believe the use of coalbed methane could help provide a breathing space while green energy technologies are developed.</p> <p>That means that a gas that was once the arch-enemy of mining communities because of the devastating underground explosions it caused could now create jobs in areas still blighted by the closure of the pits and provide local industry with a source of local, and hopefully cheaper, power. Greg Solomon, executive chairman of Eden Energy, said: \"We are sitting on a major resource of methane at a time when prices for this commodity have never been higher. There is a significant quantity of energy that could be tapped here.\" </p> <p>Huw Irranca-Davies, MP for Ogmore in south Wales, said: \"It's very exciting. There's huge potential. I think people are going to be very supportive when they realise just what we have got here.\" </p> <p>Previously the government has seemed sceptical about coalbed methane but yesterday the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform described the new efforts to tap the energy source in Wales and elsewhere as \"encouraging\". It said that one in three of the licences granted for onshore oil and gas exploration this year concerned coalbed methane. </p> <p>CBM, which clings to the surface of coal in unmined beds, is an important energy source for the US, Canada and Australia. As well as exploring for gas in Wales, Eden Energy has the rights to areas including Somerset and Kent and other companies are exploring Scotland. </p> <p>But Wales is proving particularly exciting because the coal is so \"gassy\", comparable in quantity and quality to that found in parts of Australia, according to Eden. Neil Crumpton, a Friends of the Earth energy expert, looked at Eden's figures for the Guardian and calculated that CBM from this first area could supply 5% or 6% of the UK for a whole year. </p> <p>There have been complaints from some environmental groups in the US that drilling for CBM in the Rockies is having an impact on the wilderness, but those behind the exploration in south Wales say that drilling would be done from a series of rigs no bigger than a two-storey house. And rigs would not be needed every few hundred metres - instead engineers can drill down and then out to a kilometre horizontally.</p> <p>In the Llynfi Valley there is excitement at the news. Wyn Davies, clerk to two local community councils, said: \"We've been told that gas from just one seam would power 1,000 homes for 100 years.\" </p> <p>Test drilling is complete in the Llynfi Valley and at two other sites near Port Talbot and Pencoed. Eden says that between six and 10 further test drillings are likely to take place in the next 12 months - after which the coalbed methane rush could begin.</p> <h2>Explainer</h2> <p>Methane is a <strong>natural gas</strong>, which arises out of the decay of <strong>organic matter</strong>. Over many centuries as coal deposits are formed, some methane is absorbed by the coal. Methane can continue to <strong>seep out </strong>of disused coalmines - bad news for the environment as it is a <strong>greenhouse gas</strong>. There are two main ways of exploiting methane from coal seams. A number of companies in the UK <strong>capture</strong> escaping coalmine methane and use it to generate electricity. Methane locked into unworked seams can also be <strong>drilled for</strong>.</p>",
  "<p>Steve Chalke, a Baptist minister with a motor mouth and bags of charm, is a very busy man. Six new academies run by his charity, Oasis, have just begun their first terms. Oasis already had three, and another three more are planned for next year. Opening one academy in Bristol late last week, Chalke explained, between bursts of loud cheering in the background, his idea of a faith school. Oasis often uses the same buildings, at least initially, as the local education authority did; it adopts the same admission policies and same staff; sometimes, all that Oasis adds to the school is \"membership of a global movement, Oasis, which is working to transform communities\", based on a vision that is \"person-centered, inclusive, servant-minded - we believe in redemption and transformation and that every person matters\". Everyone has to buy into the values, but not necessarily the belief in Jesus Christ, he adds.</p> <p>This is the kind of rhetoric that incenses critics of faith schools. Why is Andrew Adonis lavishing failing schools on a man with more experience of preaching than of teaching? The expansion of faith schools is a hard-hat area of education policy: you enter at your peril, to face a long-standing league of critics, now newly emboldened with a fashionable fear of Islam, and of religion more generally.</p> <p>So, with hard hat on, here goes the defence: that it is possible to justify faith schools within the state sector with important qualifications; that many of them do a remarkable job; and that it's time the critics put prejudice aside to think more carefully about the source of their appeal to parents.</p> <p>Ethos is the ghost in the machine in education. Everyone recognises it when they see it; parents want it; politicians regard it with awe, but how do you produce it? Most would agree that it's the result of a common set of values articulated by the head and shared by staff, governors, pupils and parents. Get that communal consensus motivated around high aspirations, mutual respect and self-discipline, and you have a successful, well-ordered school. </p> <p>But these are old-fashioned ideas. Walk into any secondary school and one senses how counter-cultural that ethos is. The blazers, badges, Latin mottos, the \"Morning, Sir,\" the emphasis on tradition, formality and obedience: it's an institutional culture decades old. Teachers have the unenviable task of battling against a culture of self-entitlement, individualism and self-promotion to try to generate a common purpose. </p> <p>This is where faith schools can have an advantage. They can fall back on a well-known, religious narrative to which there is still considerable adherence in some form. As the last census showed, over 70% of people in this country still describe themselves as Christian; that may not mean going to church but it may mean wanting children to grow up with broadly Christian values. For a faith school, the common values are familiar to all and easy to explain, and therein lies the possibility of a strong ethos.</p> <p>That is not to say that non-religious schools can't achieve this - of course they can, but it is harder. Secular ethical traditions are honourable but they lack the familiarity, the symbols, the narratives and histories that bring the abstract to emotional life. These issues of character formation have been the subject of two fascinating essays in recent issues of the magazine Prospect. Edward Skidelsky argues that both the secular and sacred \"languages\" underpinning the values of self-discipline and responsibility have been badly eroded. Secular humanism has not found a popular ethical narrative to replace faith; parents, uncertain how to bring up their children with a sense of responsibility for others, resort to school Christianity.</p> <p>Perhaps this is how faith schools have successfully sustained the buy-in of the middle class. It's part of what comprehensive education is about: all children from all backgrounds within a faith community so that the middle classes bring their commitment to education into the mix. This is precisely what so many failing schools have not got, while the middle classes desert the state system to take refuge in highly selective, expensive private schools. So why criticise a part of the system that works?</p> <p>In the vituperative debate on faith schools, a continuing programme of research from the London School of Economics has been used as ammunition by the critics, as it shows that faith schools have a lower proportion of children on free school meals. Critics accuse them of \"cherry-picking\" the more affluent pupils. But Sandra McNally, director of education and skills at the LSE's Centre for Economic Performance, has also analysed the figures nationally and concludes that, although the average proportion of pupils on free meals in secondary schools is 12.9% for Catholic, 10.8% for other religious, and 14% for non-religious, we don't know whether this is evidence of faith schools choosing more affluent pupils or of a bigger proportion of their applicants coming from more affluent homes. The disparity is bigger at primary school level; is this because primary schools are cleverer at weeding out the poor or because many middle-class families start in the state sector even if they end up going private? We'll have to wait for more research to be sure, but I'll hazard a bet that it's the latter.</p> <p>But my support for faith schools is not unqualified, and this is where the Oasis academies are so intriguing. They do not discriminate on grounds of religious faith in staff employment or pupil admission. Chalke does not believe a school should be a holy huddle of the faithful. This radical innovation is what makes other faith schools very uneasy. The Catholic hierarchy successfully fought off quotas of non-believers recently; it is still locked in its ghetto history of tightly-knit migrant communities in hostile host societies. It has used employment discrimination and tight admissions as barricades to defend against \"dilution\" of the ethos.</p> <p>The outcome of this varies enormously across the country; in inner cities, Catholic schools absorb a disproportionate number of black African and Caribbean children - indeed, they are a vital educational resource for these groups. But in areas where the ethnic minority is Asian and Muslim, they can become a repository for white flight. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, the record of sectarianism is dismal. Given that the new admissions code places a duty on faith schools to promote community cohesion, the Catholic church needs to interrogate much more closely the role its schools play in different areas.</p> <p>However, far worse forms of segregation blight British education: the residential segregation whereby Kingston upon Thames has 7.9% of pupils eligible for free meals while Tower Hamlets has 58.8%, with concomitant differences in educational achievement, and the even more pernicious cherry-picking routinely done by independent schools - half of which, as charities, are effectively subsidised by the taxpayer. </p> <p>I don't know whether Steve Chalke and Oasis can inject a new vision into their growing network of academies, but such is their drive, commitment and self-belief that I can see why any government - led by either Brown or Cameron - would be won over. Their idealism and sincerity - Oasis youth workers volunteer to live in the community to support the school - win sceptics over because there is a desperate dearth of alternative narratives of transformation in deprived communities with low levels of educational achievement.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:m.bunting@theguardian.com\">m.bunting@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>A resolute Gordon Brown will today tell the cabinet, meeting outside London for the first time since Lloyd George's prime ministership, that he is determined to provide leadership for Britain by \"squaring up to hard truths, taking tough decisions on the economy, and being open with the British people about the choices they face\". </p> <p>In a taste of his vital speech to his party conference in Manchester in a fortnight, the prime minister is also expected to draw on his personal adversities, including his loss of sight in one eye, to argue that his own response \"to the great challenges\" of his life has been \"to confront them, resolute in the belief that there would always be something that could be done to overcome them\".</p> <p>Brown makes the rare reference to his personal life in his preface to a party strategy document that will be given to all conference delegates and be presented to cabinet members today in Birmingham before a political cabinet next week. </p> <p>Downing Street released the text yesterday, saying that it reflected Brown's recent thoughts and the tone of his conference speech. </p> <p>Aides to the prime minister also disclosed that a \u00a31bn package to help people on low incomes with spiralling energy bills (probably to be released on Thursday) may not be the government's last word, and that if the electricity companies tried to pass on the cost of the package to consumers in higher prices, a windfall tax would come back on to the government's agenda. Brown is bracing himself for criticism at this week's TUC meeting over failing to take a tougher line with the electricity firms. </p> <p>In his preface, Brown writes: \"Our country is changing. The economy, technology, our population, society, and politics, at home and abroad, are all being transformed, and these five revolutions, linked together, are taking us into a new world. Never before have so many changes taken place simultaneously in so many different spheres, so quickly, and with such potentially radical consequences.</p> <p>\"Meeting this challenge will not be easy and it will not happen overnight. There are no easy or quick answers. It requires leadership, squaring up to hard truths, being open with the British people about the choices we face, and making tough decisions on priorities for public spending.</p> <p>\"I know there are people who feel modern Britain has been unfair to them. Some of them are right. But there is nothing that is bad about Britain that cannot be overcome by what is good about Britain, as long as we keep faith with our belief in fairness.\" He also promises \"fair rules, fair chances, and a fair say for everyone: that is the new deal for this new world\".</p> <p>Ed Balls, the schools secretary, agreed that the government could not go on as it had, and denied it was a case of \"steady as she sinks\". He said: \"With the right calls and the right decisions there is no reason why the economy could not strengthen over the next year to 18 months, and I think it will.\" </p> <p>Balls is backing plans for banks to pay an insurance premium to the government in exchange for which the state would underwrite mortgage-backed assets. </p> <p>Yesterday Brown won the support of the big union leaders, with Derek Simpson, joint general secretary of Unite, saying \"we don't want a change in leader, we want a change in policy\". He infuriated some in the party by saying that, as party leader, foreign secretary David Miliband would take the party back to \"the failings of Blairism\". He added: \"We might as well elect Cameron - we might be better off with Cameron.\" He said the Blair years were \"the years in which Labour support had haemorrhaged\"; any move to return to that would be \"completely wrong\". </p> <p>Supporters of Miliband claimed privately that Unite's support for Brown stemmed from Charlie Whelan, Brown's former spin doctor and now the political director of Unite. One source described Whelan as the most powerful figure inside the Labour party - since Unite was underwriting Labour finances. </p> <p>Brown meanwhile won lukewarm support from the TUC general secretary, Brendan Barber, who said: \"We are not in an election campaign yet. We are at the equivalent of warming up in the changing room. Unfortunately, some of the government's key strikers are seriously injured and we are in urgent need of physiotherapists.\" Brown also got support from Paul Kenny, the general secretary of the GMB union. He said: \"The GMB will not be involved in any cabal or plot to replace the party leader. This is a matter entirely for MPs, and there is a proper constitutional process to do this.\"</p>",
  "<p>Five deaths, about 1,000 wrecked homes and swamped flood defences marked the latest wave of torrential storms to sweep across the country at the weekend, followed by warnings of another band of heavy weather late tomorrow. </p> <p>Lifeboat crews were sent 35 miles inland from the North Sea coast to help with hundreds of evacuations at Morpeth, Northumberland, while volunteers built sandbag walls round town centres in North Yorkshire as flash floods poured down from the North York Moors. </p> <p>Helicopters plucked several marooned families from rooftops and trees in Morpeth, where the Wansbeck reached its highest level for 40 years and turned the town into a lake. The Environment Agency said a prolonged drenching from slow-moving storm clouds gave the area a month's rain - up to 140mm - in a couple of hours. </p> <p>Filthy lines of brown sludge stretched along the High Street in Morpeth, and a similar tidemark showed how close a similar disaster had come to overwhelming the centre of Pickering, 10 miles inland from Scarborough. </p> <p>\"I had to run from the water, it came up that fast,\" said Tospy Clinch, 91, who only moved back into her cottage in Pickering in July, after a year of repairs following last summer's floods. \"We've got a system now; we have to have. My friends and neighbours had everything upstairs in 30 minutes.\" </p> <p>The water cut off her terrace all night on Saturday, but stopped feet from sandbags in front of the door yesterday morning. \"It's been a mercy this time - I was wondering what colour to choose for the sixth carpet I've had to lay here,\" she said. \"We need action. Our beck needs dredging, dredging, dredging.\" </p> <p>There were similar calls for urgency in Morpeth, where a consultation on better flood defences is not due to make recommendations until the spring.</p> <p>Jessica Leonard, 48, one of a score of people driven out of their houses in Wansbeck Place, said: \"Why isn't there any organisation? Floods aren't a new thing, so why weren't there any plans in place? We even had to buy our own sandbags.\" </p> <p>Computer models gave several hours' warning to the stricken area, as new rain gauges sent electronic signals to the Environment Agency's regional HQ that something out of the ordinary was under way. </p> <p>Asghar Akhoudi, an agency forecaster, said that buckets in the gauges were tipping and refilling in quick succession as the downpour approached, transmitting data each time. Rain levels were such that traditional fill-and-check gauges would probably have been overwhelmed. </p> <p>The storms claimed their fifth victim late yesterday, when the body of a 27-year-old technician was found beneath an avalanche of mud at a gas pipeline in the Cotswolds. Alex Wright was reported missing on Saturday when tonnes of soaked earth slid into the trench were he was working, but the whole area was too dangerous for fire and rescue crews to investigate until yesterday afternoon. </p> <p>Seven severe flood warnings remained in force last night, all in the north-east, where parts of central Durham and the commuter town of Ponteland, north of Newcastle, remained in danger along with four areas of Morpeth.</p> <p>The Met Office said scattered showers would continue today but most areas would have a respite, with spells of sunshine. Brighter weather had already returned to Pickering and Malton yesterday, with tourists watching the muddy waters of Pickering Beck and the Derwent sink back into their usual riverbeds. </p> <p>Occasional heavy downpours continued to hit eastern England between the Humber and the Scottish border. Rain caused by an Atlantic front moving in tomorrow was not expected to be anything like as severe as at the weekend, but could threaten flood defences in places where rivers are already swollen. </p> <p>The other victims of the storms were a 17-year-old girl who died when a 4x4 slid into a swollen stream in a forest in Powys, mid-Wales, a couple in Plymouth whose car hit a tree in torrential rain, and a motorcyclist from Sheffield who ploughed into a fallen tree branch on the A66 near Scotch Corner during a downpour. </p> <p>Properties evacuated as the front moved slowly north across the Midlands included a private brain injury unit in Sheffield, whose patients were transferred when water swamped the ground floor. </p> <p>Judy Evans, operations director of the British Red Cross for the north-east and Cumbria, said: \"The flood waters rose so quickly that we were not able to help with that evacuation because we couldn't get the vehicles in.\"</p> <p>The leader of Castle Morpeth council, Peter Jackson, said: \"The last major flooding in Morpeth happened in 1963 and we have extended our defences since then.\" </p> <p>But fears of what happened over the weekend prompted widespread local concern last summer, leading the Environment Agency to launch its Morpeth consultation. An agency statement last December warned that the town's defences \"need to be improved and extended to cope with today's level of flood risk and our changing climate\".</p>",
  "<p>Google, which enjoyed its 10th anniversary as a corporation yesterday, has a lot to celebrate. During that short period it has become the most interesting - and powerful - company on the planet. Its search engine, the motor for its vast advertising-generated profits, is the gateway through which most people on the internet gain access to knowledge about practically anything. From this ubiquitous base it has expanded - often by acquisition - to provide for all our web needs, including spreadsheets, email, documents, video (YouTube), blogs, calendars and news. One of its projects is scanning practically every book in the world for our perusal; it has just launched a virtual world to compete with the likes of Second Life; and in a few weeks it will release Android, its operating system for mobile phones, which could be its most important product when mobile devices become our main access to the internet.</p> <p>Last week it threw another pebble - or maybe boulder - into the pool with the release of a web browser, Chrome, to challenge Microsoft's Internet Explorer (which has more than 70% of the global market). Like other Google consumer products this was free, built with open-source methods and so available for any other browser, including Explorer, to adopt or adapt. This is not philanthropy. It is an each-way bet. If it upsets Explorer's dominance of corporate markets it will be a big victory in Google's aim of establishing an online alternative to Microsoft's 90% armlock on PC operating systems. If it does not, but makes all browsers more effective, then more people will use the web - thereby boosting Google's search-linked advertising.</p> <p>Google started off as a new kind of corporation that people could actually feel a part of. It had the motto \"Don't be evil\" - which it now seems to be playing down a bit - and a wonderful mission to make all the information in the world available to anyone. If it succeeds, the whole world will be better-educated. So far it has mainly kept to its principles, despite an ill-advised move to bow to censorship in China. But as it gets bigger, the awesome responsibility of curating the frightening amount of data it collects about us - which the FBI and MI6 can only dream about - becomes overwhelming. Even more urgently, Google's recent deal to let Yahoo adopt its contextual advertising capability means Google could command 90% of the web's contextual advertising. This is a monopoly - and potentially a very unhealthy one. Google, which won admirers through being a David against the Goliath of Microsoft, must be prevented at all costs from becoming a similar monopoly, even though it is giving its products away free.</p>",
  "<p>The three generations of the Osborne family who spent their summer holiday together last month presented a lively sight. Sir Peter Osborne, the 17th baronet in a line stretching back to the reign of Charles I in 1629, found himself with a ringside seat as his wife and heir locked horns over the issue that has divided families across the world.</p> <p>The subject of the war in Iraq disrupted the family holiday when Osborne's son, George, mounted a passionate defence of the war in the face of strong opposition from his mother.</p> <p>\"I still have rows with my mother about the Iraq war,\" Osborne says. Felicity Loxton-Peacock, noted debutante, anti-Vietnam war protester and former deli owner, feels particularly strongly on the war from her experience as an Amnesty International desk officer, he adds. \"Her area was the Kurds, dealing with the brutality of Saddam Hussein's regime - a point I make to her when we discuss the Iraq war.\" The Osborne family row shows that the man who is certain to be chancellor if David Cameron's Conservatives win the next election is cut from a different cloth from traditional grand Tories. His family are multimillionaires - his father founded the successful wallpaper firm Osborne &amp; Little - but there was no hunting, shooting and fishing, and his parents voted Labour until the arrival of Margaret Thatcher.</p> <p>\"I came from a privileged background and I went to a very good school, St Paul's,\" Osborne, 37, tells the Guardian in an interview in his Commons office overlooking the Thames. \"But it was a very cosmopolitan and metropolitan upbringing. I was brought up in the centre of London and that was my world. It's not a life of sort of landed estates. My parents' set of friends operate in the interior design world, so they are journalists, writers and art dealers.\" His metropolitan background provides an intriguing backdrop to a relationship that may well shape Britain for the next decade. </p> <p>He talks openly of how his upbringing contrasts with the landed country background of David Cameron, the son of a stockbroker who grew up in Oxfordshire. \"There are differences and we had different upbringings,\" he says.</p> <p>The contrasts between the two are being picked over by opponents who hope they will follow the example of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, whose relations slowly became poisoned. Osborne and Cameron do have disagreements; as a passionate Atlanticist, the shadow chancellor still stands by his decision to vote for the Iraq war in 2003, while the Tory leader is racked by doubts over his yes vote.</p> <p>Osborne tells the Guardian that the Tories' introduction of section 28, the law banning the promotion of homosexuality in schools, was \"antediluvian\". Cameron took some time to come round to this view and voted for its retention as late as 2003. The two also voted on opposite sides in a divisive Commons vote in May. </p> <p>Osborne voted on liberal lines on abortion and on allowing lesbian couples to have IVF treatment. Cameron voted to cut the upper limit on abortion from 24 to 20 weeks and to make IVF clinics consider the \"need for a father and a mother\" before allowing women to begin fertility treatment. \"I am a social liberal, but I do approach these issues on their merits,\" Osborne says.</p> <p>There were suggestions recently that Osborne felt uneasy about Cameron's pledge to recognise marriage in the tax system. He rejects this, saying: \"We will recognise marriage in the tax system.\"</p> <p>He adds that he considers it the best environment for raising children, but makes it clear that unmarried parents will not lose out: \"I hope a Conservative government will be able to offer things for everyone.\" Sharing the same view as Cameron on marriage, according to </p> <p>Osborne, is an example of how they agree on the \"big things\", as he rejects comparisons with Blair and Brown. </p> <p><strong>Friendship with Cameron</strong></p> <p>\"My relationship with David Cameron first of all is built on personal friendship - we are godparents to each other's children,\" he says. \"I didn't want the job [of party leader]. That is the biggest obvious difference [with Blair and Brown].\" The friendship was cemented last year when they held their nerve in the face of Gordon Brown's popularity \"bounce\" after he succeeded Tony Blair. </p> <p>Amid speculation that Cameron could be ousted if he lost a snap election, the pair planned a series of measures unveiled at the last Conservative conference. They proved so popular that Brown abandoned his election plan.</p> <p>They hope to maintain that spirit by showing the Tories offer more than catchy slogans, such as \"Vote Blue Go Green\", and that they too are prepared for the consequences of a prolonged economic downturn. Osborne jokes that he has had a personal taste of the changing economic climate. \"I have the remortgage papers on my desk,\" he says. \"The mortgage costs have gone up, not the actual mortgage.\"</p> <p>The state of the economy prompts him to sympathise with the current chancellor. \"I had some sympathy that Alistair Darling was trying to tell the truth,\" he says of the chancellor's remarks in the Guardian that Britain and the world were facing \"arguably the worst\" economic conditions in 60 years. \"Nevertheless he's the chancellor, and he needs to command public confidence in his ability to manage economic policy. \"I don't think he commands public confidence at the moment.\"</p> <p>These remarks show how Osborne plans to use the parlous state of the economy to pile pressure on the government, and to assess his economic plans with care. Describing how Britain's large budget deficit has placed a \"straitjacket\" round the economy, he says: \"One of the things we are very conscious of is that we are probably going to inherit a complete economic mess ... I think we will be shocked by the state of the books when we get there.\"</p> <p>The Tories are drawing up a new \"fiscal framework\", he says - rules governing how the government raises and spends money. If they are well received, they may answer one of the main criticisms levelled at him: that his instinct is to go for the political jugular in the short term without thinking through the political consequences.</p> <p>For example, it is widely accepted in Tory circles that Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, made a better fist of the Northern Rock crisis by campaigning for what became inevitable: its nationalisation. Osborne opposed this from the outset, so that he could portray such a move as a return by Labour to its socialist roots. </p> <p>Osborne says he accepts that the downturn has consequences for the Tories. \"That obviously forces us to think very hard about the difficult decisions we're going to have to take as an incoming government,\" he says.</p> <p>This more cautious approach is likely to prompt complaints from Tory rightwingers who want immediate tax cuts. Osborne dismisses what he has called their \"siren\" calls as he pledges to follow the path of their heroine, who took eight years to reduce the share of national income taken by the state to below the level she inherited. \"Margaret Thatcher wrestled with very difficult decisions and she was much more flexible and realistic than is sometimes portrayed,\" he says. But there will be no slashing of public spending. \"The Tory party is not there to impose impossible public expenditure cuts in an economic downturn: that's not what we believe in.\" The Conservatives now regard themselves as the greatest champions of progressive politics in Britain. Highlighting the depth of the change in their thinking, Osborne says it is right to tackle \"relative poverty\", how people's wealth relates to the average, rather than concentrating just on \"absolute poverty\", simply providing a safety net to catch the poorest.</p> <p><strong>Helping the underclass</strong></p> <p>\"I don't think it makes for a happy or strong society to know there are people so much poorer than your kind of average middle class, that there is an underclass. Whilst they may not be without food, without shelter - the classic kind of Victorian definitions of poverty - they are so lacking in opportunity and aspiration that it is a scar on society. I think the real job is to raise their opportunities and aspirations, and worry less about the hedge fund manager or the premier league footballer. That's the great challenge of our age.\"</p> <p>Osborne uses poverty to make a wider point - that he thinks the Tories are better placed to tackle issues normally associated with Labour. \"Gordon Brown thought the answer was to give people more money. We would argue the causes of poverty are much more complicated than that. It is about family breakdown, failing schools, poor healthcare, and lack of opportunity. This claim we make, that progressive goals are best achieved now by Conservative means, is something we are quite proud of.\"</p> <p>Osborne talks of one of the most important goals at the heart of the Cameron project: to speed up the Blairite process of giving the private sector, charities and voluntary groups greater involvement in delivering public services. \"You get a level of innovation that is lacking in very large public bureaucracies,\" he says. \"Sometimes in public sector organisations you're more concerned that you properly account for how money is spent, rather than whether the money is actually effective, whereas a private or voluntary sector organisation will be concerned with the outcome and the result.\"</p> <p>He believes that the Tories have the armoury to protect themselves against the sort of Brown onslaught that destroyed William Hague in 2001. Osborne should know: he was Hague's political secretary at the time. </p> <p>\"We sat in a little office, we could tell you about poll leads. At one point the government had a 40% poll lead. So I don't know what Gordon Brown is complaining about,\" he says. Labour were 15 points behind the Tories in the most recent Guardian/ICM poll. At this moment, Osborne looks at his most prized memento: a fake Newcastle Brown ale with the label \"Bottler Brown\", mocking his decision last autumn not to hold an election.</p>",
  "<p>Britain will give Bangladesh at least \u00a350m to adapt to climate change in the first big attempt by a rich nation to stave off environmental catastrophe in one of the world's poorest countries </p> <p>Other European countries such as Denmark and the Netherlands, as well as the World Bank, are expected to contribute to the new Bangladesh fund, which will be launched this week in London at a conference of the Bangladesh government and donor countries. Low-lying Bangladesh suffers from many climate-related problems, including floods, drought and river erosion, and is forecast to be devastated by climate change within 40 years. \"A 30-45cm sea-level rise will dislocate about 35 million people from coastal districts by 2050,\" Dr Atiq Rahman, Bangladeshi lead author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, will tell the British government on Wednesday. </p> <p>\"The climate is changing far more rapidly than anticipated,\" he said last week. \"Bangladesh is experiencing climate-related natural disasters and extreme events like prolonged and repeated floods which have deadly consequences on agriculture and food security.\" In the last three years, Bangladesh has faced several of its strongest cyclones and worst floods. More than 3 million people were made homeless following super-cyclone Sidr last November, when nearly 30% of the country's staple rice harvest was lost. In addition, it has been plagued with droughts and the waterlogging of vast areas of farmland. </p> <p>Bangladesh has pledged to contribute \u00a325m a year to the new fund which, it is hoped, will attract nearly \u00a3100m within three years. Other global funds for poor countries are expected to be set up in the run-up to a new Kyoto climate change agreement at the end of 2009. The Bangladesh government has calculated that it will need \u00a3250m to adapt to climate change in the next three years.</p> <p>\"We are one of the most vulnerable countries in the world. We are getting much too much water in the rainy season and too little in the dry season. All this affects how much food we can grow,\" said Bangladesh's environment minister, Raja Debashish Roy. </p> <p>The international development secretary, Douglas Alexander, said Britain and other rich countries had a moral duty to help Bangladesh and other poor countries to adapt their infrastructure, farming and economies to climate change. \"The world now has a duty to rise to the challenge and ensure that we support the poorest people of the world - least responsible for climate change - to prevent and prepare for its cruellest consequences,\" he said. </p> <p>The fund, which will be managed by British and Bangladeshi officials, will be administered by the World Bank. The money is expected to help farmers with new flood and drought-resistant crops, and with raising embankments and flood defences to protect homes.</p>",
  "<p>The rise of organic farming and rejection of GM crops in Britain and other developed countries is largely to blame for the impoverishment of Africa, according to the government's former chief scientist. </p> <p>Sir David King, who left the job at the end of last year, says anti-scientific attitudes towards modern agriculture are being exported to Africa and holding back a green revolution that could dramatically improve the continent's food supply. </p> <p>King, who is due to give the presidential address at the British Association's Festival of Science in Liverpool this evening, will criticise non-governmental organisations and the UN in his speech for backing traditional farming techniques, which he says cannot provide enough food for the continent's growing population. \"The problem is that the western world's move toward organic farming - a lifestyle choice for a community with surplus food - and against agricultural technology in general and GM in particular, has been adopted across the whole of Africa, with the exception of South Africa, with devastating consequences.\" </p> <p>Last week, King, who is now director of the Smith school of enterprise and the environment at Oxford University, said genetically modified crops could help Africa mirror the substantial increases in crop production seen in India and China. \"What was demonstrated [there] was that modern agricultural technologies can multiply crop production per hectare by factors of seven to 10.\" But traditional techniques could \"not deliver the food for the burgeoning population of Africa\".</p> <p>King said a recent report chaired by Professor Robert Watson, the government's chief scientific adviser at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, was shortsighted. The report concluded that GM crops had only a minor part to play in eradicating world hunger. The research, based on the findings of 400 scientists, noted that food was cheaper and diets better than 40 years ago, but that while enough food was produced to feed the global population, still 800 million people went hungry. </p> <p>\"You cannot argue that Africa has hunger because it doesn't have GM today,\" said Watson. \"We have more food today than ever before but it isn't getting to the right people. It's not a food production problem, it's a rural development problem.\" </p> <p>King will also call for a shift in research towards tackling climate change. More effort, he says, is needed on solar power, which could provide enough energy for the world 10,000 times over.</p>",
  "<h2>Rising costs force closure of five pubs a day</h2> <p>An average of five pubs a day are closing as publicans struggle to make a living, amid dwindling custom and rising food, fuel and labour costs. Closure rates rose by a third for the first six months compared with last year, says the British Beer and Pub Association. Other studies show beer sales, the core of the trade, are down by almost 10% on last year, hit by cheaper supermarket offers. Punch, Britain's biggest landlord, is offering leases on almost 18% of the group's 7,560 sites. But according to the association's data, more than half of the pubs shutting down were owned by individual publicans. <br><strong>Simon Bowers</strong></p> <h2>Police claim success for town's curfew zone</h2> <p>A controversial curfew keeping youngsters off the streets of a Cornish town at night finished yesterday with police claiming it had helped cut crime by 15%. Operation Goodnight, in place since July 25 to tackle antisocial behaviour around the Close Hill estate in Redruth, required children under 16 to be home by 9pm and the under-10s by 8pm. The scheme worried civil liberties campaigners but the police said that during the curfew there were 106 crimes, a fall of 15% compared with the same period last year. Mark Griffin, the officer who ran the curfew, said there had also been a fall in juvenile victims of crime. <br><strong>Steven Morris </strong></p> <h2>Man arrested after couple found dead on canal boat</h2> <p>A man has been arrested after a couple were found stabbed to death on a narrowboat on the Grand Union Canal. The bodies of a man, 53, and a woman, 39, were discovered at Stoke Hammond, near Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, early yesterday morning. The victims were said to be well known in the area. Both were pronounced dead at the scene at about 1am. The towpath was taped off as forensic science officers gathered evidence. The arrested man was being questioned by detectives at Milton Keynes police station and postmortems will be carried out today. <br><strong>Damien Francis</strong></p> <h2>DNA 'may help solve' Julie Ward murder</h2> <p>The father of a British tourist murdered on safari in Kenya 20 years ago said yesterday that he believes the crime is solvable. Julie Ward, who was 28, was last seen alive 20 years ago yesterday. She was murdered while on a trip to the Masai Mara game reserve. The case was hampered by poor investigation and led to a damning report by Jon Stoddart, now chief constable of Durham, stating that the inquiry was \"hopelessly flawed\". But her father, John Ward, believes that fresh DNA evidence and a renewed police inquiry could yield results. He said: \"This crime is imminently solvable and I believe it is.\" <br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Panel of business leaders to advise London mayor</h2> <p>London mayor Boris Johnson yesterday announced the establishment of a panel of 47 business leaders to advise him on securing the capital's position as a top global city. The International Business Advisory Council for London will be chaired by Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of advertisers WPP, and has a membership of CEOs including Willie Walsh of British Airways, Stuart Rose of Marks &amp; Spencer and Renault's Carlos Ghosn. The council, which meets for the first time on October 5, will advise the mayor on developing ideas to make London an appealing place for companies and their workers. <br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Reserved welcome for simplified train tickets</h2> <p>Passenger groups cautiously welcomed the second stage of a simpler train ticketing system which came into force yesterday. Tickets for on-the-day travel are now split into two categories, \"anytime\" and \"off-peak\". The move follows the first phase in May, when \"advanced\" tickets for single train journeys replaced a range of options. The Association of Train Operating Companies said the three new categories, together with season tickets, would account for 99% of rail tickets. Jason Torrance, of the Campaign for Better Transport, said: \"We welcome the changes but the fares still need to be reduced.\" <br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Avoid meat to curb global warming, says UN expert</h2> <p>Britons should reduce meat consumption to save the environment, a world authority on climate change said yesterday. Dr Rajendra Pachauri, chair of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, called on families to stop eating meat for at least one day a week. The UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation estimates meat production accounts for nearly a fifth of greenhouse gas emissions. \"A study from the University of Chicago showed that if Americans were to reduce meat consumption by 20% it would be as if they switched from a standard sedan to the ultra-efficient Prius,\" Pachauri said. <br><strong>Press Association</strong></p>",
  "<p>Thomas Friedman's Golden Arches theory of conflict prevention, first promulgated in 1996, made the claim that no two countries with branches of McDonald's would go to war with each other (War and McPeace, September 6). This was already disproved by 1999 when Nato bombed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (I think there were six branches of McDonald's in its capital Belgrade at the time). To be fair to Friedman, he did acknowledge this and has now replaced the original idea with a new one: the Dell theory. It stipulates: no two countries that are both part of a major global supply chain, such as Dell's, will ever fight a war against each other as long as they are both part of the same global supply chain.

  "<p>Be a bit of a pain if it did, wouldn't it? And the most frustrating thing is that we won't know for sure either way until the European laboratory for particle physics (Cern) in Geneva switches on its Large Hadron Collider the day after tomorrow.</p> <p>If you think it's unlikely that we will all be sucked into a giant black hole that will swallow the world, as German chemistry professor Otto R\u00f6ssler of the University of T\u00fcbingen posits, and so carry on with your life as normal, only to find out that it's true, you'll be a bit miffed, won't you?</p> <p>If, on the other hand, you disagree with theoretical physicist Prof Sir Chris Llewellyn Smith of the UK Atomic Energy Agency, who argues that fears of possible global self-ingestion have been exaggerated, and decide to live the next two days as if they were your last, and then nothing whatsoever happens, you'd feel a bit of a fool too.</p> <p>R\u00f6ssler apparently thinks it \"quite plausible\" that the \"mini black holes\" the Cern atom-smasher creates \"will survive and grow exponentially and eat the planet from the inside\". So convinced is he that he has lodged an EU court lawsuit alleging that the project violates the right to life guaranteed under the European Convention of Human Rights.</p> <p>Prof Llewellyn Smith, however, has assured Radio 4's Today programme that the LHC - designed to help solve fundamental questions about the structure of matter and, hopefully, arrive at a \"theory of everything\" - is completely safe and will not be doing anything that has not happened \"100,000 times over\" in nature since the earth has existed. \"The chances of us producing a black hole are minuscule,\" he said, \"and even if we do, it can't swallow up the earth.\" So, folks, who do you believe?</p>",
  "<p>When I was 19, I moved to the US to work at the New York Botanical Garden. I had never lived in a city before, having grown up in Hampshire surrounded by farms, woods and wild places. I was at once entranced and terrified. After what, at the time, I considered a dull country upbringing, the city pulsed with excitement. Yet I could not quite accept that I would not have a green place of my own there. One day I was looking out onto endless fields; the next I was living in a place where having anything other than a brick wall outside your window seemed to be a luxury. </p> <p>I really searched that city for somewhere to live. I was offered rooms with no natural light, rooms in basements, and one rather odd division of some starving actor's pad where the owner partitioned the room by hanging up a sheet. I remember getting excited that one place had a deep window ledge. </p> <p>When I had almost given up, I wandered into a neighbourhood where every second block seemed to be a garden. I didn't really know where I was, but I knew I had to stay. I rented a room from a friendly hippy with a top-floor view over all these lovely gardens. One of them was to become my home for that year. I had found a community that was making beautiful gardens literally from the street. The paths, the compost, the arbours, every inch was judiciously recycled from other people's waste. The only money these East Side gardens received was from yard sales and the odd grant to fund a fence to keep them safe. </p> <p>I have spent many years in formal training as a horticulturalist, at the Royal Horticultural Society and Kew, as well as the New York Botanical Garden. Yet that period at the East Side gardens was at least as influential. I fell in love with the ethic, thrift and spirit that thrive in such settings. And I learned how to \"scrap craft\" with great effect. </p> <p>Scrap craft is when you reuse or recycle unwanted items into something useful. It starts with \"I wonder if I ... \" and ends with all sorts of cool stuff for the garden. Floorboards turn into compost bins, a chest of drawers becomes your new container garden and someone's unwanted furniture your new patio table. I have lost count of the lidless plastic storage boxes I have seen in skips. Grab one, drill some holes in the bottom, fill it with compost and you have a perfect container in which to grow lettuce or radishes. I am not suggesting that a storage box is an attractive option, but I guarantee that once it is full of lettuce you won't be looking at the container. If you are really offended by the box, keep an eye out for an old bamboo blind - they are also forever being chucked into skips. With a little snipping you can wrap your box, sow some spicy greens and suddenly have a stylish container with a nod to Japan. </p> <p>Buckets, tubs and food containers can also all be used. I have a lovely old tin bath in which I grew my tomatoes this year and it is now housing my kale for the winter. Even hard landscaping doesn't need to be expensive: the most beautiful path I know is in that community garden in New York. Its intricate design is made up from fragments of the bricks found in the soil, testament that something as unpromising as rubble can still become part of a beautiful feature. </p> <p>Gardening is increasingly becoming something you buy, rather than something you do, yet there is nothing more satisfying than being able to say, \"I made that. \" You start to surround yourself with stuff that suits your home and the way you live and instead of the impersonal elegance or, worse still, mass ugliness of manufactured things, you get something that has a little bit of the spirit and personality of its maker. </p> <p>As I learned in New York, plants themselves can be free. I am now very good at doing a little judicious harvesting from front gardens as I walk to the supermarket. A seed head here or there has meant my garden has a growing opium poppy and verbena population. I am one for pretty weeds such as Welsh poppies, nettle-leaved bellflowers and hawkbits, and have carefully collected seed from the wilder, more neglected bits of my neighbourhood and sprinkled them around my garden. By maintaining the local population of wildflowers, I'm doing my bit for the wider environment too. </p> <p>If you keep your eyes peeled, you will even find adult plants. I have two lovely little cacti that I found last year discarded in a skip. With new pots and some fresh soil, they have grown well. I can't tell you what a kick I get every time I see them. </p> <p>Many of the community gardens that inspired me have now been lost to gentrification, but those that remain demonstrate that you don't need money to make a beautiful garden. That is the lesson to remember: whatever you end up creating and growing, find your own way of doing it, and enjoy the process. These days my working life is spent in Gardeners' World's beautiful garden near Stratford-upon-Avon, but my biggest pleasure is still coming home to my city garden and picking a salad from a wine crate full of compost I made from my kitchen waste. </p> <p>Here are some easy ways to become a more thrifty gardener.</p> <h2>Think outside the pot </h2> <p>It is hard to make a jumble of plastic pots look stylish, but there are all sorts of other things you can use to grow plants in. It is best to be either restrained and minimalist or eccentrically eclectic: you could use just one type of container or go for everything and anything that will house a plant, as long as you have flair and a good eye - no old boots or loo basins! </p> <p>Wooden wine boxes, with their lovely embossed logos, are great for growing salad crops in. The best place to get them from is a high-end wine merchants as the better the wine, the better the quality of box. Portuguese port boxes are usually really well made. It is a good idea to add corner braces to stop the wood from warping. You also need to drill holes in the base for drainage. Radishes, cut-and-come-again lettuces, spring onions, Oriental greens, tomatoes and herbs will all grow happily in boxes. </p> <p>Old drawers are another good resource. These tend to be made from very good wood, with lovely dovetailed joints. You will need to weatherproof them and create drainage holes; you should also line the drawers with plastic because they were never meant to be used outside, and brace the corners. Big drawers of around 20-30cm deep are the best find as you can grow roots such as beetroot, turnips, swedes or an entire salad crop in one box. </p> <p>A word about skip etiquette, as this is where you can find many of your raw materials. It is a fact that people are throwing stuff out and therefore don't want it, but they still have legal rights to it. So always ask permission before you raid a skip, for two reasons: it is polite and it keeps you on the right side of the law. Also, once people know what you are up to, they may even save you stuff. If you can't find anyone to ask permission from, leave a note. I've found it works wonders just to leave a note asking: \"Is this wood being thrown out and can I have it? Tick Yes or No.\" Some people swear by taking things from skips only at night or in the early morning, mainly because they are less likely to run into anyone, but I reckon this looks suspicious. I dive in at any time of day, I always leave the skip tidier than when I found it and I have yet to get into trouble.</p> <p>All wooden containers need preserving. Oil waterproofs the wood while still allowing it to breathe, so if the wood gets wet it can dry out. I use Danish oil, which is a blend of various oils that dry to form a hard surface. You will need at least three coats and it is not worth cutting corners because the more layers you treat it with, the longer the wood will last. A cheaper option is boiled linseed oil, but this takes more than a week to dry properly and can have a sticky finish - I have found that it works well on wine boxes, as this wood is so dry that it just sucks it in, but it is no good on pre-treated wood. </p> <p>Don't be tempted to varnish your boxes, as this will only result in more work. Varnish creates an impervious layer that physically keeps water out, but if there is any sort of crack then water gets in but can't get out, and the wood rots from the inside. </p> <p>Large food tins also make brilliant growing containers. Among my favourites are the big square ones that contained bulk-cured olives and have lovely designs on the front. You may be able to get hold of them from a market stall that sells Italian or Greek delicacies. Or try asking restaurants for ghee or oil tins. You will have to cut the top off them and, inevitably, they will rust, but that can be a good look. For the best drainage, drill holes around the sides near the bottom, rather than through the base. </p> <p>Potatoes grow so easily in containers that I have almost given up growing them in the ground. I bought five very large pots (the size of dustbins, themselves another alternative) from a pound store a couple of years ago and grow a summer supply with virtually no effort. Spuds will grow equally as well in old compost or mulch bags. These can be disguised with hessian sacks. Some of the nicest are seed potato bags, so ask your garden centre if it has any when you buy your potatoes in spring. Another source of sacks are pet stores, which may get bulk supplies of peanuts in them. </p> <p>As for plastic bags, you can grow almost anything in them, as long as they are not see-through (because roots don't like light). I have seen vegetables and flowering plants successfully grown in supermarket carriers. It may not be attractive, but if you know that you are only renting a flat for six months or so and don't want the hassle of transporting pots, it is one way to have a garden. </p> <h2>Grow your own compost</h2> <p>There are two myths that seem to stop people becoming master composters. Myth number one is that compost smells bad. This is emphatically not true. Good compost smells rich and healthy. Myth number two is that good compost takes years to make. Rubbish. Good compost can be made in around four months in the summer; over the winter it will take up to twice that long. </p> <p>Making compost is just like baking a cake or making bread. You have to put in the right ingredients and mix them together in vaguely the right amounts. If you put only grass clippings in your pile, it won't rot down for a very long time but will just turn into a slimy green mess. If all you try to compost are great chunks of branches or roots, these will take years to rot down. The key is to create a balance between the brown stuff you put in, and the green stuff - otherwise known as the carbon/nitrogen ratio. You should have about two-thirds brown stuff (carbon source) to one-third green (nitrogen). Brown broadly represents carbon found in fibrous material such as twigs and stems, straw, cardboard and roots, as well as old cotton and woollen clothes. Green refers to nitrogen found in plant leaves, stems, grass, flowers and weeds. </p> <p>The other thing you need to remember is to separate the annual weeds from the perennials. Fragments of root from perennials such as bindweed, mare's tail, docks, thistles, yellow-rooted nettles and couch grass will survive even the hottest compost, so you can't put them on your heap as soon as you have pulled them from the ground. Instead, soak them in a bucket of water with a lid (excluding light makes them decompose quicker). When it has turned into a slimy mass, put this onto the compost as a nutrient-rich soup.</p> <p>So: chop up your branches, throw on all your vegetable scraps and annual weeds, add a few thin layers of grass clippings (never more than 15cm/6in deep). Hurl on a pizza box, rip up your old jeans, add some plant prunings, and mix. That's all there is to it. You will end up with a delicious rich dark crumbly cake. All you have to do is spread this across the top of your garden and the worms will dig it in for you. The sum total of your expenditure will have been to walk to your compost bin a few times a week with vegetable scraps, to turn your compost once or twice and then to spread it. </p> <p>Why will a bin help? Compost ingredients are chiefly broken down by aerobic bacteria. To do this quickly and efficiently, they need plenty of air and moisture. The faster the bacteria work, the hotter the conditions get. Cooking the compost is fairly essential as it kills off weed seeds, pathogens and plant diseases. A large compost heap, anything a metre wide or more, will easily reach 60-70C in a matter of hours. A small pile will bake much more gently and perhaps never reach quite the same temperature. However, you can help the bacteria by having some sort of container for your compost, to insulate the pile and provide the right conditions for the \"bacterial bonfire\". </p> <p>Think of building your compost a little like a bonfire. Air needs to be drawn from the bottom up through the centre of the heap to get the fire going. One way to do this, particularly if your bin is plastic, is to lay several bricks on their edges at the bottom of the bin. This creates a layer on which the compost will sit, drawing air from below. It's always a good idea to have a lid for your bin to keep the rain out and the heat in, but make sure that it lets air through. If it's a plastic lid, make some small holes in it to draw air out. </p> <p>Compost also needs moisture. If it is too dry, the compost will virtually stand still, but if it is too wet, especially if this is coupled with too little air, you will get anaerobic conditions and the pile will start to produce methane. This is a big no-no, since the planet doesn't need any more. If you use a plastic bin, you will have to be especially careful not to create these conditions or you will get a slimy, rotting, very smelly mess. </p> <p>If you get into composting in a big way, you don't have to be limited by your own biodegradable waste. You can find lots of places to get waste for free - people will even be pleased for you to take it away. Most coffee shops have loads of used grounds that they chuck away - these are perfect compost material. Pet shops that sell birds have lots of droppings and nothing to do with them (but steer clear of cat and dog poo). Local pubs and restaurants will have vegetable scraps, and work canteens will be pleased for you to take home their used teabags. You may have to provide containers and promise regular collection, but it's worth it. </p> <h2>Use your windowsills</h2> <p>If you only have a very narrow, sunbaked windowsill and little inclination to water all the time, but you still want to look out on flowers, the lowest-maintenance display of all comes from shallow-rooting sedums or sempervivums (houseleeks). These are mountainous plants adapted to grow in very shallow, very poor soil, under extreme conditions from searing heat to bitter cold. They are usually to be found in the alpine section of the garden centre. </p> <p>The easiest way is to grow them in engineering bricks - the kind with holes in them. Gather together enough bricks to fill your sill and pack half of each hole with a mix of two parts good multipurpose compost to one part grit or vermiculite. This is a bit fiddly as the compost will want to fall out, so pack it in as tight as you can. Break a rooted rosette large enough to fill the rest of each hole from each plant, and gently push each one into the compost. Sit each brick in a tray of water until the compost is fully saturated, then put them on your windowsill. If there is any danger of them tumbling off, you should secure wire through the holes before you start and use this to tie the bricks on to a hook attached to the side of the window frame.</p> <p>Eventually the rosettes will smother the bricks and the plants will thrive in this inhospitable environment because the bricks are porous and will absorb and release just the right amount of water. In the hottest weather, you can slosh some water over them to help out. You will have to do a little maintenance every now and then: pick off some dead rosettes and flower stalks, maybe give them a foliage feed once in a while. But that's it, and I bet the bees will visit your windowsill. </p> <h2>Plant your pips </h2> <p>The range of houseplants from garden centres or DIY stores can be a little boring, majoring on palms, cacti and ferns. I wanted something cheap and something that was to hand in whichever city I was living in. I found it in the stuff that usually gets thrown out. </p> <p>I started with the obvious - the avocado seed. I love its kitsch 70s appeal; think of Mary Ann Singleton in Tales of the City sprouting her lunchtime avocado at her office desk. It is a great houseplant as it doesn't mind a fair amount of neglect and rewards any love with a full flush of growth. Most people know the avocado stone, toothpicks and jar of water trick from childhood. It is a bit hit-and-miss, but with patience most do sprout. There are other ways. I found in a very neglectful moment that if you just leave the whole stone covered in water in a bowl, it will sprout. Once it has sprouted, you can convert to the toothpick and jar method. You can also get avocados to sprout super-quickly in a worm bin, and fairly quickly in a compost bin, but it is hard to find them once you have put them in. As soon as the stone has sprouted roots and a shoot, transplant it into a 20cm (8in) pot.</p> <p>What about the rest of the fruit bowl and vegetable rack?</p> <p>There are a few considerations to grocery gardening. Many modern fruits and vegetables have inhibitors to stop them germinating in storage - this is particularly true of potatoes - and it is best to go for organic produce where possible. Some stuff just doesn't have any seed to germinate - clearly you will never get a banana seed. And some produce will be hybrid varieties, so you might not get what you expect. </p> <p>A general rule for germinating from fruit is that the riper it is, the better - even rotten - as these seeds have had time to mature. If your mango or avocado was hard, the seed probably won't be ready. If you work with the seasons, you always get better results, so start sprouting seeds in late spring and early summer and you will have enough light to get things going. </p> <p>Papaya is easy to germinate and plants grow fast. Clean the seeds and germinate them in two-thirds compost mixed with one-third grit or vermiculite, sowing about 1.5cm (\u00bdin) deep. Water the compost liberally but don't completely saturate it, cover the pot with a plastic bag and leave it on a sunny windowsill. In warm, bright conditions, seedlings are quick to sprout. Remove the bag once seedlings have popped up, and water frequently without drowning them. Repot into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle. Mature plants need a bright location and regular watering. If they don't get enough water, they will drop their leaves all at once; shortly afterwards they will droop and die. </p> <p>Papayas are not for the neglectful gardener, but if you love them, they will grow as big as you let them. </p> <p>Mango seed is best harvested from almost rotting fruit. Clean all the stringy bits and pulp from the seed and leave it overnight to dry. With a sharp knife, cut carefully down one side of the seed and take out the bean. Sow it flat, 2.5cm (1in) deep, and cover the pot with a plastic bag. Remove the plastic bag only when the seedling is up and standing strong, about 5cm (2in) tall. Mangoes like moist, fertile soil and sunny conditions. A regular liquid feed does them good. </p> <p>Limes, lemons, oranges and grapefruit can all be grown from seed and make lovely houseplants, though they will rarely fruit indoors. Choose ripe or even slightly overripe fruit and sow fresh seed in the summer in pots filled with two-thirds multipurpose compost and one-third grit. Make sure there is a good layer of grit at the bottom for extra drainage and cover the pot with another 5mm (\u00bcin) layer of grit. Don't allow your seedlings to dry out and weed out any puny ones. Once a few are well established, you can knock them out of the pot, carefully transplanting each one into a 9cm (3\u00bdin) pot to start with. I'm afraid your plants won't flower until they are at least seven years old, but the glossy leaves smell lovely and they are handsome plants. </p> <p>Pomegranates can also be successfully sown, provided that you first let the seed dry out for a few days by spreading it on a kitchen towel. Then carefully clean any off residue and sow the seed 1.5cm (\u00bdin) deep in good, moist potting compost and cover the pot with a plastic bag. Keep it on a sunny windowsill and be patient; the seed takes up to two months to germinate before you can de-bag the pot. Don't let the compost dry out and, when seedlings appear, keep them moist. The best time to germinate seed is late spring and early summer so pomegranates can benefit from time outside in hot summers. </p> <h2>Eat up your weeds </h2> <p>They used to be part of people's diets, but we now have so much choice that we rarely fill our plates with weeds. Eating them into submission is very satisfying. Chickweed is good in salads, not unlike winter purslane. It has a fresh, green taste and can also be used in soups, but you have to pick a whole heap. Ground elder was a Roman treat as it was around even in winter. You eat it a bit like spinach, picking only the young leaves and gradually exhausting the plant. Fat hen is a medieval herb used, unsurprisingly, to fatten hens. It is a big, thirsty annual that looks a bit like dock but tastes good enough in salads or stemmed like spinach. </p> <p>Stinging nettles are packed full of vitamin C and young leaves make a delicious spring soup. Young dandelion leaves are very good for indigestion - slightly bitter, but a good addition to salads and very tasty sauteed. Japanese knotweed is enough to make most gardeners weep, but sauteeing, steaming or simmering the young shoots is one sort of revenge. They have a slightly tart taste that is like either asparagus or rhubarb, depending on whom you speak to. Choose young shoots 15-20cm (6in-8in) long, and discard any leaves, as these are too tough. </p> <h2>Kill it with Coke</h2> <p>Gardeners have made their own weed controls for generations, but home-made herbicides and pesticides are illegal under current EU legislation. They are included here only for non-EU gardeners. </p> <p>The most effective home-made weedkiller is a mixture of four cups of vinegar to half a cup of salt and a couple of teaspoons of washing-up liquid. When the salt is fully dissolved, just spray or wipe it on to broad-leaved weeds such as docks and ground elder. Unfortunately, it is lethal to all other plants around it as well. It works best in sunny conditions. Coca-Cola is surprisingly good for killing off weeds in pavement cracks. It is a bit sticky, but very effective if used on a sunny day. </p> <p>You and your hoe are the best and cheapest weedkillers out there, however. If you are out hoeing the tops off annual plants first thing in the morning, the weeds will burn off in the sun. Nothing is more effective. Hoe in dry weather so weeds don't get the chance to regenerate. </p> <h2>Brew your own fertiliser </h2> <p>Some plants are so packed with energy and nutrients that they can be used to feed others. Even if you have to buy comfrey plants to start with, once they are established you may never need to buy commercially made plant food. Nettles, though not quite so powerful, are free.</p> <p>Comfrey is a deep-rooted, hardy perennial that is found throughout Europe. Its leaves are high in potash, a source of potassium important for cell division, and also have good levels of nitrogen and phosphate. Three forms of comfrey make good all-round fertilisers. Common wild forms Symphytum officinale and Symphytum asperum are useful as leaves for compost or for tea. \"Bocking 14\" is a cultivar of Russian comfrey (Symphytum x uplandicum). Comfrey can also be put on the compost to act as an activator and speed up the composting process. I tend to grow a clump next to my compost for this reason. </p> <p>Symphytum officinale and Sasperum both seed freely. If you know someone with a plant, ask them for a division or for some seed to sow in autumn. \"Bocking 14\" is sterile, so you have to take root cuttings. </p> <p>Comfrey tea is made from steeped leaves, and can be used as a general-purpose fertiliser or pick-me-up. On newly established plants, harvest only half the leaves and send any flowering stalks to the compost bin. Otherwise, harvest by cutting the leaves right down to the ground. Established plants can be harvested up to four times a year. Stuff as many fresh or wilted leaves as possible into a container with a tightly fitting lid and fill it with water. Exact quantities are not too important. Weigh the lid down with bricks and after 10 days or so your brew will start to ferment. You will know it is doing well when you can barely get near the container, as comfrey stinks when it is rotting - that's where the tight-fitting lid comes in. </p> <p>I almost relish the stench now because I know that what most offends my nose will please the plants. As a rule, however, I never use comfrey on houseplants. It just smells too much indoors. </p> <p>Nettles also make an effective tea. Young spring plants make the strongest concoction; as with comfrey, when it really starts to smell you'll know it's ready.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Adapted from <strong>The Thrifty Gardener: How to Create a Stylish Garden for Next to Nothing </strong>by Alys Fowler, to be published by Kyle Cathie on September 25 at \u00a316.99.

  "<p>Manchester City's billionaire new owners are planning an extraordinary vision for the future that will see the club branch into financial services, the fashion industry, telecommunications and even bring out a range of Citycars. The aim is to become \"the Virgin of Asia and the world\" with a major re-branding that will involve, among other things, City 24-7 energy drinks, branded Mini Coopers, official club scooters, telephone cards and a chain of City Eating fast-food stores.</p> <p>The proposals demonstrate the ambition of the Abu Dhabi United Group and their unshakeable belief that they have the financial clout to see City catch, then overhaul, Manchester United as the world's most popular club, first on the pitch and then in terms of commercial income.</p> <p>How City plan to do this is revealed in an 83-page blueprint, A New Model for Partnership in Football, which was influential in convincing the Abu Dhabi royal family to buy the club from the previous owner Thaksin Shinawatra. It is understood the document was put together by the ultra-ambitious Garry Cook, a former Nike executive who was recruited by Thaksin earlier in the summer and whose vision of football involves a Premier League structure with 10to 14 clubs and, most controversially, no promotion or relegation.</p> <p>Cook's determination to \"think global\" can be gauged by his recent statement that City's behind-the-scenes operation had been \"a shock\" to him when he joined the club as executive chairman, explaining: \"You look at our brand and it's Thomas Cook. But there's something not quite right about watching us in a bar in Beijing or Bangkok or Tokyo and seeing 'Fred Smith's Plumbing, call 0161...'\" He also stated that the Premier League was \"10 years behind\" the US in merchandising terms. Manchester United, he said, had \"not even scratched the surface\".</p> <p>His plans for City include a partnership with Red Bull to bring out drinks called City Powered, City Energy and City 24/7. There are plans to open designer clothing stores and tap into the Indian market, via the Tata Motors Group, by bringing out a range of cars and other vehicles, as well as branded motorcycle helmets. A deal is being discussed with China Mobile to sell City-branded phone cards and Ricky Hatton has been identified to help City Training fitness schemes.</p> <p>At the same time, City genuinely believe enough money will be ploughed into the club to win the Premier League within two or three seasons and, thereafter, be in contention for the Champions League. However, the men in power at Eastlands are also finding out that the rest of the football world is still viewing the new, super-wealthy City through sceptical eyes.</p> <p>One confirmed target, Cesc Fabregas, has described the idea of joining City as being \"suicidal\" for his career, while another, Klaas Jan Huntelaar, has talked of a \"second-rate club\" wanting to make him \"very rich\" on transfer deadline day.</p> <p>Dr Sulaiman Al-Fahim, the billionaire businessman behind the takeover, said last week that City would bid \u00a3135m for Cristiano Ronaldo but the reaction at Old Trafford has been more of bemusement than concern. David Gill, United's chief executive, said: \"I think we will treat it with a pinch of salt.\"</p>",
  "<p>Lewis Hamilton continues to lead the drivers' world championship but his advantage was slashed from eight points to two after a controversial decision by the race stewards at Spa-Francorchamps last night. The Englishman appeared to have won the Belgian grand prix at the end of a tense race-long duel with Finland's Kimi Raikkonen but he was later judged to have gained an unfair advantage as his McLaren-Mercedes and the Ferrari came close to colliding at the start of the penultimate lap.</p> <p>Raikkonen later spun off, leaving Hamilton to finish 14 seconds ahead of his closest championship rival, Brazil's Felipe Massa, and a further seven seconds in front of Nick Heidfeld's BMW. But a 25-second penalty dropped Hamilton to third place, a decision McLaren have appealed against.</p> <p>The weekend until then had been too good to be true. After the poisonous atmosphere at Spa 12 months ago when motor sport's governing body, the FIA, had fined McLaren \u00a350m for their part in a spy scandal involving Ferrari technical information, this year's event had been epitomised by the sheer drama of the racing as Spa, the longest circuit in formula one, delivered its traditional spectacle. The captivating action would last for an hour and 23 minutes as Hamilton took what appeared to be his fifth win of the season in superb style. Then the FIA stewards stepped in.</p> <p>There had been action from the start as Hamilton took advantage of pole position and led through the first corner, a tight hairpin where, as has become a habit at Spa, several cars either collided or had near misses. The track, difficult at the best of times, was made even more treacherous by the remnants of a light sprinkling of rain which had left the circuit damp in places but not bad enough to warrant wet-weather tyres. </p> <p>Massa, holding second place, was more careful than most as the field swept into the dip at Eau Rouge and began the long climb to the top of the circuit. Seeing his team-mate's caution, Raikkonen seized his chance as the Ferraris ran side by side at 180mph, the Finn then easing Massa towards the grass, much to the Brazilian's surprise.</p> <p>\"I made a mistake by thinking Eau Rouge was wetter than it was,\" said Massa. \"Kimi then passed me on the hill. He was going to pass me anyway. For some reason he closed the line [cut across]. I don't know why he did that.\"</p> <p>Raikkonen set off after Hamilton and then found himself in the lead when the McLaren driver locked his brakes at the end of the lap and spun. Hamilton was fortunate to recover and lose only one place. \"That mistake was quite costly,\" he said. \"It put us on the back foot. We switched to a shorter middle stint in the race. I rejoined in traffic and used a lot of the life of that set of tyres early on. But, after the second [and final] stop, it was really good. I took a chunk out of Raikkonen's lead. I was really going for it.\"</p> <p>The next 15 laps of the race were mesmerising as Raikkonen and Hamilton, separated by no more than five seconds, traded fastest laps.</p> <p>\"I was on every limit, and even beyond,\" said Hamilton. \"I was pushing as hard as I could but I couldn't get too close without the handling of my car being upset behind the Ferrari. It was one of the most exciting races for a long time - and I wanted it to rain. I was praying: 'Rain, rain, rain.' I wanted the rain to come. Just a few droplets would make it a little bit easier for me and then we could have a good battle towards the end. That's exactly what happened.\"</p> <p>When a light shower arrived with three laps to go, Hamilton closed on Raikkonen and made a try for the lead as they arrived side by side at the chicane. \"I had nowhere to go,\" said Hamilton. \"So, rather than hit Kimi and maybe take us both out, I went on to the escape road and rejoined in front of him. The team told me straight away that I had to let him back in front - and that's what I did.</p> <p>\"My heart was racing more than it ever has before,\" he added. \"I am a racing driver. This is what I do best - you race down to the last minute. You don't turn the engine down and back off and just take the points in that situation.\"</p> <p>The stewards later decided that Hamilton had not backed off enough as the Ferrari went past. Hamilton's attempt to dive inside under braking for the next corner was blocked by Raikkonen, Hamilton then running round the outside and taking the lead, Raikkonen hitting the back of the McLaren as he did so.</p> <p>The drama was not yet over on the track. Halfway round the next lap, the leaders came across the spinning Williams of Nico Rosberg and almost hit the German. Hamilton took to the grass and Raikkonen retook the lead - only to spin not long afterwards. Hamilton was back in front again and Raikkonen then spun off for good a few corners later.</p> <p>\"The final lap was so slippery,\" said Hamilton. \"I had no temperature in the tyres after driving in the wet for a lap and half. I was braking very, very early and still arriving at each corner knowing the car could step out of line and there would be nothing I could do about it. You have to turn on your senses to full power and react as best you can to any moment you may have. I was looking in the mirrors and saw Felipe was going even slower.

  "<p>Britain's dire public finances will impose a \"straitjacket\" on an incoming Conservative government for years to come, the shadow chancellor, George Osborne, claims today, as he declares that he is conducting a careful review of his economic plans in the light of the downturn.</p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian, Osborne claims that \"the complete economic mess\" will \"cast a long shadow\" over British politics, prompting the Tories to think \"very hard\" about what they will do in government.</p> <p>Osborne, the key figure behind the rebranding of the Tories with David Cameron, signals the scale of Conservative ambitions by indicating that he wants to follow Tony Blair in building a big tent across party lines. Reaching out to senior supporters of the former prime minister, he announces that the Tories will support the work and pension secretary, James Purnell, as he seeks to increase the private sector role in welfare services. The Tories would also welcome Lord Adonis, father of city academies, as a minister.</p> <p>But Osborne makes clear the Tories have many hurdles to clear before they can turn their 15-point poll lead into a general election win. The next big step will come at the Conservative conference later this month when he unveils a blueprint for the changed economic circumstances this autumn. This will include:</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> A shakeup of tax and spending rules by creating a new \"fiscal framework\" to govern how a Tory government raises and spends money. The new rules, to be judged by an independent panel, will overhaul the way that multibillion pound public finance initiative schemes and other public sector liabilities are measured. Osborne believes Gordon Brown has used PFI to \"get money off the balance sheet\", and to shield high borrowing: \"Very bad deals were struck which I think will cost the taxpayer for many, many years to come.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Adapting to a changed economic climate, where people are more hostile to green taxes at the heart of the Tory policy on the environment. Support for them has been hit by the row over rises in car tax. \"I think green taxes are a very powerful tool in tackling climate change ... [but the] case is made much more difficult by Gordon Brown and Labour because they have used them as stealth taxes, by which I mean they don't replace some other tax.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Implementing the party's central economic goal - to trigger a gradual slowing of public spending by sharing the proceeds of economic growth between tax cuts and spending increases. Osborne refuses to say whether he would match Labour's spending plans for the next round, up until 2014, but adds: \"The Tory party is not there to impose impossible public expenditure cuts in an economic downturn.\"</p> <p>Osborne says the changes are an illustration of the \"tough decisions\" he will have to take as chancellor. \"I think [the public finances] are going to cast a long shadow over British politics for the coming years because they are clearly deteriorating very fast. The large budget deficit is the straitjacket on British politics at the moment ... One of the things we are very conscious of is that we are probably going to inherit a complete economic mess. That obviously forces us to think very hard about the difficult decisions we're going to have to take as an incoming government.\"</p> <p>The shadow chancellor speaks to the Guardian at the start of a three-day series looking at the new Tories. This will examine the key figures behind the decontamination of the Conservative brand, which has given David Cameron a 15-point poll lead, and his depiction of the Tories as the \"true champions for progressive ideals\". </p> <p>Amid increasing confidence in the Tory ranks, Osborne launches a raid on Labour territory by appealing to trade union members on the eve of the TUC conference to recognise that the modern Tory party is the new home for social reform. But his plans for changing the way the economy is run shows the depth of Tory ambitions. </p> <p>He calls for an overhaul of Britain's fiscal system after Brown \"busted\" his two rules - the \"golden rule\", which says the government can only borrow to invest over an economic cycle, and the sustainable investment rule which says debt must be no more than 40% of national income. He adds that he expects to be shocked by the state of the books if he makes it to the Treasury. \"Gordon Brown as chancellor was very adept at micro-manipulation of the red book and the debt figures and the borrowing figures. The cumulative impact of that over the years is that I don't think anyone has a clear idea of what the true state of the national debt is, or what the true state of the structural deficit.\"</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown is right. That's a four-word sentence you don't often hear these days, but the prime minister was correct when he said in Glasgow last week that Britain is being dragged down by what he called \"the first great financial crisis of the global age\". This is not a uniquely UK problem as was the case with most of the economic emergencies in the second half of the 20th century.</p> <p>The prime minister also has a case when he says that Britain is better placed to weather the global economic storm than it was in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, although not for the reasons he states. In many respects, the structural defects of the economy are more glaring than they have ever been. Britain's balance of trade has sunk deeper and deeper into the red over the past decade as consumption has outstripped production. The manufacturing sector has shed more than a million jobs. The strong growth in the economy in the years running up to the credit crunch was largely the result of large inflows of capital necessary to fund the trade deficit creating two linked bubbles in housing and financial services.</p> <p>The reason Britain may be better placed than other countries to cope with the downturn is nothing to do with the supposed improvement in productivity (illusory) or the strength of the competition regime (a prime ministerial boast that rings hollow in the light of the oligopolistic behaviour of the domestic energy sector). Rather, it has more to do with the freedom of the Bank of England to set appropriate interest rates, and for the pound to find its own level on the foreign exchanges. </p> <p>The British pro-euro faction has recently started to rediscover its voice, having been silent since Brown said in 2003 that the five tests for monetary union had not been passed. But its argument that Britain would now be better off inside the eurozone is fatuous, and not just because the bigger economies of monetary union - Germany, France and Italy - started to contract even before Britain did. During the boom years, the UK would have had inappropriately low interest rates, which would have led to an even bigger housing bubble and an even bigger current account deficit. Britain would have been Spain with knobs on. During the bust, Britain would have found itself not only like post-bubble Spain but also like Italy, which suffers from a severe lack of competitiveness but has only one tool - a squeeze on wages - to deal with it.</p> <p>In the spirit of fairness, it has to be admitted that the policy freedom enjoyed by the UK is more theoretical than real. Labour's pro-speculator and anti-industry bias has left the country far less capable of exploiting the benefits of a lower pound than ought to be the case. What's more the freedom of the Bank of England to set interest rates at the level that is right for Britain is relevant only if the monetary policy committee uses that freedom rather than behaving like a branch of the European Central Bank. </p> <p>The need for policy makers to get macro-economic conditions right was the theme of last week's annual report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad). Although concentrating primarily on emerging and developing economies, the findings of the study are also relevant for countries such as Britain. </p> <p><strong>Classical theory </strong></p> <p>The Unctad report seeks to explain an apparent paradox, namely that capital has been flowing from developing countries to developed countries whereas classical economic theory says it should be the other way round. According to the textbook model of the world, rich countries export their capital to poor countries to foster faster growth. But for the past 10 years, countries such as China have been exporting capital to the US and Britain so that we can live beyond our means.</p> <p>Heiner Flassbeck, the editor of the report, says the big change occurred at the time of the Asian crisis in 1997-98. Countries such as South Korea and Thailand found that they were vulnerable to massive inflows and outflows of hot money and were determined that there should be no repetition. As a result, they locked in the benefits of the devaluation forced upon them by capital flight by intervention in the currency markets and by keeping the lid on the cost of borrowing to consumers and businesses. In China, direct intervention by the government has ensured that market interest rates in east Asia - the price of money for the customers of commercial banks rather than the policy rate set by central banks - are kept low.</p> <p>Rising exports generated profits for companies in the developing countries and these surpluses were then available for re-investment. China and the other emerging economies have had stronger growth and higher investment ratios than the countries receiving their capital and are clearly comfortable with this model than the old Washington consensus one, which focused on foreign direct investment and financial deregulation to generate the savings for investment.</p> <p>As Unctad points out, the new Asian model is catching on in other parts of the world as well. Latin America provides a contrast between Argentina, which since the debt crisis of 2001-02 has enjoyed rapid growth based on a cheap currency and low interest rates, and Brazil, which has followed a much more orthodox monetary policy. Neither country is problem free. Flassbeck says rising inflationary pressure in Argentina stems from the failure to follow the example of Asian countries that have used the minimum wage and other forms of incomes policy to control wages; Brazil is heavily dependent on the export of commodities. </p> <p><strong>Low-cost centres</strong></p> <p>The countries that were once in the Soviet bloc have also followed a more traditional route than those in Asia. Their accession to the European Union and optimism about their prospects as low-cost production centres led to massive capital inflows, which have pushed up exchange rates and produced increasingly large current account deficits. </p> <p>From 1999 to 2007, the real effective exchange rate in eastern Europe and the Russian Federation appreciated by 30% and the average current account deficit more than doubled to around 9% of GDP. The vulnerability of these countries to capital flight is illustrated by Hungary, where 90% of mortgages are denominated not in forints but in Swiss francs and Japanese yen.</p> <p>Eastern Europe now looks like an accident waiting to happen. Indeed, it is the likeliest flashpoint for the next stage of the unfolding crisis, provided Italy does not get there first. Russia is less vulnerable than its old satellites but the erosion of manufacturing competitiveness has been disguised by soaring oil and gas prices. Like Brazil, it will look a lot less healthy when the bubble in commodities has deflated and, on current trends, that moment is imminent.</p> <p>There are important lessons from the Unctad study. One is that developed countries with large current account surpluses - Germany and Japan primarily - need policies that stimulate domestic demand. A second is that developing countries seeking a growth model would be better off looking to Beijing than Washington for inspiration. Finally, if the prime minister is really serious about abolishing boom and bust and raising Britain's growth rate, having an over-valued currency, a hollowed out industrial sector and a reliance on hot money is a mighty strange way of going about it. It's vital to learn the lessons of globalisation , even more important to learn the right ones.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The two main candidates for the US presidency locked horns yesterday over the credentials and qualities of Sarah Palin, the little-known governor of Alaska who has been propelled into the centre of the electoral battle with her appointment as John McCain's Republican running mate.</p> <p>As the race now fans out across America at the end of the two parties' national conventions, attention continues to focus on Palin, who has delighted the Christian right base of the Republican party but provoked criticism of her lack of experience, particularly in foreign affairs.</p> <p>Interviewed on politics programmes of the US networks yesterday, McCain and his Democratic opponent, Barack Obama, presented conflicting perspectives on Palin's politics and role in the election.</p> <p>Obama praised her as a skilled politician but rolled out his camp's new weapon - to depict her as a sort of McCain-Bush with brass knobs on. Obama said she was \"even more aligned with George Bush or Dick Cheney and the politics we've seen over the last eight years than John McCain himself\".</p> <p>Obama derided McCain's claim over the weekend that Palin had more foreign affairs experience than he had, by dint of the fact that her state lies next to Russia. \"I actually knew Alaska is next to Russia - I saw it on the map,\" Obama quipped.</p> <p>McCain, who came under heavy fire after he announced Palin as his vice-presidential candidate for picking a lightweight and failing to vet her properly, has been buoyed by her combative speech to his party's convention in Minnesota last week. \"She has a clear record of what Americans want uppermost - reform. She took on the people in her own party,\" said McCain. He characterised Palin's strength as \"taking them on and winning. I've taken them and won less than she has\".</p> <p>Despite the rapturous reception Palin received from the party faithful last week, Republican election strategists remain cautious about exposing her to the full force of the national media. Apart from a soft-soap window on her family life given to People magazine on the day she was selected, she has given no interviews. She will give her first TV interview to ABC later this week. </p> <p>McCain's campaign manager, Rick Davis, said: \"Why would we want to throw Sarah Palin into a cycle of piranhas called the news media that have nothing better to ask questions about than her personal life and her children? [Until] we feel like the news media is going to treat her with some level of respect and deference, I think it would be foolhardy to put her out into that kind of environment.\" </p> <p>The protective cordon has already caused tension. After a CNN presenter last week questioned a Palin aide over her national security experience, McCain pulled out of an interview with CNN's Larry King, saying the channel had gone \"over the line\". Yesterday Palin's Democratic counterpart, Senator Joe Biden, said: \"Eventually she's going to have to answer questions about her record.\"</p>",
  "<p>High-flying chief executives are thriving in the credit crunch even though the pace of pay rises in the boardrooms of Britain's top 350 companies has slowed in the economic downturn, according to a survey out today by consultants Deloitte.</p> <p>The gap between the potential pay of the chief executive and the rest of the board is increasing, as is the differential in the pay of bosses in the 30 biggest companies and those outside the top echelons, Deloitte said.</p> <p>Carol Arrowsmith, partner and head of the remuneration team at Deloitte, believes that companies will seek out the best executives as the business environment deteriorates. \"Previous economic downturns have demonstrated that there are talented leaders who can genuinely change the fortunes of businesses and we expect that 2008/09 will see companies focusing on finding, and retaining, those individuals,\" she said.</p> <p>Even so, she expects the rate of pay increases to abate further next year, after the Deloitte survey showed a 6.2% rise in salaries for directors in the FTSE 350. Though 2% higher than increases in inflation and average earnings it is slower than the 7% recorded in the previous year and the slowest rise this century.</p> <p>The slowdown in the rate of increase is also demonstrated by a survey from Incomes Data Services (IDS), which covers board members and senior managements at companies outside the FTSE 100. In the three months to the end of July, it shows average pay rises were 3.9% - down from 4.7% a year ago. \"Having enjoyed proportionately far more generous pay awards in recent years than their colleagues at lower levels, top-tier management are now starting to share some of the pain felt by their more junior colleagues with pay rises that are not even keeping pace with inflation,\" said Steve Tatton, editor of the IDS executive compensation review.</p> <p>Deloitte's Arrowsmith, who is best known for resolving the row over the pay of the former GlaxoSmithKline chief executive Jean-Pierre Garnier five years ago, predicts that pay rises will slow to 4% to 5% for 2008/09 as the tougher economic climate has an impact on salary rises.</p> <p>The typical salary of a chief executive of a top-30 company is more than \u00a31m against \u00a3750,000 in a company outside that group.</p> <p>Boardroom pay is typically made up of a basic salary enhanced by a cash bonus linked to the company's performance that year. It is often boosted by cash and shares payments related to performance schemes put in place between three and five years previously.</p> <p>Pay consultants such as Arrowsmith, who advises the remuneration committees that set the pay of top bosses, are often blamed for pushing up boardroom pay. Arrowsmith said it was her job to ensure that companies received the right advice to make the right decisions about paying executives.</p> <p>The Deloitte research found that one in four FTSE 100 companies increased the size of the annual bonus for directors in the past year while one in five FTSE 250 companies did the same thing. Awards of shares linked to long-term performance also rose at one in five FTSE 100 companies and one in 10 FTSE 250 companies.</p> <p>\"Award levels have been increasing over a number of years but it is important, particularly in this climate, that there is good reason to increase the award and it raises the pressure on remuneration committees to ensure that the performance targets are robust,\" said Arrowsmith.</p> <p>The survey notes that there were signs shareholders were concerned with some pay schemes. In the current annual general meeting season, 30% of FTSE 100 companies had less than a 90% vote in favour of the remuneration reports, up from 25% in 2007. Until recently, companies would have expected near-unanimous support for resolutions at annual meetings.</p> <p>Arrowsmith noted that since the early 1990s the amount of directors' performance-related pay had risen sharply, from about 50% of basic salary to up to 255% at a FTSE 100 company.</p> <p>In the top 30 companies, long-term share awards could be worth between 125% and 255% of salary compared with 100% to 165% five years ago. But Deloitte noted that long-term awards do not always materialise. Of awards made in 2003 and 2004, about 30% made to directors of FTSE 100 companies lapsed completely.</p>",

  "<p>The story's ingredients were a tabloid editors' wet dream, and the plot seemed to have been lifted straight out of one of the lurid soap operas that glue Egyptians to their TV sets every Ramadan. The sultry young pop star with a troubled past, the real-estate mogul with close links to the president, and a gruesome murder in a Dubai apartment \u2013 this was a drama of glamour, money and betrayal played out by synthetic people in a synthetic world, a million miles away from the lives of ordinary Egyptians.</p> <p>But the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7593906.stm\">brutal killing</a> of Lebanese diva <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzanne_Tamim\">Suzanne Tamim</a> and the subsequent arrest of Egyptian property tycoon <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hisham_Talaat_Moustafa\">Hisham Talaat Moustafa</a> on murder charges was very real, and shockwaves are already being felt in the corridors of power. Moustafa is a high-ranking government insider, a member of the ruling National Democratic party's \"supreme policies council\" and a personal friend of President Hosni Mubarak, whose regime has become notorious for its close links with rich businessmen.</p> <p>Tamim was a 30-year-old <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybjGGuMwHvY&amp;feature=related\">singer</a> from Beirut who rose to fame after appearing on a Lebanese talent show in the mid-1990s. Renowned by many for her beauty and her voice \u2013 which could tackle modern pop and classical Arabic melodies with equal finesse \u2013 Tamim's star rose and then waned as troubles in her personal life escalated. A failed marriage to her manager led her to flee to Cairo and by last year she had faded completely from public view. The name of this once bright young talent was only hauled back from obscurity in June, when her body was found with multiple stab wounds at one of her homes in Dubai. The Arab world was quickly gripped by the murder and Tamim's face stared out of newspaper front pages for weeks on end \u2013 except in Egypt, where a judicial ban on media discussion of the case was imposed after a leading opposition paper claimed that a prominent business figure from the government's inner circle was being investigated for homicide.</p> <p>The attempted information blackout finally collapsed this week when it <a href=\"http://www.dailystaregypt.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=16195\">emerged</a> that Moustafa, said by local newspapers to be a former lover of Tamim's, had been arrested in Egypt in connection with the crime. Prosecutors allege that he paid a former police officer, Mohsen el-Sukkari, $2m to follow Tamim from Egypt to London and finally on to Dubai, where he tricked his way into her house and fatally attacked her. Both men could now face the death penalty.</p> <p>The twists and turns of Tamim's demise are the subject of endless discussion on the streets of Cairo, but talk of this tragedy goes well beyond the sphere of celebrity gossip. Firstly, the domestic media ban on reporting details of the case proved to be the latest hamfisted attempt by the Egyptian government to control the increasingly vociferous independent newspaper sector. Like other attempts before it to apply stale methods of state censorship to a globalised media environment, the ban only served to heighten interest in what was going on. The previous week taping of a programme featuring democracy activists that was being recorded for American satellite channel al-Hurra was summarily <a href=\"http://menassat.com/?q=en/alerts/4506-egypt-two-al-hurra-programs-democracy-stopped\">cancelled</a> by the authorities; the week before that, allegations of government deceit in the events surrounding the Egyptian parliament fire were prevented from hitting the streets when the government-owned printing presses halted production of an independent newspaper.</p> <p>News emerged recently that internet cafes will soon be forced to log the <a href=\"http://www.anhri.net/en/reports/2008/pr0809.shtml\">personal details</a> of all their users, whilst a draft law creating a new code of \"media ethics\" has been <a href=\"http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/2008/08/20088791952617974.html\">dismissed</a> by human rights organisations as a naked bid to strangle the burgeoning pro-democracy movement.</p> <p>The problem for the government is that after permitting a small degree of freedom into the previously monolithic state-dominated Egyptian media world, it is struggling to get the cat back into the bag as rising discontent at economic hardship and the lack of political reform finds a voice in the new wave of news outlets. The regime is resorting to old-fashioned legal bullying to try and manipulate the information reaching its citizens, but as the Tamim story shows they are doomed to failure. Even as al-Dostour, the paper that originally claimed an NDP bigwig was connected with the murder, was being pulled from newsstands, other pan-Arab newspapers featuring all the gory details \u2013 many printed as far afield as London - were flying in to Cairo. And while the staff of Al-Dostour were being <a href=\"http://www.dailystaregypt.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=15723\">grilled</a> by security officers, <a href=\"http://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/09/03/egypt-tycoon-arrested-in-singers-murder-2/\">bloggers</a> were spreading the identity of Tamim's alleged murderer on the web, along with detailed updates on al-Dostour's expurgation from the streets. Just like repressive regimes the world over, Egypt's political elite are finding it increasingly difficult to restrict the flow of facts they find uncomfortable.</p> <p>Perhaps more importantly though, the really shocking detail to surface from Tamim's death wasn't that a prominent businessman had been linked to her murder, but that the government had actually arrested the man in question and even stripped him of his parliamentary immunity (Moustafa sat in the Shura council, the upper house of Egypt's parliament). I have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/27/egypt.middleeast\">written here before</a> of the series of corruption scandals that have rocked the NDP and fuelled widespread scorn at the government's intimacy with the business world \u2013 a self-serving alliance strengthened by the current prime minister's aggressive neoliberal economic reforms, which have earned <a href=\"http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2006/825/eg2.htm\">plaudits</a> from the World Bank but sent inflation spiralling and widened the <br><a href=\"http://www.mg.co.za/article/2008-05-04-as-mubarak-turns-80-egypt-faces-inflation-unrest\">chasm</a> between rich and poor in this vastly unequal society. The level of government protection afforded to the moneyed elite is so great that Egyptians have grown wearily familiar of the corruption bandwagon, which always seems to end in acquittal for the accused and the resumption of business as usual. \"As long as businessmen remain the backbone of the NDP, these scandals will continue,\" insists the editor of Nasserist newspaper al-Arabi.</p> <p>So what to make of Moustafa's very public arrest for Tamim's killing, which sent shares in his vast business empire, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/facesinthenews/2008/09/03/moustafa-tamim-egypt-face-markets-cx_dp_0903autofacescan04.html\">TMG Holdings</a>, into freefall? Will there be the predictable rigged trial before the charges are dropped, or is the judicial energy expended on the case a sign that something fundamental has changed within this increasingly defensive governing clique? \"Moustafa's indictment is clear evidence that the ruling party knows no cronyism and that nobody in Egypt is above the law\", declared the NDP's secretary for media affairs grandly. The rapidity with which Moustafa was stripped of parliamentary immunity also took opposition politicians by surprise, with many acknowledging that the NDP seemed to be trying to improve its image.</p> <p>But anybody who believes the government is really looking to shake off its reputation as the party of business is deluding themselves. Mubarak's coalition of political interests sustains itself through money, a ruling class that enjoys no popular legitimacy but survives by keeping the country's most powerful economic forces in its inner circle, spreading around to them the cash generated by privatisation, the sale of assets to foreign multinationals and the slow dismantling of the welfare state. Cronyism may make it unpopular on the streets, but regardless of what happens to Moustafa the government cannot afford to abandon its wealthy friends.</p> <p>Amidst all of the political and economic pyrotechnics in the wake of Tamim's death, it would be easy to forget that this too was a very human tragedy. Tamim was <a href=\"http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2003/667/eg6.htm\">not the first</a> Arabic female pop star who ended up dead after suffering from abusive partners and a restless private life, and given the <a href=\"http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/babylonbeyond/2008/09/middle-east-the.html\">exploitative relationships</a> which dominate the music industry here, she may not be the last.</p> <p>For the government, however, the real drama lies in the public response to her murder and the growing cynicism on the streets at clumsy media manipulation and the legal sheltering of the president's business allies. It is a story set to be as equally dramatic as the sultry pop singer, the real-estate mogul, and the gruesome murder in a Dubai apartment.</p>",

  "<p>Once again, Britain trade unions can help save \u2013 or help destroy \u2013 Labour as a party fit for government. In the 1930s, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Bevin\">Ernest Bevin</a> saved the Labour party from wandering off into the irrelevance of non-intervention in Spain and thinking that a peace pledge petition would stop Hitler from annexing German-speaking parts of Czechoslovakia.</p> <p>Bevin, after 1945, dragged Labour away from a fatal embrace with Stalinism and, instead, created Nato, the Marshall plan, and despite being howled down by the left at the Labour party conference because union demands for inflationary pay rises could not be met, he kept Labour as a mainstream party fit for power.</p> <p>In contrast, the roaring TUC denunciations of Jim Callaghan's government in the 1970s, and the unleashing of the winter of discontent in 1978-79, helped bring back the Tories. The TUC's language in the early 1980s \u2013 anti-Europe, anti-America, anti-economic reform, anti-everything \u2013 helped hand Thatcher her victories in 1983 and 1987.</p> <p>Fast forward to the late 1980s and early 1990s and brave union leaders like Bill Morris, Bill Jordan and John Monks took Labour out of the clutches of Scargillism, or of those who claimed that bringing Japanese car factories to the north east meant importing \"alien practices\" (called jobs) to the UK. Former Communist leaders of genius like the AEU's Jimmy Airlie understood it was time to park the militant rhetoric of denunciation of Labour and, instead, forge a new alliance with reformist, modernising Blair-Brown politics.</p> <p>Again, its was the trade union leaders who saved Labour, broke the back of Stalinist control and Trotskyist infiltration of trade unions and local Labour party organisation.</p> <p>Today, the Tories are coming back, the BNP is growing, but some TUC leaders <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/07/labourleadership.ordonbrown&quot;\">reserve their fire</a> for Labour. This is forward to the past. Not to the past of an Ernie Bevin, or the Morris-Monks-Jordan alliance, which helped defeat the Tories, but to the past of the 1970s and early 1980s, in which Labour was denounced by trade unions. Trade union leaders <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/07/tradeunions.labour\">are queuing up</a> to dig the grave of a Labour government.</p> <p>This is possibly the last TUC congress before a general election, and certainly the last but one before an election in 2010. This might be the moment to celebrate the massive reallocation of resources under Labour in favour of working people, which has seen not only 900,000 more workers join the public sector, but also British industry take a bigger share of GDP than industry in France. Plus a raft of social justice measures from the minimum wage to five weeks' paid holiday and every ministry with open doors to trade union delegations.</p> <p>But no. The language is full of hate and anger. Derek Simpson, the Unite joint leader <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/07/tradeunions.labour\">even tells</a> the Observer, \"We might as well elect Cameron.\" Did I read that right? It was in the midst of a stream of abuse against David Miliband. In Moscow, Miliband is denounced as a \"Jew\". For Simpson, he is \"smug\" and \"arrogant\".</p> <p>As far as I know, poor Mr Miliband has not said a word about unions in recent times, though \u2013 unlike Tory foreign secretaries \u2013 he has invited TUC leaders to dinner and gone to see them at Congress House.</p> <p>It is not clear what provoked Simpson's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Vyshinsky \">Vyshinsky</a>-style abuse against our foreign secretary. But for a senior labour movement leader, this use of language about one of our top ministers is worrying and serious. David Miliband <a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jFj5byJOCsrma8hRzhkSa-RrY6VA \">is engaged</a> in serious international business at the moment over Russia's invasion and part-annexation of Georgia as well as difficulties in Pakistan and the anger of Kashmiris in the Indian-occupied part of Kashmir. There is a tricky UN general assembly to deal with.</p> <p>When Ernest Bevin was seeking to promote a post 1945 settlement based on Labour values, he told conference delegates not \"to stab me in the back\".</p> <p>Miliband would be foolish to rise to Simpson's abuse; the quickest way Labour can lose the next election is to indulge in this kind of name-calling at the highest level. It makes Labour look quarrelsome, riven by personality conflicts, and obsessed with itself. It is a one-way ticket to defeat and oblivion \u2013 and TUC leaders should not be punching it.</p> <p>Every Labour MP and union branch official knows the difficulties our people are going through. I spent time with union branch officials at my local hospital last week, and three of them said the problem was there were too many foreigners or immigrants in Rotherham. Not true, but a shudder of fear and cold went through my heart that union representatives could use this BNP language. We had a friendly talk and I hope I persuaded them that Britain has been made by different people from different regions with different religions and different tongues coming to live here.</p> <p>But then I switched on the BBC R4 news on Saturday night and a woman union leader was ranting with hate against energy companies. As it happens, there is a good case for a windfall tax and it got Gordon Brown's chancellorship off to a cracking start in 1997. The Tories imposed windfall taxes and President Sarkozy has just imposed a tax on unearned income for France's middle classes in order to pay for his version of the working families tax credit.</p> <p>But the case will be made not with roaring student union rhetoric and abuse of companies, but by the kind of rational expose advanced by the Tory-controlled Local Government Association. Every MP, every union official and every citizen has his or her ideas of what the government should do. The call is for change \u2013 as if there were off-the-shelf policies that could stop the global economic crisis of rising costs of fuel, food and credit, which is hitting every democratic nation hard. But an honest union leadership would have to explain, as did an earlier generation of union leaders who helped Labour defeat the Tories that, with the state taking 45% of the GDP in revenue and with massive commitment to pay for extra teachers, nurses, public service delivery and still keep taxes at a level that does not produce voter revolt, the room for Labour's manoeuvre is limited. But where are the calm voices of reason to be heard at the TUC?</p> <p>Unions in Britain, in Europe, in North America, everywhere, are losing members as they continue structures, organisation and leadership based on 20th-century industrial society models. They are more than ever needed, as capitalism explodes across the planet at a speed far ahead of that which society and politics can keep up with.</p> <p>But unions need a government that at least is prepared to listen to them. Right now, too much of the rhetoric at the TUC puts Labour up as the main enemy to be defeated. Abuse of the foreign secretary \u2013 or any minister and the prime minister \u2013 is Christmas squared to the Tories (as they cheerfully admit). In the past, trade unions helped save Labour. Today, they appear to want to bury the party they founded.</p>",
  "<p>Over the last year, as the US economy has slipped toward (and likely into) recession, there has been much talk of decoupling. According to this idea the global economy has decoupled from the US economy and can continue growing even if the US goes into recession. </p> <p>That idea is now proving fragile. Instead of decoupling, the global economy is showing signs of a concertina effect. Thus, as the US economy grinds to a halt, much of the rest of the world seems to be also slowing and bumping in behind.</p> <p>Ever since the East Asian financial crisis of 1997 the US has served as the locomotive of the global economy. This locomotive role has had US consumers engage in a 10-year consumption binge financed by debt and rising house prices. That binge pushed the household saving rate to record lows, and it also resulted in record US trade deficits.</p> <p>Trade data show the US has run large trade deficits with every major industrial region of the global economy \u2013 Europe, Japan, China, East Asia, Canada and Mexico. That pumped spending into these regions, fuelling their growth. </p> <p>This economic arrangement has created a dependence on the US market, and the dependence has been further deepened by policies of export-led growth. Unable or unwilling to grow their own domestic markets, countries have relied on policies that explicitly promote exports.</p> <p>In many developing countries these policies have had the added benefit of attracting foreign direct investment (FDI). Thus, exports have kept factories busy, while the prospect of future exports has tempted companies to relocate production facilities to developing economies. Meanwhile, the US economy has benefited from cheap imports, but its manufacturing sector has been eroded and consumers have loaded up on debt in an unsustainable fashion.</p> <p>The bursting of the US house price bubble has shifted this process into reverse, slowing US import growth and replacing financial exuberance with financial fear. But rather than global decoupling, there are signs of a shared global slowdown. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Free_Trade_Agreement\">Nafta</a> economies of Canada and Mexico are clearly vulnerable because of their large trade dependence on the US and their tight integration into the US supply chain. In Europe, Ireland, Spain and Italy are either in recession or on the cusp of recession. Growth has slowed sharply too in the UK and France, and Japan has also lowered its growth outlook.</p> <p>Germany, which is Europe's largest economy, was supposed to replace the US locomotive. However, it is one of the world's most export-dependent economies. German growth has kept going longer than other European economies because of low consumer debt and export growth to Opec economies, but Germany is now also slowing. Moreover, its policies of wage restraint and hyper-export competitiveness pose a menace rather than a help to the overall European economy.</p> <p>The hope that China could pull East Asia through a US slowdown was always a fiction. A quick inspection of China's trade shows that its trade deficits with other East Asian economies are derived from its trade surpluses with the US. China assembles imported parts from the rest of East Asia and sells the assembled product in US markets. That means when the US slows, the slowdown ripples back via China into the broader East Asian economy.</p> <p>The commodity-exporting economies of Australia, Latin America, and Africa have all done well from the commodity price boom. However, if the industrial economies of North America, Europe and East Asia slow, that can be expected to negatively impact commodity prices and exports.</p> <p>Closer co-movements of national economies are a logical consequence of corporate and financial globalisation since it makes economies more inter-dependent. Those co-movements can become a concertina when they are driven by a common factor such as export-led growth that relies on debt-financed US consumers serving as buyer of last resort.</p> <p>The key to avoiding a concerted global downturn is for developed economies to sustain confidence in financial markets, resist misdiagnosed calls for a war on inflation, and initiate policies that strengthen demand. Meanwhile, developing countries must continue spending even as their exports to the US slow. These countries now have the foreign exchange reserves to ride out a weakened trade outlook. The open question is whether they have the sources of internal demand.</p> <p>Developing that internal demand is a core problem. However, it remains off the development policy agenda because the current paradigm is obsessed with the supply-side and neglects development of the demand-side. As long as that is so, the global economy will remain beset by an unstable and inadequate configuration of demand.</p>",
  "<p>There is a scene in the first act of the hit Broadway musical <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent_(musical)\">Rent</a> in which the leader of an Aids support group gently scrutinises a pessimistic group member. \"Why choose fear?\" the leader asks. \"I'm a New Yorker,\" the pessimist replies. Dramatic pause. \"Fear's my life\". </p> <p>Today, as the musical <a href=\"http://www.playbill.com/news/article/120795.html\">ends its 12-year run</a>, New Yorkers are told repeatedly that they are safer than ever, that their city's future is bright, shining and green, with access to housing, transportation and environmental protection practically assured for all, including the 1 million new city residents projected to swell the population by the year 2030. In this light, the wounded self-examination of the fictional New Yorker feels dated despite its cynical charm, like any given Woody Allen opus. Times change, after all. Neighbourhood identities mature, and nobody likes a curmudgeon.</p> <p>The remarkable, near-fanatical popularity of the musical stemmed, in large part, from its ability to capture (in song, no less) the issues of its day: the gentrification of New York's Lower East Side neighbourhood beneath the shadow of the national Aids crisis and runaway corporate greed. Set in 1989, Rent portrays a coarse urban landscape that reads essentially like an unsophisticated rough draft of the contemporary New York. Now the show's producers <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/01/16/entertainment/main3720219.shtml\">cite falling ticket sales</a> as the reason for its closure.</p> <p>And no wonder \u2013 the halcyon days of the musical's unrealistic bohemia are gone, right? Gentrification has had its say, hasn't it? The show may have been among the first to prominently feature taboos like homosexuality, Aids and inter-racial relationships, but what do we know of taboos in this post-<a href=\"http://www.bravotv.com/\">Bravo</a> reality television age?</p> <p>Like any musical worth its discount student rush ticket, what Rent gave us was a certain sense of perspective on what is now the nearly universal human condition of urban life. For the first time in human history, <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/survey/so/2007/res104a.htm\">more than 50%</a> of the world's population lives in urban areas and deals with the unrelenting stress of housing crises, market manipulations, public health problems and unresponsive urban governance \u2013 issues which, coincidentally, make up the narrative bulk of Rent and which, despite the show's closing, are still in heavy rotation in New York and around the world.</p> <p>The end of Rent doesn't neatly coincide with a safe, warm hug from the city of New York. It comes instead at a time when new condominium towers cast shadows on shuttered family-owned businesses, and <a href=\"http://www.villagevoice.com/2007-06-19/news/the-second-battle-of-bushwick/\">new battlegrounds</a> are drawn over gentrification, race and class in the formerly sleepy neighbourhoods of the city's outer boroughs. </p> <p>The last Rent, as it were, is a particularly compelling counterpoint to the now well-documented mortgage crisis, whose widespread devastation of the American real-estate market has thrust the issue of housing back onto the national stage. Not since massive waves of foreclosure and abandonment ripped up America's urban cores in the 1970s have we been this aware of the imbalance created by inadequate housing policy, real-estate speculation and lack of accountability for their failures.</p> <p>In June of this year, the American National Association of Realtors reported that 17% of the inventory of existing homes for sale are the result of foreclosures. In August, the website RealtyTrac released <a href=\"http://www.realtytrac.com/ContentManagement/pressrelease.aspx?ChannelID=9&amp;ItemID=5041&amp;accnt=64847\">a report showing a 55% increase in foreclosures</a> from July 2007, with Nevada, California and Florida being the hardest hit. In a sense, what we have is the drama of Rent writ large \u2013 very, very large \u2013 across America's built environment.</p> <p>The question is, what happens next? In the musical, the cracks left by urban blight were filled by squatters who lived or otherwise used unoccupied spaces without permission. The same is happening in unexpectedly suburban places today, with uneven results. Vilified for violating the tenets of property rights, squatters were and still often are the first to recognise the livability of abandoned places, highlighting the injustice of unused space in the time of housing crisis. In today's New York, <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9801E6D6113DF933A1575BC0A9649C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2\">some squatters</a> have survived over 20 years of clashing with city government and through negotiations have won the legal rights to the buildings they've helped maintain since the early 1980s.</p> <p>But the millions of empty homes around the country can't wait that long, and neither can the residents who have fallen in the cracks between policy and the speculative games of the real-estate market. Housing problems, like fear of the future, have never been unique to dense urban environments. More than an updated version of a popular musical, what the country needs most is <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/topics/housing.aspx\">a new set of housing policies</a> on the national level from a rejuvenated department of housing and urban development. Now that would give renters and homeowners something to sing about.</p>",

  "<p>Towards the end of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/01_january/17/god.shtml\">God on Trial</a>, broadcast on Wednesday on BBC 2, a group of Auschwitz prisoners concluded that God was indeed guilty of breaking his covenant with the Jews. Their response? They prayed. </p> <p>This scene highlighted what is arguably the more telling paradox at the heart of the God-and-suffering issue. For perhaps the harder question is not the philosophical or logical one of how to reconcile a God of love with a suffering world, but rather the existential or personal question of why so many people persist with faith despite their own experience of suffering. </p> <p>If we consider the global scene, the response of the Auschwitz prisoners is not atypical, but rather the norm. Across Africa, for instance, God is guilty of allowing atrocious barbarism to occur, yet still the vast majority of Africans trust and pray and hope. And just a few weeks ago in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/aug/19/drama.religion\">an article for G2</a>, Frank Cottrell Boyce, who wrote God on Trial, talks of the struggle his own faith encountered as he confronted these issues, and how at the end of it, his faith \"blew stronger\". Why is this? And why do we see this pattern so frequently? For, if <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hume\">David Hume</a> and a succession of philosophers since him are right, rather than foster faith, the reality of suffering should lead to its demise. </p> <p>As I've indicated, though, that is not what we perceive. In those parts of our world where pain, hardship and distress are far more prevalent, we find the highest rates of faith, while it is in the relatively comfortable and affluent west where faith is least observed. This is the precise reverse of what we would expect if Hume's argument had any real weight. How do we account for this?</p> <p>Of course, one of the answers given at this point is to posit a form of cultural intellectual hegemony and suggest that the reason all those Africans retain their faith in God is simply that they haven't thought through the issue sufficiently. If only they had the benefit of the enlightenment eyes with which we are blessed then they too would realise that the reality of suffering disproves the existence of God. Perhaps it is no coincidence that David Hume, who in support of his atheism expounded the problem of suffering, also said: \"I am apt to suspect the negroes and in general all other species of men \u2026 to be naturally inferior to the whites.\"</p> <p>Such blatant racism, either from Hume or his contemporary followers, must not be tolerated. The idea that we have anything to teach Africans about suffering would be laughable, were it not so painful. So, the question remains, why does faith persist in the face of such suffering? Given that it is not due to a lack of intellect, or a failure to think through the issues \u2013 what is the answer?</p> <p>Before I became a theologian, I was training as a paediatrician. In that capacity, on occasions, I had to give treatments or conduct tests that were uncomfortable and distressing for the children. Not surprisingly, some of the children did not respond to me particularly warmly as a result. Yet, perhaps remarkably, despite the fact that at times it was their parents who held them tightly during these procedures, the children never failed to continue to show love and affection towards them. Indeed, even when it was the parents who did these things they continued \u2013 as soon as the painful procedure was over \u2013 to throw themselves into their parents' arms. Why this difference of reaction? </p> <p>I would suggest it is because while their main experience of me was either neutral or unpleasant, their experience of their parents was of ongoing care, love, compassion, feeding, warmth, and so on. So when, on occasions, their parents did things they neither liked, nor always understood (if they were too young), they were able to put those experiences in the context of an overall picture of unconditional love. Even though they couldn't always understand why their parents let this particular thing happen, they knew that their parent loved them despite it.</p> <p>Is it possible that this is also why suffering can produce such starkly different responses in people of faith and people of none? Atheists or agnostics do not have a context of God's love into which this particular painful tragedy can be relativised. All they have is the tragedy itself, and no wonder their response is an even more ardent form of atheism or animosity towards the god hypothesis. In contrast, the people of faith do have such a context. This means that even though they may not be able to explain why God would allow this particular event to occur, they know that the God who on countless other occasions has demonstrated his love and compassion must have a reason. Almost certainly, such a reason has something to do with human freewill, which includes the ability of some to abuse their freedom by infringing that of others. Of course, for those who consider their rationality to be on a par with God's, such an answer will fail to suffice. For they like to think they could have designed a better world in which everyone has complete freedom to act, but remarkably no-one would freely choose to harm another. </p> <p>African Christians, then, who have an awareness of God's love and compassion, are entirely rational to conclude that their own particular suffering must be fitted into a wider context than just this event. There is nothing illogical in them continuing to believe, for they feel the force of the argument that all that is required to reconcile God's love, power and the presence of suffering is merely the presence of some reason that may or may not be fully accessible to them, but that nevertheless justifies God (like the parent) in allowing some tragedy to occur for the sake of a greater good. In saying this, it's important to see that the logical force of this argument does not depend on us knowing the nature of that greater good, or how precisely the calculation works. The freewill of humanity as a whole (but not as individuals) may or may not be that greater good. But what matters (logically, though not I acknowledge emotionally) is whether there is such a greater good, not whether we are aware of its precise contours.</p> <p>However, the atheist does not have that wider context. And if you also like to think that you and God are on the same intellectual plane, then all you have left is raw, illogical, indeed insane, pain. Hence, within the confines of their limited perspective, such a person is also entirely rational to conclude that God cannot exist. </p> <p>The presence of suffering, then, does not disprove the existence of God, but it does confirm us in whatever belief system we already had. As was noted in the film by one of the Auschwitz prisoners, quoting the French philosopher, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_de_La_Rochefoucauld_(writer)\">La Rochefoucauld</a>, \"A great storm puts out a little fire, but it feeds a strong one.\" And that is why the author of this horrific narrative found his faith blowing even stronger at the end.</p>"
