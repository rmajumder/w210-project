  "<p><strong>Lub's dance moves</strong><br>Britain's most eagerly anticipated nightclub opening for a decade takes place on 19 September, when Matter opens its doors at the O2 centre in London. The purpose-built club has room for 2,600 revellers and a 'body kinetic dancefloor' - apparently 80 transducers (similar to speakers) are connected to the floor and emit bass frequencies directly into the dancers' skeletons. The club will host both live music and DJs - the opening weekend sees UNKLE (live), Late of the Pier and Iglu &amp; Hartly on the Friday, followed on Saturday night (through to 7am Sunday) by Carl Cox.

  "<p>On contemplating the literary career of AN Wilson, the only proper reaction is awe at his extraordinary productivity. By my count, he has published almost 40 books - although there have been so many it's hard to keep track - and he can hardly be accused of ducking the big questions, since they include biographies of Milton, Tolstoy, Jesus and St Paul as well as novels of sufficient quality that the last was Booker-longlisted. </p> <p>Six years ago, he moved into the field of history with a long, rich and evocative portrait of the Victorian age; three years ago, he published a sequel, rather unimaginatively titled After the Victorians, which was even more opinionated, a fair bit sloppier and no less entertaining. Now we have his take on the last half-century, a book with all the weaknesses of swift writing and superficial research, but, almost infuriatingly, all the strengths of Wilson's wit and literary insight.</p> <p>While Our Times is structured along fairly predictable lines, interweaving chapters of political narrative with sections on such subjects as the rise of permissiveness and the decline of Christian worship, that is the only predictable thing about it. </p> <p>In fact, there is plenty to make more sober historians blench. It is hard, for example, to imagine many academics repeating the funny (if well-worn) story about Diana Dors, n\u00e9e Fluck, being introduced at a church fete by a Swindon vicar as 'Diana Clunt', and then giving the reference as Wikipedia. Most historians wouldn't ignore economic matters almost altogether, as Wilson does, nor would they agree with his claims that Clement Attlee and Ernest Bevin wanted to dismantle the empire. </p> <p>And, as was the case with After the Victorians, some of Wilson's factual errors almost defy belief. Getting the dates of the Glorious Revolution (too late) and the Siege of Derry (too early) is one thing, but when Edward Heath goes to the country in February 1972, two years too early, you almost wonder if Wilson is doing it deliberately.</p> <p>As a work of serious history, in other words, this book is an abject failure. As a very funny, extremely opinionated, always provocative and often thoughtful read, however, it is a terrific success, a verdict that will no doubt disappoint many historians who do know their dates but have none of Wilson's fizz. True, he can be very glib, arguing, for instance, that the Cold War was a clash of 'uncertainties' rather than certainties, which only goes to show that he has been reading too much John le Carr\u00e9 and not enough (indeed, not any) documents from Washington and Moscow. </p> <p>And yet he is capable of serious and incisive judgments, especially when discussing the struggle between religion and secularism, something of an obsession here but a powerful theme often neglected. </p> <p>The erosion of the old 'tribal magic', as he calls it, is one of the keys to the book. In Wilson's eyes, the decline of religious belief is one of the central elements in the erosion of social order. Its absence explains the enduring appeal of such writers as JRR Tolkien, a man he hugely admires, and whose influence on the global imagination, he points out, has been greater than that of any other post-war British writer.</p> <p>Above all, Wilson is endlessly entertaining. He compares Benjamin Britten not with Tippett or Vaughan Williams but with, of all people, Sid James, while later he develops an elaborate comparison between Tony Blair and TV presenter Philip Schofield. His treatment of the monarchy is a strange and always funny mixture of deference and contempt. The Queen, although 'shy and stilted', emerges well. Prince Charles wins praise for his environmental and architectural enthusiasms and Diana is described as 'truly great'. By contrast, Prince Philip comes across as mildly ridiculous. 'I'm nothing but an amoeba!' he yells when told that the Queen will not take his surname. Yet he gets off lightly compared with Lord Mountbatten, in Wilson's view a 'mass murderer' for his 'gross mismanagement in India', and later an 'elderly popinjay, with his arrogant manners and his fondness for naval ratings'.</p> <p>Wilson's character sketches are often masterpieces of injustice. He considers the Beatles pretentious and, bizarrely, describes the Rolling Stones as 'in every way more talented', even describing Mick Jagger as one of the world's great ironists. But his real targets are politicians of all stripes, who usually come off badly. Enoch Powell emerges as a bristling madman, with his Birmingham accent constantly maligned. Harold Wilson, rumoured to have got one of the best firsts in Oxford's history, is 'half-educated'. Ted Heath's hapless Chancellor Anthony Barber 'seemed like a man playing the vicar in a suburban amateur dramatic society'. John Hume, a secular saint in some quarters, was 'weasly'. Jim Callaghan was simply a 'bonehead'. </p> <p>Yet other characters comes in for peculiarly lavish praise. He admires John Major for his 'unflappability' and 'understatedness', while David Owen is lauded for his 'powerful charisma' and 'high intelligence' and would have been 'one of the truly great Prime Ministers'.</p> <p>The politician who gets the biggest beating is Roy Jenkins, or 'Woy', as Wilson calls him throughout. Since Jenkins is usually the hero of books like this, there is something unexpectedly and perversely refreshing about finding him traduced. When Woy first surfaces, Wilson draws attention to his 'Balliol bumptiousness' and 'claret-marinaded dinner-party manners' and mocks the 'pomposity of his aristocratic, high-table verbal mannerisms ... the ever-stirring right hand, sometimes to emphasise a debating point, sometimes to feel along a hostess's thigh'. But he is only warming up, for when Woy reappears as a founder of the SDP, he is 'puffed-up, pompous and vacuous'. He was, Wilson tells us, 'an incompetent Home Secretary and a disastrous Chancellor', his achievements dwarfed by those of Margaret Thatcher, a 'person of high intelligence'.</p> <p>This might suggest that Wilson is an unalloyed admirer of Thatcher and Thatcherism, but that is not really true. He clearly approved of her guts and vision, but at the same time he bemoans the consequences of her uncompromising revolution, from the communities destroyed by unemployment to the traditional folkways concreted over in the name of the market.</p> <p>Beneath all the jokes and the sneers, he has a serious point to make. Britain, he laments, has 'stopped being British', a process he blames partly on immigration (wrongly, in my view), but also on globalisation, market economics and the uncritical worship of novelty. There is no need to share his more reactionary prejudices to concede that he has a point, just as there is no need to share his hatred of poor Woy Jenkins to enjoy this infuriating, passionate, hilarious and sometimes plain barmy book.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Dominic Sandbrook's most recent book is White Heat: A History of Britain in the Swinging Sixties (Abacus)</p>",
  "<p>The manufacturing sector has fared reasonably well on the whole in recent years. After a torrid time during the previous decade, I think lots of companies either went to the wall, or they got their act together and survived. </p> <p>The pound is looking significantly weaker than it did a year ago, but there are pros and cons to that: it will help when bidding for business in overseas markets but, on the other hand, a lot of the components that we buy are becoming more expensive. </p> <p>Manufacturers are not quite as gung ho as they were a few months ago. They're feeling the squeeze. The financial services crisis is hitting the retail industry, construction and so forth, and there will be knock-on effects. But manufacturers are not nearly as dependent on the UK as they used to be. They've got their eggs in more baskets now.</p> <p>Even in the most developed Western economies, manufacturing continues to play an important part. Naturally, what happens is that as economies grow and become more complex, new sectors evolve, and these take up a growing proportion of GDP; but that doesn't mean manufacturing will disappear altogether.</p> <p>It will continue to play an important role in our economy, but we have to recognise where it's strong: it's either very high-tech and high value, or it can be lower tech, where the supply chain is short.</p> <p>I do think government now recognises that manufacturing is important. What it needs to do is create a business-friendly environment and infrastructure, where manufacturers and other industrialists are encouraged to set up shop in this country - and not tinker with it. The key thing is that we must have a very consistent, long-term approach. The worst thing the sector can have is fundamental changes, such as the sudden alterations made to capital gains tax last year. That creates a lot of uncertainty.</p> <p>The ideal thing would obviously be to maintain a stable tax environment with, preferably, lower tax levels. The next thing I would mention is regulation, which obviously affects small companies the most. That is a message that government has bought into.</p> <p>Another crucial area is skills and education. There are not enough talented people studying pure technical subjects. I also think it is a shame people in the UK generally, because English is their mother tongue, don't think they need to learn other languages.</p> <p>Careers advice is also very poor. Teachers should polish up their act on that front and manufacturers themselves have to be more active. Going into schools and talking to children would definitely encourage them to consider working in manufacturing when they finish their education. Our culture certainly isn't as entrepreneurial as that of the United States, but my instinct is that it's getting a hell of a lot better.</p> <p>At Siemens, we are fortunate in the sectors where we have specialised. The UK is putting enormous investment into power generation and distribution, and we are a leader in wind power. There is also a lot of money going into the railways. We have been building trains to replace the old slam-door rolling stock on the south-west franchise. And, when it comes to the medical sector, the fact is people are living longer, and we as a nation are going to have to spend more on healthcare.</p> <p>The parts of our business that may be hit are the ones supplying the consumer market and the general industrial sector. Something like a quarter of our workforce is still directly employed in manufacturing, and Siemens is very much a UK manufacturer, employing almost 20,000 staff here.</p> <p>At our factory in Congleton, Cheshire, where we make standard variable speed drives, the workforce really pulls together with the management to bring about improvements; and we complement that with sourcing components from parts of the world where they cost less to produce, when it's appropriate. In Llanberis, north Wales, our healthcare business produces reagents for specialist pathology labs, to test blood samples from all over the globe.</p> <p>And because we are supplying the whole of the European market, there is a big advantage in having a short logistics chain. If your supplier is on your doorstep, you can change your requirements at a moment's notice.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Alan Wood is the UK chairman of Siemens and the president of the Engineering Employers Federation</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown will whisk his entire cabinet off to Birmingham tomorrow to launch a 'manufacturing strategy', and remind them there is life outside the capital, where the credit crunch has caused thousands of City job losses and induced profound economic gloom.</p> <p>Manufacturing, all too easily written off as outmoded or dull, has rarely been high among Labour's priorities, and has not evinced grand-sounding measures such as the 'high-level group on city competitiveness' Brown established when he was Chancellor to safeguard the interests of London's financial services firms.</p> <p>But if there is the faintest glimmer of a silver lining to the coming economic downturn, it is that manufacturing may begin to command more interest from policymakers whose faith in the power of the City has been shaken, and that the sharp downward slide in the value of the pound should give Britain's exporters a very welcome fillip.</p> <p>Holidaymakers returning to these chilly shores will already have noticed the marked weakening of the pound, as they totted up the cost of their travels; but sterling has taken another lurch downwards in the past fortnight, given extra momentum by Alistair Darling's controversial claim from his croft in the Hebrides that the economic situation is now at its worst for 60 years.</p> <p>Veteran currency traders quip that the pound tends to go 'up the stairs and down the escalator': in other words, when it does weaken, it can happen very rapidly. Nevertheless, many analysts have been surprised at the violence of the sell-off. Since last autumn, the pound has lost 15 per cent of its value against the currencies of Britain's major trading partners.</p> <p>'Sterling's paying a bit for the honesty of the policymakers - Alistair Darling and Mervyn King have been quite blunt about the chances of recession,' says Steve Barrow of Standard Chartered.</p> <p>Jonathan Loynes, European economist at consultancy Capital Economics, believes sterling's slide is one of the few reasons for optimism in these dreary times. 'It is a bright spot, insofar as we have all been saying for years that a lower exchange rate was probably a necessary condition for a decent rebalancing of the economy, away from an excessive reliance on consumer spending, and towards exports,' he says.</p> <p>Certainly, amid the pessimism, industry surveys show confidence holding up better in the manufacturing sector than among battered retailers or estate agents. The latest quarterly assessment by EEF, the engineering employers' federation, shows that its members are still seeing strong export orders, helping to offset the collapse in domestic demand.</p> <p>For several years, economists - and Bank of England governor Mervyn King - have warned that sterling is overvalued, making exporters' lives extremely tough and helping the pound in consumers' pockets to buy more cut-price goods from overseas.</p> <p>Presenting the Bank's quarterly inflation report last month, King said it was 'not surprising that a country which has seen rapid growth of domestic demand and a large trade deficit, to which we've pointed for many years, that at some point that would lead to an adjustment in the exchange rate - and I think that's probably what's happened'.</p> <p>He predicted that the weaker exchange rate would help to boost exports, and 'rebalance' an economy that has been skewed towards consumer spending. The question is whether, after decades of grinding attrition, Britain's manufacturers have the skills, the capacity or the financing to rise to their more competitive position.</p> <p>David Frost, director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, says manufacturing has been unloved for many years, as employment in the sector has slipped from more than five million in the early 1980s to under three million today: 'It's not just this government; this has gone on since the 1980s. There's been this absolute fascination with the services sector. I have argued for a long time that the economy is out of balance. We need a strong manufacturing base.' </p> <p>Brown and his colleagues could hardly have chosen a better city for their first cabinet day trip. Birmingham offers a microcosm of the shifting character of Britain's economy. Its biggest employer was once the Longbridge plant, home of British car brand Rover. In the 1970s, it was the backdrop for bitter battles between employers and unions, led by Derek Robinson, or 'Red Robbo', as he was known. Thirty years later, as Longbridge tottered, Stephen Byers, the then trade and industry secretary, desperate to save the last British-owned carmaker, backed an ill-fated rescue plan by a consortium known as the Phoenix Four.</p> <p>Rover finally collapsed in 2005, and Longbridge closed with the loss of 6,000 jobs. As if to underline the changing power balance in the world economy of the 21st century, the remnants of the firm were bought up by Chinese company Nanjing Automotive, which shipped much of the production line to China. Longbridge reopened this year, to produce high-specification MG sports cars, but the plant's new owner expects to employ 250 people, a far cry from its mass production heyday.</p> <p>Even as Birmingham's reputation as the home of British carmaking waned, however, the city experienced an impressive regeneration, with smart canal-side apartments and the striking Bull Ring shopping centre, home to branches of Selfridges and Harvey Nichols.</p> <p>This tale has been repeated all over the country, as manufacturers have found themselves unable to compete with cheaper rivals in China, India and other emerging markets, or with the technical prowess of Germany and Japan, which have remained formidable exporters. </p> <p>If the cheaper pound is really to prompt a manufacturing renaissance then it will take time. There are not hundreds of mothballed factories waiting for someone to switch on the lights and start the machines humming again; an army of skilled workers has found other roles and top-flight graduates have often aspired to City salaries, instead of running a business making widgets.</p> <p>So far, there has been little evidence of strengthening exports, despite the fact that the pound has been declining for almost a year. But Martin Weale, director of the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, says history suggests there will eventually be significant economic benefits.</p> <p>'The experience of earlier exchange-rate adjustments has been that, while the timing of an export boost is not certain, market forces do work in the end,' he says. 'The recent fall of sterling adds to the competitive edge which Britain has gained.' He says that each 10 per cent decline in sterling tends to increase economic output by half a percentage point the following year, so the 15 per cent depreciation we have now had should give GDP a much-needed 0.75 per cent boost in 2009.</p> <p>This could be a crucial extra prop to demand over the next couple of years, as other sources of growth, such as consumer spending, crumble in the face of the house price crash. Certainly, there are already many quiet manufacturing success stories, often under the wing of foreign ownership.</p> <p>It may be good news for exporters, but the shift in the pound also complicates the dilemma facing King and his colleagues at the Bank. After cutting interest rates three times in the early months of the credit crunch, they have refrained from making further reductions, despite the flood of bad news, fearing that inflation, which has shot up to 4.4 per cent - more than double the government's 2 per cent target - will run out of control.</p> <p>Sterling's slide adds an extra complication, because it will push up the price of buying imported goods and raw materials, which could boost inflation yet further in the short term. Clothing retailers have already warned that if the pound continues to weaken they may have to follow food stores in making sharp price increases over the next 12 months.</p> <p>However, higher costs only become inflationary if retailers can make those price rises stick, and the more dovish members of the Monetary Policy Committee - led by economist David Blanchflower - believe the economy is already slowing so rapidly that inflation will not take hold.</p> <p>After the pound plunged out of the European exchange rate mechanism in autumn 1992, its value dropped sharply, but inflation remained contained, because the economy was already deep into recession.</p> <p>Weale argues that the decline in the pound will be better medicine for UK plc than the cuts in interest rates demanded by many business groups. 'The economy needs an upturn in export demand rather than a revival of consumer demand and the prospects for this are considerably better than they were only a few weeks ago,' he says.</p> <p>With the downturn that began in the US housing market increasingly manifesting itself in the euro zone, and a growing number of emerging economies contributing to the tough backdrop Darling is so concerned about, any improvement in manufacturers' fortunes is likely to be gradual and hard won. But if the decline in sterling is really the long-term adjustment King and others hope for, perhaps for once the Square Mile may not be the most exciting place in Britain's economic landscape.</p> <h2>North east optimist: but help is needed</h2> <p>Mohan Emmanuel of biotechnology firm Implants International, which makes replacement knees and hips, says it's about time firms like his won more attention from the government. 'Manufacturing for the last 15 years hasn't been considered sexy: the ethos of the service-driven economy has been at the forefront of everyone's minds.'</p> <p>Employing 36 people in the north east, Emmanuel says a weaker pound would certainly help him to sell more implants to the US and European markets. 'It's a good thing for Britain: please God may it be maintained,' he says.</p> <p>'Over the last years, the weakness of the dollar has had a significant effect on our stability vis-a-vis our US sales. The weakening of the pound against the dollar will help - and against the euro, too.'</p> <p>Despite the slowdown in the US and Europe, he anticipates continued strong growth. 'Our products are in a market that's more or less inflation-proof, and demand-proof, because people are living longer. Hips, knees, elbows, wrists are growing by 15 per cent a year in most countries. The market is very buoyant.'</p> <p>Nevertheless, he says manufacturers would benefit from government help. 'There used to be assistance for buying new capital equipment - high-productivity machines, and so on. That was abolished. All the rhetoric is not going to deliver in terms of manufacturing, unless there is tangible assistance at the grassroots.' Otherwise, he says, there will be little manufacturing left.</p> <p>Implants International is keen to exploit new markets in the developing world. It currently does all its design, development and manufacturing on-site; but it has just signed a deal which should eventually allow the manufacture of some of its products on licence in China, for distribution throughout the Pacific Rim. 'We are struggling to compete in China with products that are manufactured here: we need to be there,' Emmanuel says.</p> <h2>Burden not boon: importer suffers</h2> <p>For Ian Malcolm, managing director of German-owned gasket maker Elring Klinger, based near Redcar in the north east of England, the cheaper pound is not a boon, but a burden. Almost all his raw materials - mainly steel - are imported from Europe, and priced in euros.</p> <p>'We're suffering quite severely with the exchange rate: it will probably cost us \u00a31m over the next 12 months, and when you're talking about a \u00a312m turnover business, that's quite serious.'</p> <p>Nevertheless, Malcolm believes that a weaker currency will eventually be good for UK plc as a whole. 'On a macro scale, we will start to be more competitive again. A lot of our customers are demanding low-cost production as part of the service we offer, and we're almost becoming that low-cost manufacturer.'</p> <p>Like many other UK manufacturers which have adapted to survive in the increasingly tough global economy in recent years, Elring Klinger has had to reduce the size of its workforce, from 280 in 2002 to 130 today. 'If you go back to the times of Red Robbo, [the militant trade union leader] at Longbridge, it was very much jobs for the boys and jobs for life. But it wasn't the real world.'</p> <p>However, despite competition from cheaper locations, such as India, Malcolm says he has hung on to customers who prefer to source components from nearby: 'If you're buying from India, you've either got to air freight at great expense, or it's six weeks at sea at the very least. If our customer has a quality concern, we can get somebody into their plant in four or five hours.'</p> <p>Asked whether he looks to the government's new manufacturing strategy for help, he says: 'We won't hold our breath.' His main gripe with the policies of the past decade is the national minimum wage. When first introduced, he was paying above it, but since then he says it has begun to bite, raising his labour costs. 'How can you expect employers to match a 70 per cent increase in wage costs over the last seven years? It's unrealistic. It's making the UK less profitable.'</p> <h2>Uphill struggle: Strong euro pushes up the price of materials for maker of folded bikes</h2> <p>Will Butler-Adams, managing director of London-based Brompton Bicycle, believes there are reasons to be optimistic about manufacturing. 'If you're a British manufacturer who is involved in something which involves intellectual property, which involves a distinctive, unique selling point, which uses really clever engineering, then there's no reason why you shouldn't be really successful.'</p> <p>However, he has been forced to take drastic action this year as the price of the raw materials for the folding bikes Brompton makes has jumped. 'For the first time in our history, we've had to add a 7.5 per cent surcharge for our European customers,' he says.</p> <p>'We're buying quite a lot of our raw materials priced in euros, so we get hit by the fact that these parts are becoming more expensive. We then put a 5 per cent price increase across all of our markets.'</p> <p>Brompton has absorbed most of the rise in the cost of commodities, by accepting shrinking margins; but Butler-Adams says the financial pressures were so severe that he could not avoid asking for a 'contribution' from distributors. 'It's knocked our bottom line by about \u00a3200,000. Knowing that we're taking the brunt, they don't mind.'</p> <p>He believes the decline in sterling will be of little help. 'I don't think the pound is going to make much difference. The thing that matters is finding really good engineers, or really good designers.'</p> <p>Although the slowdown is beginning to bite in Europe, strong sales in emerging markets - including South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore - are helping to boost Brompton's performance. 'In terms of our actual market, we have seen Europe slow; but in Asia, our market has remained very, very strong. The fact that the product is manufactured in Britain - in London, even - has a real value in Asia: they really enjoy that.'</p> <p>He expects to maintain a healthy pace of expansion for the forseeable future. 'We're in a unique niche market, which is growing rapidly. We expect to grow by 25 per cent for the next few years.'</p>",
  "<p>It is a television phenomenon that is set to become Britain's latest lucrative cultural export, a specialist show that reinvented itself as mainstream family entertainment, winning a Sunday-night audience measuring more than eight million. </p> <p>Top Gear, a programme about three middle-aged men messing around in cars, has already turned its presenters, including Jeremy Clarkson, into household names, and now it has become a vehicle for the BBC's global ambitions, a 'superbrand' executives plan to turn into an international money-spinner. </p> <p>Last week bosses at the corporation's commercial arm, BBC Worldwide, tasked with dreaming up new ways of making money from programmes, announced plans to take the show on the road, charging fans \u00a3105 a ticket to watch Clarkson and fellow presenters Richard Hammond and James May front a live version of the series in Birmingham and London. More exotic locations, including Johannesburg, Sydney and Hong Kong await, and with at least 10 shows planned in each city, TV's most popular trio will bring their trademark brand of self-deprecating humour live to a total audience of more than 300,000. </p> <p>The overseas push forms part of an aggressive expansion drive by BBC Worldwide, once a small operation that produced videos of the corporation's most popular shows, but now a commercial juggernaut that sells formats overseas, launching magazines and even buying up the travel guide brand Lonely Planet. Worldwide made \u00a3118m last year and is now worth more than \u00a31bn, prompting complaints from the BBC's critics that it is using licence-fee money to crush smaller competitors. But like X Factor and Strictly Come Dancing, Top Gear is expected to become a worldwide hit, demonstrating that nowadays no one does popular entertainment quite like the Brits.</p> <p>Top Gear is already screened in more than 100 countries and a spin-off magazine, the country's best-selling motoring title, publishes 23 editions around the world. Other merchandise, including DVDs, CDs, computer games and a Top Gear toy and gift range, make it one of the BBC's most profitable shows. But exploiting the global market will increase those profits tenfold. American channel NBC has commissioned a pilot that will be made by BBC Worldwide's new Los Angeles production office; and Australians, who already receive the British version of Top Gear, will soon get a domestic equivalent produced by a home-grown company part-owned by BBC Worldwide. Not bad for a BBC2 show created 30 years ago as an early evening mid-week filler fronted by old BBC hands, including newsreader Angela Rippon. </p> <p>'What's interesting about Top Gear is that everyone thinks it's about cars' says Wayne Garvie, BBC Worldwide's director of content and production. 'It isn't. It's about men and their relationships and that's a universal theme.' The plain-speaking Clarkson describes it simply as 'ambitious but shit' and his old friend, executive producer Andy Wilman, a former Top Gear presenter, is equally modest. 'It's about men dicking around. It's Last of the Summer Wine with cars,' he says. </p> <p>'A lot of factual TV is about how to pay off your mortgage or buy a house because there's an obsession with being useful,' he explains. 'We just fuck about. It's a bit of downtime. It's got a Friday evening feel to it on a Sunday evening. It adds another hour to your weekend.' </p> <p>Top Gear has evolved into a gentle television comedy where the cars are the props, and the presenters 'ad lib' in front of a studio audience of petrolheads. 'There was a point where we wondered if we actually had enough cars on the programme,' admits a former BBC executive who helped to relaunch the show. </p> <p>Since moving from mid-week to a Sunday-evening slot, it has attracted a new audience - now 42 per cent of viewers are women who feel comfortable watching a show that can be laddish without being overtly aggressive or macho, and the presenters' ability to laugh at themselves has managed to attract a family audience, an impressive feat in an age when kids rarely watch the same shows as their parents.</p> <p>'It's got that 1950s Ovaltine feel about it,' says Wilman. 'Mothers like it because the kids watch it, and young boys like it because they know they're not going to be David Beckham or Lewis Hamilton, but they could grow up to be an overweight bloke in jeans driving fast cars.'</p> <p>In the 1990s the show was relatively successful on BBC2, regularly pulling in up to 1.5 million viewers and even continued after Clarkson decided he was bored with cars and wanted to pursue other projects, later recalling that he had test-driven a car and simply couldn't think of anything to say about it. In 2002, when Jane Root, then the controller of BBC2, ordered a radical makeover in the face of falling viewing figures, Clarkson was persuaded to return, partly because his BBC chat show had flopped, and it was moved to a new Sunday-night slot, with two new presenters and an hour-long format. </p> <p>'I thought we'd die a death,' says one former BBC executive. 'But it immediately doubled its audience.' It continued to grow, and now attracts eight million, well over a third of all available viewers. That was achieved by broadening the show's appeal far beyond its core audience, mainly by wooing women. 'We genuinely thought we could attract a female audience because the show was funny', says the former BBC executive. </p> <p>As so often in TV, the current line-up, on which much of the show's success rests, owes more to accident than design. Producers wanted to recruit a female presenter, and her agent set up a meeting on the condition they also met another client, Richard Hammond, a former local radio presenter working on an obscure cable channel. 'I thought \"you must be joking!\"' remembers the former BBC executive; but Hammond was allowed to make some short films for a Top Gear spin-off and when he auditioned for the main show he was an instant hit. 'We interviewed lots of high-profile motoring journalists and half of them were scared shitless of Jeremy,' says the former BBC exec. 'The remarkable thing about Richard is he was naturally funny and he took the piss out of Clarkson, which Jeremy loved.' </p> <p>Unlike Hammond, May was initially reluctant to return to a show he had briefly hosted before, until he was told he would be free to be himself, perfecting his persona as 'the ale-drinking older man with the classic car in his shed'.</p> <p>'James had a 14-year-old Bentley at the time,' the ex-BBC man recalls. 'At the audition he said \"I've found out if you spend \u00a350 at Tesco you get \u00a35 of free petrol. Now I can drive anywhere I like; the problem is my house is full of rotting food\". Everyone in the room laughed, Jeremy laughed. That landed him the job.'</p> <p>The decision to record the series in front of a live studio audience also proved to be a masterstroke. Initially they had to pay a company to recruit guests, including women who were placed strategically in front of the cameras. Now there is a three-year waiting list for tickets. 'People look back and say it was bound to be a success, but there was nothing to suggest that in the pilots.' </p> <p>'I'm just a facilitator,' says Wilman. 'The engine room is Jeremy. I'm not just blowing smoke up his arse. Its rare you get a presenter with that level of involvement and that much editorial nous.' </p> <p>Clarkson and his co-stars publicised their world tour last week in typically bombastic fashion by driving a tank across Tower Bridge, and they will be rewarded handsomely if the brand travels well overseas. Hammond and James, who negotiated new salaries following a brief ruckus over the amount they were paid, will get extra money; but Clarkson and Wilman stand to make even more. </p> <p>BBC Worldwide acquired a stake in their company, Bedder 6, last year as part of a ground-breaking deal that will see the duo share half of the profits from the show's international expansion. That has also been criticised by some observers, who fail to see why presenters should line their pockets on the back of a brand built with licence-fee money. The answer, in part, is that it helps the BBC retain key talent, and similar deals could be struck with other presenters. 'It's no secret people were after us to leave and it was one way of us staying,' says Wilman. 'If it's going to be a brand all around the world we get some payment for the work we do on that, but there's no extra strain on BBC resources.'</p> <p>'None of us saw this coming,' says Wilman. 'We couldn't have dreamed it.' But he admits that maintaining Top Gear's success will be a hard slog. 'People will get bored of us. We'll wear ourselves out. It gets harder and harder to think of new ideas.' The bigger question, as with all shows whose success depends on the popularity of its presenters, is whether it could continue should they decide to leave. Wilman, for one, believes it would. 'The Richard, Jeremy and James line-up is a tour de force but it would survive without them. We are like stewards for a while and then it becomes like Doctor Who. It will regenerate.'</p> <h2>The BBC's spirit of enterprise</h2> <p>BBC Worldwide, the commercial arm of the BBC, made pre-tax profits of \u00a3118m in 2007-08, a 17 per cent rise on the previous financial year. Its turnover grew by 13 per cent to \u00a3916m and it is now valued at more than \u00a31bn, making it more valuable than ITV's in-house production arm. </p> <p>It is the UK's biggest exporter of television programmes, selling successful BBC shows, including Strictly Come Dancing, to overseas markets. </p> <p>It is also the country's third-largest magazine publisher, with 52 titles, including Radio Times and Top Gear, selling 90m copies a year. </p> <p>Worldwide runs the BBC's portfolio of international channels, including BBC World News, which are available in 285m homes.

  "<p>After a week that was supposed to 'relaunch' Labour on a path to better political health, Gordon Brown heads into his second conference season as leader with more bad blood being shed around him than at any time since he became Prime Minister. On first impressions, and after little more than a year in the job, the game might already appear to be up. His party is at war with itself - as proved today by union leader Derek Simpson's extraordinary outburst against Foreign Secretary David Miliband - and seems completely unable to focus on the external enemy, David Cameron's Tories.</p> <p>The Conservatives, in their own state of desperation exactly a year ago as Brown wallowed in his long-forgotten political honeymoon, cannot believe their good fortune. 'We do not need to do anything at all. Just sit and enjoy the show,' said one Tory frontbencher.</p> <p>There will be another outbreak of internal Labour strife this week as the TUC inflicts a series of bruising defeats on a badly weakened Prime Minister, demanding a windfall tax on energy companies, a new progressive income tax system to punish the rich, an easing of pay discipline at a time when inflation is going through the roof, and a huge increase in spending on council homes.</p> <p>Dave Prentis, general secretary of Britain's largest union, Unison, and a voice of relative moderation in the union movement, set the scene for what promises to be an ugly congress, leading to an equally ugly gathering of the entire Labour party in two weeks' time. 'In everything that has happened our government has lost its way,' he said. Labour voters and trade unionists, he argued, were 'fed up to the back teeth', with a leadership that never seemed to act in their interests, while pandering to big business.</p> <p>Today TUC leader Brendan Barber weighs in by publishing a report trashing Brown's period as Chancellor and Prime Minister, which it says has failed to deliver on the objective of most Labour supporters - narrowing the income gap between rich and poor. Instead it accuses the government under Brown's stewardship of creating a 'golden age for the rich', adding: 'The hands-off policies of recent times are becoming increasingly difficult to justify ... There are clear signs that we have reached the limit of public tolerance of a society skewed so heavily in favour of the rich, irrespective of the impact on others.'</p> <p>It is not just the direction of policy that divides the party and angers MPs. The very operation of government seems to be dysfunctional under Brown. Behind the scenes, a virtual breakdown of relations between the Treasury and Number 10 (and the Prime Minister and his Chancellor, following Alistair Darling's doom-laden economic analysis) has prevented any coherent response aimed at helping the less well-off deal with the pending global recession. </p> <p>Everywhere, Labour's personal rivalries and policy differences thwart decisive action. Last week the Treasury, which had cautioned against the introduction of a stamp duty holiday to help first-time buyers, found itself overruled by Number 10 and on Tuesday one was announced - to widespread lack of enthusiasm. </p> <p>By Thursday, Brown's modest economic relaunch was in further disarray when his advisers admitted that negotiations with energy companies to extract \u00a3100 a head to help people on low incomes with fuel bills had broken down. 'This relaunch has already failed and it has not really started yet,' said one former cabinet minister gloomily.</p> <p>Calls to government departments in recent days to ask about measures to help homeowners with fuel bills - due next week - have revealed virtual paralysis in Whitehall. Number 10, meanwhile, is failing to give a lead as it conducts its own feuds. Stephen Carter, the PR man drafted in by Brown to sharpen his image and presentation, is involved in a vicious turf war with suggestions that he is about to be ousted and may be offered a peerage. Officials who are supposed to give information to the press instead seek information themselves from journalists: 'What have you heard? We don't know what is going on. We can't say if it is definitely coming next week.' </p> <p>Against this background, it was predictable that Charles Clarke, the combustible former Home Secretary, should try to fuel the flames by calling publicly, for the first time, for Brown to go 'with honour'. Clarke coupled this suggestion with an admission that no one in the cabinet was ready yet to strike against the Prime Minister. Less predictable was the response across the party. Clarke's remarks focused minds not just on the scale of the crisis - but the absence of an answer in the form of an alternative candidate for the leadership. One senior Labour MP remarked: 'What Charles did was to show that we have a crisis - but he also showed we have no one else who can solve it for us.'</p> <p>Many in the union movement and on Labour's centre-left were talking a few weeks ago of launching moves to oust Brown from office if they could persuade a credible figure such as Alan Johnson, the Health Secretary, to stand. Now they have swung back behind Brown - at least for the time being. Johnson has refused, thus far, to show what one union source described as 'even the smallest bit of leadership leg'. And on the right, David Miliband's mid-summer display of his own ambition has failed to generate the backing he would have hoped for.</p> <p>For Labour MPs, the benefits of plunging into a messy and divisive leadership contest at a time when the public expects government to be governing are not clear. Yesterday Andy Hornby, head of the UK's largest mortgage provider, HBOS, predicted that it would be 18 months before house prices would start to rise again. One backbencher said: 'Just now, in this economic climate, [a leadership contest] would seem and look irresponsible. There is a real risk that it would do us more harm than good.' </p> <p>Prentis, speaking on behalf of Unison's 800,000 public sector members, summed up the current feeling across much of the party by insisting that despite everything Brown should be given more time, not because he deserves it, but because there is no alternative. Changing leader now, Prentis said, would make 'no difference whatsoever'. 'Who has got more experience than the current Prime Minister? Who could we put in who is going to come in with the panacea to cure all these problems? They are not around. The problems are too serious.'</p> <p>If the events of recent weeks are anything to go by, however, there is scant evidence that Brown and his government will use the stay of execution to good effect. This week, Labour is due to announce a deal with the energy companies under which home owners on lower incomes will receive help with insulation.</p> <p>But it is only expected to be worth between \u00a3300m and \u00a31bn. The Local Government Association calculates that up to \u00a35bn needs to be provided over the next few years for the scheme to work. Such small-scale assistance is likely only to further anger Labour backbenchers, around 130 of whom are now backing the unions' demands for a windfall tax on the energy companies. The windfall tax issue is dividing government from top to bottom. While the Treasury and Number 10 insist that the measure is still a runner, other ministers admit that this seems to be a holding line to get the party through the conference season. John Hutton, the Blairite Business Secretary and bane of the left, would, friends believe, be prepared to resign if the plan, which he believes would drive companies and investment in new, more efficient technology abroad, were approved. There are also continuing tensions about how to assist the mortgage market, with Number 10 backing action on a \u00a3100bn extension of mortgage-backed securities while the Treasury and Bank of England remain opposed.</p> <p>Labour MPs in marginal seats and union leaders trying to justify their financial links with the party to their members want some drastic, decisive action, not piecemeal, disappointingly limited measures. Increasingly, they cite the boldness of moves being made in the US to help home buyers there as evidence of how to tackle a crisis with firm responses.</p> <p>US Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson was last night poised to announce an emergency taxpayer-backed rescue plan for giant mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as Washington battles to prevent the year-long credit crunch claiming fresh victims on Wall Street. </p> <p>News of the mooted rescue emerged as another regional American bank, the eleventh so far this year, collapsed in the face of losses from the housing crisis. The Silver State Bank, in Nevada, which until recently counted Andrew McCain, son of the Republican presidential candidate John McCain, on its board, was shut down by federal regulators on Friday.</p> <p>By the time MPs return to Westminster next month, the clock will be ticking again. By then higher winter fuel bills will be arriving and MPs postbags will be filling up with complaints from angry constituents. In October or early November, Labour could face another humiliating Scottish byelection reverse - this time in Glenrothes - at the hands of the resurgent Scottish Nationalists. Defeat in Brown's own political backyard would unleash another bout of speculation over the Prime Minister's future.</p> <p>Prentis and other senior party members have decided to give the Prime Minister time - but they will not wait for ever. 'We will review things at the end of the year,' he observed. 'It is a very interesting situation.'</p>",
  "<p>Walking through the hammering and banging that are the preparations of the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum's imminent 'Cold War Modern' exhibition, I found myself recalling a childhood memory of the Tornados' 1962 novelty hit 'Telstar'. Perhaps the first record named after a communications satellite, it had a radiophonic character, like lyrical static from an old analogue phone line. It caught the mood of the period, somewhere between optimism and fear. And rather technophiliac.</p> <p>Now that global plagues, terrorism and meteorological calamity have replaced the Red Army as threats, the Cold War period suddenly seems almost benign. Much rather a T-54 tank on our lawn than al-Qaeda on the flightdeck. Germans call it 'Ostalgie', an irrational love of the workers' cacotopia that was Honecker's East Germany. East Berlin stank of Russian petrol and had cardboard Czech shoes in flyblown shop windows. People ate coal. As if to confirm the irrationality of consumers, just as soon as the East Germans achieved the liberation they craved, some started to yearn for the symbols of repression.</p> <p>The Lives of Others, Florian von Donnersmarck's meticulously propped East Berlin romance, was released in April 2007. Two months later, the Ostel opened in the city's fashionable Mitte district. The Ostel is styled 'Der DDR Design Hotel', and its rooms are full of refurbished Communist-era junk, acceptable now to fully ironised stylehounds. </p> <p>It's often called a Stasi hotel, but accommodation with the Staatsicherheits Polizei did not offer fast check-out facilities. The hotel has a dormitory called Pioneer Camp. The Ostshop is an in-house Konsum store selling bad plastic toys. Trabants are available for guests to drive. Magazines in the lobby carry Louis Vuitton ads showing Gorbachev slumped in a limo by the Berlin Wall. The Cold War has become collectible.</p> <p>It's thought that Don Juan Manuel was the first person to use the expression Cold War. His 'guerra fria' referred to the antagonism between Islam and Christian Europe. And that was in the 13th century. In 1938 Nation magazine referred to Hitler's Cold War. Orwell used the expression in 1945. It was popularised by Walter Lippmann's 1947 articles. In an age of sinister metaphors, the Cold War was what blew across the Iron Curtain. It began on VJ-Day, 15 August 1945, and lasted until 1962, when U-2 spyplanes found nuclear missiles on Cuba. Or did it end with Prague, 1968? Or Vietnam, 1975? Possibly Berlin, 1989. President George Bush Sr said in 1992 that the greatest American achievement was to end it. He spoke too soon.</p> <p>The American response to the stand-off was to create a fabulous world in which life could be improved by ever-increased consumption of goods. Tom Wolfe called it the American Century. American family cars sucked fuel like an Atlas launcher on lift-off. Modern furniture found a vast market in the millions of homes built in the Fifties. Magazines ran features on 'air-supported domes for all-year swimming'. </p> <p>Architecture and design became known as mid-century modern. Morris Lapidus's Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami Beach (1954), with its boomerang shapes, was at least as typical as Mies van der Rohe's Seagram Building (1958), with its straight lines. There was an 800-cover dining room with a hydraulic dance floor. Guests were so swamped with luxuriosa that Lapidus said the effect was like being carried on a silver platter. Elvis liked the interior man-made mountain and waterfall. Miss Universe was staged there. </p> <p>For every Bauhaus chair in a corporate lobby there were a hell of a lot more Barcaloungers. If furniture could be obese, a Barcalounger - with built-in massagers and heaters - was obese. At home, Lippmann's Cold War became America's 'full-blooded, go-to-hell, belly-rubbing wahoo-yahoo youthful rampage', as Wolfe had it. Asked to explain his aesthetic, Harley Earl of General Motors, the man who gave the world cars inspired by intercontinental ballistic missles, said: 'I want that line to have a duflunky, to come across, have a little hook in it, and then do a rashoom or a zong.'</p> <p>And then there was Europe. The West Germans coped with increasing prosperity by applying Bauhaus design principles to consumer goods: Dieter Rams's austerity for Braun electrical products would only have been acceptable in a culture where alternatives were becoming available. Meanwhile, the Ossis (East Germans) had trouble making enamel buckets. Soviet-sector product design was charmingly bad. The Soyuzelektropribor television receiver had wobbly legs and loose knobs. That's if you could receive television.</p> <p>Yet Soviet-controlled Europe was curiously ambitious about consumerism. In 1959, at the American National Exhibition in Moscow, Vice-President Nixon sought to humiliate Khrushchev with an American dream kitchen. The pictures are priceless: fridge as symbol of ideological victory. For Eisenhower's visit to Moscow, Khrushchev commissioned the Soviet Union's sole celebrity designer, Yuri Soloviev, to make an 8,000 horsepower speedboat. 'She's bourgeois... but I like her,' the Russian said. Those Zil limos favoured by the apparatchiks were in fact cargo-cult US Packards. Late in the Cold War, Concordski aped the Anglo-French prototype.</p> <p>What are the other themes at the V&amp;A? Mawkish socialist realism versus studio modernism. The green glass Lever Building of Park Avenue up against brutish Stalinist classicism. Everywhere, it seems, molecules and atoms inspired designers. There were the Atomiums and telecom towers: Moscow's Ostankino of 1967, Berlin's from 1969. There's the ever-present rhetoric of military futurism. Ken Adam's sets for The Ipcress File and early Bond do paranoia nicely. </p> <p>But this infatuation with military sources may also have begun in America: Charles Eames learnt about moulding plywood from army medical corps splints, and the Harvard-trained architect Eliot Noyes's adroit styling of IBM's image would not have been possible without US military technology. Back in the DDR, Bauhaus austerity suited autocracy well, but it also did well in Manhattan.</p> <p>In the West, designers were meant to excite demand; in the East, they were meant to do no such thing. Walking around 'Cold War Modern', you realise how advertising and design were handmaidens in Europe and America. In the West, design and the culture of waste were inseparable. The single most affecting image is the Tower of Zinc Buckets from Wroclaw's 1948 'Exhibition of Regained Lands'. No Madison Avenue USP here. </p> <p>It's compellingly interesting material - within living memory, yet as dated as the Regency - but the stage army of academics who contribute to the catalogue (people who begin paragraphs with expressions such as 'I will argue') do not persuade me that it's a coherent subject. In parts, it's more like a Bulgarian car boot sale. For example: besides his IBM products, Noyes also designed the interior for the bizjet of Raleigh Warner, the Mobil boss for whom he also created a global stereotype of filling stations. Propaganda at the pump! </p> <p>But Noyes flying his plane through the Connecticut skies, drinking his cocktails in Country Club Road, New Canaan (one of the US's wealthiest areas) and driving his Porsche or his T-bird or his Land Rover to play golf does not have much in common with a toiling member of the All Union Association of Technical Draftsmen in the Volkseigener Betrieb Sachsenring Automobilwerke Zwickau at work on a Trabi.</p> <p>As always in design exhibitions organised by art historians, there's more concern with foot-noting and point-scoring than engaging with the material. What does it mean? Why should we care? Exactly why is East German Tupperware in the V&amp;A? Why be afraid to say? Why structure it as a book? On the evidence here, the quality of the American and European achievement is far superior. And I don't just mean in modular kitchen storage. It's an ambition of the organisers to establish Cold War Modern as a new style-label, bravely to adjust our perceptions of schisms that might or might not have happened in architecture and design after 1945. They don't want to fetishise designers as personalities, but fetishise a historical moment instead.</p> <p>The different cultures do, however, have one thing in common: in The End of Ideology, published in 1960 and conceived at the chilly depths of the Cold War, Daniel Bell said: 'Capitalism... is a system wherein man exploits man... and Communism is vice versa.' Capitalism simply seems to do it better.</p> <p>Oh, and by the way. The greatest legacy of the Cold War? Not, I think a Trabi, drenched in ironic cuteness. Rather, it's the internet, a system designed to secure free movement of the US command structure's data in the event of a Soviet missile attack. They thought it was really going to happen. It still might.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Cold War Modern: Design 1945-70 runs from 25 Sep-11 Jan 2009 at the V&amp;A, London SW1</p>",

  "<p>Any hopes of an Indian summer were in tatters yesterday after severe rain continued to batter the country amid warnings that the remnants of Hurricane Hannah were on their way.</p> <p>Parts of north-east England, North Yorkshire and Derbyshire were issued with severe flood warnings as the heaviest of the rains moved north-east from Wales, where one teenage girl died on Friday night.</p> <p>More than 200 flood warnings or watches covered huge parts of the UK, and police in Northumberland and North Yorkshire had to rescue several motorists from their cars.</p> <p>Among the worst affected areas was Morpeth, Northumberland, where up to 40 homes close to the River Wansbeck had to be evacuated yesterday as water levels rose. A police spokeswoman said heavy rain had turned the normally peaceful waters into a fast-flowing torrent. </p> <p>The worst of the rain is expected to clear in most places throughout today and tomorrow, bringing predicted temperatures of 23C in London on Tuesday. But these glimpses of sunshine will be short-lived. By Wednesday a weather system brought on by Hurricane Hannah, which is working its way down the east coast of America, is expected to hit the UK, bringing more rain and misery. 'A band of rain and strong winds will spread across the country affecting everywhere by Thursday,' said Neil Armstrong, a Met Office forecaster.</p> <p>The continuing wet weather washes away any chance of the prolonged, dry September many had been hoping for following the seventh-wettest summer on record. A forecast issued by the Met Office at the beginning of the year had been for a 'typical British summer', with rain at times but sunnier days in between. Instead, last month saw the fewest hours of sunshine of any August on record. </p> <p>Forecasters say more floods in the weeks ahead could cause untold misery for householders as more rain falls on already saturated ground. </p> <p>Some parts of south-west England have seen more rainfall in 24 hours than they would typically see in the whole of September. </p> <p>An Environment Agency spokesman said: 'The threat of flooding is likely to increase. We cannot say how serious it might be until the rain has stopped falling.' </p> <p>Yesterday's deluge led to the cancellation of race meetings and agricultural shows, while train services were in chaos. Arriva Trains Wales was advising passengers not to travel after the severe floods on Friday and early yesterday. Passengers travelling between Scotland and London on the east coast line in both directions were hit by cancellations and delays of up to three hours.</p> <p>The severe weather has claimed five lives. A teenager from Thamesmead, south London, died in Wales after becoming trapped in a 4x4 in swollen river waters on Friday. She was travelling along forestry roads above the Llyn Brianne reservoir in a convoy of three 4x4s when her vehicle overturned at a river ford. </p> <p>Emergency first aid was administered by two off-duty paramedics in the convoy. Another man drove for help. Two others escaped from the car. The remaining party took the girl down the valley in a vehicle where they met emergency services, but she was pronounced dead after arrival at hospital. </p> <p>Earlier in the day a man and a woman died when they crashed into a tree as they drove through torrential rain in Plymouth, Devon. A 42-year-old Sheffield man was killed when the Kawasaki motorbike he was riding hit a tree branch on the A66 near Scotch Corner, in North Yorkshire, on Friday afternoon, and a builder was killed in Stroud by a mudslide while working in a trench at a construction site.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown will seek to distract attention from the looming recession tomorrow, as he launches a national strategy for manufacturing at a cabinet away-day in the West Midlands.</p> <p>With the City laying off thousands of staff, and the slide in house prices forcing consumers to tighten their belts, Brown and his colleagues are pinning their hopes on an industrial renaissance.</p> <p>The Prime Minister will be flanked by Chancellor Alistair Darling, business minister John Hutton, and universities minister John Denham, as he promises to streamline business support, boost skills, and encourage innovation.</p> <p>But David Frost, director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said he expected little from this latest plank in Brown's economic 'relaunch' and pointed out that the government has for many years neglected manufacturers in favour of the City. 'There's been this absolute fascination with the services sector since the Eighties,' he said.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Department for Business and Enterprise said: 'We are committed to ensuring that manufacturing has the right long-term framework of support to emerge from the global slowdown stronger and fitter than ever.'</p> <p>Exporters have battled against the strength of sterling for a decade, but with the pound now down almost 15 per cent against the currencies of Britain's major trading partners, analysts believe improved global competitiveness is one of the few reasons for optimism.</p> <p>However, analysts say it will take at least a year for cheaper British goods to improve demand; and even an impressive performance from exporters will not stop Britain sliding into recession.</p>",
  "<p>In Woody Allen's film Sleeper, the owner of a health food store called The Happy Carrot goes into hospital for a routine ulcer operation and wakes up 200 years later after a long snooze in a tank of liquid nitrogen. A bewildered Miles Monroe finds that society has changed considerably while he's been asleep, not least in its attitude to health. Contrary to what people thought in 1973, scientists have discovered that tobacco, cream pies and fried food are all good for you. </p> <p>Would wine feature on the same list if Allen were updating the movie now, setting it in 2208 instead of 2173? Health-wise, it doesn't belong in the same category as a jam doughnut or a packet of crisps, but to listen to some politicians, doctors and neo-temperance organisations, consuming more than two glasses of wine a day puts your vital organs in jeopardy and makes you a danger to society. If these voices have their way, it's possible that wine won't have much of a future. It will be regarded as a class A drug, dealt on street corners to addicts desperate for a fix of merlot, shiraz or pinot grigio. </p> <p>I take a contrasting view. Perhaps over-optimistically, I like to imagine that, by 2208, wine will be regarded, worldwide, as the alcoholic beverage of choice: a healthy, diverse, complex, food-enhancing drink that reflects its origins faithfully and honestly.</p> <p>But let's shorten our time span to something more conceivable. Instead of looking ahead 200 years, let's predict what the wine world will be like in 2058. The surprisingly forward-thinking St James's merchant Berry Brothers &amp; Rudd published a pamphlet on this very subject earlier this year, inspired by a look at its bestsellers in 1958 - German, fortified and sweet wines - all of which are struggling today. \"Fifty years ago,\" argues its avuncular chairman, Simon Berry, \"it would have been unthinkable to take wine lessons 'virtually' or predict supermarket shelves would be stocked with wines from China, Brazil, India or New Mexico.\" Perish the thought, dear boy.</p> <p>Some of Berry Brothers' predictions sound ludicrous to me - there's more chance of Hull City winning the Premiership this season than of someone developing genetically modified vines \"grown hydroponically in off-shore floating vineyards\" - but the pinstriped gents talk a lot of sense too, highlighting climate change, new producing countries (China, Brazil and India), lightweight packaging, better fraud detection, the death of natural corks, spiralling fine wine prices and the creation of rootless, global wine brands as important issues over the next half-century. </p> <p>To these I would add ethical trading, access to water for irrigation, consolidation (of retailers, producers and importers), as well as the growth of natural, organic and biodynamic wine as an antidote to anodyne, mass-market products.</p> <p>One of these issues is arguably more important than the rest put together. Dr Richard Smart, the world's most famous and well-travelled vineyard consultant, has described climate change as \"the biggest factor ever to affect the wine industry\", and that includes phylloxera, the vine louse that wiped out 90% of Europe's vineyards at the end of the 19th century when it was imported to southern France on some native North American vine cuttings. \"Climate change could bring new, insect-borne diseases,\" he says, \"but we are also going to see major changes in the world's wine styles as producers adapt to increased temperatures.\"</p> <p>The climate scientist Gregory Jones of Southern Oregon University has calculated that average growing season temperatures in the world's 27 leading wine regions have increased by 1.3\u00b0C over the past 50 years. More worryingly for many wine producers, he predicts a further increase of 2\u00b0C by 2050, with even greater rises in parts of Australia, the Iberian peninsula, southern France, South Africa, Argentina, Chile, Sicily and California, all of which may struggle to make drinkable wine.</p> <p>Increased temperatures aren't necessarily a bad thing. In some cool climate areas, they are a bonus. In the Saar region of Germany, the aristocratic Egon M\u00fcller has witnessed the phenomenon in his celebrated Scharzhofberg vineyard. \"In my father's day, we had two bad and two catastrophic harvests per decade. But since 1987 we haven't had a single bad vintage. We are very happy about global warming.\" Warmer temperatures have also been a significant factor in the number of good to great vintages in Bordeaux, the world's largest fine wine area, since the early 1980s. </p> <p>In some places, however, higher temperatures will be disastrous. One French academic has predicted that, if trends continue, the Champagne region could be as hot as Valencia is now by the end of this century, and that huge swathes of the world's existing vineyard land will be more like desert. For other, slightly luckier, winemakers climate change will mean shorter growing seasons, higher alcohol levels, unpredictable weather patterns (drought, hail, storms and rain) and a greater incidence of vineyard pests and diseases. Not quite the four horsemen of the apocalypse, but still a huge challenge.</p> <p>How will the wine business cope? There are two main options for producers: move your vineyards (to higher altitudes or cooler north or south-facing slopes, depending on which hemisphere you are in) or switch your grape variety, or varieties, to cope with higher temperatures. The age-old synergies between, say, tempranillo in Rioja, nebbiolo in Piedmont, merlot in Bordeaux or pinot noir in Burgundy will almost certainly have to change. It's not the end of the world - I would like to see how touriga nacional performs in the M\u00e9doc, for instance - but global warming will revolutionise the wines that we drink.</p> <p>On the plus side, there will be opportunities for countries that are now regarded as marginal players. Apart from English sparkling wine (which could be produced as far north as Yorkshire, according to one estimate), the future could smile on places such as Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Ukraine, Patagonia and Nova Scotia. It's not inconceivable that we could see grapes planted on the east coast of Ireland or even the Falkland Islands.</p> <p>None of these places will churn out huge volumes of wine. Two countries that might are China and India. Neither has produced any great bottles to date (Grover in India is the most promising name), but both have large, untapped populations of potential wine drinkers. Even if the Chinese don't take to wine, they may find ready markets elsewhere. Berry Brothers believes that China, already the world's sixth largest producer, will be \"the world's leading producer of volume wine by 2058\" and that it has \"the essential ingredients to rival the best of Bordeaux\". </p> <p>I'm not convinced by the second part of the argument. My hunch is that China's niche will be in wine's bargain basement, alongside other countries (South Africa, Argentina and a couple in eastern Europe) with a plentiful supply of cheap workers. The worst-case scenario is that China will become a vinous sweatshop, characterised by an exploited, under-aged, non-unionised labour force. If you want to continue to drink inexpensive plonk, it may well be at other people's expense.</p> <p>As wine becomes increasingly globalised, brand owners will source their grapes from a wider variety of countries, blending them to a consistent flavour and aroma profile like a soft drink. I've heard rumours of a company that is planning to set up business in Central America, shipping bulk wine from all over the world to a single location for blending and bottling. As long as the wine is cheap and tastes all right (after the addition of a few grams of sugar) its origin will be immaterial.</p> <p>Not all wine will fall into this sorry category, of course. I think we will see three types of wine in future: a small number of internationally traded, blue-chip fine wines (mainly bought by the very rich) at the top end, a large pool of more or less interchangeable brands made from pinot grigio, chardonnay, sauvignon blanc, cabernet sauvignon and merlot at the bottom, and in the middle, the affordable, interesting stuff which has a sense of place (what the French call \"terroir\").</p> <p>For reasons I've already outlined, that sense of place may not be what it is now. But I still believe that committed, quality-conscious producers will continue to make great wines. Many of them will employ traditional practices (hand picking and pruning, indigenous yeasts, wild fermentations) possibly using organic or even biodynamic methods in the vineyard. Give or take some of the wackier bits of biodynamism, a branch of what its early 20th-century inventor Rudolf Steiner dubbed \"spiritual science\", they will be using techniques that would have been familiar to their great grandfathers. The world of wine is changing at speed, but maybe not as fast as some people fear.</p>",
  "<p>Piers Morgan - tabloid scumbag, dodgy share-tipper and Britain's premier-pantomime-villain-turned-international-televisual sensation - is driving fast down LA's Wilshire Boulevard in an Aston Martin. His teeth (recently whitened) are gleaming and his tan is subtle but definitely there, and Morgan clearly feels a bit like James Bond. He is pleased with himself. He only picked the Aston Martin up this morning, he's already manoeuvred the wrong way down a one-way street ('If we crash and die, I'll be me, and you'll be \"a mysterious brunette\" ha ha!'), but now he's back on course, headed for the Beverly Wilshire hotel of Pretty Woman fame. He stays there for four months of every year while he shoots America's Got Talent, the Simon Cowell franchise that racks up over 25 million viewers, making it America's most-watched TV programme, and Morgan one of America's most-watched presenters.</p> <p>Morgan is instructing me in the finer points of his LA lifestyle.</p> <p>'Firstly: well, you've got to have a nice car to be taken seriously in this town. You've got to have at least an Aston Martin, and then you get treated well by the valet boys, and that's half the battle. They can ignore you for days in a valet park. You can be left there from Monday to Friday. Literally. Secondly: you fly from Heathrow to LAX, first class, BA; and you get seat 1K. 1K's great, because your eye-line naturally goes this way,' Morgan indicates to his right, 'which means other people can't see you, or they can see you, but you can't see them seeing you. Show-offs sit in 1A, because they want to see themselves being seen.'</p> <p>What happens if you can't get 1K? </p> <p>'I didn't once, got 2K; I was spitting blood, but then I realised Michael Caine had got it. So that was OK. I sat behind him and Shakira, and they were very sweet. He called her \"Sha\", and he was talking exactly like: \"Not a lot of people know that.\" Really enjoying going through the magazines, going: \"Here, Sha, look at this car in this advert. Here, Sha, have you read this article?\" Sweet. They're clearly madly in love. You could tell she just gets him.'</p> <p>This is vintage Morgan. Outrageously gossipy and breathlessly name-droppy, and insanely good value. If you've read either the Insider or Don't You Know Who I Am?, the volumes of diaries that Morgan published after being sacked, sensationally, from his job as editor of the Mirror, then you'll be familiar with Morgan's schtik. </p> <p>It never stops. There is absolutely no limit to Morgan's chat, no let-up in the celebrity stories, or the preposterous wisdom, or the showing off. I have been with him for four hours already - we met at 7am for the photo shoot, at which he balanced on Lilos and flirted with assistants - and it hasn't relented. Not for a microsecond. </p> <p>Morgan pulls the Aston Martin into the valet park of the Beverly Wilshire, jumps from the driver's seat, flings himself into the arms of the concierge, and then ushers me through to the hotel's restaurant, pausing long enough to show me where, precisely, Sidney Poitier sits when he comes in for breakfast (which happens at least three times a week). </p> <p>We sit. Morgan orders himself an egg-white frittata and a Diet Coke, and gets recognised by a gaggle of teenage girls and their mom. </p> <p>'Don't be so surprised! I'm a global phenomenon!' he says; and then he announces that he's 'ready for a grilling'. </p> <p>You could probably do this yourself, I say. 'I probably could,' he says. 'Do you know what my first question to me would be? Where did it all go wrong, Piers? Ha ha!'</p> <p>Where indeed? </p> <p>On 14 May 2004, Piers Morgan (who grew up wanting to be a journalist, became one at 20, graduated onto the Sun at 22, and landed editorship of a national newspaper at 28) was fired as editor of the Mirror, after he ran front-page photographs that purported to show British troops torturing captured Iraqi soldiers; photographs that, it had been alleged, were a hoax. Morgan was frogmarched from the building and from the organisation to which, he says, he'd dedicated every waking moment for a decade. He was jobless, staffless and driverless. This came as a bit of a shock because, 'I hadn't had to negotiate Hyde Park Corner in a car for 10 years; hadn't sent a letter myself, didn't even know stamps were self-adhesive, ha ha! Had a bit of a shock when I went to lick one!' But that, he insists, was the limit of his pain. 'I found it quite comical. The first phone call I made was to my literary agent. I said, \"Good news! We can do the book now!\" I'd already written a 12,000 word proposal for the Insider, but my publishers knew I couldn't do anything until I got fired. So it was almost like I was willing it to happen.'</p> <p>He threw himself into the business of professional reinvention. He wrote his books, he spoke at after-dinner events and got paid handsomely for his efforts, he began experimenting with different telly roles, standing in for Philip Schofield on the This Morning sofa, and for Matthew Wright on the Wright Stuff, and co-hosting three series of Channel 4's not entirely successful Morgan and Platell with Amanda Platell. And then his old friend Simon Cowell took him out for lunch, and suggested that he auditioned for a judge spot on Cowell's new US TV show.</p> <p>'He literally said: \"I've sold this show to NBC, I want you to be a judge on it.\" The only problem is persuading NBC. I got flown out, BA, first class - which is when I found out about 1K - and went to Cowell's mansion in Beverly Hills. There were these two NBC execs there, who are quite good friends of mine now, but at the time Cowell said: \"They'll be quite cold with you, they'll be very tough; they don't think it should be you, they've never even heard of you. They don't know who the hell you are!\" I had to really sing for my supper, I went for it. Gave them the whole my-best-friend-Diana patter, you know.' They loved him.</p> <p>'Three weeks later, I was starting work. I came for a month here, where I quite literally didn't know anybody. I was scared. Probably for the first time in my professional life.'</p> <p>He had no idea if he could be a judge on a talent show, he said. He'd never done it before, after all.</p> <p>'But I have to say - it came quite naturally. Being rude to people was not something I found uncomfortable. Ha ha!' </p> <p>America's Got Talent was an instant hit, a runaway, blow-all-the-competition-out-the-water type hit, and Morgan wound up with bodyguards and a vast trailer.</p> <p>'I'm the only Piers they've had on telly, so that's what they shout at me: Piers! Piers! I'm a one-name celebrity.'</p> <p>Like Madonna?</p> <p>'Ha ha! Yes I am!'</p> <p><strong>Piers Morgan enjoys women. He likes their company,</strong> he says, he hopes he's good with them ('You tell me! Ha ha!') and he thinks they make very good journalists. He has already mentioned, en passant, that his friend Anne Robinson has done women journalists a lot of favours by making a lot of money and being very vocal about it - and he said it like he thinks that's important. He also claims to have done right by women journalists when he was at the Mirror. 'I was pretty progressive there. I think I probably quadrupled the women journalists on staff in my time, which I'm proud of.'</p> <p>Morgan enjoys something approaching sex-symbol status. When I tell people I'm due to interview him, a significant amount of friends reveal that he's their secret crush. 'I get much more attractive, the more telly I do,' he says. 'Much more! Women who literally would spit at me in the street, are now saying: My God, you're so sexy! It's TV. It's make-up, it's lighting, it's camera work, it's good directors, it's the fact that TV's a fantasy world. Simon Cowell has an almost hypnotic effect on women. They scream at him like he's the Beatles! You think: How would this guy get this kind of action if he wasn't on the biggest TV show in the world? And the answer is, he wouldn't. And I think he knows that. But he loves it.'</p> <p>Does he, Piers, have groupies?</p> <p>'Yes! The best one I got was when I won the 2008 Celebrity Apprentice [presided over by Donald Trump]. At the party afterwards, I was talking to my mum and my sister - they'd flown out for it. And a very attractive blonde came up to me, and touched my hand, dropped a piece of paper into it, she'd written her phone number on it. And she said: \"Give me a call later, we'll hook up. And trust me - I'm no apprentice!\" And my mother went: \"Did she just do what I think she did?\" I said, \"I'm afraid so, mother. They're called 'groupies'.\" I loved the moment. And she was bloody hot, too! But then to walk over to the bin and go, kacha!' He mimes throwing the piece of paper away. </p> <p>He says he doesn't fancy American women as a rule. 'Apart from Scarlet Johansson. I think they're sexless. I cannot imagine Americans having sex with each other.'</p> <p>He is less forthcoming about his relationships with British women. At 26, he married Marion Shalloe, the couple have three sons together. They've been separated for 'a long time now' according to Morgan; although their divorce was only finalised this year. (Morgan, who is Catholic, says he feels guilty about everything.) </p> <p>Morgan's current girlfriend is the smart, tall and famously beautiful Daily Telegraph writer, Celia Walden. </p> <p>'You've got to have the obligatory trophy girlfriend to go with the trophy car,' Morgan says, 'which I think I've done quite well, with Celia.'</p> <p>The two of them have been together since Morgan interviewed her in 2006; and Morgan is very pleased with himself indeed on the Walden front. He mentions her constantly, despite insisting he never talks about his personal life. He drops references to her likes and dislikes and her stupefying beauty, like a skittish schoolgirl with a boy band crush. He tells me she loves TV crime programmes and hates on-line bitching, and regales me with stories of all the celebrity interviewees who've fallen for her in the course of her career. </p> <p>Yes, about Celia Walden, I say. Er: how?</p> <p>'How the hell did I manage that one, is that what you're saying? Ha ha! I always say to her: \"I could have had any woman I wanted.\" And she says: \"Really? What do you base that argument on?\" And I say: \"Well, I got you, didn't I?\" Irrefutable logic. It must be true. How else could I have ended up with this incredibly beautiful woman?' </p> <p>Are you going to marry her? </p> <p>'You're invading my privacy in an outrageous way! Pull yourself together and we'll forget you ever asked that.'</p> <p>Which is partly a joke, because of course, all Morgan ever did as editor of the Mirror was invade the privacy of celebrities, and he makes a fairly regular habit of it even now, in his monthly interview sessions for GQ magazine. (It was Morgan who got Helen Mirren to admit to taking cocaine and Nick Clegg to reveal that he'd slept with nearly 30 women.) But also, it's a way of avoiding a question. He'll tell me later, while a bit drunk, that he's happy with the idea of remarrying in principle.</p> <p>In the meantime, Walden provides a decent foil for Morgan. The two live separately when they're both in London; when Morgan's in LA, Walden flies out to see him every once in a while. He took her to the Playboy Mansion for Hugh Hefner's annual Midsummer Night party, and two women tried to drag him off into the grotto. 'When I told the Hoff [David Hasselhoff, Morgan's co-host on America's Got Talent] that I'd taken my girlfriend to the Playboy Mansion, he said: \"Dude! You do not take sand to the beach!\"' </p> <p>I ask him how LA he's getting. He's had his teeth whitened, for example.</p> <p>'Bloody hurt. Incredibly painful.'</p> <p>And he's training with a personal trainer.</p> <p>'Three, four times a week. They're obsessed with aesthetics here. Teeth especially - they think that all Brits have terrible teeth, and they're obsessed with it. I'd never have plastic surgery. I'll never have Botox and I'll never dye my hair. But teeth - I don't have a problem with whitening your teeth, that's fine. Why not?'</p> <p>Is he building up to a complete set of veneers?</p> <p>'God, no! End up like Cowell? You've got to be joking. There must be limits, and they're called Simon Cowell's teeth! Ha ha!'</p> <p>He says he loves it when he bumps into old Fleet Street colleagues, and they look 10 years older than he, 43-year-old Morgan, does. </p> <p>He romps on, tells me about his intercelebrity feuds with Carol Vorderman, Jeremy Clarkson, Ian Hislop and Robbie Coltrane ('All a bit of a laugh, really; part of the caricature'); about the \u00a32.5 million chatshow deal he's signed with ITV ('Couldn't possibly comment on the money. Ha ha!'); about taping Britain's Got Talent and walking in on Amanda Holden, naked. ('Once in every four audition shows, I'll walk into her dressing room and she'll be stark naked. And I think she's doing it deliberately.' ) </p> <p>I surprise him only once with a question. How shallow is he? </p> <p>'Shallow?' He seems hurt that I've asked. 'No. I don't think I am really. Not shallow.'</p> <p>A pause. </p> <p>'I'm going to a party Donald Trump's throwing later. Do you want to come?'</p> <p>Donald Trump's party is brilliantly ghastly. It's what they call a 'gala' in these circles, hosted in a glossy estate in Bel Air, in honour of flogging the notion of his new hotel in Dubai. 'What time does he start selling the timeshares?' asks John Ferriter, Morgan's LA agent. </p> <p>Morgan works the party, gets accosted by fans, charms the right TV execs. We see Orlando Bloom and Hilary Swank; Morgan introduces me to Trump, who tells me: 'Morgan owes me his career. I take 50 per cent of everything he earns.'</p> <p>'The Donald does actually think he made me,' whispers Morgan.</p> <p>We also see one of the hottest male TV stars du jour, a man who, John Ferriter tells me, is what they call 'a Dalmatian' in the business. 'Beautiful to look at, stupid enough to eat his own shit,' and we're accosted, as a group, by a woman called Lindsay, who works as one of the dolly birds on the US version of Deal Or No Deal. 'I'm number 26!' she says, proudly. Morgan calls her Number 26 for the rest of the evening.</p> <p>We leave as Christina Aguilera begins a live set; and head back to the Beverly Wilshire for $80 steaks in Wolfgang Puck's restaurant, only stopping to pick up Tom Green, comedian and ex-husband of Drew Barrymore. He's going on the next series of Celebrity Apprentice and wants to pick Morgan's brains about it; at around midnight, my day with Morgan draws to a close.</p> <p><strong>There is absolutely no good reason on this planet </strong>to like Piers Morgan. His crimes are manifold. He's a show-off and a hypocrite and he's obsessed by celebrity and the benefits it can bring him. </p> <p>He thinks the whole of Fleet Street is jealous of him, because he's renounced the legitimacy of journalism for the bright lights and easy cash of populist telly.</p> <p>I ask him how he'd describe himself, and he says: 'What was it David Aaronovitch said about me? \"Thin-skinned, narcissistic, something-or-other ignoramous\". And I read it all and I thought: fair enough.' </p> <p>He texts and emails me a lot after we meet, which is a manipulative ploy; he wants to maintain my goodwill while I write about him. He wants me to like him. </p> <p>Problem is, I do. Morgan's entirely likeable. He is arrogant, he is pompous, he is pleased with himself; but he also knows how absurd his life is, how quickly and completely this could evaporate. Or he does a good job of acting like he does, anyway. 'That,' he says, 'is the benefit of becoming famous in your forties. You see the funny side of it! The absurdity! You find it endlessly entertaining, you don't take it seriously, you know there's a real world out there, and you know however bad things get, there are people on sink estates in Glasgow, watching you on TV, dreaming that one day, they'll have the glamorous life you are lucky enough to enjoy, and you know they'll never experience it. You've got to remind yourself of that every single time you go on TV. How lucky you are. I can't stand whingeing celebrities, who whine about paparazzi, and intrusion and the hell of being famous.'</p> <p>Mere hours after I get back home from LA, I receive the first of several emails from Morgan. He's back in the Aston Martin, en route to his big, fancy trailer, and he's just looked up the dictionary definition of global phenomenon for me, because of course, he insisted that he is one. 'It says it's an unlikely, and unaccountable fact or occurrence,' he writes. He thinks this could be the key to our interview. Perhaps it is. Introducing Piers Morgan, an unlikely and unaccountable fact or occurrence.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Piers Morgan's new interview series, The Dark Side Of Fame starts on BBC1, 8 September, 10.35pm</p>",
  "<h2>Bid rumour boosts RSA stock</h2> <p>Insurer Royal Sun Alliance, now RSA, is under the bid spotlight again. Shares soared this week on rumours that German insurance giant Allianz could pounce before the end of the month. Not impossible as RSA chief Andy Haste has done a good job in tidying up the portfolio and the company would make a neat fit for Allianz, or Switzerland's Zurich Financial. Last month, RSA beat forecasts with a 9 per cent rise in first-half profits. But the UK insurance market remains overcrowded, reinforcing the argument for consolidation as a way of bringing supply and demand back into kilter. Another mooted bidder for RSA is said to be entrepreneur Andrew Regan, who tried, unsuccessfully, to take over the Co-op in 1996. RSA shares closed near an annual high of 163p on Friday. Either something is afoot, or someone is ramping the stock.</p> <h2>Share dip dulls Lonmin shine</h2> <p>Lonmin's shares closed the week below the indicative offer price tabled three weeks ago by rival miner Xstrata, pitched at \u00a333. With fears of a global recession increasing, traders are taking profits after pushing commodity prices to record levels. Platinum prices have fallen by nearly 10 per cent in the past fortnight. But the decline in the Lonmin share price is nothing more than short-term profit-taking by hedge funds, not evidence that Xstrata, headed by Mick Davis, pictured, might walk. Davis is said to be quite determined to bag his target. </p> <h2>Lean times for banks</h2> <p>Banks might look as cheap as chips, but could they get even cheaper? Stories are circulating of a regulatory clampdown by the US, Swiss and British authorities. The idea is to force banks to be much more robustly capitalised to help prevent a repeat of the credit crunch. The most radical idea is to force investment banks to be more conservative and restrict how much they are permitted to borrow. In other words, banks of every hue will have to hoard cash and restrict borrowing to conform to the new rules. The recession that is looming could last much longer than expected.</p>",
  "<p>George Best City Airport in Belfast has been sold for nearly four times the amount its owners paid for it five years ago, it was announced yesterday.</p> <p>The Ferrovial Group sold Belfast's second airport to the ABN Amro Global Infrastructure Fund for \u00a3132.5m. The Spanish company, which owns Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted and other UK airports, paid \u00a335m in 2003 for what was then Belfast City Airport. Two years later it was renamed after the former Manchester United and Northern Ireland player who died in 2005 at 59.</p> <p>The new owner will now face a battle over introducing night flights at the airport, which overlooks Belfast Lough. Brian Ambrose, the airport's chief executive said: 'The sale is the result of Ferrovial's strategy to focus its UK airport business within the BAA group, manager of various UK airports. </p> <p>'The capital gain on sale, in accordance with preliminary calculations, is \u00a385m.' Completion was expected before the end of the month. 'The sale does not affect the day-to-day business of the airport and we look forward to continuing to serve both our business partners and customers. We also look forward to continued investment in the airport.' </p> <p>The Competition Commission said last month that BAA should sell two of its airports in the south east of England and either Glasgow or Edinburgh. Belfast was not mentioned because it was owned by Ferrovial directly rather than through BAA.</p> <p>The airport started commercial operations in 1983 when owned by Belfast aerospace company, Shorts. A new multimillion pound expansion of facilities and a new terminal arrived in 2001 and by last year it catered for 2.2 million passengers.It is projected to be used by half a million more this year. The airport now employs 100 people directly and 1,500 indirectly.</p> <p>The new owner will have to decide whether to seek to extend the runway - as demanded by operators such as Ryanair - and expand the number of flights.People living close to the airport have long campaigned for a cap on operations, claiming bigger aircraft or later flights would make their lives even more uncomfortable.</p> <p>ABN Amro was bought last October by a consortium of three major banks - RBS, Spain's Santander, which also owns Abbey, and Brussels-based Fortis.</p>",
  "<p>They say you should never take a holiday in the same place twice, but the Yarde Orchard Bunkhouse on the Tarka Cycle Trail in north Devon made such an impression on me that I found myself staying there twice this year.</p> <p>We cycled the Tarka Trail in summer last year while staying with friends and loved it. Following the old railway line between Braunton and Meeth, the 30-mile trail is traffic-free and surfaced for cyclists and walkers. My sons - Hugo, five, and Louis, nine - are both keen cyclists and they soared happily along. </p> <p>During that trip we made it as far as East Yarde, where I chatted with David Job, the owner of the Yarde Orchard Cafe. I inquired about the timber building he was constructing at the bottom of his vegetable garden, which turned out to be an eco-friendly bunkhouse with solar-heated water, a wood-burning range and a reed-bed system to deal naturally with water waste. It was not due to open until 2008 and, as this was to be the only accommodation right on the trail, we promised to come back. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337399110\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/09/08/yardeembed.jpg\" alt=\"Yarde Orchard Cafe and bunkhouse\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yarde Orchard Cafe and bunkhouse</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Catherine Mack</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So this Easter we returned for my first stay at East Yarde. The children's bikes had been locked up since Santa dragged them down the chimney and it was time to blow off the cobwebs. </p> <p>Although the area is easily accessible by train, I wimped out and drove, nervous of unpredictable weather. We arrived seven hours later, after several car-sickness stops and the inevitable halts to adjust the bike carrier. The ever-affable David greeted us like old friends. We had the whole building to ourselves, which was a luxury. The wood-burning range was packed with sweet-smelling apple wood, the hand-made bunkbeds awaited the test of boys' bouncing and appetites were soon revived for David's home-made pizzas from the cafe.</p> <p>This is clean, simple hostel accommodation with two dormitories, a small practical kitchen and a family bedroom. We had a great first night's sleep, waking up early to add logs to the range, the only heat source in the hostel, which was still awaiting radiators. It didn't matter in the slightest - donning extra cardies, we were perfectly cosy. Our bedrooms looked out on to the wooded banks of the trail which, even though it is part of the National Cycle Network's Coast-to-Coast route from Plymouth to Ilfracombe, is relatively quiet. This 30-mile off-road section is a bit too lightweight for serious Lycra-clad cyclists, so it is perfect for families, either walking or cycling. </p> <p>The trail follows the River Torridge, the fictional birthplace of Henry Williamson's Tarka the Otter. Living in London, it was a delightful relief to watch my own little otters take off at speed, with a sense of freedom they never get in the city. The route was lined with wild primroses and narcissi, as well as an eclectic collection of sculptures and, depending on which bits you tackle, it is sided either by woodland or the sandy shores of the Torridge estuary. </p> <p>From a practical point of view this holiday is superb. No battles with bike racks before heading off every day, no picnic preparations - just get up, make breakfast, jump on the bikes and go. In the mornings, the children went up and down the trail immediately outside the bunkhouse or played in its landscaped hilly garden as we sipped a second cappuccino from the cafe. </p> <p>David's cafe is brimming with good homemade food, all locally produced. The bunkhouse is at one of the highest points on the trail, and one incentive to get back up the long, gently sloping hill after an early-morning cycle to Torrington was the promise of the Yarde's Cyclist's Breakfast: Cornish smoked bacon, local sausages, free-range eggs and organic baked beans. </p> <p>For other supplies, the thriving market town of Great Torrington is accessible by bike, car or bus. There seemed to be two of everything there: two greengrocers, two butchers and two bakers. The Green Lantern on the town square, a bakery with a cafe, is a must. I felt as if I had stepped into a Hovis advert, with racks of iced buns, scones and enormous warm squidgy loaves being emptied from their baking tins on to the shelves. </p> <p>We couldn't leave Devon without one trip to the beach, and riding 12 miles along the trail took us to Instow, a small town on the sandy banks of the estuary where the rivers Taw and Torridge meet, which is ideal for paddling. It may sound like a long way, but it's amazing how many miles you cover on these mainly flat surfaces without even realising. The children couldn't believe it at bedtime when I told them they had cycled 24 miles that day. </p> <p>Yarde Orchard is not only a welcoming place to stay, it is also great value, in a superb location and as friendly as it is eco. So a couple of months later, when a girlfriend and I decided we needed a mid-week break - no work, no kids, no hassle - I knew exactly where to head; this time by train. We took the 9.04 from Paddington to Exeter, changed onto the Tarka Line train to Barnstaple and walked straight into Tarka Trail Cycle Hire, conveniently located on the station platform just metres from the trail. </p> <p>Equipped with shiny new bikes, Laura and I took a gentle three-hour ride along the trail, arriving through Yarde Orchard's gates in time for afternoon tea, after a couple of stops for snacks and shandies at some of the converted railway stations along the way. The primroses had been swapped for wild orchids, the narcissi for an abundance of aromatic wild garlic and the fields were full of lambs, foals and calves. </p> <p>I wasn't sure whether the cafe would still be open when we got there, so I had pre-ordered a Devon hamper from Red Earth Kitchen. Arriving to home-made beef and mushroom stew, new potatoes and hot chocolate pudding made the 18-mile cycle seem worthwhile. </p> <p>After a great night's sleep in the tranquillity of this rural idyll, with the apple trees now in full blossom, we awoke refreshed and ready to cycle all the way back. It was raining, however, so we were able to postpone our departure and enjoy David's coffee and chat for a bit longer. We finally hit the trail again and, after a few hours more cycling we caught our 5pm train to London. I slept all the way back, exhausted, relaxed and already planning my Yarde Orchard hat-trick. I have been spoilt until now by always having the place to myself, as it is still pretty unknown. So next time I am going to book the whole place, filling a train carriage with family and friends, hitting the trail in convoy (kids and all) and ordering David's pizzas all round, for the perfect autumn pick-me-up.</p> <h2>Essentials</h2> <p>A bed in a shared dorm at the Yarde Orchard Bunkhouse, Torrington, Devon (07972 786306; <a href=\"http://www.yarde-orchard.co.uk\">yarde-orchard.co.uk</a>) costs \u00a312 (\u00a38 for under-16s).

  "<p>In Houston, Houma and Hilton Head, hurricanes habitually happen. But that doesn't mean they're much of a news story outside the American cable TV loop. Mostly, indeed, they can prove a bit of a bore, a puddle of anticlimax after days of frantic foreplay - the no-change of climate change.</p> <p>Thus, last week, the Times saw 'a million flee the Big Easy' as Gustav closed in, pounding towards force 4. New Orleans was either 'braced' for disaster or 'evacuated' according to whether you wanted to get excited with the Sun or the Telegraph.</p> <p>'Second time unlucky?' asked the Indie front page. Prepare for the 'mother of all storms', warned an anxious mayor. 'Get your butts out of here.' An injunction largely ignored by reporters from around the globe, who backed their butts bravely into the eye of destruction. Republican convention suspended; presidential plans upended.</p> <p>It was all pulsating stuff. Except that poor old Gustav got tired somewhere out in the Gulf, downgraded to category one and veered west at the last minute, skilfully skirting any major area of population. 'Phew, Orleans!' said a sweating Sun. But keep the faith and the big type handy, brothers. Hurricane Hanna is out there waiting to do it all over again - and prevent any meaningful, but highly necessary, pause for media or political thought. </p> <p>Of course, killer hurricanes like Katrina can be huge stories. Of course, the 94-plus souls who died on Gustav's journey across the Caribbean matter (though you wouldn't have guessed that from most US or UK coverage). Of course, mayors, presidents and candidates need to sound an alarm. But there is a continuing price to be paid here.</p> <p>It's not just the squelch of high drama deflated, the sense that next time (or the time after) millions will find fleeing a tedious option. In many ways, the defiance of science is even more dismaying. Two big polls in America and Britain this summer told the same story - 45 per cent of Americans asked what caused global warming said 'natural causes' or 'case unproven'. In the UK, 60 per cent of respondents told Ipsos-Mori that scientists weren't sure what triggered climate change - and 40 per cent thought it might not be as bad as painted anyway. In short, you can have 2,500 scientists all signed up to the same grim hymn sheet - but still not commanding belief.</p> <p>Who do you blame for that? Mediamen blame the media, naturally enough. George Monbiot of the Guardian finds Channel Four at the root of all evil, and affronted scientists join him in that charge. Yet the spectacle of Gus running out of gas raises a somewhat different hypothesis.</p> <p>The entire weight of the White House, its scientific advisers and its climate service warned of impending tragedy. Every TV weather forecast had its red ball of destruction rolling in. A million souls rolled out of town. And yet, in essence, very little transpired.</p> <p>'Gustav does its worst but New Orleans survives,' said an almost reproachful Guardian headline. Gustav's worst was simply not bad enough... And, in turn, that raises an awkward emotional hiatus. The god of science, speaking via assorted oracles, thinks it knows what cities will be under water by 2050, which lands will be burnt and arid by 3000 - but it can't tell us, here and now, where a hurricane will hit in five hours' time, or with what velocity. And the contrast opens wide. 'Phew!' - the blinking Bun is mopping its brow. Take your tablets of doom with a pinch of salt. Scientific prophesy, as my dad used to say, can be 'all wind and water'.</p> <p>Now, I don't doubt the threat or reality of climate change. It's ominous that such a threat isn't widely believed - and widely thought to be exaggerated. But have we - the scientists, the politicians, the hacks - got our tone of voice right? Every step we take is complex, and pretty uncertain. (A press seminar I was at recently saw one distinguished green belabouring another for daring to link hurricane frequency to global warming.) Tracking Gustav's last offshore hours isn't like measuring polar ice caps, to be sure. Moving butts in a bind isn't like mapping rainforests. </p> <p>But credibility is common to both, and crucial. It counts when the likes of Hanna and Ike threaten devastation - and when they don't. So it's time to ask, more deeply, why the public's scepticism about climate change is growing, not fading. And every assertion we make has to be argued in detail stripped of hysteria, not wrapped in the mother of all hyperbole.</p>",
  "<p>Has the Carphone Warehouse taken the UN project One Laptop Per child (OLPC) a little too literally? I only ask because the communication giant's latest adverts exhort families to buy not just one family computer, but a laptop for every living being in the homestead. </p> <p>But while the OLPC is about providing 'rugged', wind-up laptops for the poorest children on earth in order to provide mass access to education, the latter scheme is about shifting more laptops into homes already stuffed full of more personal electronics than ever before, a fact which threatens to undo any environmental gains achieved by the increased energy efficiency of most appliances. Factor in the amount of materials extracted from the earth's crust just to produce these short-lived items and the vision is not particularly pretty. </p> <p>At least not as attractive as leasing, hiring or borrowing goods instead, in which case you become a transumer as opposed to a consumer. While car clubs (such as www.citycarclub.co.uk) now operate across the UK, the majority of transumer schemes are still admittedly niche. The residents of Gotland island in Sweden, for example, use Electrolux's pay-per-wash project. Instead of buying washing machines, the customer 'borrows' a new, eco-efficient washing machine and pays Electrolux for the service, not the machine. In green terms this not only cuts down on waste, but research shows that when the product remains with the manufacturer, there is an incentive to produce more durable goods. </p> <p>Similarly, don't bother aspiring to own an Interface Evergreen carpet, because it is only available to lease by the month (www.interface-resource-europe.com). 'We sell only the services of the carpet,' says the company website: 'the colour, design, texture, warmth, acoustics, comfort under foot and cleanliness.' </p> <p>If this caring, sharing approach makes even more sense in transient periods of life, such as pregnancy, the La Leche League (a pro-breastfeeding society) runs a Maternity Clothes Library, where you can hire outfits for your full term (www.llloxford.org.uk). </p> <p>Sadly, not all consumer goods manufacturers are suddenly going to roll out proactive leasing schemes, given they have a vested interest in selling more and faster, as in the case of the global $23.4bn power-tool industry. But given that the average power drill is used for just four minutes every year \u2013 a slothful work rate matched by many other garden and DIY tools \u2013 it makes sense as a consumer to join a tool-sharing scheme, or even to start one. </p> <p>It all helps to take the ecological heat out of consumerism, a strategy that needn't only be applied to prosaic stuff such as washing machines. You can even take a transumerist approach to that icon of contemporary fashion, the 'it' bag. Yes, with an annual subscription to a bag library (www.be-a-fashionista.co.uk) you can borrow a Birkin or lease a Louis Vuitton and nobody will be any the wiser.<br><a href=\"mailto:lucy.siegle@observer.co.uk\"><br>lucy.siegle@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

  "<p>Your Sunday roast stands accused. According to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/07/food.foodanddrink\">United Nation's chief climate expert, Rajendra Pachauri</a>, that tasty piece of top rump resting on your dining table is the source of many of the world's environmental woes, in particular those involved in the dangerous warming of the planet's climate. </p> <p>Our appetite for animal flesh is boosting fertiliser production, pollution and emission of greenhouse gases to dangerous levels, Pachauri has told The Observer. Give up meat - at least for one day a week - and we can help to save the Earth, he added.</p> <p>Nor is Pachauri, the chairman of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, alone in his complaints. A host of campaigners have united to condemn meat-eaters for bringing environmental mayhem to the world. 'The human appetite for animal flesh is a driving force behind virtually every major category of environmental damage now threatening the human future: deforestation, erosion, fresh water scarcity, air and water pollution, climate change, biodiversity loss, social injustice, the destabilisation of communities and the spread of disease,' the Worldwatch Institute has warned.</p> <p>These are harsh charges to bring against those of us who love our leg of lamb or the odd fillet for our dinner. And not surprisingly, the meat industry has robustly rejected the accusations. Chris Lamb, head of marketing for the pig industry group BPEX, said meat producers were being unfairly targeted while some environmentalists' proposals for cutting emissions were actually harmful. For example, keeping livestock indoors would cut carbon dioxide but damage animal welfare, he said. 'Climate change is a very young science and our view is there are a lot of very simplistic solutions being proposed.' Nevertheless, it is clear that meat-eating has been forced on to the defensive in recent months, a point highlighted by Raj Patel, author of Stuffed and Served (Portobello Books) in a recent article in Observer Food Monthly (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/jun/22/foodanddrink.food\">Is meat off the menu?</a>, June 22) . He believes growing food for animals is a waste of resources in an overcrowded world.</p> <p>'The average meat eater in the US produces about 1.5 tonnes of carbon dioxide more than a vegetarian every year. That's because animals are hungry and the grain they eat takes energy, usually fossil fuels, to produce,' he says.</p> <p>The world's fertiliser industry uses natural gas as a basic ingredient and therefore contributes to global warming when it uses fossil fuel to manufacture the extra fertilisers needed to ensure cattle and other animals have sufficient food. For example, it requires 2.2 calories of fossil-fuel energy to produce a single calorie of plant protein, according to researchers at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. In turn, it takes even more plant protein to make animal protein. It requires four calories of plant protein to make one of chicken protein, while the ratio for pork is 17:1; for lamb, 50:1; and for beef, a staggering 54:1. 'That is a lot of energy and a lot of grain diverted,' adds Patel.</p> <p>In fact, it is a massive amount of energy, the journal Physics World has noted. 'The animals we eat emit 21 per cent of all the carbon dioxide that can be attributed to human activity,' it states.</p> <p>Geophysicists Gidon Eshel and Pamela Martin from the University of Chicago have even calculated that changing eating habits to become a vegetarian does more to fight global warming than switching from a gas-guzzling SUV to a fuel-efficient hybrid car, such is the amount of Co2 generated in the production of beef, pork or lamb. </p> <p>Nor is carbon dioxide the only issue. Apart from turning grain into flesh, livestock also transforms it into methane, as flatulence. And that has especially serious consequences, as the World Watch Institute stressed in 2004 in its report 'State of the World'. 'Belching, flatulent livestock emit 16 percent of the world's annual production of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas,' it noted. </p> <p>According to scientists' calculations, methane has a global warming potential that is 23 times that of carbon dioxide. This means that a gram of methane - produced from a cow's rear-end - warms the planet's atmosphere 23 times as much as a gram of CO2 produced, say, from a car engine. Thus the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation has concluded that nearly a fifth of all greenhouse-gas emissions come from livestock, more than from all forms of transport.</p> <p>On top of these ecological headaches, there is the issue of rainforest clearance. Despite all efforts to halt their destruction, rainforests are still being cut down at an alarming rate. Every year, 32 million acres - an area the size of England - is destroyed or degraded. Some of this land is used to provide pasture for cows. Other areas are given over to fields for the growing of soya beans which are then used to feed cows. </p> <p>Apart from the increased amounts of methane and carbon dioxide that are produced by this type of farming, the world loses out though loss of wildlife - 90 percent of all species on Earth live in rainforests - as well as through the destruction of trees which filter our air, emit oxygen and absorb carbon dioxide. Rainforests are the lungs of the Earth but we are choking them through our appetite for meat, say environmentalists.</p> <p>Nor are there any signs of improvement. In 2006, farmers produced an estimated 276 million tonnes of chicken, pork, beef and other meat: four times as much as they did in 1961, according to the Worldwatch Institute. On average, each person on the planet now eats about 43kg of animal flesh. Nor is this trend getting any better. It is estimated that meat production is destined to double from its present level by the middle of the century.</p> <p>Hence, Pachauri's urging of the world to give up meat for at least one day a week. 'In terms of immediacy of action and the feasibility of bringing about reductions in a short period of time, it clearly is the most attractive opportunity,' said Pachauri, an Indian economist and a vegetarian. 'Give up meat for one day [a week] initially, and decrease it from there,' he added.</p> <p>It is a fairly forceful conclusion and it has triggered an equally robust response from those who belief the lifestyle of a carnivore is perfectly acceptable, both morally and environmentally. In a counterblast to Raj Patel's Observer Food Monthly article, the distinguished food writer Joanna Blythman said that universal prescriptions for solving the world's food crisis should be treated with suspicion. 'Try telling the Masai tribesmen who have reared livestock for millennia that they should plough up scrubby Kenyan savannah and plant millet,' she argued.</p> <p>As to 'wet, green Britain', it lends itself to livestock production. 'Huge upland swathes of the country are quite incapable of growing food crops, but this otherwise useless land can be grazed by cattle, sheep, goats, deer and other game,' Blythman added.</p> <p>Certainly, in Britain, the idea that meat production is a recipe for widespread environmental destruction is not as easy to sustain as it is in other parts of the world, such as the Brazilian rainforest. As UK farmers point out, grazing animals on uplands keeps heather and grasses under control and help some of our rarest birds to survive, in particular ground-nesting birds such as the lapwing, curlew, golden plover, snipe and red grouse. And in turn, these birds provide for food for UK raptors, including the red kite and golden eagle. Take away our sheep and cows and the environmental impact could be disastrous. As a recent RSPB report stated: 'Grazing animals form an important component of the uplands.'</p> <p>Nor are birds the only concern. Heather left untamed grows out of control - stringy and lanky - and strangles the growth of other plant species. Without sheep and cattle to graze on them, heather landscapes would eventually become barren and would start to pose fire risks. Crucially, this latter problem strikes at the very heart of the relationship between farming in Britain and the issue of global warming. </p> <p>Our peatlands, which cover much of our upland regions, are massive stores of carbon dioxide. In England and Wales, they could absorb up to 41,000 tonnes of CO2 a year if they were in pristine condition. But if damaged by burning, as well as by too much draining of water and by overgrazing, as has occurred in the past, they could release hundreds of thousands of tonnes of carbon dioxide. </p> <p>So protecting peat has become a major ecological priority for Britain, and authorities now recognise the important role that hill farmers who rear cattle and sheep play in maintaining this vital habitat.</p> <p>As to the rest of British farmland, which sits on lower ground and richer soil, there is some room for change though the benefits are obvious. </p> <p>'It is true that Britain also has extensive areas of semi-natural grassland with richer soil, currently used for livestock that could, theoretically, be drained and ploughed to grow fruit, vegetable and cereals,' says Blythman. </p> <p>'But in that process, all the carbon that is currently taken out of the atmosphere and stored in grass pasture would be released into the environment.'</p> <p>The issue of meat-eating and global warming is far from clear cut, in other words. Turning to a vegetarian diet to save the planet might produce significant cuts in carbon production in many parts of the world but it could also have damaging consequences for others, including Britain. The UK has a long, established tradition in lifestock production and its agriculture is geared to those ends. So yes, cut back on your week's intake of ham and chicken as Pachauri suggests but individuals should not feel pressured into adopting a lifestyle that is completely vegetarian in order to help to halt global warming. </p> <p>As Blythman says: 'A no-meat diet? That sounds like ideology triumphing over common sense, time-honoured custom and appetite.'</p>",
  "<p>Not so long ago, Britain and the rest of Europe were rejoicing in America's presidential choice of Barack Obama versus John McCain. The hated George W Bush would be gone and a sensible, smart leader would inhabit the White House again - whoever won. The Economist put McCain and Obama on its cover and declared, 'This is the most impressive choice America has had for a very long time.' Praise the Lord.</p> <p>Then along came Sarah Palin, the lightly travelled Christian evangelical McCain chose as his running mate. Much has been made of the soap-operatic side of the governor of Alaska: the caribou-hunting, mooseburger-eating mother-of-five who drives herself to work, her beauty queen past, her pregnant, unwed 17-year-old daughter. What really matters is what she believes in and why McCain selected her. On both counts, much of the world outside America will not be pleased.</p> <p>Palin describes herself and her family as 'typical'. But to most of the planet, she's an exotic. She's a fundamentalist Christian. She advocated teaching creationism alongside evolution in Alaska's schools. Her right-to-life convictions extend to stem cell research, which she opposes. </p> <p>She's opposed to gay marriage. She's about as right as a Republican can get. She does not believe human behaviour is responsible for global warming. She supports home schooling and other alternatives to traditional state education. She's anti-gun control; for example, she supports ending the ban on handguns that has existed in Washington DC for more than three decades.</p> <p>Palin has said she would not force her views on others. Indeed, she kept a campaign pledge not to push as governor for mandatory inclusion of creationism in her state's school curriculum. But she cannot pretend always to divorce her personal views from matters of state and governance. In praying that a natural gas pipeline would be built in Alaska, she used traditional evangelical language. She believes the US mission in Iraq is a 'task that is from God'.</p> <p>The McCain who chose Palin is not the McCain familiar to many of us outside the US. The McCain we know is a worldly, well-informed, straight-talking Republican who's a likeable fixture at policy talking shops in London and Berlin, a man at ease with men and women of international affairs across the world. His views do not always coincide with his chums in world capitals - eg, his hawkishness on Iraq - but he's long been seen as a safe and pragmatic pair of hands on big issues like trade (he's a free trader, more so than Obama) and the environment (unlike Palin, he accepts that human behaviour is a contributor to climate change).</p> <p>The McCain who chose Palin is someone who found himself in a political panic. In the weeks before the Democratic national convention, the polls put Obama and McCain head to head. Predictably, Obama got a boost after the Democratic lovefest in Denver. But even discounting that, at a time of widespread disaffection with Bush and the Republican party more generally, the inertia of public opinion heading into an election seemed to favour Obama. The natural inclination of many of McCai n's advisers was to turn to the base, the far right wing of the party, much of it evangelical, whose money, hard work and get-out-the-vote fervour could make a big difference on 4 November.</p> <p>Under other circumstances, McCain might have gone for somebody more like himself - Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, a pro-Iraq war Democrat-turned-independent, or former Pennsylvania governor Tom Ridge, chosen by Bush to be the first director of the Office of Homeland Security after 9/11. But Lieberman, who is Jewish, and Ridge, a Catholic, are supporters of abortion rights. McCain occupies a kind of middle ground: he's in favour of overturning Roe versus Wade, the Supreme Court decision upholding a woman's right to abortion, but he's against prosecuting women who have abortions. If how to appeal to the base was the question, neither Lieberman nor Ridge was the answer.</p> <p>Palin was. Her inexperience is easily ridiculed, especially when Cindy McCain, John's wife, comes along and tries to portray Palin as a keen Kremlinologist ('Remember: Alaska is the closest part of our continent to Russia. So, it's not as if she doesn't understand what's at stake.') Palin's message to the world is much like the one she delivered last Wednesday to her detractors in America: 'Here's a little news flash for all those reporters and commentators: I'm not going to Washington to seek their good opinion - I'm going to Washington to serve the people of this country.'</p> <p>The message of her candidacy, the message of McCain's choice, is equally plain. America's religious right is back. In fact, despite all the wishful thinking riding on the departure of Bush, the religious right never really went away.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Stryker McGuire is a contributing editor of 'Newsweek' and editor of 'International Quarterly'.</p>",

  "<p>The cardboard boxes are piled high at Tina Gaudoin's new Manhattan apartment on the island's affluent upper west side. Gaudoin, the British executive hired to launch the Wall Street Journal's eagerly-anticipated glossy new supplement, WSJ, moved house last Wednesday, the same day the title was finally unveiled to advertisers after six months in the making.</p> <p>The timing could hardly have been worse for the high-flying former Times executive, but she sounds relieved to be leaving her old home in Westport, a picturesque coastal town in Connecticut 47 miles north of New York. 'It was a bit Desperate Housewives,' she says in a late afternoon phone call from the Journal's offices in the heart of New York's financial district, and she won't miss the daily two-hour commute. </p> <p>The city's incestuous media world will be poring over WSJ's first edition, which represents a gamble of sorts for an uncompromisingly serious paper that has never before flirted with the frivolities of lifestyle journalism. </p> <p>WSJ will be published four times a year at first, but Dow Jones's new owner Rupert Murdoch, currently spending most of his time overseeing the redesigned paper, has big plans for the supplement and it's likely to go monthly next year. 'He has seen it and he likes it,' Gaudoin reports. </p> <p>Formerly editor of Luxx, a luxury title published by the Times, she had launched four magazine before she followed former Times editor Robert Thomson - now in charge of the Journal - from Wapping to Wall Street, but this is undoubtedly her most high-profile project, and arguably the most risky. </p> <p>The Journal has a global circulation of more than two million, and although WSJ will not be available to every reader it will reach 160,000 of them in Europe and Asia and 800,00 in the US, where the Journal is a hugely revered brand. Should it fail to resonate with readers, Murdoch's critics in its home market will be quick to cite WSJ as evidence he is tinkering unnecessarily with a successful format. </p> <p>So has Gaudoin pulled it off? Probably, although the first thing many readers will notice about WSJ, apart from the arresting cover image, is the sheer volume of advertising. The list of luxury brands who have advertised in the first issues reads like the guest list for New York fashion week - Christian Dior, Chanel, Ermenegildo Zegna, Louis Vuitton, Armani, and Dolce &amp; Gabbana, to name but a few. The Journal must be raking it in, but how hard can it be to persuade these brands, for whom reaching a well-heeled audience is essential, to take space? </p> <p>'I think luxury advertisers think very carefully about where they put their money,' Gaudoin insists. 'They can't afford to throw their money around. They don't want something that looks like a catalogue.' </p> <p>WSJ avoids that trap, running lengthy pieces, including an interview with fashion designer Roland Mouret, alongside short articles about the art market and opulent holiday resorts that seem destined to become regular slots. </p> <p>Her own 'editors' picks' from the first issue include an interview with an American defence attorney who decided to become a chocolatier and an off-beat style review of airline safety videos, an idea she dreamt up on a flight back from New York after a meeting with Thomson, who she describes as 'my mentor'. </p> <p>There's also a piece about a hedge fund trader who drives very expensive racing cars in her spare time and a big interview with Indian cosmetics mogul Shahnaz Husain, prompted by a conversation with a fellow commuter who pulled out one of Husain's 'incredible kohl pencils' from her handbag on Gaudoin's long journey to work. 'I sent a Journal reporter to India. He had two hours with her and ended up staying for four days.' </p> <p>The ideas is to write about people rather than products, she says, but adds that WSJ is unlikely to include too many famous faces: 'I'm a bit anti-celebrity for celebrity's sake.' Kate Moss features in the first issue, but only because she agreed to be interviewed alongside Sir Philip Green as the billionaire retail mogul prepares to launch Topshop in the US. </p> <p>Tapping into the luxury advertising market has become something of a holy grail for business titles, although the Journal's remit is rather wider than that and Murdoch intends to broaden it still further, introducing more mainstream news and arts coverage. </p> <p>The Economist recently launched a glossy spin-off, Intelligent Life, in an attempt to lure advertisers who might not feel at home in the pages of its parent title and, in the UK, the most obvious parallel is the Financial Times's How to Spend It, a glossy weekly with articles about which wines to buy and where to pick up yachts and holiday homes. WSJ covers similar ground, but is 'a much more quirky take on our readership than you might expect', Gaudoin says.</p> <p>She is a fan of the Journal's front-page 'A-hed' column, a home for stories about cooking tips for roadkill or the disappearing holes in Swiss cheese, which, according to the paper's PR blurb, gives 'free rein to our reporters' imaginations'. </p> <p>'I had to be very aware of the Journal brand,' Gaudoin says. 'I tried to take the Journal's DNA, but I like the A-hed ethos. It's got a very wry sense of humour. Our view was that if you've got money in this climate you've got to be very pragmatic about how you spend it. But if you're going to look at this kind of lifestyle you don't want to take it too seriously.'</p> <p>Editors live or die by circulation figures, but that is one thing that Gaudoin won't have to worry about. 'The real test for us, because the Journal readers are such discerning readers - so exacting - is [their] honesty. I won't say that I'm looking forward to it, but I'm anticipating that. That for me will be the measure of our success.' </p> <p>Gaudoin briefly became something of reluctant spokeswoman for high-flying career woman struggling to juggle a family and a job when she quit unexpectedly as editor of landmark women's glossy Frank a decade ago, saying she wanted to spend more time with her young son. </p> <p>At the time, she complained that her oldest child's first words were 'daddy' and 'taxi'. She has since had a second child, but, tellingly, she can't recall what her first words were. 'I wasn't working at the time, so naturally I don't remember. It doesn't matter as much when you've not got the 'guiltymother.com' [hanging over you]. So how's her work-life balance now? 'Terrible,' she laughs. 'I dream about having a work-life balance. You can either have work or a life. Hopefully, it won't be like that for ever.'</p> <h2>Life and times</h2> <p>Gaudoin began her career as beauty editor at Tatler magazine and moved to New York in 1992 to work on the re-launch of National Magazine's Harper's Bazaar. She went on to become a senior writer at Vogue and a presenter at fashion channel Q2. She returned to London as deputy editor of Tatler and left to launch Frank, a mould-breaking, 'intelligent' woman's magazine in 1997, stepping down unexpectedly a year later. Gaudoin returned to work as editorial director of website iVillage before joining the Times as style director of the paper's Saturday magazine in 2003. Last year, she was named editor of the Times' new quarterly magazine Luxx but moved back to New York this year to become launch editor of WSJ.</p>",
  "<p>Even by the standards of the bling-obsessed United Arab Emirates, the Bugatti parked outside one of the federation's many five-star hotels was exceptional and the Emiratis, leaving their evening meals after breaking fast on the first day of Ramadan last week, were eager to have their picture taken beside it.</p> <p>The two-seater in deep burgundy with gleaming chrome engineering bore an Abu Dhabi registration plate in Arabic. Alongside, in English, the mark was translated as 'I AM 17'. This toy was not another bauble of a wealthy old sheikh; this was a birthday present for a teenager. The youth who eventually got in and drove it from the hotel forecourt to a ripple of applause from admirers looked almost embarrassed at the attention.</p> <p>I doubt he thought there was anything unusual in being given a gift worth several times more than the lifetime earnings of the Indian hotel employees whose job it is to valet-park the sports cars, limousines and top-of-the-range SUVs. The fact that an awkward adolescent could have such riches is commonplace in the Emirates, the Beverly Hills of the Middle East and the new financial powerhouse of the Gulf and the world.</p> <p>The Emirates' capital, Abu Dhabi, which has had a couple of little flutters in the global marketplace recently with billon-dollar deals in Manchester and Hollywood, is at the centre of this explosion of wealth. Its new confidence and readiness to flash the oil cash is changing the dynamic of the Gulf economies.</p> <p>One afternoon last week, the city lay snoozing quietly beneath a blanket of 42 degrees of heat, as is deemed appropriate for the holy month of fasting and charity, but it still oozed wealth. From the neck-aching ostentation of the Emirates Palace - built as a venue for an IMF meeting but now perhaps the world's most expensive hotel - to the shark-blue glass skyscraper that houses the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (cash-in-bank estimated at $1,000bn), the city was also perhaps a little embarrassed at the acres of newsprint and hours of newsreel that its latest shopping trips had sparked.</p> <p>There was some muttering that the flood of publicity sparked by the Manchester City football club deal was unsettling for an emirate that preferred to do things in a quieter, more Islamic way than its brash young brother Dubai. But Abu Dhabi and its cautious power elite will have to get used to the attention, because when you have so much cash that you can buy virtually any iconic asset in the world, from the Chrysler Building in Manhattan to a $7bn chunk of America's biggest bank Citigroup, the world will want to know about you.</p> <p>All of a sudden, the shy, conservative Islamic capital seems to have caught 'Dubai syndrome' - the urge to be bigger, higher, faster and just downright wealthier than the rest of the world. For the past 10 years, its mega-projects have been more low-key than the man-made islands and sunny pleasure domes of Dubai. Deals to bring the Louvre and the Guggenheim to the emirate were regarded as part of its role as guardian of the morality of the UAE. It was never openly said, but Dubai's hedonistic lifestyle and Western orientation were always rather frowned on in AD.</p> <p>Suleiman al-Fahim, the 31-year-old property executive behind the Manchester City deal, is an example of the new generation of entrepreneurs who are adding a touch of Dubai-style bling to AD's huge financial resources. From comparatively humble origins, he made his name in property in Dubai before being spotted by the AD real-estate power brokers and brought under the wing of the ruling family as part of the royal conglomerate that operates the private business interests of the al-Nahyans, the family that runs the UAE under the 60- year-old Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed.</p> <p>But al-Fahim was not part of one of the old trading families of the UAE. Its commercial life has been dominated by a string of business dynasties, many of them descendants of immigrants from the Arabian parts of southern Iran in the 1920s. Al-Futtaim, al-Ansari, al-Tayer and al-Sayegh - names as prominent in the UAE as Marks &amp; Spencer or WH Smith in Britain - were allowed to dominate commercial life in the UAE, in exchange for profit-sharing arrangements with the ruling Emirati elite. </p> <p>With the region's long trading ties with business families from India and Pakistan, these groups combined to fuel the commercial life of the UAE after independence from Britain in 1972, importing the cars, engineering equipment, electronic and other consumer goods.</p> <p>The Emirati owners had long been used to a system of rentier income, first from pearl fishing concessions, then from aircraft landing rights under the British on the long flight from Europe to south Asia and then from oil. The result was a culture of indolence and inertia. The ruling Maktoums and Nahyans in effect handed over the running of the economy to expatriates and immigrants, and to foreign energy companies, in return for the cash generated by those businesses.</p> <p>For an Emirati, this arrangement funded a cocooned lifestyle where all needs were met from cradle to grave. Education, healthcare and basic welfare are provided free for Emirati nationals; marriage (to other Emiratis only) was encouraged by financial assistance for house-building and children; work was provided in government institutions and the banking industry. The Economist recently said such a system encouraged a society of 'licensed layabouts', and it is true that the work-life balance of many Emiratis seems heavily oriented towards 'quality time'. A well-paid job in one of the government departments, short hours and a government-subsidised private life does not gel well with the idea of a thrusting entrepreneurial society.</p> <p>That is changing and AD's new high profile is proof of the transformation. The governments - first in Dubai, but increasingly in AD - began to fast-track young men and women who showed signs of business talent, putting them through Western universities and business schools and then letting them loose on underperforming UAE businesses. Al-Fahim is a product of this process.</p> <p>With this comes a change in lifestyle. Dubai has catered for Western tastes for decades, with five-star hotels and restaurants allowed to serve alcohol and run nightclubs where anything goes, as long as it stays off the streets and beaches. But AD is catching up. It is not uncommon now to see young Emiratis - sometimes in long, flowing robes but with back-to-front baseball cap - propping up hotel bars and chatting to vivacious young women. Weekends consist of beach excursions where Islamic conventions are largely ignored. Many young Emirati women, usually seen in the full-length black abaya during the week, will be in bikinis at weekends. This trend has been reinforced by the influx of young, fun-loving Lebanese. The Lebanese and their Emirati hosts now strut the luxury shopping malls with equal assurance - but it is the Emiratis who carry the Vuitton or Cartier bags and get into the chauffeured limos afterwards.</p> <p>But beneath all that outward modernity and extravagance, the UAE remains a fundamentally, if not fundamentalist, Islamic society. The Emirates were always more liberal than their Wahhabi-dominated neighbours in Saudi Arabia, but its rulers have always remained profoundly Islamic.</p> <p>Abu Dhabi bows to Mecca in more than the physical sense. When plans for the Sheikh Zayed Mosque were unveiled, showing it to be the biggest in the world, Abu Dhabi scaled back the design after Mecca pointed out that the honour should remain with the city of the Prophet. Mosques are built with government funds and imams are licensed and monitored by the government. </p> <p>This tug between religion and Westernisation is evidence that the UAE is the most successful experiment in the world of the co-existence of Islam with other beliefs, but there are downsides. Many Emiratis - who number perhaps less than 10 per cent of the expat-dominated population - feel under siege. One Emirati friend told me how he did not worry about Europeans or Americans living in the UAE, because they were there to help the country grow, but, he added ominously, 'the Asians, they want to take over and we will not have that'. The government has recently initiated a debate on Emirati national identity in an effort to halt what it sees as a corrosion of traditional cultural values, and there is a danger this could become a new Emirati chauvinism. </p> <p>At the crux of the matter is oil and the corrupting effect the commodity has on countries blessed with it but cursed to suffer the destabilising consequences. Abu Dhabi sits on 9 per cent of the world's oil reserves and 15 per cent of the gas supplies - and with oil still above $100 a barrel there is no sign the financial engine will lose momentum. Recent estimates indicate that the UAE's energy supplies will last another 100 years.</p> <p>Dubai, meanwhile, has more or less run out of oil. The seven-star hotels, artificial palm islands, cavernous malls and mega-airports are all intended to diversify it away from oil dependence. Judging by the evidence all round the booming city, it is working, though whether Dubai will substitute property dependence for oil addiction is still hotly debated. </p> <p>Al-Fahim said after the Manchester City deal that it was designed to bring 'glory' to Abu Dhabi, and this is perhaps the best way to see it. The investment is unlikely to show a real return in financial terms, but if City knocks its neighbour United off the perch to become the biggest football club in the world the reflected glory for Abu Dhabi will be well worth it. If it also demonstrates a serious sporting commitment and helps the UAE win the right to stage the Olympics or the World Cup in the next 20 years, even a billion-dollar investment will seem money well spent. And for the foreseeable future the UAE has money to burn.</p> <h2>Abu Dhabi's big deals</h2> <p><strong>Manchester City</strong><br>Abu Dhabi's royal family made a \u00a3210m takeover - headed by Sulaiman al Fahim - of Premier League team Manchester City last week. The next day Brazilian star Robinho was purchased from Real Madrid for \u00a332m.

  "<p>Scotland travel to Iceland for Wednesday's World Cup qualifier with the intention of proving that LP Hartley was mistaken when he observed that the past is a foreign country, where they do things differently. </p> <p>With an impeccable record of four victories from four meetings with their Group 9 opponents from the north Atlantic, George Burley's players will surely bridle at the prospect of transforming an honourable history into an ignominious present. </p> <p>Given the national team manager's prescribed target of 17 points from the eight matches in the series that should ensure at least second place in the section, the Scots require as many as they can muster at the Laugardalsvollur Stadium, the second leg of the opening double-header of away matches that began with yesterday's trip to Macedonia. </p> <p>After the heat of Skopje, the cool, late summer temperature of Reykjavik should provide a more familiar environment for players whose experiences in the domestic game over the past few weeks will have created the illusion that they had already arrived at the late stages of autumn. </p> <p>The venue was also the scene of one of the very few highlights of the generally depressing era of Berti Vogts, the 2-0 victory there in the Euro 2004 qualifier five-and-a-half years ago having been secured in the match that followed the scandalous 2-2 draw in the Faroes that had opened Scotland's campaign. </p> <p>Steven Pressley, the former Rangers, Hearts and Celtic central defender who is now an assistant coach with the national team, will doubtless appraise the present members of the squad of the desirability of regarding Iceland as a place to be anticipated with a certain relish. It was undoubtedly the scene of his confirmation as an international player who would amass a total of 32 caps. </p> <p>Pressley had made two appearances as a substitute in 2000, when he was summoned by Vogts for the Iceland match as a result of David Weir's decision to quit the international game in the wake of the Faroes debacle. Weir had been publicly held culpable by Vogts and would remain in self-imposed exile until recalled by Walter Smith on the latter's succession of the hapless German. </p> <p>'Before that opening match in the Faroes, I had struggled with a back injury through the summer and had also missed the trip to Hong Kong for friendly games,' said Pressley. 'So I wasn't in Berti's thoughts for the Faroes, but obviously the result forced a change of plan for Berti and opened the door for me. I was called in immediately after, when Davie left. It turned out to be a very good day for us, as we won 2-0 and Christian [Dailly] and Gary [Naysmith] scored our goals. </p> <p>'I think, because of the poor performance and results in Toftir and the severe criticism the team had taken, I had sort of been hailed as some kind of savi our - can you imagine that? People were expecting me to make a major impact and, fortunately, as things often do in football, it worked out well. </p> <p>'It's not the only happy memory I have of Iceland, though, as I also played a Uefa Cup tie there for Hearts against IBV of the Westmann Islands. We won that game 2-0 as well, and then 3-0 back at Tynecastle. This time we're going there at a good time of year, still in the Icelandic summer, and the conditions will be fine.' </p> <p>With the injury-enforced defection of the Preston full-back, Callum Davidson, from the squad, Naysmith is the only survivor from the match in March 2003. Pressley, however, is convinced of a significant difference between the previous group and the one that will be on duty on Wednesday. </p> <p>'It's always difficult to tell if we have a better standard of player between one era and another,' he said. 'But I look at this squad now and I think we have a group of players who genuinely believe they should be playing at the top level. I think that is the most obvious and most significant change in the past few years. </p> <p>'You have players operating regularly at the top level. Darren Fletcher at Manchester United, a number of younger players at Celtic and Rangers emerging and players in England. There is no inferiority complex with these guys and that mental strength is such an important aspect of the modern game. </p> <p>'The real benefit of what they experience at the clubs is that they are mostly at places where constantly winning is expected and they are used to that pressure and develop the self-belief to handle it. They believe we can go to these places, like Iceland, and win the matches. </p> <p>'It a question of their being exposed to high expectations for their supporters at club level and learning how to cope with it. And it's the same when playing for Scotland, because the nation expects.'</p>",
  "<p>Last weekend, at Zagreb's Maksimir Stadium, the place England will revisit on Wednesday night praying for a less harrowing experience than their last trip, a league game took place between Croatian Champions Dinamo and Varteks. The crowd of little more than a couple of thousand rattled around inside what can be an intimidating bear pit holding 40,000. </p> <p>The success of Croatia's national team, which can be measured by their being number five in the world rankings (10 places above England) and the guarantee of sell-out support from one of the most boisterous crowds in Europe, is an enduring enigma. </p> <p>The country's footballing infrastructure is incredibly low-key. The domestic league is nothing special. Matches are poorly attended, with average crowds of around 3,000, even though a ticket to watch the Dinamo-Varteks match costs less than watching a Conference team in England. Clubs generate television money and sponsorship deals the Abu Dhabi United Group would barely regard as spare change. </p> <p>International overachievers in spite of an unloved, underfunded league, Croatia are the absolute antithesis of England. </p> <p>According to Uefa's table of European leagues, England are top, Croatia 26th. It is no use whinging that Fabio Capello's team should be stronger than they are because the Premier League is revered around the world and all of Capello's picks bar one play in it. Croatia are a brilliant example of why the relationship between the domestic and international game is tenuous. England has 1.5m registered players; Croatia has around 100,000, but it does not mean a thing when you are down to your best XI. </p> <p>One of the chants belted out by the red-and-white-chequered masses sums it up neatly: 'We are little,' they yell, 'but we are many.' </p> <p>Igor Stimac, once much loved at Derby County and a veteran of Croatia's golden generation that came third at the World Cup a decade ago, is a man on a mission to redress the imbalance between the two faces of Croatian football. Last year he was appointed president of the league and vice-president of the football federation. </p> <p>'Because of the talent we have in all sports here, we can sustain a high level in the national team. But our facilities are poor,' he says. 'We have wonderful games in our league, but you see 4,000 people in a stadium with no toilet if they have a need. And you know from England if there are no facilities it is the best possible place for hooligans to go. They are the minority - we have probably 100 or 150 hooligans in the whole of Croatia - but they are noisy and produce terrible things. </p> <p>'We have to invest now. A few new stadiums will really help. We want to give people who like to come to football a comfortable environment where they can bring their kids.' </p> <p>Stimac has been working hard to bring new money into the sport. The budget has increased from \u20ac900,000 (\u00a3727,000) a year - to be spread over the whole league - to almost \u20ac4m (\u00a33.2m). A new television deal has been struck with dedicated football slots created to boost interest. </p> <p>Although Stimac is not expecting the kind of overseas benefactors who flock to England to turn their attention to Croatia, he is convinced football in his country is fit for some juicy investment. The laws have recently changed to allow private interests to take over clubs. According to Stimac, it will take a lot less than the price of Robinho to transform one of Croatia's top two into a Champions League contender. </p> <p>'For Hajduk Split and Dinamo Zagreb, our two biggest clubs, one investor needs only to put in \u20ac30 million to succeed - far less than elsewhere. </p> <p>'We have a wish to be recognised as a football country. Our national team is at the top of the list, but our clubs are not. The Champions League is only a place for the richest clubs and that is not right for me. Michel Platini mentioned he wants to bring football back to small countries. We are happy with that.' </p> <p>Stimac has fond memories of playing in the continent's premier competition: 'I played for Hajduk in the Champions League. Then as champions of Croatia we played only one qualifier. In the 1994-1995 competition we beat Legia Warsaw and then we went on to reach the quarter-finals, where we lost to Ajax, who went on to become champions of Europe. Dinamo had a couple of attempts in the late 1990s, but since then we haven't had an easy time. With three qualification games now it is hard to avoid meeting one of the big teams.' </p> <p>That has an obvious knock-on effect in terms of standards in the league. Seeing players such as Luka Modric follow in the footsteps of Eduardo da Silva and Vedran Corluka in heading to the Premier League - all in their twenties - is a prize for the national team but a blow for the domestic game. The best young players are routinely poached by foreign clubs. 'If we invest in our infrastructure we can hold on to them for longer, I am certain,' says Stimac. </p> <p>Ever the positive thinker, Stimac argues that the low-level league is actually a strength for the national team. 'We are not a country in a position to choose 20 out of 150 quality players. That's all we've got. But those 20 players are wonderful. Croatia has been working with the same group of players for the past five years. It's like a family. It never matters how they play for their clubs. </p> <p>'We don't need to change, or call up new players for each game. That's a problem for England because if you want to be successful with the national team, you shouldn't have to change the team so often. There is no way you can have continuity and, psychologically, that's not good.' </p> <p>Stimac is looking forward to another 'wonderful' game against England, having seen his compatriots follow their humiliation of Steve McClaren's team in Zagreb with a historic victory at the new Wembley. </p> <p>'I think we will win,' he says. 'I don't think England has composure or looks dangerous. In fact, I don't remember the last time I saw England play well. And you probably know Croatia never lost a single game in Zagreb. If Eduardo was fit I'd say 100 per cent Croatia will win by two or three goals. We've still got enough quality players and the atmosphere in the team gives us a big chance.' </p> <p>Naturally, with the World Cup draw pairing these two countries again, recent wounds may be reopened. </p> <p>It is worth recalling the gory details of England's last visit to Zagreb. Gary Neville's innocuous backpass somehow jinked over Paul Robinson's attempted hoof upfield and the Maksimir crowd erupted into a combination of celebration and hilarity. 'Oh my goodness...' barked an alarmed Martin Tyler on the commentary, 'have you ever seen anything like that?' Indeed. </p> <p>Neville froze, rooted to the spot. Robinson kicked a divot as if the piece of turf had thrown him a disgusting personal insult. While England confronted a grim fate, the face of Borat, memorably, flashed across the advertising hoardings. McClaren looked deep into his notebook for an answer. The image of him scribbling mere seconds after Croatia's mind-boggling goal remains the second most defining image of his tenure as England manager after the Wembley umbrella. We can expect no such nonsense from Capello. </p> <p>The form book hardly suggests England can this time do what no team have ever done at Maksimir - come out of the away dressing room for a competitive game and win. But might there be cracks that can be exploited this time? Croatia are missing two influential players in Arsenal's Eduardo and Portsmouth's Niko Kranjcar. More worryingly, other important players are not getting regular games for their clubs. The Kovac brothers, who are regarded as rocks for Croatia, badly need some match practice. Robert is not playing at all for Borussia Dortmund, while Niko is coming back from injury - not the easiest thing to do at the age of 36.</p> <p>Josip Simunic, the player made infamous by the triple booking awarded to him by Graham Poll at the 2006 World Cup, also struggles for a club start at Hertha Berlin. That said, the players are typically cocksure. 'Just come here and we'll give you a lesson,' said Ivan Klasnic last week. </p> <p>And what of the pitch? Has the groundsman, as one Croatian journalist pointed out with a smile, been working day and night to pamper the grass?</p> <p>The last word goes to Stimac, who was one of those defenders who combined an iron tackle with a warm, gentlemanly, disarming smile. 'The first rule of defending is when you pass back to the goalkeeper you pass away from goal,' he says smoothly. 'Everybody knows that.'</p>",
  "<p>The king is dead. Where is the king? It was only four months ago that Lawrence Dallaglio led Wasps to Premiership glory here amid the most emotional of scenes. The talismanic back-row forward, who captained his club with such distinction for more than a decade, has departed from the greensward and Wasps were a shadow of a side without him.</p> <p>The champions were outfought and outthought at every turn by a London Irish team who were quicker of mind and fleeter of foot and who thoroughly deserved a victory that was orchestrated by Mike Catt, pulling the strings from fly-half, and Nick Kennedy, who enjoyed a barnstorming gamed in the engine room. Two late, opportunist tries by Tom Rees and Eoin Reddan merely served to flatter Wasps, who were shapeless and rudderless for much of a game that they will wish to forget in a hurry.</p> <p>This was also, of course, the first match in which the experimental law variations - or ELVs, as they are more commonly known - were on show in the Premiership as part of a global year-long trial. Certainly it will take some time for players and officials to get used to them, and time will be the judge of whether they have been a success. The majority of them appear fair enough, such as the introduction of an offside line five metres behind the back foot of a set scrum and being able to throw backwards when taking a quick line-out. Also, there is now no gain in territory if the ball is passed back into a team's 22 and then kicked directly into touch. Fair enough.</p> <p>Additionally, there is now no restriction in the numbers that either side are permitted to employ at the line-out, which is dubious at best. But the ELV that really wrankles is the one that allows a defending side to pull down a maul. Absolute, complete and total madness. The maul is an intrinsic and valuable part of the game of rugby union - and the sooner the chumps that forced it through see the error of their ways the better.</p> <p>Moving on from that little rant, meanwhile, it was the Exiles who were first on the scoreboard in the eighth minute. And an interesting try it was, too. Not so much because Kennedy, who toured New Zealand with England in the summer, did outstandingly well to get a fingertip to a Raphael Iba\u00f1ez throw on a Wasps five-metre line-out, thereby causing Simon Shaw to palm the ball back loosely. It was interesting because Wasps used only five men at the line-out, compared with Irish's seven. And it cost them dear as Chris Hala'Ufia, the Tonga No 8 who was making his debut for the Irish, scooped up the ball and flopped over from short range. </p> <p>It was a touchdown that served to invigorate Irish, who dominated the rest of the first period, even though they were temporarily without Hala'Ufia, who was sent to the cooler for deliberately tripping Reddan after the Wasps scrum-half had taken a quick tap penalty. The Exiles actually extended their lead in his absence when Peter Hewat slotted a penalty from in front of the posts after his own searing run had turned the Wasps defence inside and out.</p> <p>With Catt keeping the opposition defence on the back foot with some intelligent kicking into open spaces and getting his backline moving to good effect with some typically adroit distribution, it was the Exiles who looked more like the defending champions. Sailosi Tagicakibau, the Samoa wing, was a handful every time he got the ball - and he saw plenty of it.</p> <p>In fact, Wasps were dire in the first period, creating very little of note in attack and allowing the Exiles to break over the gainline almost at will. Quite what Ian McGeechan and Shaun Edwards, the Wasps coaching team, said to their charges at half-time, by when Hewat had added a second penalty to increase the lead to 13-0, is anyone's guess. But it will not have been of the 'keep it up, chaps' variety, that's for sure.</p> <p>Their charges obviously weren't listening. After Delon Armitage had narrowly missed with a penalty attempt from just inside his own half, Richard Thorpe, the Exiles' blindside, broke through a couple of limp tackles directly from a line-out to help extend the Irish lead to 20-0, and that was just about that. Rees, who was one of the better Wasps players, strolled to the line on the hour mark after the ball had squirted out of a ruck on the Irish 22, but the trusty boot of Hewat kept the champions, who were slightly improved after the resumption, at arm's length.</p> <p>Did the ELVs make a difference? They certainly allowed more time and space for the attacking side at scrum time, which was a positive thing, and the tempo of the game, which was by no means a classic, was not dissimilar to a typical Premiership match last season. But there was precious little mauling. And that was sad.</p> <p><strong>Twickenham </strong>52,087</p> <p><strong>LONDON IRISH </strong>Hewat; Ojo, D Armitage, Mapusua, Tagicakibau; Catt (capt; Hickey 67), Hodgson </p> <p>(Richards 74); Corbisiero (Murphy 48), Coetzee </p> <p>(Paice 61), Rautenbach (Corbisiero 61; Buckland 78), Johnson, Kennedy, Thorpe, S Armitage, Hala'Ufia (Fisher 80)</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Hala'ufia, Thorpe <strong>Cons</strong> Hewat 2 <strong>Pens</strong> Hewat 4</p> <p><strong>WASPS </strong>Van Gisbergen (Mitchell 70); Sackey, Waldouck, Lewsey (Staunton ht), Voyce; Flutey, Reddan; Payne, Iba\u00f1ez (capt; Webber 70), Barnard (Vickery 52), Shaw, Birkett (Palmer 52), Worsley, Rees, Haskell (Hart 61)</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Rees, Reddan <strong>Cons</strong> Van Gisbergen, Staunton</p>",
  "<p>Bravo to Lily Allen for telling Elton John to 'F-off' while they were co-hosting the GQ awards. She seems to be regretting it (her Facebook page says she's 'dying inside'), but it sounds hilarious: Lily guzzling champagne and swearing while announcing winners; Elton becoming increasingly angry about her alcohol consumption, taking her aside for stern words before finally making a waspish comment in front of the audience.</p> <p>At which point, Lily said: 'Fuck off, Elton, I am 40 years younger than you and have my whole life ahead of me.' Elton spluttered back: 'I could still snort you under the table.' A fine riposte, but it was too late - the former coke/sex/whatever fiend turned self-styled saviour of celebrity souls had finally and most unambiguously been told where to get off. And with all due respect Mr John, not before time.</p> <p>Admittedly, Lily, who says she and Elton are friends, didn't exhibit the classiest of behaviour, but who does when they're roaring drunk and 23? Anyway, she made a good point. What is Elton if not a prime example of a group I've long identified as Born Again Prims? It's fine for them to misspend their youths in a blizzard of sex, cocaine and debauchery. However, after they've hit middle age and 'reformed', they seemingly dedicate their lives to trying to stop other, mainly younger, people enjoying their own wild years.</p> <p>It wouldn't matter so much, but Elton, a musical hero of mine, has form. George Michael found himself described by Elton as 'in a strange place [with] a deep-rooted unhappiness in his life' in the respected psychiatric publication Heat magazine. Robbie Williams has told of how 'weird' it felt to be frogmarched to rehab by Elton. Donatella Versace, Pete Doherty and Rufus Wainwright are all alleged recipients of what appears to be the Elton John Rehab Pyramid Scheme.</p> <p>One has to ask: who do Elton John and his husband David Furnish think they are, mooching about 'saving' people? It's as if they've become the Jehovah's Witnesses of celebrity sobriety, with everyone scared to open the door to them in case they get a fat lecture and a 12-step pamphlet. Imagine how a decadent celebrity's heart might plummet when they see that pair coming round the corner with their Holland &amp; Barrett bags of multivitamins. They probably hide behind the sofa, thinking: 'I've spent all my money on drugs, my career is over, my nose has gone all Danielle Westbrook, but I really must have hit rock bottom if Elton and David want to help.'</p> <p>Elton is not the only one. Most famously, Madonna has been much given in recent years to opining that daughter Lourdes will not be watching TV, eating ice cream or dating boys before the age of 18. Such moral rigidity, from a woman who once simulated masturbation onstage as a choreographed part of her act and cavorted with her front botty hanging out in the hilarious, much underrated book, Sex</p> <p>It doesn't have to be this way. Rock band Aerosmith were, if anything, wilder than Elton, but are clean living these days, with group members looking as if they're only held together by very weak Sellotape. They don't nag younger stars about sobriety and rehab programmes, but unfortunately they may be the exception.</p> <p>The only thing more boring than yet another picture of a 'tired and emotional' Amy Winehouse staggering about in a stained bra and pants buying ice pops at 4.30 in the morning is the thought of the tedious interviews she may give when she finally gets clean, droning away in fluent 'Californian' about 'finding herself, accepting she has a problem, blah blah. I want to warn all young people about the dangers of drugs, alcohol and having hair like a giant backcombed merkin'. The point is that maybe they don't want, or need, to be warned.</p> <p>Even five years ago, I was thinking there simply can't be a young person in Britain today, in the entertainment industry or otherwise, so thick as to think 'copious amounts of alcohol and class A drugs are a good and healthy choice for me'. Therefore, in 2008, surely any attempt to educate, change or indeed bombard them with censure, disdain and unasked-for advice at an awards ceremony would surely be the height of pointlessness.</p> <p>This is the great unwritten law of hedonism: listen to yourself, because only you will recognise the moment when you've had that magical amount 'enough'. The rest is just premature middle age forced upon you by elders who, with their pasts, shouldn't be throwing GQ awards in glasshouses. Lily was right the first time - Elton has had his fun, now it's her turn and, from where I'm sitting, she's a damn sight better behaved than he used to be.</p> <h2>If your lower limbs are beginning to wither and you're becoming dangerously obese, blame Google</h2> <p>Considering that Google is now 10 years old, how come we don't all hate it? Used by 70 per cent of browsers, worth \u00a375bn, Google seems to have somehow sidestepped the automatic global brand hatred of, say, a Microsoft or McDonald's. </p> <p>Simple, free, reliable, with adverts subtle enough not to drive you potty, Google is not only a design classic of web technology, but it appears to be our search engine friend. Why, then, do I suspect that it wants to rewire my brain and then eat it?</p> <p>It's not that there's anything bad or inefficient about Google; on the contrary, it might be too good. The better it gets, the more I seem to turn into a spoon-fed idiot who couldn't survive in the real world. As it is, I can't do much without using Google any more. I've noticed this before: whether it is finding a restaurant, sourcing products or fact-checking, I'm either Googling or I'm lost. </p> <p>This can't be healthy. Talking of which, I'm starting to wonder if Google may be guiltier than McDonald's of aggravating global obesity. On the one hand, a Big Mac with fries; on the other, barely having to move a muscle while doing things that used to entail days of sweaty exertion. I've just been organising my daughter's birthday party and all I've done is Google internet sites and - ooh, the effort - reach for a bankcard. </p> <p>Did I used to be this lazy? Well, yes, but only when I could get away with it. Now, because of Google, I nearly always get away with it. </p> <p>Indeed, I've got a terrible fear that one day I'll get off my chair and just fall to the floor, because my legs will have been rendered evolutionarily unnecessary for my ultra-sedentary Google lifestyle. They'll wither and, in their place, I'll grow two giant forefingers with which to type 'Google', and a flesh version of one of those festival hats with cans and straws. My corpse will be found in years to come, stuck fast to the keyboard, my eyes open, screaming their own terrible story. </p> <p>Is this Google's fiendish plot, to render us all helpless and dependent, then take over the world? How can we stop them? By Googling 'How to stop Google'? This needs earnestly debating before the next 10 years are up. Where's that nice David Icke when you need him?</p> <h2>Apparently, it's not in their jeans, it's in their genes</h2> <p>Grazia magazine ran a moving story last week about Tanya Rowe, 28, who is suffering from breast cancer and has only months to live. Tanya was trying to be strong and positive, despite her heartache at leaving behind son Charlie and fiance Jason, whom she'd just recently met, but who had asked her to be his wife despite her illness, and even offered to care for Charlie after her death. </p> <p>Last week, Grazia ran a follow up. Jason's other girlfriend had seen the article and rung Tanya. According to Tanya, Jason's reason for cheating was: 'It's been really tough on me with your illness. You've given me no emotional support.' Quite. It's all 'me, me, me' with these terminal cancer sufferers, isn't it? </p> <p>Understandably, Tanya does not want to waste the precious time she has left hating Jason, so I thought I'd do it for her. However, just as I was settling into a pleasant daydream imagining Jason being plunged headfirst into a cauldron of boiling oil, amid the flames of a karmic hell, a newspaper article caught my eye.</p> <p>According to a study by the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, certain men may be genetically programmed to be unfaithful. In what has been hailed as the 'divorce gene', it's all to with some hormonal bonding thingie called vasopressin being out of synch. So, according to the study, these unfaithful men (not women strangely) are hormonally fated to cheat on their partners and seek sex elsewhere. </p> <p>The article had some other points about how genetics was never the full story (some unsubstantiated guff about how, nevertheless, there is still personal responsibility for one's actions), but I'm afraid I stopped reading there. It was all too much. I mean, Jason, if you're reading, you tell me: does male suffering never end?</p>",
  "<p>Sauvignon blanc is an extremely popular variety making crisp, dry, aromatic and very distinctive wines all over the world, excelling in cooler climates. Many people favour its crisp acidity over the soft butteriness of a lot of chardonnays. The smell is sharp (unlike that of chardonnay) and reminds different tasters variously of gooseberries, nettles, crushed blackcurrant leaves and occasionally tomcats (yes, it has been likened to the smell of cat's pee). With age, aromas reminiscent of canned asparagus can develop.</p> <p>The smell of sauvignon (which is most of its character) is relatively simple, and it smells and tastes remarkably similar wherever it is planted. So, like gewurztramine, it is a very good starting point for learning to recognise different varieties. Some sauvignon blanc can last for several years in bottle, but very little actually improves - vibrant young fruitiness with refreshment value, rather than subtlety, is sauvignon's strong suit. </p> <h2>France</h2> <p>Sauvignon blanc's French stronghold is the upper Loire, in particular the twin appellations of Sancerre and Pouilly-Fum\u00e9. It is here that sauvignon is found in its purest form. The best examples of these wines are drier, denser and slower-maturing than most new world sauvignon blanc, and the best genuinely express terroir with nuances dependent on the proportion of gravel and flint in the soil. Sauvignon is also grown widely downstream, notably to produce oceans of sauvignon de Touraine which, from the bestproducers, can be good value - as can the Sancerre-like wines of less famous Menetou-Salon, Reuilly and Quincy. </p> <p>Sauvignon is even more widely planted in Bordeaux and Bergerac, although it is less important here than the fatter semillon with which it is commonly blended - as elsewhere - to produce both dry wines (particularly in Pessac-L\u00e9ognan, Graves and Entre-Deux-Mers) and sweet (in Sauternes, Monbazillac and surrounds). Sauvignon supplies the aroma and acidity in greater Bordeaux's whites, and the more expensive dry wines are often aged in small oak barrels. Sauvignon and oak can be an oily mixture unless managed with a very deft hand.</p> <h2>New Zealand</h2> <p>Sauvignon blanc overtook chardonnay in New Zealand in 2003, and this relatively tiny wine industry can boast twice as much sauvignon as Australia and significantly more than either the Loire or Bordeaux. New Zealand has been so successful with its pungently herbaceous style of sauvignon blanc, heady with the tropical fruit smells of a cool, prolonged fermentation, that winemakers throughout the new and old world, especially in Chile, South Africa and the Languedoc, are now emulating it. In some vintages, fruit is deliberately picked underripe, ripe and overripe to bring different characteristics to the final blend. Marlborough, at the north end of the South Island, is New Zealand's, possibly now the world's, sauvignon capital. </p> <h2>Chile</h2> <p>Casablanca and San Antonio valleys, close to the Pacific coast, may have the potential to do the same job for Chile. Two of the coolest and newest wine regions in Chile, they are the only ones to be planted substantially with sauvignon blanc rather than the less distinctive sauvignonasse. The majority of vines originally called sauvignon by the Chileans are very likely sauvignonasse, or sauvignon vert, and occasionally sauvignon gris, rather than sauvignon blanc. </p> <h2>Elsewhere</h2> <p>In Europe, sauvignon is a speciality of Rueda in Spain, Styria in Austria and Collio in north-east Italy. Some German speakers call it muskat-silvaner. South Africa makes some delicious sauvignon blanc, perhaps because the vine has had so long to accustom itself to local conditions (it was widely planted there in the 19th century). Much of Australia is too warm for the preservation of sauvignon blanc's characteristically \"green\" (ie slightly underripe) aroma, but some fine examples have emerged from the Adelaide Hills. Sauvignon blanc has enjoyed enormous success in California since the 1980s. The state generally produces a distinct, full-bodied, often oak-aged version, and the variety has also sparkled in Texas and Washington.</p> <h2>Victoria Moore recommends</h2> <p><strong>One to drink now</strong></p> <p><strong>Radcliffe's Sauvignon Blanc</strong><br><strong>Haut-Poitou 2007, VDQS France \u00a37.49, or \u00a34.99 on the 3 for 2 <br>deal, Threshers</strong><br> This has all the hallmarks of a Loire sauvignon blanc - the fresh-mown grass scent, nettley green notes and mountain stream freshness - but it's from a VDQS (a quality level between AOC and vin de pays) just to the south of <br>the great river, so commands a lower price. </p> <p><strong>One to lust after</strong><br> <br><strong>Blind River 2007 Marlborough, New Zealand</strong> <br><strong>\u00a310.99, Oddbins</strong><br> <br>Boisterous, full of itself and with a smell of passion fruit and ripe melons, there is no mistaking the origin of this high-impact sauvignon blanc.

  "<p>People should have one meat-free day a week if they want to make a personal and effective sacrifice that would help tackle climate change, the world's leading authority on global warming has told The Observer</p> <p>Dr Rajendra Pachauri, chair of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which last year earned a joint share of the Nobel Peace Prize, said that people should then go on to reduce their meat consumption even further.</p> <p>His comments are the most controversial advice yet provided by the panel on how individuals can help tackle global warning. </p> <p>Pachauri, who was re-elected the panel's chairman for a second six-year term last week, said diet change was important because of the huge greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental problems - including habitat destruction - associated with rearing cattle and other animals. It was relatively easy to change eating habits compared to changing means of transport, he said. </p> <p>The UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation has estimated that meat production accounts for nearly a fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions. These are generated during the production of animal feeds, for example, while ruminants, particularly cows, emit methane, which is 23 times more effective as a global warming agent than carbon dioxide. The agency has also warned that meat consumption is set to double by the middle of the century.</p> <p>'In terms of immediacy of action and the feasibility of bringing about reductions in a short period of time, it clearly is the most attractive opportunity,' said Pachauri. 'Give up meat for one day [a week] initially, and decrease it from there,' said the Indian economist, who is a vegetarian. </p> <p>However, he also stressed other changes in lifestyle would help to combat climate change. 'That's what I want to emphasise: we really have to bring about reductions in every sector of the economy.'</p> <p>Pachauri can expect some vociferous responses from the food industry to his advice, though last night he was given unexpected support by Masterchef presenter and restaurateur John Torode, who is about to publish a new book, John Torode's Beef. 'I have a little bit and enjoy it,' said Torode. 'Too much for any person becomes gluttony. But there's a bigger issue here: where [the meat] comes from. If we all bought British and stopped buying imported food we'd save a huge amount of carbon emissions.'</p> <p>Tomorrow, Pachauri will speak at an event hosted by animal welfare group <a href=\"http://www.ciwf.org.uk/\">Compassion in World Farming</a>, which has calculated that if the average UK household halved meat consumption that would cut emissions more than if car use was cut in half. </p> <p>The group has called for governments to lead campaigns to reduce <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/07/food.beef\">meat consumption</a> by 60 per cent by 2020. Campaigners have also pointed out the health benefits of eating less meat. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/07/food.meat\">The average person in the UK eats 50g of protein from meat a day</a>, equivalent to a chicken breast and a lamb chop - a relatively low level for rich nations but 25-50 per cent more than World Heath Organisation guidelines.</p> <p>Professor Robert Watson, the chief scientific adviser for the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs, who will also speak at tomorrow's event in London, said government could help educate people about the benefits of eating less meat, but it should not 'regulate'. 'Eating less meat would help, there's no question about that, but there are other things,' Watson said.</p> <p>However, Chris Lamb, head of marketing for pig industry group BPEX, said the meat industry had been unfairly targeted and was working hard to find out which activities had the biggest environmental impact and reduce those. Some ideas were contradictory, he said - for example, one solution to emissions from livestock was to keep them indoors, but this would damage animal welfare. 'Climate change is a very young science and our view is there are a lot of simplistic solutions being proposed,' he said.</p> <p>Last year a major report into the environmental impact of meat eating by the Food Climate Research Network at Surrey University claimed livestock generated 8 per cent of UK emissions - but eating some meat was good for the planet because some habitats benefited from grazing. It also said vegetarian diets that included lots of milk, butter and cheese would probably not noticeably reduce emissions because dairy cows are a major source of methane, a potent greenhouse gas released through flatulence.</p>",
  "<p>On a sultry evening in Manhattan last month, Joseph O'Neill was to be found in the cool downtown atmosphere of the independent SoHo bookstore McNally Jackson. The occasion was a party thrown for the store's renaming (it had previously been called McNally Robinson), a champagne affair with a guest list and a doorman. A slew of hip young writers was present, but O'Neill, a trim, saturnine figure with the welcoming smile of someone familiar with anonymity, was the main attraction. In T-shirt, shorts and untied pumps, he looked like that most uncommon of urban creatures: a relaxed author. In front of him was a queue of readers - mostly young women - eager to gain his signature on their copies of his book, and all around him was the pleasing and unmistakable buzz of success.</p> <p>This is the celebrity version of the literary life: the fashionable event, the limelight, the approbation. But O'Neill, an Irishman of Turkish descent who grew up in Holland and went to university in England, is far more intimate with the other version: the long days and dark nights that form the basis of the creative process, and the quiet, frustrating obscurity of the unread author. His two previous novels, and a memoir, had slipped almost unnoticed into the bottomless void in which nearly all books sooner or later - and mostly sooner - come to reside.</p> <p>'I'd never met a disinterested third party who'd read my work,' he told me. But here, as at various readings he had attended in recent weeks, there was one big party of unknown readers lining up to tell him how much they loved his book. New York magazine had already declared O'Neill 'King of New York', and he was to be seen on video screens in the back of yellow cabs being interviewed about the cause of all the fanfare, his third novel, Netherland, the current favourite to win the Man Booker prize.</p> <p>Courtesy of his education at an international school in the Hague and Cambridge University (where he read law), O'Neill sounds like an impeccable Englishman. As if to complete the effect, he also worked until 1998 as a barrister in that most English of establishments, the Temple. Now 44, he has been living in New York for the past decade. Seven of those years he spent working on Netherland, ostensibly a slim novel concerning the small world of New York cricket. When eventually the book was finished, he was turned down by a number of agents and then, having secured an agent, he was rejected by every major New York publisher, except for one, Pantheon books. The imprint is part of the Random House empire overseen by Sonny Mehta, the great panjandrum of New York publishing, and it was O'Neill's good fortune that Mehta, a keen cricket fan, read the book and wrote a personal recommendation to booksellers.</p> <p>In any case, Netherland was greeted with extravagant praise by some of America's most influential critics. Writing in the New Yorker, James Wood called it 'one of the most remarkable post-colonial books I have ever read'. The New York Times hailed it as 'the wittiest, angriest, most exacting and most desolate work of fiction we've yet had about life in New York and London after the World Trade Center fell.'</p> <p>These were the kind of notices authors spend their bathtimes fantasising about. In Britain, critical acclaim tends to have a limited impact on sales, unless it comes from Richard and Judy. But in America, when Michiko Kakutani, of the New York Times, and James Wood rave about a book, it often provides a helpful nudge towards the bestseller list. 'I knew that I was at the tipping point,' O'Neill says. 'I knew that strangers would buy my book. That for me was a huge breakthrough. Members of your extended family are not the only ones who will read it.'</p> <p>In many respects, Netherland is an unlikely hit. First of all, any novel that describes the beauty of the square cut and cover drive does not scream out 'read me' to an American audience. As one of the characters says in the novel, 'There's a limit to what Americans understand. The limit is cricket.' Then there is the plot, which centres around a Dutch banker named Hans, his abandonment by his English wife Rachel, and his friendship with a shady Trinidadian entrepreneur called Chuck Ramkissoon. Nothing much happens in the story. The big event - Chuck's death, or rather, murder - takes place at the beginning, and thereafter the narrative meanders through Hans's troubled thoughts and his outsider's descriptions of New York.</p> <p>Yet it is a thoroughly absorbing book, not least because it grapples with the dislocated reality of 21st-century urban life, steeped in comfort and beset by fear, in which the internationally wealthy remain largely ignorant of, or indifferent to, the immigrant poor. As Hans ventures into Chuck's netherworld in the outer boroughs of New York, and learns of his scheme to introduce professional cricket to America, the Dutchman begins to see people and situations about which he previously knew nothing. Inevitably, Hans's attempt to grasp common bonds amid his emotional desolation is resonant of the wider search for community and identity that marked the anxious aftermath of the attacks on the World Trade Center. Hence, on top of its literary merits, the novel has been lauded for capturing the temper of the post-9/11 times. O'Neill acknowledges that his book arrived at just the right moment. 'It may be in tune with the zeitgeist,' he says. 'But you don't know that seven years before. One year earlier or later? If this book comes out after Obama, probably nobody cares.'</p> <p>O'Neill always wanted to be a writer. Such was his love of books that he decided not to read English at university, because literature was 'too precious to study - you want it to remain a hobby'. By the same token, he became a barrister, though not before taking a year off to write his first novel, This is the Life, about the travails of a young lawyer. 'Novel-writing is a bit like deception,' O'Neill has said. 'You lie as little as you possibly can. That's the way I do it, anyway.'</p> <p>In Netherland, Hans and his wife move into the Chelsea Hotel, the legendary bohemian refuge on West 23rd street, when they have to evacuate their Tribeca apartment after 9/11. With its cramped space and community of exiles and eccentrics, the hotel acts as a kind of idealised microcosm of Manhattan, an island unto itself. In reality, O'Neill also lives in the hotel with his wife, Sally Singer, a talented writer who is a senior editor at American Vogue, and their three young boys. The lobby, hall and staircase of the Chelsea is decorated with work by artists who live, or have lived, in the hotel. On the door of O'Neill's three-bedroom suite is an Obama sticker. Inside on the wall is a silkscreen multiple image of Sid Vicious, a former resident of the hotel who killed his girlfriend Nancy Spungen in a room downstairs.</p> <p>O'Neill met Singer back in 1991 when she was his American editor at Farrar, Straus and Giroux. She turned down his second novel, though that did not prevent them from setting up home in Soho in London. Singer worked for the London Review of Books and then British Vogue, but she was tempted back to the States in 1998 by an offer from American Elle. In Manhattan's heated medialand she is a name to be reckoned with. It can't have been easy, being her seemingly non-productive other half.</p> <p>'Joe was never really interested in any of that stuff,' says Singer, a sharp-looking woman whose fascination with fashion in no way disguises her formidable intellect. 'He never wanted to go to book parties. In fact, he much preferred to hang out with his cricket friends.'</p> <p>Even so, O'Neill discovered that people in New York were more interested in his work than they had been in London. 'I thought it was normal if you're a writer to get absolutely zero encouragement from anyone you met. I thought it was normal for even your friends to express no real interest in what you were doing and to take the piss as and when the opportunity arose. Here, much to my amazement, people would say, \"Oh you're a writer, you must meet so and so. Come round for dinner.\" Whereas if you meet someone in London, and you say come round for dinner, they think you're weird. \"Don't you have friends of your own?\" \"Who's this loser who wants us to come round for dinner? Why can't he have dinner with his own pals, like everyone else?\"'</p> <p>Notwithstanding the dinner invitations, he was initially homesick for London, his friends and family. He had enjoyed being a barrister and drew a great deal of professional satisfaction from the job. Although he continued to work for a year or so on 'run-off' cases, a crunch point was waiting for him. Originally, O'Neill and Singer had planned to stay for two years and then return to London. But as that deadline loomed, he was faced with the choice of going back to the law or becoming a full-time writer. If he returned to the bar, he felt that he would have to give up writing because, as a parent, he wouldn't have time for the law, his kids and literature, too.</p> <p>'It was really hard. Everyone I spoke to said, \"That's a tough decision.\" Then my wife said: \"Why don't you go and see the shrink,\" who's an expert on the question of the crossroads. So I went to see this guy, who knows all about life's forks, and I said, \"I have this really difficult problem. On the one hand, there's the bar, years of experience, my income and my family, maybe I should support my family. Then there's the writing...\"</p> <p>'He said, \"Yes I see that is a difficult problem. Tell me, what do you want to do?\"</p> <p>'I said, \"Well, of course I want to be a writer.\" And he said: \"Well, there you are.\"</p> <p>'Nobody had authorised me, because I was, and I am, a sort of conventional soul. I felt it was self-indulgent, but as he well understood - it was a one-session problem - the price you pay for not doing what you want to do is incalculable.'</p> <p>The resolution of one problem, however, opened up another: the business of writing a novel. O'Neill's first two novels, This is the Life and The Breezes, were suffused with intelligence and good writing, but essentially comic in tone and limited in scope. He knew it was time to stretch himself.</p> <p>'My ambition right at the beginning was to write the kind of book that I like to read, which is a \"voice\". You don't really care what the preoccupations are, you just want to be with this voice. I remember talking to my friend Albert Weinstein [a fellow Chelsea Hotel inhabitant], who's now dead, and he said that's a really hard thing to write.'</p> <p>James Wood suggested O'Neill should have cried 'Eureka!' when he had the idea of writing about cricket. 'It didn't seem like that,' the Irishman recalls. 'I had no other ideas. It's not like I had War and Peace up my sleeve. I just had another tacky novel about blokes as my fallback novel, and no one would actually want to read or buy that. And there was no point in delivering a novel preparatory to something else. So I went for broke, and that's in fact the only way to write.'</p> <p>After five years, though, it was the author who was broke, not financially so much as creatively. In a log cabin in the wilds of Canada, where he had gone to focus on writing, he realised he couldn't write the book he wanted to write. He phoned Singer and told her that he was giving up.</p> <p>'I was stuck in Canada and my plane ticket didn't take me back for another couple of days, so I read for a day and I read a book that really helped me called Housekeeping, by Marilynne Robinson. She is the sort of person who spends 20 years writing a novel. It was so slow. Nothing really happened and it was so attentive just to sentences. And I suddenly thought, why don't I write exactly what I want to write and to hell with the plot points.'</p> <p>He junked the second half of the book and started again from scratch. The result is a gorgeous, ruminative prose in which every sentence feels written, not typed. Comparisons have been made to F Scott Fitzgerald's masterpiece The Great Gatsby, and the poignant echo of that book can be clearly heard in a number of passages. The elegy is not commonplace in the modern English novel. There are examples, like Alan Hollinghurst's exquisite The Line of Beauty, which is also reminiscent of Gatsby, but on the whole it's an American form, inextricably tied to what Mehta, in relation to Netherland, called 'the compromised beauty of the American dream'.</p> <p>'I think Gatsby's mourning something much broader than the American dream,' says O'Neill. 'That last sentence [\"So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past\"], he's thinking more about the tragedy of time.'</p> <p>By contrast, it could be said that in Netherland the tragedy is more concerned with space, or dislocation. Time washes back and forth like the tide, but the real struggle is for a sense of place. Chuck's dream is to build a cricket ground where no one wants it. Hans's cricket team have to fight for their small slice of park land against competing and more popular sports. Hidden in the suburbs are the forgotten foundations of New York's history. Hans spends his sleepless nights looking at Google Earth images of the house in London to which his wife and son have moved. He lives in the suspended reality of the Chelsea Hotel, a kind of urban Neverland. And Ground Zero is the empty hole that fills the city's nightmares.</p> <p>Netherland: rarely has a one-word title worked on so many levels. Indeed it's so perfect that I wondered if he had it right from the start or whether he had a 'Trimalchio moment' - Fitzgerald at one time had planned to call The Great Gatsby Trimalchio in West Egg.</p> <p>'I certainly did have a Trimalchio moment,' O'Neill confesses. 'For years the book was called The Brooklyn Dream Game, till my friend, the poet Paul Muldoon, raised a friendly eyebrow... and I thought I had a terrific title. Netherland was suggested by Sally.'</p> <p><strong>As a teenager, O'Neill played cricket for the Netherlands' </strong>under-19 side. He kept up the sport in England and, when he came to New York, he set about looking for a game. Eventually he called up the Staten Island cricket club. 'Joe,' asked the club official, 'are you a white man?' 'Yes,' O'Neill replied. 'Well,' said the official, 'you better pack a helmet.'</p> <p>As with Hans, O'Neill's teammates were largely Asian and West Indian. Though it was a 'recreational decision' to take up cricket, he soon realised that he'd stumbled across a promising milieu for a novel. 'But I knew that I would have to spend another year or two penetrating the closed world of New York cricket.'</p> <p>Did he think he'd also located a suitable fictional arena in which to investigate the 'post-colonial' tensions to which Wood had referred?</p> <p>'I think you sense the metaphorical resonance of what you're writing without analysing it too carefully,' says O'Neill. 'That leads you down dead ends. You stop imagining things and start writing towards these themes. I think if you're writing about cricket you're obviously writing about power, because cricket is such a loaded sport, much more so than soccer. And in this country it's a sport of powerlessness.'</p> <p>One of O'Neill's fellow cricketers at the Staten Island cricket club is Habib Rehman, a 43-year-old taxi driver originally from Pakistan. 'He's my brother,' Habib told me outside the Chelsea Hotel. 'I call myself half-Irish and he calls himself half-Pakistani.' Habib hadn't read Netherland. He said he was waiting for an Urdu translation.</p> <p>Habib took us out to Brooklyn in his cab to see some of the places O'Neill describes in his book. It was a Friday and he had come straight from the mosque. 'I love Brooklyn,' he told me. He reeled off the street names and districts as if they were magical legends - Flatbush, Prospect Park, Brooklyn Heights - and sung the praises of the rich mix of people on the streets. 'Here,' he said, pointing out one parade of shops, 'they're West Indian. Those women,' he said of an approaching group of hijabis, 'they're Punjabi, like me. And those there,' gesturing towards some women in brightly coloured saris, 'they're from Bangladesh.'</p> <p>He took obvious pride in the multicultural make-up of his adopted home in a way, it struck me, that is unusual in Britain. In one sense, he occupied the margins of American life, working the nightshift in a taxi, playing cricket beyond the boundaries of fashionable Manhattan, and yet he seemed enthusiastic about his life prospects. Chuck Ramkissoon, too, is a man who knows that he is estranged from conventional American success and yet he retains an engaging, if perhaps misplaced, optimism about the way forward.</p> <p>O'Neill showed me a large wooden house in the classic American suburban mould in one of the more leafy districts of Brooklyn. It was an attractive home, full of space and light and horse chestnut trees. O'Neill and his family had lived here for a while during a hiatus away from the Chelsea Hotel. But they sold up and moved back to the hotel because Singer felt cut off from the action of Manhattan.</p> <p>Perhaps it's too melodramatic to call a change of neighbourhood a crisis of identity, but if Netherland has a point it's that our surroundings shape who we are and how we feel. And the more detached we are from our environment, the more disengaged we become from ourselves. For Hans, this realisation hits home during a bizarre date with a bewitching young woman who wants to be thrashed. He glimpses a reflection of himself wielding his belt and suddenly he feels a sadness 'produced when the mirroring world no longer offers a surface in which one may recognise one's true likeness'.</p> <p>Later, he's taken to the graveyard of the 18th-century Dutch reform church in Brooklyn. Chuck expects Hans to experience some kind of tribal connection among his dead countrymen. But he feels nothing. Looking at the headstones, with names like Jansen, van Dam and de Jong, Hans asks: 'What was one supposed to do with this information?'</p> <p>It's an interesting question because O'Neill knows how ghosts from the past can weigh on the living. In Blood-Dark Track, the memoir he published shortly before 9/11, he tells the story of his Turkish grandfather who was imprisoned by the British during the Second World War, and that of his Irish grandfather who was jailed at the same time for being a member of the IRA. Among other things, it's a fascinating exploration of familial and national identity. Towards the end of the book, during an argument with his Republican uncle, O'Neill becomes 'furious' that his patriotism and Irish nationality is brought into question.</p> <p>Nowadays, he seems to have come to terms with his rootless status. Indeed, he recognises its advantages. 'You don't have a functioning substantial identity as a writer,' he says, as we follow in Hans's footsteps in the graveyard of the Dutch church. 'You have a notional identity... I used to be quite exercised by nationality, but really I was an early member of the global flotsam. And if you stop thinking in terms of countries, you're left with cities.'</p> <p>If he thinks of another city, it is London, which he describes as a 'fantastic place'. But he also harbours reservations about the narrowness of vision it can impose. Netherland makes a number of references to the temporal currents that Fitzgerald writes of in Gatsby, so it is surely worth noting when Hans observes: 'Londoners remain in the business of rowing their boats gently down the stream.'</p> <p>'It's a nihilistic thing,' says O'Neill, when I ask about this sentence. 'It's about shrinking the significance of their achievements. People find satisfaction in shrinking their lives. It's an English recipe for living. Whereas here [in New York] there is in the air an almost inexhaustible sense of possibility.'</p> <p>Perhaps it says something about the endlessly expanding nature of American horizons that just recently O'Neill has begun to think Chuck's doomed scheme to popularise cricket in the States, which represents futility in the novel, may yet come to fruition in the real world. 'I mean,' says O'Neill, 'it would surprise me still, but it's now within the bounds of imagination.'</p> <p>Americans falling for cricket? That sounds a little far-fetched to my ears. Almost as incredible, in fact, as a novel about cricket becoming an American bestseller.</p>",
  "<p>It is foodie heaven this weekend as the organic beano gets under way in Bristol, but the theme of the first cookery demonstration is telling: 'seasonal cooking on a shoestring.'</p> <p>The annual Soil Association event comes at a tense time for producers, who are holding their breath after industry data showed hard-up consumers are deserting the cause.</p> <p>'There is evidence of quite a severe slowdown in the short term. The question on everybody's lips is: is this a blip or a new trend?' says Chris Longbottom, director at research firm TNS. The organic food market as a whole grew nearly 10 per cent in the year to August, but TNS says monthly growth rates have slowed dramatically since Easter.</p> <p>'Organics is going through a difficult time but sales are going down across the board and you wouldn't expect our market to be immune,' says former publisher Peter Kindersley, who has invested heavily in organics since selling his stake in Dorling Kindersley. 'People are having to make tough choices. At times like this the light greens tend to trade down but the whole agenda behind natural systems and farming will not go away.'</p> <p>Analysts say customers are seeking out discount stores such as Aldi and Lidl to balance greater demands on their income from higher mortgage, fuel and food bills. Last week the BRC shop price index showed food prices were 10 per cent higher than a year ago.</p> <p>'Sales are plateauing,' says Ian Price, of Triodos Bank, which oversees more than 100 organic farms. 'For most of my clients, demand has levelled off and they are left with a hard core of regulars.' The organic farms operate box schemes or sell at markets, channels that account for about 25 per cent of the \u00a31.1bn sector. The remainder is sold through the big four supermarkets. However, Price remains optimistic: 'There has been a sea-change in the last few years and organic is now part of the consumer psyche. As a bank we have confidence the market is there and supportable.' </p> <p>The flight to value - and away from the perceived quality end of the spectrum - is borne out by the experience of American specialist Whole Foods Market, which after years of success has seen sales and its share price fall sharply as customers defect to cheaper stores. The retailer has curtailed domestic expansion and is trying to shed its reputation for being expensive - it is nicknamed Whole Paycheck in the US - by running store tours to highlight budget lines. In the UK, it is heavily loss-making. </p> <p>According to TNS sales data, sales of organic fruit and vegetables increased just 2 per cent in the year to August - a dramatic slowdown from the double-digit increases previously enjoyed. Sales of organic eggs have declined every month this year and now account for 4.7 per cent of the market, against 7.4 per cent at its peak.</p> <p>'The decline in organic sales since Easter seems to fit in with other trends related to the credit crunch,' says Longbottom. 'People are examining their priorities and deciding where they want to indulge. The trend in eggs is interesting - free range is around 60 per cent of the market - so people are saying they are not happy with battery hens - but organic is a step too far.'</p> <p>Experts caution about drawing too much from current market trends given the poor summer, rising farm costs, and the blizzard of competing promotions being run in supermarkets. 'It feels like the market is in limbo,' says Helen Browning, director of food and farming at the Soil Association. 'Until now the market has been ticking along quite nicely. We need to see how things pan out between now and Christmas.'</p> <p>Browning, who runs an organic farm in Wiltshire supplying bacon and sausages to the likes of Tesco and Sainsbury's, says demand from retailers is a 'bit flat. Because of all the promotional activity we are finding sales are very erratic.'</p> <p>In the US, commentators speculate that about 15 per cent of the population are hardcore organic consumers. However, in the UK, TNS judges that organic food sales stand at 1-2 per cent of a \u00a3120bn market. </p> <p>Abel &amp; Cole director Ella Heeks is confident the organic market will continue to grow: 'A broad section of the population are interested and it's a decision based on values rather than income.' Heeks is also vice-chair of the Organic Trade Board, which has set a target to increase the market to \u00a34bn over the next five years as it expands into clothing and health and beauty products.</p> <p>Despite the premium attached to organic food, Heeks says buying a vegetable box is cost-effective as the price doesn't vary- Abel &amp; Cole has increased prices once in the last year. 'The number of people signing up is higher than this time last year, and we are seeing basket sizes increase as people shop across more categories. In many ways organics is in its infancy, there are so many talented and ambitious entrepreneurs in the sector with big plans.'</p> <p>Organic sales have stalled in previous downturns - but also enjoyed periods when sales have jumped 25-30 per cent. 'People are more and more concerned about the food chain and the countryside,' says Browning. 'Organics is part of the solution. To me it is about pioneering and championing new, more sustainable approaches to growing food. As long as that happens it doesn't matter what size the market is.'</p> <p>'I don't think this is the end of organics,' adds Kindersley. 'In times like this the light greens are going to equivocate, but they will come back when things get better.'</p> <h2>Kindersley's nest egg</h2> <p>What colour is your parachute? Peter Kindersley's is dark, dark green. The entrepreneur behind publisher Dorling Kindersley [DK] is one of the dons in the well-heeled organic mafia that includes Zac Goldsmith and Lady Bamford. Kindersley has redirected his passion for publishing into green ventures that include Sheepdrove Organic Farm in Berkshire and Neal's Yard. With its chickens, sheep and alpacas, Sheepdrove is a textbook organic farm.</p> <p>'We invite people here and hope they go away thinking natural systems do work,' he says. 'We see ourselves as enablers.' The 2,250-acre farm, nestled in the Berkshire downs, boasts an eco-complex-cum-conference centre with a turret that incorporates a 'blue-sky' room where delegates lie on bean bags; recent guests include Vodafone.</p> <p>Kindersley heads a clan of organic foodies that includes wife Juliet and children Barnabus and Rose, who is married to the chef Eric Treuille. Family interests include a biodynamic vineyard in France, an olive grove in Ibiza and soon-to-be-organic orchard in Herefordshire. The couple drive to Ibiza each year to collect oranges to make their favourite marmalade, and the organic cause runs deep. 'We are dark greens,' he says. 'Organic is not just about being chemical-free. There is also a social and environmental dimension.'</p> <p>Kindersley pocketed \u00a3100m from the sale of DK to Pearson in 2000. After the deal he shed his suit, preferring the tag environmentalist: 'I like the business of environmentalism. It's a way of getting out there and investing in things that are ethically sustainable.'</p> <p>Now 67, semi-retirement has given him time for his own thinking and at times it can be hard to follow him as he skips from organic farming to Bishop Desmond Tutu. He espouses agriculture rather than 'agribusiness' and is concerned about emergent monopolies, singling out giant producers such as Cargill and supermarkets as a matter of concern. He argues that large companies should be broken up, though he hasn't decided what is the tipping point. 'I'm opposed to anything that gets so large that the human scale is lost. We want more local and small-scale production.'</p> <p>Pursuing a green investment agenda has not made the family any poorer. While Kindersley won't say if the \u00a34m-turnover Sheepdrove is profitable, he says the family has done 'very well' by investing in its beliefs. 'The world is on our side,' he adds.</p>",
  "<h2>Brown tunes in</h2> <p>James Brown, founding editor of Loaded, is about to transfer his brand of laddish humour to a new medium. Currently advising the Daily Sport on its relaunch, Brown, pictured, is in talks with Radio Six, perhaps the coolest BBC music station, about hosting a new show. Industry sources say Lesley Douglas, the executive in charge of the corporation's music output, has 'okayed' the idea. </p> <h2>Beeb hot seats </h2> <p>Douglas may soon be on the move herself. She is being touted as the new controller of BBC4, the Beeb's highbrow digital TV channel. George Entwistle has been keeping the 4 hot seat warm while its current controller, Janice Hadlow, takes a sabbatical to write a book. But Hadlow is strongly tipped to replace BBC2 controller Roly Keating when he moves upstairs to take charge of the corporation's archive content. Douglas's move would create a vacancy for one of the most powerful jobs in radio. You heard it here first. </p> <h2>Race for the post </h2> <p>Hadlow may not have the BBC2 job in the bag just yet, however. Hamish Mykura, head of documentaries at Channel 4, has emerged as an outside candidate for the post, according to industry sources. He was behind Diana: The Witnesses in the Tunnel, 4's controversial one-off about the death of Princess Diana. </p> <h2>Glimpse of power</h2> <p>Dan Sabbagh, the Times's highly-rated media editor, came close to swapping Fleet Street for Downing Street over the summer, according to Whitehall sources. Sabbagh was approached by Stephen Carter, who wanted him to join the Number 10 press team, and was then sounded out about a separate job - head of press at the Labour party. But with Carter's influence on the wane, it looks as if Sabbagh will be staying put. </p> <h2>Mail's intended </h2> <p>Much jubilation - and not a little amusement - over at the Daily Mail, where joint deputy editor Jon Steafel has revealed that he's finally tied the knot. Steafel is the nearest thing that the Mail has to a Bohemian, having stayed with his partner, Penny, for more than 20 years without getting married. However, he returned from his summer holiday and announced that the two had wed. Mischievous Mail insiders point out that Steafel is a leading contender to succeed Paul Dacre as editor when the great man finally retires - and becoming a married man is unlikely to damage his chances.</p> <h2>Quality street</h2> <p>Claire Oldfield, a former Daily Mail hack and executive at London freesheet City AM, landed a top job last year as deputy global editor-in-chief at Metro International, helping to oversee content across the group's 80 or more free titles. But she has now left the group, telling executives that she wants to return to 'a quality UK paper'. Ouch! </p> <h2>Will the real Capello...?</h2> <p>Cock-up of the month comes from the Evening Standard's 'Homes and Property' supplement, which ran a correction that deserves to be republished in full. 'My story last week about Fabio Capello,' confessed Standard hack Compton Miller, 'was illustrated with a picture, not of the new England manager but of Irish builder Michael McElinney, a professional Capello lookalike.' Miller adds: 'Apologies to Mr Capello, and congratulations to Mr McElinney - a remarkably small number of readers spotted the difference.'</p>",
  "<p>In 1995, a shares trading platform called Tradepoint launched in London with the aim of taking business away from the London Stock Exchange, which was viewed as a cumbersome monopoly charging exorbitant fees to its customers. Critics said its days were numbered.</p> <p>But 13 years on, it is clear that Tradepoint was never the threat that some had predicted: it failed to land a client base big enough to challenge the LSE. Despite suggestions that the London exchange faced the prospect of being consigned to the history books, it remains a force in the land with burgeoning revenue and volumes driven by a new generation of traders who work for the $5 trillion hedge-fund industry. But for how long can the LSE hang on?</p> <p>Today, it faces an even greater threat to its position as new trading platforms challenge it on a number of different fronts, making the threat of a lone operator such as Tradepoint look tame by comparison. Project Turquoise, backed by nine investment banks, has already launched; as has Chi-X, controlled by electronic broker Instinet; America's Nasdaq OMX goes live in the UK on 26 September; Bats Trading, supported by Credit Suisse and Lehman Brothers, is understood to be readying for a launch in November. Others, promising fast services over the internet, are in the process of seeking financial backing from wealthy City individuals.</p> <p>More efficient technology means that new operators can offer cheaper and faster services, while cutting costs for customers. 'The cosy monopoly of the established exchanges is coming to an end,' said one analyst. 'They will have to cut their own bloated cost base or die.'</p> <p>Investors fear that the new competition will eat into the LSE's margins - as a consequence, its share price has taken a hammering, falling by more than half in 18 months. Daniel Garrod, an analyst at Citigroup says: 'The possible impact on LSE trading volumes and necessary pricing response is the most crucial issue impacting the shares..'</p> <p>A few blocks away from LSE's headquarters in London's Paternoster Square, Charlotte Crosswell, president of Nasdaq OMX Europe, thumbs her way through a presentation that illustrates 'the competitive service' they'll be offering 'potential customers once we are up and running'. But the explosive information at her fingertips is the damage inflicted on the New York Stock Exchange by competitors over recent years who have cut NYSE's market share in equities trading from around 90 per cent to 40 per cent. 'What we and others are doing is opening up the market, going after (the incumbent's) business and chasing new business.' Her advisers say Nasdaq's objective is to 'undercut' the LSE and offer a 'one-stop shop' that will give customers the opportunity to buy or sell shares in up to 900 leading European stocks, clinching deals not in minutes but in nanoseconds.</p> <p>Clara Furse's LSE, however, exudes quiet confidence in the face of the oncoming onslaught. Spokesman Patrick Humphris says London cut a wide range of tariffs in recognition of the new trading landscape this week. He adds: 'None of this [the competition] is being sprung on us. We have known about it for some time and have taken counter-measures, reducing prices and improving our technology, which is second to none.'</p> <p>Another important point is that the LSE's listings business, which accounts for about 20 per cent of its revenues, will not be affected by the new entrants, who are confining themselves to shares trading. Foreign and domestic companies seeking to list in London will still need to obtain LSE accreditation, so one leg of the exchange's old monopoly remains intact. The LSE is also in the enviable position of having diversified its income stream in the last seven years, with 26 per cent of group revenue derived from real-time information and data linked to company trading and share price movements. The LSE's Alternative Investment Market is another successful leg of its business. Andrew Hilton, head of the Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation, has been following the way exchanges operate for the last 20 years. He says: 'Frankly, if you asked me to provide a compelling intellectual argument why the established exchanges should stay in business, I would struggle to provide one. They tend to be big, high-overhead bodies that are not particularly competitive on price, nor do they provide cutting-edge technology. Others can do it for less money and more efficiently. It is not rocket science - setting up a trading platform is not particularly expensive or complex.'</p> <p>So how does the LSE survive? According to Hilton and many analysts, the explanation is down to brand loyalty and prestige. The LSE, they argue, is as much a part of the City as the Bank of England. But it is even more than that, symbolising the high-octane, financial powerhouse that makes London a global commercial centre of the first order. To break that vice-like grip on the public imagination will be far from easy.</p>",
  "<p>A snail could crawl along the Great Wall of China in about the same time it will take for women to have equal representation as men in Parliament at the current rate of progress, according to the latest Sex and Power survey from the Equality and Human Rights Commission. Other areas are slightly more egalitarian: the snail would only have to go from Land's End to John o'Groats and halfway back to find women equally represented among FTSE 100 companies. </p> <p>But one industry appears to be bucking the trend: fund management. In the past few months, Katherine Garrett-Cox has been appointed chief executive of Dundee-based Alliance Trust while Ruth Keattch is joining investment boutique Artemis as a fund manager in its small and mid-cap team. They join a growing band of women in senior positions in the industry.</p> <p>Nicola Horlick, founder of Bramdean Asset Management, is perhaps the most high profile, but others include Helena Morrissey, chief executive of Newton Investment Management; Jane Platt, chief executive of National Savings and Investments; Sarah Arkle, chief investment officer at Threadneedle; Anne Richards, who holds the same position at Aberdeen Asset Management; Karen Prooth, who heads the European ishares business at Barclays Global Investors; Nichola Pease, chief executive of JO Hambro Capital Management... the list goes on.</p> <p>'It's very easy to measure how good a fund manager is,' says Arkle. 'We all live and breath by the performance tables so it is possibly easier to be completely unbiased [about gender] as you are being measured every minute of your life.'</p> <p>It is also a more predictable life: while investment bankers, lawyers or accountants may end up having to work through the night when a big assignment arrives, fund management is rarely that demanding. Harriett Baldwin, who has just retired after 23 years working for JP Morgan Asset Management, says: 'When my son was very young, I could say, \"I know I need to be in California for a board meeting on that date\", and have it scheduled in advance. That is not the case in investment banking, where you are not able to plan ahead.'</p> <p>While keeping up with the research and reports is time-consuming, it can be done at home: many male fund managers admit to scouring the FT after putting the children to bed. 'The BlackBerry has revolutionised things,' says Baldwin. But she thinks the number of women in the industry is still 'woefully low', something she was trying to address while at JP Morgan by hosting events at universities and sixth-form colleges, promoting it as a family-friendly career, as well as by running women's support networks and mentoring systems to encourage those already in the firm. There was some success: recruitment at graduate level was evenly split between men and women, despite the fact that fewer than 30 per cent of applicants were female.</p> <p>There are many talented female fund managers commanding good places in the performance league tables, such as Rosemary Banyard at Schroders, Elena Shaftan at Jupiter, Karen Robertson at Standard Life and Fatima Luis at F&amp;C. But, as in other professions, women are in the minority. While there are no formal statistics about the split between male and female fund managers, a survey by Citywire showed that just 10 per cent of those it rates are women. </p> <p>But there is some evidence that things are improving. Michele Turner, who specialises in fund management placements for executive search agency Hanson Green, says that five years ago just 7.5 per cent of the executives targeted as potential candidates were women; now the figure is 20 per cent while, among those actually placed, the rise is even steeper from 4 per cent in 2003 to 20 per cent over the past year.</p> <p>She thinks that could still understate the position as women executives can be more loyal to their existing employers, often because they have arrangements such as flexible or part-time working.</p> <p>If the lifestyle of some of the senior women is anything to go by, fund management is certainly more family friendly: indeed, a large brood almost looks like a qualification for a senior job. Morrissey leads the charge with eight children, but Horlick has five of her own - a sixth died of leukaemia - while her second husband has a further three; Garrett-Cox has four and Pease has three.</p> <p>Morrissey says that fund management can more easily be combined with having a family than some other careers. 'You are measured by performance rather than hours you spend at your desk. We encourage people - men and women - to work from home to give them flexibility and space.'</p> <p>But, as she would admit, good support systems are useful too: her husband stays at home to look after the children. Abderdeen's Richards, who has twins, says: 'You have to work hard to make it work if you have a family. You need a supportive partner, whether you are a man or a woman.' Her husband works from home, making it easier to co-ordinate diaries for business trips. But she adds: 'I have a number of good friends in the City who are single or childless. I would not say they have done better or worse than those who have children.'</p> <p>She thinks that encouraging women makes good business sense: while two decades ago, they would invariably have given up when they had children, now many of Aberdeen's female managers come back part-time. 'Once their children get older, we see them increase their hours to get closer to full-time. Some of them will stay until they are 60. If we can keep them, that is fantastic.'</p> <p>Arkle thinks that could be facilitated by the way fund management companies are structured. 'There is a very flat structure. Once you start in a fund management business, by and large you will be doing the same thing you were doing in your late twenties.' Success will bring more money in from investors and new funds to manage, increasing the challenges. 'You can have a really good name without ever having to leave or manage lots of people. So the glass ceiling is perhaps not as important.' </p> <p>The performance ethos can, however, also work against women. Horlick's career has included spells at Deutsche Bank and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and she says: 'When I ran big fund managers, I recruited an equal number of women and men, but most of the women went off to do other things.' She attributes that to the fact that 'a lot of women do not like to be constantly measured, they find it very stressful'.</p> <p>Morrissey says that will partly depend on the ethos of the firm: 'It is clearly very pressurised but we have a team approach, which is not quite so stressful. Women are generally quite conscientious and, if they have done all the hard work but get it wrong because of extraneous circumstances [like the movement of the market], it can be very frustrating.'</p> <p>A good fund management performance can be a step up to more general responsibilities, as the promotion to chief executive of Morrissey and Garrett-Cox has shown. </p> <p>Platt, who has that role in National Savings, says: 'In my time as a fund manager I spent a lot of time analysing companies, how they were doing and why some were doing well and some badly. I became mesmerised by the question of strategic management and direction which convinced me to leap across. But you have to convince someone you can make that leap across in practice.'</p> <p>One thing that frustrates all high-profile women is the amount of attention their gender brings. Garrett-Cox has earned the rather predictable sobriquet Katherine the Great, Horlick is known as Superwoman, while Carol Galley, one of the first top female fund managers when she was at Mercury Asset Management, was dubbed the Ice Maiden.</p> <p>Plenty of men in similar positions have comparable idiosyncrasies - New Star's John Duffield always eats in the same restaurant and wears the same Marks &amp; Spencer jumpers; Aberdeen's Martin Gilbert is usually glued to his BlackBerry - but they do not attract the same interest, nor do they have such patronising nicknames. </p> <p>Some now shun the limelight to avoid encouraging yet more clich\u00e9d coverage, but Morrissey says: 'I hate the superwoman tag but it does show people that it can be done if you want to do it. That is one of the advantages.'</p>",
  "<p>So you've seen Sideways, yes? The film featuring Miles and Jack ambling through mid-life crises and Californian vineyards \"in search of wine and in search of themselves\". And you might also remember The Darling Buds of May, in which strait-laced taxman Charley was lured into the bucolic postwar Kentish idyll of the Larkin family - and more particularly into the arms of the young Catherine Zeta-Jones - via a few bottles of local hooch. Great stories, set 6,000 miles and half a century apart, yet, in a manner of speaking, you can have a walk-on part in both just an hour's drive from London.</p> <p>Let's start in Larkin territory. Not far from Pluckley in Kent, where the TV series was filmed, is Biddenden. These vineyards were founded in 1969 when, in what might have been a Darling Buds plotline, the mother of current owner Julian Barnes (no, not that one) heard an item about wine on Woman's Hour and persuaded her husband to give over a few acres of their apple orchards to vine. Wine might have been produced in England since before the Norman conquest, but this was the ground floor of the modern English wine industry and Biddenden reflects where it came from and, just maybe, where it's heading.</p> <p>Biddenden still specialises in the ortega grape, which produces fruitily off-dry Germanic-style wine, which is presented in bottles with gothic script on the labels. The longstanding lack of interest from the wine trade in this style means that 80% of this wine is sold at the farm gate. But Biddenden is adapting to modern tastes. It has retained some orchard and produces increasingly sought-after apple juice as well as cider. The vineyards - quite spectacularly beautiful - attract 30,000 visitors a year, who can walk among the vines as well as taste the products at the farm shop. There is even a self-catering converted loft - complete with incongruously hi-tech flat screen TV - where guests can stay. But perhaps most interesting is that Biddenden has begun to introduce the more fashionable French variety grapes, and sparkling wine and light pinot noir are coming on stream. \"You work with what you've got,\" explains Barnes. \"But that doesn't mean you can't change things as you go along.\"</p> <p>If David Jason as Pop Larkin might have raised an eyebrow at the advances at Biddenden, he would have apoplexy at Chapel Down. This stock market listed company (<a href=\"http://www.englishwinesgroup.com\">englishwinesgroup.com</a>) sees itself very much as the future, and its approach has been more revolution than evolution. It has made a commitment to French varietal grapes - in particular the champagne holy trinity of pinot noir, chardonnay and pinot meunier - and has approached the problem of high prices and variable quality of English wines by going unashamedly upmarket. Chapel Down was the first English winemaker to win a gold medal at the International Wine Challenge, it supplies Gordon Ramsay and Gary Rhodes restaurants, the Dorchester and Mandarin Oriental hotels, and it exports. Just like the state-of-the-art California wineries visited by Miles and Jack in Sideways - and as is the norm in other wine tourist hotspots round the world - Chapel Down also boasts a newly opened high-quality restaurant.</p> <p>A visit can range from some fairly lavish all-day corporate entertainment to wandering round the vineyard and tasting the entire range of wines for free. There are plenty of other options in between - comparative tasting of identical wine aged in either French or American oak barrels is a particularly enlightening part of one tour - and this combination of high-quality product and visitor access appears to be the new model for the English wine industry. A few miles away at the Gusbourne Estate, one of the many new vineyards cropping up all over England and Wales, they have been planting vines since 2004, but won't have any wine (sparkling only, competing directly with some of the best-known Champagnes) until 2009. But already the vineyards are picture-book pretty, with a rose bush bookending every line of vines, and a visitor and tasting centre will be ready as soon as the wines are.</p> <p>Looking out over the Gusborne vines to the newly constructed windfarm dominating the skyline over Romney marsh, you might be reminded that everything changes. The Darling Buds of May landscape is now inhabited by Sideways viticulture and increasingly sophisticated wine culture. But in a sense, that's nothing new. An ice age or two ago, Kent and Champagne were part of the same landmass. And, as the winemakers enthusiastically point out, every one degree of global warming pushes the \"wine-growing envelope\" 200km north. So raise a glass of English sparkling now, and maybe prepare your grandchildren for the possibility of a glass of English claret.</p> <h2>Vineyards to visit</h2> <p><strong>Camel Valley</strong></p> <p>Bodmin, Cornwall</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.camelvalley.com\">camelvalley.com</a></p> <p>Makes sparkling wine using the traditional methode champenoise, and offers a range of tours: we like the sound of the grand tour and tasting.</p> <p><strong>Sharpham</strong></p> <p>Totnes, Devon</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.sharpham.com\">sharpham.com</a></p> <p>A vineyard and winery in a stunning location above the River Dart.

Sporting rain jackets and lycra shorts, we departed with grim determination for the first winery of our tour. With cycle touring now a popular pastime in the vineyards of Napa Valley, Australia and France, I decided it was time to try it here. </p> <p>The first stop, Bookers, is a small winery in Bolney. It wasn't a great start. I had called earlier in the week to arrange a tasting, but on arriving we found them busy with another group, leaving us to peer wistfully into the winemaking sheds, full of shiny vats. </p> <p>Spirits, and clothes, dampened, we set off for Ridgeview, a much larger concern producing a South Downs version of champagne. It also has a cellar, with its own lift, capable of holding 250,000 bottles. Our tasting, by contrast, was three thimble-sized nips of wine. A pint was in order, so the next stop was a pub near the foot of Ditchling Beacon, a favourite hill for cyclists to test their legs. </p> <p>Breaky Bottom, not far from Lewes, made all the hills worth it. Even the sun came out. Peter Hall, the winemaker there, served up a lip-puckeringly crisp 2003 Cuv\u00e9e Alex Mercier (named after Hall's French grandfather). </p> <p>Hall planted his vines in 1974 and has been battling away in the valley ever since, overcoming floods, hungry snails, cold summers and the realities of small-scale production in an industry that thrives on economies of scale and vertical integration. He joked that the lift to the cellar at Ridgeview cost as much as his entire operation. </p> <p>Freewheeling into Newhaven to catch the train back, we had covered around 30 miles, through rain, bumpy lanes and A-roads full of angry motorists, for five small tastes of wine - seeing the ferry about to depart for Dieppe, I couldn't help thinking it would be a bit easier in the sunny cyclist's paradise across the channel. But then again, where would be the challenge in that?</p>",

  "<p>It started with Darren Clarke and Ian Poulter. Then there was Graeme Hick, Dimitar Berbatov, Thaksin Shinawatra, the Abu Dhabi sheikhs, Robinho, Jimmy Bullard, Kevin Keegan, Alan Curbishley, and Andy Murray. Ins and outs were the theme of the week, in screaming headlines, and Murray was the only story relating directly to events on the field of play. </p> <p>Meanwhile, down on Brighton beach, Kim Smith and Phoebe Jeffery, along with eight other British Olympic hopefuls, served up another possible headline. This time they and their sport, unsurprisingly given all that was going on elsewhere, went unnoticed. The story? Precisely 12 days after the Beijing closing ceremony, Smith and Jeffery officially started the countdown to the next Olympiad by taking part in the first match in the first global event in any of the 26 Olympic sports. London 2012, here we come. </p> <p>You cannot play beach volleyball on Brighton's pebbles, so more than 1,100 tonnes of sand were shipped in for the five-day FIVB Junior World Championships, and a temporary stadium was constructed around the show court at the impressive, purpose-built Yellowave beach sports centre. Heavy rain and strong winds kept the spectators away - the forecast is better today - but the men's and women's matches went on regardless. </p> <p>It was a struggle for the 10 Brits, all novices who have been playing for months rather than years, and all of whom were eliminated before the knockout stages. When the Sheaf brothers, Luke and Jake, played a Czech pair on Friday in a downpour, the PA man shouted, 'Come on Brighton, let's make some noise for Britain.' It was a big ask, given 1,989 of the 2,000 seats were empty, and two of the 11 occupied were taken by Czechs. </p> <p>This is the first major beach volleyball event in Britain and for the Sheafs, from a sporting family of footballers, volleyball players and oarsmen, it was still a big moment. The team will disband soon when Luke, the elder of the two, switches sports and joins the GB rowing development squad. Jake, 18, is sticking to full-time volleyball at university in Bath and aims to compete at Horse Guards Parade, where the 2012 beach volleyball will be staged. Before that, there will be a world tour event in July in Jubilee Gardens, underneath the London Eye. </p> <p>The six-a-side indoor game and beach volleyball have recruited players from UK Sport's Talent ID network and via Sporting Giants, the scouting system that seeks out potential Olympians in handball, volleyball, and rowing. </p> <p>Britain has never had a team in the Olympics in indoor volleyball, and only once in the beach version, when Audrey Cooper and Amanda Glover finished ninth in Atlanta in 1996. </p> <p>With funding of \u00a31.3m from UK Sport, British volleyball is better placed than it has ever been. 'It's the first time we've had any funding, and we certainly have possibilities for 2012,' says Richard Callicott, president of British Volleyball and a former chief executive of UK Sport, in the Brighton grandstand. 'We're in the process of fixing targets for the next four years and some of the players here could compete in London or in 2016.' </p> <p>Another event in Blackpool is recruiting for the future. Hundreds of children were encouraged to try out the sport ahead of another big date for beach volleyball this coming weekend, the first European Tour event to be staged in Britain. . </p> <p>In a busy week for London-bound Olympians, the GB basketball team began their Euro League programme with matches in Israel and, last night, in London's 02 Arena against the Czech Republic. There was good news for the judo team, who did not win a medal in Beijing, when they secured a \u00a31m sponsorship deal from security firm G4. </p> <p>While politicians will be grilling Boris Johnson about the number of officials who went to Beijing at this week's mayoral question time, and arguing over expenses, the athletes are already thinking about the next Olympiad rather than the last one.</p>",
  "<p>The world's number one footballer, Kak\u00e1, will consider joining Manchester City next summer if the newly enriched club achieve their initial target of Champions League qualification.</p> <p>Since last Sunday, City have been under the control of the Abu Dhabi United Group (ADUG), a vehicle of a Middle East sovereign wealth fund whose representatives have promised to turn them into 'the biggest club in the world, bigger than both Real Madrid and Manchester United' by pursuing 'the biggest players in the world'.</p> <p>Kak\u00e1, Fifa's current World Player of the Year, has been seeking an exit from AC Milan and thought he would be allowed to leave for Chelsea during the summer. Milan ultimately decided against selling the 26-year-old Brazilian, but he believes the club will sanction a 100m euros transfer in a year's time. </p> <p>'Kak\u00e1 would prefer a club like Chelsea, Real Madrid or Milan, but we never know,' Kak\u00e1's representative Diogo Kotscho told The Observer. 'This season Manchester City do not have a team to win the Champions League. Maybe next season they can get into that competition - they have the prospects to be good enough. What they need to have is a big project to win the Premier League and the Champions League. It's not just about Kak\u00e1, they will only get the very best players if they attain this level. It was the same with Chelsea a few years ago - they had to prove themselves too.</p> <p>'I think Manchester City are headed in the right direction, but they have big work to do. It's no easy thing to reach the same level as the biggest clubs in the world, and it's not just about money - you have to spend it properly and build a great team. In two or three years they can be there if they do the right things.'</p> <p>In their first 24 hours as City's owners ADUG lodged British record bids of more than \u00a330m each for Tottenham's Dimitar Berbatov, Valencia's David Villa and Real Madrid's Robinho, forcing up Manchester United's expenditure on Berbatov and stealing Robinho from Chelsea's grasp. His acquisition was also intended to provide a star name with which to promote City in the Far East.</p> <p>ADUG's takeover is also understood to have caught club officials off guard. In the days preceding City's purchase, new chief executive Garry Cook had said that though the club were seeking investment, they were not for sale. Instead, Thaksin Shinawatra accepted an offer of around \u00a3200m for a club whose expenditure he could no longer afford to service. The final price will not be settled until ADUG complete due diligence on the club's books and the deal could fall through if significant problems are uncovered.</p> <p>Though Thaksin's price demands almost resulted in ADUG withdrawing from the purchase last Sunday, the former Thai prime minister could profit by as much as \u00a380m for his 14 months as owner. Thaksin has been allowed to retain a 10 per cent stake in the company and an honorary position on the board.</p> <p>ADUG forms part of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, a sovereign wealth fund managing an estimated $500bn worth of assets. Sheikh Mansour Bin Zayed Al Nahyan drove the move into Premier League football as a means of promoting the emirate abroad.</p> <p>The contractors on <strong>Liverpool's</strong> postponed new stadium project have denied they are considering legal action against the club. Liverpool announced an indefinite delay on construction of the \u00a3300m Anfield replacement last month, blaming 'global market conditions' yet promising to investigate increasing the stadium's capacity by 13,000 seats to 73,000.</p> <p>Liverpool have been able to begin only preliminary work on the site at Stanley Park, resulting in the European Union withdrawing grants to fund the regeneration of the surrounding area.</p> <p>Though not specifically asked about the possibility of suing Liverpool over the delays, a spokesperson for contractors Laing O'Rourke said: 'Laing O'Rourke continues to work closely with Liverpool FC in order to achieve their ambitions of constructing the new football stadium. Laing O'Rourke further wishes to clarify that it has not considered legal action against Liverpool FC.'</p> <p>Liverpool's American owners, Tom Hicks and George Gillett, face a January deadline for refinancing the \u00a3350m loan with which they have been running the club. A Dubai-based investment fund remain prepared to buy them out for around \u00a3500m, including that debt.</p>",
  "<p>If you walk the length of the diplodocus in Alfred Waterhouse's still extraordinary Victorian entrance hall to the Natural History Museum and then follow the curve of its tail you will soon be faced with a comparable surprise: the largest cocoon ever made by man. The cocoon, which has grown quietly in west London since it was first conceived in 2001, will be revealed at the beginning of 2009, in time for Darwin's 200th birthday - 60m long, and eight storeys high, bulging within a huge glass box.</p> <p>Last month I was standing in the shadow of the concrete cocoon with Anna Maria Indrio. Indrio, an Italian, is a partner in the Danish architectural practice CF M\u00f8ller, which has designed the new Darwin extension to the museum. She is herself a force of nature, full of proprietory excitement at her creation: 'Most of all we wanted,' she says, 'to create a skin, a shell for all this fantastic treasure!'</p> <p>The cocoon will house not one insect but 17m of them, all carefully filed and annotated (along with 3m flowering plant specimens) - but it is not just this unparalleled archive that will be stored together for the first time. In the heart of the new building the Natural History Museum will also be putting its greatest living wonders on show: its staff of 220 scientists will be presented in full view of the public.</p> <p>At intervals, along the winding descent through the dramatic cocoon, these rare creatures will be viewed behind glass at their work stations, preparing petri-dishes, peering through microscopes, eating lunch, perhaps grabbing an afternoon nap. At various points the public will have the opportunity to interact directly with them, to ask questions and to examine experiments. </p> <p>The museum believes this initiative will radically change the way it is perceived - that it will shift overnight in the popular imagination from being a home to fabulous old bones to being seen as a living and breathing organism. 'It has sometimes seemed an introverted space,' director of science Richard Lane tells me. 'Now the place will be an extrovert suddenly; there will be a new openness about what we do.'</p> <p>To get a sense of what this new openness might mean I sought out various curators in their corners of the current building, which has, over the last century, spawned its own intricate ecosystem. The scientists are squirrelled away, in Victorian rooms that smell sharply of naphthalene, behind vast oak doors. Labs and desks have grown among the crevices and nooks of 7.5km of mahogany drawers. The beetle men are separated from the botanists, and the botanists can be quietly sniffy about the flashy lepidopterists.</p> <p>Wandering the corridors of this place, within which the vast cocoon is taking shape, I occasionally catch the uncanny atmosphere of David Cronenburg's The Fly, or of Kafka's Metamorphosis. There is no building in London that makes you feel more a human animal than this one. I've always envied the neurologist Oliver Sacks's account of hiding in the Natural History Museum as a boy and spending the night among dinosaur bones: 'Even familiar animals became fearful, uncanny, as I prowled that night,' he recalled, 40 years later, 'their faces suddenly looming out of the darkness or hovering ghostlike at the periphery of the flashlight. The museum, lightless, was a place of delirium, and I was not wholly sorry when morning came ...'</p> <p>Though there is much that is dead in the museum, the scientists are what alchemise it into life. I come across Mark Spencer, curator of plants, floppy haired and T-shirted in the museum's inner sanctum, its holy of holies, the Sloane Herbarium, where all of this began. Hans Sloane, royal physician of the 17th century, bequeathed the first 5,000 specimens to the collection, which prompted Linnaeus to invent his classification system and, with it, botany. Spencer pulls down a leather-bound volume from the stacks around the walls and opens it at random. Pressed and labelled in a neat inked hand is a lilac specimen collected by the Reverend Adam Buddle, the original country pastor and amateur botanist, after whom Linnaeus named the butterfly bush (Buddleia).</p> <p>Spencer's eyes light up. 'We used to think,' he says, 'of British botany as something that was pretty much done and dusted, but now with climate change these books are becoming incredibly important. Among other things they offer an invaluable time series. You can mine them for flowering cycles, carbon content, density of stoma on leaves which changes according to the amount of CO2 in the air - all of that.'</p> <p>Like all the curators I meet, Spencer is clearly in the grip of something of a lifelong obsession. This is much more than a vocation. It was his 40th birthday recently, he explains, and his mum was recalling how she would lie him down on the grass as a baby and he would crawl over to the flower bed and pull off flower heads, start collecting and examining specimens. He has never stopped.</p> <p>He was a gardener at Kew, but after a PhD in fungal evolution he found himself here, in charge of 3m pressed flowers. He spent the first two years studying Linnaeus's seaweed names, finding arcane errors, putting them right. The history of nomenclature, which is one of the functions of this museum, has in part been a story of Chinese whispers, he suggests. It is expensive and embarrassing when you don't get it right. He points to a classic example recently of researchers who, having done an enormous amount of work with medicinal leeches, could not explain their weird data. It turned out, because of a spelling error, they had been using the wrong species for years.</p> <p>In order to keep the archive correct and alive Spencer relies in part on a quiet army of like-minded volunteers. The tradition of the amateur botanist, of Adam Buddle, is alive and well. 'David for example,' he gestures round the corner, where an elderly man is intent at a microscope 'is an expert on hawkweeds and he looks after those for me. There are dozens of people like him.' But still, the collection is not as open as Spencer would like it to be. 'The aim is always if a member of public says, \"I want to look at the plants in my area,\" within reason we will allow that.'</p> <p>The new Darwin cocoon will allow this interaction to go much further. In the coming years Spencer believes we will need to be ever more vigilant about the ways in which our plant life is changing and the museum hopes to enlist the public in its data collection efforts. The current bluebell project - an attempt to discover the extent of the spread of the invasive Spanish variety and the threat to our native flower - run by Spencer, is a case in point. 'Scientists can't collect all the data, but we now have thousands of people helping - and children can learn basic science by getting involved.' Bumble-bee and earthworm projects will follow.</p> <p>This public involvement might prove invaluable in the arguments about climate change, Spencer thinks. 'When the systems really start breaking down, Dutch elm disease-type events will be happening all around. In the last five years there have been profound shifts in the London area, for example. Tree of heaven would never self-set in London. It is increasingly a huge problem now because it is growing everywhere. We have avocado flowering and fruiting. Bougainvillea overwintering on King's Cross Road.'</p> <p>Life thrives on perturbation but the chaos we are going to put ourselves through in the next 50 years will be too much for many native species, Spencer believes. For the time being, though, he has more than enough to keep him happy. Does he have a favourite plant? 'The Lizard peninsula is full of amazing things,' he says. 'There's a little squitty thing called fringed rupture wort which is just like a little green mat on a rock, but it's an endlessly fascinating thing to me. A lot of science is people looking at a plant or whatever and thinking: how on earth does it do that? It is like art: why is something wondrous to people?'</p> <p>This question seems particularly challenging later that afternoon when I meet Dr Martin Hall, who has some of the more extreme insights into all creatures great and small at the museum. Hall is the country's leading forensic scientist, his speciality being the study of maggots in flesh wounds to discover the precise time of a murder.</p> <p>He is a wry and engaging figure, a man who should be a TV drama series. He greets me with a selection of fattened maggots in pots, a kind of juju necklace of maggots removed from the rear end of a sheep, and a series of graphic photographs of wounds (mostly in live animals) in which maggots are making hay. In among the photographs are a couple of pictures of his own legs and arms with livid sores.</p> <p>'I had a personal experience of some of this after I came back from Bolivia one time,' he explains matter of factly, 'along with the maggot of a botfly in my leg. They can eventually get quite large,' - he opens a 2in gap between thumb and forefinger - 'so I could feel this movement and I could see the tip of the maggot coming up to breathe and going back down.'</p> <p>What did he do?</p> <p>'Well you can't really squeeze them out, because they have these backward facing spines. You need surgery. I had a couple in my arm, too. I discovered if you put Vaseline over them they can't breathe and tend to back out of their own accord, eventually.'</p> <p>One of the numerous practical applications of the entomology department - I also come across several scientists devoted to the eradication of the kind of crop pests that can wreck national economies or experts in mosquito behaviour who are helping fight endemic disease - is in criminology. The museum has led the way in this field for the past 25 years. Hall's predecessor wrote the seminal book on the subject. 'Our involvement is three pronged,' Hall says, 'we do research, training and casework.'</p> <p>The casework involves attending the crime scene of around 20 murders a year, some of them extremely high profile. Pathologists are not precise in estimating the time of death, but Hall has developed a method that is pretty foolproof. He collects any insect life or maggots from a corpse and does calculations based on their size correlated against temperature. 'Obviously a crime scene is not a controlled environment but I work out how big they are, and within a range I can usually get to an answer.'</p> <p>I wonder how easy it is to get some of the things he witnesses out of his head. How do you avoid disgust? 'Sometimes it is extremely hard, but there is still a sense of profound curiosity about it all,' he adds, brightly. The point is, he says, that he has 'a huge amount of admiration for these kinds of flies'. There are, too, varieties that have developed only to live in particularly safe places - the nostril of a camel, or the stomach of a rhino. 'The fact is, all the time, you have to take your hat off to evolution.'</p> <p>That phrase might make a good motto for the museum as a whole. The more of its latest exhibits I meet - dragonfly expert Steve Brooks, and curator of arachnids Jan Beccaloni, a woman with a spidery tangle of hair and a line in gothic jewellery - the more I get a sense of the kind of passion for natural wonder that the 'exhibition of scientists' will project. I travel down to Southfields, in south London, to see Blanca Huertas, who is holed up in a warehouse with 3m butterflies in cases. Huertas, a woman who knows an awful lot about cocoons, cannot wait to move to the new building, though the task of transporting the collection is daunting. She is used to a challenge, however.</p> <p>Huertas grew up in Columbia and is engaged in an ongoing study of the butterfly life of some of her homeland's uncharted northern jungles. Her field trips generally involve her being dropped out of a helicopter in the remotest of places with a tent and a butterfly net. She comes back with a few thousand butterflies to catalogue. A couple of years ago she discovered both a new species of butterfly and a new species of bird in these forests. Some of the moths favour coca plants however, and the field work, she says, ruefully, is hampered a little by the presence of drug cartels.</p> <p>Huertas came to the museum first as a volunteer, but she has stayed, inspired by the history of the collection and its extraordinary range. As we talk she pulls open drawers from memory - here are some of Nabokov's radiant blue butterflies, here is a Queen Alexandra butterfly so big that in the 18th century when the first one was discovered the collector shot</p> <p>it with a gun, thinking it was a bird. It still has the hole through its wing. 'The thing is,' Huertas says, 'I believe you can explain everything with butterflies.' She was a teacher in Columbia for a while. 'It is,' she says, 'quite hard in Colombia to earn a full-time living as a butterfly collector. But as a teacher all I needed was butterflies: with them my students learned all about genetics, taxonomy, camouflage, evolution, physics, life and death ...'</p> <p>It is this kind of knowledge that she hopes the big cocoon will inspire. 'It's there to encourage a next generation of scientists, to prove that we are not boring men with lab coats or girls with awful glasses.'</p> <p>That may be the future but, for the time being, the closest the museum gets to proper interactivity is in the broom-cupboard office of the Insect Information Service. Stuart Hine sits surrounded by matchboxes and jiffy bags full of unusual creepy-crawlies that the great British public have found under their pillows or in their sock drawers. He and a colleague deal with about 4,000 such enquiries a year, plus a lively line in identifying refugees in imported foodstuffs: black widows in banana boxes, tarantulas in orange crates.</p> <p>Hine goes through his unusual in-tray. They have had a run on hornets ever since the BBC did a documentary about a giant oriental species, and everyone believes they have found one. In one bag is a bee with hairy feet - 'a hairy-footed flower bee'. And there is a strange collection of what look like dried dates: 'A chap in a jungle in India was recovering an engine from a Spitfire that crashed in the war and they discovered these - pupa cases from solitary bees.'</p> <p>Sometimes Hine is called to the front desk to be confronted with a live scorpion someone has found in their shoe after a holiday. Once, a man brought in something he'd found on his person in Richmond Park. Hine had to sit him down to explain it was a parasitic crab louse.</p> <p>Often it seems he is the 'go to' man for the whole world's bugs. 'We get in fruit flies that can devastate a whole country in the developing world, and because of the expertise here and the breadth of the collection, no one else can help - though these things evolve so fast that often they're new even to the specialists here.'</p> <p>At the other end of the scale there are plenty of regulars. 'A few old ladies with a bit of time on their hands will call to say, \"Ooh Stuart, I've found another one.\"' Whatever the enquiry, Hine clearly loves every minute of it. 'There are 23,500 insects and spiders in Britain and no one knows all of them, but I know most.' His purpose, and the purpose of the museum is clear. 'My single mission in life is to make people more aware of the life around them. It mystifies me that people are interested in what's on Mars when all of this stuff is at their feet to be handled and touched.'</p> <p>It feels very much like a quiet crusade, all of this; in fact just the kind of determined crusade, carried over four centuries, that might evolve a giant cocoon that will soon contain more of the planet's DNA than any other building on earth.</p> <h2>The curators</h2> <p><strong>Blanca Huertas, curator of butterflies</strong></p> <p>'I grew up in Bogota and when I was 12 I started collecting butterflies. By the age of 15 it was pretty much my obsession. I still go out into the field every six months. I don't go to research stations; I try to go to the really wild places. We have had a project since 2003 in Colombia, but now the drug gangs are there so it is a bit harder to go.</p> <p>You don't know immediately in the field that you have found a new species, but you have a good idea. You definitely start to be suspicious - it is something new, and sometimes: 'bingo!' Some people auction names of new butterflies to fund their collections, but we don't do that.</p> <p>I love the fact you can explain everything with them. It is quite hard in Columbia to earn a full-time living as a butterfly collector. But as a teacher I could explain everything with butterflies: genetics, taxonomy, camouflage, life and death.'</p> <p><strong>Martin Hall, forensic entomologist</strong></p> <p>'I get called in when the timing of death becomes an issue in a murder case. You collect maggots from the body and check their size, work out their gestation and correlate it against likely temperature. A crime scene is not a controlled environment, but within a range I can usually get to an answer. During the summer flies find the body very quickly and the process is speeded up.</p> <p>We just got a big grant from the government to get some imaging equipment that will allow us to look more closely at specimens, so we can collect more unusual visitors to a wound. The great thing here is that I can call on all the staff to help me to identify something. There is always someone who knows, even if I don't. It's not a new art though. There is evidence of forensic entymology being used in China in the 14th century. The suspects were lined up and the flies began to settle on the sickle of man who had committed the murder.'</p> <p><strong>Mark Spencer, curator of British and European herbariums</strong></p> <p>'One of the problems with the current building is that we have a 45C annual temperature range, which makes it hard to preserve the plants. The most ever-present danger are the little beetles. They love the daisy family and the carrot family; they'd happily munch through the entire collection. We are creating a pest-controlled environment in the cocoon - but beetles are cunning, and a few will no doubt get in.</p> <p>What I try to get across to people is the scale of the threat British plants are facing. The talk of the biodiversity crisis is not restricted to the Tropics. Take the stinging nettle, up until the late 18th century it was a very patchy and localised plant; but stinging nettles love nitrogen, and now because of the use of nitrate fertilisers their levels have gone through the roof. Two hundred years ago your average British ditch would have been full of a huge diversity of plants. That has all gone. Now it's full of nettles.'</p> <p><strong>Jan Beccaloni, curator of arachnids</strong></p> <p>'I look after all the things with eight legs, two body parts, no wings and jaws. The larger scorpions tend to be a wonderful kind of British racing green colour, but they lose that when they are dead. The best thing about them is that they fluoresce.</p> <p>It makes collecting them so easy. Once, we went out at night in South Africa and just held up a UV light and we saw them all running up trees and across the ground. Oddly, I'm a bit scared of the dark, and you have to be careful that when looking for scorpions you don't tread on something really unpleasant, that doesn't fluoresce, like a snake.</p> <p>Aside from the scorpions it's the big spiders that really take my fancy. But I'll have a go at anything really. I've been doing some work with the mite collection lately. It's one of those classic jobs - 'What did you do at the office today, darling?' 'Actually I spent the afternoon measuring a mite's anus.' But then my husband is the curator of cockroaches, so he's used to it. We tend to go on holidays to places where we can collect specimens - sometimes you feel you don't really need to leave your hotel room to get a good range of things.'</p> <p><strong>Steve Brooks, researcher in midges and climate change</strong></p> <p>'I've spent the past 15 years identifying the heads of midge larvae taken from the sediment in lakes and, with a knowledge of the environments different midges favour, looking at how the temperature has changed - with an accuracy of about one degree centigrade.</p> <p>We concentrate on the last 2.5m years. We know from the midges, for example, that the temperatures in Scotland fell by 5C in five or 10 years before the last Ice Age</p> <p>My real passion, though, is dragonflies. Ever since I can remember I have loved them. I used to go out pond dipping with my dad in Coventry and I got into the larvae mainly because they are really mean and they will eat anything you put in a container with them. I quite liked that. The adult emerging is a wonderful transformation that you can witness on your windowsill in the early hours of the morning. Oddly, these days things are actually looking up for dragonflies - climate change has definitely benefited them.'</p>",
  "<p>Newcastle and Durham and other parts of northern England today faced the risk of flooding as the death toll from two days of torrential rain rose to four.</p> <p>A 17-year-old girl on holiday in Wales, a motorcyclist travelling through North Yorkshire and a young couple from Plymouth all died in treacherous conditions on the roads yesterday.</p> <p>As the monsoon storms veered northwards, the Environment Agency (EA) warned that the threat of flooding was likely to increase as rainwater drained into river systems in the coming hours. The agency <a href=\"http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/subjects/flood/floodwarning/index.html\">issued five severe flood warnings</a> - meaning there is extreme danger to lives and property - and more than 200 flood warnings or watches covering swaths of the UK.</p> <p>Phil Rothwell, the head of flood risk management at the EA told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"The weather systems are moving, through the Midlands up to North Yorkshire and to the north-east of England and may turn around, the Met Office tell us, and come back to Manchester and north Wales again later in the day.</p> <p>\"We are expecting again considerable amounts of rain in these areas over the next 12 hours, so people do need to be really vigilant. Anyone who lives in an area which they know is prone to flooding needs to be very aware of the weather and very vigilant when they see that we are getting huge amounts of rainfall.\"</p> <p>The outlook was better for Wales and south-west England, which were badly hit yesterday, and those areas are expected to start drying out tomorrow.</p> <p>The storms have caused at least one death and brought misery and chaos to parts of Britain.</p> <p>A 17-year-old died after the 4x4 she was travelling in plunged into floodwater in a remote area of forestry in Powys, mid-Wales. Inspector Robert Price of Dyfed-Powys police said the girl and two other people were airlifted to hospital from the Llyn Briane reservoir area of the county.</p> <p>He said: \"A 4x4 overturned and came to rest in a river. Three people have been airlifted to Bronglais Hospital, Aberystwyth, two of them suffering from hypothermia. One casualty tragically died following arrival at the hospital.\"</p> <p>The officer said flood water from the river had caused the vehicle to \"lose its footing\" and tip into the river.</p> <p>Earlier yesterday, a man and a woman, named locally as Barry Rowe and Rebecca Hoynes, died when their vehicle hit with a tree. The accident happened in Embankment Road, Plymouth, in heavy rain.</p> <p>Details later emerged of a 42-year-old Sheffield man killed when the motorbike he was riding hit a tree branch on the A66 near Scotch Corner yesterday afternoon.</p> <p>Motorists faced long tailbacks and a busy weekend of sport was hit, with race meetings in Warwickshire, Newcastle, Merseyside, Worcestershire, and Dublin cancelled after last minute inspections. Cultural events have also been disrupted with many cancelled.</p> <p>Gloucestershire's biggest agricultural event, the Moreton-in-Marsh show, cancelled after an 11th-hour inspection, while today's big race meeting at Haydock Park, Merseyside, was abandoned after 35mm of rain. Within a few hours, race meetings at Stratford, Warwickshire; Gosforth Park, Newcastle; Leopardstown, Dublin; and Worcester, Worcestershire, followed suit.</p> <p>Throughout yesterday people were evacuated from homes and rescued from cars. Further misery was heaped on residents already hit by flooding. Carol Pritchard was contemplating abandoning her home in Lydney in Gloucestershire's Forest of Dean, after it was hit for the third time in a year.</p> <p>Holidaymakers saw their trips ruined with flash-floods at Budle Bay, Longframlington and Wooler while, in North Yorkshire, two women were rescued after their car became trapped by 2ft of water in Carlton. Police urged drivers to exercise caution as rain continued to cause flooding.</p> <p>But the floods were said to be \"nowhere near as bad\" as those in July last year. Flood barriers on the River Severn at Bewdley, Worcester and Upton-upon-Severn have been erected, but only as a precaution, while a rest centre in Tenbury Wells, Worcestershire, was closed down last night after floodwaters receded.</p> <p>Police warned pedestrians against walking through flooded areas and urged parents to stop children from playing in floodwater, which can become contaminated with sewage and chemicals.</p>",
  "<p>The 2008 Paralympics got underway in Beijing with a dazzling opening ceremony in the Bird's Nest stadium.</p> <p>The three-hour long ceremony, focusing on themes of time, space and life is expected to feature 6,000 performers and 4,000 disabled athletes from 148 countries. Britain's team of 206 athletes was led into the stadium by flag-bearer Danny Crates, who won gold in the 800m in Athens four years ago. Organiser Wang Wei said: \"We present two Games of equal splendour as a solemn commitment to the entire world.\"</p> <p>China welcomed world leaders to the ceremony, eager for another chance to cement its role as a global player to an international audience. The guest list included Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, German president Horst Koehler and South Korean prime minister Han Seung-soo. They shook hands and posed for photos with Chinese president Hu Jintao at the Great Hall of the People, the seat of China's legislature in Beijing before Hu gave a brief speech and toasted the Games.</p> <p>\"Caring for the disabled is an important symbol for social civilization and progress,\" Hu said before raising his glass. \"China's people and government have always attached great importance to the cause of the disabled. We insist on putting people first, carrying forward a humanitarian spirit and advocating equality and opposing discrimination.\" </p> <p>Opening just two weeks after the Beijing Olympics ended, the Paralympics are designed to be a parallel games for athletes with a wide range of physical disabilities. The 10-day competition begins Sunday and will run until September 17, featuring 20 different sports and and 472 medal events - 170 more than the Olympics.</p> <p>China is keen to use the Paralympics to underscore what it says it has done for the country's 83 million disabled citizens. The official Xinhua News Agency said Beijing used much of its $100m budget for the Paralympics to improve handicapped facilities in competition venues, airports, the public traffic system, hotels, hospitals and tourist attractions like the Great Wall and the Forbidden City. An editorial on the front page of the ruling Communist Party's People Daily newspaper hailed the Games as a \"stage for the world's handicapped people to realize their dreams.\" </p> <p>But the country has also had a contentious history with dealing with its disabled population. The government has long advocated sterilising mentally handicapped people. In the early 1990s, a draft law was presented to the legislature to reduce the number of disabled through abortion and sterilisation, a move that unleashed international criticism. In 1994, China ratified a law calling for the abortion of foetuses carrying hereditary diseases and restrictions on marriages among people suffering mental problems or contagious diseases.</p> <p>More recently, Beijing Olympic organisers issued an apology in June for clumsy stereotypes used to describe disabled athletes in an English-language manual compiled for thousands of volunteers. One section described the physically disabled as \"isolated, unsocial and introspective; they usually do not volunteer to contact people. They can be stubborn and controlling.\"</p>"
