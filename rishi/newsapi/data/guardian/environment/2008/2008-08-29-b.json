  "<h2>Who should pay when the elderly need care?</h2> <p>More of the familiar selfish complaints on the cost of institutional care for the elderly (Your Shout, August 23), and from a person who is apparently both indifferent yet very concerned about the depletion of a potential inheritance. </p> <p>Such people would do well to consider that in many European countries, for instance France and Belgium, the burden of long-term care can fall on the children after their parents' capital is exhausted. It is a great worry to a friend of mine, whose mother is already living in straitened circumstances now that her husband's Alzheimer's requires permanent residential care, and who faces the depressing prospect of himself having to shoulder the burden. If your correspondent lived in such a country, there would be a lot more point to these perverse and empty sophistries about the sense it makes to spend, spend, spend. Why not count the blessings we enjoy over here?</p> <p><strong>Name and address supplied</strong></p> <p>The anonymous person who complained about the need to sell his family home to pay for his mother's care would have learned this week that the situation is unlikely to change because the number of elderly has now exceeded the number of teenagers. One of the reasons that universal old age care cannot be given is that politicians could not disobey the electorate reluctance to pay the required level of taxation. </p> <p> May I also point out to this person that the parents would have been granted, until the early 90s, tax relief on their mortgage interest - a subsidy paid by other taxpayers including those too poor to be granted a mortgage. My parents were in this category. House inflation has given property owners a large amount of profit, making it easier for them to pay for their care.</p> <p>The loss of inheritance is partly caused by successful medicine, allowing people to live longer which eventually leaves many of them so infirm that they need residential care. </p> <p><strong>Bill Coughlan,</strong> Chelmsford, Essex</p> <p> At 66 I look after my disabled, dotty husband. </p> <p>I have just been in contact with Richard Burden, our MP, about having another cushion to raise the height of his lounge chair. The district nurse's office said that we were only allowed one as they were expensive. We were told that my husband could pick up the cushion from the kitchen and carry it with him through to the lounge when he wanted to change chairs. As he cannot move without a walking frame (he was blown up saving this country in 1944), and cannot possibly think ahead, this suggestion is not feasible.</p> <p> I pointed out to Richard Burden that we have both paid National Insurance all our lives, both paid into pensions, bought our own house (which is an utterly basic semi-detached), and have just enough savings to put us over the limit to receive any sort of help or assistance. No, my mistake, I got two grab handles and a garden step. </p> <p>In my next life I fully intend to eat gluttonously, live riotously, drink freely, smoke heavily, possibly experiment with drugs, and definitely not save any money.</p> <p>Please, \"name and address supplied\", do the same. </p> <p><strong>KM Whalley,</strong> Birmingham</p> <p>There are a few things worth considering before we decide that there is no point in saving if all our assets are then used to pay for our care in old age.</p> <p> I work as a social worker for older people and, in my experience, it can make an enormous difference to their quality of life if they have their own financial resources. </p> <p> If an older person needs a high level of care, and especially if they need care at night, social services will usually offer to provide this in a care home. Those in rented accommodation may, effectively, have little choice but to move into care, whether they want to or not. Those who own their own homes could, for example, get independent advice about equity release as a way of helping to pay for live-in care at home.</p> <p>Where people do want to move into a care home and are relying on state funding, it is social services that decides whether this can happen and where the older person can live. As a rule, social services supports people to live at home as long as it is practical and cost-effective for them to do so. If an older person wants to move into a care home when it is still possible and less expensive to look after them at home, the funding is unlikely to be agreed.</p> <p> If funding is agreed, social services is then likely to offer the least expensive care home place available at the time and, if the older person has no family able to pay a \"top-up\", this is usually where they move to. It may work very well, but they have precious little choice.</p> <p> So the two-tier system is alive and kicking and is likely to remain so until we are improbably converted to paying higher taxes. Those who have money or assets are much more able to choose for themselves where they live and when they move. People without generally have those decisions made for them by their local authority.</p> <p><strong>Susanna Watson, </strong>Bath</p> <h2>Paperless billing isn't as green as you think</h2> <p>Regarding Richard Colbey's complaint about Virgin and its switch to paperless billing (On paper they may have point, but I'm not buying it, August 16): there is a deeper issue. </p> <p>Every time you/we switch on the computer, we are using electricity, say from 35 to 300 watts, depending on the computer. The electricity comes from a power station. Most of those in UK use coal. Multiplied by millions of computer users, that's a lot of carbon dioxide emissions and global warming. </p> <p>Paper is made from trees, which are renewable, but there are many other complicating factors including the energy required to manufacture paper, the vehicles and machinery of the postal services etc. It is my guesstimate that, in toto, computers are causing more global warming than paper bills.</p> <p>At the Centre for Learning, Organic Agriculture and Appropriate Technology in India, which has no connection to the electricity grid, computers require the largest outlay of solar and micro-hydro electrical energy. Paper is recycled or composted.</p> <p><strong>Brian Jenkins,</strong> via email</p> <h2>How trains can vanish when you book online </h2> <p>Rail Europe's website is generally the best available for booking European trains online but it has other idiosyncrasies besides those you mention (When a fare deal isn't all that fair, August 23). </p> <p>Try, for example, as I did, booking from Rome to Milan around 9am and you will get a message saying the system cannot find any trains to match the request. Change the request to 7am and the site produces a list of five services, the last of which leaves Rome at 9.30am. You have to play with the site to get the best results! You are right to suggest that the Swiss Rail site is excellent for timetable inquiries. So too is the German Rail site. And for journeys within either Switzerland or Germany, the respective websites allow you to print your own ticket on payment by credit card.</p> <p>Finally, you give as an example of differing Rail Europe prices by phone or internet London to Cologne. German Rail is almost always cheaper for this, but only sells international tickets by phone.</p> <p><strong>Michael Scaife,</strong> Alderley Edge, Cheshire</p> <h2>Me, a jobsworth? Here's my card</h2> <p>While I was travelling on National Express East Coast today, the train manager announced that forgetting to bring your railcard was a breach of the terms and conditions, and that they would no longer refund excess fares even if you were able to present a railcard at a later date. Clearly the train bosses read Guardian Money and have taken their cue from your jobsworth correspondent of August 16.</p> <p><strong>Theodore Hong,</strong> Cambridge</p> <p>I claim the right to reply to the rash and incorrect assumption by Howard Peters that I am a \"jobsworth\" (Your Shout, August 23). I take great care to have the correct papers with me, to pay the congestion charge on time and not to go overdrawn at my bank etc. This is because I do not want to give any jobsworth an opportunity to penalise me. For the record, I am a tax consultant.</p> <p><strong>Peter Salter, </strong>London</p> <p>Amid all the righteous indignation over forgotten rail passes, can I offer a practical solution? When you have your ticket, put it in the same wallet as your railcard. That way, if you have one, you have the other.</p> <p><strong>Henry Malt,</strong> Huntingdon</p> <p>On a recent day trip to London from Stevenage, I saved 50% on the part of the journey that fell within Hertfordshire, simply by producing my concessionary travel card. In other words, I used my bus pass. As soon as the train left Herts. the normal price applied, but I was issued with all necessary tickets at the start of my journey.</p> <p>Cambridgeshire County Council says it has heard that some other counties allow this. Without emailing everyone, how can I find out which counties these might be? </p> <p><strong>Jennifer Kennerley,</strong> Croydon, Cambridgeshire</p> <h2>Would the real psychics please stand up! </h2> <p>In warning us against phoney psychics (The 10 biggest scams to watch out for, August 23) you imply that there are others who are entirely genuine with proven psychic ability. Please print a list. I don't think it will take too much space.</p> <p><strong>Geoff Booth, </strong>Knebworth, Herts</p>",
  "<p>\"We have become irrevocably more global.\" This sentiment is often repeated, but it was uttered in an unusual context earlier this month by the new president of the International Federation of Philosophical Societies, William McBride, at the conclusion of the five-yearly World Congress of Philosophy in Seoul. We're used to thinking about the globalisation of business and culture, but not of ideas.</p> <p>Whereas in most arenas globalisation tends to be taken to be a euphemism for westernisation, in philosophy it implies quite the opposite. The host nation Korea is a case in point. In the era of Japanese colonial rule, from 1910, study of Asian philosophy was all but wiped out. In its place came the western, usually German, tradition of Kant, Hegel, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche. Surprisingly, this orthodoxy was not imposed by the west, but by oriental Japan. It is only recently that indigenous philosophical traditions have begun to be taken seriously in Korean universities, and even now their study comprises only a third of the philosophy in higher education.</p> <p>The same pattern is emerging in other non-western nations. An Ethiopian philosopher, Workineh Kelbessa Golga, for instance, told me that his country's only philosophy department has conducted a lot of field work interviewing indigenous philosophic sages. </p> <p>Sometimes, this rediscovery of the local is accompanied by outright hostility to the western tradition. More than one speaker at the congress condemned \"western logic\" for imposing a too rigid \"either/or\" system of thought. But more often the desire was simply to promote a more pluralistic approach. This pluralistic agenda again contradicts one of the clich\u00e9s of globalisation: that it leads to a more uniform world. The globalisation of ideas looks like being a force for diversity, not homogeneity.</p> <p>But isn't there a worry that promoting the local rather the global in the realm of ideas will drive people further apart? Not according to Darryl Macer, who is running a Unesco project on Asian-Arab philosophic dialogue, several meetings of which were held at the congress. He believes you can increase dialogue across cultures by promoting the study and awareness of different philosophical traditions. This kind of unity in diversity is not as daft as it sounds: debate can take place only against a background where each participant is recognised as having something valuable and distinctive to contribute.</p> <p>The congress as a whole exemplified this principle. FISP had become \"irrevocably more global\" precisely because it had become more plural and international. The approach contrasts with the kind of parochialism that focuses on the local as though it were universal. For instance, in Britain, philosophy at Oxford and Cambridge has at times been so insular that people doing it there scarcely counted anything else as proper philosophy at all. </p> <p>It may be that we we can apply these lessons from the global exchange of of ideas to globalisation in the broader sense. For instance, many corporations are finding that their first attempts at global domination have come up against regional differences which have forced them to adapt. Starbucks has just made a massive retreat in Australia, which just didn't buy it, while McDonald's has got much more savvy in recent years about tailoring its offering to local demands. The free movement of goods, like the free movement of ideas, might just work better when there is more choice available, choice which reflects the different traditions of the trading nations. That way, globalisation need not always mean westernisation or standardisation.</p> <p>Whether or not the markets in ideas and goods are analogous, on the evidence of the congress the globalisation of ideas promises to inject fresh life into intellectual debates around the globe. Expect to read much more about how thoughts originating in unfamiliar times and places might help us to think about the here and now.<br><strong>Julian Biaggini</strong></p> <p>Margaret Thatcher reportedly kept Kipling's verse in her handbag, while Harold Macmillan and John Major munched their way through the novels of Anthony Trollope. David Cameron's literary tastes, however, are less predictable, judging by the curious exercise called Cameron on Cameron. The Tory leader enthuses to Dylan Jones about Sebastian Faulks's Enderby (\"brilliantly written\"), giving away the plot, and Ian Fleming's thrillers, but says \"my favourite novel would have to be Our Man in Havana or The End of the Affair ... [when young] I went through a manic Graham Greene phase and read every single novel. In fact I'm quite looking forward one day to reading them all again because I've forgotten them all. I just think he is wonderful, brilliant.\"</p> <p>Indeed, but also a leftwinger who regularly attacked US imperialism and supported movements such as the Sandinistas, who despised Ronald Reagan and was a friend of Fidel Castro. We'll have to await a more probing interviewer than Jones to learn how adoring his writing fits with rejecting his politics; but being a Greene fan seems of a piece with Cameron's naughty penchant for radical bands such as the Smiths and the Jam. Explaining his much-ridiculed choice of Paul Weller's anti-toff polemic \"The Eton Rifles\" as a favourite song earlier this year, he said: \"I don't see why the left should be the only ones allowed to listen to protest songs.\" <br><strong>John Dugdale</strong></p> <p>Did Alasdair Gray's Boswell save his life? It's a possibility raised by a bizarre incident towards the end of Rodge Glass's Alasdair Gray: A Secretary's Biography, when Glass - a novelist who for many years was the Glaswegian writer's amanuensis - and an intoxicated Gray were in Edinburgh during the festival. Suddenly Gray inexplicably broke into a run down the cobbled High Street with his secretary/biographer chasing, tripped, and \"went flying, head first, arms down at his side like a diver unafraid of hitting the pool head-first\". </p> <p>Fearful that his employer's \"skull could be splattered like a watermelon dropped from a great height\", Glass then somehow found himself lying underneath Gray, but unsure if he had thrown himself down heroically or simply tripped too. At any rate, the eccentric author's recovery was swift: once he'd heaved himself upright with a handy chain, Gray declared: \"You know, Rodge, sometimes I think women's bottoms are the only thing in the world that matters.\"<br><strong>JD</strong></p> <p>When is a chimp not a chimp? When it's the author of a book settling scores with some of the highest-carat figures from the golden age of Hollywood. Cheeta, we learn from his \"autobiography\" - longlisted this week for the Guardian first book prize - loved his Tarzan co-star Johnny Weissmuller, but couldn't see the point of Maureen O'Sullivan, aka Jane. Nor could she of him. Plausible enough, but the question that will face the Waterstone's reading groups as they whittle the 10 longlisted books down to a shortlist of five, is whether Me Cheeta is fact or fiction.<br><strong>Claire Armitstead</strong></p>",
  "<h2>Fizz goes out of Magners in summer sales chill</h2> <p>The amount of Magners cider sold in the UK is expected to sink by 15% for the six months to the end of August, with even steeper falls in Britain's pubs and bars. C&amp;C Group, the Irish company which led the \"over-ice\" renaissance in cider drinking, yesterday said an anticipated recovery in Magners sales volumes had not materialised in the last three months. It blamed \"the worsening economic environment, continuing competitive pressure and a slower realisation of the benefits of marketing initiatives\". C&amp;C said it expected difficult market conditions to continue at least until January.<br><strong>Simon Bowers</strong></p> <h2>Fund manager New Star's earnings slump 16%</h2> <p>New Star Asset Management yesterday reported a 16% slump in revenues to \u00a372.8m after a collapse in the value of its funds by more than \u00a33bn to \u00a319.8bn. The fund manager was among the top losers in London after the company slashed its dividend and said it did not expect market conditions to improve in the near future. Shares trading at more than 500p last year, fell to little more than 102p before climbing to 104p in the afternoon. New Star, like many others, has suffered outflows as investors shun equities and property mutual funds in favour of deposits and absolute-return funds.<br><strong>Phillip Inman</strong></p> <h2>Credit crunch curbs Land Rover production</h2> <p>Land Rover is to cut production because of the economic slowdown and the credit crunch. The company said yesterday there would be no redundancies or lay-offs among the 5,000-strong workforce as a result of the changes. India's Tata group, which acquired Land Rover and sister firm Jaguar this year, said it was important to match demand with supply. From next month until the end of the year, there will be no production of Discoveries or Sport models on Fridays and a \"slight slowing\" of the production line. Night shift manufacture of Range Rovers will be suspended from early October.<br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Property backlog fuels Rightmove profit surge</h2> <p>Property website Rightmove reported a 63% jump in first-half profits yesterday despite the worst downturn in the UK housing market since the early 1990s. Rightmove said pre-tax profit for the six months to June 30 was \u00a319.8m, up from \u00a312.13m last year. Revenues rose 49% to \u00a337.8m. The company said growth was driven by a strong increase in new membership from lettings agents and new homes developers. These firms pay a monthly fee for each property featured on Rightmove and as it takes longer to achieve a sale in the current climate, developers are paying more than a year ago.<br><strong>Kathryn Hopkins</strong></p>",
  "<p>Two weeks ago Dr Anne Guilding and her friends were relaxing in a restaurant, celebrating her son's wedding the day before. The food, wine and conversation were flowing. But then it suddenly turned ugly. No, there wasn't a bust-up between the in-laws. It was because one of the diners dared ask for some tap water so she could take a tablet.</p> <p>\"We had already spent hundreds of pounds, buying wine and expensive sparkling water. So I was gobsmacked when the waiter refused to bring us a jug of tap water, or even a glass. He told us it wasn't the restaurant's policy to serve tap water,\" says Guilding, whose party at the Brasserie El Prado in Bridgend included a member of the Welsh Assembly and a visiting American astonished that British restaurants don't automatically serve free water.</p> <p>\"I asked to speak to the manager, and explained that we had bought plenty of drinks and wanted some normal water. One member of the party needed to take medication and we did not consider asking for a jug of water unreasonable. He flatly refused to let us have any, reiterating that it was not the restaurant's policy.\"</p> <p>Guilding left the restaurant angry, embarrassed and humiliated. But ultimately the restaurant was the loser - the group decided not to leave a tip. The restaurant's owner, Jesus Decelas, says: \"Water costs us, the ice costs us, the lemon costs us. I have to charge.\" </p> <p>According to the National Consumer Council, Guilding's experience is depressingly common in Britain. Its research found that nine out of 10 restaurants fail to offer free tap water.</p> <p>A look at the Consumer Council for Water's website, where restaurant-goers can post reports of restaurant behaviour, reveals widespread anger and indignation about charging for tap water.</p> <p>One poster, \"Sharon\", says: \"When I was in Burger King recently, I started coughing and asked for some tap water. They refused even though I had tears running down my cheeks, as I struggled to stop coughing. They did offer to sell me a bottle of water; however, I decided to buy a coke instead as that was cheaper. Apparently, they don't 'do' tap water!\" Burger King told Guardian Money that the restaurant was wrong. It is company policy to provide customers with tap water on request.</p> <p>At a wedding in Birmingham, the hotel demanded \u00a35 per bottle of water placed on tables, and resisted fiercely when the couple asked for jugs of tap water instead. Pubs are named and shamed for charging as much as \u00a31 for a glass of tap water. Airports and railway stations are regularly cited as money-grabbers, removing free water fountains and effectively forcing travellers to buy bottled water at food outlets.</p> <p>Some restaurants even tell customers that water can't be provided for \"health and safety\" reasons.</p> <p>Dame Yve Buckland, chair of the Consumer Council for Water, says: \"As a country we have put \u00a370bn into the water industry. Tap water in Britain is now of the very highest quality and we urge restaurants to offer tap water to customers for free. You shouldn't have to feel like a cheapskate because you ask for tap water.\"</p> <p>But can you force a restaurant to give you free tap water? The tales on CCW's website (<a href=\"http://www.ccwater.org.uk\">ccwater.org.uk</a>) reveal widespread confusion over consumer law. </p> <p>Some tell of heated arguments in restaurants where diners insist that restaurants are required by law to provide free tap water. One says that under a law passed in Gladstone's time to promote temperance, restaurants are obliged to provide free tap water.</p> <p>Some in the trade believe that they are required to serve free water. \"As a retired hotelier and restaurateur, I was always led to believe that, by law, an innkeeper cannot refuse a traveller free water even if they do not spend any money at the establishment,\" says one poster on <a href=\"http://www.ccwater.org.uk\">ccwater.org.uk</a>.</p> <p>But these assertions are pure hokum. The truth is that in Britain there is no legal requirement on restaurants to provide free tap water to customers. Some pubs and other premises permitted to sell alcohol may have a clause in their licence that does require them to offer free tap water, but it's on a localised basis only.</p> <p>Sue Penniston, spokeswoman for the Drinking Water Inspectorate, part of Defra, says: \"There are a lot of misconceptions, some of which arose out of the Leah Betts case. In the wake of her death, a lot of large premises had clauses put into their licensing agreements which obliged them to offer tap water free of charge.</p> <p>\"But apart from that restriction, restaurants do not have to give you water and do not have to supply it for free.\" She adds that it's nonsense for establishments to refuse tap water on health and safety grounds. \"If a restaurant is on the public mains supply, the water is potable and there is no reason for it not to be supplied on health and safety grounds.\"</p> <p>In the absence of legal compulsion, Buckland is encouraging good practice among restaurant chains. Pizza Hut has said it will always give customers free tap water. Strada, a pizza chain, already serves customers free chilled tap water in a designer bottle. \"Strada is pleased to provide tap water free of charge throughout its restaurants as part of standard service,\" a spokeswoman says.</p> <p>Restaurants and retailers are also facing intense pressure from green campaigners. Earlier this year, environment minister Phil Woolas condemned the bottled water industry as \"morally unacceptable\". Mineral water suppliers on average use two litres of water for every litre put into a bottle. Much is transported from overseas, from as far away as New Zealand and Fiji. Four out of five bottles are plastic, most of which end up in landfill despite recycling initiatives, where it can take four centuries to decompose.</p> <p>Consumer campaigners Which? estimate that the number of plastic bottles sent to landfill each year would fill Wembley Stadium twice over. Which? describes bottled mineral water as an unnecessary drink that costs us \u00a31.68bn a year. The good news is that sales fell by 9% last year, and in the credit crunch sales are expected to fall further. \"Our reasons for buying bottled water are drying up,\" according to Which?</p> <p>United Utilities, one of the biggest UK water companies, has begun a campaign called \"tap into water\" that brings free tap water to events such as football matches and street festivals. Philip Green, UU chief executive says: \"At a time when we are facing such huge environmental challenges, buying bottled water at the rate of 3bn bottles a year in the UK is clearly unsustainable. I hope the hospitality industry will recognise their customers are environmentally aware and offer them free tap water without prejudice.\"</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:p.collinson@theguardian.com\">p.collinson@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<h2>The politics of global warming</h2> <p>Tim Flannery's review of books on climate change (\"Words of warming\", August 9) is a masterly survey of the state of the field that further drives home the imperative. But the crux is his last sentence - what will be done? Flannery pinpoints the change in public perception a couple of years ago but the writing has been on the wall since the 1970s. The puzzling thing is the lack of understanding and policy-making in the political establishment. This is surely in part due to the identification of climate change with environmentalism, something that Flannery's piece in many ways reinforces. The left has always seen environmentalism as elitist and regressive. The truth is that it is, and always has been, an economic and political issue, and is about equity - who gets what where, when and how.<br><strong>Neil Blackshaw</strong> Little Easton, Essex </p> <h2>Strike our</h2> <p>\"Stealing singles\", a phrase referred to by Mark Lawson in his essay on sport in fiction (\"The write track\", August 2) is not a baseball term. In baseball a single is a hit that propels the hitter, turned runner by the hit, to first base; it is not a score of one run, as it is in cricket. \"Stealing signals\", on the other hand, is a baseball term, and means an act of intelligence, where for example the catcher's hand-signals to the pitcher are correctly interpreted by the batting side - most likely by a runner on base - and conveyed to the batter at the plate and/or used to inform a decision, for instance whether to attempt to steal a base.<br><strong>George Rehin</strong>, Lewes, East Sussex </p> <p>Mark Lawson says John Updike's Rabbit Angstrom \"was a college basketaball star\", but he was a high school star who never went to college, an essential aspect of his character, and not only because it distinguishes him from his Harvard-educated creator.<br> <strong>Tom Whalen</strong> Stuttgart, Germany</p> <p>Mark Lawson is right to mention Brian Glanville, but wrong to say that Goalkeepers Are Crazy is a novel. It is a very good short story and first appeared, I think, in his collection of stories about football that bears its name. Glanville published at least one other collection of stories about football, The Director's Wife. He did write novels about football, however. The one I remember most fondly is The Rise of Gerry Logan<br><strong>Frank Edwards</strong> London </p> <h2>The right time to go to war</h2> <p>Ian Kershaw (\"The twisted road to war\", August 23) reflects the current conventional wisdom in suggesting that \"it is at least feasible that Chamberlain's capitulation at Munich proved ultimately beneficial to Britain.\" Kershaw displays some sympathy for Chamberlain's argument that Munich bought time for Britain to prepare for war; he suggests that Hitler's forces would probably have quickly vanquished the Czechs; and he says that the French if attacked in 1939, \"may well have caved in as they did in 1940\". </p> <p>There are grounds for challenging all these propositions. In the first place the British government wasted almost all the time (whether bought or not) devoted to rearmament by procuring the wrong things. This is evidenced by the zero contribution made by British ground and air forces to the avoidance of defeat in 1940. Had the British government devoted all its efforts to raising, training and arming half a dozen armoured divisions and an associated tactical air force, it might have been a very different story.</p> <p>Second, it seems likely that the Czechs could have made a far better fight of it in 1938 than the Poles did the following year. They had a powerful industrial base. They had a heavily defended frontier zone with Germany and although the Anschluss made it possible to bypass it to the south through Austria, this advantage was partly offset by poor communications. The Germans had at that stage only three panzer divisions. Nor was their advantage in the air by any means overwhelming.</p> <p>Third, the German planning assumption was that only five divisions, none armoured, would be left in the west to confront the entire French army, while the German Westwall, known to the British as the Siegfried Line, was not complete until the following year. As to \"caving in\", this is a misleading description of the way France fell to what was essentially a brilliantly planned and executed \"sucker punch\". Whether the German high command would have felt like taking the risk of carrying out a similar operation a year earlier, with only six panzer divisions instead of 10 against an opponent that vastly outnumbered them in tanks, seems very debatable.<br><strong>Michael Bell</strong>, London</p> <h2>Poet abjures murder</h2> <p>I read Elizabeth Lowry's article about Robert Browning (\"Portrait of a lady\", July 19) with mounting incredulity.

  "<p>The hunt for \"unlikely\" book titles was originally suggested by publisher Bruce Robertson as a diversion for bored visitors to the Frankfurt Book Fair. For the uninitiated, Frankfurt is a kind of global clearing house for books, a soulless collection of giant sheds with hundreds of thousands of titles on display. Robertson hoped his wheeze would provide publishers with a moment's diversion while plodding the aisles. There were some hot contenders at that fair 30 years ago - 100 Years Of British Rail Catering, Cooking With God, and 50 New Poodle Grooming Styles. But there was a single standout title: Proceedings Of The Second International Workshop On Nude Mice, published by the University of Tokyo Press. The Diagram Prize was born.</p> <p>The Diagram Prize celebrates the oddest of these odd titles. Forget the Booker, the Nobel or the Pulitzer: real book lovers and the literati agree that the Diagram transcends them all. Every year entries flood in from around the world, starting a spell of frenzied voting.</p> <p>From the early days the procedures of the Diagram Prize appear to have been deliberately vague. Run by the Bookseller magazine's diarist, Horace Bent, a legendary book-trade figure, the winners seem to have been settled by an anonymous group, probably over port at a London club. Any type of book was admissible, the only restriction being that publishers were not allowed to submit their own books, to screen out intentional efforts at oddness. In 1993 submissions were opened beyond the confines of Frankfurt. And as publishing output spiralled there were rich pickings. When the major publishing corporations tried to squeeze any remaining oddness out of the industry, digital printing technology sprang up, enabling quirkier small publishers to produce books for niche interests.</p> <p>Browsing the lists of Diagram Prize winners and runners-up, it is clear that medical research has provided one of the richest seams over the years: A Pictorial Book Of Tongue Coatings, A Colour Atlas Of Posterior Chamber Implants, or Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: A Personal View. Being so obsessed with their narrow field of research, medical authors often seem to miss ambiguity. So Practical Infectious Diseases was presumably not a how-to guide to infecting your enemies, while the 2003 favourite Hot Topics In Urology sounds painfully relevant. </p> <p>Nature's glories have often been celebrated in book form. I imagine that there was an avid, if specialist, readership for Six-Legged Sex: The Erotic Lives Of Bugs, as well as Neurosis Induced Cannibalism In Antarctic Pigs (edited by Pigman Press). Farmers everywhere presumably flocked to bookshops to snap up a copy of The Potatoes Of Bolivia: Their Breeding Value And Evolutionary Relationships. That's if the Celtic ones weren't already busy reading (and perhaps road-testing) the very personal manual titled Sex Instructions For Irish Farmers.</p> <p>Every respectable household still has its fair share of \"how to\" and hobby books; perhaps your own shelves include Drying Flowers With A Microwave, or Waterproofing Your Child. You are less likely to have a copy of the rare 1989 Diagram winner, How To Shit In The Woods, which was aimed at people who needed instruction in this \"lost art\". And what gentlemen could live without the Braces Owner's Manual: A Guide To The Wearing And Care Of Braces, or the essential companion to facial hygiene that is Nasal Maintenance?</p> <p>The Diagram is unique, and perhaps uniquely blessed, in that spotters and judges alike do not actually have to read the books in question. Indeed, they are actively discouraged from doing so, in case a close knowledge of the subject makes them realise the book is less odd than it first appears. The imagination should be allowed to run wild. Why, we wonder, did the author need so many pages to explain the art of Big And Very Big Hole Drilling? Did the level of local interest really merit an entire tome about the question Did Lewis Carroll Visit Llandudno? Surely a simple yes or no would have sufficed.</p> <p>In one instance at least, this habit of using an entire book to tackle a single issue seems positively reckless. When the captain of your little pleasure cruiser spots a ferry hull looming over the horizon, do you really want him to reach for a copy of How To Avoid Huge Ships?</p> <p>Sometimes odd titles can uncover whole new worlds. Take Proceedings Of The Eighteenth International Seaweed Symposium. Who would have known that since 1973, scientists have been meeting regularly to discuss pressing developments in seaweed (the next Seaweed Symposium is scheduled for Mexico 2010). I wonder if the same commitment has been shown in other fields. Did Proceedings Of The Sixth International Fatigue Congress have any sequels, or did the participants all grow tired of the ritual?</p> <p>Winning the Diagram brings no immediate monetary reward for the author; instead it is the spotter of the title who receives a \"fairly passable\" bottle (usually claret). But most winning authors have been delighted at the accolade and the ensuing media attention. Such publicity can transform the profile of a title, lifting it from academic obscurity to the front of bookshops. The 2006 winner, The Stray Shopping Carts Of Eastern North America: A Guide To Field Identification, was displayed in stores across the world.</p> <p>It's easy to sneer at such a book. But oddness is in the eye of the beholder. Thanks to <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com\">Amazon.com</a> we discover that some readers loved The Stray Shopping Carts Of Eastern North America: a certain S Fragomen hails it as a \"hilariously depressing work\", while AJ Fries observes that \"the author's language coupled with his beautiful photography give the lowly carts individual personalities.\" And while People Who Don't Know They're Dead picked up some terrible reviews, Mr Jeffrey Duncan found the book helpful: \"It sheds light on an area of the paranormal not often discussed, the idea of hitchhiker spirits... There is much wisdom here,\" he notes.</p> <p><strong>Pictures and edited text are extracted from How To Avoid Huge Ships, And Other Implausibly Titled Books, to be published by Aurum Press on September 5.

  "<p>Seumas Milne makes excellent points about the vital need for counterbalance and rules in international relations (Georgia is the graveyard of America's unipolar world, August 28) but unfortunately loses his own sense of balance in doing so. He omits or forgets that only four years ago Putin's Russia was still engaged in a brutal, far more deadly war against its own secessionists in Chechnya. To compound the hypocrisy, it employed military overflights and border incidents to threaten its southern neighbour with dire consequences if it meddled in Russian internal affairs. Double standards, anyone? </p> <p>So if Moscow accepted his point about counterbalance then it would pull back its own troops to allow a truly impartial international peacekeeping force for South Ossetia, drawn from countries in the OSCE or beyond, rather than deploy an expeditionary force to demonstrate Russian regional hegemony. And yes, Milne is also right that all states behave better faced with a rules-based system and counterbalancing interests, even global superpowers (though when exactly did the US demand a 20km buffer zone around Kosovo or distribute US passports in Grozny?). Well, his wish is half-granted: when Bush is finally history, at least some hope exists that an Obama administration, while still defending US interests, could act differently in a new rules-based, multipolar world. </p> <p>But then Milne draws the wrong conclusion: the \"real gripe\" surely is not with \"economic rivalry\", which is always with us. It's the cynical behaviour of the Medvedev-Putin twins in this new multipolar world and the example it is setting for other regional powers - that international relations is a game where the rules can be torn up when the balance looks to be in your favour.<br><strong>Keith Jinks</strong><br>Korneuburg, Austria</p>",
  "<h2>The winner</h2> <p>Ros puts her hand over the receiver. \"She says she's not sure whether they take mums.\" Ros and I exchange quizzical looks. </p> <p>The woman from the campsite is back on the line. \"Sorry about that,\" she tells Ros, \"it's groups and gazebos we don't take. It's just that we have had trouble with mums before - we find that they sit around drinking coffee while their kids run wild.\" </p> <p>\"But isn't that the whole point?\" I say. Anyway, Ros secures the booking and we get on with our packing. We arrive and I smuggle my gazebo in, disguised as a play tent.</p> <p>Cartmel Caravan and Camping Park, perfectly manicured, in full bloom and boasting its very own microclimate, is an idyll in the lesser spotted southern Lake District. And the loos are clean.</p> <p>We pitch our tents and get the kettle on - did I make that sound too easy? - and the kids run wild. Actually, after a few excited laps of the field they decide to put on a talent show and begin practising. Over coffee we read the campsite rules. Organised games are not permitted and children must be kept under control at all times. We tell the kids to be less organised. They don't get it. We are definitely in control.</p> <p>Cartmel is not only famous for its splendid 12th-century priory and its racecourse, but is also home to the Sticky Toffee Pudding Co, one of Rick Stein's food heroes. We make this a priority excursion.</p> <p>The stroll into Cartmel is more than pleasant, with opportunities to play poohsticks on the bridge (built 1829), nip into the gallery to buy something to hang on your wall/neck, and for light refreshment in the heavily beamed Royal Oak. The village store turns out to be a gastronomic delight and we emerge with more than just sticky toffee pudding. The dads are arriving at the weekend - they are our excuse.</p> <p>Back to camp for coffee. The children want to play \"Harry Potter\" and ask if they can go into the wood to collect wands. We discuss wet day plans: steam train to the Lakeside aquarium; Holker Hall, with motor museum (optional extra) and lunch opportunity; a steam train to Lakeside, from Hatherthwaite, this time with steamer boat trip on to Bowness; if it keeps raining, I don't think the Beatrix Potter centre is too far away. The kids are now shouting wildly as cows are blocking their escape route.</p> <p>The kids return. They want me to be Professor McGonnigal. I'd prefer to do Defence against the Dark Arts but decide not to say anything. </p> <p>Dry day plans include ... well, it's so lovely here that I reckon there's a lot to be said for just sitting around in a field all day drinking coffee while the kids flourish in their new-found freedom. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Cartmel Caravan and Camping Park (01539 536270). </p> <p><strong>Melanie Horton</strong> has won two return flights to New York with STA Travel.</p> <h2>Keeping up appearances<br>Costa del Azahar, Spain</h2> <p>The first thing you notice about Camping Tropicana on the Costa del Azahar, before you get to grips with the nipple fountains and caged spider monkeys, is the extraordinary sense of order. The staff are all multilingual and flit from Spanish to French to English to German to Dutch, which can be a little tricky if you just want a token for the tumble drier. They also like rules: </p> <p>Rule 1. Stop and step away from the vehicle!</p> <p>(We have of course already stopped and are now studying a laminated site map and rule book.)</p> <p>Rule 2. Collect a laminated site map and rule book from reception.</p> <p>(Like your thinking!)</p> <p>Rule 3. Choose your pitch. Select any three pitches from: yellow zone; blue zone; or green zone, unless marked with a white flag.</p> <p>(Okay, this is workable.)</p> <p>Rule 4. Pitches in the green zone bordered by a broken blue line can be selected only if: A. there are no free yellow zones or B. if marked with a white flag (see above).</p> <p>(Ah ...)</p> <p>Rule 5. If there are no free yellow, green or blue zones please select from a white zone (unless marked with a blue flag) in which case we are full!</p> <p>(Right ...)</p> <p>For us, Camping Tropicana is a pit-stop en route to Barcelona. For others it's an open air Ideal Home Exhibition. We are surrounded by elderly Dutch couples in caravans. Many, perhaps unaware that campsites tend to come with their own built-in floor, are busy laying linoleum. It seems tomorrow they are handing out rosettes for best turned-out pitch, with special awards for awning erection, tableware and light dusting beyond the call of duty. Competition's fierce: fridges to be hooked up, satellite dishes aligned, pot plants potashed, candelabras buffed. </p> <p>A priapic plaster of Paris Bacchus in the shower block notwithstanding, evenings are uneventful at Camping Playa Tropicana. At 8pm everyone retires inside to watch satellite TV and charge their mobiles. We too abandon the night time's meagre offerings to dust down our thermarests and prune the basil plant. I'm holding out for best newcomer on a limited budget. My wife feels the judges won't look kindly on open air pant drying.

We were enjoying a romantic beachfront dinner at the Season restaurant, when it slipped out: \"Let's go camping!\" I nearly choked on my pan-fried snapper. \"Trust me, you'll love it,\" he added. </p> <p>He said the same thing before he bought an Xbox. I ordered another bottle of Tasmanian pinot noir and changed the subject.</p> <p>The next day, with my Jimmy Choos protruding from my rucksack, we were on a Greyhound bus to Hervey Bay, launch pad of most excursions to Fraser Island. </p> <p>We opted for a three-day unguided group safari with Koala Adventures. In essence, we'd chosen to spend the next few days sharing camping equipment, food rations, and a four-wheel drive with a group of strangers.</p> <p>I nearly pulled out when we were shown the pre-trip safety video, which included tips on the quickest way to manoeuvre a jeep from a sand dune, what to do when confronted by a hungry wild dingo, and the crunch - the best way to dig a toilet in the sand. In the space of a day, I'd gone from private en suite to DIY toilet facilities. </p> <p>The Butchulla people - Fraser's original inhabitants - call the island K'gari, meaning paradise. It didn't take long to fathom why. We sped across empty beaches, swam in lakes and explored rainforests. At night we cooked and made merry beneath the stars. But what made the trip so special was our five fellow campers - a smorgasbord of nationalities, ages and characters. By the end of the trip we were like one big family, except we were happy and didn't want to part.</p> <p>After three days I was ready to leave. There's only so much dunny-digging a Sheila can take. At least my stilettos came in handy. <br><strong>Sarah Charsley, Brighton</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Koala Adventures (+61 7 4946 6446, <a href=\"http://www.koalaadventures.com\">koalaadventures.com</a>). </p> <h2>The other lake district<br>Uganda</h2> <p>Four hours west of Kampala is a small town called Fort Portal. The Bunyuruguru crater lake district is a half-hour drive away, on the back of a motorbike, by pick-up truck or squashed with 26 other people into a minibus that seats 12. </p> <p>Our first stop was Lake Nyabikere, where the CVK Hostel offers campsites or bandas (small roofed huts) with beds and mosquito nets from about \u00a33. The water is safe and refreshing to swim in, the bird life astoundingly varied and the weather hot but not oppressively so. You can hire a canoe to explore the lake itself, or hike through the hills on various walks with or without a guide.</p> <p>Lake Nkuruba is surrounded by tall trees. In an area with the highest primate density in the world, trees mean monkeys, lots of them. The babies swing from their mothers and look inquisitively at you from a few metres away. This theatre of nature is made all the sweeter by the knowledge that a few miles south people are being flown in to the national parks to pester the highly endangered mountain gorillas, for $500 an hour.</p> <p>The Bunyuruguru lake district is genuinely idyllic. Word is getting out though, leading to a proliferation of hotels although not yet visitors, so being the only guests in B&amp;Bs built for 60 people is a common and marvellous experience.<br><strong>Josh Heller, Sheffield</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>CVK Hostel (+256 7724 92274) </p> <h2>An American road trip<br>Rocky Mountain National Park</h2> <p>We've been road tripping for 10 days: living off restaurant gift-cards, free coffee and cool-box cream cheese. West from Kansas we headed straight to Vegas, dressed our best and drank dollar margaritas from plastic cups. Tonight, though, we push through dusk on cruise control and pitch our tent at Moraine Park campsite.</p> <p>Morning, and we're woken by the whir of generators and the low hum of breakfast. There's a friendly distance between campers, a quiet camaraderie born of bear fear and the short-term pleasure of communal living. When an old guy arrives with a truck full of wood and ice, we get in line and buy. </p> <p>In the afternoon it will rain so we jump into the car and make for the highest road. Everywhere signs plead that we stick to the path: \"Keep off the tundra!\" We canter higher, cameras in hand, gasping in the oxygen-lite air. Below us elk clump together. Black storms, hot from Kansas, stripe the horizon and threaten lightning. A ranger urges caution, but up here, where the trees grow sideways beside benevolent rocks, we believe ourselves untouchable and protected. </p> <p>In the evening we entertain ourselves by building a fire on our allotted grill. We bake potatoes and Olathe corn in foil, eat yellow mustard with our sausages and drop rum into our coke. Past 10pm a father and his son smoke cigars into the night; parents sleep soundly by their kids and we, drinking together, survey the bigness of the sky. <br><strong>Catherine Carter, London</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Moraine Park Campsite (<a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/romo/planyourvisit/camping.htm\">nps.gov/romo/planyourvisit/camping.htm</a>).</p> <h2>3,700 sq km to ourselves <br>Tanzania</h2> <p>An invitation from your 81-year-old mother-in law to go camping in the remote African bush might not be the ideal basis for a relaxing summer holiday. But Katherine is determined to make a special family visit to the malaria research station in rural Tanzania she ran with her late husband, Chris, in the 1950s. Tribes Travel is organising her trip and recommends staying at Babu's camp, in the Mkomazi game reserve in eastern Tanzania. </p> <p>The visitors' book at the main gate reveals that our party of eight are the only visitors in the entire reserve of 3,700 sq km. There are no signposts and little else to distract you from the rusty-red dust tracks, straw-coloured bush with green tufts of acacia and baobab trees, the purple-black Pare Mountains and the big skies.</p> <p>A walking safari in the intense equatorial heat with the camp manager, Seif, is fascinating. Animal tracks and droppings provide clues to the presence of giraffe, dik-dik and impala. There are 450 recorded species of birds in this area and, unlike in the bigger national parks, the larger animals are more reticent about performing for tourist cameras. We find an exquisite river frog in our loo, a hornbill calls at us from a nearby yellow-barked acacia tree, a giant brown moth sleeps in an empty whisky glass. </p> <p>Babu's is sensitive to its environment but retains an atmosphere of safari elegance. Pre-dinner drinks are selected from a temporary bar at the foot of a giant baobab tree and taken around a crackling campfire. Dinner itself is superb, particularly as there is no evidence of a kitchen or a chef. </p> <p>As Katherine recounts tales of taking blood samples from Masai warriors, we begin to get a feel for what it might have been like for her and Chris, more than 50 years ago, working in isolation in such a beautiful but forbidding wilderness.<br><strong>Stuart Heaver, Whitstable, Kent</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Tribes Travel (01728 685 971, <a href=\"http://www.tribes.co.uk\">tribes.co.uk</a>).

That is the best thing about being a literature student. Despite bucketfuls of debt, our holiday plans can still be decided by a well-turned phrase. For me that phrase told of \"chicory-fragrant caf\u00e9 au lait\", sipped slowly by the sea meadows of France's Midi. I called my friend Dylan. \"We have to go to the south of France. I'm reading a book and it says there are women there with serene dark faces and smooth skin as sleek as seals.\" </p> <p>\"I'm not camping in France. I was 10 last time and the discos made me cry,\" he replied. \"No discos, I promise.\"</p> <p>Dylan's second clause was that we encounter mountains along the way, so we devised a route that would begin in Aquitaine, arcing through the Pyrenees and ending along the Canal du Midi in the Mediterranean fishing port of Agde. Flying into Bordeaux, we rented a car and drove south, the roads plunging us deep into the Gascogne regional park then taking us to the coastal village of Messanges, 70km north of Biarritz. </p> <p>We raised our tent that evening amid the sticky pines of the Landes forest, in a little disco-free campsite attached to the farm Chez Cazou. Our first night's sleep came easily after two flagons of Madame Cazou's ros\u00e9 wine. Days were spent wheeling blissfully through shady woods and grilling fat sardines on empty swaths of silver beach. </p> <p>From there, we wove our way south and into the heart-stopping crooks of the Pyrenees, arriving at our next campsite, Les Tilleuls, just outside the mountain village of G\u00e8dre. The surrounding views of the Campbiehl and Cirque de Galvanie were celestial. </p> <p>On we travelled, via the pink city of Toulouse, towards Agde. Stopping outside the local boatyard at Camping Periniere, we bought food at the market. A wondrous end to a holiday, until we decided one evening to take a swim at the naturist resort of Cap d'Agde. \"Come on, we've hiked the Pyrenees, this will be easy,\" I said, suddenly noticing the advanced age of our fellow bathers. \"Sleek as seals you said ... \" cried Dylan, drowned out by the disco behind us.<br><strong>Leo Wallace, York</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Chez Cazou (+33 5 58 48 50 47); Les Tilleuls (+ 33 5.62.92.48.92 ).</p> <h2>Rain won't stop play <br>New Forest, Hampshire</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337083101\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/08/29/Camping2.jpg\" alt=\"Barbecuing in the New Forest rain\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Another British summer... barbecuing in the New Forest rain</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alison Miller</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We are smart campers.

Two canny adults and five teenagers in a van, we nod our heads wisely and tap the sides of our noses at holiday traffic heading north.</p> <p>We are pitching our tent in Hollands Wood, a Forestry Commission site near Brockenhurst. It is raining unremitting sheets. I can see a stripy windbreak close by, behind which stands a man with a can of Strongbow and behind him is the Taj Mahal of all dome tents. Strongbow man is getting comfortable for our tent-raising entertainment. No one takes charge as we manically bend and pop the springy tent poles.</p> <p>We are awake under the dome and listening to the rain. It sounds like a riff: soft notes of wind through leaves, staccato pricks of rain, thudding crescendo, gradually quieter. </p> <p>On day two we hire bikes in Brockenhurst. The teenagers have reluctantly pulled on an assortment of waterproof gear, the smallest boys wearing man-size waterproof trousers that make their legs look short and pedalling tricky. On the forest trails we switch between easy inclines to free-wheeling downhill. There are tunnels of oaks, ash and beech. When the sky turns grey it contrasts with the lush, vibrant green all around us. </p> <p>Put this shade of green in a paint pot and you could call it August green or English green.

However, it was sunny and the Lizard Peninsula beckoned. Rolo could come too, camping being a canine-friendly option.</p> <p>I collected together tent, camping kitchen, air bed, pegs etc. Phil arrived with some very fine wines and a large quantity of paper napkins. And golf clubs. I remembered the whisky, matches and washing up bowl ... but omitted to bring wellies. </p> <p>We arrived at our campsite to be met by the cheerful owner who asked if I would like him to buy me some wellies in Redruth. I laughingly dismissed this kindness and asked for directions by foot to Kennack Sands. </p> <p>We had yet to make camp and I had a large tent and a rather large novice camper on my hands. However, Phil soon became childishly excited and tackled tent pegs and guide ropes with enthusiasm. The bed was inflated, table and chairs set out, tea made - and the monsoon commenced.</p> <p>We discovered the sanctuary of the Cadgwith Cove Inn and a magnificent fish stew washed down with Doom Bar bitter. The next morning Rolo and I set off to explore Ruan Minor, a hamlet of 25 houses, not to be confused with the metropolis of Ruan Major (50 houses). </p> <p>Cornwall did not disappoint - we were fortified by Annie's pasties and Gear Farm pizzas. A day of sunshine enabled Rolo and me to walk along the coastal footpath from the Lizard to Coverack, a distance of 11 miles. Phil covered a similar distance on Mullion golf course. And we celebrated our last night in gale-lashed Kernow with a sumptious feast cooked by Phil, on a gas burner, inside the tent, washed down with some of that rather fine wine. <br><strong>Hazel North, Portland, Dorset</strong></p> <h2>Mini-camping <br>Holland</h2> <p>Mini-camping is the perfect holiday for those who seek peace and relaxation rather than mass entertainment and structured activity. These small sites are usually on farms (boerderijcamping) or in large private gardens. </p> <p>At Op den Diesdonk near Eindhoven we camped at a small farm in flat, traffic-free cycling country. Cycle paths criss-cross through fields of maize, along well signposted networks. De Groote Peel national park is nearby. There was a playground for children, trampolines, and a field of ponies and horses next to the camp. </p> <p>Further north and east near the lovely market town of Oldenzaal we camped at Erve Molman mini-camp. The Scoholten family live in a gleaming new farmhouse and offer the old farmhouse as a sitting and dining room for campers. The charming old town of Ootmarsum is a 10km cycle away through deep woods and glorious countryside and we rode into Oldenzaal for the Monday market. </p> <p>Despite more than a thousand sites being listed in the Kamperen guide, available from VVV tourist offices and <a href=\"http://www.Vekabo.nl\">Vekabo.nl</a>, mini camping is a well-kept secret.

  "<h2>The winner</h2> <p>Our party of four was split down the middle. Two didn't really want to go. It would rain, they said. It would be boring - just sitting looking at the water going past. But two of us were keen. My friend had spent idyllic childhood summers in the fields near Lechlade in the Cotswolds; and I had fond memories of the Thames at Folly Bridge in Oxford after A-levels, frisbeeing exercise books down among the college eights. The reluctant pair were talked round and so we were (half-heartedly) agreed: it was to be three nights aboard a little boat travelling from Lechlade, the highest navigable point of this lovely river, downhill to Abingdon - and back (which is uphill, don't forget, said the man).</p> <p>Rosie is an elderly tub of large girth who looks alarmingly wider than our first lock. One of us bravely volunteers to be captain and makes a dash for it. Rosie miraculously slides through the gates without demur, and lowers herself gracefully into the slimy trough of the lock as the other three of us sweat over the winding gear and haul on the ropes. No one falls in. The sun shines. </p> <p>We emerge into thick green skeins of underwater weed which wave languidly like the flowered strands of Ophelia's drowned hair. William Morris wanders over from Kelmscott to wish us bon voyage. Time passes. A tantalising streak of iridescent blue might be a kingfisher. We chug through dappled tunnels of overhanging willow, mesmerised and enchanted. Novels and knitting are set aside and the wary duo are inescapably seduced. </p> <p>The freedom of mooring randomly and without permission - laying the picnic rug among the buttercups and opening the ginger beer - is pure Enid Blyton. The cows squelch and drink nearby, unperturbed.</p> <p>Pretty riverside pubs slip past; terns plummet from the sky; great crested grebes jerk their inquisitive tufted heads then upend and vanish into the brown depths. We learn from disgruntled lock-keepers that their cottages are being sold off and their livelihoods truncated. When they are gone, who will fish the drunks out of the lock, they ask, or tow the inexperienced barges off the weir?</p> <p>Our nights are redolent of those long-ago rustic camping trips when mists rise and unseen small animals scurry and settle. Our pyjama-clad early mornings, with coffee on deck, are passed spying on the adult greylag geese and their offspring who paddle frantically behind, desperate to stay in the family safety zone. </p> <p>Approaching Folly Bridge, we're snared by a skulking sandbank. Our captain valiantly struggles with levers and orders us \"to the front end\" then \"to the back end\" in the hope that our combined weight will dislodge us and rescue our dignity. Finally released, we moor and take advantage of the only free parking in the centre of Oxford. </p> <p>We never do make it to Abingdon. Rosie is reluctantly pointed back towards those halcyon upper reaches where - this time - the flash of iridescent blue is definitely a kingfisher. </p> <p><strong>Jennifer Cousins</strong>, from Birmingham, has won a week's rivercruising holiday for two in Germany with European Boating Holidays.</p> <h2>Wiped out<br>Cornwall</h2> <p>Leaving the environment aside, it was my liver that really suffered the polluting effects of my decision to fly rather than drive with the rest of the group down to Cornwall. It was a sunny June day, there was a beach bar packed with curly-haired surfer types and my fellow holidaymakers were six hours away. By the time their car swerved into the car park I was, to steal the local lingo, wiped out.</p> <p>My weary friends arrived just in time for dinner, by which time I had sent messages (both textual and pictorial) of all the highlights our three-day break had to offer. Our balconies open on to the beach! The local ale is delicious! iPod players in the rooms! I'm going to learn to waveski! Curly-haired surfers! I think I spotted Jamie Oliver! </p> <p>Apparently the first 10 or so texts were entertaining and then their patience deteriorated in line with my spelling and ability to focus. Regardless, on inspection they soon agreed with my enthusiastic evaluation and after a few catch-up drinks they were as keen as me to learn how to waveski. At this point it didn't seem to matter that nobody had the faintest idea what waveskiing was.</p> <p>The hardcore among us were up early the next morning to head off to Padstow. As a Cornwall virgin I was genuinely taken by the town, whose charms were no doubt flattered by the blue skies and sunshine. We bought the finest beach cricket set Padstow had to offer and raced back to Watergate Bay. The beach was deserted, the barman was willing to deliver us plastic pints of San Miguel and the sun was still shining. And my team won.</p> <p>The last thing to mention is dinner at Fifteen. I've only positive comments about the location, the food and the service. However the highlight was the amusing banter we had with our long-suffering waiter. </p> <p>\"How is the starter?\" he asked.</p> <p>\"Great - 15 out of 15!\"</p> <p>\"Was that wine suitable?\" </p> <p>\"Certainly - 15 out of 15 in fact!\" <br><strong>Rebecca Salama, Richmond, London </strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Watergate Bay (01637 860 543, <a href=\"http://www.watergatebay.co.uk\">watergatebay.co.uk</a>), Fifteen Cornwall (01637 861 000, <a href=\"http://www.fifteencornwall.co.uk\">fifteencornwall.co.uk</a>).</p> <h2>Up, up and away<br>Bath</h2> <p>The sun shimmers off the water as I look up into the smiling face of my gondolier. I recline in my seat and we glide elegantly into a fetid drapery of decaying branches. Before I have time to take a breath, the gondolier bellyflops on top of me to avoid being knocked off the boat backwards. He's an idiot and it's our anniversary.</p> <p>Damp and leafy, we order a bottle of wine in the first riverside pub we encounter. This is day one of a romantic break in Bath, due to culminate in a champagne balloon flight over the city. From our seat on the bank we watch the river traffic and get tipsy. After several hours we decide we have been on the water long enough and punt rather unsteadily back to the boating station. </p> <p>After an anxious afternoon waiting for the balloon pilot's verdict on the weather, we finally get a call confirming the flight. Victoria Park is a rainbow canvas of inflatables, and as we find ours, the first are already rising towards the sky. A massive burner inflates the billowing bag until it stands momentously upright. A quick top up from the on-board flame and, ever so gently, we float above the park. The little cream terraces and crescents drop quickly away beneath. Up we rise into the silence until we can see the lush fertile bowl of the Cotswolds, golden in the mosquito-hazed light with the city hunkered cleanly in the bottom. With the fizz of champagne on our tongues and the long evening shadow of the balloon riding the ground beneath us, I forgive yesterday's bellyflop.<br><strong>Charlotte Chester, Leeds</strong></p> <h2>Dripping in character<br>Scotland</h2> <p>Scarista beach on the Western Isle of Harris could be Thailand or Zanzibar, if it wasn't for the fact that you need five layers of clothes - and the risk of frostbite. </p> <p>Pre-trip, I grew a beard for the warmth. We stayed in a leaking shack (described by the booking site as \"an authentic farmhouse dripping in Scottish character\") with a view of golden sands stretching for miles. </p> <p>There is nothing to do here, which is why we came. We spend much of our time enjoying the beach by walking sideways, to avoid being bruised by belting Atlantic winds. But the weather here is never grey. Torrential downpours bring forth colours - deep purples, the richest greens - in such a way that you never thought you'd enjoy getting so wet. </p> <p>There's a beauty in the bleakness, and small details shine in place of the sun. A tree becomes a show, a field of livestock a soap opera, the diminishing light in the sky keeps you from reading the stack of books you thought you'd need to while away the hours. Then there are the stars. When the clouds disappear just at the right moment, you'll feel you earned that view. <br><strong>David Bell, Edinburgh</strong></p> <h2>In the mood for dancing<br>Cornwall</h2> <p>\"It's Sunday, so no dancing,\" my husband reminds me as we walk across the fields behind our self-catering cottage in the far west of Cornwall. We're visiting the Merry Maidens, a circle of 19 standing stones. Myth has it that the maidens were turned to stone for dancing on the Sabbath. Luckily we prefer walking boots to dancing shoes. </p> <p>After paying our respects to the maidens we head for Lamorna Cove, a tiny harbour that smacks of smugglers and the Famous Five. The rocky coastal path westwards is slippery and slow, but we're in no hurry. We wallow in the warm May sunshine and the soul-soaring views of unbounded sea. </p> <p>Ahead lies a gem of a tea garden in the woods behind St Loy's Cove, accessible only to walkers. Would the best cream tea ever leave room for dinner? No problem. That evening we succumb to scallops, gurnard fillets and a sublime chocolate tart at 2 Fore Street, a bistro in Mousehole. </p> <p>Next morning we puff our way up the track behind the beach, heading for the rocky promontory known as Logan Rock. Here we lie in the grass and watch through a curtain of bluebells and foxgloves as the ebbing tide lays bare the stunning sands of Pednvounder beach. A mile inland at Treen the bustling Logan Rock Inn is just the place to finish the day with pleasing pub grub.</p> <p>I could ask no more of a holiday - art galleries, theatre under the stars, ancient sites, industrial heritage, good food, wonderful walking. But it was the breathtaking beauty of the coastal scenery that stole the show and made me want to dance for joy. Perhaps not on a Sunday, though.<br><strong>Sue Wallace, Chepstow</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>2 Fore Street (01736 731 164, <a href=\"http://www.2forestreet.co.uk\">2forestreet.co.uk</a>); Logan Rock Inn (01736 810 495).</p> <h2>Welsh wizards<br>Snowdonia</h2> <p>It started with an impulse. Driving west on the Llyn peninsula, with the Snowdonia mountain range on our left, we spotted on our OS map a winding descent to a beach with some derelict buildings. We took the turning, and followed a single-track lane descending through woods to a hairpin bend exposing a breathtaking view of sea, an old harbour and crumbling quarry. We had \"discovered\" Nant Gwrtheyrn - a once derelict village, now restored and opened in 1982 as a Welsh language and heritage centre. </p> <p>You can immerse yourself in learning Welsh, or just soak up the serenity of this isolated valley. That day it was brilliantly sunny. When we returned some months later, it was misty enough to recall the legend of Rhys and Meinir, the tragic story of Meinir's disappearance on her wedding morning and her reappearance years later as a skeleton in the tree which had been the site of their trysts. </p> <p>Fascinated by the blend of scenic splendour, industrial history, legend and the passion people have for their language, we booked a week's stay to learn Welsh. We played word games in Welsh, danced Welsh dances and unwound with bursts of singing. </p> <p>One afternoon we put our learning into practice by being taken to nearby Pwllheli. Tasked with making a small purchase, my efforts were rewarded in the Post Office with a smiling \"well done\" - in English.<br><strong>Gwyneth Parish, Oswestry, Shropshire</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Nant Gwrtheyrn (01758 750 334, nantgwrtheyrn.org).</p> <h2>No particular place to go<br>England</h2> <p>With no money, a dissertation to write and finding myself newly single with few unmarried/childless friends to travel with, this year I decided to take a new tack on the summer holiday.</p> <p>I jumped in a small, noisy car that was close to breaking point and drove. At first I drove to places I knew, scenes of weddings in far-flung parts of England, and childhood haunts. But after a while I longed for excitement and a sense of discovery; the kind of feelings you get, well, on holiday. It was on the A4074 between Oxford and Reading on a grey hungover Sunday that I felt a little rush. I'd noticed a little brown tourist sign which read \"Maharajah's Well\". Interesting. What well? What Maharajah? </p> <p>I made several near-accident-provoking turns to follow the brown signs all the way to their destination and found myself in the immaculately kept, quintessentially English village of Stoke Row. And the well didn't disappoint. The Maharajah's Well is an impressive 20ft oriental structure (complete with gold elephant) sitting proudly over the village well. Following that random brown sign had given me the feeling of discovery that I'd been lacking all summer.</p> <p>Ever since, I've been merrily living my little brown-signed revolution. I've discovered the varied, bizarre, sometimes boring, often hilarious but, most importantly, unknown and random destinations of the brown tourist sign. I've also invented a whole new verb: \"brown-signing\". Brilliant! Who needs a holiday?<br><strong>Amanda Hone, Bromley, Kent </strong></p> <h2>Gentlemen prefer boats<br>Llangollen canal</h2> <p>Gentleman Caller and I have narrowboated before but it's harder work than I remember, thanks to six fewer bodies on board this time around. With just two people steering and manhandling locks, there's little time for idling. Joshie, our rescue spaniel, happily took to it like the ducks he couldn't catch on the water. Regular lock stops saw him hopping on and off the boat, coming to grief in the wet stuff just twice. </p> <p>Many places welcome pets outside, which is fine - if the weather is. Typically, our weekend wasn't. Full marks, then, to the Cotton Arms at Wrenbury, which achieved the double distinction of serving tasty food and welcoming our canal-dunked dog. </p> <p>Given the limitations of holidaying with hound, our two-berth Mallard did us proud. It's certainly compact; Joshie curled up on his floor cushion was a perennial trip hazard, and the sofabed was, at best, a squeeze, but our boat was well proportioned and sufficiently equipped to see us through a week. Add to that the bonus of dictating your own schedule and you're certainly in for a change, if not much of a rest.<br><strong>Nicola Corp, Skipton, North Yorkshire</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong><a href=\"http://www.cottonarms.co.uk\">cottonarms.co.uk</a>.</p> <h2>One man and his bike<br>Outer Hebrides</h2> <p>I'd wanted to cycle the Outer Hebrides for 20 years and now - with the children old enough to leave at home with my wife without me feeling too guilty - was the time. What had put me off making the journey in the past was the time it took to get my bike to the Hebrides - and back again. Then I discovered a one-way cycle hire service and this, coupled with a return flight to Glasgow, made the trip viable.</p> <p>I hired a bike on Barra for a circuit of the island, then caught the ferry to Eriskay to pick up the one-way hire bike for the long pedal up the spine road along South Uist, Benbecula and North Uist. I spent two days exploring the scenic coastal road around Harris and finished by crossing to the west of Lewis to visit practically the only three attractions in the Hebrides: a stone circle, the broch and the blackhouse village. The beaches are stunning with an elemental beauty and the sort of white sand and clear blue sea that belongs in the Caribbean. </p> <p>I also enjoyed being on my own. I don't know what it is about cycling solo in Scotland but it does seem to attract middle-aged men like me. I met many, most memorably when having lunch with five other cyclists in a bus shelter during a downpour. (Phone boxes are good for this too if you're desperate but not so convivial.)<br><strong>Paul Kirkwood, York </strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>One-way cycle hire: Rothan (01870 620 283, <a href=\"http://www.rothan.com\">rothan.com</a>).</p> <h2>Monk business<br>Pembrokeshire</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337083352\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/08/29/Caldey.jpg\" alt=\"Caldey Island, Pembrokeshire\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Caldey Island, Pembrokeshire</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Born out of the mix of old and new, quaint and trendy, cosy and cool, Tenby possesses a tangible charm; fudge shops nestle next to wine bars and doily-filled cafes share customers with surf shops among the maze of pretty nooks and crannies. </p> <p>However, if like me you feel that true serenity can be found only on a secluded island, you can always take the short boat trip to monastic Caldey, home to Cistercian monks and an extensive variety of birdlife.</p> <p>Caldey may be tiny, but it is remarkably easy to lose the other daytrippers, who tend to gravitate towards the chocolate factory and gift shop. We climbed up past the imposing turrets of the priory and villagers' cottages to find ourselves on lush grassy dunes; a lighthouse to our left and waved carved cliffs to our right. We returned to the mainland, greeted by a tangerine sun setting over Tenby's multicoloured sky. It's easy to see how this dramatic beauty attracted the monks to this island in the 6th century.<br><strong>Josh Barron, Falmouth, Cornwall </strong></p>",
  "<p>The month of Ramadan and the virtues of generosity, sacrifice and sympathy that Ramadan emphasise are of enormous importance to me. Ramadan is a time for spiritual reflection and prayer. The fasting is intended to help teach self-discipline, generosity and appreciation of what we have, while empathising with those who have much less. It is a time not just to remember the suffering of the poor, but to do something about it. Ramadan is one of the five pillars of Islam and during the month of Ramadan Muslims are also encouraged to carry out their obligations to one of the other pillars of Islam: Zakah. The Arabic word means to purify by giving to the less fortunate. Zakah is a sum representing 2.5% of your savings which each year is given to the poor to relieve distress, to the needy so they are able to earn a livelihood, or to those struggling with debt. Payment of Zakah is a form of worship and its main importance lies in the fact that it fosters in us the quality of sacrifice and rids us of selfishness and greed.</p> <p>As a minister for international development, Ramadan really makes me appreciate the work that my staff at the department do. For people like me who had a romantic notion growing up that one day, through our politics, we would help change the world, working for the Department for International Development is nothing short of a blessing, because in our own small but not insignificant way, we are changing the world for the better. DfID is tasked with leading the UK's fight against global poverty. More than a billion people, one in five of the world's population, live in extreme poverty, on less than 65p a day. Ten million children die before their fifth birthday, most of them from preventable diseases. More than 113 million children do not go to school. In a world of growing wealth, such levels of human suffering and wasted potential are morally wrong. </p> <p>DfID works in 150 countries, mostly through national governments to support growth, job creation and improvement of basic services so that poverty and disease can be eliminated. In Bangladesh, where I was recently, during the past three years we have spent over \u00a3350m and helped to lift more than half a million people out of extreme poverty. </p> <p>In September Gordon Brown will travel to the UN, along with other world leaders, to encourage further progress on the millennium development goals, the targets agreed to tackle poverty and hunger, and improve education, health and environmental sustainability. We cannot allow our pledges to descend into mere aspirations, then wishful thinking, and finally broken promises. Together we are calling on governments, the private sector, civil society and faith groups to join an initiative to form new partnerships to help accelerate our progress. We can, inshallah, achieve our objective of making poverty and hunger history - and there is no better time to renew our vigour than during the holy month of Ramadan. </p> <p>I will be observing Ramadan and sharing Iftar meals with my family, friends and constituents. And I won't be alone; there are nearly 2 million Muslims in the UK. And despite the negative and often disturbing portrayal of Muslims by elements of the media, I truly believe that there is no better country in the world to live as a Muslim than Britain. The rights, privileges and freedoms we enjoy in the UK are second to none - in the Muslim world or the non-Muslim world. And I am especially proud that I am part of a government that is leading the world in eradicating poverty and disease, and that has set itself a historic target of 0.7% of our gross national income to be spent on overseas development assistance by 2013. </p> <p>In our interdependent world, it is in our interests to take as much pain out of the world as we are able, lest the pain land on our doorstep.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Shahid Malik MP, the first Muslim to become a UK government minister, works at the Department for International Development</p>",
  "<p>The Cairngorm mountains of north-east Scotland are Britain's Arctic. In winter, storm winds of up to 170mph rasp the upper shires of the range, and avalanches scour its lee slopes. Even in summer, snow lies in the deeper corries of the massif, sintering slowly into ice. The aurora borealis can be seen from its summits - billowing curtains of green or, more rarely, red light. In places, the wind blows so insistently that pine trees grow to just a few inches high, spreading across the ground in densely woven dwarf forests. It is a terrain shaped by what Nan Shepherd, in her masterpiece about the region, called \"the elementals\".</p> <p>Shepherd was born in Aberdeen in 1893 and died there in 1981, and during her long life she spent hundreds of days and covered thousands of miles exploring the Cairngorms on foot. Her reputation rests on the three modernist novels she published between 1928 and 1933 (The Quarry Wood, The Weatherhouse, A Pass in the Grampians), but to my mind her most important work is her least known - an 80-page prose meditation called The Living Mountain. Shepherd, who worked as a teacher for most of her life, wrote the book during the last years of the second world war and the first years of its aftermath. She then put the manuscript in a drawer for three decades, until finally she consented to its publication in 1977. It is now almost forgotten, kept admirably in print by Canongate, its admirers fierce but few. Given the current surge of interest in the literature of nature and place, however, it's a book that might - should - attract a new generation of readers.</p> <p>The Living Mountain is a difficult work to describe. A celebratory prose-poem? A geo-poetic quest? A philosophical inquiry into the nature of knowledge? None of these quite fits, though it is all of them in part. Shepherd herself called it \"a traffic of love\", with \"traffic\" implying \"exchange\" and \"mutuality\" rather than \"congestion\" or \"blockage\". Its prose is weathered in both senses: filled with different kinds of climate, but also the result of decades of contact with \"the elementals\". It is about the Cairngorms in the same way that Ulysses is about Dublin, or Mrs Dalloway is about London - which is to say, it is attentive to the specifics of its chosen landscape, but also passionately metaphysical. </p> <p>The book is in 12 sections, each of which explores an aspect of the Cairngorms and life on them: \"Water, Frost and Snow\", \"The Recesses\", \"The Senses\", \"Man\", \"Being\". Reading the book, you realise that these apparently separate sections are bound laterally to each other by rhymes of colour, thought and word, so that they form a transverse weave. In this way, too, the book's form acts out its central proposition, which is that the world will not fall into divisible realms, as an apple may be sliced, but is instead a meshwork of interrelations. \"So there I lie on the plateau,\" writes Shepherd. </p> <p>\"under me the central core of fire from which was thrust this grumbling grinding mass of plutonic rock, over me blue air, and between the fire of the rock and the fire of the sun, scree, soil and water, moss, grass, flower and tree, insect, bird and beast, wind, rain and snow - the total mountain.\"</p> <p>\"And\" is one of Shepherd's favourite words in The Living Mountain, being the conjunction that implies connection without hierarchy.</p> <p>Most works of mountain literature are written by men, and most male mountaineers are focused on the goal of the summit. Shepherd, however, goes into the Cairngorms aimlessly, \"merely to be with the mountain as one visits a friend, with no intention but to be with him\". \"I am on the plateau again, having gone round it like a dog in circles to see if it is a good place,\" she begins one section, \"I think it is, and I am to stay up here for a while.\"</p> <p>The Living Mountain is worth reading for its observational acuity alone. It is thick with the kinds of perception that come only from \"staying up for a while\"; from the repeated idle traversals of a landscape: \"Birch needs rain to release its odour. It is a scent with body to it, fruity like old brandy, and on a wet warm day one can be as good as drunk with it.\" Shepherd notices and records \"the coil over coil\" of a golden eagle's ascent on a thermal, \"the immature scarlet cups of the lichen\", the starry saxifrage and \"the white-winged ptarmigan\". She spends an October night in air that is \"bland as silk\", and while half-asleep feels herself become stone-like, \"rooted far down into immobility\". She notes how a river's currents can weave floating pine needles into balls, similar to wrens' nests: structures so intertwined that \"they can be lifted out of the water and kept for years, a botanical puzzle to those who have not been told the secret of their formation\". (These pine-needle balls are also surreptitious emblems of Shepherd's own tightly knit and tiny work, itself \"kept for years\".) </p> <p>Shepherd is a fierce looker, then. And like many fierce lookers, she is also a mystic, for whom empiricism is the first step to immanence. Her descriptions always move beyond the merely material. Up on the mountain, she writes, \"the eye sees what it didn't see before, or sees in a new way what it had already seen. So the ear, the other senses. These moments come unpredictably, yet governed, it would seem, by a law whose working is dimly understood.\" Like her friend and fellow modernist novelist Neil Gunn, and like the Scottish explorer-essayist WH Murray, Shepherd had read deeply in Buddhism. Shards of Zen philosophy glitter in the prose of all three writers, like mica flecks in granite. Reading their work now - with the fusion of Scottish culture and Buddhist metaphysics - remains astonishing: like seeing a Noh play performed in a kailyard, or chrysanthemums flourishing in a corrie. </p> <p>\"A mountain,\" writes Shepherd Zennishly, \"has an inside.\" It is a correct but counterintuitive proposition, for we tend to think of mountains in terms of their exteriors - peaks, plateaus, cliffs. But Shepherd is always looking inside the Cairngorm landscape. Again and again her eyes pry through surface: into cracks in rocks, into the luminous interior of lochs or rivers. \"Into\", in The Living Mountain, is a preposition that gains, through repeated use, the power of a verb. Shepherd is also fascinated by mirages of the mountain-world, the illusions that can be brought on by snow, mist, cloud or distance. She punningly calls these illusions \"misspellings\", visual errors that possess an accidental magic.</p> <p>In one memorable passage, Shepherd describes looking at a croft during a rain shower. The wet air acts as a lens, multiplying and redistributing her sightlines, so that she seems to view all sides of the barn simultaneously. Shepherd's own style possesses a similar stereoscopic quality. Reading The Living Mountain, you experience a curious visual dissonance. Your sight feels . . . scattered, as though you've suddenly gained the compound eye of a dragonfly. This effect is created by her refusal to privilege a single perspective. The prose watches now from the point of view of the eagle, now from that of the walker, now from that of the creeping juniper. In this way we are brought to see the earth \"as the earth must see itself\". </p> <p>\"That's the way to see the world, in our own bodies,\" wrote the poet, Buddhist and forester Gary Snyder, and his words could stand as an epigraph to The Living Mountain. For Shepherd, being outdoors is a profoundly sensuous experience: \"I am like a dog - smells excite me. The earthy smell of moss . . . is best savoured by grubbing.\" She lives off wild food, eating cranberries, cloudberries, blaeberries, drinking from the \"strong white\" water of rivers. She swims in lochs, and sleeps on hillsides, to be woken by the sharp press of a robin's claw upon her bare arm or the snuffle of a grazing deer. She records with brilliant exactness how frost \"stiffens the muscles of the chin\" (a part of the body we don't usually associate with muscularity, let alone thermometric sensitivity), or the pleasure of \"running my hand after rain through juniper . . . for the joy of the wet drops trickling over the palm\". For Shepherd, though, this sensuous relish was not an antagonist of thought, but its accomplice. In the mountains, she writes, \"the body may be said to think\". </p> <p>This is her book's most radical proposition. Radical, because Shepherd was a woman writing out of a Highland Scottish culture in which the cherishing of the body was not easily discussed. And radical because, as philosophy, it was cutting-edge. In the same years that Shepherd composed The Living Mountain, the French philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty developed his influential theory of the body-subject. For Merleau-Ponty, post-Cartesian philosophy had fallaciously divided body and mind. He argued instead that we are continually \"embedded\" in the \"flesh\" of the world: that we experience a constant exchange or \"traffic\" with our environment in ways that both exceed and inform our rational, intentional mind. His work, particularly The Phenomenology of Perception (1945), was dedicated to enriching the idea of the body, such that it could be said both to perceive and to think. Merleau-Ponty described this embodied experience as \"knowledge in the hands\", a phrase that could have come straight from Shepherd. \"The body is not . . . negligible,\" she wrote, \"but paramount\".</p> <p>\"The hands have an infinity of pleasure in them. The feel of things, textures, surfaces, rough things like cones and bark, smooth things like stalks and feathers and pebbles rounded by water, the teasing of gossamers . . . the scratchiness of lichen, the warmth of the sun, the sting of hail, the blunt blow of tumbling water, the flow of wind - nothing that I can touch or that touches me but has its own identity for the hand as much as for the eye.\"</p> <p>It's Shepherd's belief in what might be called \"bodily thinking\" that gives The Living Mountain its contemporary relevance. For more and more of us experience less and less contact with the world. We have come increasingly to forget that our minds are shaped by the bodily experience of being in the world - its spaces, textures, sounds, smells and habits - as well as by genetic traits we inherit and ideologies we absorb. We are, literally, losing touch. Shepherd saw this loss beginning more than 60 years ago, and her book both mourns it and warns against it: \"This is the innocence we have lost,\" she observes, \"living in one sense at a time to live all the way through.\" Her book is a wry, beautiful hymn to \"living all the way through\".</p> <p>And walking, for Shepherd, is the best way to \"live through\". On foot for hour after hour, you \"walk the flesh transparent\". \"On the mountain,\" she remarks in the book's closing sentences, \"I am beyond desire. It is not ecstasy . . . I am not out of myself, but in myself. I am. That is the final grace accorded from the mountain.\" This is Shepherd's version of Descartes's cogito - I walk therefore I am. She celebrates the metaphysical rhythm of the pedestrian, the iamb of the \"I am\", the beat of the placed and lifted foot.</p>",
  "<p>Some inventions are made faster than you can say serendipity. Penicillin, superglue, the microwave oven and the potato crisp were all discovered by accident. And suddenly we have an England one-day cricket team.</p> <p>\"Suddenly\" might not be the right word because one-day international cricket has been played since 1971 and England have not won a global tournament in all that time.</p> <p>But after almost four decades of pick'n'mixing, of sucking and seeing, of botching and fiddling, England have a one-day side that does look the part.</p> <p>England went into this series without the injured Ryan Sidebottom, their best fast bowler for more than a year. The former captain Paul Collingwood had recently resigned and was unavailable anyway and Tim Ambrose, with just 10 diffident runs in five innings, needed replacing behind the stumps.</p> <p>From these unpromising beginnings England have managed to put together a side to be reckoned with. South Africa, after the debacle at Trent Bridge, regrouped and prepared more intensely but were still outplayed by Kevin Pietersen's very confident-looking team.</p> <p>How they must wish they were going to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy next month. Well, perhaps not. But it will be interesting to see how they get on in India in November. South Africa, remember, could have overtaken Australia at the top of the ODI table with a convincing victory in this series. And England were seventh as recently as July.</p> <p>Pivotal in all this, as he is in the Test team, is the giant figure of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/andrew-flintoff\">Andrew Flintoff</a>. Batting at five and coming on second change yesterday, he was central to everything England did, despite being \"skulled\" by Morne Morkel when he had made 39.</p> <p>After successive scores of 78 at Headingley and here - he did not bat in Nottingham - Flintoff is thriving in his new responsibility with the bat. And the runs dry up when he and his mate Steve Harmison come on to bowl the middle overs.</p> <p>This is only possible because Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad have bowled well with the new ball. But this England side appears to have plenty of options when things do go wrong.</p> <p>There are eight bowlers to call on and that does not include Ian Bell. Everyone, including probably himself, seems to have forgotten that Bell can bowl.</p> <p>There is real depth in the batting too, with the eye-catching Samit Patel, who took five wickets in only his fourth match, going in at seven followed by Luke Wright and Broad. Ideally, Patel would be the second spinner. But another twirler, such as Graeme Swann or Adil Rashid, could always be brought in for Wright if the conditions prompted.</p> <p>Bell, his timing and placement making up for his lack of power, is developing a fruitful opening partnership with the normally more bellicose Matthew Prior and, even though he has not fired yet, Owais Shah looked a better bet at three than he did down the order. Then, after the dynamic duo of Pietersen and Flintoff, there is Collingwood to nurdle before Patel and the tail.</p> <p>No one booed South Africa yesterday. Everyone realised that for the third time in a row they had been hopelessly outplayed. The booing on Tuesday was strange in any case. If your football team wins 6-0 do you boo their opponents? It is time, instead, to give this England side a cheer.</p>",
  "<p>In a 24-hour rolling news cycle nothing lasts for long. Yesterday afternoon there was an almost audible screeching of gears as the blogocracy abandoned its post-Obama analysis mid-sentence and \"Sarah Palin\" became the hottest search terms on Google. John McCain's choice of the obscure Alaska governor as running mate caused enough shock and awe to wash the Denver convention off the airwaves. Which is a shame. For, in years to come - and especially if he becomes the first black president of the United States - the 2008 Democratic convention will rightly be remembered as Barack Obama's moment in history and for the climactic political theatre of his open-air acceptance speech on Thursday evening. What may not be so often recalled was the sometimes ruthless hard politics that went into Obama's success in Denver this week. It helped turn a convention that threatened up to the last minute to be unmanageable into a successful launchpad for the Democratic assault on the White House on November 4.</p> <p>First things, however, must be said first. The Democrats made bold, optimistic and wonderful history in Denver this week. No one with any sense of either America's past or of the long march for human justice can fail to be inspired by the sight of an American political party nominating a black man to lead a country with such a long, shameful and bloody history of racial division. That it should happen on the anniversary of the great speech in which Martin Luther King dreamed of the day in which his children would be judged, not by the colour of their skin, but by the content of their character, was magnificently fitting. Whether the majority of American voters in enough states will have enough confidence in Obama's campaign for change to elect him as their president remains to be seen. But it is the political question of the next 67 days.</p> <p>Mr Obama will not get elected just because he is an orator. His speech in Denver marked a recognition that elections are won on the basis of policy pledges and by framing the contest in a clear and sometimes confrontational way. In his acceptance speech, which will have been the first time that many voters have listened to him, Mr Obama framed the election as a classic contest between aspiration - the \"American promise\" - and fear. He offered a substantial menu of domestic spending promises on health, education and the environment, along with individual and small business tax cuts, though there was less detail about how he will pay for them. And he went on the offensive against Mr McCain on foreign and security policy, seeking to tie his opponent to the Bush years and hinting that he will make Mr McCain's age and temperament into campaign issues.</p> <p>All this shows that Mr Obama is a clear-eyed not a dewy-eyed campaigner. He managed the potentially divisive convention with great firmness, recognising that the supporters of Hillary Clinton must have their moments but never allowing them to indulge themselves. The Clintons, especially Bill Clinton, responded impeccably. But it was all done on Mr Obama's unflinching terms, and he was notably less conciliatory to his opponents in his speech than they were to him in theirs. </p> <p>Now, though, another fight begins, this time against opponents who will stop at nothing to exploit his weaknesses, which exist. Sarah Palin is a daring choice by McCain. She is a young, fresh, outside-the-Beltway conservative with great appeal to the republican grassroots. She is also massively inexperienced, at a stroke neutralising the very same charge against Obama. How, with an elderly potential president, Americans will judge governor Palin on the heartbeat test may prove critical in the months ahead. The times call for fresh vision and toughness. Mr Obama will need plenty of both if his dream is to become the reality for which we hope.</p>",
  "<p>To some they are a rural escape in the centre of the city, to others they are a chance to test their green fingers and design skills. Now London mayor Boris Johnson has found a new use for urban roof gardens - as a key weapon on the front line against global warming.</p> <p>An increase in the number of rooftop gardens to soak up rainwater across the capital is among a series of measures suggested by Johnson yesterday, as part of efforts to prepare London for the effects of climate change.</p> <p>The mayor's adaptation strategy, billed as a world first, aims to address the challenges of flooding, extreme temperatures and drought. It calls for compulsory water metering, greater awareness of flood risks and more tree planting, alongside stronger efforts to resist attempts by local authorities and insurance companies to fell existing urban trees. </p> <p>The mayor's team said they were also looking to copy a heatwave emergency plan used in US cities, including Philadelphia, where old and vulnerable people are collected in air-conditioned buses and taken to cool public buildings, such as libraries, shopping centres, churches and offices.</p> <p>Despite previously attacking the Kyoto Protocol - which regulates international carbon emissions - as \"pointless\" and saying that anxiety over climate change was \"partly a religious phenomenon\" Johnson now admits that the 2006 Stern review on the issue had convinced him of the need to act. \"When the facts change, you change your mind,\" he said. </p> <p>Launching the strategy at the Thames Barrier, in east London, he said: \"We need to concentrate efforts to slash carbon emissions and become more energy efficient in order to prevent dangerous climate change. But we also need to prepare for how our climate is expected to change in the future. The strategy outlines in detail the range of weather conditions facing London, which could both seriously threaten our quality of life, particularly that of the most vulnerable people, and endanger our pre-eminence as one of the world's leading cities.\" </p> <p>He said the strategy, which is a legal requirement under the Greater London Authority Act, put London in a strong position.</p> <p>\"London is not unique. All major cities, such as New York and Tokyo, are at risk from climate change,\" he said.</p> <p>The strategy does not address so-called mitigation of climate change - measures to reduce emissions - but Johnson said he supported a target set by the previous mayor, Ken Livingstone, to slash carbon pollution 60% by 2025. He said measures to meet the target would include incentives for Londoners to better insulate their homes and switch to more efficient condensing boilers. His team is assessing whether households could be given council tax rebates for adopting such energy-saving measures.</p> <p>Global warming is expected to give London and its surrounding area longer, hotter summers as well as warmer, wetter winters with the added problems of more frequent heatwaves, droughts and flash floods from rising sea levels and downpours. About 600 Londoners died as a result of the 2003 heatwave that killed about 15,000 in France, while low rainfall during 2004 and 2005 led to water shortages in the capital. </p> <p>Fifteen per cent of London is at high risk from flooding due to global warming - an area including 1.25 million people, almost half a million properties, more than 400 schools, 75 underground and railway stations, 10 hospitals and London City airport. At stake is an estimated \u00a3160bn worth of assets, not just in London, but along the Thames estuary, where large housing developments are planned.</p> <p>Johnson said work was under way to address stifling summertime temperatures on the underground network, with air cooling on subsurface tube lines to begin in 2010. By 2015, he said all trains on subsurface lines, around 35-40% of the network, would be air-cooled.</p> <p>The draft adaptation strategy, which will be finalised next year, calls for a citywide \"urban greening\" programme, using green spaces and trees to absorb and retain rainwater, and pledges to map London's drainage network to reduce surface water flood risk. It also recommends greater use of rainwater harvesting and \"grey water\" recycling in new buildings, as well as London-specific guidance for designers and architects to reduce the risk of buildings overheating in summer.</p> <p>Jenny Bates, of Friends of the Earth, said: \"It is essential that the capital prepares for the impacts of climate change, which is already affecting Londoners through increased flood risk, heavier and more frequent downpours and extreme heat. But Boris Johnson is also committed to cutting London's carbon dioxide emissions by 60% by 2025 in order to prevent dangerous climate change, and has so far failed to explain how he will achieve this. </p> <p>\"The mayor must provide a comprehensive action plan for reducing emissions that includes ways to make it cheaper and easier for Londoners to go green.\"</p> <h2>Key points</h2> <p><strong>On flooding</strong></p> <p>Citywide urban greening programme based on green spaces and trees to soak up water</p> <p>Campaign to raise public awareness of flood risk</p> <p>Identify and protect critical infrastructure and vulnerable communities</p> <p><strong>On drought</strong></p> <p>Reduce leakage from water mains</p> <p>Compulsory water metering where feasible</p> <p>Rainwater harvesting and 'grey water' use</p> <p><strong>On heatwaves</strong></p> <p>Enhanced access to air-cooled buildings for London's vulnerable people</p> <p>Specific guidance to architects</p> <p>Requirement for new developments to help cool the city</p>",
  "<p>Slandering brands on YouTube is something of a global sport, but big corporate responses are as varied as they are telling. Nike's reaction to an anonymous internet poster's assertion that Liu Xiang, the hurdler they sponsor, may have pulled out under pressure from Nike rather than because of an injury was met with the slightly terrifying statement that they had asked \"relevant government departments to investigate\". Contrast this with Electronic Arts' riposte to Levinator25, whose YouTube video of a glitch in Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08 shows the player taking a shot, \"Jesus-style\", from the surface of a water hazard. Rather than respond in an intimidating manner, they made their own video of the real Tiger doing exactly that, claiming that it wasn't a glitch, merely that Woods does walk on water.

So a summer stroll around Monty Don's two-acre sanctuary in Herefordshire is hardly the best cure for a sufferer. I can only whimper in jealousy at the orchard creaking with the fruit of more than 30 varieties of apple trees, or sigh at a bounty-laden vegetable garden perfectly framed by hornbeam and lime hedging. The only solace is that this is all the result of 20 years' hard graft. </p> <p>Newbie gardeners need all the hope and advice they can get, and Don, a contender for the title of \"Britain's best-loved gardener\", has been dishing out lashings of both for 15 years, in print and on television. But earlier this year he fell silent owing to a minor stroke - another notch on his life's long list of maladies including childhood bone marrow cancer, depression and peritonitis. </p> <p>As a result of the stroke, he stepped down as the main presenter of the BBC's Gardeners' World in April and postponed taking up his role as the new president of the Soil Association. On his doctor's advice he took \"gardening leave\" and has spent the summer \"pottering\" about at home or on his farm in the Black Mountains, and enjoying 12-hour sleeps, jettisoning the old workaholic regime of rising at 4.30am. </p> <p>\"I originally took six weeks off and at the end of six weeks I knew that I didn't really want to start work again this year,\" he says. Despite the occasional problem with his balance, he says he now feels no side effects of his stroke. A daily aspirin tablet to thin the blood, a weekly appointment with an acupuncturist and, of course, the tranquillity of his garden and the bosom of his family have helped him to recover from the dark days in February when he thought he was dying, asking his wife, Sarah, to hold him as he lay stricken in bed. </p> <p>Being forced to confront his own mortality has left him reappraising his life's direction. \"I'd always planned to leave Gardeners' World at the end of next year so I just thought, OK, I'll bring it forward by a year. I had become entrapped by it in a way that took me ages to realise.\"</p> <p>Spending a year, as he did in 2007, visiting 80 of the world's most arresting gardens for a BBC2 series sounds like a dream assignment to most, but it is evident that Don now views the stress of the 12-hour days and endless travel as a pivotal cause of his build-up of stress. Twice-weekly visits to Berryfields, the garden outside Stratford-upon-Avon where much of the filming for Gardeners' World takes place, also took their toll. He says he now feels no emotional attachment to Berryfields, even though he muddied his fingernails there for five years. And he displays no appetite to discuss the appointment of Toby Buckland as his replacement, a move which has upset followers of Carol Klein, with some accusing the BBC of ageism and sexism by overlooking the 63-year-old.</p> <p>Beyond the day-to-day stewardship of his garden and farm, Don now seems focused on his new role as president of the Soil Association. Next week, he will officially take up the post by handing out the rosettes at its annual food awards. But as he displayed at this year's Hay festival, when he entered head-first into the vexed should-we-buy-food-flown-in-from-abroad debate by saying that \"maybe third-world countries will have to suffer as a result of our national food policy\", he sees the brief of his new role as being a high-profile campaigner arguing for a wholesale change to the global food system. He intends to start doing this by rousing Britain's 11 million gardeners into growing as much of their own food as they can. </p> <p>A revival of the \"dig for victory\" ethos offers, he says, many environmental, health and economic benefits, not least at a time when sales of organic food have, as reported in the Guardian yesterday, fallen by a fifth since February due to the collective tightening of belts. \"We need to use our horticultural skills - which are second to none in the world - to grow food,\" he says. \"It's really important to get people aware of just how tenuous our food supply really is.\"</p> <p>Don sees plenty of obstacles, particularly the perception that the Soil Association is \"for wealthy, middle-class people indulging in their penchant for peasant food\". He intends to slay this view, partly by helping to steer the association towards adopting a more inclusive, advisory persona, as well as nurturing a \"for the people\" public image.</p> <p>\"We don't value food in Britain, so therefore the cheaper it is the better it is. We all eat far too much, we all pay far too little for our food. We have environmental problems, we have health problems, we have food transport problems. </p> <p>\"All one can do in the face of [criticism] is to say, 'You are entitled to your view, but these are things that need to be addressed'. The enemy or opponent we are taking on ...\" Just as Don is reaching the zenith of his battle cry, he is interrupted by shrieks from the kitchen. A grass snake has slithered under the counter and triggered mild panic, not least in the family's golden retriever puppy. Don coolly takes a pair of kitchen tongs, gently pincers the snake by its head, and carries it back out into the garden. Crisis over.</p> <p>He picks up the thread: \"By far the most dynamic age group growing food is the 28- to 38-year-olds, which is historically not a gardening age group. I think that most people are aware that it takes so much oil and water to produce what they're eating. But the problem is inherent within the solution, in so much as you don't want to tell people what to do. But you do want to encourage, enthuse and inform them.\"</p> <p>So will this lead him to host a campaigning television series, perhaps in the mould of Channel 4's much-discussed week of programmes in January about the chicken industry fronted by Jamie Oliver and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall?</p> <p>\"Yes, it's on the cards. Due to being ill, I put a stop to all work and officially I haven't committed myself to anything. But the danger is that by being on television you become part of the institution. I like the idea of fifth columnists and subversion. You don't stand on a podium with a loud-hailer telling people what to do, which the British absolutely hate. You've got to somehow get under the skin of the system and make lots and lots of small changes.\"</p> <p>Don sees himself helping to nurture networks of community gardeners who exchange seeds, labour, tools and time in order to grow food - in part inspired by al-Qaida. \"This terrifying, disastrous evil has actually usurped and upset the whole system. It makes you ask: what were they doing right? Well, they just bypassed, they stepped aside, they're just not there. You need to join together, not delegate ... to a government body.\"</p> <p>Don's huge distrust of politicians is much evident. \"My experience of working with government has not been fruitful, I have to say. I'm not aligned to any party, although, like many people, I feel very disillusioned by the current government, but don't feel very hopeful over any alternative. Power is not the right bit of kit to do this job. It's about going after the hearts and minds. Yes, there will always be: 'Why should this wealthy TV wanker tell me what to do?' and it's not a bad question. Why should I? But I think you've just got to allow people to reject what you say.\"</p> <p>One proposal Don suggests to help the Soil Association reach a wider audience is to reconsider the use of the term \"organic\". \"It's an albatross. Organic is loaded with a sense of rightness, with a set of rules. I would much rather someone bought food that was local and sustainable but not organic than bought organic food that had to be shipped across the world. We've got to move away from making people feel lesser because they're not [eating] organic. There is no doubt about it, 'sustainable' is a better expression for the same sorts of ideas than 'organic'.\"</p> <p>Don sits upright, apparently in the mood to slay further sacred cows. So what about GM food, previously an over-my-dead-body issue for the Soil Association? \"It's there to be debated,\" he says. \"You can't just say it's bad because it's bad. Plant breeding has been going on for millennia and it's a gradual process. At the moment I feel not nearly enough research is being done on the effects of GM and I have no faith at all in the goodwill of the producers and their motives. [But] my overall feeling is that I would not discount anything.\"</p> <p>So is this new, blood-pumping, campaigning role really going to offer him the stress-free life his doctors no doubt recommend? He says he will take it slowly at first, but that he already feels buoyed and renewed by the thought of challenge ahead: \"I do feel optimistic. But I also feel that I'm 53, both my parents died in their sixties, and you've got to leave this world in a better place that you find it. You've got take the fuckers on and not just give in.\"</p>",
  "<p>In the long grass near the edge of a small loch, Toby the springer spaniel is hard at work. Harness on, head down, he zigzags through the undergrowth until something stops him in his tracks. He puts his nose to the ground, tail flicking frantically. Before him, hidden in the vegetation, is a remnant of a bumblebees' nest.</p> <p>Toby is the latest weapon in an effort to try to understand what is happening to Britain's bumblebees. He is the world's first bee-sniffing dog, trained by the army, and based at Stirling University, where researchers have a \u00a3112,000 grant to study the bees' decline.</p> <p>Like honeybees, the British bumblebee is under threat. There used to be 25 different species of bumblebee in the UK. Three are extinct and up to seven more are close to extinction. Habitat loss is the biggest threat. Intensive farming means fewer areas where the bees can flourish, such as hay meadows and clover leys. </p> <p>\"If we are going to conserve them, we need to know more about them, where they live, what causes the nests to die,\" says Professor Dave Goulson of the university's school of biological and environmental sciences. \"The last few years have been really bad for bumblebees. We think it's probably the weather, but we don't know. We need to know how many nests there are. We need to find the nests to know how long they live and what destroys them.\"</p> <p>The trouble with bumblebees is that their nests are smaller than a honeybee hive and are often hidden underground. As few as 50 bees can live in one nest. One of the bees' main predators is the badger, and it occurred to the Stirling team that if badgers could sniff out bee nests, then so could a dog. They approached the army and provided the funds to train Toby, who had been rescued from an animal pound in the Midlands and now lives on a farm with his handler, PhD student Steph O' Connor. </p> <p>It is absolutely crucial work, says Goulson. \"Bumblebees are very important to the environment as pollinators of crops and flowers, but sadly they are struggling to survive in the modern world of habitat loss, pesticides and intensive agriculture,\" he said. \"Further decline in bumblebees could result in a downward cycle of poorer harvests and sweeping changes to the countryside, as wild flowers set less seed and disappear, which, in turn, could have catastrophic effects for other wildlife.\"</p> <p>The university team works alongside the Stirling-based Bumblebee Conservation Trust, which, with the help of the RSPB, recently set up the world's first bumblebee sanctuary in Fife, a large wildflower meadow, which is attracting a wide variety of bees.</p>",
  "<p>Right now is both a good time and a bad time to publish a book about road traffic. There is more of it in the world than ever before. Tom Vanderbilt cites the now-familiar statistics about surging car ownership in China; sets out the social implications of the new American drive-through branches of Starbucks; notes the global appetite for building and living in ever more far-flung suburbs. And yet, given the rise in oil and petrol prices, the international economic slowdown, and the deepening fear of carbon emissions, it is less possible, suddenly, to say with certainty that the road traffic boom of the last half century will continue through the next one.</p> <p>Around such tensions fascinating non-fiction books can be constructed, but Vanderbilt's subject is the boom and not the threats to it. \"I have avoided talking about the negative environmental consequences of the car,\" he writes near the end. \"With fuel economy liberated by some renewable, sustainable fuel source of the future, all the dynamics of traffic I have described will only become more amplified.\" It is the sort of airy, optimistic prediction you might expect someone from a car company to make. And indeed the next person quoted is General Motors' \"vice-president of R&amp;D and strategic planning\". </p> <p>The first half of Vanderbilt's book is a sociological study of car driving, as accessible, busy and intricate as an LA freeway intersection. It is written in the conversational, fancy-that style - chapter titles include \"Why Does the Other Lane Always Seem Faster?\" and \"Why Ants Don't Get into Traffic Jams (and Humans Do)\" - familiar to readers of science pieces in the New Yorker and bestselling books such as The Tipping Point by Malcolm Gladwell. The advantages of this style are clarity of argument and an invigorating sense of curiosity; the disadvantages can be a cloying cuteness of tone and a slightly patronising quality, as if a very clever young man is patiently explaining the world to his younger brother. </p> <p>\"Let me ask you two questions,\" writes Vanderbilt. \"What route did you take to get home today? And what was the colour of your first car? . . . Chances are, your eyes drifted away from the page. Humans . . . tend to look away when asked to remember something . . . Now picture driving down a street, talking to someone on a mobile phone, and they ask you . . . where you left the spare keys.\" It's a neat illustration of one of his main and most disconcerting themes, the sketchiness of what we actually see when we're driving. But the book is so full of these page-long summaries of traffic-related experiments, conducted by Vanderbilt or by traffic engineers and scientists, that they gradually begin to swish past the reader in a blur.</p> <p>There are lots of medium-sized revelations here. Vanderbilt shows that a \"one-hour rule\" for commuting - the readiness of most people to arrange their lives around a half-hour journey to work but not a longer one - has endured in societies from ancient Rome to modern America. As technology has changed, and the distance that can be travelled in half an hour with it, so cities have expanded accordingly. The book also shows that the idea that building more transport infrastructure generates more traffic was around even before there were many cars. In 1900, the head of the New York subway warned that for his city, and by implication those like it, \"There is no such thing as a solution to the rapid transit problem. By the time the [new] railway is completed, areas that are now given over to rocks and goats will be covered with houses.\" </p> <p>However, some of the book's other findings seem entirely unsurprising. While driving, we learn, people are more assertive, more self-centred, more narrow-minded. People are bad at making rational calculations about the quickest road to take. Traffic engineers remain baffled by some aspects of how traffic flows, or doesn't flow. Vanderbilt travels all over America, Europe and Asia, interviewing, driving vehicles and simulators, even learning how to skid on a rubber-smeared racetrack in Arizona; but sometimes you wonder whether his exhaustive research is intended primarily to yield insights or just entertaining colour.</p> <p>The book is also very car-focused. Buses, motorcycles and bicycles feature little in the opening, agenda-setting chapters, and then usually as part of the landscape negotiated by drivers rather than as equal participants in the jostle for roadspace. Pedestrians and their experience of traffic are even more neglected, lost in Vanderbilt's peripheral vision as his eager prose bowls along, or makes a geeky detour to talk about the experimental introduction on a Minnesota freeway of the \"Dynamic Late Merge\". </p> <p>Fortunately, for its last third the book opens out. Vanderbilt goes to Holland and meets Hans Monderman, the late guru of the Shared Space movement, a radical group of traffic engineers who have become increasingly influential since the 80s, and who believe the way to make drivers socially responsible is by removing roadsigns and kerbs and forcing them to co-exist with pedestrians and other road users. For once, Vanderbilt does not rush through the material but spends a dozen pages describing and pondering Monderman's innovations. At one point the Dutchman demonstrates his faith in \"shared space\" by walking backwards with his eyes closed across a busy roundabout he has designed. \"Cars and cyclists,\" writes Vanderbilt, \"steered around him, slowly.\" </p> <p>Whether the interactions on the asphalt would be quite so considerate in more car-dominated societies such as Britain and America, let alone in the sort of society China is becoming, is open to question. But Vanderbilt, whose author biography tells us he drives a seven-year-old Volvo, comes out in the final chapters as more interestingly ambivalent about the dominance of the car than you might initially imagine. This is still a slightly sterile book - there is nothing on the whole culture and iconography of the open road, or on roads and crime, for example - but it leaves you with more to chew on than this sort of processed social science usually does. I just wonder how Traffic will look on my bookshelf when the oil runs out. </p> <p>\u2022 Andy Beckett is writing a book for Faber about British politics in the 70s.</p>",

  "<p>Senior churchmen yesterday rejected proposals designed to avoid a schism in the Anglican Communion, insisting they would continue to develop their own global movement for conservative evangelicals and offer it as an alternative solution to the current crisis over homosexuality. </p> <p>Six primates, who between them claim to represent half of the world's Anglicans, issued a communique saying they were \"saddened\" by the Lambeth conference, the 10-yearly gathering held last month in Canterbury, for failing to offer a \"more effective way forward\".</p> <p>The communique follows their meeting, in London last week, to establish a council, an advisory board and a secretariat for the Global Anglican Future Conference (Gafcon) and the Fellowship of Confessing Anglicans (Foca). </p> <p>All but one of the signatories, the Archbishop of the Southern Cone, boycotted Lambeth, partly because of invitations extended to prominent liberal bishops. </p> <p>The primates said their \"immediate difficulty\" was that the voice of Lambeth 2008 was \"seriously weakened\" because it repeated what had already been said in previous summits aimed at healing deep divisions over the ordination of gay bishops and the blessing of same-sex unions. </p> <p>In a swipe at the Archbishop of Canterbury, who earlier this month expressed his optimism and hope about the future of the Anglican Communion, they said: \"The hope that we may somehow return to the state of affairs before 2003 is an illusion.\"</p> <p>The Archbishop of Sydney and newly-appointed Gafcon secretary, the Right Rev Peter Jensen, said: \"At Lambeth there was talk of building bridges but as far as I know there has been no approach made. </p> <p>\"The communique is on the right track.

  "<p>The pharmaceutical industry is under siege with the looming end of blockbuster drugs, imminent patent expiries on top-selling medicines and government pressure to lower prices amid accusations of profiteering.</p> <p>GlaxoSmithKline's new boss, Andrew Witty, has likened discovering a blockbuster - with annual revenues of at least $1bn - to finding a needle in a haystack. Many of the big-selling medicines launched in the 1990s are about to come off patent, allowing generic drugmakers to make cheaper versions. Only four of the 10 major companies have enough products in their pipeline to plug the looming revenue shortfall.</p> <p>\"We've seen the end of the very big blockbuster, the likes of Lipitor,\" said Kate Moss at PricewaterhouseCoopers. \"There's not enough time for a product to become a massive blockbuster. There's so much competition in the market.\"</p> <p>The world's top-selling drug, Lipitor, will lose its patent in 2011, threatening Pfizer's $12.7bn (\u00a37bn) annual sales from the anti-cholesterol drug.</p> <p>Professor Sir Michael Rawlins, who chairs health watchdog Nice, infuriated the industry last week when he accused it of overpricing vital new medicines. But drugs companies reject the charge, pointing to initiatives on pricing. The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) says UK drug prices have fallen by 21% in real terms over the past decade. </p> <p>\"It takes \u00a3550m - and 10-12 years - to bring a new drug to the patient,\" said a spokeswoman. \"It's an investment in public health. It's only natural that the companies need to make a return on this initial investment.\" </p> <p>Nice refused to approve expensive new kidney drugs for NHS use, saying they are not cost effective - despite an offer from Pfizer to pay for the first round of treatments. </p> <p>The move highlights efforts by Big Pharma to be more flexible on pricing. Under an innovative funding scheme, Johnson &amp; Johnson allowed the NHS to recoup the cost of its Velcade medicine for bone marrow cancer if patients show no or minimal improvement. At GSK, Europe's biggest drugmaker, Witty has proposed a \"pricing for value\" model. Under the formula, companies would be paid little for new drugs at the outset but would be reimbursed fully once their value is proven. </p> <p>Richard Barker, ABPI director general, said: \"Nice needs to combine pure economic arithmetic with other considerations: the severity of the condition, the availability of alternative treatments, the consequences of refusing treatment in terms of the length and quality of life, and the savings in the use of carers.\"</p> <p><strong>Nice and early</strong></p> <p>In another important move, the industry and Nice would get together at an earlier stage to discuss which drugs the government is likely to fund when they come to market. Under a recent pilot project, Swiss group Novartis discussed new drugs with Nice before clinical trials were designed. GSK now talks to the health watchdog from phase II of drug trials - the intermediate stage of development - rather than afterwards.</p> <p>\"The idea of early dialogue is now accepted on both sides,\" said Barker.</p> <p>Moss pointed out that regulators at Nice will need to have the right skills to analyse early clinical data. Drugmakers, for their part, should carry out tests to determine which patients benefit from a drug so that their use can be targeted.</p> <p>The cost of R&amp;D has risen as companies chase fewer new molecules. Alan Sheppard at consultancy IMS Health reckons the chances of discovering a blockbuster have halved from 10-1 to 20-1. He cited competition, pricing, safety concerns and fewer unmet clinical needs. \"The increased rigour in being able to get a product to market means that far more molecules have to be screened before a likely candidate can be positively identified,\" he said. </p> <p>In response, companies are targeting niche drugs for cancers and neurological diseases - expensive treatments for relatively small numbers of patients.</p> <p>\"We can expect drug research in large, well-served areas like pain relief to be reduced,\" said Marc Gerstein, a former consultant to US firms Eli Lilly and Pfizer. \"New drugs for niche conditions are likely to be fantastically expensive. In many cases, it will seem like blackmail. Without government assistance or insurance, treatment will simply not be affordable for many.\" </p> <p>The outcome of the US election could have a significant impact. Senator Barack Obama wants Medicare to negotiate directly with companies to drive down drug prices that are on average twice as high as those in Britain.</p> <p>The industry has also been hit by large-scale public health scares. In his recent book Flirting with Disaster: Why Accidents Are Rarely Accidental, Gerstein analyses US drugmaker Merck's Vioxx disaster - the painkiller had to be withdrawn in 2004 after causing thousands of heart attacks and strokes.</p> <p>\"Could this happen in the UK?\" he asked. \"The odds seem lower than in the US, but the pressures to enhance drug marketing and co-opt the regulators are ever present. There is a lot of money at stake.\"</p> <p>In Britain, GSK had to issue new safety warnings after its diabetes drug Avandia was linked with an increased risk of heart attacks last year.</p> <p>As blockbusters become rarer, drugmakers such as GSK have switched their focus to developing a range of \"middle earners\" with annual revenues of \u00a3200-300m. Witty declared in July: \"GSK must change if it is to be successful in the future.\" There is a new focus on vaccines - which are hard to copy - and household brands like Ribena, Horlicks and Lucozade. </p> <p><strong>Biologics and generics</strong></p> <p>Companies are also investing heavily in developing biological medicines, which can often be used to treat several conditions and are harder to replicate than conventional chemical drugs. Roche offered more than $40bn to take full control of US biotech partner Genentech in July.

  "<p>After much hoopla, this iconic and global brand name has finally made it to London although, in the end, you wonder what all the fuss was about. Perched under the north side of Waterloo Bridge, the vast, hacienda-like interior is certainly diverting. A bar mezzanine area overlooks the warmly lit dining room, which is marked by an imposing Buddha statue and enormous chandeliers on which you half expect Zorro to swing. It's the mediocre and astronomically priced pan-Asian cooking - starters \u00a34.50-\u00a323.50, mains \u00a314.50-\u00a369 - and limited drinks, with the exception of wines, that provide the disappointment. The assortment of sushi and sashimi dishes for instance, is far inferior to what's available in any number of places in London alone. That said, highlights on the \u00e0 la carte menu include juicy seared scallops with shitake mushrooms and a lovely coconut satay, tender roasted black cod with yuzu miso sauce, and an excellent Korean marinated beef. </p> <p> \u2022 8 Victoria Embankment, WC2 (Tel: 020-3371 7777 ) price per head \u00a350</p>",
  "<p>This Eric Bainbridge retrospective is titled Forward Thinking 1976-2008, signalling the artist's determination not to be trapped in any kind of retrogressive tendency. Yet the achievement is historically impressive. This is mischievously subversive sculpture in an environment of consumer waste and workaday banality. Bainbridge's materials might be purchased from the bucket shop and the DIY store, yet his structures are immaculately formed. It's far from the art of an untrained outsider. The outcome is delightfully unnerving. This looks like furniture that should be of some use but which can only uplift the spirit from the inkling of a possible disillusionment. </p> <p> \u2022 Institute Of Modern Art, to Nov 16</p>",
  "<p>Nobody ever said on their deathbed that they wished they'd spent more time at the office. It's an old gag turning into a new reality: full-time, white-collar workers are spending even less time in the office - and when we're in the office, even less time shackled to the same few square metres of an assigned workstation by our fixed telephone extension and dedicated computer, whose cables snake into an underfloor spaghetti junction that roots us to that spot and that spot only.</p> <p>With the wireless-networked Generation Y \"millennials\" setting the pace, we are all now mobile; it's just that some offices haven't yet realised it. But the smart office is here, and, according to the giants of office design and equipment, those who hold out against ever-smarter thinking in the white-collar workplace will not only be technologically, environmentally and socially out of date, but severely out of pocket.</p> <p>An independent survey (undertaken on behalf of the international architecture and interior design firm Gensler) of UK knowledge-based office workers across a range of activities, from banking to marketing, has identified a huge efficiency gap in the average British office. Companies in the UK, on average, productively use just 55% of their office space; in London's key business districts alone, that's \u00a310.5bn wasted each year. Two thirds of UK employees are \"unhappy\" with their current workspace, and staff productivity could be improved by 21% if their workplaces were better designed, equivalent to \u00a3145bn of annual output for the UK's service sector.</p> <p>Following the post-war proliferation of cheap and cheerless office buildings, our white-collar workplaces are perhaps the least-loved in Europe. But thanks to the surge of prestigious new office building developments to mark London as the world's financial capital, all this is changing for the better, according to Gary Wheeler, Gensler's European director of workspace. </p> <p>\"Socialisation at work has become much more important,\" he says. \"The water-cooler used to be looked at negatively. Not any more. It's where you go to find people you trust to exchange knowledge. Cafes are the knowledge marketplace. Head-down work amounts to about half your time in the office, and it is shrinking compared to collaboration, which is growing, especially as more women enter the workplace who want sharing, validation and feedback.\"</p> <p>Nor is Gensler alone in seizing the moment to shape the space where we spend so many of our waking hours.</p> <p>Strasbourg is the site of Gutenberg's original printing press and is a hotbed of revolutionary office technology - namely WorkLab, the European research facility and showcase of the world's largest office furniture manufacturer and workspace designer, Steelcase.</p> <p>It calls the site a campus, and with reason. This playful, airy and friendly site sets a mood of convivial exploration and experiment rather than clock-punching graft. No one has an assigned workstation, yet meeting spaces of all shapes, sizes and degrees of informality abound; their \"yurts\" and \"dyadic slices\" look like they should be occupied by waifs modelling vintage Cardin and Courr\u00e8ges. The buzz-concepts governing Steelcase's macro- and micro-designs on our working environment are collaborative work, mobile work, broad social networks and four-generation workforce: welcome, in short, to Wikiworld. Yet the Steelcase client list, from \"big oil\" and \"big software\" down, demonstrates this is no mutated survival from the 90s dotcom bubble but the prototype of how millions will work tomorrow.</p> <p>And that isn't all. Environmental soundness lies at the heart of Steelcase's work. The US multinational scrutinises its products and suppliers down to the molecular level for environmental sustainability. With sales rising as corporate customers strive for a greener image, Steelcase's entwined environmental and telecommunications strategies are also cutting energy, travel and floorspace costs. The result is higher profits.</p> <p>London-based PR giant Edelman has rushed to embrace the revolution in office design. Gensler's brief was to design an HQ that would both help integrate three separate workforces under one roof and quickly adapt to the firm's fluctuating workload and headcount through hotdesking. It had to be \"exciting and engaging\" for staff, explains deputy CEO Susan Eastoe. \"It has to create the right impression for clients: classy, elegant and trustworthy.\" </p> <p>Inside, a bistro, bar, library, glass walls and skylights, couches and soft furnishings foster \"transparency, socialising and collaboration. Everybody went 'Wow!' when they walked in, which really lifted morale. People walk around, talk, bounce ideas and work creatively for the client.\"</p> <p>The revolution is reaching even into unglamorous public sector poor relations such as the Driver and Vehicle-Licensing Agency, which has redesigned its Swansea HQ as part of a strategy to raise staff morale, increase efficiency and save money through rationalising space. Sociable \"break-out spaces\" throughout and \"non-territorial working\" is its version of the hotdesking concept. The DVLA has four desks per five staff members, and the system is flexible enough to move with the business. </p> <p>How has it all gone down with the staff? \"At the outset there was a lot of concern,\" admits Jeremy Morgan, who runs the DVLA refurbishment process. \"But we could make a good financial and environmental case, and as people got used to the new way of working, enthusiasm has snowballed.\"</p> <p>And with Steelcase's UK and Benelux managing director, Mark Spragg, forecasting that despite the current downturn in the economy, the UK private and public sector combined will spend over \u00a335bn on the development and the refurbishment of their office spaces in the next year, chances are the snowball is heading your way. </p> <h2>How our workspaces will change</h2> <p><strong>Collaborative spaces</strong><br>From the casual sofa by the water-cooler to the wireless, multi-screen \"war room\" with video and web conferencing, instant messaging and interactive whiteboards and easy-wipe walls for spontaneous, paperless brainstorming. Flexible mind-meeting places will move from the periphery to the heart of office design.</p> <p><strong>Mobile workstations</strong><br>Updating unreserved hotdesking, with \"hotelling\" you reserve the space and facilities you need, with your firm's IT and phone system clicking automatically into place and your personal items following you round in a lockable file pedestal on wheels. Next-generation office furniture is easily interlockable to create working spaces for open teamwork or privacy, with chairs that adjust and flex to fit your movements and promote alertness or relaxation at will.</p> <p><strong>Social networking</strong><br>With studies showing different age-groups in the multi-generational workforce less inclined to collaborate across age gaps, office design will seek to break down barriers through attractive open-planning.</p> <p><strong>BlueSpace</strong><br>A Steelcase-IBM joint development venture combining office furniture and microprocessors that can automatically tailor the space, shape, function, privacy, ambient sound and light of your personal and group working environment. For instance, concealed ceiling sub-woofers emit frequencies that mask distracting background chat, while lighting can mimic the sun's arc, so keeping your body clock ticking in natural sync.</p>",
  "<p>There he goes again. John McCain went out and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.johnmccain1\">found himself a vice-presidential candidate</a> today, but as is often his way, he made sure that political gain was his master, while potential to lead this nation during troubled times was placed on the back burner.</p> <p>And he accuses Barack Obama of \"not putting his country first\"? </p> <p>McCain's choice was governor Sarah Palin of Alaska, a former mayor of a town the size of the building where I grew up in New York. More recently, she has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/29/johnmccain.uselections2008\">performing her gubernatorial duties</a> for an entire 1.5 years since her election in November of 2006. In other words, compared to her, when it comes to foreign policy experience, Obama is practically Napoleon.</p> <p>Meanwhile, she is what you might call a bit slow on the uptake. When asked on CNBC's talkshow Kudlow &amp; Co about some of the vice-presidential speculation surrounding her only a month ago, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0808/12969.html\">Palin's reaction</a> really speaks for itself:</p> <p>\"But as for that VP talk all the time, I'll tell ya, I still can't answer that question until somebody answers for me, what is it exactly that the VP does every day?\"</p> <p>Perhaps the vice-president, unlike Palin, might spend part of their day worrying about what to do about global warming rather than denying it, as she has.</p> <p>Making matters worse, Palin is currently <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/2008/08/29/palin-corruption-investigation/\">under investigation</a> for pressuring Alaska's former public safety commissioner, Walt Monegan, to fire her former brother-in-law Mike Wooten from his job as a state trooper. Her sister was embroiled in a nasty divorce with Wooten, and when Monegan didn't investigate, he was fired from his job. Palin denied any involvement at first, yet has since <a href=\"http://www.adn.com/monegan/story/492964.html\">admitted that staff members contacted Monegan</a> about this matter. But she, of course, new nothing about it.</p> <p>The Alaska legislature, apparently filled with sentient beings, took that denial as seriously as you probably just did, and decided to <a href=\"http://www.adn.com/monegan/story/494556.html\">hire an independent investigator</a>.</p> <p>It is clear why McCain made this choice. He is hoping to win over still-angry Hillary Clinton supporters and other independent women, although when these women become aware of the fact that she believes abortion should be outlawed, voted for \u00fcber-right-wing commentator Pat Buchanan for president in 2000 and recently called senator Clinton a \"whiner\", well, many women may conclude that she just doesn't quite speak for them. </p> <p>They might also worry, like the rest of us, about a female Dan Quayle being a heartbeat away from the presidency. John McCain just turned 72 today (happy birthday senator!) and has had skin cancer.</p> <p>In the end, this is one more example of the real John McCain. He was against tax cuts for the wealthy before he was for them. He was against offshore oil drilling before he was for it. And he was against \"risking\" putting someone as untested as Obama in the White House, until he chose to put someone with the experience of Dudley Moore in the West Wing.</p>",
  "<p>Nearly lost amid the political hoopla of two presidential nominating conventions is a sombre milestone. Friday was the <a href=\"http://www.nola.com/katrina/\">third anniversary of Hurricane Katrina's deadly strike</a> on the Gulf of Mexico coast, a catastrophe that nearly destroyed New Orleans and, with its aftermath of botched rescue efforts, has done more than anything but the Iraq war to discredit the Bush presidency. </p> <p>As if following some kind of karmic timetable, though, <a href=\"http://news.google.co.uk/news/url?sa=t&amp;ct=us/0-0-0&amp;fp=48bb0bb37a8a36e1&amp;ei=V3y7SNP0LqXYQaOEkdAC&amp;url=http%3A//www.cnn.com/2008/US/weather/09/01/gustav/&amp;cid=1241029694&amp;usg=AFQjCNG_4Ho6ft6iv__jXUzSomDa6MiPfA\"> Tropical Storm Gustav gathered strength</a> over the Caribbean and entered the Gulf. Forecasts indicate it will head toward Louisiana, meaning a possible deadly blow for New Orleans. The machinery of mass evacuations has cranked into motion across the Gulf coast. Fema and other federal agencies, having learned some lessons with Katrina, are <a href=\"http://www.thenewsstar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080828/UPDATES01/80828061\">pre-positioning aid and personnel</a>.</p> <p>And Republicans, whose convention to nominate John McCain for the presidency gets underway on Monday in St Paul, Minnesota, are panicking. White House officials say <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/2008/08/28/bush-gustav-rnc/\">President Bush may opt out of his planned Monday speech</a>, and there's talk of <a href=\"http://blogs.usatoday.com/ondeadline/2008/08/mccain-camp-gop.html\">postponing the convention altogether</a>. The potential spectacle of Republicans partying and launching political attacks on Barack Obama while a storm rains destruction on American communities would indeed hurt McCain's chances. It would seem callous - a Republican weakness to begin with - but also evoke images of the Katrina aftermath, when the Bush administration spent more time pinning blame on Democrats than on rescuing citizens trapped in flooded New Orleans.</p> <p>The fact that Republicans are concerned almost wholly with how things look, not the actual threat of the storm to life and property, isn't surprising. The fact is, America's leaders - Republican and Democrat - never really learned the lessons of Katrina. </p> <p>Katrina represented a failure of the government at all levels - not just in emergency management, but in the basic idea of government itself, protecting citizens from harm. In the decades before the storm hit, the US government embarked on an ambitious plan to protect New Orleans and its surrounding suburbs from hurricane storm surges. It managed to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/27/hurricanekatrina.usa\">totally botch the job</a>. Not only was the new levee system a patchwork, full of gaps and shoddy construction, some floodwalls were built using faulty designs and fell down soon after the water rose. </p> <p>Moreover, as scientists learned more about hurricanes, it was clear by the 1980s that New Orleans would be destroyed if a hurricane hit it head-on, as floodwaters swamped its levees and filled the city like a soup bowl. Every summer, as new hurricanes roared over Gulf waters, the US played a game of hurricane roulette with one of its major cities. Yet nothing was done to address this mortal threat. Meanwhile, the city itself and its surrounding marshes were sinking into the sea, steadily opening it to greater risks.</p> <p>New Orleans is an excellent proxy for the broader challenges posed by global warming, which will mean rising seas and (probably) bigger, more dangerous storms. The deltaic landscape of south Louisiana is changing very fast, so the risks from storms and flooding are rising faster than flat-footed, special interest-dominated American institutions are able to handle. In the coming decades, there will be more New Orleanses in America and elsewhere around the world. </p> <p>Katrina provided an early warning, offering some valuable lessons on how to handle climate change. Protecting New Orleans from future storms would mean not only preserving a US city and a valuable cultural heritage. It would force institutions to reform and devise smarter policies that could be adapted to the coming challenges.<br> But New Orleans proved too politically marginal to get much attention from Washington, and protecting and rebuilding it - which ought to be a national priority - soon became a tertiary concern. The result: The levee system is being upgraded, at a cost of $13bn. But the upgrades only protect against relatively weak storms. We're still playing hurricane roulette.</p> <p>Forecasters say <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/weather/08/29/gustav/index.html\">Gustav will strengthen</a> to a Category 4 storm, with wind speeds between 131-155 mph (210-249 km/hr), and would easily overwhelm the levees if it comes close enough to the city. That could undo the past three years of rebuilding, and destroy what Katrina missed.</p> <p>This is bad for New Orleans, of course. I am sceptical, given that the institutions charged with protecting it are so weak and slow-moving, that the city will still be there a century from now. But more ominously still, this shows how fundamentally unready the US government is to tackle the coming challenges of climate change.</p>",

  "<p>This summer's misery for energy consumers continued today when the last two of the big six suppliers raised prices for millions of households.</p> <p>Scottish Power, which has just over 5 million customers, said its gas bills would rise by 34% from the beginning of next month while electricity customers would see a 9% rise in prices. Npower said it was putting up its gas prices by 26% and electricity by 14% for its 6.6 million customers with immediate effect.</p> <p>The latest increases come amid growing calls for a windfall tax on energy companies to help the increasing numbers of households struggling to cope with rising bills at a time when food and fuel costs are also increasing.</p> <p>Today, a coalition of Age Concern, Child Poverty Action Group and National Energy Action increased the pressure on the government by demanding measures to make social tariffs for energy fairer and more effective.<br>The coalition warned that 5.5 million households were likely to face fuel poverty - defined as spending more than 10% of income on heating and lighting - this winter.</p> <p>Age Concern responded sharply to the latest increases. The director general, Gordon Lishman, said: \"Many pensioners, already worrying about whether they can afford to heat their homes this winter, will be outraged by news of yet more colossal price hikes. It is a huge worry that one in three pensioner households are likely to be living in fuel poverty by the end of 2008 and many are already feeling forced to cut back on essential food or fuel.\"</p> <p>Tim Wolfenden, the head of home services at the comparison website uSwitch.com, said: \"The industry-wide shift to higher household energy prices is now complete. All the major suppliers have increased prices for a second time this year \u2013 this is a heavy blow and few households will emerge unscathed or unconcerned about the future affordability of their energy. </p> <p>The government is expected to respond within the next few days, although it remains unclear how any further help will be funded. An extra \u00a3225m from companies for social programmes for poorer customers over the next three years was announced earlier this year, but the companies now face demands to go further. </p> <p>The government is said to be wary of slapping a windfall tax on the sector at a time when the industry is facing the challenge of stumping up more than \u00a3100bn to invest in more renewable methods of power generation and the replacement of ageing nuclear power plants and coal-fired stations that will have to close under European legislation.</p> <p>One suggestion is that the government may seek to increase the proportion of permits to emit carbon dioxide that firms are forced to buy under the European Union's emissions trading scheme from the current 7% to 10% - a move opposed by power generators who use fossil fuel. </p> <p>Earlier this summer, EDF Energy, British Gas, E.ON and Scottish and Southern Energy all raised their prices. The latest round of increases is the second by the big six this year. It takes the average household bill on standard plans for gas and electricity combined to between \u00a31,200 and more than \u00a31,300, depending on the supplier, according to uSwitch.com. At the beginning of the year, dual fuel bills with all six were well below \u00a31,000.</p> <p>The companies blame the rising cost of wholesale gas and power prices for the increases for residential customers. Gas prices are linked to oil prices because of the UK's increasing dependence on imports from continental Europe, where gas contracts are often indexed to the price of oil. International coal prices have also risen sharply.</p> <p>Today, ScottishPower, which is owned by Spain's Iberdrola, said coal prices had risen by 45% since February, while wholesale gas prices had climbed 65% and electricity by 55% over the same period. By contrast, it said, its own prices for dual fuel users would rise on average of 25%.</p> <p>Willie MacDiarmid, Scottish Power's director of energy retail, said: \"These are difficult times and we understand the financial impact this announcement will have on our customers. Although we're one of the last companies to announce increases we're sorry we couldn't hold on any longer. However we have worked very hard to protect people for as long as possible from these considerable increases in the wholesale market.\"</p> <p>Giuseppe Di Vita, the npower managing director, said the decision had been taken \"extremely reluctantly, especially as household budgets are being squeezed so much at the moment.\"</p>",
  "<p>To some they are a rural escape in the centre of the city, to others they are a chance to test their green fingers and design skills. Now <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/audio/2008/aug/29/climatechange.boris\">London mayor Boris Johnson</a> has found a new use for urban roof gardens \u2013 as a key weapon on the frontline against global warming.</p> <p>An increase in the number of rooftop gardens to soak up rainwater across the capital is among a series of measures suggested by Johnson today, as part of efforts to prepare London for the effects of climate change.</p> <p>The mayor's adaptation strategy, billed as a world-first, aims to address the challenges of flooding, extreme temperatures and drought. It calls for compulsory water metering, greater awareness of flood risks, and more tree planting, alongside stronger efforts to resist attempts by local authorities and insurance companies to fell existing urban trees. </p> <p>The mayor's team said they were also looking to copy a heatwave emergency plan used in US cities including Philadelphia, where old and vulnerable people are collected in air-conditioned buses and taken to cool public buildings. They said libraries, shopping centres, churches and offices across the city could be used.</p> <p>Johnson, who has previously dismissed the Kyoto Protocol, which regulates international carbon emissions, as \"pointless\" and said anxiety over climate change was \"partly a religious phenomenon\" said the <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/independent_reviews/stern_review_economics_climate_change/stern_review_Report.cfm\">2006 Stern Review </a>which investigated the issue had convinced him of the need to act. \"When the facts change, you change your mind,\" he said.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/29/climatechange.water\">Launching the strategy at the Thames barrier</a>, he said: \"We need to concentrate efforts to slash carbon emissions and become more energy efficient in order to prevent dangerous climate change. But we also need to prepare for how our climate is expected to change in the future. The strategy outlines in detail the range of weather conditions facing London, which could both seriously threaten our quality of life, particularly that of the most vulnerable people, and endanger our pre-eminence as one of the world's leading cities.\" </p> <p>He said all major cities were at risk from climate change, and that the strategy, which is a legal requirement under the Greater London Authority Act, put London in a strong position. \"London is not unique. All major cities such as New York and Tokyo are at risk from climate change.\"</p> <p>The strategy does not address so-called mitigation of climate change, measures to reduce emissions, but Johnson said he supported a target set by previous mayor Ken Livingstone to slash carbon pollution 60% by 2025. He said measures to meet the target would include incentives for Londoners to better insulate their homes and switch to more efficient condensing boilers. His team is assessing whether households could be given council tax rebates for adopting such energy-saving measures.</p> <p>Global warming is expected to give London and its surrounding area longer, hotter summers as well as warmer, wetter winters with the added problems of more frequent heat waves, droughts and flash floods from rising sea levels and downpours. Some 600 Londoners died as a result of the 2003 heat wave that killed about 15,000 in France, while low rainfall during 2004 and 2005 led to water shortages in the capital. </p> <p>Some 15% of London is deemed at high risk from flooding due to global warming \u2013 an area including 1.25 million people, almost half a million properties, more than 400 schools, 75 underground and railway stations, 10 hospitals and London City airport. At stake is an estimated \u00a3160bn worth of assets, not just in London, but along the banks of the Thames estuary, where large housing developments are planned.</p> <p>Johnson said work was under way to address stifling summertime temperatures on the underground network, with air cooling on sub-surface tube lines to begin in 2010. By 2015, he said all trains on subsurface lines, around 35-40% of the network, will be air cooled.</p> <p>The draft adaptation strategy, which will be finalised next year, calls for a citywide 'urban greening' programme, using green spaces and trees to absorb and retain rainwater, and pledges to map London's drainage network to reduce surface water flood risk. It also recommends greater use of rainwater harvesting and \"grey water\" recycling in new buildings, as well as London-specific guidance for designers and architects to reduce the risk of buildings overheating in summer.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/29/boris.climatechange\">Jenny Bates of Friends of the Earth</a> said: \"It is essential that the capital prepares for the impacts of climate change, which is already affecting Londoners through increased flood risk, heavier and more frequent downpours and extreme heat. </p> <p>\"But Boris Johnson is also committed to cutting London's carbon dioxide emissions by 60% by 2025 in order to prevent dangerous climate change, and has so far failed to explain how he will achieve this. The mayor must provide a comprehensive action plan for reducing London's emissions that includes ways to make it cheaper and easier for Londoners to go green.\"</p>",
  "<p>A panel of MPs today called for a radical overhaul of the \"outdated\" benefits system for unpaid carers and urged the government to provide extra financial help to support them. </p> <p>The Commons work and pensions select committee said that people who cared for relatives and friends saved the taxpayer an estimated \u00a387bn every year.</p> <p>Their support was of \"critical importance\" to the government and they ought to receive more assistance, the committee said. </p> <p>The committee's latest report, Valuing and Supporting Carers, recommends income replacement for those who have to work part-time or are unable to work because of their commitments, and compensation for the extra costs incurred from providing \"intensive\" caring roles. </p> <p>The MPs say they were \"disappointed\" the government had not directly addressed financial help for carers in its Carers Strategy and that the group were only identified as a long-term priority from 2011. </p> <p>Carers struggled to remain in work because of a lack of affordable, reliable and flexible care services and they often suffered \"opportunity penalties\", finding their vocational skills became rusty and out of date. </p> <p>The committee's report said: \"We believe that the current system of benefits for carers is outdated and we recommend the introduction of two distinctive 'tiers' of support for carers, offering income replacement support for carers unable to work, or working only part-time, and compensation for the additional costs of caring for all carers in intensive caring roles.\" </p> <p>Labour MP Terry Rooney, who chairs the committee, said: \"The DWP needs to provide adequate financial support for those who provide care when of working age, either by compensating them for the extra costs of caring, or, if they need to give up work to care, through adequate income replacement and pension protection mechanisms.\" </p> <p>Citizens' Advice welfare policy officer Vicky Pearlman, who gave evidence to the committee, welcomed the report's recommendations. </p> <p>She said: \"The current system is enormously complicated, and even DWP staff struggle to correctly identify, and clearly explain, the benefits that carers and their families are entitled to.\" </p> <p>She added: \"It is crucial that the government takes action to boost carers' incomes as a matter of urgency. </p> <p>\"If the government is serious about reaching an 80% employment rate and empowering people to work, it needs to look seriously at how it can remove the barriers that make it very difficult for carers, especially those on means-tested benefits, to engage in the labour market.\" </p> <p>Anne McGuire, the minister for disabled people, said that the government valued the contribution carers made to their families, friends, neighbours and communities. </p> <p>She said the government had put in an extra \u00a3255m to support carers as part of its Carers Strategy, launched earlier this year. </p> <p>McGuire said: \"This includes \u00a3150m over two years so that carers can take short breaks, over \u00a36m to support young carers and up to \u00a338m to help them to enter or re-enter the job market. </p> <p>\"We are working with employers to ensure that carers can have a better balance between their work and caring responsibilities. The government is committed to reviewing the care and support system as part of the longer term welfare reform programme. </p> <p>\"We welcome this report, which is a valuable contribution to the debate. We will study the recommendations and respond to them in due course.\" </p> <p>Campaign groups welcomed the report and challenged the government to improve the package available to carers. </p> <p>Imelda Redmond, chief executive of Carers UK, said the cross-party report echoed the views of carers. </p> <p>She said: \"We argued for improvements to benefits as part of the government's Carers Strategy and were bitterly disappointed when none were included. </p> <p>\"As well as being insultingly low at just \u00a350.55 per week, carer's allowance does not recognise carers' individual circumstances and discourages them from combining caring with paid work. The two-tier benefit recommended by the committee would be a major improvement to the current system. Carers need a separate benefit which recognises that they are not unemployed but are making an important contribution to society.\"</p> <p>Paul Cann, a spokesman for Help the Aged, said that the growing funding gap in the care system needed to be addressed.</p> <p>He said: \"The committee's excellent report lays bare the extent to which carers struggle to access the support they need while carrying out one of the most valuable jobs in our society. Carers save our health and social care systems billions of pounds and they deserve a better deal in return.\"<br> \"We are delighted that the committee has recognised the potential of care vouchers and we look forward to working with the government and the DWP to implement the committee's recommendation.\" </p> <p>Graeme Betts and Caroline Marsh of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services said: \"At the very least, the report's conclusions and recommendations should be at the forefront of the current thinking that's going into the green papers on both welfare reform and on social care funding for adult services.\"</p>",
  "<p>I'm asking myself when the honeymoon period for the new mayor will be over, and when Londoners can be expected to see real progress rather than lots of erudite chatter and vague promises. This administration seems to lack any sense of urgency about the terrifying issue of <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7587465.stm\">climate change</a>, preferring instead to tackle the issue of drinking on the tube (when was that a problem?) and cutting as much as they can from the GLA budget without first understanding what valuable work, and where, was being done.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/29/climatechange.water\">mayor's adaptation strategy</a>, launched today, is about how London will cope with the changes to its climate from carbon emissions that have already been produced and are already doing damage. I welcome its arrival and look forward to the companion piece, the mitigation strategy, later this year. Having the adaptation strategy does not mean you accept future emissions, just that you are preparing to deal with already unavoidable climate changes due to emissions produced so far. The mitigation strategy is about how to reduce our future emissions and our burden on the rest of the planet.</p> <p>However, this adaptation strategy is largely the same as that prepared under the previous, much-maligned administration. All the ideas are sound, all are component parts of resisting the inevitable encroachment of climate change, with its floods and shortages, but the crucial part is understanding when and how it will be delivered.</p> <p>Therefore, Greens are now calling for strong and timely action from the mayor. A litmus test would be support for speedy delivery of the <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/auu/green-grid.jsp\">East London Green Grid</a>, a massive project that has mapped all the green areas in the Thames Gateway and seeks to protect them for food growing space, leisure space and flood defences. It will mean that the future development of that area, with its houses, shops and businesses, will be better to live in, work in and visit. It's an excellent and necessary scheme for the health of us all, delivered by Design for London, which Johnson has wound up. So in spite of all his fine words so far on the environment, will projects like the Green Grid, nurtured by the previous mayor, be thrown out because he doesn't really get the environment?</p> <p>Please, enough very amusing chat, just get on with the job.</p>",
  "<p>Energy firms npower and Scottish Power have become the last of the big six energy firms to raise their gas and electricity prices.</p> <p>Scottish Power plans to raise electricity prices by 9% and gas prices from Monday by a massive 34%, while npower has announced immediate plans to raise electricity prices by 14% and gas prices by 26%.</p> <p>Npower was the first to make its announcement, increasing the average bill by \u00a3162 a year for gas and \u00a360 for electricity.</p> <p>The average dual fuel bill for an npower customer has now risen from \u00a31,056 to \u00a31278 - an increase of \u00a3222. However, customers have seen a total rise of 41% or \u00a3370 since the start of the year.</p> <p>Scottish Power then became the last of the big six providers to raise its tariffs for the second time this year. Its average dual fuel bill has now increased from \u00a31,040 to \u00a31,299.</p> <p>Like all the other providers it blamed the price hikes on increases in wholesale gas and coal prices.</p> <p>Scottish Power's director of retail energy, Willie MacDiarmid, apologised for the increases but said the firm \"couldn't hold on any longer.\"</p> <p>\"We have tried hard to keep electricity prices as low as possible and our increase of 9% is the lowest in the sector,\" he said. \"The continuing volatility in the global market for gas is directly contributing to increasing the UK's domestic energy prices and Scottish Power is not immune to these rises.\"</p> <p>It's been a record-breaking year for energy prices in a single year with average price rises of 38%. This eclisped 2006 when average prices rose by 32%.</p> <p>Last week, both Scottish and Southern and E.ON <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/aug/21/energy.householdbills1\">raised their gas and electricity prices</a> by up to 29.2% and 19.2% respectively.</p> <p>At the end of July, British Gas announced what was thought to be the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/jul/30/householdbills.familyfinance\">biggest ever rise in gas prices</a> by a UK firm after it announced a 35% hike in energy prices. </p> <p>All these rises were sparked by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/jul/26/householdbills.consumeraffairs\">EDF raising its gas prices</a> by 22% and electricity prices by 17%.</p> <p>Director of campaigns at utilities watchdog Energywatch, Adam Scorer, said it expected the government to shortly announce a raft of measures to protect the most vulnerable consumers.</p> <p>But he warned: \"Action is long overdue. Token gestures will achieve little. Six price rises from the 'big six' in just five weeks caps a miserable summer for consumers and highlights just how the companies appear to act in step with each other, even if not in concert.\"</p> <p>He continued: \"The market clearly needs urgent reform.

  "<p>Weather and economics aside, it's been a golden summer for Britain. It's also been a golden summer for <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/7571360.stm\">Manchester</a>. </p> <p>Even though I support the blue side of Manchester's football heritage, I don't really mind that wherever I go in the world it's not Manchester City that starts the conversation. \"Ah, yes, Manchester United,\" is the response when I say where I come from. It's commonplace everywhere - in Europe, Africa, Asia and even the US.</p> <p>I'm not a fan of the club but I can appreciate the importance to the city of having such a powerful and huge global brand, which helps puts Manchester on the map.</p> <p>But Manchester's place in global sport is now about much more than football. Team GB's success at the Beijing Olympics can, in part, be said to have been made in Manchester. For example, all the cycling medal winners trained at Manchester's velodrome, the National Cycling Centre.</p> <p>Sorry to make a political point out of the success of a team of athletes and coaches who have all worked incredibly hard to win medals at this year's Olympics. But the world-class sporting facilities that Manchester hosts \u2013 for cycling and swimming as well as football \u2013 aren't there by chance. The velodrome and the aquatics centre, both recent hosts of their respective world championships, are part of the legacy of the Commonwealth Games of 2002.</p> <p>It's not just the political determination to win and host the Commonwealth Games that we should grateful for, but also the political leadership that ensured sustainable world-class facilities there to serve future generations and the wider community. Bidding for such events is not without controversy \u2013 they cost a lot of money and don't always result in long-term benefits \u2013 and it's often not until many years later that the true value is realised. Given that politicians are often accused of thinking in the short-term, it makes it even more laudable that we ever manage to win such things.</p> <p>Both the velodrome and the Commonwealth swimming pool are open to the public and are frequently used by local schools and the local community. Over the last six years young people have been inspired to take up swimming and cycling more seriously; some of them are now coming through as Olympic champions or hopefuls.</p> <p>This is the lasting legacy of Manchester's Commonwealth Games, a legacy that might not have turned out that way (as many other host cities found). We should thank Manchester's political leadership for their vision all those years ago that helped bring so much national pride during this otherwise gloomy and rainy summer.</p> <p>The other political decision that helped Team GB's success this year is, of course, the massive increases to sports funding over the last decade or so.</p> <p>Funding for sports (and the arts) are often the first things facing the chop in difficult times. Let's hope that the focus of London 2012 and the amazing medal tally of Beijing keep the funding levels necessary for future British glory.</p>",

  "<p>On August 23 1995, a buddy and I were among a sparse crowd watching the New York Mets play the visiting San Francisco Giants at Shea Stadium. My friend's father had secured us a pair of field level seats, right behind home plate where the players' relatives get their tickets, and we spent the warm summer afternoon sitting behind the wily little cousins of Mets outfielder Ryan Thompson.</p> <p>In the bottom of the ninth inning, the Giants had a 3-2 edge. With New York down to their final out, Chris Jones hit a Terry Mulholland pitch off the right field foul pole - it was a game-tying home run ... or so I, and 18,811 other fans thought. First-base umpire Gary Darling saw it differently, ruling the ball foul and ordering Jones back to the batters box to continue the at-bat. Despite the protest of Mets manager Dallas Green, the game carried on and Chris Jones struck out swinging on the very next pitch, ending the ball game prematurely, at least according to the suddenly rowdy crowd. Disgusted fans threw various items on to the field, while one of Thompson's cousins went straight for the source, flinging what was left of his orange soda down on to the umpires as they entered the tunnel. The fans had indeed seen it correctly: the following morning, the New York Times headline read \"Video Screen Isn't Lying: Mets Robbed of Homer\".</p> <p>Had that play happened on Thursday, Gary Darling's disputed call would have likely been overruled. That is because the umpire crew would have been able to walk over to a television screen, watch a series of replays and, using video evidence, make the right call. In more than 130 years of Major League Baseball, it has been entirely up to the men in blue to make snap decisions. Now, at least on what are being called \"boundary calls\", the umps will have help in making sure that they make the right decisions. According to mlb.com, \"instant replay can determine disputed home run calls - fair or foul, in or out of the ballpark, fan interference\", while \"MLB games will be monitored and staffed by an expert technician and either an umpire supervisor or a former umpire at MLB Advanced Media headquarters in New York.\"</p> <p>In baseball land, this is a big deal. Recently, MLB has been on the cutting edge in the way it promotes its product; it was the first North American League to make games available on the internet. A few years before that, it put radio broadcasts of the games online. When it comes to on-field rules however, baseball's wheels turn slower. The brass on Park Avenue had little interest in instant replay while the NFL (1986), NHL (1991) and NBA (2002) all went forward with it, adapting television review technology in various forms. Baseball's GMs voted to explore the use of limited instant replay on disputed home runs back in November, but there was not a peep until the umps blew a series of calls in May. It's just a few months later, and commissioner Bud Selig, finally seeing the light, has ushered in baseball's instant replay era.</p> <p>Personally, I'm conflicted about it. On one hand, it makes perfect sense to do everything possible to get the calls right, especially in the playoffs. If you play 162 regular season games and get to a big spot in the post-season, you don't want to see games decided by a fan sticking his hands into the field of play, as infamously took place in Game One of the 1996 American League Championship Series, when Yankees fan Jeffrey Maier reached out and helped Derek Jeter's fly ball over the fence. In that case, the outfield umpire was actually in a decent position to see what happened and still blew the call. In the regular season there are no outfield umpires, making such calls even more difficult. On the other hand, the purist in me admired how baseball, unlike other sports, was willing to live with the imperfections of umpires, keeping the game's decision-making process in human hands.</p> <p>In the end, I can live with it. However, what I don't agree with is this furious rush to get instant replay going this season. It's not that I doubt the technology, having seen it at work inside mlb.com's New York headquarters, but it seems logical to start instant replay in 2009 rather than today. First off, there is something fundamentally wrong with playing a single season under two sets of rules. Secondly, with only five weeks to go in the regular season, there is a chance, however slight, that the system could see its first real test in the playoffs. By starting it next season, there are six months of baseball during which instant replay could be called upon to settle a disputed boundary call, allowing the system to be put to the test in a less stressful atmosphere.</p> <p>So far, those who have come out against instant replay include Chicago Cubs manager Lou Piniella, who cites the possibility of extended delays and the chance of a \"little bit of a fiasco\". Most of the Mets, who have lost two homers to incorrect calls this season, are in support of the initiative, as are the Philadelphia Phillies. The Tigers players seem split on the idea, while the Tampa Bay Rays are indifferent to the new review policy. Most players and managers agree that instant replay probably shouldn't go beyond disputed home run calls. How smoothly the experiment goes will have a lot to do with whether or not it stays; the Players Association has until December 10 to negotiate an extension of the policy. If they don't exercise that right, instant replay will stick around at least until the end of the labor agreement between owners and players in 2011.</p> <p>Now we wait to see instant replay in action; it could be tomorrow, in three weeks, deep in October or maybe next season. In what could be considered a knee-jerk reaction to a few bad calls early this year, Bud Selig put instant replay on the fast track - should the system fail in the post-season, on baseball's brightest stage, all eyes will focus firmly on the commissioners' box.</p>",
  "<p>After 20 years of waiting, UK academics are buzzing with excitement after researchers at Cern in Switzerland made a successful trial run of the world's most powerful particle accelerator.</p> <p>Last Friday scientists at Cern steered a single bunch of particles through 3km of the <a href=\"http://lhc.web.cern.ch/lhc/\">Large Hadron Collider</a> (LHC), a 27km ring of huge electromagnets that straddles the Swiss-French border 100m underground. The stage is now set for the first attempt to send a beam of particles around the full ring on September 10; the event will be broadcast around the world on the internet and will be the final preparation for what has been dubbed \"the world's biggest science experiment\" \u2013 colliding two beams of particles travelling in opposite directions at 0.999999991 times the speed of light. Researchers hope to uncover some of the universe's unsolved mysteries, proving the existence of elusive types of subatomic particle such as the Higgs boson (the particle is thought to give everything else in the universe mass).</p> <p>But what does the work at Cern mean for physics in the UK?</p> <p>Prof Mike Green, of Royal Holloway, chairs the committee that publicises the LHC in Britain, and is excited to see its knock-on effects over here.</p> <p>\"Certainly for the particle physicists, it's the biggest project of everyone's career,\" he said, \"but more than every other project, the rest of the physics community knows what's going on too. They're aware that something big is happening.\"</p> <p>Some 600 of the particle physicists in the UK, around two thirds, are involved in the Cern project. With more than 80 countries taking part, never has there been a single project that has involved so many nations and industries than the LHC.</p> <p>With this communal spirit, it seems that the common scramble for research paper credits will be minimal once results start appearing. Each experiment at the LHC will be overseen by \"collaborations\" made up of all the experts involved in its preparation \u2013 the largest has more than 2,000 \u2013 and the data will be accessible to anyone within that collaborative group. While academics are free to go away and analyse the results, their findings must be peer-reviewed by the entire group before being published.</p> <p>One individual who may well encounter personal glory is <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/jun/30/higgs.boson.cern\">Prof Peter Higgs</a>, whose name has been given to the particle most believe the LHC will find. Many tip him for a joint Nobel prize if the particle is proved to exist.</p> <p>Dr Tara Shears of the University of Liverpool, also working on the project, says that if the particle is discovered, the push for a Nobel prize will be big. A prize to Higgs, though, would have to somehow acknowledge the numerous other scientists who are devoting much of their careers to testing his theory; Dr. Shears points out that fine-tuning and testing a model is as much a feat as thinking it up. However, that's still a long way off. \"We're too concerned with getting the machine up and running to think about that,\" she says.</p> <p>The project is not, however, just drawing attention from academia or even from inside the world of physics. Interest has come from other academics and undergraduates from other disciplines. School physics teachers have also visited the LHC, sometimes with their class in tow. Until recently it was possible to see the giant instrument's workings from the inside. </p> <p>The Campaign for Science and Engineering in the UK, which lobbies for state and private support for scientific endeavours, is excited about the attention. Director Nick Dusic believes that such exposure could spark renewed public interest in physics.</p> <p>\"It's an incredibly important experiment,\" he said, \"and hopefully we can demonstrate its relevance in the UK and worldwide.\" Wide coverage of the experiment's progress could encourage more spending in the industry, too; the government accounts for just 29% of spending on civil research and development, the rest coming from businesses and private donations and from abroad.</p> <p>Eventually, such global attention could spawn a new generation of physicists. For Manchester University's Prof Brian Cox, another British academic involved with the project, it is this, not the knowledge obtained, that would be the most important result of the experiment.</p> <p>\"The technological spin-offs - to me they're an aside. A project like this is inspiring, and that's what encourages young people. That's what encouraged me. People go into it because it's exciting and cutting edge, and you need almost no argument except that. The biggest benefit of the moon landings was the new generation of scientists that they inspired.\"</p> <p>These \"technological spin-offs\", of course, are still of great use in themselves. Working on something like the LHC provides engineers and physicists with skills that nobody else in the world has: many of the cryogenic experts responsible for cooling the entire system to -271C (-456F) - creating as they go \"the world's largest fridge\" - have already moved on to work at the <a href=\"http://www.iter.org\">ITER</a> fusion reactor project in France, which is hoping to solve the world's energy needs. And Dr Shears points out that yesterday's particle detectors have made today's PET scanners, which aid cancer treatment, while CERN's computer network is a feat of technology in itself, prepared at it is to handle 15 million gigabytes of data per year. </p> <p>Even so, the overriding enthusiasm is not about technical and technological improvements, but the tangible idea of discovering something new.</p> <p>\"It's the most exciting physics experiment for decades,\" said Prof. Cox. \"It's a leap into the dark in a way that no particle accelerator has been before. We're at the limit of our capabilities \u2013 the closest thing I think we've done is gone to the moon.\"</p> <p>It is this prospect of gaining a new understanding of how the universe works which is ultimately the biggest draw for physicists. As Dr Green says: \"The unknown is always very exciting for physicists. Put it this way; we'll be surprised if there isn't a surprise.\"</p> <p>Either way, after 20 years, there isn't long left to find out.</p>",
  "<p>To a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. To <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bj\u00f8rn_Lomborg\">Bjorn Lomborg</a>, every problem is reducible to a cost benefit analysis. At the end of it a number emerges \u2013 if it is positive, there is a benefit, if it is negative, there is a cost. Faced with a choice of policy options, all we have to do is to carry out a cost benefit analysis of the alternatives, and go with the biggest number. All other considerations are extraneous. </p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/27/climatechange.scienceofclimatechange\">Lomborg</a>'s world, the numbers he plays with take on a godlike role as representations of Platonic truths. But they are, of course, no such thing. Reality is complex and tangled \u2013 so your model has to be a highly simplified before it is even computable. Numerous assumptions must be made, and fudge factors applied. All of these inevitably reflect the values of the modeller. And so do the numbers that emerge at the end of the exercise. </p> <p>For example, Lomborg's analysis of climate change impacts is entirely indifferent as to who wins and who loses. All that matters is the sum of gains and losses. This automatically places a far higher value on the interests of rich countries, where assets are valuable and incomes are high, than on those of poor countries, where assets are cheap and incomes low. </p> <p>It would thus be a benefit to increase the gross product of the USA ($14tn) by 1% \u2013 a gain of $140bn \u2013 while halving the combined gross products of Nigeria ($200bn) and Bangladesh ($70bn) \u2013 a loss of $135bn. A small increment in the incomes of 300 million mainly rich people outweighs a collapse in the incomes of 300 million mainly poor people. </p> <p>And then how do you put a price on <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2002/03/23/t1_86.php\">Venice</a>? On the life of a child? On the biodiversity of all those ecosystems and species at risk from climate change, from coral reefs to tropical forests, from penguins to polar bears? For the sake of simplicity many economists simply ignore the issue. And so the invaluable becomes without value. </p> <p>Economic methods also systematically undervalue the future. Typically economists value a gain a year hence as worth a few percent less than the same gain right now. Applied over a longer time span, this makes a gain worth taking today if balanced by a loss 10 times greater in a century's time, or by a loss 10,000 times greater after four centuries. The Lomborgian oracle speaks: profit now, even at the risk of ruinous catastrophe a few hundred years' hence. </p> <p>This may explain why Lomborg's discussion of sea-level rise stops at 2100, at which time the IPCC conservatively projects a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2006/mar/24/science.climatechange\">sea-level rise</a> of under 0.6m. Potential sea-level rises of tens of metres by 2300 simply don't matter, as the costs, however huge, can be discounted to the point of irrelevance. Just as the disastrous losses of the world's poorest billion people under the regime of drought, flood, storm and famine predicted by the IPCC is as nothing to a small increment in the wealth of the richest billion. </p> <p>Not that I disagree with Lomborg about everything. He proposes a tenfold increase in expenditure on energy R&amp;D, which he has argued <a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/channel/opinion/mg19626272.200-interview-an-inconvenient-voice.html\">elsewhere</a>, should be financed by a global $2 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/nov/17/climatechange.carbonemissions\">carbon tax</a>, raising some $50 billion. This is a perfectly sensible suggestion, and indeed financing for energy R&amp;D on this scale forms part of the package of measures proposed in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Kyoto2-How-Manage-Global-Greenhouse/dp/1848130252\">Kyoto2</a>.</p> <p>But this alone is an insufficient response. Clean energy sources need to be deployed as well as developed, and especially in <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/08/11/business/energy.php\">poor countries</a> that will otherwise commit to fossil fuel based economies. Experience shows that R&amp;D spending will produce some wonderful new technologies, but it is only with mass production that they will become commercially competitive against fossil fuels. This deployment phase will require additional spending in poor countries many times greater than the initial R&amp;D cost, and will need to be stimulated in the developed world by a long-term carbon cap. </p> <p>The global carbon market, or a carbon tax as proposed by Lomborg, is the obvious place to look for the funds to finance our clean energy revolution. We also we need to help poor people, and poor countries, adapt to the climate change to which the Earth is already committed, to the tune of $100 billion per year. The same goes for programmes to preserve forests, maintain peatlands and sequester carbon into soils \u2013 essential measures to buffer continuing emissions from fossil fuels, increase the biosphere's resilience in the face of climate change, and conserve biodiversity. </p> <p>Lomborg already supports one component of the Kyoto2 package. If he considers it with an open mind, further points of agreement may yet emerge. But first he needs recognise that economics is not a pure, value-free science. Economic models reflect the values of their creators. If an economic model tells us that it is correct to risk extinguishing much of the world's life, and perhaps the human species in the process, it is not because life is uncompetitive \u2013 the fault is in the economics.</p>",

  "<p>Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, it has seemed that new rules were being established for the conduct of international relations in central and eastern Europe and central Asia. The watchwords were independence and interdependence; sovereignty and mutual responsibility; cooperation and common interests. They are good words that need to be defended. </p> <p>The Georgia crisis provided <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/29/russia.georgia\">a rude awakening</a>. The sight of Russian tanks in a neighbouring country on the 40th anniversary of the crushing of the Prague Spring has shown that the temptations of power politics remain. The old sores and divisions fester. Russia remains unreconciled to the new map of Europe. </p> <p>Yesterday's unilateral attempt to redraw the map marks not just the end of the post-cold war period, but is also the moment when countries are required to set out where they stand on the significant issues of nationhood and international law. </p> <p>The Russian president says he is not afraid of a <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article4622422.ece\">new cold war</a>. We don't want one. He has a big responsibility not to start one. </p> <p><a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7585527.stm\">Ukraine</a> is a leading example of the benefits that accrue when a country takes charge of its own destiny, and seeks alliances with other countries. </p> <p>Its choices should not be seen as a threat to Russia or an act of hostility. Equally its independence does demand a new relationship with Russia \u2013 a partnership of equals, not the relationship of master and servant. </p> <p>Russia must not learn the wrong lessons from the Georgia crisis: there can be no going back on fundamental principles of territorial integrity, democratic governance and international law. It has shown in the last two weeks what anyone could have foretold: that it can defeat Georgia's army. But today Russia is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/28/russia.nato\">more isolated</a>, less trusted and less respected than two weeks ago. It has made military gains in the short term. But over time it will feel the economic and political losses. If Russia truly wants respect and influence, and the benefits that flow from it, Russia needs to change course. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/29/russia.georgia\"> Prime Minister Putin</a> has described the collapse of the Soviet Union as \"the greatest geopolitical catastrophe\" of <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4480745.stm\">the 20th century</a>. I don't see it that way. Most people of the former Soviet bloc or Warsaw Pact don't see it that way. It will be a tragedy for Russia if it spends the next 20 years believing it to be the case. </p> <p>Indeed, since 1991 there has been no \"stab in the back\" of Russia. In fact, we have offered Russia extensive cooperation with the EU and Nato; membership of the council of Europe and the G8. Summits, mechanisms and meetings have been developed by the EU and Nato not to humiliate or threaten Russia, but to engage with it. The EU and the United States provided critical support for the Russian economy when it was needed, and western companies have invested heavily. And Russia has made substantial gains from its reintegration into the global economy. </p> <p>These are actions that seek to promote prosperity and respect for Russia. But they have recently been met with scorn. Indeed, the record from suspension of Russian participation in the conventional armed forces to harassment of business people and cyber attacks on neighbours is not a good one. Now we have Georgia. </p> <p>People often talk and ask about unity in Europe. Russian action has produced unity in Europe. Unity in demanding the withdrawal of Russian troops to their August 7 positions; unity in rejecting the use of force as the basis for redrawing the map of the Caucasus; unity in support of the democratically elected government of Georgia. </p> <p>Of course Russia can and should have interests in its neighbours, but like everyone else, it must earn that influence. Indeed, they do not make up the \"post-Soviet space\" to which Prime Minister Putin often refers. The collapse of the Soviet Union created a new reality \u2013 sovereign, independent countries with minds of their own and rights to defend. </p> <p>Russia also needs to clarify its attitude to the use of force to solve disputes. Some argue that Russia has done nothing not previously done by Nato in Kosovo in 1999. But this comparison does not bear serious examination. </p> <p>Leave to one side that Russia spends a lot of time arguing in the UN and elsewhere against \"interference\" in internal affairs, whether in Zimbabwe or Burma. Nato's actions in Kosovo followed dramatic and systematic abuse of human rights, culminating in ethnic cleansing on a scale not seen in Europe since the second world war. Nato acted over Kosovo only after intensive negotiations in the UN security council and determined efforts at peace talks. Special envoys were sent to warn Milosevic in person of the consequences of his actions. None of this can be said for Russia's use of force in Georgia. </p> <p>The decision to recognise Kosovo's independence came only after Russia made clear it would veto the deal proposed by the UN secretary general's special envoy, former Finnish President Ahtisaari. Even then we agreed to a further four months of negotiations by an EU-US-Russia troika in order to ensure that no stone was left unturned in the search for a mutually acceptable compromise. </p> <p>Over Georgia, Russia moved from support for territorial integrity to breaking up the country in three weeks and relied entirely on military force to do so. </p> <p>Russia must now ask itself about the relationship between short-term military victories and long-term economic prosperity. At the time of the Soviet Union's invasion of Hungary in 1956 or Czechoslovakia in 1968, no one asked what impact its actions had on the Russian stock market. There was no Russian stock market. </p> <p>Now, the conflict in Georgia has been associated with a sharp decline in investor confidence. Russia's foreign exchange reserves fell in one week by $16bn. In one day the value of Gazprom fell by the same amount. Risk premia in Russia have sky-rocketed. </p> <p>Isolation of Russia is not feasible. It would be counter-productive because Russia's economic integration is the best discipline on its politics. It would only strengthen the sense of victimhood that fuels intolerant nationalism. And it would compromise the world's interests in tackling nuclear proliferation, addressing climate change or stabilising Afghanistan. </p> <p>But the international community is not impotent. Europeans need Russian gas, but Gazprom needs European consumers and investment. The reality of interdependence is that both sides have leverage; both sides can change the terms of trade. </p> <p>Our approach must be hard-headed-engagement. That means bolstering allies, rebalancing the energy relationship with Russia, defending the rules of international institutions, and renewing efforts to tackle \"unresolved conflicts\". </p> <p>Here, Ukraine is key. It has strong links to Russia and this is firmly in both countries' interests. But Ukraine is also a European country. Ukrainian leaders have spoken of their aspiration to see their country become a member of the EU. Article 49 of the EU treaty gives all European countries the right to apply. The prospect and reality of EU membership has been a force for stability, prosperity and democracy across eastern Europe and it should remain so beyond. Once Ukraine fulfils EU criteria, it should be accepted as a full member. </p> <p>As for Ukraine's <a href=\"http://www.independent.ie/opinion/letters/ukraines-nato-bid-may-backfire-1465334.html\">relationship with Nato</a>, it does not pose a threat to Russia. It is about strengthening Ukraine's democratic institutions and independence \u2013 things that will benefit Russia in the long term. </p> <p>Europe also must re-balance the energy relationship with Russia. Europe needs to invest in storing gas to deal with interruptions. More interconnections between countries and properly functioning internal markets will increase resilience. It needs diverse, secure and resilient gas supplies. </p> <p>Europe needs to act as one when dealing with third parties like Russia. And we will be reducing our dependence on gas altogether: increasing energy efficiency, investing in carbon capture and storage technology for coal, and in renewables and nuclear power. </p> <p>In all international institutions, we will need to review our relations with Russia. I do not apologise for rejecting kneejerk calls for Russia to be <a href=\"http://www.opendemocracy.net/russia/article/should-russia-be-expelled-from-G8\">expelled from the G8</a>, or for EU-Russia or Nato-Russia relations to be broken. But we do need to examine the nature, depth and breadth of relations with Russia. </p> <p>In Nato, we will stand by our commitments to existing members, and there will be renewed determination that there should be no Russian veto on the future direction of Nato. </p> <p>Fourth, the unresolved conflicts that mark the end of empire should not be ignored. The world's attention is currently on South Ossetia and Abkhazia. But the conflicts in Transnistria and Nagorno-Karabakh must <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/28/georgia.russia \">not be overlooked</a>. Each has its roots in longstanding ethnic tensions, exacerbated by economic and political underdevelopment. </p> <p>The choice today is clear. Not to sponsor a new cold war, but to be clear about the foundations of lasting peace.</p> <p>In cooperation with <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org/\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2008.</p>",
  "<p>Headteachers in the UK are among the highest paid in the world and England's approach to developing school leadership one of the best globally, according to an international study.</p> <p>However, schools around the world are in danger of being overburdened by bureaucracy and the demands of testing, and will struggle to find headteachers as a result, found the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)'s <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/edu/schoolleadership\">school leadership study</a>.</p> <p>Headteachers in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland were found to be the best paid school leaders compared to per capita GDP.</p> <p>School leaders' earnings grew by 19% in real terms between 1997 and 2003 compared with the overall average earnings of public and private sector workers (12%), the report found.</p> <p>Researchers recommend this fact be used to make the profession more attractive.</p> <p>The report, published yesterday, praised headteacher training and leadership development in England from the <a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org.uk/\">National College for School Leadership</a> (NSCL) as having a \"positive impact on education\".</p> <p>But, while the report paints a healthy picture of UK teaching in general, it says government reforms in England have increased headteachers' responsibilities and duties, making their role \"much more demanding and challenging\".</p> <p>This includes greater accountability to parents and communities, dealing with policy initiatives and preparing for school inspections as well as the burden school league tables place on schools, which have a negative impact, the OECD research found.</p> <p>All 22 of the education systems in Europe, Australia and New Zealand that were examined in the study face shortages of headteachers.</p> <p>\"In many countries, principals have heavy workloads; many are reaching retirement and it is getting harder to replace them. Potential candidates often hesitate to apply, because of overburdened roles, insufficient preparation and training, limited career prospects and inadequate support and rewards,\" the research found.</p> <p>This is more of a problem for small and primary schools, where absence of senior staff, limited administrative assistance and an overburdened role - often combining full time teaching with managerial tasks - call for special support, it added.</p> <p>According to the report, school leadership is now a priority in education agendas worldwide and plays a key role in improving pupil attainment, by influencing and motivating teachers as well as the school climate and wider environment.</p> <p>Over the past few years the nature of school leadership in England has changed. Some now employ a team of leaders to take on different roles within the school \u2013 \"distributed leadership\" \u2013 while heads can be found running several schools, often in federations and trusts.</p> <p>But the report says school leaders in general need more time and support to focus on ways of improving learning further.</p> <p>They also need more professional development to cope with broadened roles and responsibilities expected of them.</p> <p>In-service training should be offered periodically to principals and leadership teams so they can update their skills and keep up with new developments, the report suggests.</p> <p>Steve Munby, chief executive of NSCL, said: \"Over the past eight years NCSL has worked long and hard with headteachers and other school leaders across England to raise the bar for everyone by providing specialist training through targeted programmes \u2026 through ongoing advice and support such as at regional stakeholder meetings countrywide and online forums.</p> <p>\"However, we aren't complacent and have to continue working hard to ensure we inspire leaders and improve children's lives.\"</p> <p>On the headteachers shortage, Munby anticipates that up to 55% of UK heads will retire by 2012, but this is in stark contrast to the problems being experienced by Korea, which has 99% of its heads aged over 50, Belgium (81%) and Denmark (76%).</p>",

  "<h2><a name=\"mccain\">On John McCain</a></h2> <p>Now let there be no doubt. The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect. And next week, we'll also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need.</p> <p>But the record's clear: John McCain has voted with George Bush 90% of the time. Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than 90% of the time? I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a 10% chance on change.</p> <p>The truth is, on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives - on healthcare and education and the economy - Senator McCain has been anything but independent. He said that our economy has made \"great progress\" under this president. He said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong. And when one of his chief advisers - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a \"mental recession,\" and that we've become, and I quote, \"a nation of whiners\".</p> <p>A nation of whiners? Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made. Tell that to the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty. These are not whiners. They work hard and give back and keep going without complaint. These are the Americans that I know.</p> <p>Now, I don't believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of Americans. I just think he doesn't know. Why else would he define middle class as someone making under $5m a year? How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than 100 million Americans? How else could he offer a healthcare plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatise social security and gamble your retirement?</p> <p>It's not because John McCain doesn't care. It's because John McCain doesn't get it.</p> <p>For over two decades, he's subscribed to that old, discredited Republican philosophy - give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else. In Washington, they call this the ownership society, but what it really means is - you're on your own. Out of work? Tough luck. No healthcare? The market will fix it. Born into poverty? Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps - even if you don't have boots. You're on your own.</p> <p>Well it's time for them to own their failure. It's time for us to change America.</p> <h2><a name=\"foreignpolicy\">On foreign policy</a></h2> <p>If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament, and judgment, to serve as the next commander-in-chief, that's a debate I'm ready to have.</p> <p>For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face. When John McCain said we could just \"muddle through\" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights. John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the gates of hell - but he won't even go to the cave where he lives.</p> <p>And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government, and even the Bush administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79bn surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.</p> <p>That's not the judgment we need. That won't keep America safe. We need a president who can face the threats of the future, not keep grasping at the ideas of the past.</p> <p>You don't defeat a terrorist network that operates in 80 countries by occupying Iraq. You don't protect Israel and deter Iran just by talking tough in Washington. You can't truly stand up for Georgia when you've strained our oldest alliances. If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice - but it is not the change we need.</p> <p>We are the party of Roosevelt. We are the party of Kennedy. So don't tell me that Democrats won't defend this country. Don't tell me that Democrats won't keep us safe. The Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans - Democrats and Republicans - have built, and we are here to restore that legacy.</p> <p>As commander-in-chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home.</p> <p>I will end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al-Qaida and the Taliban in Afghanistan. I will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts. But I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression. I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and disease. And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future.</p> <h2><a name=\"economy\">On the economy</a></h2> <p>We Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country.</p> <p>We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma. We measure progress in the 23m new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was president - when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush.</p> <p>We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honours the dignity of work.</p> <p>The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight.</p> <h2><a name=\"taxes\">On taxes</a></h2> <p>Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it.</p> <p>Unlike John McCain, I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America.</p> <p>I will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start-ups that will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow.</p> <p>I will cut taxes - cut taxes - for 95% of all working families. Because in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class.</p> <h2>On fuel</h2> <p>For the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as president: in 10 years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East.</p> <p>Washington's been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years, and John McCain has been there for 26 of them. In that time, he's said no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars, no to investments in renewable energy, no to renewable fuels. And today, we import triple the amount of oil as the day that Senator McCain took office.</p> <p>Now is the time to end this addiction, and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution. Not even close.</p> <p>As president, I will tap our natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power. I'll help our auto companies retool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in America. I'll make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars. And I'll invest $150bn over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy - wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and 5m new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced.</p> <h2><a name=\"education\">On education</a></h2> <p>Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy. Michelle and I are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education. And I will not settle for an America where some kids don't have that chance. I'll invest in early childhood education. I'll recruit an army of new teachers, and pay them higher salaries and give them more support. And in exchange, I'll ask for higher standards and more accountability. And we will keep our promise to every young American - if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education.</p> <h2><a name=\"healthcare\">On healthcare</a></h2> <p>Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible healthcare for every single American. If you have healthcare, my plan will lower your premiums. If you don't, you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves. And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most.</p> <p>Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent.</p> <h2><a name=\"pensions\">On pensions</a></h2> <p>Now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws, so that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses; and the time to protect social security for future generations.</p> <h2><a name=\"abortion\">On abortion</a></h2> <p>We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country.</p> <h2>On gun control</h2> <p>The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me we can't uphold the second amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals.</p> <h2>On same-sex marriages</h2> <p>I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination.</p> <h2>On immigration</h2> <p>Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers. This too is part of America's promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort.</p> <h2>On individual responsibility</h2> <p>We must also admit that fulfilling America's promise will require more than just money. It will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what John F Kennedy called our \"intellectual and moral strength\". Yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient. Yes, we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair. But we must also admit that programmes alone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need.</p> <p>Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility - that's the essence of America's promise.</p> <h2>On equal pay</h2> <p>And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons.</p> <h2><a name=\"patriotism\">On patriotism</a></h2> <p>What I will not do is suggest that the senator [McCain] takes his positions for political purposes. Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism.</p> <p>The times are too serious, the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook. So let us agree that patriotism has no party. I love this country, and so do you, and so does John McCain. The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents, but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag. They have not served a Red America or a Blue America - they have served the United States of America.</p> <p>So I've got news for you, John McCain. We all put our country first.</p> <h2><a name=\"background\">On his background</a></h2> <p>In the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbour, marched in Patton's army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill.</p> <p>In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mum, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships.</p> <p>When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the south side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed.</p> <p>And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman. She's the one who taught me about hard work. She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life. She poured everything she had into me. And although she can no longer travel, I know that she's watching tonight, and that tonight is her night as well.</p> <p>I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine. These are my heroes. Theirs are the stories that shaped me. And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the United States.</p> <h2>On change</h2> <p>I realise that I am not the likeliest candidate for this office. I don't fit the typical pedigree, and I haven't spent my career in the halls of Washington.</p> <p>But I stand before you tonight because all across America something is stirring. What the naysayers don't understand is that this election has never been about me. It's been about you.</p> <p>For 18 long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the politics of the past. You understand that in this election, the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result. You have shown what history teaches us - that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washington. Change comes to Washington. Change happens because the American people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time.</p> <p>America, this is one of those moments.</p> <h2>On the American spirit</h2> <p>This country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich. We have the most powerful military on Earth, but that's not what makes us strong. Our universities and our culture are the envy of the world, but that's not what keeps the world coming to our shores.</p> <p>Instead, it is that American spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend.</p>",
  "<p>The stereotypical image of a school bully as tough and self-confident needs revising, according to research that found the vast majority of bullies are victims themselves.</p> <p>A study conducted by researchers at the Institute of Education in London found that less than 1% of primary school children are \"true bullies\" \u2013 those who are not bullied by their peers.<br>Researchers found that bullies are more likely than their classmates to suffer from low self-esteem, depression, and behavioural problems from early childhood and through primary school. They are more likely to suffer from mental health problems later in life too.</p> <p>The government-funded study, carried out by the Centre for Research on the Wider Benefits of Learning (WBL), looked at data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a study of children born in the former Avon Health Authority between April 1 1991 and December 31 1992. </p> <p>Focusing on information collected from 6,500 eight- to 11-year-olds, researchers found that 5% of children were bullies, but only 0.5% were \"true\" bullies, while 4.5% were bullied themselves.</p> <p>The majority (74%) of bullies were found to be boys, who suffered the highest levels of depression, anger, paranoia, emotional disaffection and suicidal behaviour, and disliked school the most.</p> <p>The researchers argued that this absence of \"true\" bullies could be down to the social environment of primary schools, where children have less tolerance for power imbalances. They suggest that more of these bullies could be found in secondary schools, not examined in the study, as social arrangements are more hierarchical and power balances less equal.</p> <p>The study acknowledged the work of peer-mentoring schemes already in place in schools to counter bullying, but suggested more long-term strategies in schools were needed, as older children who are bully/victims may have had emotional or behavioural problems from an early age. </p> <p>Dr Leslie Gutman, lead author of the study, said: \"We are not suggesting that schools should adopt a soft approach to bullying but simply stating that, on the basis of the evidence, bullying is a more complex issue than some people believe it to be.\"<br>She added: \"Early interventions that teach children coping strategies for developmental difficulties such as hyperactivity may also alleviate the later possibility of being targeted as victims and/or engaging in bullying.\"</p> <p>The study also revealed that being an only child or the youngest sibling had virtually no affect on children's bullying behaviour, although those from lower income families were more likely to be victimised, have few friends or regular fallouts, as, to a lesser extent, were those from ethnic minorities.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.learningbenefits.net/Publications/ResRepIntros/ResRep29intro.htm \">Read the full report here</a>.</p>",

  "<p>Climate change could seriously threaten quality of life in London and the capital's position as a leading world city, the mayor, Boris Johnson, warned today.</p> <p>Johnson issued the warning as he launched a strategy, claimed as the first for a major world city, detailing the action that needs to be taken in London to cope with global warming.</p> <p>It outlines measures such as \"greening\" the city and cutting water use, which will be needed to help London adapt to the higher risk of floods, droughts and heatwaves expected in the future.</p> <p>The strategy outlined the difficulties London faces in preparing to cope with the more frequent extreme weather events and the changes in the seasons \u2013 including warmer, wetter winters and hotter drier summers \u2013 that climate change will bring.</p> <p>Johnson believes London is well-placed to pioneer methods in adapting to climate change, suggesting there will be economic opportunities in developing \"green\" jobs in the city.</p> <p>Johnson said: \"We need to concentrate efforts to slash carbon emissions and become more energy efficient in order to prevent dangerous climate change. But we also need to prepare for how our climate is expected to change in the future.</p> <p>\"The strategy I am launching today outlines in detail the range of weather conditions facing London, which could both seriously threaten our quality of life \u2013 particularly that of the most vulnerable people \u2013 and endanger our pre-eminence as one of the world's leading cities.\"</p> <p>He said all major cities were at risk from climate change, and by producing the strategy \u2013 which is a legal requirement under the Greater London Authority Act \u2013 London was being put in a strong position.</p> <p>The strategy said the main dangers climate change poses the capital are flooding, drought and heatwaves.</p> <p>Some 1.25 million people are at risk of flooding, along with almost half a million properties, 441 schools, 75 underground and DLR stations and 10 hospitals under threat.</p> <p>The Thames region has lower water availability per person than Morocco, but Londoners consume on average 18 litres per day more than the national average while some 600m litres a day are lost through leaks.</p> <p>Summer temperatures in the capital have been rising in recent decades and the August 2003 heatwave killed at least 600 people in the city.</p> <p>The strategy outlines a series of measures to help the capital cope with the problems climate change is set to bring.</p> <p>They include:</p> <p>\u2022 \"Urban greening\", with the use and design of green spaces, green roofs and tree planting to absorb and retain rainwater <br>\u2022 Raising the public awareness of flood risk, and improve flood risk management on the Thames tributaries where properties are at significant risk of flooding<br>\u2022 Promoting less water loss by reducing leakage from water mains<br>\u2022 Encouraging people to use less water by promoting and aiding compulsory water metering in developments where feasible and retrofitting of existing homes to help them become more water efficient<br>\u2022 Designing new buildings and adapting old ones to minimise the need for cooling facilities.</p>",
  "<p>When proponents of a windfall tax, such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/28/energy.corporatesocialresponsibility\">Roy Hattersley</a>, talk about energy company profits, they should be clear about what they mean. It is true to say that the big global oil and gas producers such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bp\">BP</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/royaldutchshell\">Shell</a> are making record profits from high oil prices. These are mostly multinational companies operating across the world, they do not supply electricity or gas to domestic customers. </p> <p>Profits for residential gas and electricity suppliers are much lower. The way that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/centrica\">Centrica</a>, for example, has made nearly \u00a31bn in profit in the first half of the year is from its other businesses which include gas production in the North Sea and overseas operations \u2013 its household supply earnings fell 70%. </p> <p>It is wrong to say that suppliers gain these profits from the way energy tariffs are calculated. Gas and power suppliers must buy their fuel in world markets and are obliged to pay more for it because oil prices are so high and the gas market is linked to oil. Britain is now a net importer of gas and oil \u2013 our North Sea reserves are running low and output has slumped. </p> <p>We expect our companies to continue to provide a domestic supply whatever international energy prices are doing. While companies have increased residential tariffs substantially in recent weeks, they argue that they are trying to hold down household bills. The oil price has doubled this year but companies have raised prices by 35% at most. If they were out to make the most profit out of the business, they could truly reflect the international oil price.</p> <p>For example, many banks have effectively priced themselves out of the mortgage market because of the credit crunch and the difficulty they have in accessing funds. This has made sources of credit and home loans scarce.</p> <p>I think it is cavalier to ignore the threat to investment. Of course, business indulges in special pleading, what interest group doesn't? But whether we like it or not we are heavily dependent on large-scale investment by the energy industry in new generating capacity in the next 10 years, without which we will run out of power.</p> <p>Business requires a stable environment in which to plan long-term spending. Many homeowners would be quick to squeal if the government were to announce a tax on windfall profits from the sale of houses which have tripled in price in the past 10 years \u2013 in spite of the current downturn. A windfall tax is a kneejerk response to a short-term problem when funds could be raised in a much fairer and consistent way.</p>",
  "<p>Liverpool's plans for a new 60,000 capacity stadium in Stanley Park have been delayed yet again. The announcement, which came in a club statement today, is not unexpected as it has been feared for some time that American owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett were having trouble raising the funds for the \u00a3400m new ground, which will be built next to the current Anfield site on Stanley Park.</p> <p>When the Americans took over 18 months ago they immediately redesigned previous plans and had to allow for new planning permission. The current credit crunch is being blamed for the latest delay, even though enabling work has already started in and around Stanley Park.</p> <p>A statement on the club's official website said: \"Our commitment to building a new world-class Liverpool Football Club stadium is undiminished. Like many other major development projects in the UK and overseas we are affected by global market conditions and, as such, work on the project will be delayed in the short term. We will use this period productively and revisit the plans for the stadium to increase its capacity to 73,000 seats.\"</p> <p>Only yesterday it was revealed that EU grants to fund re-generation of the Anfield area had been withdrawn. The cash, around \u00a35m, is not a huge amount in the great scheme of things at Anfield, but it was a significant blow to the credibility of the Americans' plans.</p> <p>The money had been earmarked by the European Regional Development Fund for a community partnership centre as part of the new stadium. But the timescale involved meant the money had to be re-allocated last November and the stadium centre will now have to be fully funded by Liverpool.</p> <p>It is also believed that the club have yet to officially sign the lease from the council for the Stanley Park site, and contractors have also yet to sign formal agreements. It is now possible that north-west regional development grants may not be paid to the club. Meetings with Liverpool City Council recently also failed to confirm when building work would start.</p> <p>Today's announcement will only add fuel to the claims that Liverpool's owners are unable to fund the work, and re-ignite suggestions they may have to sell the club or consider a groundshare.</p> <p>Everton's planned move to Kirkby appeared dead in the water when the government called in the proposals. And in May this year Liverpool City Council leader Warren Bradley said he supported the idea of the two clubs sharing a ground. \"I've also been working behind the scenes on a joint Liverpool and Everton stadium,\" said Bradley. \"I've talked to the sports minister and to the Northwest Regional Development Agency and I've spoken to [Everton's chairman] Bill Kenwright.\"</p> <p>However, such a move would be highly unpopular with both sets of supporters.</p>",
  "<p>The end of that \"middle class fad\" \u2013 organic food \u2013 will be the cry from pundits feeding on reports of a decline in sales. But are the buyers of organic produce really that fickle? I think not. </p> <p>Firstly, it's worth remembering that we have had other recessions in the century-long history of the organic movement. Yet over this time, and especially in the past 20 years, there has been consistent growth, as people have come to see the flaws in the structure and practices of the global food industry.</p> <p>Yes, there has been the occasional plateau in growth. There have also been years of explosive expansion at other times, when BSE reared its head, for example, and as genetic engineering hits the headlines. These are times when society queries hard the \"advantages\" of cheap food, and the \"advantages\" of global agri-business strengthening its armlock over food supplies and producers.</p> <p>Despite this track record, could this economic downturn really be the end of the road for organic? As incomes tighten for a period, do people really revise their values and prioritise a new iPod, a pair of shoes, a smart car, over feeding their families better food? Very unlikely.</p> <p>Has the ethical consumer disappeared overnight \u2013 the same consumer that got so much media limelight just months ago? What nonsense. The ethical shopping market is now estimated at \u00a35.4bn, with 80% of us active in it, compared to just 20% a few years ago.</p> <p>Ethical shoppers are not just middle-class faddists. The assumptions that those on lower incomes just don't care about better food anymore, or the health of farm animals, or our environment, are hideously patronising.</p> <p>Organic food is such an easy target at times like this. It is often more expensive, in terms of the pound in your purse, in the industrialised world. But it is not so in developing nations, where organic-based techniques of soil care, crop rotation and natural fertility-building are often the most effective, safe, productive and resilient ways of producing nutritious food for the local population.</p> <p>Here, cheap oil and gas is the basis of the fertiliser and the big machinery agri-business relies on. That's the key reason conventional food seems so inexpensive (we spend, on average, only 10%-12% of our disposable income on food, the stuff of life!). </p> <p>The real cost is borne by the animals in their confinement, the environment in its degradation, and the population generally as the efficacy of antibiotics, for example, is potentially reduced due to their overuse to keep stressed animals healthy. Pretty expensive cheap food, you might think. And food that, while plentiful enough to keep most of us alive longer, appears to carry various other costs to our own health, such as obesity, malnutrition and heart disease.<br> You must also ask what happens if fossil fuels continue on their apparently inexorable rising cost curve? Organic food will start to look like a cost-effective option \u2013 it already uses 26% less energy on average. Even now the price gap between organic and conventional food is narrowing. Organic may even become a necessity, never mind a luxury. And there are plenty of options open to the organic shopper on a budget: direct from producers, seasonally bought, or using farmers markets, organic products can be cheaper already than conventional stuff bought in the main retailers.</p> <p>As a farmer myself, I am nervous about the confusions in the market place at the moment. A dismal summer, rising feed costs (for my pigs and dairy cows), endless promotions on retailers' shelves \u2013 it all means erratic sales. But our own experience is that people still want great quality and real provenance. I also believe that the day-to-day pleasures of eating wonderful food are even more enjoyable during more difficult economic times. </p> <p>We may see, and are seeing, some flattening of organic sales in the short term, but if as farmers we strive to achieve the highest standards in husbandry and quality and honesty, I believe that society will continue to buy into the fruits of our labour. Our customers are not as daft as some would make out.</p> <p>\u00b7 Helen Browning is food and farming director at the Soil Association and an organic farmer in north Wiltshire.</p>",
  "<p>ITV and RTL have still not agreed a final deal over when Dawn Airey will become Channel Five's chief executive - despite the broadcaster's owner announcing on Tuesday that she will start in October.</p> <p>In another twist in the battle over Airey, it appears ITV was caught on the back foot after the RTL Group chief executive, Gerhard Zeiler, announced on Tuesday that he expects her to start in October. </p> <p>Airey has been on gardening leave since it was announced she was stepping down as ITV's director of global content after eight months in May.</p> <p>Zeiler made the surprise announcement as RTL published its interim results earlier this week, telling journalists in a conference call: \"We are very happy that Dawn Airey will start at the end of October working for Five, and she will make a difference.\"</p> <p>However, two days after Zeiler's announcement, ITV is still unable to comment on Zeiler's announcement.</p> <p>MediaGuardian.co.uk understands that a combination of the fact that a deal still has to be signed off, plus some of the executives involved in the negotiations being away on holiday, has led to the silence from ITV.</p> <p>One source familiar with the situation said: \"Gerhard appears to have taken a bit of a punt talking about it before everything is finalised. However, both sides do now expect that Dawn will be released early.\"</p> <p>The ITV executive chairman, Michael Grade, was said to be furious at Airey's sudden departure and had threatened to hold her to 12 months' gardening leave - meaning she could not start at RTL until next May.</p> <p>But many observers believed that the longstanding relationship between ITV and RTL's production arm FremantleMedia, maker of hit ITV shows such as The X Factor and The Bill, would encourage the two sides to broker a compromise.</p> <p>One insider said there has been several months of heated \"sabre rattling\".</p> <p>Another source familiar with the situation added: \"It has been a battle, going back and forth between the two parties.\"</p> <p>It is thought that RTL may have offered to compensate ITV for allowing Airey to start before the end of her 12-month notice period.</p> <p>An RTL spokesman said: \"Gerhard said at the results this week that he expects Dawn to start in October. That is our only comment on this.\"</p> <p>Airey worked at Five as director of programmes and chief executive between 1996 and 2003.

  "<p>One of the greatest gifts of our democracy is the opportunity it offers us every four years to change course. It's not a guarantee; it's only an opportunity. The question facing us is, simply put, will we seize this opportunity for change? That's why I came here tonight: to tell you why I feel so strongly that we must seize this opportunity to elect Barack Obama president of the United States.</p> <p>Eight years ago, some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didn't really matter who became president. Our nation was enjoying peace and prosperity. Some assumed we would continue both, no matter the outcome. But here we all are in 2008, and I doubt anyone would argue now that election didn't matter.</p> <p>Take it from me, if it had ended differently, we would not be bogged down in Iraq, we would have pursued bin Laden until we captured him. We would not be facing a self-inflicted economic crisis; we would be fighting for middle-income families. We would not be showing contempt for the Constitution; we'd be protecting the rights of every American regardless of race, religion, disability, gender or sexual orientation. And we would not be denying the climate crisis; we'd be solving it.</p> <p>Today, we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000, though it may be even more obvious now, because John McCain, a man who has earned our respect on many levels, is now openly endorsing the policies of the Bush-Cheney White House and promising to actually continue them. The same policies all over again?</p> <p>Hey, I believe in recycling, but that's ridiculous. With John McCain's support, President Bush and Vice-President Cheney have led our nation into one calamity after another because of their indifference to fact; their readiness to sacrifice the long term to the short term, subordinate the general good to the benefit of the few and short-circuit the rule of law.</p> <p>If you like the Bush-Cheney approach, John McCain's your man. If you want change, then vote for Barack Obama and Joe Biden.</p> <p>Barack Obama is telling us exactly what he will do: launch a bold new economic plan to restore America's greatness; fight for smarter government that trusts the market, but protects us against its excesses; enact policies that are pro-choice, pro-education and pro-family, establish a foreign policy that is smart as well as strong; provide healthcare for all and solutions for the climate crisis.</p> <p>So why is this election so close? Well, I know something about close elections, so let me offer you my opinion. I believe this election is close today mainly because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change Barack Obama represents.</p> <p>There is no better example than the climate crisis. As I have said for many years throughout this land, we're borrowing money from China to buy oil from the Persian Gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilisation. Every bit of that has to change. Oil company profits have soared to record levels, gasoline prices have gone through the roof and we are more dependent than ever on dirty and dangerous fossil fuels.</p> <p>Many scientists predict that the entire north polar ice cap may be completely gone during summer months in the first term of the next president. Sea levels are rising, fires are raging, storms are stronger. Military experts warn us our national security is threatened by massive waves of climate refugees destabilizing countries around the world, and scientists tell us the very web of life is endangered by unprecedented extinctions.</p> <p>We are facing a planetary emergency which, if not solved, would exceed anything we've ever experienced in the history of humankind. In spite of John McCain's past record of open-mindedness on the climate crisis, he has apparently now allowed his party to browbeat him into abandoning his support of mandatory caps on global warming pollution.</p> <p>And it just so happens that the climate crisis is intertwined with the other two great challenges facing our nation: reviving our economy and strengthening our national security. The solutions to all three require us to end our dependence on carbon-based fuels.</p> <p>Instead of letting lobbyists and polluters control our destiny, we need to invest in American innovation. Almost 100 years ago, Thomas Edison said, \"I'd put my money on the sun and solar energy. What a source of power! I hope we don't have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that.\" We already have everything we need to use the sun, the wind, geothermal power, conservation and efficiency to solve the climate crisis - everything, that is, except a president who inspires us to believe: \"Yes we can.\"</p> <p>So how did this no-brainer become a brain-twister? Because the carbon fuels industry - big oil and coal - have a 50-year lease on the Republican party and they are drilling it for everything it's worth. And this same industry has spent a half a billion dollars this year alone trying to convince the public they are actually solving the problem, when they are in fact making it worse every single day.</p> <p>This administration and the special interests who control it lock, stock and barrel after barrel, have performed this same sleight-of-hand on issue after issue. Some of the best marketers have the worst products; and this is certainly true of today's Republican party. The party itself has on its rolls men and women of great quality. But the last eight years demonstrate that the special interests who have come to control the Republican party are so powerful that serving them and serving the national wellbeing are now irreconcilable choices.</p> <p>So what can we do about it? We can carry Barack Obama's message of hope and change to every family in America. And pledge that we will be there for Barack Obama - not only in the heat of this election, but in the aftermath as we put his agenda to work for our country.</p> <p>We can tell Republicans and Independents, as well as Democrats, why our nation needs a change from the approach of Bush, Cheney and McCain. After they wrecked our economy, it is time for a change. After they abandoned the search for the terrorists who attacked us and redeployed the troops to invade a nation that did not attack us, it's time for a change. After they abandoned the American principle first laid down by general George Washington, when he prohibited the torture of captives because it would bring, in his words, \"shame, disgrace and ruin\" to our nation, it's time for a change.</p> <p>When as many as three supreme court justices could be appointed in the first term of the next president, and John McCain promises to appoint more Scalias and Thomases and end a woman's right to choose, it's time for a change.</p> <p>Many people have been waiting for some sign that our country is ready for such change. How will we know when it's beginning to take hold? I think we might recognise it as a sign of such change, if we saw millions of young people getting involved for the first time in the political process. This election is actually not close at all among younger voters - you are responding in unprecedented numbers to Barack Obama's message of change and hope.</p> <p>You recognise that he represents a clean break from the politics of partisanship and bitter division. You understand that the politics of the past are exhausted, and you're tired of appeals based on fear. You know that America is capable of better than what you have seen in recent years. You are hungry for a new politics based on bipartisan respect for the ageless principles embodied in the United States Constitution.</p> <p>There are times in the history of our nation when our very way of life depends upon awakening to the challenge of a present danger, shaking off complacency to rise, clear-eyed and alert, to the necessity of embracing change.</p> <p>A century and a half ago, when America faced our greatest trial, the end of one era gave way to the birth of another. The candidate who emerged victorious in that election is now regarded by most historians as our greatest president. Before he entered the White House, Abraham Lincoln's experience in elective office consisted of eight years in his state legislature in Springfield, Illinois, and one term in Congress - during which he showed the courage and wisdom to oppose the invasion of another country that was popular when it started but later condemned by history.</p> <p>The experience Lincoln's supporters valued most in that race was his powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse. He was known chiefly as a clear thinker and a great orator, with a passion for justice and a determination to heal the deep divisions of our land. He insisted on reaching past partisan and regional divides to exalt our common humanity. In 2008, once again, we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning. And once again, we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition.</p> <p>Barack Obama had the experience and wisdom to oppose a popular war based on faulty premises. His leadership experience has given him a unique capacity to inspire hope, in the promise of the American dream of a boundless future. His experience has also given him genuine respect for different views and humility, in the face of complex realities that cannot be squeezed into the narrow compartments of ideology. His experience has taught him something that career politicians often overlook: that inconvenient truths must be acknowledged if we are to have wise governance.</p> <p>The extraordinary strength of his personal character - and that of his wonderful wife, Michelle - is grounded in the strengths of the American community. His vision and his voice represent the best of America. His life experience embodies the essence of our motto - e pluribus unum - out of many, one. That is the linking identity at the other end of all the hyphens that pervade our modern political culture. It is that common American identity \u2013 which Barack Obama exemplifies, heart and soul - that enables us as Americans to speak with moral authority to all of the peoples of the world, to inspire hope that we as human beings can transcend our limitations and to redeem the promise of human freedom.</p> <p>Late this evening, our convention will end with a benediction. As we bow in reverence, remember the words of the old proverb: \"when you pray, move your feet.\" Then let us leave here tonight and take the message of hope from Denver to every corner of our land, and do everything we can to serve our nation, our world - and most importantly, our children and their future - by electing Barack Obama President of the United States.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337065388\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1760479111_gdn-int-080829-cb-US-Obama-Speech-4x3.flv\"/> </video>   <p>To Chairman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin; and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation;</p> <p>With profound gratitude and great humility, I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.</p> <p>Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey, and especially the one who traveled the farthest - a champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours - Hillary Rodham Clinton. To President Clinton, who last night made the case for change as only he can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service; and to the next vice-president of the United States, Joe Biden, I thank you. I am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time, a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night.</p> <p>To the love of my life, our next first lady, Michelle Obama, and to Sasha and Malia - I love you so much, and I'm so proud of all of you.</p> <p>Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to.</p> <p>It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generationcan pursue their dreams as well.</p> <p>That's why I stand here tonight. Because for 232 years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women - students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors - found the courage to keep it alive.</p> <p>We meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil and the American promise has been threatened once more.</p> <p>Tonight, more Americans are out of work and more are working harder for less. More of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet. More of you have cars you can't afford to drive, credit card bills you can't afford to pay and tuition that's beyond your reach.</p> <p>These challenges are not all of government's making. But the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed policies of George W Bush.</p> <p>America, we are better than these last eight years. We are a better country than this.</p> <p>This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work.</p> <p>This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for 20 years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news.</p> <p>We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes.</p> <p>Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land - enough! This moment - this election - is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise alive. Because next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third. And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight. On November 4th, we must stand up and say: \"Eight is enough.\"</p> <p>Now let there be no doubt. The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect. And next week, we'll also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need.</p> <p>But the record's clear: John McCain has voted with George Bush 90% of the time. Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than 90% of the time? I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a 10% chance on change.</p> <p>The truth is, on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives - on healthcare and education and the economy - Senator McCain has been anything but independent. He said that our economy has made \"great progress\" under this president. He said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong. And when one of his chief advisers - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a \"mental recession,\" and that we've become, and I quote, \"a nation of whiners\".</p> <p>A nation of whiners? Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made. Tell that to the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty. These are not whiners. They work hard and give back and keep going without complaint. These are the Americans that I know.</p> <p>Now, I don't believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of Americans. I just think he doesn't know. Why else would he define middle class as someone making under $5m a year? How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million Americans? How else could he offer a healthcare plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatise social security and gamble your retirement?</p> <p>It's not because John McCain doesn't care. It's because John McCain doesn't get it.</p> <p>For over two decades, he's subscribed to that old, discredited Republican philosophy - give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else. In Washington, they call this the Ownership Society, but what it really means is - you're on your own. Out of work? Tough luck. No healthcare? The market will fix it. Born into poverty? Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps - even if you don't have boots. You're on your own.</p> <p>Well it's time for them to own their failure. It's time for us to change America.</p> <p>You see, we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country.</p> <p>We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma. We measure progress in the 23m new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was president - when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush.</p> <p>We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honors the dignity of work.</p> <p>The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight.</p> <p>Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill.</p> <p>In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships.</p> <p>When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the south side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed.</p> <p>And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman. She's the one who taught me about hard work. She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life. She poured everything she had into me. And although she can no longer travel, I know that she's watching tonight, and that tonight is her night as well.</p> <p>I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine. These are my heroes. Theirs are the stories that shaped me. And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the United States.</p> <p>What is that promise?</p> <p>It's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will, but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect.</p> <p>It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road.</p> <p>Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology.</p> <p>Our government should work for us, not against us. It should help us, not hurt us. It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every American who's willing to work.</p> <p>That's the promise of America - the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper.</p> <p>That's the promise we need to keep. That's the change we need right now. So let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if I am president.</p> <p>Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it.</p> <p>Unlike John McCain, I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America.</p> <p>I will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start-ups that will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow.</p> <p>I will cut taxes - cut taxes - for 95% of all working families. Because in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle-class.</p> <p>And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as president: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East.</p> <p>Washington's been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years, and John McCain has been there for 26 of them. In that time, he's said no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars, no to investments in renewable energy, no to renewable fuels. And today, we import triple the amount of oil as the day that Senator McCain took office.</p> <p>Now is the time to end this addiction, and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution. Not even close.</p> <p>As president, I will tap our natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power. I'll help our auto companies re-tool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in America. I'll make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars. And I'll invest $150bn dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy - wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and 5m new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced.</p> <p>America, now is not the time for small plans.</p> <p>Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy. Michelle and I are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education. And I will not settle for an America where some kids don't have that chance. I'll invest in early childhood education. I'll recruit an army of new teachers, and pay them higher salaries and give them more support. And in exchange, I'll ask for higher standards and more accountability. And we will keep our promise to every young American - if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education.</p> <p>Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible healthcare for every single American. If you have healthcare, my plan will lower your premiums. If you don't, you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves. And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most.</p> <p>Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent.</p> <p>Now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws, so that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses; and the time to protect social security for future generations.</p> <p>And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons.</p> <p>Now, many of these plans will cost money, which is why I've laid out how I'll pay for every dime - by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help America grow. But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet 21st-century challenges with a 20th-century bureaucracy.</p> <p>And Democrats, we must also admit that fulfilling America's promise will require more than just money. It will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what John F Kennedy called our \"intellectual and moral strength\". Yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient. Yes, we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair. But we must also admit that programmes alone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need.</p> <p>Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility - that's the essence of America's promise.</p> <p>And just as we keep our promise to the next generation here at home, so must we keep America's promise abroad. If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament, and judgment, to serve as the next commander-in-chief, that's a debate I'm ready to have.</p> <p>For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face. When John McCain said we could just \"muddle through\" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights. John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell - but he won't even go to the cave where he lives.</p> <p>And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79bn surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.</p> <p>That's not the judgment we need. That won't keep America safe. We need a president who can face the threats of the future, not keep grasping at the ideas of the past.</p> <p>You don't defeat a terrorist network that operates in 80 countries by occupying Iraq. You don't protect Israel and deter Iran just by talking tough in Washington. You can't truly stand up for Georgia when you've strained our oldest alliances. If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice - but it is not the change we need.</p> <p>We are the party of Roosevelt. We are the party of Kennedy. So don't tell me that Democrats won't defend this country. Don't tell me that Democrats won't keep us safe. The Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans - Democrats and Republicans - have built, and we are here to restore that legacy.</p> <p>As commander-in-chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home.</p> <p>I will end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al-Qaida and the Taliban in Afghanistan. I will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts. But I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression. I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and disease. And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future.</p> <p>These are the policies I will pursue. And in the weeks ahead, I look forward to debating them with John McCain.</p> <p>But what I will not do is suggest that the senator takes his positions for political purposes. Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism.</p> <p>The times are too serious, the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook. So let us agree that patriotism has no party. I love this country, and so do you, and so does John McCain. The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents, but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag. They have not served a Red America or a Blue America - they have served the United States of America.</p> <p>So I've got news for you, John McCain. We all put our country first.</p> <p>America, our work will not be easy. The challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past. For part of what has been lost these past eight years can't just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits. What has also been lost is our sense of common purpose - our sense of higher purpose. And that's what we have to restore.</p> <p>We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country. The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me we can't uphold the second amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals. I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination. Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers. This too is part of America's promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort.</p> <p>I know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk. They claim that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values. And that's to be expected. Because if you don't have any fresh ideas, then you use stale tactics to scare the voters. If you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from.</p> <p>You make a big election about small things.</p> <p>And you know what - it's worked before. Because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government. When Washington doesn't work, all its promises seem empty. If your hopes have been dashed again and again, then it's best to stop hoping, and settle for what you already know.</p> <p>I get it. I realise that I am not the likeliest candidate for this office. I don't fit the typical pedigree, and I haven't spent my career in the halls of Washington.</p> <p>But I stand before you tonight because all across America something is stirring. What the nay-sayers don't understand is that this election has never been about me. It's been about you.</p> <p>For 18 long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the politics of the past. You understand that in this election, the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result. You have shown what history teaches us - that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washington. Change comes to Washington. Change happens because the American people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time.</p> <p>America, this is one of those moments.</p> <p>I believe that as hard as it will be, the change we need is coming. Because I've seen it. Because I've lived it. I've seen it in Illinois, when we provided healthcare to more children and moved more families from welfare to work. I've seen it in Washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands.</p> <p>And I've seen it in this campaign. In the young people who voted for the first time, and in those who got involved again after a very long time. In the Republicans who never thought they'd pick up a Democratic ballot, but did. I've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs, in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the good neighbours who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise.</p> <p>This country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich. We have the most powerful military on Earth, but that's not what makes us strong. Our universities and our culture are the envy of the world, but that's not what keeps the world coming to our shores.</p> <p>Instead, it is that American spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend.</p> <p>That promise is our greatest inheritance. It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot.</p> <p>And it is that promise that 45 years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a mall in Washington, before Lincoln's memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream.</p> <p>The men and women who gathered there could've heard many things. They could've heard words of anger and discord. They could've been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred.</p> <p>But what the people heard instead - people of every creed and colour, from every walk of life - is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked. That together, our dreams can be one.</p> <p>\"We cannot walk alone,\" the preacher cried. \"And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back.\"</p> <p>America, we cannot turn back. Not with so much work to be done. Not with so many children to educate, and so many veterans to care for. Not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save. Not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend. America, we cannot turn back. We cannot walk alone. At this moment, in this election, we must pledge once more to march into the future. Let us keep that promise - that American promise - and in the words of scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess.</p> <p>Thank you, God bless you and God bless the United States of America.</p>",
  "<p>[I'm liveblogging tonight's events <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.barackobama\">here</a>.]</p> <p>[I've replaced the excerpts that were here previously with the full advance text]</p> <p>To Chairman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin; and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation;</p> <p>With profound gratitude and great humility, I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.</p> <p>.</p> <p>Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey, and especially the one who traveled the farthest a champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours -- Hillary Rodham Clinton. To President Clinton, who last night made the case for change as only he can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service; and to the next Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden, I thank you. I am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time, a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night.</p> <p>To the love of my life, our next First Lady, Michelle Obama, and to Sasha and Malia I love you so much, and I'm so proud of all of you.</p> <p>Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to.</p> <p>It is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well.</p> <p>That's why I stand here tonight. Because for two hundred and thirty two years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors -- found the courage to keep it alive.</p> <p>We meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more.</p> <p>Tonight, more Americans are out of work and more are working harder for less. More of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet. More of you have cars you can't afford to drive, credit card bills you can't afford to pay, and tuition that's beyond your reach.</p> <p>These challenges are not all of government's making. But the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed policies of George W. Bush.</p> <p>America, we are better than these last eight years. We are a better country than this.</p> <p>This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work.</p> <p>This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news.</p> <p>We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes.</p> <p>Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land enough! This moment this election is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise alive. Because next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third. And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight. On November 4th, we must stand up and say: \"Eight is enough.\"</p> <p>Now let there be no doubt. The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect. And next week, we'll also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need.</p> <p>But the record's clear: John McCain has voted with George Bush ninety percent of the time. Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time? I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a ten percent chance on change.</p> <p>The truth is, on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives on health care and education and the economy Senator McCain has been anything but independent. He said that our economy has made \"great progress\" under this President. He said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong. And when one of his chief advisors the man who wrote his economic plan was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a \"mental recession,\" and that we've become, and I quote, \"a nation of whiners.\"</p> <p>A nation of whiners? Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made. Tell that to the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty. These are not whiners. They work hard and give back and keep going without complaint. These are the Americans that I know.</p> <p>Now, I don't believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of Americans. I just think he doesn't know. Why else would he define middle-class as someone making under five million dollars a year? How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million Americans? How else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatize Social Security and gamble your retirement?</p> <p>It's not because John McCain doesn't care. It's because John McCain doesn't get it.</p> <p>For over two decades, he's subscribed to that old, discredited Republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else. In Washington, they call this the Ownership Society, but what it really means is you're on your own. Out of work? Tough luck. No health care? The market will fix it. Born into poverty? Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps even if you don't have boots. You're on your own.</p> <p>Well it's time for them to own their failure. It's time for us to change America.</p> <p>You see, we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country.</p> <p>We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma. We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush.</p> <p>We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work.</p> <p>The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight.</p> <p>Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill.</p> <p>In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships.</p> <p>When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed.</p> <p>And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman. She's the one who taught me about hard work. She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life. She poured everything she had into me. And although she can no longer travel, I know that she's watching tonight, and that tonight is her night as well.</p> <p>I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine. These are my heroes. Theirs are the stories that shaped me. And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as President of the United States.</p> <p>What is that promise?</p> <p>It's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will, but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect.</p> <p>It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road.</p> <p>Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology.</p> <p>Our government should work for us, not against us. It should help us, not hurt us. It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every American who's willing to work.</p> <p>That's the promise of America the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper.</p> <p>That's the promise we need to keep. That's the change we need right now. So let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if I am President.</p> <p>.</p> <p>Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it.</p> <p>Unlike John McCain, I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America.</p> <p>I will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start-ups that will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow.</p> <p>I will cut taxes cut taxes for 95% of all working families. Because in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle-class.</p> <p>And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East.</p> <p>Washington's been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years, and John McCain has been there for twenty-six of them. In that time, he's said no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars, no to investments in renewable energy, no to renewable fuels. And today, we import triple the amount of oil as the day that Senator McCain took office.</p> <p>Now is the time to end this addiction, and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution. Not even close.</p> <p>As President, I will tap our natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology, and find ways to safely harness nuclear power. I'll help our auto companies re-tool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in America. I'll make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars. And I'll invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced.</p> <p>America, now is not the time for small plans.</p> <p>Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy. Michelle and I are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education. And I will not settle for an America where some kids don't have that chance. I'll invest in early childhood education. I'll recruit an army of new teachers, and pay them higher salaries and give them more support. And in exchange, I'll ask for higher standards and more accountability.

But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy.</p> <p>And Democrats, we must also admit that fulfilling America's promise will require more than just money. It will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what John F. Kennedy called our \"intellectual and moral strength.\" Yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient. Yes, we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair. But we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need.</p> <p>Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility that's the essence of America's promise.</p> <p>And just as we keep our keep our promise to the next generation here at home, so must we keep America's promise abroad.

And in the weeks ahead, I look forward to debating them with John McCain.</p> <p>But what I will not do is suggest that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes. Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism.</p> <p>The times are too serious, the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook. So let us agree that patriotism has no party. I love this country, and so do you, and so does John McCain. The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents, but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag. They have not served a Red America or a Blue America they have served the United States of America.</p> <p>So I've got news for you, John McCain. We all put our country first.</p> <p>America, our work will not be easy. The challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past. For part of what has been lost these past eight years can't just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits. What has also been lost is our sense of common purpose our sense of higher purpose. And that's what we have to restore.</p> <p>We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country. The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang-violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me we can't uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals. I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination. Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers. This too is part of America's promise the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort.</p> <p>I know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk. They claim that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values. And that's to be expected. Because if you don't have any fresh ideas, then you use stale tactics to scare the voters. If you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from.</p> <p>You make a big election about small things.</p> <p>And you know what it's worked before. Because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government. When Washington doesn't work, all its promises seem empty. If your hopes have been dashed again and again, then it's best to stop hoping, and settle for what you already know.</p> <p>I get it. I realize that I am not the likeliest candidate for this office. I don't fit the typical pedigree, and I haven't spent my career in the halls of Washington.</p> <p>But I stand before you tonight because all across America something is stirring. What the nay-sayers don't understand is that this election has never been about me. It's been about you.</p> <p>For eighteen long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the politics of the past. You understand that in this election, the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result. You have shown what history teaches us that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washington. Change comes to Washington. Change happens because the American people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time.</p> <p>America, this is one of those moments.</p> <p>I believe that as hard as it will be, the change we need is coming. Because I've seen it. Because I've lived it. I've seen it in Illinois, when we provided health care to more children and moved more families from welfare to work. I've seen it in Washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands.</p> <p>And I've seen it in this campaign. In the young people who voted for the first time, and in those who got involved again after a very long time. In the Republicans who never thought they'd pick up a Democratic ballot, but did. I've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs, in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the good neighbors who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise.</p> <p>This country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich. We have the most powerful military on Earth, but that's not what makes us strong. Our universities and our culture are the envy of the world, but that's not what keeps the world coming to our shores.</p> <p>Instead, it is that American spirit that American promise that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend.</p> <p>That promise is our greatest inheritance. It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot.</p> <p>And it is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream.</p> <p>The men and women who gathered there could've heard many things. They could've heard words of anger and discord. They could've been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred.</p> <p>But what the people heard instead people of every creed and color, from every walk of life is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked. That together, our dreams can be one.</p> <p>\"We cannot walk alone,\" the preacher cried. \"And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back.\"</p> <p>America, we cannot turn back. Not with so much work to be done. Not with so many children to educate, and so many veterans to care for. Not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save. Not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend. America, we cannot turn back. We cannot walk alone. At this moment, in this election, we must pledge once more to march into the future. Let us keep that promise that American promise and in the words of Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess.</p> <p>Thank you, God Bless you, and God Bless the United States of America.</p> <p>[<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.barackobama\">Go back</a> to the liveblog]</p>",
  "<p>Maybe it hardly bears thinking about the morning of November 5 if Barack Obama has lost to John McCain the previous day. And it may seem perverse to think about it at all on a day like today, when Obama yet again commands the stage. But let's try to do it, right now, partly because the closeness of the polls suggests a narrow McCain win is a real possibility \u2014 partly because there has been so much underlying nervousness, as well as renewed exhilaration, among Democrats in Denver this week; and partly just out of common political prudence. </p> <p>So, why might McCain win on November 4? I think there are five main reasons to consider. </p> <p>The first is that these remain insecure times. The economic downturn has been very real in the US, in spite of yesterday's good growth figures. America's fear of rising fuel prices remains a potent electoral issue, laced as it now is with the fear that high oil prices are lining the coffers of America's enemies in places such as Russia, Iran and Venezuela. American soldiers are fighting difficult wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. McCain has a big poll lead on national security, foreign policy and ability to deal with a crisis. Every Russian tank rumbling around the Caucasus is harvesting votes for McCain \u2014 and the electorate may prefer to entrust the country to a leader with warrior credentials than take a chance on a visionary neophyte. </p> <p>The second reason why McCain might win is that this election is no longer about George Bush. America in late 2008 has a president who is a member of the political living dead. His name was barely mentioned at the Democratic convention this week. Along with Dick Cheney he will make an early appearance at St Paul on Monday at the Republican convention; after that, he's out of it. And with him may go many of his negatives. That leaves McCain some elbow room to fight the campaign his own way. McCain is a tough campaigner. He is also a smart one. He could do well in the televised debates. Compared with the midterms in 2006, the Democrats may find it hard to make this an election about Bush. </p> <p>Which brings us to reason No 3. American presidential elections are always close these days. Bush beat John Kerry with just 51% of the popular vote in 2004 and was neck-and-neck with Al Gore in 2000. In the electoral college Bush won by 286-251 against Kerry and by 271-266 against Gore. In the past four presidential elections \u2014 even the two that Bill Clinton won \u2014 no Democratic candidate has ever polled more than 49%. Democratic landslides have not been in fashion since 1964. This year's polls \u2014 in which Obama's average lead is now just 1.8% \u2014 are beginning to point to yet another 50:50 election. In these close races discipline, negative campaigning, and get-out-the vote organisation in the battleground states all matter. Over the years these have been Republican strengths, not Democratic ones. </p> <p>Recent polls also point to the fourth piece of good news for McCain: voters may be suffering from Obama fatigue. Obama is still fighting a campaign that is centred on self. His own story, his own vision and his own uniqueness are at the heart of his message. He consciously takes the whole weight of the campaign on his own slim shoulders, as he did again last night by taking his acceptance speech out of the convention hall and into the local football stadium, where he spoke against a backdrop of Greek pillars. Hubris? What if the nation that fell in love with Obama in the first phase of his great campaign decides he is yesterday's rock star as the real election nears. I think Obama is well aware of this \u2014 but voters don't just want big vision and soaring oratory. </p> <p>The final reason is simply Obama's race. The nomination of a black man to be president is not something marginal but something massive. It goes to the heart of whether America's self-identity is genuinely multiracial, or whether , in spite of everything, it is still white. This election isn't just about the possibility of a black president, but the possibility of a black first family. It asks white voters to see themselves embodied and represented by African-Americans, and to vote to be led by black people. This is something bigger than electing a woman leader would be, were that on offer. Race and slavery are America's original sin. The election of Obama would be, beyond question, one of the noblest gestures of historical redemption that Americans have ever been called upon to make. But that is precisely why it may not happen. </p> <p>So if, on January 20 2009, it is McCain, not Obama, who stands in the winter's air on Capitol Hill to be sworn in as Bush's successor, what would that mean for America and the world? The first thing to say is not to exaggerate the domestic or even the international impact; McCain would be the president of an already humbled, not newly triumphalist, conservatism. The economy would dominate his agenda. The next, umbilically linked point is to remember that McCain would have to work with a Congress in which, on the same election day, the Democrats are likely to strengthen their majority in the House of Representatives and secure firm control of the Senate. He could very easily find himself a weak president. </p> <p>Yet there could be no disguising the lessons for the Democrats, who would have lost three winnable presidential contests in a row. If Obama loses, there will not be another African-American nominee for at least a generation. Hillary Clinton might have the consolation that she would become, overnight, the overwhelming favourite to finally win the Democratic nomination in 2012. But who would bet against such a divisive figure not extending the losing streak from three to four? It would begin to look as if the only way of getting a Democrat into the White House would be as the result of an armed uprising. </p> <p>All that would be as nothing to the global dismay that would greet the election of President McCain. Much of the world would simply despair of the American people \u2014 and so would many Americans. Anti-Americanism would have a new recruiting sergeant, and global confi dence in the democratic progressive project would suffer a historic blow. November 5 would be a bonfire night of the liberal vanities. I tend to think it won't happen that way \u2014 but it certainly could. And it may all be just 10 short weeks away.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's plans for a new generation of nuclear power stations will face a fierce challenge for skills and resources from countries keen to build their own, according to research published today. </p> <p>China has plans for 24 nuclear plants and outline proposals for another 76, according to the Economic Research Council, using figures from the International Energy Agency and the IAEA. </p> <p>\"China's plans indicate its key role in new nuclear build, and the impact of just a small element of its projects being realised would have major implications for new nuclear build capacity \u2014 and the many constraints,\" according to the ERC.</p> <p>The research into planned and proposed nuclear plants is part of the ERC's Digest of Energy Statistics 2008, tracking energy trends including consumption, reserves, prices and efficiency at the<br>European Union and world levels. The ERC defines planned plants as those with funding and planning consent , while proposed plants may lack funding, planning consent or both. </p> <p>One of the digest's editors, Nigel Hawkins, said there had been little nuclear new-build in the world after the Chernobyl disaster 20 years ago, but rising fossil fuel prices and the need for new electricity capacity has meant that most leading countries are now looking at the possibility of new nuclear facilities. </p> <p>\"Over the next 20 to 30 years we are going to see a major ramp-up in nuclear build ,\" he said. </p> <p>Hawkins pointed out that the number of companies capable of nuclear newbuild was limited. They include Areva, which has applied jointly with EDF for UK approval of the technology for the EPR reactor, General Electric, Westinghouse \u2014 which Toshiba bought from British Nuclear Fuels in early 2006 \u2014 and Atomic Energy of Canada. </p> <p>In Britain, the authorities are looking at building a small number of nuclear power plants and are studying at least three reactor designs. British Energy and the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority are expected to put forward a number of sites close to existing nuclear plants or former facilities which have been closed. </p> <p>Hawkins warned that, given the volumes under consideration by Beijing, the relatively small programme being considered by Britain could mean China would be seen as more of a priority by nuclear plant construction companies</p> <p>In June, business and enterprise secretary John Hutton said: \"As more and more countries seek to insulate themselves against future energy price rises and the irrefutable reality of climate change, they're competing hard to enable their own nuclear programmes. </p> <p>\"The UK government has the ambition and commitment to build and maintain the best market in the world for companies to do business in nuclear power.</p> <p>\"The UK must aim to become the world's number one location for new nuclear investment.\" </p> <p>The government owns more than a third of British Energy and has given its blessing to plans for EDF to make a bid for the company, though no offer has yet emerged because of opposition by other shareholders. EDF is seen as a good fit because it has the experience of running existing nuclear power plants and nuclear new -build. But the government is keen to stress that its nuclear policy does not rest entirely on a British Energy/EDF tie-up. </p> <p>A spokesman from the Department for Business and Enterprise said: \"We are not putting all our eggs into one basket. \"</p>"
