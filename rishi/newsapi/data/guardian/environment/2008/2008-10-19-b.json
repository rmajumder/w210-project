  "<p>Marine biologists have warned of significant and serious changes in the seas around Britain after detecting a steep and \"frightening\" fall in the numbers of common seals around the coast.</p> <p>Common seals are one of Britain's largest and most charismatic marine predators and the most likely to be seen by holidaymakers and sailors. But the latest surveys have revealed a dramatic decline in their numbers in Scotland's waters and along eastern England.</p> <p>In the worst affected areas, such as the Orkney islands, the numbers of common seals are falling by 10% a year, and have dropped by as much as half in the past six years. Along the Argyll coast, from Oban to the Mull of Kintyre, the numbers fell by a quarter last year. </p> <p>Ian Boyd, a professor with the sea mammals research unit at St Andrew's University, said it was as if the entire population had stopped breeding. </p> <p>The cause was baffling scientists. \"We just don't know,\" he said. \"Our collective view is that there's some large-scale process going on in the northern North Sea which is driving down seal numbers. We're seeing a massive decline. It's quite a frightening decline because these populations don't change as quickly as that under normal circumstances. </p> <p>\"This is very abnormal. To give you an idea of the level of abnormality, the rates of decline are equivalent to these populations producing no offspring for five or six years.\" </p> <p>The steep declines mirror other crises in the marine environment. Biologists have reported plummeting sea bird populations, with falls of a third in numbers of puffins on the Farne islands off the Northumberland coast, and the Isle of May at the Firth of Forth, as well as declines in food sources for mammals and birds, such as sand eels. At the same time, warmer-water animals from plankton through to large fish are moving north.</p> <p>Boyd said it was too early to say whether climate change was directly connected to the collapse of seal populations. He said his unit and other marine biologists were investigating a number of possibilities, including the theory that common seals - also known as harbour seals - were up against stiff competition from the larger, more robust grey seals for increasingly scarce food supplies.</p> <p>Some studies suggested that killer whales, now hunting in larger numbers around Orkney and Shetland, were killing seals at pupping time. </p> <p>People could be illegally shooting the seals in fish-farming areas and at inshore fishing grounds. But Boyd said these problems were localised and could not explain the UK-wide declines. The causes were likely to be complex.</p> <p>The latest findings will be raised at a conference this month in Edinburgh run by the conservation agency Scottish Natural Heritage, which will give conservationists the chance to debate the challenges of climate change, alien species and conflicts between species, including common and grey seals.</p> <p>All the main environment groups want the Scottish government to use powers under the proposed marine bill for Scotland to legally protect common seals, by abolishing the Seal Conservation Act 1970, which allows salmon farmers and the fishing industry to legally shoot seals that appear to damage their nets. Instead, seals should be a protected species under the Wildlife and Countryside Act, they say. </p> <p>The Guardian has learned that the latest figures show that last year common seal numbers fell from 4,256 to 3,379 in Orkney, from 1,056 to 800 along the eastern coast of the northern Highlands, from 113 to 102 in the north-east, in Grampian, and from 6,702 to 4,732 on the west coast from Oban to the Mull of Kintyre. There was also a fall, from 445 to 215, in Fife, and by nearly half in the smaller populations around Lothian and Dumfries and Galloway. </p> <p>In English waters, smaller populations at the nature reserves at Blakeney Point, in Norfolk, and Donna Nook, in Lincolnshire, also fell sharply. </p> <p>Some areas have shown increases, particularly the Wash, where numbers rose from 1,695 to 2,162 last year. But total numbers across the UK fell by 12% last year at the 13 sites where counts were made over two years - down by 3,120 animals to 23,277, a drop that early figures suggest has continued this year. </p> <p>Boyd said that, by contrast, there had been \"rapid growth\" in the nearest population on the continent, in the Wadden Sea, off the Dutch, German and Danish coasts. \"We ought to be worried because these animals are at the top of the marine food chain and are in a sense bellwethers of what's going on in the marine environment,\" he said. \"Quite apart from the fact that they're charismatic species, they're indicators of the level of robustness that there is within the marine environment, and if we're seeing populations declining rapidly like this, it's got to ring alarm bells.\"</p> <p>John Baxter, a senior marine biologist with Scottish Natural Heritage, said the agency shared was helping investigate the decline. \"These fluctuations are very large, and we've no way of knowing whether there's a natural fluctuation and numbers may recover, or whether there're more serious underlying causes.\"</p>",
  "<p>The shocking increase in the scourge of hunger (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/16/internationalaidanddevelopment-voluntarysector\">Billion go hungry as rich countries fail to pay up, Oxfam says</a>, October 16) has led many organisations in developing countries to rename October 16 as World Foodless Day. We support them and want to point out that the situation is even worse than your report suggests: many of the hungry are farmers forced off their lands. The millennium development goal of halving hunger is fading. </p> <p>Governments have not accepted responsibility for this failure to ensure their citizens' right to food, nor are they prepared to call to account those who caused and have profited from the food crisis. While bankers wallow in trillions of dollars of state aid, the hungry are being forgotten, yet the causes and impacts are similar: irresponsible speculation and unfair global trading for which the poor pay the final price. Hunger, it seems, is the inconvenient fallout of our globalised food system. </p> <p>We need deep-rooted changes in how agriculture is practised, commodities are traded, and the food system is organised and regulated. The necessary changes, towards localised food sovereignty through sustainable production, were highlighted by the UN/World Bank international agricultural assessment, which our government approved in June. With hunger such a scar on humanity, why does the government remain silent about implementing its findings?<br><strong>Belinda Calaguas </strong>ActionAid UK,<strong> Linda Craig </strong>PAN-UK,<strong> John Hilary </strong>War on Want,<strong> Vicki Hird </strong>Friends of the Earth,<strong> Robin Maynard </strong>Soil Association,<strong> Daleep Mukarji </strong>Christian Aid,<strong> Patrick Mulvany </strong>Practical Action,<strong> Helena Paul </strong>Econexus,<strong> Pete Riley </strong>GM Freeze,<strong> Dan Taylor </strong>Find Your Feet,<strong> Julia Wright </strong>Garden Organic</p>",
  "<p>The emerging pressure from different member states to scale back EU climate policy in the face of economic downturn is a major blow, both to the environment and to the EU economy (Europe's leaders struggle to stop emissions package unravelling, October 17). </p> <p>The French presidency appears to be driving for an agreement based on the lowest common denominator, effectively giving every member state the possibility to beg for special treatment. The aim is clearly to bully the European parliament into accepting an agreement at any cost.</p> <p>The parliament must not and will not succumb. This a la carte approach would rip all substance out of the package, leaving the EU with an empty shell of legislation which makes a mockery of its supposed \"global leadership\".</p> <p>Many of the measures to reduce our emissions are no-brainers for the economy. Improving efficiency - whether of vehicles, industrial production through the emissions trading scheme (ETS), power generation or buildings - will save money. It will reduce our dependence on energy imports and the massive economic instability that this brings. So too will increasing the development of renewable energies, which will also create thousands of jobs. </p> <p>Climate policy offers an opportunity to shift our economies away from the boom-bust cycle of an overexploitative, speculative fossil-fuel-based economy. Failure to grasp it will exacerbate both the economic and the climate crises.<br><strong>Dr Caroline Lucas MEP</strong><br>Leader, Green party</p> <p>The importance of the statement by Europe's leaders to get a deal on the climate change should not be underestimated. There has been intense lobbying by some in industry for months (long before the current financial crisis) to derail the fast-track timetable, which should see Euro-MPs and ministers reach rapid agreement on a package of laws to deliver the 2020 targets. </p> <p>But Thursday's statement by EU leaders, together with the big majorities in the committee stage in the European parliament, provide a solid foundation for future work. The ball is now in the court of the French government, current chair of the EU, to put a negotiating text on the table quickly so that a final agreement can be reached by Christmas. MEPs are ready. Ministers must deliver.<br><strong>Linda McAvan MEP</strong><br>European spokesperson on climate change, Labour party</p> <p>Your article on the Eliasch review regarding forests and climate change (Global fund 'could pay owners to keep rainforests safe', October 14) says Guyana supports a new approach to forest conservation based on carbon trading. What the piece does not mention is that local communities in Guyana have not been properly involved in discussions. Having just returned from Guyana, I can attest that most of those who will be affected have no idea what carbon is, let alone what implications the international carbon market may have for them. In many cases, the land claims by Guyana's indigenous peoples remain unresolved more than 40 years after independence from Britain. If efforts to save the world's forests are to succeed, they must ensure communities' involvement in decision-making. Crucially, the rights of those who depend on the forest must be respected.<br><strong>Tom Griffiths</strong><br>Forest Peoples Programme</p> <p>The Eliasch review is unequivocal that carbon markets offer the best financing mechanism available, measured by efficiency, effectiveness and equity, and that reducing tropical deforestation is essential to stabilising the global climate by mid-century. The figure of $3.7tn, raised as the potential long-term net benefit from halving deforestation, is as much as, if not more than, the amount lost to date in the global financial crisis. </p> <p>Current EU regulation bans forest credits from the EU ETS, thereby effectively preventing investment. The EU parliament environment and industry committees, with cross-party support, have each now proposed amendments to the linking directive to lift this ban. But with the European commission opposed to change, it will be the decision of the council of ministers. If the UK government meant what it said in endorsing the Eliasch review, it should vote in favour of admitting forest-based credits into the scheme from 2013. Ed Miliband may be new to office, but he must seize this opportunity quickly. We urge him to show leadership in Europe. <br><strong>Henry Derwent</strong><br>Chief executive officer, International Emissions Trading Association, <br><strong>Abyd Karmali</strong><br>President, Carbon Markets &amp; Investors Association</p> <p>It's great news that Ed Miliband has started his new role at the Department for Energy and Climate Change by announcing a target of at least 80% emissions cuts by 2050 (Report, October 17). His commitment to a target of 30% cuts by 2020 across Europe is also to be applauded. However, he must also ensure that these two targets are not undermined by the continued building of high-carbon infrastructure while buying in carbon credits from overseas. Building new coal-fired plants completely points in the wrong direction. <br><strong>Sara Shaw</strong><br>Climate change policy adviser, Tearfund</p> <p>An 80% target for reducing carbon emissions will rightfully draw gasps of glee and questions on how to meet it in equal measure. It is an ambitious challenge, and one which cannot be met without carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. </p> <p>If the UK is to stand any chance of meeting this goal it is essential CCS is developed without delay. Despite some opinion, fossil fuels will remain the backbone of the UK's energy mix, and CCS is the only viable way to prevent carbon emissions from entering the atmosphere. It is not the only answer, but CCS must be part of the climate change solution. <br><strong>Dr Jeff Chapman</strong><br>Chief executive, Carbon Capture and Storage Association</p>",
  "<p>Swiss Re, the world's largest reinsurance company, has joined forces with the private equity group CVC in a bid for the Direct Line and Churchill Insurance businesses of Royal Bank of Scotland. The deal is expected to value the operations at \u00a36bn.</p> <p>The CVC-led bid is being directed by RBS's former financial director Fred Watts, who quit the bank in 2005. He had been with RBS for five and a half years and joined CVC last year.</p> <p>It is understood that the deal will see CVC-Swiss Re pay some \u00a33bn to take a 51% stake in RBS's insurance business, which also includes Privilege, Green Flag, UKI Partnerships and NIG. The two sides of the deal are said to be in \"advanced talks\" and CVC has been given up to six weeks to complete the transaction.</p> <p>RBS - which has been torn apart by the credit crisis and is now in line for a capital injection from the UK government that would put the government in control of the Edinburgh-based bank with a 60% stake - has been attempting to sell its insurance operations for six months. It put the division up for sale when it announced plans to raise \u00a312bn from shareholders to bolster its core capital. It now requires another \u00a320bn and its chief executive, Sir Fred Goodwin, and chairman, Sir Tom McKillop, are leaving. Goodwin had always been opposed to a fire sale of the insurance business.</p> <p>The \u00a36bn valuation of the insurance business will be regarded as a good price, although back in the summer the bank had hoped to achieve \u00a37bn. RBS is the second-largest general insurer in the UK and has 18,000 staff. It is the UK's largest insurer of cars, as well as a major player in travel, home and pet insurance. It also provides cover for 2 million motorists overseas and is the biggest direct insurer in Spain.</p> <p>CVC is said to be putting up most of the capital to fund the deal, with Swiss Re underwriting the risk. There is speculation that a third party may also be brought into the consortium.</p> <p>Last night, CVC refused to comment on its talks with RBS, but a deal between the two will be seen as a setback for the US insurer Allstate, which it is thought had been in pole position to buy the entire business, rather than just a majority stake. </p> <p>CVC, which is based in Luxembourg, has 19 offices across Europe and its past investments have included Hozelock, Debenhams, Formula One, the Saga/AA brands and the Belgian postal service. It currently owns 49 companies worldwide, employing some 376,000 people. It has 38 investments in Europe and 14 in Asia.</p> <p>Swiss Re, based in Zurich, operates in 25 countries and provides insurance for insurers, mainly for property and casualty risks, life and health insurance.</p> <p>RBS is also reported to be reviewing the future of its Ulster Bank and First Active offshoots in Ireland. The Irish Independent reported yesterday that the heads of all RBS divisions had been summoned to meetings with their new boss, Stephen Hester, in the coming weeks. Earlier this week Hester said the business was likely to be shrunk and that a list of saleable assets was now likely to get longer.</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p>Direct Line was founded in 1985 to sell insurance straight to motorists by phone. It was backed with \u00a320m of funding from RBS and created controversy because a pay deal agreed with the insurer's founder, Peter Wood, made him one of the UK's best-paid businessmen. Churchill Insurance was launched in 1989 and acquired by RBS in 2003 for \u00a31.1bn. Churchill's founder, Martin Long, made an estimated \u00a360m in the deal.</p>",
  "<p>Interpol is planning to expand its role into the mass screening of passengers moving around the world by creating a face recognition database to catch wanted suspects.</p> <p>Every year more than 800 million international travellers fail to undergo \"the most basic scrutiny\" to check whether their identity documents have been stolen, the global policing cooperation body has warned. </p> <p>Senior figures want a system that lets immigration officials capture digital images of passengers and immediately cross-check them against a database of pictures of terror suspects, international criminals and fugitives.</p> <p>The UK's first automated face recognition gates - matching passengers to their digital image in the latest generation of passports - began operating at Manchester airport in August.</p> <p>Mark Branchflower, head of Interpol's fingerprint unit, will this week unveil proposals in London for the creation of biometric identification systems that could be linked to such immigration checks. </p> <p>The civil liberties group No2ID, which campaigns against identity cards, expressed alarm at the plans. </p> <p>\"This is a move away from seeking specific persons to GCHQ-style bulk interception of information,\" warned spokesman Michael Parker. </p> <p>\"There's already a fair amount of information collected in terms of passenger records. This is the next step. Law enforcement agencies want the most efficient systems but there has to be a balance between security and privacy.\" The growth of international criminal gangs and the spread of terrorist threats has increased demand for Interpol's services. </p> <p>Last year it carried out 10,000 fingerprint searches; this year the figure will reach 20,000. </p> <p>An automated fingerprint identification system with far greater capacity, known as Metamorpho, will be installed next year. Earlier this month Interpol launched its \"global security initiative\" aimed at raising $1bn (\u00a3577m) to strengthen its law enforcement programmes. It claims to hold the \"names and identifiers\" of 9,000 terrorist suspects.</p> <p>Branchflower will speak at the opening of the Biometrics 2008 conference in Westminster about the possibility of extending its biometric database. </p> <p>Before the conference he said that Interpol wanted to create a face recognition database, to match its fingerprint and DNA records, that could be searched and matched automatically. </p> <p>\"Facial recognition is a step we could go to quite quickly,\" said Branchflower, \"and it's increasingly of use to [all] countries. There's so much data we have but they are in records we can't search.\"</p> <p>If Interpol had been operating a face recognition database linked to national border controls last autumn, he said, it might have picked up a Canadian teacher wanted for child abuse as he entered Thailand. The paedophile was the subject of a high-profile manhunt. </p> <p>\"We could have picked him up the moment he entered Bangkok rather than having to wait another two weeks,\" said Branchflower.\"We need to get our data to the border entry points. There will be such a large role in the future for fingerprints and facial recognition.\"</p>",
  "<p>Judging by the seemingly limitless budgets enjoyed by their famous Lancashire neighbours it would be easy for the optimistic supporters of Burnley to believe the myth that football remains recession-proof. At Turf Moor, however, reality, and more particularly the credit crunch, is beginning to bite. </p> <p>The build-up to what promised to be one of the matches of the season had been overshadowed by a statement from the club's chief executive, Paul Fletcher, suggesting ambitious expansion plans had been put on hold. On Saturday he sought to qualify his comments and pacify those Burnley fans looking forward to the long-overdue revamp of Turf Moor.</p> <p>\"The word on the street is that the ground redevelopment is to be mothballed,\" said Fletcher. \"That is nonsense. But when a problem comes along, such as the global meltdown that is affecting absolutely everyone, then I think the time has come to scrutinise every decision surrounding the plan.\" </p> <p>Burnley's captain, Steven Caldwell, advocates a brave approach at a time when standing still could undermine the long-term plan to bring Premier League football to Turf Moor for the first time. \"I was sold on the ambition of the club and hopefully it still has that ambition - credit crunch or not,\" he said.</p> <p>On the pitch Burnley appear to be in rude health and had the home team built on Chris McCann's 25th-minute goal this would have been a pointless exercise for the Championship's title favourites. </p> <p>The introduction of the Birmingham forwards James McFadden and Cameron Jerome after the break changed the momentum of a fascinating fixture and the latter tapped home his fourth goal of the season 13 minutes from time to secure a fortunate point.

  "<p>The new government minister in charge of a string of vital decisions about Britain's media and technology industries has claimed that the importance of securing their future has increased due to the global financial crisis.</p> <p>Stephen Carter, who was appointed to the new role of minister for communications, technology and broadcasting earlier this month and reports to both the culture secretary, Andy Burnham, and the business secretary, Peter Mandelson, vowed to accelerate decision-making in a number of key areas. </p> <p>\"Whatever is going to happen to the macro-economy, we can all agree that, in the short- and possibly medium-term, the financial services sector is going to take some time to restructure,\" said Carter, in his first interview since taking the job. \"So, from a UK plc perspective, this is an important sector and it becomes relatively an even more important sector.\"</p> <p>Carter, the founding chief executive of the media regulator Ofcom, who most recently spent a turbulent 10 months as Gordon Brown's chief of strategy and principal adviser, will draw together work in existing areas of government and has promised to deliver swift conclusions on a number of pressing issues. These include the future of digital radio, the questions surrounding the next generation of broadband access and mobile phone networks, and the future funding of public-service broadcasting. </p> <p>His report, Digital Britain, will also consider issues around the digital divide and look into whether there should be a guarantee of universal access to broadband for all consumers. He has promised to deliver a set of recommendations by January. </p> <p>Carter said it was a \"unique opportunity\" to set the direction of the broadcasting, technology and communications industries over the next five years. </p> <p>\"While we have a converged regulator, the machinery of government is still separated,\" he said. \"That was the rationale behind having a ministerial responsibility across the brief, and having someone who knows something about it.\" </p> <p>Carter's appointment to the new role was openly welcomed by Ofcom, where executives feel a number of key policy areas have now reached a point where they require urgent government action. </p> <p>But it is likely to be viewed with some trepidation by the BBC, which has been fighting a public battle with the regulator over the idea of potentially using the so-called \"surplus\" licence fee to fund a looming funding crisis among its public-service rivals. </p> <p>\"We're very good at this stuff in this country. The things that drive us mad because the tubes are crowded are actually rather good if you're looking at networks. You've got highly dense populations in a relatively small geography. Network density is a good thing. That's one of the reasons why we have such a rich free-to-air broadcast heritage,\" said Carter, who is also the former UK chief executive of the cable company NTL. </p> <p>\"English is an advantage, let's not underestimate that, and we're a nation of wordsmiths and creative people. We're as good at the poetry as we are at the pipes,\" he said. \"There is an opportunity to take an international lead as the major economy in the world that is seen as a leading powerhouse in and across these industries.\"</p> <p>While he was at Ofcom, broadcasters would sometimes complain that Carter was more concerned with building broadband networks than with safeguarding the future of public-service broadcasting. But he said last week that the two must go hand in hand. </p> <p>\"These are all important questions. But I always think it depends on how you come at them,\" he said. \"If the first question you ask is how to preserve regional news on broadcast television, that feels a pretty narrow way of entering the discussion. But that doesn't mean you can't enter it in a broader way and ask what it means for those things.\" </p> <p>He added: \"I have spent nearly 10 years of my life working in and around this subject. I think broadband is commercially, socially, culturally, economically and politically transforming. </p> <p>\"You have to look at the issues the other way around. We are now at a point where we have to get that right, or we might end up preserving the past.\" </p> <p>Carter said that after years of debate and discussion on issues such as public-service broadcasting, the time had come for decisions to be made. His conclusions will fall into three \"baskets\": some that can be enacted immediately; others that require modest legislation that can be pushed through before a general election, and other longer-term issues that will have to wait until after 2010.</p>",

Those costs, of doing too little, will be greater than if we take action to maintain spending and investment in the real economy, investing in the public sector and in infrastructure, too.\"</p> <p>But the strategy was immediately challenged by the shadow chancellor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne\">George Osborne</a>. \"While the chancellor speculates about the timing of big capital projects that could take years to get off the ground, that's not going to help small businesses struggling this winter,\" Osborne said. \"Government should be doing what it can to help, so jobs aren't lost.\" He said the Conservatives would allow small firms to delay their VAT payments by up to six months to give them breathing space.</p> <p>The row came on the eve of the latest quarterly business confidence monitor from Lloyds TSB, which shows that 23% of more than 200 companies surveyed expect their business activity to fall during the coming year, while only 31% expect it to increase. </p> <p>Two-thirds of firms are more pessimistic about the outlook for the economy than they were last month. </p> <p>The gloomy findings are likely to be echoed by the latest CBI quarterly monitor of British business tomorrow.</p> <p>The employer's organisation will be listening carefully to a speech being given on the same day by the Bank of England governor, Mervyn King, for hints of further interest rate cuts as early as next month.

It believes figures out this week will show the economy contracted in the third quarter of the year, after zero growth in the previous quarter. Two quarters of contraction are needed to meet the definition of a \"technical\" recession.</p> <p>Peter Spencer, the Item Club's chief economist, said: \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/20/opinion-polls-labour-conservatives-brown\">Gordon may have won plaudits</a> for stopping the systemic meltdown of the banking system over the last few days, but we now have to face up to the reality of an economy that has been seriously weakened by recent dramatic events.

  "<p>France's political elite yesterday rallied around Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the head of the International Monetary Fund, after it emerged that the former finance minister was facing an inquiry into whether he abused his position by having a sexual relationship with a subordinate.</p> <p>Strauss-Kahn was defended by President Nicolas Sarkozy's rightwing UMP party, which put him forward for the prestigious IMF appointment, as well as many of his fellow Socialists, several of whom consider him to be a potential future presidential candidate.</p> <p>\"Everyone accepts that he is a good chief of the IMF,\" said Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, first secretary of the leftwing PS party. Speaking on French radio, the cabinet spokesman, Luc Chatel, stressed Strauss-Kahn's solid handling of the financial crisis. \"He has shown throughout that he was on top of things,\" he said.</p> <p>Details of the affair, which was first reported at the weekend by the Wall Street Journal, provoked anger and suspicion in France, a country with clear media privacy laws. Many commentators questioned the timing of the leaks, amid a global financial crisis in which the IMF plays a key role. </p> <p>Others suggested the investigation, which was reportedly ordered by the head of the IMF's 24-member board with help from the US and Russia, was leaked deliberately to \"destabilise\" him.

  "<p>When San Juan's tiny San Ger\u00f3nimo fort last saw hostile action, its handful of cannons repelled an invasion by more than 60 British warships in 1797. Despite its size, the coastal garrison played an unlikely yet decisive role in the defence of Puerto Rico's capital city.</p> <p>Two centuries later, the historic fort is again at the heart of a battle for the Caribbean island's future. This time the warring parties are environmentalists campaigning against what they see as the continual destruction of an already overcrowded coastline, and the developers of a $250m (\u00a3145m) project to rejuvenate the ancient waterfront with a giant hotel, residential, shopping and entertainment complex.</p> <p>For more than a year, protesters have camped in tents at the site as cranes and 15-storey tower blocks of luxury flats rose around them, cutting off public access to the fort that has fallen into disrepair behind padlocked iron gates.</p> <p>They say that the construction is taking place on public land illegally sold by the government to a private developer, which has reneged on promises to maintain the fort and adjacent waterside walkways.</p> <p>Their protests are not just about the preservation of the 17th-century stronghold and its place in history. The environmentalists have chosen the Paseo Caribe development as a pivotal stand against the intense and largely unchecked pace of growth in Puerto Rico in recent years.</p> <p>\"This is a strategic battle,\" said Miguel Angel Reyes de Jesus, one of about 100 protesters at the site demanding the demolition of buildings nearing completion.</p> <p>\"If they win here they will take all of the country. We must stop this for the sake of our children and those who will come after them.\"</p> <p>Similar community activism has halted a hotel expansion project on the north coast and plans for two new huge resorts in the congested north east of the island, where protesters camped for two years. </p> <p>The Puerto Rican government, surprised by the scale of public opposition and concerned by the threat to water supplies and wildlife, rescinded construction permits. Hopes that Colombian-born developer Arturo Madero's licences for Paseo Caribe project would also be revoked were raised last year when justice department secretary Roberto S\u00e1nchez Ramos declared that the government had made a mistake in allowing the complex, and neighbouring Caribe Hilton hotel, to be illegally built on public land.</p> <p>In January the island's supreme court took the opposite view, removing the final legal hurdle to the project and allowing building work to surge ahead, with a caveat that the historic fort should reopen. </p> <p>\"San Ger\u00f3nimo is a public asset that belongs to the people of Puerto Rico, and access to it should be given free of restrictions,\" Chief Justice Hern\u00e1ndez Denton ruled.</p> <p>So far, that has not happened. An access road through the middle of the building site is closed to all but construction traffic and an armed police officer at the fort's locked gates turns away anyone who gets too close.</p> <p>\"This is public land that belongs to the people of Puerto Rico and what is happening here is illegal,\" said Benito Reinosa, 77, an activist who joins the protest most days. \"We were a small group but we have grown as people became aware of what was going on. We'll keep fighting until these buildings are demolished.\"</p> <p>Madero, meanwhile, maintains that his company, Lema Developers, has acted properly throughout. The protesters, he has said, have nothing to do with the environment and would oppose development of any kind.</p> <p>The conflict turned violent last year when a small group of construction workers attacked the camp, Reinosa said, because they were angry over losing pay when a lone protester held up building work for two weeks by climbing a crane.</p> <p>\"It's incredible that the authorities haven't permanently closed the camp and even more incredible that they allow the protesters to stop [our] work,\" said Glory Cruz, spokeswoman for Trabajadores Pro Ambiente y Empleo (workers for the environment and employment).</p> <p>Dr Antonio Fern\u00f3s, a lawyer and author whose book - From San Ger\u00f3nimo to Paseo Caribe - chronicles the history the development from its planning stage , said the legal challenges would continue. </p> <p>\"These lands were public under the Spanish crown, and were treated as such when they were ceded to the United States in 1898 and then to the people of Puerto Rico in 1929,\" he said. \"This is the looting of a cultural treasure.\"</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p>San Ger\u00f3nimo and the larger San Antonio fort along the San Juan islet were crucial to the successful Spanish defence of the city against a 1797 British invasion. Puerto Rico was ceded to the US after the Spanish-American War of 1898, and became a self-governing territory of the US in 1947. The San Ger\u00f3nimo fort, owned by the Puerto Rico government, is in the care of the Caribe Hilton hotel.</p>",
  "<p>The chairman of France's most popular savings bank quit last night after a \u20ac600m derivatives trading scandal that shook confidence in a financial system already rocked by global turmoil.</p> <p>Charles Milhaud, who had been in charge of mutual bank Caisse d'Epargne since 1999, issued a statement after a marathon meeting of the supervisory board explaining he had resigned. Two of his most senior colleagues - director general Nicolas Merindol and head of risk and finance Julien Carmona - were also reported to have left their posts. </p> <p>\"This loss is the result of the exceptional volatility of the markets during this period and the breach of instructions that the board and I gave,\" Milhaud, 65, said in a written statement. </p> <p>\"I accept full responsibility, however. Having devoted my entire life to the Caisse d'Epargne, I have never at any moment considered trying to avoid my responsibilities.\"</p> <p>News of the derivatives 'incident', which occurred on October 6 as share markets were crashing as a result of the global crisis, prompted widespread anger among savers and politicians. In an action reminiscent of J\u00e9r\u00f4me Kerviel's \u20ac4.9bn scandal at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, a small group of traders is believed to have taken bigger than authorised bets on equity-linked derivatives, leaving Caisse d'Epargne with a \u20ac600m hole. </p> <p>President Nicolas Sarkozy made no secret of his wish to see heads roll at the bank, which is in the process of merging with Banque Populaire to become France's second-largest retail bank. </p> <p>Speaking from an EU-Canada summit he warned chiefs they must 'face the consequences' of their actions after an 'unacceptable' loss. \"Everything points to an absurd lack of responsibility,\" he said. \"I have said that in this crisis, everyone must assume their responsibilities, regardless of their position.\"</p> <p>Milhaud, the latest in a growing line of scalps to be claimed by the global turbulence, said last night he would not be taking any leaving payment. </p> <p>\"Those who know me know I am not a man of money,\" he said. \"I am not asking for any idemnity.\" </p> <p>Sources said last night that Bernard Comolet, chairman of the bank's regional operations, would replace him at the helm of the bank popularly known in France as 'the squirrel'.</p> <p>Loved by small-scale savers, Caisse d'Epargne has 27 million account holders and employs 51,500 people. Officials at the bank were quick to insist that the loss did not affect its stability.</p>",
  "<p>A few weeks ago speculation began as to what might be the novels of the credit crunch. Where was the F Scott Fitzgerald, John Steinbeck or Martin Amis of 2008, the novelist who could speak to this crazily chaotic economic age? On cue last week, Aravind Adiga wins the Booker for The White Tiger. The critics have been sniffy, referring to him with discernible disdain as a former journalist. (He was Asia business correspondent for Time magazine.) But he won precisely because of his ringside seat at globalisation's boom years; he won because, despite its possible shortcomings as a novel, his book nails the myth of a benign US economic hegemony that has \"lifted\" millions out of poverty across Asia. </p> <p>What it portrays in its place is horrific: a world where billions live in what Adiga's lead character describes as the \"Darkness\" - the abject poverty entrenched across swaths of rural and slum-city India. Meanwhile, an elite surfing on a tide of consumerism and cheap credit has been entirely dislocated from the majority of the country. This is a country where Bangalore's IT millionaires grow rich alongside an agrarian crisis characterised by an extraordinary phenomenon, the silent protests of 18,000 indebted farmers committing suicide every year - 200,000 in the past 12 years.</p> <p>Just as Steinbeck stirred the conscience of America with his novels on the dust bowl and the Great Depression, and Charles Dickens challenged the complacencies of Victorian Britain, so Adiga reads as a blistering critique of an economic system that can only be described as grotesque. The Indian economist Jayati Ghosh points out that Mumbai has the second biggest sales globally of Mercedes cars, yet more than half of India lives in poverty without enough to eat.</p> <p>The pertinence of Adiga's win is that India has been the poster boy for the past two decades of globalisation; Bono told me once that he dreamed of sub-Saharan Africa finding a way to emulate India's success. But its model of growth imported from the US was based on credit-fuelled consumerism for a fifth of the population while state investment in health, education, agriculture, infrastructure - crucial components of sustainable development - were cut back. Adiga's novel is a powerful volley in the crisis of legitimacy gripping the west's domination of the global economy. </p> <p>Europe and the US have spent the weekend talking of reform of global capitalism and a Bretton Woods II, but they need to start with a grovelling apology. In recent decades, they have used their power through the IMF to write the rules and impose them across the world by ruthless manipulation and bullying. Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have together more votes in the IMF than China, India and Brazil. </p> <p>In the past month, the US and Europe have been humiliated by the catastrophic failure of their own rules, and have been forced to rip them up. The double standards of western interests have been starkly exposed - their bail-outs are exactly what they have refused, repeatedly, to allow other countries to do in similar crises. </p> <p>Those who will pay the heaviest price for the foolhardiness of deregulated financial capitalism are among those who are least responsible, as Brazil's President Lula angrily pointed out last week. The shockwaves of the west's banking crisis will shipwreck more vulnerable countries. In developing countries, people don't have the resources - welfare provision, savings, insurance - to tide them over a crisis. Instead, they go hungry, homeless - and they die. Across Africa and Asia, countries are bracing themselves for multiple hits, with falls in aid already threatened and a likely decline in the remittances that buoy up their economies - in the UK, the immigration minister Phil Woolas is already signalling a harder line on immigration. Fear of global recession is bringing commodity prices down and will reduce the demand for luxury products such as flowers, green beans and hot holidays. The anger among developing countries will spread. Our worries about jobs and pensions pale in comparison with the fallout on the billions who will not be able to feed or educate their children. </p> <p>The western model of neoliberal financialisation was driven by clear self-interest, argues the Cambridge economist Ha-Joon Chang. The west couldn't compete in manufacturing (its labour costs are too high), so it turned to financial markets and used the cheapest way to make money: it offered loans, not for productive investment (factories, businesses) but to consumers, using their homes as collateral. Credit cards and small loans are particularly lucrative. So the west leaned heavily on countries through the World Trade Organisation and the IMF to open up their financial sectors. The western banks and the advertising companies piled in, and the result is a credit consumer boom. This may make a few people rich, but it is not, by any definition, development.</p> <p>Chang, South Korean by background, saw the bullying graphically illustrated in the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis. Not only did the US and the IMF stop the Asian countries from implementing a state bail-out, they took advantage of the desperate situation to force South Korea and other Asian nations to adopt further financial deregulation. Productive investment in South Korea has since halved and credit has boomed. Now the country is on economists' critical list as its stockmarket plunges. Ironically, it is only the countries lucky enough to have dodged IMF bullying who are relatively safe in the current maelstrom: leftwing political groups in India closed ranks to protect its banking sector from the worst deregulation. </p> <p>For most developing countries, the moral of the 1997-98 Asian crisis was that a primary purpose of financial management was to ensure sufficient capital reserves to avoid ever being vulnerable to the IMF thugs in their pinstripe suits. India, Korea, China: all have huge foreign reserves, often in US treasury bonds. It is the safest form of insurance in a global economy in which the flows of foreign exchange are so huge they can destroy a currency in of hours. But for a developing country to tie up most of its capital abroad is ruinously expensive; this capital should be invested in the country's own development - roads, for example, and schools to produce engineers, scientists and IT technicians. </p> <p>Once again, who benefits from this absurdity of the global financial system? The west - in particular the US, whose current account deficit is funded by the sacrificed futures of millions across Asia. Chang's thesis, in his book Bad Samaritans - Guilty Secrets of Rich Nations and the Threat to Global Prosperity, is that the west has effectively kicked away the ladder that enabled it to achieve prosperity. It denies to developing countries the protection and the investment in industries that were essential to its own development. </p> <p>At its most stark, the analysis is that the west has had a vested interest in keeping wage levels down in developing countries while making money from offering cheap credit. All it had to do was enlist a collaborating elite in each country to implement the deal, which was clearly not in the interests of the bulk of the population. Neoliberal globalisation was a system that ensured the rich got richer and the poor got poorer.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:m.bunting@theguardian.com\">m.bunting@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Have you seen Keira Knightley in The Duchess? What about Daniel Day-Lewis in There Will Be Blood? Do you agree that one is beautiful and the other pretty? I'm not talking about the beauty that emanates from a person's soul. No, I'm being strictly superficial. Day-Lewis has a beautiful face and a wonderful figure. Knightley has a pretty face and a size-below-zero figure. You can't even call it boyish. It's boyish-ish. </p> <p>Must I, at this point, declare my sexuality, so we all know where we are and exactly what I want to do to Daniel? There's no need. If I mention the beauty of another man, it's obvious - I must be gay. OK, I'm a husband and father, but when did that tell you anything? Why would I go to such lengths to prove I'm straight unless I were a gay man in denial? I must be gay because male beauty isn't openly celebrated in our society by men, unless they are gay. </p> <p>All I want is equality with women. When women write about female beauty, their sexuality is never in question. It's open season for all women - gay, straight, old, young, gorgeous, ugly, bitter - to bang on about each other's hair, lips, eyes, cheeks, neck, breasts, stomach, legs, thighs, feet, nails, clothes and make-up. They do it publicly and behind each other's backs. They do it fearlessly. </p> <p>From a recent edition of the Times - the Times! - I learned that Catherine Zeta-Jones had misapplied her facial bronzer prior to her appearance at the United Nations global leadership awards. Ooh, bitch! But wait: the column was called not Ugliness Police, but Beauty Surgery. In other words, the column was caring. It was designed to heal the (involuntary) patient. On the subject of female beauty, women get away with caring murder. </p> <p>That was the secret of Trinny and Susannah. They would literally womanhandle a victim's bosom on national television, with the aim of bringing that bosom up to their level. Because they cared. They were doing it for that bosom's own good. If only, they sighed, that bosom could find a better-fitting bra. Consider the male equivalent, and picture Jeremy Clarkson on Top Gear, lifting and separating another man's testicles to convince him that, with more supportive underpants, they would hang more pleasingly and chafe less in an emergency stop.</p> <p>Women are fearless. Men are silent. In my experience, men never talk about each other's appearance, either behind each other's backs or face to face and testicles to testicles. It's as if the male body is invisible to other males whereas, in fact, most male bodies get more visible by the year, as the belly oozes over the belt like a suet pudding boiling over a saucepan rim. I have yet to meet a man who looks me up and down for cosmetic, corporeal and fashion lapses - even though I live in the countryside, where dressing badly is de rigueur. (Have you ever met anyone who works for \"a leading Suffolk fashion house\"?) My wife, on the other hand, constantly meets look-you-up-and-down women. Why, you might wonder, would I want parity with her? </p> <p>The answer's simple. With women there's bitchiness, but there's solidarity too. Look no further than Twiggy's Frock Exchange, currently running on BBC2. It's a highly entertaining half-hour programme (which, unfortunately, runs for an hour) in which a hundred women gather to swap clothes. What is so striking, apart from its timely thriftiness, is the praise and reassurance these women are given by Twiggy and her co-presenters, who maintain a constant state of gurgling benevolence. The women look \"fantastic\", they look \"gorgeous\", they look \"amazing\". One woman's legs are \"awesome\". </p> <p>That is the kind of love-in a man like me craves. Let me walk among the middle-aged spreaders on Yentob's Shirt Exchange, in which a hundred blokes, all in black Levi's and white T-shirts, pointlessly swap their clothes and are told by Alan Yentob that their bellies look \"awesome\". Male obesity might shrink to nothing if men showed that degree of bodily kinship with their fellow men. Bring on the male supermodels, to whose condition we can all aspire: Kurt Moss, Claud Schiffer, Angus Deyn, Tel Macpherson, Norm E Campbell, Len Da-Evangelista. And now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going for a jog. </p> <p>\u2022 Jon Canter is a novelist and scriptwriter <br><a href=\"mailto:jcanter@waitrose.com\">jcanter@waitrose.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Economic remedies for the fiscal crisis continue to frustrate their political backers. On that black Monday when the US Congress refused to pass the $700bn bail-out, the market plummeted 477 points. A few days later, after Congress reversed itself and passed the $700bn bail-out, the market dropped nearly 800 points. Since then it has gyrated wildly, drawing markets in Britain, continental Europe and Asia into the maelstrom. What's going on - a crisis in economic capital or in fiscal confidence?</p> <p>Neither exactly. As the global hysteria makes evident, trust is at stake, but not purely fiscal or economic trust. De-leveraging banks, insuring deposit accounts, penalising CEOs and socialising risk can't do the trick because trust is ultimately political - more specifically, democratic. Trust is a crucial form of social capital, a recognition of the common ground on which we stand as citizens. It is the glue that holds rival producers and consumers together and lets them do the business that would otherwise do them in. Whereas the whole point of the market is competition - selfishness and narcissism as instruments of market calculation. </p> <p>The dirty little secret is, however, that market capitalism works only when it can feed parasitically off active democratic social capital. When too many mortgages fail and too many banks come under pressure and too much bad paper gets sold and too many hedge funds don't realise what they've bought, and credit freezes up and stocks tumble, the trust deficit appears. And no amount of fiscal tinkering, government pushing, banking reform, resolute de-leveraging or presidential and ministerial rhetoric can make up for this democratic deficit.</p> <p>Because the secret of the invisible hand is not economic capital but social capital. Adam Smith knew that moral sentiments no less than capital markets undergird the wealth of nations. The liquidity crisis is a political crisis; the credit deficit is a democratic deficit. For trust is the social capital that permits private capital to be exchanged, contracts to be enforced, promises to be kept, expectations to be realised. Democracy is the common sea in which all those competing market boats and bickering fiscal sailors are kept afloat.</p> <p>So although it was bad loans and greedy bankers and stupid hedge fund managers and ignorant investors who made the mess, it has been four decades of de-democratisation that has done the real damage. A haemorrhaging of social capital that nobody noticed because government was supposed to be the problem and markets the solution. Runaway Thatcherism and exuberant Reaganism railed against government until citizens were literally talked out of their democracy.</p> <p>Government was allegedly the villain, but government was just democracy's tool - not always very efficient and often insufficiently accountable, but democracy's tool nonetheless. And democracy's real product was trust. As the war on government became a war on democracy, it drew down the well of social capital and eroded trust, causing citizens to lose faith in each other and their power to govern themselves. Why now should consumers trust banks? Or bankers trust one another? Or investors trust the stock market? Or anyone at all trust the prime minister or the US president or his treasury secretary or the MPs and members of Congress who don't trust their own leadership?</p> <p>Trust is at once both precious and precarious, foundational but fragile. No leveraging without trust. No housing market without faith. No stock market without fidelity. No international trade without confidence. All products of social capital, all victims of the \"cash nexus\" that Marx associated with capitalism's essence. For capitalism is rooted in selfishness and cold calculating self-interest and necessarily dedicated to the welfare of shareholders rather than common goods, and it thus is incapable of generating the trust on which it depends. The way out of the crisis demands more than propping up banks or pumping billions into the frozen credit market. It means consumers must also be citizens if contracts, promises and mortgages are to be honoured.</p> <p>The lesson? The remedy today lies not simply in de-leveraging but in re-democratising. Recreate social capital and trust will follow. Then, and only then, will markets calm and lenders lend again, investors invest again, consumers buy homes again, and - with the private economy once more subordinated to the public good - prosperity again become possible, disciplined by civic faith and democratic justice.</p> <p>\u2022 Benjamin Barber is the author of Consumed: How Markets Corrupt Children, Infantilize Adults and Swallow Citizens Whole <a href=\"http://www.benjaminbarber.com\">benjaminbarber.com</a></p>",
  "<p>When the latest Rajar figures were released last week there was more concern than usual for the health of digital stations - with those who had already ploughed millions into the medium looking for reassurance that DAB radio still has the capability to flourish, following Channel 4's decision to ditch its digital radio project. </p> <p>Fortunately, the research showed that digital listening is indeed in fine fettle. Between July and September, digital platforms accounted for 18.7% of all radio listening - for the previous quarter the figure was 17.9%; for the same period last year it was 15%. And despite their digital woes, it was commercial services that led the DAB charge; 19.4% of adults listen to a commercial service via digital means every week, with 9.8% listening via a digital radio and 6.8% listening via a digital television.</p> <p>Planet Rock, the only national DAB service to escape GCap's cuts earlier in the year, continued to improve under independent management, with 633,000 listeners and nearly 5m listening hours, while Bauer's revamped Q Radio broke through the million hours barrier, reporting 330,000 listeners. </p> <p>The first Rajars for DX-Media-owned NME produced a healthy 215,000 pairs of ears, and Bauer's The Hits recorded an audience of 1.59 million.</p> <p>Overall, commercial radio fared well in the last quarter. Although the BBC continued to dominate, attracting 55.5% of all radio listening, the commercial sector improved its market share for the second quarter in a row, up to 42.4% - an increase of 2% since March. RadioCentre, the body that represents commercial radio, puts this improvement down to the \"relaxed regulation\" that has seen groups implement significant changes, most notably the introduction of daytime networking and reductions in speech output.</p> <p>More than 25 million adults are now tuning into a local commercial station every week, but not every local station was celebrating on Thursday. </p> <p>Bauer's Metro Radio in Newcastle saw its lowest reach, total hours and market share since 1999, when Rajar introduced the current methodology for audience measurement, while Global Radio's BRMB in Birmingham posted a record low of just 381,000 listeners, from a population of more than 2 million.</p> <p>So RadioCentre's argument that commercial radio is gaining ground thanks to cutting corners is hardly conclusive yet - particularly when other developments in local marketplaces are considered. </p> <p>Five years ago, BBC Local Radio began aggressively targeting a younger audience at the expense of its older listeners. These stations have since lost nearly 23m hours of listening; the average time spent listening to a local BBC station every week has dropped by almost 18%; and their collective market share has fallen by nearly a fifth.</p> <p>While BBC bosses would argue that the right type of listener is more important than volume of listeners, BBC Southern Counties has shed almost a third of its total listening hours in three months. BBC stations may now be competing directly for the listeners of many commercial stations - but are they creating output people want to listen to?</p> <p>The BBC's national stations fared better, according to its press release at least. \"Radios 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 live all showed increases in reach year-on-year,\" whooped the top line. All very exciting, unless you consider the total time audiences spent listening every week. Every one of those stations lost listening hours quarter-on-quarter - between the five services, listeners tuned in for more than 12.5m fewer hours than in the previous quarter.</p> <p>Thankfully, digital radio performed well for the BBC, too. Spoken word service BBC 7 (now renamed BBC Radio 7) continued to push towards the 1 million mark, with 887,000 listeners. And finally 1Xtra gained some momentum in attracting an audience of 600,000, while both BBC 6 Music and 5 Live Sports Extra displayed increases in reach.</p> <p>All stations in the BBC's digital portfolio, with the exception of the Asian Network, posted increases in audience and listening hours. Taken together with the success of their commercial counterparts, this suggests that reports of DAB's death may be premature.</p>",
  "<p>At the cocktail parties and bistros of Cannes last week, all anyone at the annual Mipcom programme market wanted to talk about was the economy. But the difference between the TV executives on the C\u00f4te d'Azur and the bankers and lawyers having the same conversation elsewhere was the glint of optimism. Sipping champagne, more than one TV executive said that when the economy goes down the pan, people turn to home entertainment to cheer themselves up. </p> <p>\"Depression time is a good time for entertainment programming,\" says Rob Clark, vice-president of worldwide entertainment and production for FremantleMedia, home of The X Factor and Britain's Got Talent. \"People don't want to go home and be clobbered with dreary stuff.\"</p> <p>There is no denying that parts of the TV industry have already found themselves in the mire because of the downturn. A slump in ad revenues has prompted Channel 4 to axe up to 150 jobs and slash its \u00a3600m programme budget by \u00a325m, while ITV is cutting 1,000 posts. </p> <p>But Paul Richards, a media analyst at Numis Securities, says he expects Sky to post a jump of 74,000 subscribers when it reports figures for the latest quarter at the end of the month. \"BSkyB is one of the areas that holds up well in a downturn,\" he says. \"If you are going out less, you are watching TV more.\" The Sex and the City movie DVD shifted nearly 1m copies in its first week of release last month, and rental firm Lovefilm has reported a 40% jump in business since the credit crunch began.</p> <p>There was no apparent slackening in the number of deals being done in Cannes. Indeed, with many broadcasters cutting their budgets for original programming, acquired shows and repeats have suddenly become more important in filling the schedules.</p> <p>Even though there is less money to go round, production companies are still making money on repeats, says Don Taffner Jr, president of My Family producer DLT Entertainment. \"Producers are often losing money on productions because they are producing less shows or budgets are tighter, but we make up for it through broadcasters repeating shows,\" he says.</p> <p>\"That helps mitigate things ... Broadcasters still have to put shows on the air. And there will be more people watching because it is 'free' to do so.\" BBC Worldwide is one of Mipcom's biggest sellers and the division's managing director of sales and distribution, Steve Macallister, says that business has been as good as ever, adding that when broadcasters cut shows, they want to replace them with those of a similar quality. </p> <p>\"We find that even in so-called quiet times like this, we have got an absolutely packed stand,\" he says.\"Broadcasters are being a little bit more cautious, but based on our experience from previous cycles like this, people who cut production budgets are still acquiring programming. People want to buy content which is reliable and is a known and trusted brand.\"</p> <p>While the economic downturn is good news for programme sellers, it seems also to be positive for those making comedy and entertainment shows. British-based firm FremantleMedia, also behind American Idol, has presented a range of entertainment programmes to buyers, including the dating format Take Me Out, picked up as a pilot by C4. A new generation of Japanese gameshows are also high on the agenda following the success of BBC1's Hole in the Wall. All Star Athletics has two teams go head to head in a series of competitive events, while To the Limit features everyday tasks taken to the extreme. British broadcasters are said to have shown interest in both.</p> <p>FremantleMedia's chief executive, Tony Cohen, warned that his firm - responsible for three of the top 10 global TV formats - would \"not be immune\" from a recession but said it had experience of weathering economic downturns, such as the one that followed 9/11 in 2001.</p> <p>During the 2001 downturn, advertising revenues fell steeply until 2003 with programme budgets coming under pressure. However, following that period the industry saw the rise of the \"super-indies\" - firms which grew quickly by snapping up their rivals. Today, it is much more consolidated, but despite the tightening of the credit markets, the big firms haven't yet sated their appetite for expansion. Cohen said the company intended to spend \"a lot more\" money on development as well as investing further in talent.</p> <p>Creating new ideas is the lifeblood of the TV industry. TwoFour Broadcast, which made Noel's HQ for Sky1, has had a pilot commissioned by an unnamed broadcaster based around the downturn. </p> <p>The \"location-based entertainment show\" looks at excess spending in a \"non-preaching kind of way\", says managing director Melanie Leach. \"It is about the fact we have all spent too much money. It just felt like the right idea at the right time. It is our response to the credit crunch.\" Leach adds that the firm pitched the idea when the economy first started to turn and it was enthusiastically greeted by broadcasters. A new genre of programming has emerged - thrift shows, such as Twiggy's Frock Exchange on BBC2, Channel Five's money-saving series It Pays to Watch and C4's Gok Wan's Fashion Fix, which aims to prove \"you don't need a fortune to look fabulous\".</p> <p>But as well as stimulating new ideas, the downturn is making others seem outdated. With house prices collapsing, property shows, such as Channel 4's Property Ladder, increasingly look like a remnant from a distant past. \"I don't think property will ever be off air, but it needs a different approach,\" says Leach. \"Property investment shows are over.\"</p> <p>Maverick TV, the maker of C4's How to Look Good Naked, has just been commissioned by BBC2 to make Brand New Home, about redesigning homes. Other new BBC property shows include Axe the Agent, on the merits of selling property without an estate agent, and Buy It, Sell It, Bank It, which will look at auctions. </p> <p>The producers of Location, Location, Location have had a reality check too - they will air a feature-length special looking at the credit crunch and what homeowners can do about it next month. But the downturn has put paid to a Location, Location, Location property website.</p> <p>The funding of shows is also set to change with the days of plentiful cash now over. \"Broadcasters are looking for more low-cost formats,\" Leach says. \"Two years ago, you couldn't make shows expensive enough - now, everyone wants to know how cheap you can make them. </p> <p>Lee Bartlett, the new managing director of ITV Global Content, the broadcaster's production arm, says he wants to see longer runs of dramas in order to create better efficiences of scale. Bartlett, who is American, previously worked at the US networks ABC and Fox, where 22-episode dramas are the norm. In the UK, making six episodes is more usual. </p> <p>\"UK broadcasters currently commission six episodes and if the show is successful, they commission a second series,\" he says. \"By the time they do that, they've shut down production and have to relaunch production, rehire crews and on-camera talent which costs a lot more than producing 13 episodes continuously. There is also additional market spend so that the audience knows the show is back.\"</p> <p>He says he aims to film drama series much closer to their transmission dates, so that if a show debuts successfully, it can be extended more cheaply. The new model would need star writers to work in teams rather than by themselves as usually happens, but the idea is already understood to have the support of ITV director of television Peter Fincham. \"It's about maintaining quality while making production smarter,\" Bartlett says. \"And if I do that, then to a certain extent I am doing it cheaper at the same time as adding value.\"</p> <p>Long-running BBC1 comedy My Family is one of the few UK shows that uses team writing, but Taffner Jr says he expects the downturn to encourage more production companies to use the model.</p> <p>With less money in the system, new business models for production must be found. One scheme used by the BBC is set to be extended to C4, according to insiders. The initiative sees banks, such as Barclays and the Bank of Ireland, loan the production costs of some shows to producers so they don't appear on the BBC's balance sheet in a particular year. The BBC then pays the loan back in a different financial year, helping to spread its costs.</p> <p>Despite credit drying up for many industries, the fact that TV is seen as a relatively safe bet - particularly the BBC - was reflected in the number of bankers in Cannes wooing producers at champagne parties. Yet the nature of the deals has changed. Programme distributor DCD Rights, part of DCD Media which owns UK companies such as youth producer Done and Dusted, came to Mipcom with a new funding model - a \u00a310m private equity pot to invest in programming. \"The people who used to come to Cannes to invest highly leveraged sums like $200m in big deals are now looking to do smaller deals, because the credit is no longer there,\" says DCD Media chief executive Chris Hunt. \"People...are getting more inventive about how to make their money work.\"</p> <p><strong><br>Re-programming for the credit crunch</strong><br><strong>11am BBC1.

  "<p>Byron wrote that \"I think it great affectation not to quote oneself.\" On that basis, I'd like to quote what I wrote in a piece about the City of London, in the aftermath of the Northern Rock fiasco: \"If our laws are not extended to control the new kinds of super-powerful, super-complex and potentially super-risky investment vehicles, they will one day cause a financial disaster of global-systemic proportions.\"</p> <p>The prediction was right, but the tense was wrong. The disaster had already happened, it just hadn't yet played itself out. It is doing so now, though. The recipe is starting to become well known, but perhaps it's worth spelling it out one more time. Financial institutions in the US lent money to people with poor credit histories. This wasn't a bad thing in itself - indeed it could be seen as an example of capitalism at its most beneficently creative. The invention that made it possible for the lending to become reckless was securitisation: the process by which loans were added together and sold on to other institutions as packages of debt. This had the effect of making the initial lender indifferent to whether or not the loan could be repaid. These packages of debt were then resold in the form of horrendously complex financial instruments, and it is these that are the basis of the global jamming-up of capital markets. The overlapping loans are so complicated that no one knows who owns what underlying debt, and, furthermore, no one knows what these assets are worth. (If you own someone else's debt, it counts as an asset.) The mechanism for assessing the value of these assets is the market: they are worth what someone is prepared to pay. At the moment, because no one is buying, no one has a clue what they're worth, if anything. Because of an accountancy practice called \"mark to market\", requiring that assets be listed at their current values, this fact had to be reflected in the companies' balance sheets - so these balance sheets suddenly looked disastrous. As a result, banks are reluctant to lend to each other, and the entire financial system has ground to a halt: such capital as is moving in the markets is supplied by the central banks, which have to date pumped in hundreds of billions of dollars to generate some liquidity.</p> <p>The scorecard began with Northern Rock, done in by Britain's first bank run in 150 years. The bank was a demutualised former mutual society. It had adopted a groovy, go-go financial strategy: only 27% of its funds came from money deposited by savers; the rest came from short-term borrowing from the international money markets. When they choked up, the Rock sought emergency funding from the Bank of England, which acted too slowly and triggered the run, which led to its nationalisation on February 17.</p> <p>Note that the Rock wasn't destroyed by risky lending. Some of its loans were risky: a banker told me that there was trouble with a \"book\" of mortgage loans for 120% of the value of homes. But what ruined the bank was its exposure to the now malfunctioning money markets.</p> <p>Next to go was the US investment bank Bear Stearns. This bank had too great an exposure to sub-prime debt; investors fled, the share price collapsed, and on 16 March the bank was bought by its competitor JP Morgan, its market value having declined from $20bn to $236m. The US government underwrote the purchase by providing a guarantee of $29bn against the bank's mortgage liabilities, in order to make the rest of the bank viable for purchase. It did so because it was worried about the risk to the the banking system if Bear Stearns collapsed.</p> <p>Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were more directly done in by bad loans. These odd institutions are/were a hybrid, with capital drawn from shareholders but underwriting from the US government: their function was to underwrite the mortgages given by other institutions, and to provide liquidity to the mortgage markets. They are \"government sponsored enterprises\" whose deposits are not guaranteed by the government, a fact nobody believed, since it was generally felt certain that if Fannie and Freddie ever got into trouble, the government would have to bail them out. That assumption turned out to be correct. After the collapse in US house prices and the soaring default rate of mortgages, Freddie and Fannie, with mortgage-backed securities worth $5 trillion and debt of $1.6 trillion, were on the verge of going under, and they were taken into \"conservatorship\" by the US government on September 7.</p> <p>The term \"conservatorship\" fails to mask the fact that this was, by cash value, the biggest nationalisation in history. It was followed eight days later by the largest bankruptcy in history, when the investment bank Lehman Brothers went into Chapter 11, the American form of receivership. Lehman had an impressive $613bn of debt, but some parts of its various businesses were viable: it was the holding company that went broke, leaving the subsidiary businesses free to be sold off. The main one, the US investment banking arm, was bought by Barclays for $250m, with another $1.5bn for buildings and data centres. Oh, and $2.5bn in bonuses that would be paid for the bank's New York staff. The previous year, Lehman's bonuses were $5.7bn.</p> <p>If you are wondering how a total of $8,200,000,000 could be paid in bonuses over two years to the great minds whose company went bankrupt, what can I tell you? The bonus question is often seen as a tragicomic footnote to the business of banking, but it may be close to the heart of the problem. Through history, great fortunes have been made by people directly taking risks on their own account. Today, great fortunes are made by employees, doing nothing other than their jobs: jobs which, in the case of bankers, involve taking on risks, usually with other people's borrowed money. To make more money, and earn more bonuses (which are usually 60% of an investment banker's pay), it's simple: you just take on more risk. The upside is the upside, and the downside - well, it increasingly seems that for the bankers themselves, certainly in the case of Lehman New York, there isn't one. This undermines the whole principle of \"moral hazard\", which was the idea behind letting Lehman go under in the first place - the need for companies to face the consequences of their decisions. This principle obviously collapses if the individuals involved don't face any consequences.</p> <p>By allowing Lehman to go under, the US Treasury seemed to be making the point that, where possible, it would allow the market to take its course. The markets reacted with horror. It is now received wisdom that it was the US government's willingness to let Lehman Brothers fail that triggered the meltdown, by causing fear to become panic. The day after the biggest bankruptcy in history saw the biggest bail-out of a private company in history, with the US government taking a 79.9% share in the insurer AIG in return for a loan facility of $85bn. AIG was exposed to a lot of bad loans, and was valuing its mortgage securities at 1.7 to two times as much as Lehman had valued its. So if Lehman was broke, AIG was in an even worse position.</p> <p>The spectacular scale of these implosions masked what would otherwise have been a gigantic story: Merrill Lynch being taken over by the Bank of America on September 14, after a year of huge losses linked to sub-prime mortgages. On September 21, Goldman Sachs, the world's biggest investment bank, and Morgan Stanley converted their legal status from investment banks to holding banks, a change which allowed them access to help from the Federal Reserve in return for a greatly increased level of government supervision. Goldman had done all right in the initial phases of the credit crunch, but the general turn against banking stocks nonetheless did for its status as an investment bank. That means that in the past months the five biggest investment banks in New York - Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley - have ceased to exist as investment banks. On September 25 came the largest bank failure in American history, as Washington Mutual (WaMu) went into receivership following a bank run during which its customers withdrew $16.7bn in 10 days.</p> <p>Taking all these superlatives together, it is easy to see why the Federal Reserve and the US Treasury (run by Hank Paulson, former head of Goldman Sachs) decided to step in. The idea is to buy up the toxic assets which are poisoning the banking system, so that the banks can go back to lending money to each other. They must have known that the initial plan wouldn't pass unamended: it was only three pages long and the only power it didn't grant Paulson was the right to call himself God-King Hank the First. After being knocked back by the House of Representatives, it hit the floor of the Senate at 451 pages, passed, and then was passed in its amended form by the House. It is a strange document, crammed with tax cuts and pork and populist gestures but at its heart allowing Paulson to buy any \"troubled assets\" he likes, at any price he sees fit.</p> <p>It is going to be interesting to see if the bail-out works. The usual model for a crisis of this scale is for the state to take over the troubled institutions, then go through the books separating the good from the bad assets, and selling them off, part one and then part two. The bail-out is an attempt to do part two of that without doing part one, no doubt because the problem is so big that part one would involve the nationalisation of the entire US banking system. The socialisation of US banking would be a hell of a punchline to decades of unfettered liberal capitalism. As it stands, the plan is socialism for the rich.</p> <p>The British and European scorecard seemed, at the start, less spectacular. On 18 September, news of the biggest bank merger - carefully not denominated a takeover - in British history: Lloyds was to buy HBOS, the largest mortgage lender in the UK, with 20% of the market. HBOS had taken on a disproportionate share of the newer, riskier mortgages, and also was only 58% funded by depositors, the rest of its funds coming from the wholesale markets; a much safer ratio than the 27% of depositor funding held by Northern Rock, but still enough for the share price to collapse and induce a takeover. On September 28, the Luxembourg, Belgian and Dutch governments nationalised the bank Fortis, the biggest private employer in Belgium, at a cost of \u20ac11.2bn, after its share price collapsed. </p> <p>On September 29, Bradford &amp; Bingley (another demutualised former building society), which had the largest share of the buy-to-let market, was nationalised, at a cost of \u00a341.3bn, and its branch network sold off to the Spanish bank Santander - the classic part one, part two model. On September 30, the Icelandic government nationalised the country's third largest bank, Giltnir. Iceland's second biggest bank, Landsbanki, followed on October 7 and its biggest, Kaupthing, on October 9. The Icelandic government would not guarantee overseas depositors' money, including nearly \u00a31bn of UK local government cash. This caused the British to use anti-terrorism legislation to freeze Landsbanki's assets in the UK. The German commercial property loan giant Hypo Real Estate was bailed out on 5 October at a cost of \u20ac50bn. At the same time the German government blurted out that it was guaranteeing the deposits of all savers, a bizarre thing to do given that the previous day it had criticised the Irish government for doing the same thing. It became obvious that the absence of a European equivalent of the Fed - able to impose a consistent Eurozone policy - is a huge strategic problem for the EU.</p> <p>The markets went into freefall - especially banking shares. On October 7, HBOS and Lloyds both lost 40% of their value. A total collapse seemed possible. In the early hours of October 8, the British government announced that it was forcing the eight biggest banks to increase their levels of capitalisation, and offering to provide them the money to do that, in return for \"preference shares\". These are a last-in-first-out type of shareholding, without voting rights or a link to the share price. First, though, the object of the exercise is to prevent further systemic meltdown, and, to that end, the government offered another \u00a3200bn of short-term loans: the kind of loan whose absence is at the heart of the current freeze-up. The government is also offering \u00a3250bn of loan guarantees to back loans between the banks. It is a partial form of nationalisation, and constitutes the biggest move ever to shore up the UK banking system. At the same time, six central banks - in the US, UK, EU, Sweden, Switzerland and Canada - cut interest rates by 0.5%, and China cut rates by 0.27%.</p> <p>Will it work? Let's hope so. No other government has, at the time of writing, moved as boldly and systematically as the British, and the government clearly hopes that these huge new moves will bring the market to its senses, and allow us to have a good old-fashioned recession, rather than a full-scale depression. One of the problems is that our big banks aren't just big, they're huge: the four biggest each have a capital value of more than \u00a31 trillion. Add the five biggest together, and the sum is four times the value of Britain's GDP. Our (remaining) banks have less exposure to the famous toxic debt than their US counterparts, but while the wholesale money markets aren't functioning, normal banking life is impossible. They are highly leveraged, too. It was this combination of size and leverage that did for Iceland's banks. The ratio of Barclays' assets to its equity in June hit 61.3 to 1. Imagine that for a moment translated to your own finances, so that you could stretch what you actually own to borrow more than 60 times the amount. (I'd have an island. What about you?) It sounds sensible to reduce that leverage, and indeed it is, except that the process of reducing it is the dreaded \"deleveraging\" that is causing the banking system and the wider economy to grind to a halt. The scale of bank leveraging is one of the things that must be targeted by regulators if/when the crisis has passed; we can't let the banks get this far out of control ever again. There must be a tight limit on the relationship between banks' debt and their equity, and much greater transparency about the nature of banks' \"assets\".</p> <p>So: a huge unregulated boom in which almost all the upside went directly into private hands, followed by a gigantic bust in which the losses were socialised. That is nobody's idea of how the financial system is supposed to work. It is just as much an abomination to the free marketeer as it is to the social democrat or outright leftist. But the alternatives don't seem to be forthcoming: there is a theoretical vacuum where the challenge from the left used to be. Capitalism no longer has a global antagonist, when it has never needed one more - if only to clarify thinking and values, and to provide the chorus of Schadenfreude that at this moment is deeply appropriate. I would be providing it myself if I weren't so frightened.</p> <p>Having fully indulged their greed on the way up, and created the risks, the bankers are now fully indulging their fear on the way down, and allowing the system to seize up. But it wasn't just the banks. One thing that has been lacking in public discourse about the crisis is someone to point out that we did this to ourselves, because we were greedy and stupid. It's not just bankers who have been indulging in greed, short-termism and fantasy economics. In addition to our stretched mortgage borrowing, Britain has half of the total European credit-card debt. We grew obsessed with the price of our houses, felt richer than we should, borrowed money we didn't have, and now that the downturn has happened - as it was bound to do - we want someone else to blame. Bankers are to blame, but we're to blame too. That's just as well, because we're the ones who are going to have to pay.</p> <p>Other than that, it's too early to draw general conclusions from this amazing crisis. What must die is the mystical belief in the power of the markets that has dominated political and economic discourse in most of the western world for the past several decades. The markets have, so flagrantly malfunctioned that we can't go back to the idea of unfettered liberal capitalism as a talisman, template or magic wand. Unquestioned Cityphilia is gone, I hope for ever. Unfortunately, we have no model of where to go from here, apart from a more heavily regulated form of growth-based liberal capitalism. There will be more intrusive regulation, more proactive interference. There may even be (there should be) a new system to control the global flow of capital. That doesn't seem enough, but in the absence of another set of ideas about how the world should work, it may turn out to be what we have to settle for. In the meantime, it's seatbelt sign on, sick bag to hand, and that deep, bitter, prayerful longing for smooth air.</p> <p>\u2022 This is an edited version of an article that appears in the current issue of the London Review of Books (<a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk\">lrb.co.uk</a>)</p>",
  "<p>Last week the eyes of the financial world turned to Britain as the government announced radical action to restore confidence in our banking system, prevent the failure of some of our most important banks and shore up our financial markets against the worst effects of the global financial crisis.</p> <p>I had joined the government just a week before, as part of the team of Treasury ministers led by Alistair Darling. As a new junior minister with a commercial background, I was asked to support discussions that would shape a deal to recapitalise some of our largest banks, inject liquidity into the system and unfreeze the interbank lending market that feeds mortgages and loans to small business.</p> <p>Much media attention focused on the details of these discussions and the subsequent deal. Little attention has yet been given to the wider arguments for such unprecedented action and what it means for our financial system.</p> <p>Action to support banks is not an end in itself. A sound banking system is an essential part of the everyday lives of every family and every business in the country, and an essential precondition for the long-term health of the economy. Yet over the past few weeks the global banking system in effect ceased to function, with the cost at which banks lend to each other reaching an all-time high and the market effectively frozen. If banks stop lending to each other, it is not just banks but families and homeowners that suffer, and many businesses face failure. If the government hadn't taken significant action, the costs to families and businesses would have been far higher.</p> <p>There are three key elements to what was announced last week. The first and most urgent involves providing short-term funds to the financial system, by expanding the Bank of England's special liquidity scheme to at least \u00a3200bn. Second, to put banks on a more secure footing, we have offered to invest directly. Third, to support the lending between banks that feeds new mortgages and loans to businesses, we are providing a credit guarantee to banks that have agreed to raise their capital to a sufficiently high level. We agreed to make investments in RBS, and upon their successful merger, HBOS and Lloyds TSB, totalling \u00a337bn. Five other banks and building societies have committed to raise over \u00a312bn from other sources.</p> <p>In all of these measures we have been guided by three principles: maintaining stability and restoring confidence to our financial system; protecting savers and depositors; and safeguarding the taxpayers' interests. We will manage our investment in banks on a commercial basis and get a commercial return for our support. Any additional borrowing and debt is in return for assets, charged at commercial rates or in the form of temporary loans. And in return for our investment conditions are attached on dividends and bonuses paid to board members and on maintaining the availability of competitively priced lending to homeowners and small businesses.</p> <p>By taking this action now, we can prevent serious risks to the rest of the economy. But significant global challenges remain. So in implementing these measures the government will do whatever else is necessary to stabilise the system, support the economy through these difficult times, and build a strong and stable system for the future.</p> <p>But no country can solve this global crisis on its own. Other countries are now implementing plans similar to ours. It's no surprise. Since 1997, the UK has been at the forefront of reform and innovation in the international community. We were among the first governments to call for greater international cooperation and an early warning system in international financial risk.</p> <p>Collective action should not be restricted to dealing with the consequences of this global crisis - governments also have to act together to prevent future ones. This will require a comprehensive approach. Last week European leaders backed the proposals put forward by the prime minister based on five principles: transparency in relation to risks in the system; absence of conflicts in the system; responsibility of managers for risks they undertake; sound banking practices with respect to risk and capital adequacy; and coordination across borders in recognition of the increasing global nature of markets. Quick progress is needed on all these.</p> <p>It is clear that the global financial system will emerge from this difficult period much changed. But by taking decisive action domestically, and by leading the debate on a new approach internationally, the UK will remain a world leader in financial services. The fundamentals that underpinned our successes over the last decade have not changed - a talented workforce, world-class infrastructure and an internationalism and openness unmatched by other financial centres. These factors will put us on a stronger footing than ever in the newly shaped world of financial services. As City minister, my priority is to bring stability to the system. My ambition is to keep our banks among the strongest in the world. Our economy will welcome it. It deserves nothing less.</p> <p>\u2022 Paul Myners is City minister and former chairman of Guardian Media Group</p>",
  "<p>Until recently, even friends of Gordon Brown scarcely bothered to pretend he had much interest in the environment. Poverty and education, they said, got him out of bed; climate change was something he approached intellectually, not instinctively. Less friendly colleagues would put it more bluntly: the subject bored him rigid. There are welcome signs that the prime minister's preoccupations are shifting. Having developed a taste for financial statesmanship of late, Mr Brown is now said to fancy himself as the man to broker the post-Kyoto framework at the Copenhagen summit next year. A year ago the suggestion would have been laughable; contemporary developments - including Britain's support for investment in carbon capture at today's EU environment council - make it somewhat less so now. But the true test of the new greenery will come closer to home. </p> <p>The personnel problems created by reshuffles are often the explanation for rearrangements of Whitehall's furniture. Not so, however, with the creation this month of a Department of Energy and Climate Change. Mr Brown's move split energy off from the business department, a bureaucracy which had a tendency to treat its renewables investment budget as a ready-to-raid piggy bank. The first climate change secretary, Ed Miliband, has got off to a good start. On Thursday he committed the UK to an 80% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2050, finally bringing policy into line with scientific realities. Last week, for once, Britain was on the right side of the European argument, trying to protect climate commitments from the likes of Poland, which are seeking to use the gathering slump as an excuse to cast them aside. Another welcome announcement buried in the rubble of the financial system during the last few days was agreement to a so-called feed-in tariff. This allows households with wind turbines or solar panels to sell power into the system for a fixed price, something German experience suggests will greatly encourage microgeneration.</p> <p>World-weary greens remember how the early-90s recession put paid to a passing vogue back then for environmental awareness. As jobs are shed there is an obvious danger that immediate financial security will once again become the only issue that counts. The prime minister, however, is said to discern green flashes of light in the dark economic cloud - not least because it is forcing countries to work together. At the weekend the isolationist lame duck in the White House scrambled to recover his relevance by calling an international financial summit. Even before that, coordinated action by central banks had lent multilateralism new credibility. If the international community can pull together to save planet finance then surely it can pull together for the sake of the planet as a whole too. And news this week that Abu Dhabi is to buy a 20% stake in the giant windfarm known as the London Array raises the heartening prospect that oil producers might be persuaded to plough back some profits into alternative energy, a prospect that seemed a remote hope when raised by Mr Brown last summer.</p> <p>The planet's slow-cooking is an international issue which only international action can solve. But if Mr Brown harbours ambitions to lead it, he must now show the rest of the world he can do better at home. Airport expansion is one unresolved question where Labour has ceded green turf to the Conservatives. The likely licensing of a new coal-fired power station at Kingsnorth is another urgent issue. Vague suggestions that it will be made \"ready\" for carbon capture must be meaningfully fleshed out, and soon, or it will set an appalling precedent. Doing the right thing on transport and energy will mean taking political risks. Mr Brown must now prove that he is prepared to treat an ailing climate with an injection of political capital to match the vast dose of financial capital he was so willing to invest in the banks.</p>",
  "<p>ING, the Dutch savings bank which has more than a million savers in the UK, is to get a \u20ac10bn capital injection from the Netherlands authorities, the latest bank to be affected by the global credit crisis.</p> <p>ING is the Netherlands' largest listed bank, with 85m customers worldwide, and is one of the world's top 20 financial institutions. It operates under its own name in this country, and recently took control of 180,000 accounts from failed Icelandic banks Kaupthing Singer &amp; Friedlander and Heritable Bank. </p> <p>ING has grown strongly in the UK on the back of its well-received savings products and has become a household name, regularly appearing in best-buy tables. It also took over the failed UK investment bank Barings in the 1990s.</p> <p>At a press conference tonight the Dutch finance minister, Wouter Bos, said the government would get preference shares in ING worth \u20ac10bn in return for the cash injection. The shares will pay the government annual interest of 8.5%. </p> <p>The Dutch government will also appoint two members of the bank's supervisory board - the equivalent of its board of directors. The bank is scrapping its dividend payout to shareholders and its senior executives have agreed to forfeit their annual bonuses and limit their pay-offs to a maximum of one year's salary. </p> <p>ING said it would now review pay packages for the board and senior managers to link incentive schemes \"to long term value creation and risk\"</p> <p>The funds will push up its so-called Tier 1 capital ratio to around 8% from 6.5% now. The Dutch government recently announced it had set aside \u20ac20bn to support Netherlands banks if necessary and ING is the first to apply for aid.</p> <p>The capital injection is similar to those carried out by other governments around the world who have coordinated policy to try and prevent a general collapse of the global banking system. </p> <p>In a statement ING said it \"appreciates the measures the Dutch government is taking to boost confidence and stabillity in the Dutch financial system\".</p> <p>Until recently ING had insisted that its declining profits were mainly a result of losses on its investments in shares, rather than losses related to US sub-prime mortgages. But it has clearly been hit by the general loss of confidence and falling share prices that have affected other banks so deeply.</p> <p>On Friday, ING warned that it expected to post a \u20ac500m loss for the third quarter of the year, its first such loss since being formed in 1991 and one which sent its shares down 27% to a 13-year low.</p> <p>The move could send new tremors through European banking shares when markets open tomorrow, because ING has until now been seen as being more robust than Belgian-Dutch rival Fortis, which was rescued last month by the Dutch, Belgian and Luxembourg governments.</p>",
  "<p>Alex Salmond today directly blamed Gordon Brown for creating the economic \"calamity\" that has forced the government to find \u00a3200bn to bail-out the UK's banks.</p> <p>The Scottish National party leader ended an uneasy truce between the two leaders during the banking crisis by calling Brown a \"sub-prime minister who was guilty of \"presiding over the biggest economic reverse for a generation\".</p> <p>He called on the chancellor, Alistair Darling, to block the sale of HBOS to Lloyds TSB to see if HBOS could survive on its own, now that the banking sector has been flooded with emergency funds. \"It does not deserve to be cast aside as a consequence of the age of irresponsibility,\" he said.</p> <p>Salmond, speaking to close his party's annual conference in Perth today, also tried to quash growing doubts about the case for Scottish independence, which were fuelled last week by the prime minister.</p> <p>He rejected repeated claims by the Labour leader and the new Scottish secretary, Jim Murphy, that the banking crises in Iceland, Ireland and Norway were powerful evidence against a separate Scotland.</p> <p>With the exception of Iceland, Salmond said, many of northern Europe's smaller nations were projected by the International Monetary Fund to escape a forthcoming recession. In contrast, the UK was expected \"to tumble into the economic mire\".</p> <p>The prime minister had \"almost broken our banking system\" by failing to control the excesses of the hedge funds, by allowing assets to be massively overvalued and removing legal controls on the financial sector during his 11 years in Downing Street.</p> <p>The UK government, Salmond continued, should press for deeper cuts in interest rates, cut taxes on domestic energy bills and increase spending on major public capital projects to reflate the economy.</p> <p>He accused Brown of overseeing a boom and bust made in London, creating a bust which \"almost broke our banks\". Scotland's greatest company \u2013 Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 had been forced to give the UK government preference shares of 12% and allowed HBOS, Scotland's oldest bank, to be bought by Lloyds TSB.</p> <p>\"The prime minister thinks this is an advert for the union?\" he asked. \"I would have thought that the condition of the economy, the fears of our people, the state of the financial sector, are a staggering condemnation of the state of the United Kingdom.\"</p> <p>Iain Gray, the Scottish Labour party leader, retorted that Salmond had shown a \"failure of leadership \u2026 He clung to the politics of grievance and indulged in a blame game. He called for a new age of responsibility. Yet he dodged his today.\"</p> <p>Salmond had himself said an independent Scotland would run the banking system with \"light touch\" regulation, and had last year criticised UK ministers for being too heavy handed with the City.</p> <p>Salmond's speech has come at a crucial time for his government in Edinburgh and his party, with just over two weeks of campaigning left in the Glenrothes byelection \u2013 a seat that borders Brown's own constituency and home town of Kirkcaldy.</p> <p>Labour sources believe the prime minister's recent performance has greatly increased Labour's chances of retaining Glenrothes on November 6, despite a potent campaign by the SNP, which has the equivalent Scottish parliament seat.</p> <p>However, Salmond appeared to admit his government was powerless to meaningfully intervene in the economy and relied instead on the UK government in London to use its powers to regenerate the </p> <p>His only new policy announcement was that a pilot project to help build shared-equity homes for first time buyers would now get \u00a360m a year, and be spread Scotland-wide. </p> <p>In addition, tens of thousands of small businesses would see their rates cut, and ministers would continue to press the UK government to release \u00a31bn in funds held by the Treasury and organisations such as Ofgem. </p> <p>The electricity regulator holds \u00a3120m in Scotland's share of the fossil fuel levy for renewable energy projects, but Treasury rules state that money cannot be used as extra revenue by the Scottish government. This meant new green power projects were being stifled. </p> <p>\"The reason that the SNP is trusted by the people is that they know in good times and in tough times, Scotland's party put Scotland first and will not take no for an answer,\" he said.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Treasury will pump billions of pounds into the public sector to help fend off the worst of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/recession\">economic downturn</a>, the chancellor said today.</p> <p>Alistair Darling said plans for two aircraft carriers and a new nuclear deterrent would go ahead. London's \u00a316bn Crossrail project and the \u00a39.3bn budget for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/olympics2012\">2012 Olympic Games</a> were also safe.</p> <p>Construction projects, such as schools and hospitals, could be brought forward in the forthcoming pre-budget report, which would see spending earmarked for 2010/11 used sooner in a bid to move the economy from the brink of recession.</p> <p>\"What I want to avoid is getting ourselves in a position governments have done in the past where you face an immediate problem and cut back on the things the country will need in the future,\" said Darling in an interview with the Sunday Telegraph.</p> <p>His comments came as Lord Mandelson, the new trade secretary, said many small and medium-sized companies would encounter financial difficulties and \"may even lose their businesses\".</p> <p>Mandelson said there was no way of stopping a \"contraction\" of the economy and that it was impossible to tell how long it would last, but stopped short of using the word recession. \"I'm not going to use that word because I can't foretell the size of the contraction that is going to occur,\" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr show.</p> <p>Darling, who also promised to increase borrowing to help homeowners and protect jobs, said the increased spending would be financed by extra borrowing, and justified it by pointing to debt reductions in the last 10 years. The chancellor said housing, energy and small businesses would benefit in his new spending plans.</p> <p>He promised an interventionist style to boost the economy, implementing the strategy of the celebrated economist John Maynard Keynes. The chancellor said: \"This is a time when you have to support the economy. You will see us switching our spending priorities to areas which make a difference.\"</p> <p>But the shadow chancellor, George Osborne, said: \"While the Chancellor speculates about the timing of big capital projects that could take years to get off the ground, that's not going to help small businesses struggling this winter.\"</p> <p>Osborne reiterated the call made by David Cameron in the Observer for small businesses to be allowed to defer paying their tax bills for six months. </p> <p>The former director general of the CBI and ex-trade minister, Lord Digby Jones, endorsed the Tories' plan for a VAT holiday for small firms. He also said the government's plan to spend itself out of a recession \"in a limited, guarded way, does have legs\".</p> <p>He cautioned that any spending must be on infrastructure projects that improved productivity and on schools, hospitals and frontline services.</p> <p>\"But if it's spent on just creating employment, in other words loads and loads more administrators in the public sector, then of course it doesn't work,\" he told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend.</p> <p>He stressed that increased spending must be closely monitored to avoid destabilising the economy.</p> <p>The prime minister today urged energy firms to play their part by cutting bills as gas and oil costs fall. It follows his insistence this week that falling oil prices should be reflected at the petrol pumps.</p> <p>Writing in the People, Gordon Brown said: \"Now that global oil and gas prices are falling, we will demand that energy companies pass on these cuts to their customers as price reductions as soon as possible.\"</p> <p>Yesterday, Brown warned the financial crisis had exposed the \"weaknesses\" of unfettered capitalism. While maintaining he was pro-business, the prime minister said the relationship between governments and the markets was being studied anew and financial systems must reflect the values of \"fairness, stewardship and co-operation\" cherished by families and communities.</p> <p>Today's latest opinion poll showed the Conservatives, after losing ground over the last month, were now just nine points ahead of Labour. The ComRes survey for the Independent on Sunday gave the Tories 40%, Labour 31% and the Liberal Democrats 16%.</p> <p>While the findings would still put David Cameron in power if replicated by voting in a general election, they are the monthly poll's most favourable findings for Gordon Brown since March, and follow praise for his response to the financial crisis.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown took a global lead with his comprehensive <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/economy\">bail-out package</a> for British banks. The PM's rescue plan, which was emulated in the US and across Europe, is a bold set of measures that marks a departure from the economic orthodoxy of recent decades.</p> <p>But not everybody is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/14/gordonbrown-finance\">applauding the shift</a>. US treasury secretary Hank Paulson in particular showed his distaste for part-nationalising the US banking sector. The former CEO of Goldman Sachs accepted state involvement in the banking industry only as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/16/useconomy-usa\">least worst option</a> in the short term. But what's wrong with state involvement in the financial sector \u2013 even in the long term?</p> <p>Most commentators agree that a tighter regulatory framework must be at the heart of remodelled financial markets. But this tighter framework has to be enforced. This requires supervisory capabilities on all levels. Whether there will be some sort of international financial services authority \u2013 which is preferable \u2013 or just better cooperation between existing national regulators, the early warning system must be significantly improved. Individual banks could carry out extra supervision, especially if the government is a shareholder.</p> <p>I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/26/economics.tax\">previously wrote</a> that the government's role as insurer of last resort for financial institutions has changed the relationship between civil society \u2013 represented by government \u2013 and the financial industry. And given the amount of taxpayers' money the state has pumped into the financial system, citizens can expect that their government keeps a close eye on banks. A \"no questions asked\" blank cheque for banks would contradict all principles of prudent governance. So the government has two reasons to monitor banks' activity: to make sure that taxpayers' money is used efficiently, and to help prevent future crises. These conditions must be attached to the bail-out.</p> <p>But if the chief short-term reason for government involvement in financial institutions is to create trust, I can't see why reasonable state involvement in banks could not stabilise the volatile financial sector for the foreseeable future. I am not proposing the long-term nationalisation of the banking sector, or that the government should try to run or micro-manage individual banks. But why can't it remain a minority shareholder in those banks deemed essential for the stability of the financial system? Of course, such a minority share shouldn't destroy the profitability of banks, but it could ensure that stability is maintained and that citizens too benefit once the current turmoil is over.</p> <p>A government presence on a bank's supervisory board would give other shareholders a better chance of keeping track of how their investments are being managed. In the UK, these supervisory boards are unusual and introducing them would require corporate governance reform. But that would not be difficult. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Company_Statute\">European Company Statute</a>, adopted in 2001, allows for the setting up of European Public Companies (SEs) in all EU member states. An SE can be created by simply converting an existing company, and can operate under a two-tier system which includes a supervisory board that controls the management board. Applying this corporate structure to financial institutions is not a problem, as the example of <a href=\"http://www.allianz.com/en/allianz_group/about_us/profile/index.html\">Allianz</a> shows. The biggest German financial services company became an SE in 2006. An additional benefit would be that SEs make pan-European activities and mergers easier, which was the initial reason for introducing a European Company Statute.</p> <p>So, in order to monitor companies and markets better and stabilise the financial system in the long term, why do governments not maintain a minority share in important financial institutions and exercise the supervision rights that can come with it? This model is not a socialist nationalisation of the banking sector, which would indeed be very unhelpful. But it is not a return to the now failed system either. It would reflect the new relationship between governments and the financial sector \u2013 with which neither has yet come to terms \u2013 and make sure that taxpayers can benefit financially from the unprecedented guarantees they are currently forced to give. </p> <p>A system like this would not prevent future crises, but it would make it easier to identify problems before they grew into full-blown catastrophes. Isn't that what is needed above all?</p>",
  "<p>Ron Dennis, the McLaren team principal, has praised Lewis Hamilton's flawless victory in the Chinese grand prix, but said the team is under no illusions that the championship is theirs.</p> <p>Hamilton took pole, set fastest lap and took the victory today, and despite title rival Felipe Massa claiming second, he needs to finish no higher than fifth in the Brazilian grand prix in two weeks' time to win the title. But Dennis warned Hamilton to \"keep the discipline going\" over the team radio after his win and said that for the next week the 23 year-old would be put in an environment where he is not thinking about motor-racing at all.</p> <p>\"We just want him to chill out, keep training and not worry about anything because there is nothing to be gained by thinking about other things,\" said Dennis. \"All he has to do is turn up in Brazil in very good condition, do all the normal things he does to combat jetlag, prepare mentally, and then we will get on and do a job. But we recall we went to Brazil last year and didn't win the championship, so we are under no illusions. We know it's not done.\"</p> <p>Hamilton went into last year's finale at Interlagos with a similar seven point margin over Kimi Raikkonen, but after a botched pass and gearbox trouble he finished seventh, giving the Finn the title.</p>",
  "<p>It was only last December that Gordon Brown demonstrated his ardour for Europe by signing the Lisbon Treaty in splendid isolation, two hours after his fellow <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/eu\">EU</a> leaders and behind closed doors. Now the prime minister is managing to get away with presenting himself as being at the heart of Europe, albeit only because in the midst of an economic meltdown that nobody predicted \u2013 least of all him \u2013 his period as chancellor in one of the EU's longest-serving administrations means that he is credited with greater knowledge of the mess than his less-experienced continental counterparts.</p> <p>The nature of Brown's history with the EU has been explored elsewhere (not least recently by my <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/uk-politics/2008/10/brown-european-british-blair\">New Statesman colleague James Macintyre</a>). But the perceived new placing of Britain in Europe, however cynical, is of clear domestic advantage to the government when faced by an opposition whose leader has still not fulfilled a party election pledge to withdraw Tory MEPs from the integrationist European People's Party grouping. His hesitancy is understandable, given that the only other grouping feasibly open to his Euro MPs includes such voter-friendly charmers as Robert Kilroy-Silk and Jean-Marie Le Pen. But with <a href=\"http://news.scotsman.com/uk/Inside-Westminster--Tory-MEPs.4555203.jp\">European elections</a> in June, Cameron will have to face \u2013 or fudge \u2013 the issue sooner rather than later.</p> <p>The truth is that all this obfuscation on Europe has suited both major political parties. The less we hear about whether we should join the Euro or not (convenient as we may find it when holidaying cross-Manche) and about treaties that may or may not be constitutions, the better. EU questions cross and divide parties. Remember the Maastricht rebels? Or all that fuss about Brown's five tests? Playing a waiting game, hoping nothing much changes, putting off any firm decisions: that's much safer.</p> <p>Except it's not really safer at all. People are said to find the issue of Europe boring. But I find nothing boring about the fact that EU law now supersedes our own (and in matters of far greater import than the relative curvature of bananas). Nor do I find it boring that one day Britain and France will almost certainly cede their permanent seats on the UN Security Council to the EU; nor that the EU is already beginning to act as a united foreign policy bloc as a member of the quartet, with Russia, the US and UN, in relation to Israel.</p> <p>Despite Labour's historic Euroscepticism (advocating withdrawal from the then EEC in the 1983 general election manifesto, for instance), there is a sense that progressives, being internationalists, should automatically be in favour of ever closer union. However, there are different types of internationalism, and we need to decide whether the pooling of sovereignty involved in making any supranational body effective is something we want to commit to a protectionist, culturally inward-looking EU or to more genuinely international bodies: trying to revive the moribund Commonwealth, perhaps, or attempting to strengthen and reform a UN we should not and cannot give up on. </p> <p>As global power shifts and ebbs inexorably eastwards these are questions of great gravity \u2013 far more so, in fact, than the minutiae of domestic politics with which we preoccupy ourselves. Entertaining though such jousting may be, our long-term relationships, unilateral or EU-mediated, with Russia, India and China are more likely to concern future historians than the precise details of what George Osborne said to Peter Mandelson in a Greek taverna or the vexing subject of whether David Cameron sets a bad example by not always wearing his cycling helmet.</p> <p>Rather than let the EU steadily and stealthily accrete power \u2013 as Europhiles claim that it does not, although the transformation from a European Economic Community to a European Union proves otherwise \u2013 we need to decide what Britain's future will be in this body. We should not be lulled into thinking our European future benign merely because Brown seems temporarily to bestride the continent like some new Metternich.</p> <p>It should be a cause of outrage that Labour reneged on its promise to hold a referendum on the EU constitution that reemerged as the Lisbon Treaty. So too should news that Ireland is likely to be asked to hold a <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12429431\">second referendum</a> next October. The Irish rejected Lisbon in June, but this expression of a people's will was not deemed acceptable by the Eurocrats. What happens if the Irish vote no again \u2013 will they be asked to repeat the exercise until they finally come up with the correct answer? </p> <p>We claim to care deeply about the maintenance and establishment of democracy in other parts of the world. How curious that we appear to be so nonchalant about its practice at home, especially when the very nature of what our home is, who rules it, and what say we will have in its governance, is changing without us, the voters, ever being consulted.</p>",
  "<p>For years, debate about Iran has oscillated between two bad alternatives. Some are convinced that a nuclear Iran is the worst of all possible scenarios, worse even than the fall-out from a pre-emptive strike. But neither a nuclear-armed Iran nor air strikes against it are wise options, certainly not for this region. </p> <p>The repercussions of bombing Iran should be clear: closure of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strait_of_Hormuz\">Strait of Hormuz</a>, rocketing oil prices, possible retaliation against Israel (regardless of the origin of the attack), and even greater turmoil in Iraq and Afghanistan. Indeed, the only certainty of any pre-emptive strike is irreparable and long-lasting damage to regional security and political and economic stability. </p> <p>Of course, the alternative is no safer. A nuclear-armed Iran would change the entire region's security environment, and, given the enmity between Israel and Iran, two such nuclear powers facing off against each other would pose a threat. </p> <p>The way out of this dilemma is to understand what Iran wants \u2013 and how to accommodate it without jeopardising anyone's security.</p> <p>President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has said that Iran wants to develop uranium enrichment technology for industrial use. Everyone agrees that Iran has the right to do so. But the world is split over whether to believe that Iran is actually doing what it says.</p> <p>If, as some argue, Iran is being disingenuous, then once it achieves this first phase \u2013 uranium enrichment for industrial purposes \u2013 it can easily slide into weapons-grade enrichment, leaving the international community out in the cold, with no channels of communication, no observation teams in place, and no monitors ready to sound the whistle. </p> <p>That is why the world must not remain focused on the already-lost first phase. Iran has more than 3,000 centrifuges despite all the international sanctions and threats. Instead, the world must focus on the second phase, because it is weapons potential that is the looming danger, and it is here that internationally-mandated mechanisms for oversight and supervision exist. </p> <p>The Iranians have always said that they will continue to honour their commitments and open their doors to observation as members of the <a href=\"http://www.fas.org/nuke/control/npt/text/npt3.htm\">non-proliferation community</a>. But the international community must be more respectful of Iran's current industrial aims if it wants Iranian cooperation.</p> <p>The first step is to assuage Iran's feeling of being besieged. Fortunately, there are voices in America and elsewhere that advocate engaging Iran at the highest level. But to talk with Iran effectively one must understand Iranian values and thinking.</p> <p>Iranians have a sense of seniority, if not superiority, born of a rich and ancient culture that has survived into modern times. But they also have a historically ingrained sense of insecurity, owing to frequent conquest and domination, which is being aggravated today by the presence of American troops to their west in Iraq and to their east in Afghanistan. Their outlook nowadays is the product of these two worldviews \u2013 suspicious of others' motives and proud of themselves as smart, tough negotiators and not without their own resources.</p> <p>In my meetings with the current and past leaders of Syria and Iran, as well as in my meeting with Saddam Hussein, I heard them all say the same thing: the west is out to get them. Their explanation was that the west is uncomfortable with the motives and behaviour of ideological states _ Syria, Iran, and Iraq under Saddam were states with causes _ Islam, Arab unity, or anti-Zionism. </p> <p>For Iranians, as bearers of faith and national pride, responses that seem to others self-righteous and irrational are, in fact, necessary and acceptable. </p> <p>The case of Saddam's weapons of mass destruction is a historic example of a willingness to go to hell with your head held high. Saddam knew that he didn't have weapons of mass destruction, but he was unwilling to concede the right of inspectors to ask. </p> <p>As in North Korea, Iran's neighbours might provide the right mechanism to create a more transparent relationship between Iran and the world. In the so-called \"six-party talks\", North Korea's neighbours offered tangible incentives to Kim Jong-il's regime to abandon its nuclear programme. The most prominent of these was an end to North Korea's economic isolation.</p> <p>Iran, too, feels besieged, though it is not isolated: it depends heavily on trade, and not just as a seller of oil. Two-thirds of its population is under the age of 30, and unemployment is high; it needs to attract foreign investment for its oil and gas industry, and to finance road construction and other infrastructure projects.</p> <p>Comparisons with neighbouring Turkey are instructive. Before Iran's Islamic revolution, it led Turkey in foreign direct investment, income per head, and GDP growth. Now Turkey has moved ahead, and may even join the European Union.</p> <p>Other regional comparisons further reinforce that trend. The Qataris have outstripped the Iranians in exploiting the huge gas field they share. Tiny Dubai draws in far more foreign investment: Iranians go there for banking, trade, and fun. </p> <p>Iran's neighbours need to convince Iran's rulers that Iranians, too, can participate in the region's growth, and even become regional leaders. Only an open Iran, fully integrated into the regional economy and granted a role commensurate to its size and economic potential, will be able to moderate its siege mentality.</p> <p>Here, a vital step would be for the west to begin to envisage Iran as a potential alternative supplier of gas, by offering to link Iran to the proposed White Stream and Nabucco pipelines that are currently under development to bring Central Asian gas to Europe.</p> <p>The world's judgments about Iran's motives and actions should not be distorted by Iranian pride. We can only understand Iran's real intentions by engaging the Iranians \u2013 not cornering them.</p> <p><em>Vartan Oskanian, Armenia's minister of foreign affairs from 1998 until April 2008, is the founder of the Yerevan-based <a href=\"http://www.civilitasfoundation.org/\">Civilitas Foundation</a>. </em></p> <p><em>Copyright: <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2008.</em></p>",
  "<p>Instead of worshipping the invisible, and usually remote, hand of the market economy (which too often can be caught picking the pockets of the poor), you design an economic system in which resources flow and circulate effectively to serve the invisible heart of the core economy \u2013 made up of family, neighbourhood, community and civil society.</p> <p>One unintended consequence of the current global financial crisis is that it will reveal what some have known for a long time, namely that a new <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics\">economics</a> is already emerging. The tragedy is that the crisis-ridden financial system has long since failed to do the basic job required \u2013 underpin the productive economy and the fundamental operating systems upon which we all depend. These have been variously neglected, taken for granted or cannibalised by finance. They include the core economy of family, neighbourhood, community and society, and the natural economy of the biosphere, our oceans forests and fields. <br> That is why, as we aim for recovery, we should not be trying to get back to how things were before. Before was built on an illusion of limitless credit and unlimited natural resources. It was unsustainable for many reasons. Injecting liquidity into the system and looking for signs of recovery in the return of consumer binge-spending on the high street will simply lay the foundations for an even bigger crash in the future. Consumerism is highly addictive, giving a brief high that quickly wears off and is damaging to both the individual and the world around them. For a society like Britain, there is a large and growing literature that shows, fairly conclusively, we have been looking in the wrong place to find greater life satisfaction and measure the economy's success. With most people having most of their basic material needs met, organising society to achieve progress through indiscriminately rising consumption not only doesn't work \u2013 the fall-out from the long hours, throwaway, materialistic, individualistic, status-obsessed culture that accompanies it, is counter-productive, undermining and ultimately destructive.  For a vision of what an alternative might look like, the current edition of <a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/home.ns\">New Scientist</a> magazine contains enough economic heresy (but scientific common sense) to choke every finance minister in the northern hemisphere and the whole staff of the International Monetary Fund. Best is the vision for what the country and economy could like in 2020. In it, we have moved from an economy of over-consumption, through-put and waste, and the anachronism of overwork and unemployment, to one which the ecological economist <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicy.umd.edu/facstaff/faculty/Daly.html\">Herman Daly</a> describes as, \"a subtle and complex economics of maintenance, qualitative improvements, sharing, frugality, and adaptation to natural limits. It is an economics of better, not bigger.\"</p> <p>The good thing about such an economy is that it is rich in employment and the thick weave of local, micro-economic relationships that help to create resilient economies and bind communities together. Instead of worshipping the invisible, and usually remote, hand of the market economy (which too often can be caught picking the pockets of the poor), you design an economic system in which resources flow and circulate effectively to serve the invisible heart of the core economy \u2013 made up of family, neighbourhood, community and civil society.</p> <p>It is already happening in place but could quickly move to a much bigger scale. Google tell their staff to spend 10% of their time not doing their job. They're free to get involved with the local community. The company has found that as a result it has made staff more innovative. A lot of research shows that such community involvement also has a very positive payback in terms of life satisfaction. A 10% rule could be introduced across the economy with time credited to the local community. But we could go further. In Britain, the idea of a shorter working week was sullied by the chaos of the 1970s. But again, if people who over-work, worked less, employment could be more equally distributed. Coupled with other innovations to ensure a basic income guaranteeing basic needs, shorter working weeks help turn us from being time-poor, to time-affluent. With more time for family, community and creative learning it makes for happier people and better neighbourhoods.</p> <p>A duty of reciprocity in public services could also help nurture the core economy. People who offer time, as simple as making visits to the elderly and infirm, could earn time credits to use public services like leisure centres at off peak times. </p> <p>Local authorities could use Section 106 (the planning gain law) in negotiations with businesses, to introduce a \"time commitment\" ensuring that they bring some useful service to the local community \u2013 even if only making rooms available for use. <a href=\"http://www.timebanks.co.uk/what_is_timebanking.asp\">Time banking</a> is already working successfully in some health centres. In Wales a time banking system was introduced in which older women provided skills to local schools and were given time credits in return. They cashed them in for bingo sessions during the day and theatre performances in the evening. Their fear of going out at night was solved because the local rugby club was part of the scheme too, and took time credits to accompany them. Then, the women started to lose their fear of going out, and felt secure enough to go alone. There was an upward spiral of personal and communal well-being. Note that these are all low-carbon, relationship building activities. </p> <p>Life satisfaction scores tend to be much higher among people with a more communally oriented set of values than those who are materialistic and individualistic. They are also less driven to consume for its own sake. Kick the addiction. Get time-rich. Be happy.</p>",
  "<p>So Gordon Brown is now calling for a 2008 rerun of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/15/economy-gordonbrown1\">1944 Bretton Woods</a> meeting. Is this political posturing or is there a case for a global summit on the financial system? The events of the last year, and especially those of the last few weeks, have reminded us that the financial system can cause widespread damage.</p> <p>Compared to 1944, this capability has been enhanced by globalisation, the abolition of exchange controls almost everywhere and advances in financial engineering. If a framework can be designed which mitigates this risk, then we should attempt to create one. The IMF may have been brilliantly designed in 1944, but its role, funding and political clout have, if anything, diminished in recent times, and so it is likely that a new body with a new charter is what is needed. What are the roles that such a body needs to fill?</p> <p>\u0095 Accident prevention: Financial institutions are central to economic stability in our world. Because of the infectious nature of problems emerging in any one part of the system, it seems important that any global body should have as a central task the maintenance of systemic stability.</p> <p>The central idea here is to protect the system from irrational exuberance. Regulation plays a key role and it would seem logical that the new agency should take over what has hitherto been called the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_Accords\">Basle process</a> of bank regulation, along with corresponding initiatives in the insurance sector. This is not to suggest that there should be a global regulator, but simply that the design and implementation of regulation should be coordinated. The new body would set minimum standards and would prescribe a uniform approach to be implemented in all member states with a view to limiting \"regulatory arbitrage\" \u2013 the exploitation of differences in regulatory treatment in different jurisdictions and in different types of entity. Another area where a new agency could promote stability is in striking a balance between those derivative products which are traded and cleared, and those which are dealt with \"over the counter\" on a bilateral basis. The requirement to post margin on cleared transactions, and the discipline of standardised contracts and central credit control which is inherent in cleared markets, has great merit.</p> <p>\u0095 Early warning system: The new body would be an obvious venue for policy coordination in times of stress but, perhaps more importantly, it ought to act as an early warning system. Very recent experience suggests that this is possibly the most important role of all for a couple of reasons. Firstly, had such a body been in place, it would have been in a position to warn central banks and regulators alike about the challenge that financial institutions would have in recycling US budgetary and payments deficits on the one hand, and burgeoning Asian savings on the other. Similarly, such an agency would have been able publicly to comment on the way in which banking systems in certain countries had outgrown the ability of those countries' central banks to act as lenders of last resort. The obvious case in point is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/05/iceland.creditcrunch\">Iceland</a>.</p> <p>\u0095 Lender of last resort: This was the IMF's role but it now neither has the resources nor the mandate to act in this way. Setting up a lender of last resort in 2008 would require a concerted effort from the leading central banks \u2013 the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of Japan and so on \u2013 and could presumably be dealt with through a combination of paid-in capital and stand-by lines.</p> <p>These are just the bones of an outline of an agency that would likely be a \"big boys club\", rather than a financial United Nations. In order to be effective, it would need the wholehearted support of politicians, central banks and regulators. If it got that, the effort would be worthwhile. </p> <p><em>This article was written with the advice and assistance of Stephen Kingsley, director of financial services at <a href=\"http://www.lecg.com/\">LECG</a></em></p>"
