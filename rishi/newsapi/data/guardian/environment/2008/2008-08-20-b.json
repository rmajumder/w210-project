  "<p>First of all you need to decide whether you want to study full-time or combine your studies with work.</p> <p>Broadly speaking, there are three routes open to you depending on how you like to learn. Within the range of qualifications there will be something to suit most people.</p> <p>If you like academic, paper-based learning, then A-levels, an International Baccalaureate (or a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2006/oct/24/schools.1419education\">Welsh bacc</a> if you're in Wales) or the Cambridge Pre-U might be for you.</p> <p>If you prefer a mix of hands-on learning and theory then the new diploma, or the tried and tested BTec (Business and Technology Education Council) might prove better options, and can always be combined with A-levels. </p> <p>However, it's worth noting that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/apr/01/schools.uk4\">ministers warned in April</a> thousands of City &amp; Guilds, BTecs and national vocational qualifications (NVQs) could be scrapped or absorbed into the new diplomas.</p> <p>If you want to train for a specific job, an apprenticeship or an NVQ might be your best bet - and they still leave open the option of university if you decide later that you want to take a degree.</p> <p>As far as entry requirements go, for A-levels it's fairly straightforward \u2013 you will need at least four GCSEs at grade A to C - but with these and most other qualifications you need to check with your school or college what they expect. </p> <p>If you're interested in a particular course or subject, you could also go to the exam boards (listed below) and check the entry requirements with them.</p> <h2>A-levels</h2> <p>These are still the best option if you like paper-based learning and you've got the required grades to take them.</p> <p>From September, the structure of A-levels will be changing. Instead of six modules, you'll study only four in more depth. Exams are taken at the end of each module, which count towards your final mark and can be retaken.</p> <p>There'll be more extended essays for you to write and you'll be expected to make connections between different aspects of the subjects.</p> <p>In the exams there will be more open-ended questions and you'll be able to earn a new A* if you're one of the top performers.</p> <p>The first A* grades will be awarded in 2010. </p> <p>You also have the option of doing an extended project, if you want to look into a particular subject and do some independent research. The project will be worth half an A-level and might help you stand out from the crowd if you decide to apply to university.</p> <p>There are also applied A-levels, which are A-levels taken in more vocational subjects, such as leisure and tourism. But these are being slowly phased out and will be available only until diplomas are offered in all subjects across the country (expected to be 2011).</p> <p>If you live in Scotland, you'll be able to take Scottish Highers and Advanced Highers, which are the equivalent of A-levels.</p> <h2>AS-levels</h2> <p>If you pass your first year of A-level and decide not to continue with your studies you will be awarded an AS-level.</p> <p>AS-levels are a good opportunity to try out a subject and get a qualification even if you decide not to carry on to A-level. And there are more than 70 AS-levels to choose from.</p> <h2>Cambridge Pre-U Diploma</h2> <p>Some schools are offering this new qualification from the University of Cambridge, which is supposed to be tougher than A-levels and make it easier for universities to distinguish between the best candidates.</p> <p>It's mostly private schools that are giving students the chance to take this qualification instead of A-levels but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/jul/23/alevels.cambridgeuniversity\">15 state schools have signed up</a> so far, so you will need to check whether it's something your school is offering.</p> <p>For the CPU, you take at least three \"principal\" subjects from a choice of 26.</p> <p>Instead of taking exams at the end of each module, you'll take exams at the end of the two-year course. You'll be expected to write more essays and there will be no retakes.</p> <p>Alongside your chosen subjects, you'll have to complete an independent research report and a \"global perspectives portfolio\". Through a series of seminars based on themes - practical ethics, economics, environment, technology, and politics and culture \u2013 you'll build up a portfolio of work including audio-visual and web-based presentations and develop detailed research proposals.</p> <p>The portfolio and research report can be taken as stand-alone qualifications, alongside A-levels, which could make your application stand out when applying for university. The CPU has been approved by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, although Ucas has yet to reveal what it is worth, compared with A-levels.</p> <h2>International Baccalaureate</h2> <p>This worldwide qualification is offered mostly by private schools. You will take six subjects - three at a standard level and three at a higher level over two years. You'll have some choice over subjects but the idea is to give a rounded education so you have to continue with English, a second language, a science, maths, arts and humanities.</p> <p>Full marks in the IB are equivalent to more than seven A-grade A-levels.</p> <h2>Welsh baccalaureate</h2> <p>This is a diploma on three levels for 14 to 19-year-olds. But at the post-16 advanced level, you'd take two or more A-levels plus an advanced core module.</p> <p>The core at level 3 is worth 120 Ucas points, equivalent to an A-level grade A.</p> <h2>Diplomas</h2> <p>The first five of these <a href=\"http://yp.direct.gov.uk/diplomas\">new qualifications </a> will be taught from September, although eventually, by 2011, there will be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/oct/23/schools.1419education\"> 17 of them</a> to choose from.</p> <p>The first five are in:<br><a href=\"http://www.engineeringdiploma.com\">engineering</a>,<br><a href=\"http://www.cbediploma.co.uk\">construction</a>,<br><a href=\"http://www.e-skills.com/diploma\">information technology</a>,<br><a href=\"http://www.creativediploma.com\">creative and media</a>,<br><a href=\"http://diploma.skillsforhealth.org.uk\">society, health and development</a></p> <p>Diplomas are a mixture of classroom learning and practical experience that should qualify you to go into a mixture of skilled jobs or on to university if you choose.</p> <p>There are three different levels of diploma: foundation (level 1), higher (level 2) and advanced (level 3).</p> <p>Assuming you've got your GCSEs, you'll be heading for an advanced diploma. In which case, you'll do an extended project \u2013 which will mean doing research into an area of your subject that you're particularly interested in and writing about it \u2013 as well as taking an A-level or equivalent qualifications. </p> <p>The government has put together a <a href=\"http://www.accreditedqualifications.org.uk/DiplomaCatalogueSelection.aspx\">catalogue</a> of possible qualifications you could take to make up your diploma.</p> <p>All the diplomas will be made up of three parts: principal learning; generic learning and additional specialist learning.</p> <p>Principal learning \u2013 you'll study qualifications developed for the diploma in your chosen subject, eg engineering, and undertake a project in this area.</p> <p>Generic learning \u2013 this is where you'll learn \"functional skills\" such as English, maths and ICT and develop skills to help make you more employable, such as presentation, communication and teamworking. You'll also have to do 10 days work experience, ideally in a field related to your diploma subject, so if you're taking the engineering diploma, this could mean seeing how an architect works.</p> <p>Additional specialist learning \u2013 this is where you specialise in some aspect of your subject and learn more of the academic theory behind it. You will have to complete an extended project and take an A-level or equivalent in a related subject. For example, you could take an A-level in art if you're taking the creative diploma, or two AS-levels or a BTec.</p> <p>How demanding each element of the diploma will be will depend on which level you're taking. </p> <h2>BTec</h2> <p>These are vocational qualifications that prepare you to go into work or higher education.</p> <p>There are three types of qualification all at Level 3 (equivalent to A-level): the BTec National Award; BTec National Certificate and BTec National Diploma.</p> <p>The 6-unit National Award is a specialist qualification that focuses on particular aspects of your chosen subject. It is broadly equivalent to one A-level and is graded pass, merit or distinction.</p> <p>The 12-unit National Certificate is more specialised and you can choose what area of your chosen subject to focus on. It is broadly equivalent to two A-levels.</p> <p>The 18-unit BTec National Diploma extends and deepens your understanding of your chosen area of study and prepares you for work in this field. It is broadly equivalent to three A-levels.</p> <h2>Apprenticeships</h2> <p>If you're not keen on a traditional, academic approach to learning and prefer a more hands-on approach, an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/jan/28/1419education.furthereducation\">apprenticeship</a> might be a good option.</p> <p>It's also a good idea if you know what career you want to go into, but would still like to keep the option of university open as you can go on to take a foundation degree fairly easily after completing an apprenticeship.</p> <p>You will be based with a company, learning the job on the ground, but will have days off to study at college. The work/study split will be decided between you and your employer.</p> <p>Alternatively, you could do a programme-led apprenticeship (PLA), where you spend a year or so in college learning theory and key skills before you go to an employer for on-the-job training to get a an NVQ qualification.</p> <p>To <a href=\"http://www.apprenticeships.org.uk/wanttobecomeanapprentice/aboutapprenticeships/howtoapply/\">apply</a> for an apprenticeship you can approach an employer directly about the possibility of taking you on or call the national Apprenticeships hotline on 08000 150 600, which will then be able to put you in touch with local employers and training centres.</p> <p>For more information on your options, you could visit the Connexions Direct website: http://www.connexions-direct.com/itsyourchoice/choiceisyours/</p> <h2>City &amp; Guilds</h2> <p><a href=\" http://www.city-and-guilds.co.uk\">City &amp; Guilds</a> also offer vocational qualifications. There are more than 400 subjects to choose from.</p> <h2>NVQs</h2> <p>For those who are not keen on continuing studying after 16, and decide to get a job, you can still gain qualifications for the work you do through an <a href=\"http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/EducationAndLearning/QualificationsExplained/DG_10039029\">NVQ</a>. NVQs assess the skills that candidates demonstrate at work and are available at five levels, from level 1 - for routine jobs - to level 5 - for jobs with complex tasks and substantial responsibility: </p> <p>For more information on your options from 14-19, click <a href=\"http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/EducationAndLearning/14To19/OptionsAt16/DG_10013574\">here</a>.</p> <h2>Exam boards</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.edexcel.org.uk\">Edexcel</a><br>020 7190 5700</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.aqa.org.uk\">Assessment and Qualifications Alliance (AQA)</a><br>01483 506506</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ocr.org.uk\">Oxford, Cambridge and RSA (OCR)</a><br>01223 553 998</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.wjec.co.uk\">Welsh Joint Education Committee (WJEC)</a><br>029 2026 5000</p>",
  "<p>I had a cold call from BT recently offering me a cut of \u00a32 a month on my broadband package plus free phone calls at weekends and in the evenings if I signed up for a fresh yearly contract. Since inertia would have made this happen anyway, I signed up. This at least shows that inflation isn't going up everywhere. Thanks to fierce competition, improving technology and the growing influence of \"free\" or very cheap calls from new web start-ups, telephone inflation is falling. The exception is using data from abroad for music or videos where roaming charges are still usurious.</p> <p>The ultimate vision is of cheap handsets using wireless hotspots to route calls through the internet to anyone in the world with a Wi-Fi connection. And all for free after paying a monthly fee to an internet service provider. This is already possible with some phones. The snag is that, like fax machines, it is not much use having one until everyone you want to talk to has one as well.</p> <p>There is an added problem. Skype is the runaway success of web telephony, even though it is mainly used for calls between computer users. It is free for all basic voice and video uses, but is proprietary and so far can't communicate with rivals using open standards such as Truphone, the first web phone company to put an app on Apple's iPhone.</p> <p>Truphone is impressive, but I also have a soft spot for 3's Skype phone, which is the only phone so far that employs Skype technology. This is because when I first tried it a year or two ago it worked straight out of the box, which hasn't happened with any other web phone - though they are getting better. Once I had typed in my login, all my existing Skype contacts (which are stored on the web) were on the screen and I had an hour's free chat with a friend using Skype from his computer.</p> <p>I had a similar experience with 3's new Skype phone, which hits the shops this week. It employs 3's global 3G network to originate and terminate calls while using the Skype network to route them around the world. This means that if you have a family scattered around the world - or run a small business - you could buy everyone a Skype phone for Christmas and gossip almost endlessly for nothing without needing Wi-Fi.</p> <p>The cost is only \u00a369 for the handset - plus, if you want to use the Skype facility, a pay-as-you-go tariff of \u00a310 a month. Not bad. The phone can also be used as a modem (or dongle) automatically by attaching a cable from it to the USB port of your laptop (PCs only) so you could use your computer abroad without incurring those ludicrous roaming charges.</p> <p>Other functions are also easy to use. A single button on the right side of the handset activates a \"carousel\" of services on the screen such as Google, web feeds, Facebook (which worked well), messages plus a \"Quicklinks\" button giving access to more sites from eBay to the BBC or music. There is a 3.2 megapixel camera and media player all packed into a device weighing less than 100g.</p> <p>Niggles? The keyboard didn't suit my fingers and it was tricky to bookmark new sites - not that you need them with so many embedded - and it takes at least six separate clicks to send each photo to a laptop via Bluetooth. But these are small gripes when you remind yourself that it costs only \u00a369 outright (or free on a contract).</p> <p>Sales of 3's first model have been expanding fast from a small base, but are still only a bit over 100,000 units - a minnow in an ocean of giant fish. It is hoping that word of mouth will eventually propel it to a tipping point where people want to get one because their friends have one. This is a very tough market to crack, but it is a very cost-effective product. It would be a tragedy, however, if we end up with two competing systems - Skype versus all the non-proprietary ones - which don't talk to each other.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:vic.keegan@theguardian.com\">vic.keegan@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Usain Bolt was just nine years old when his hero Michael Johnson set the 200m world record at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996. Yesterday, on the eve of his 22nd birthday, Bolt smashed it. The Jamaican sprinter rocketed to the finish line at the Bird's Nest stadium in 19.30 seconds, beating Johnson's time by two-hundredths of a second, and assuring himself a place in Olympic history books by becoming the first man to break world records while winning 100m and 200m races at a single games.</p> <p>It was a flawless performance from the young man who only four days earlier became an instant global star when he smashed the 100m world record, in spite of starting his victory celebrations virtually 20 metres from the finish. In the 200m - his main event - he drove off the bend and this time kept going to the line.</p> <p>Michael Johnson, now a BBC commentator, said: \"He got an incredible start. I just went 'Wow'. It was a much more amazing start than he got in the 100m and his turn was just absolutely fabulous.\" Laughing uproariously as his own record fell, Johnson said: \"He is Superman 2!\"</p> <p>Bolt, in his shiny gold Puma trainers, wound his way around the stadium as dancehall tunes blared, and said: \"My name is Lightning Bolt.\" </p> <p>Though Bolt's name was new to all but athletics fans before the 100m final on Saturday, he is no stranger to success. The athlete who is now the undisputed fastest man on earth, born in 1986 in the tiny farming community of Coxheath in the Trelawny, northern Jamaica, first wowed international athletics crowds at the world junior championships in 2002 in Jamaica. There, in front of a home crowd, the 15-year-old Bolt, who was already at his full adult height of 6ft 5in, won the 200m in 20.61sec, becoming the youngest ever world junior champion and earning him that Lightning Bolt nickname. It wasn't until Michael Johnson was 20 that he could run so fast.</p> <p>He made it to the Athens games as a teenager four years ago, but failed to make the final of the 200m. Nonetheless, American universities offered him scholarships on the strength of his raw talent, but he turned them down to attend the University of Technology in Jamaica, chiselling his amazing physique in the primitive weights room.</p> <p>Bolt is the tallest sprinter to ever hold the 100m world record, and his frame is a key reason for his success, Johnson said. \"He has incredible speed and an incredibly long stride. That affords him the ability to cover more ground with every stride the way no one else can.\"</p> <p>Indeed, when Bolt beat the hotly tipped American Tyson Gay in May at the Reebok Grand Prix in New York - setting the world record of 9.72, which he beat in Beijing - he used only 41\u00bd strides to beat Gay, who needed 45.</p> <p>But Bolt wasn't always set to be a sprinter. Cricket was his first love. He stood out as a fast bowler playing for William Knibb High School in Trelawny, and only ditched his cricket whites when his coach, seeing how fast he could run, suggested he have a go at athletics. </p> <p>Despite Bolt's serious talent, he has a reputation for being a rather laid-back chap. Not only did he slow down in his record-breaking 100m, but his left shoelace was undone. Beforehand, he warmed up in his shorts, while his competitors wore tracksuit bottoms, following the conventional wisdom that athletes should keep themselves as warm as possible before a big race. What's more, he defied nutritionists by eating two meals of chicken nuggets before the race. But according to his dad, it is his love of yams which has really propelled him to stardom. \"It is definitely the Trelawny yam,\" Wellesley Bolt told reporters. The yam grown in Trelawny is one of the staples for citizens of the area, who believe that it has medicinal properties.</p> <p>Bolt's family haven't made the trek to Beijing, but more than 100 people have crammed into their home, less than 30 minutes drive from Montego Bay, to watch their boy run.</p> <p>\"My house has been taken over by more than 100 people from inside and outside the community,\" said Bolt Snr after the 100m. \"They are waving flags, beating drums and just making a lot of noise. But this is a special moment and to know that a Jamaican has done this and I am the</p> <p>father of that Jamaican makes me feel special. I never expected him to break the world record, but I am proud of my son.\"</p> <p>What next for Bolt, whose next stop after Beijing will be Zurich on Friday week for the Weltklasse grand prix? After his astonishingly casual performance in the 100m, it seems inevitable that he will break his own record again before long. \"Who knows how fast he can go?\" said his coach Glen Mills. \"Obviously from the race, he can go faster than the 9.69. He was having fun in the last 20m, celebrating and breaking the world record. That's awesome. You can read into it ... he can probably go under 9.60, but I am not good at predictions. I just love to see things unfold.\"</p> <p>If it all goes wrong, or Bolt gets bored, he has another interest: computers. \"I am looking at going into computing,\" he told one interviewer in 2004. </p> <p>But is he ready for superstardom? \"I'm getting ready,\" he grinned.</p> <h2>At a glance</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Bolt celebrates his 22nd birthday today in Beijing. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> He is 1.96m tall (6ft 5in) and weighs 86kg (13st 7lb). </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Bolt finished the 100m in 9.69 seconds and the 200m in 19.30 seconds - setting two new world records. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> He is the first sprinter to run the 100m below 9.7 seconds without wind assistance. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> He takes between 40 and 41 strides to complete the 100m; in comparison bronze medallist Walter Dix takes 47. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> His left shoe was untied during his record-breaking 100m. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> He is the first man since Carl Lewis in 1984 to win the sprint double of both the 100m and 200m events.</p>",
  "<p>Olympic sports federations and National Olympic Committees across the world stand to make on average \u00a3750,000 more a year each as a result of London hosting the 2012 Olympics.</p> <p>London's Games are set to raise \u00a3750m more for Olympic sport worldwide than Beijing. With the British Olympic Association groaning under the weight of a seven-figure pre-tax loss last year, the windfall will come as a welcome relief.</p> <p>For the winter-summer Olympic cycle in Turin and Beijing the International Olympic Committee earned less than \u00a31.9bn in combined sponsorship and broadcast revenues. Several major broadcast and commercial deals expire after the Beijing closing ceremony and the IOC's marketing and broadcast executive, Timo Lumme, said it was on course for huge uplift. </p> <p>The IOC reinvests its incomes into sport, with 92% of revenues from the Games going to international federations and National Olympic Committees. It has already struck broadcast deals for London 2012 worth almost \u00a32bn. By also expanding its nine-partner portfolio of top-tier sponsors, such as Coca-Cola, to about a dozen, it expects also to generate another \u00a3600m minimum from sponsors over the next four years. That will generate total broadcast and sponsorship revenue for the IOC of at least \u00a32.7bn, providing Olympic sports with a funding bonanza that will be as welcome at British Olympic HQ as anywhere.</p> <p><strong>China's big screen break</strong></p> <p>China might be topping the medal table at its home Games but the biggest winner here has been its state broadcaster, CCTV. Incredibly, as part of a long-term deal struck in the early 1990s, China pays only a fraction of Asia's $18.5m (\u00a310m) total contribution to broadcast rights. So CCTV has turned a profit of about \u00a3200m in advertising revenues from these Olympics, with not a penny of it going back to sport.<br><strong><br>Getting sums wrong</strong></p> <p>Politicians' lack of perspective over financial issues has been exposed yet again with the government's preposterous announcement that it hopes to raise \u00a379m for British Olympic sport from the private sector. On offer are naming rights for the Olympic facilities but Arsenal, a global brand, receive only \u00a33m a year for title sponsorship of their stadium from Emirates. And government hopes that the marketable Beijing medal-winners will participate in promotional programmes look equally forlorn. Athletes must pay back a pound of their \u00a320,000-plus UK Sport funding for every one they earn over \u00a354,000 in a year. So there is no incentive for them to help swell government coffers when it has already guaranteed all athletes their Olympic funding.<br><strong><br>Twenty20's 2020 bid</strong></p> <p>While the 50-over format continues to writhe in the agonies of its slow death, the International Cricket Council is trying to prepare an Olympic future for its more successful Twenty20 incarnation. The ICC's president, David Morgan, has been in Beijing this week, schmoozing the IOC's members in an effort to win election to the Olympic family in time for the 2020 Games. The former England &amp; Wales Cricket Board chairman has been relying on the ECB's chief executive, David Collier, a board member of the International Hockey Federation, who has full Olympic accreditation.</p> <p><strong>Wiggins' new ride</strong></p> <p>Bradley Wiggins has been a British icon here, winning two gold medals in the track cycling. And he brought typical British values to his celebrations in Beijing, emerging from a reception at the 2012 promotional venue, London House, in the early hours and rolling over the bonnet of a waiting taxi. The driver, understandably, took exception. Although the police intervened, everything was resolved when the driver spotted Wiggins's medals and was granted a photo opportunity with London's cycling ambassador. </p>",
  "<p>Kamila Shamsie (Musharraf was the last to read the writing on the wall, August 19) displays an all-too-common naivety about how poverty in countries like Pakistan makes a nonsense of things like democracy and institutional development, including the judiciary. Pakistan has always been in a dismal state. We have never, to take just one example, devoted more than 2% of our GDP to education. This did not change under Benazir Bhutto, under Nawaz Sharif, or under Musharraf. Our ruling elites must first make a commitment to higher standards of honesty. So far, they have shown little or no understanding of the stark alternatives facing Pakistan: to become able to compete in the global marketplace, or end up like Afghanistan.</p> <p>Nations make progress when their ruling elites can unlock the energy that drives the people forward as a community in a shared endeavour. To do this, resources must be allocated in a more or less equitable fashion, so that the poorest sections of society are not left out.<br><strong>Hashim Ahmed</strong><br>Islamabad, Pakistan</p> <p>Kamila Shamsie writes about \"the degree of economic wealth and influence the top brass [of the Pakistani army] has garnered for itself\". If it weren't the army, perhaps the wealth and influence could have been garnered by a private company, as is the case in India. In Mumbai, Mukesh Ambani, head of half of the Reliance organisation, is building a 27-storey monstrosity to house himself, five family members and 600 staff at a cost of $1bn.

  "<p>BAA is unlikely to be short of bidders if the Competition Commission forces it to sell three of its seven airports but the price may prove a problem.</p> <p>Changi Airports International, which is owned by the Singapore government, expressed cautious interest yesterday and is unlikely to be alone.</p> <p>\"We are open to evaluating the deal, but we will wait to see if the terms are attractive,\" said a Changi Airports spokeswoman.</p> <p>A host of other companies headed by the German group Hochtief, the Manchester Airport Group, Macquarie, Global Infrastructure Partners and Spain's Abertis, which owns Luton, Cardiff and Belfast airports, are all seen as possible contenders - though Abertis's ownership of Luton could prove a stumbling block to its purchase of one of BAA's London airports.</p> <p>The commission has made it clear that if it did force BAA to sell two of its three London airports it would not allow them to go to the same buyer. It will also make sure that bidders have the financial resources and experience of airport management.</p> <p>Though any sale is likely to be more than a year away, the aviation industry is facing hard times amid soaring fuel bills and slowing economic growth. </p> <p>As BAA reported recently, its airports handled a total of 14.8 million passengers last month, a drop of 1.7% on July last year. The weakening economic climate, rising airfares and airline capacity cuts meant that each airport in the group and most major markets lost ground in July.</p> <p>In a research note yesterday, Andrew Fitchie, an analyst at Collins Stewart, wrote: \"On the one hand, there are plenty of funds out there with money to invest in airports. However, on the other hand, airport valuations have fallen (reflecting tighter credit conditions and a more uncertain aviation environment) and it's never good to be a forced seller. We would also expect the uncertainty of changes [toughening] to the regulatory model would weigh down on potential value.\"</p> <p>Ashley Steel, the head of KPMG's infrastructure practice, warned: \"Meaningful valuations will be tricky to achieve in the current market, though the infrastructure sector has been holding good value.</p> <p>\"Unravelling the airports from BAA - so that they are in a position to be sold - will also be a mammoth task, requiring careful handling.</p> <p>\"There will be enormous structural difficulties [involving technology, property, data, people contractors, service providers, pensions etc] in separation. Managing these whilst continuing to operate the airports will not be straightforward.\"</p>",
  "<p>It's taken decades for the message to get through, but at last we are turning to greener motoring. The demand for hybrid cars in the UK is at an all-time high and waiting lists for the proven technology are long.</p> <p>In Japan, drivers have been shaken so seriously by the oil shocks that they became the first in the developed world to experience declining car ownership. They are also poised to benefit from the biggest experiment with electric cars since the milk float.</p> <p>This is all terribly green and worthy, but these solutions mean forking out for another car. Wouldn't it be better to adapt our existing vehicles? And while giving up our gas-guzzlers is one thing, what should we do with the billions of old-tech cars already on the road? After all, simply to scrap them means building new cars. As Conor Faughnan of the AA points out: \"Most of the pollution associated with cars actually relates to their construction.\"</p> <p><strong>In first gear</strong></p> <p>A Japanese start-up company says it might have the answer. It is proposing to retrofit our existing cars with tiny hydrogen generators that work off the car exhaust and supplement existing combustion.</p> <p>Makoto Okuda, director of Hrein Energy, says: \"Adding about 3% of hydrogen to the intake air results in a lean burn, which has never been made possible with gasoline alone.\" His company, based in Hokkaido, develops systems to make, store and supply hydrogen. He says \"We have improved fuel efficiency by 30% and reduced CO2 emissions by 30% in recent tests.\" Now working with Japanese carmakers, Okuda says he hopes to have a system on the market in two to three years.</p> <p>The beauty of the new system is that it employs the otherwise wasted heat generated by car engines - up to 40% in some cases - to convert an easily transportable liquid organic hydride (a hydrogen-storing chemical) into a gaseous state. This hydrogen is then added to the intake air resulting, says Okuda, in reduced emissions.</p> <p>The emissions are so low, claims the company, that they will conform to the new EU regulations expected on CO2 emissions in 2012. Hrein suggests retro-fitting all cars with the system.</p> <p>Scientists agree that transporting hydrogen in a liquid state makes more sense than filling up from service stations equipped to handle frozen hydrogen.</p> <p>\"Hydrogen does have fantastic potential, says Faye Sunderland of <a href=\"http://www.greencarwebsite.co.uk\">greencarwebsite.co.uk</a>. \"Retail network distribution is always a problem with new alternative fuels. A UK company called ITM recently announced they had developed a home refuelling unit for hydrogen cars. So a solution is forming.\"</p> <p>Says Sunderland: \"The key problem with hydrogen technology so far has been retail distribution of hydrogen and economic and environmental viability of the technology. So far hydrogen has been held back because the easiest way to produce hydrogen was to burn fossil fuels which meant the well-to-wheel CO2 emissions were actually higher than if you just put the fossil fuels directly into the car. As a result, it was a bit of an expensive non-starter.\"</p> <p>Hrein says all its hydrogen production comes from wind-generated sources on Hokkaido, Japan's most northerly island. But although Japan is the home of the hybrid and host to more electric plug-in cars than the rest of the planet put together, as well as being a leader in the number of hydrogen outlets for vehicles, renewable energy is not something Japan has been strong on so far. There are doubts about whether it would be possible to scale up renewable operations to meet the demand necessary for all this hydrogen needed to be mixed with petro-fuel at service stations. </p> <p>Hydrogen storing technology, however, does have potential, according to papers published on the technology since the 1970s. The system, they generally conclude, \"appears feasible\". </p> <p>\"Organic hydrides are a high-efficiency high-density storage media for hydrogen,\" says Masaru Ichikawa of Hokkaido University, who worked with Hrein on the formula. \"The end product can be transported alongside petrol in fuel delivery lorries and deposited at petrol stations just like today's conventional fuels.\"</p> <p>But if the technology has been available since the 1970s, asks John Turner, a research fellow at the US's National Renewable Energy Laboratory, why didn't the automakers turn to it to provide themselves with an edge over competitors?</p> <p><strong>Dirty work</strong></p> <p>\"Conspiracy theories aside, the automakers have some very smart engineers and if they see something that will easily give them a 30% boost in fuel economy then they are going to take a hard look at it,\" he says. \"Modifying an existing technology, unless it is mandated by some government agency, will not likely go anywhere.\"</p> <p>Hrein, with its take on delivering a little hydrogen to clean up the dirty work of gasoline, may be about to do that, according to the company's representative in the UK. Hrein is talking to the UK government to discuss bringing the technology to the UK. Should Downing Street give the system a green light, it could provide a stopgap in the march towards the zero emission car. It would certainly provide many of us who can only afford second-hand bangers with a cleaner conscience, if not a cleaner engine.</p>",
  "<p>It has taken more than two decades of operations as a private company and two years of detailed investigation, but the Competition Commission has finally concurred with what the vast majority of domestic airlines and millions of air passengers have known for years: BAA's monopoly of the UK's big airports is a very bad idea that has turned flying into a form of torture. </p> <p>Once, the firm that attracted the most widespread vilification and opprobrium among consumers was Railtrack. Now, without doubt, it is BAA - at least for the 90% of air travellers in the south- east and 84% in Scotland who have little choice but to use its grotty, overcrowded airports if they want to fly.</p> <p>The commission's report has pointed the finger at BAA for failing to lobby effectively for expansion. Three of its seven airports - probably Gatwick and Stansted, and Glasgow or Edinburgh - will now have to be sold. But at least for several years to come, and for whoever eventually buys the three airports, the watchdog's findings are unlikely to ease the pain of airline passengers.</p> <p>It could be quite simple and quick to address some of the things that really matter to passengers, such as the interminable queues for check-in and security, the squalid lavatories, the rip-off car parks, gaudy in-your-face shopping malls and departure gates where passengers must sit on the floor.</p> <p>Big improvements would be possible to all of the above with more resources and different priorities. But the chances of BAA caring about such little things now are almost zero. So we must hope for long-term change instead. The commission acknowledges that it is capacity that is the major factor preventing better service for airlines and passengers. The earliest possible date for a new London runway is 2015 for Stansted. A third runway at Heathrow would not happen for at least 12 years. </p> <p>The commission reckons a new owner or two might make a rather better fist of what is already available. But that depends on who buys the airports. In a bid to keep out opportunistic investment bank bidders, any buyer will have to have both financial clout and airport management experience.</p> <p>But that won't mean Goldman Sachs can't sign up a few airport professionals and slap an offer on the table. There will likely be sovereign wealth funds keen to own a trophy asset such as Heathrow and there are certainly infrastructure funds with cash to invest, although the airport owner Macquarie is currently selling rather than buying to cut debt. But the environment has changed markedly in the last year. Aside from tighter credit conditions, there is a more uncertain outlook for the aviation sector and there are likely to be changes to regulation. </p> <p>In any case, why does the commission think a new debt-funded corporate owner will necessarily be any better than BAA? Many of the best overseas airports against which the London airports compare so unfavourably are state-owned. A new corporate owner will still want to make the best return possible for its shareholders.</p> <p>And the last time the commission demanded the wholesale sell-off of assets to other operators was the Beer Orders, nearly 20 years ago. They backfired almost completely when the giant breweries, judged over-powerful, were merely replaced by giant pub groups.</p> <p>The real issue for BAA, as the government's 2003 white paper showed, is that airports and aviation are fast becoming a public policy issue of the highest priority. According to the business lobby, a third runway at Heathrow is the top priority, but the government should not automatically buy that argument just because Sir Nigel Rudd and his CBI chums are banging on about it. They argue that if Heathrow can't expand then Schiphol or Frankfurt will step up and steal our flights.</p> <p>Well maybe. Or perhaps views other than the impact on big business are now more important. The environmental damage caused by air travel is a far bigger issue than it was when the third runway debate first started. And the price of oil has changed the economics of aviation. It is not a given that London wants another runway and the pollution that goes with it when a third of those arriving at Heathrow are transit passengers who do not contribute to the UK economy.</p> <p>Arguably airports, like railways, are a vital part of the country's infrastructure. And perhaps, in the same way as Railtrack was reinvented as Network Rail, the airport infrastructure should be operated by a not-for-dividend organisation.</p> <p>For Ferrovial, the Spanish group that acquired BAA two years ago, it is not a happy outcome. They paid a top dollar enterprise value of \u00a319bn for BAA and are now likely to have to accept fire-sale prices for three airports. </p> <p>However, they did plough ahead with the bid even after the OFT's initial competition investigation was announced, so it is not as though they did not know what might hit them.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:julia.finch@theguardian.com\">julia.finch@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<h2>Watching the IT pennies</h2> <p>Generalising IT spend among various and disparate public bodies to reveal just one newsworthy sum will surely only serve to heap yet more pressure on the sector (Public bodies will have to watch their IT spending, August 14). Surely it is disingenuous to bundle money spent by the MoD with that by a local authority, for example. Public bodies have always been tasked with keeping a keen eye on IT spend.

This means mains electricity - though it might come from solar panels. And of course hybrid cars charge their batteries on the go using their petrol, CO2-emitting engines. Meanwhile I would be interested to find out the energy economics of electric cars charged from fossil fuel power plants - surely with all the losses in converting gas/coal to heat to steam to motive power to electricity, then via power cables to user, must produce more CO2 per mile than burning petrol/diesel in car engines?<br><strong>Michael Miller, </strong>Sheffield </p> <h2>Risky business</h2> <p>Does Pete Warren have exemption from the Data Protection legislation (Snapshots of our secret lives, August 14)?

  "<p>We don't know: it's a secret. However, Microsoft has finally started to talk about its next operating system via a new blog called <a href=\"http://www.bit.ly/windows7\">Engineering Windows 7</a>. This is being written by the top two people on the project, senior vice-presidents Steve Sinofsky and Jon DeVaan.</p> <p>So far, the plan appears to be to underpromise and overdeliver - the opposite of what happened with Vista. But Microsoft will soon have to spill the beans. Its huge Professional Developers Conference (PDC) will start on October 27, with the Windows Hardware Engineering Conference (WinHEC) following on.</p> <p>Microsoft can't keep its plans secret, because its business depends on more than 10,000 PC manufacturers developing hardware to run it and millions of software developers writing and testing their programs. It therefore tends to give PDC and WinHEC attendees code. </p> <p>In any case, several million people will be beta testing Windows 7, so every aspect will be explored in depth before it's launched. It's not as though it could spring any surprises by selling Windows 7 exclusively on Microsoft hardware from exclusive Microsoft stores.</p> <p>Still, Windows 7 may feature a SuperBar - a reworking of the old TaskBar - and the \"touch\" features familiar from the Tablet PC and UMPC (ultramobile) versions will be expanded to include multi-touch as standard. There should also be new versions of Internet Explorer 8 and Windows Media Center, and possibly of Paint and WordPad.</p> <p>But as with Vista, Microsoft will probably make many new features available to user of earlier operating systems, perhaps even before the launch.</p> <p>Otherwise, it's not in Microsoft's interests to change much: its main buyers are extremely conservative. They want to run millions of old programs, no matter how poorly designed and badly written. Ultimately it boils down to how much ground Microsoft is willing to give up, if any: it can always make Windows more compatible by making it worse.</p> <p>But ideally, Microsoft will draw a line in the sand with the 64bit versions of Windows, which started with Windows 2000. It seems 64bit Vista is now making rapid progress thanks to the availability of cheap RAM. While 32bit XP is limited to using a little over 3GB of memory, 64bit Vista machines typically use between 4GB and 8GB or more. The Window Server market has already moved to 64bit versions, for access to large banks of memory, and desktop users will eventually follow.</p> <p>Then backwards compatibility is solved in a different way. You have a multi-core processor, so just give that bad application its own virtual environment, where it can't hurt anything else. Virtualisation is the future, and Microsoft has the technology. But will enough of it be included in Windows 7?</p>",
  "<p>When Russian tanks rolled into Georgia, it brought back memories of Soviet-era military conquest - a reminder of the cold war. But whether by accident or design, the fight for South Ossettia appears to have given us a taste of the future as well, with internet attacks on Georgian computer systems resulting in theories about 21st-century warfare spilling out everywhere. The BBC said the situation represented a \"virtual echo of battles being fought on the ground\", while <a href=\"http://www.Slate.com\">Slate.com</a>'s Evgeny Morozov even enlisted as a Russian cybersoldier to see what was really happening. But while the past fortnight has seen plenty of conjecture, there's been very little hard evidence about the conflict that's taking place in cyberspace. </p> <p>We do know a few things, though. After the military situation escalated, some prominent Georgian websites came under attack - though right now we cannot quite be sure where the strikes came from. We also know that the Georgian government enlisted the help of the regional experts in Estonia (themselves hardly bosom pals with Russia) as well as using the might of Google as a deterrent by shifting some important government websites on to <a href=\"http://www.Blogger.com\">Blogger.com</a>.</p> <p>Everything beyond this has largely been the product of rumour or chin-scratching - which, in turn, has led to some backlash. Ethan Zuckerman, a fellow at Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet and Society, is scathing about the idea that online battles can have a big role to play in war. \"It's worth remembering that in this 'cyberwar', the most serious consequence is that a website becomes temporarily inaccessible to viewers,\" he wrote on his blog. \"It's a war being fought with paintballs, not with live rounds.\" In some ways he's right to be snooty - after all, when people are dying, a blocked web connection is pretty insignificant. </p> <p>But the long-term threat of online attack, particularly on countries that try to use the net to leapfrog the developmental cycles that the western world takes for granted, is growing. Remember: if the low-cost, global-reach approach of the internet helps governments to accelerate economic development, it also leaves them too reliant on the public system. That's a potentially perilous situation - just look at Estonia, which saw its entire banking system struck by a denial of service attack last year. As enemies probe for weakness, we're only going to see more of this in the future.</p> <p>I think the real problem isn't understanding the damage a cyberwar could cause, but in grasping what it really looks like. It's an odd concept because even in these days of international terrorism, we're still used to the idea of military coordination. Instead, many of these strikes seem to be cases of so-called \"hacktivism\": gangs of angry nationalists and script kiddies who launch ad hoc strikes on their \"enemies\" as part of a propaganda push. And the troubling thing is that this sort of collective grassroots movement - a sort of \"click for victory\" campaign - isn't the hi-tech descendant of the local militia, but the inheritor of the internet's worst excesses. </p> <p>Because while it's easy to imagine internet conflict in terms of the wars we're used to in history - grand struggles between two opposing sides - this isn't organised conflict. In fact, it's hardly even guerrilla warfare. It, like the fringes of the internet, is pure chaos - peopled by bullies. Indeed, the angry cybernationalists of Russia and elsewhere have less in common with their nation's armies than they do with the other griefers who make online life a misery. They're the geopolitical equivalent of the childish \"anonymous\" collective who swarm over messageboards and websites - a mob of untraceable louts who cause havoc for no real reason other than they can. Think of them as unruly, unhinged and unrepentant - just like the worst trolls you've encountered. </p> <p>Right now we think we can understand them because they're fighting nationalist wars, when the truth is that in the future they could turn their gaze in any direction they feel like. And that, above all else, is what makes cyberwar a truly frightening prospect. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:bobbie.johnson@theguardian.com\">bobbie.johnson@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Within 10 years New Yorkers may be walking over the Brooklyn Bridge beneath gently whirring turbines, and gazing up at the Empire State Building topped by a giant windmill. </p> <p>Mayor Michael Bloomberg is calling for the city to become a major generator of renewable energy. He wants to see New York wean itself from dependency on the conventional power grid by massive investment in wind, solar and wave energy and opened the prospect of wind turbines being placed on bridges and skyscrapers, in a way that could transform the city's skyline.</p> <p>As a symbol of the change he had in mind, he conjured up the vision of the Statue of Liberty \"powered by an ocean wind farm\". That would be a \"thing of beauty\", he said.</p> <p>Bloomberg unveiled his radical plans at an alternative energy conference in Las Vegas. His ambition is to use a combination of renewable power sources, focusing on the natural qualities of the city.</p> <p>The high-rise nature of Manhattan made wind turbines atop skyscrapers an obvious thought, though Bloomberg conceded there would be aesthetic concerns: \"There's a lot of logistical as well as aesthetic considerations. If there is a large ape that starts climbing the Empire State Building, it might get in his way.\"</p> <p>The plans also focus on the possibility of turbines scattered along the windy coastlines of Queens, Brooklyn and Long Island that could generate 10% of the city's power needs within a decade.</p> <p>Wind farms are also mooted far out to sea, possibly up to 25 miles offshore where they would rest beyond sight, as well as solar panels across public and private rooftops.</p> <p>The mayor has invited private companies to submit innovative ideas and designs that would meet his brief. As part of his search for new thinking he has met with T. Boone Pickens, the oil tycoon who is building the world's largest wind farm in the Texan panhandle.</p> <p>The plans form part of Bloomberg's ambition to keep New York's energy consumption at today's levels despite projections of substantial population growth. He has set a target to cut the city's emissions of greenhouse gases by athird by 2030.</p> <p>However, the mayor is in a race against the clock and has only until January 2010, when his term ends, to turn his dreams into a reality. \"When it comes to producing clean power, we're determined to make New York the No 1 city in the nation,\" Bloomberg said.</p>",
  "<p> Peter Moore has been promising it since he took up his tenure as president of EA Sports - a sports sim that reacts to the events in its real-world counterpart. Madden already features regular roster updates, but now footie is getting in on the act. EA announced today that FIFA 09 purchasers will be able to sign up to a weekly update service, which updates the in-game stats based on occurrences in the English Premier League, La Liga BBVA, Ligue 1, Bundesliga, Serie A and Mexican Primera Division. From the press release:</p> <blockquote> <br> <p>The adidas Live Season service is based on how real players performed in the most recent real-world matches. Gameplay will change dynamically as the performance of players and football teams in the real world experience the highs and lows during their campaigns.</p> </blockquote> <br> <blockquote> <br> <p>A global network of football scouts will monitor every player in the adidas Live Season leagues throughout the season to supply accurate and in-depth player and team data each week. Player attributes will be impacted and player performance will change dynamically. The adidas Live Season service is downloaded into FIFA 09 each week and will run from the launch of the game to the end of the 2008-2009 season.</p> </blockquote> <br> <p>Ah, but there's an interesting wrinkle. The release points out that gamers get 'a free trial' to one league of their choice, until the close of the 2008-2009 season. After this, there will be a weekly subscription, which EA has not yet disclosed.</p> <p>Of course, this all ties in with the publisher's determination to create new revenue streams away from the traditional, expensive and risky retail model. Inspired by the Korean market, the company is already exploring billed downloadable content - hence the controversy over Bad Company, and the forthcoming Battlefield Heroes.</p> <p>EA is also keen on building a more 'intimate' relationship with its fanbase. At the moment the relationship between FIFA fans and FIFA publisher is confined to an annual purchase and maybe an email newsletter. But with weekly downloads, a much closer bond can be developed, and this bond alone - regardless of any subscription fee - can be monetised. Hence the Adidas sponsorship.</p> <p>The question is, how many gamers actually want their FIFA experience to be shaded by the vagaries of the real footie season? As A Man City supporter, I'd like to play Valeri Bojinov upfront, but if I downloaded the update, would he be out of action for six months? As for player form - this has been fictionalised for years in PES and FIFA; would a realistically timed version be any more compelling? It would perhaps, save keen football followers the chore of having to analyse in-game player stats to check who's in tip-top condition and who's coasting - just watch Match of the Day instead.</p> <p>The next step will be downloadable football boots, alice bands and goal celebrations. Then, the user-generated angle: customisable crowd chants, pitch patterns and commentary.</p> <p>Will you be partaking?</p>",
  "<p>One extremely interested observer in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/georgia\">war between Russia and Georgia</a> hasn't vocally taken sides in the conflict. Given the war's timing, you might call this country's interest \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 in the conflict \"sporting\". But in reality, Georgia versus Russia provides a convenient simulation for this great power's options of dealing with the western backed irritant on its own perimeter.</p> <p>Beyond the combatants and other former Soviet Republics, no nation is more interested in the Russia-Georgia conflict's global fallout than China. China's relationship with Taiwan resembles Russia's ties to Georgia. In both situations, the big state feels a sense of grievance over the very existence of its puny neighbour and resents outsiders that act as its self-appointed protectors.</p> <p>The Caucuses conflict offers China a realistic model for what it can expect if it the Taiwan situation turns violent. The parallels aren't perfect, but there's a close enough fit for China to pay very close attention, particularly to the international consequences of Russia's humiliation of Georgia. With China watching, the US and it allies need to get their response to Russia absolutely right.</p> <p>The crisis may have its roots in a failure to communicate. Georgia and its president Mikheil Saakashvili may have grossly overestimated the west's commitment to defending its borders and interests. Saakashvili may have equated the west's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/20/georgia.nato?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=networkfront\">promise of Nato membership</a> with mutual defence benefits. Or, at least, Saakashvili may have believed that Russia believed the west would fight for Georgia. Although the <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0808/Obama_also_cites_NATO_membership_for_Georgia.html\">US insists Georgia is still a candidate for Nato</a>, it's now comedic or criminal to imagine putting a Georgian finger on the trigger to set American, British, French, German and other European troops firing on Russian forces. </p> <p>Shift the focus to Taiwan, an island that China considers a renegade province, and the proposition seems equally ludicrous, while the scope for miscalculation appears similarly broad. America has been purposely vague about what it would do in the event of a mainland military threat to Taiwan and its 23 million people. A dozen years ago, China conducted <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Taiwan_Strait_Crisis\">missile tests in the Taiwan Strait</a> ahead of Taiwan's first presidential election. As unbelievable as that seems, it's even more incredible to recall that the US sent an aircraft carrier group warning China to back off.</p> <p>Today Taiwan is a de facto separate country, while China claims it's still part of the nation. Keeping the peace relies on both governments preserving the status quo: China won't attempt reunification by force, and Taiwan won't move toward official independence. Within those rules, everyone trades and invests together peacefully. But rules are made to be broken, and even if nobody explicitly crosses the line, ticklish situations can arise. For example, China could decide that Taiwan's ambition to join the World Trade Organisation constitutes a move toward independence.</p> <p>When Russian foreign minister <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080814/pl_afp/georgiarussiaconflictus_080814093918\">Sergey Lavrov urged the US to choose</a> between \"support for a virtual project\" in Georgia and its \"real partnership\" with Russia on key issues such as nuclear negotiations with Iran and North Korea, he could have been China's foreign minister Yang Jiechi speaking about the US, China and Taiwan. The unprecedented turnout of world leaders for the Olympics in Beijing indicates that the global establishment desperately wants \"real partnership\" with China. It's hard to imagine that Taiwan would be allowed to interfere. </p> <p>Deepened economic ties between the US, EU and China over the past decade mean all sides have more to lose in a conflict. While moving toward a consumer economy, China still remains heavily dependent on exports to developed countries. Developed economies depend on China for cheap goods to meet consumer demand while controlling inflation and maximising corporate profits. With bricks and mortar investment in the mainland, western companies would risk expropriation in the event of a crisis. China also holds trillions of dollars in US Treasury securities, which it could dump on the market to depress US bond prices and raise Uncle Sam's financing costs. A fire sale of Treasury notes would cost China dearly, so the holding acts as a sort of financial mutual suicide pact neither side wants to test.</p> <p>Russia's huge energy reserves may give it even greater economic leverage than China, especially over Europe. Therefore Russia may get off a little easier than China would for its military excesses. If the US and EU show spine despite this leverage, then China can expect to pay a bigger price.</p> <p>China will particularly be watching threats to punish Russia in international organisations and institutions, where China participates more deeply than Russia. While Russia hopes to join the WTO, China entered it in 2001, boosting foreign investment exponentially and making economic reform seem irreversible. Sanctions would be embarrassing, but also potentially harmful to investment and trade. </p> <p>\"If Russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in Georgia, the US-Russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come,\" US defence secretary <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/15/world/europe/15policy.html\">Robert Gates warned</a> last Thursday. That's tough talk, but so far, there's only been talk and empty ceasefire proposals as Russia has advanced beyond disputed territory into Georgia proper. There's \"no prospect\" of US military intervention, Gates added emphatically. The Russians are writing the script here. The US and EU are in no position to edit it, and it would be hard for China not to notice. </p> <p>Russia benefits because the US is involved in two wars already and has neither the troops nor the stomach for a third. China may be tempted to act soon, while US commitments and its need for China's help on North Korea and other issues are great. But the US can still muster more than blankets and cots in response to aggression.</p> <p>Today's signing of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/worldlatest/story/0,,-7738829,00.html\">US-Poland agreement on missile defence</a> and mutual defence is a reminder that the US has some weapons to counter Russian ambitions. For China, it's a reminder that assertiveness on Taiwan will trigger reactions from its neighbours. The two biggest neighbours, US allies Japan and South Korea, have long histories of hostility toward China. Additionally, other countries on its flanks, including Southeast Asia could be spooked by military action in Taiwan. Imagine Vietnam reopening the naval base at Cam Rahn Bay to its old enemy the US in response to China's belligerence. </p> <p>The most hopeful sign of avoiding a replay of the Georgian war between China and Taiwan is warming cross-strait relations, particularly since Ma Ying-jeou took office as Taiwan's president in May. The better the two sides get along, the less likely outsiders can tempt either side to throw a spanner into the works. The outcome in Georgia will illustrate the cost of miscalculation. </p> <p>If Russia humiliates Georgia at little cost, it could inspire China to press Taiwan when the opportunity beckons. Taiwan's allies, like Georgia's, are eager to remain friends with the big player neighbour and not eager for a fight. If the current sunshine over the Taiwan Strait gives way to clouds, that could drive the little player to do something desperate, as Georgia did, before it loses whatever leverage it has, and China to take advantage of the opening.</p> <p>To avoid a replay, the US need to show Taiwan and China that it wants to be a dependable friend to each, but that friendship depends on following the rules. That means Russia and Georgia both have to pay a price for their misadventure in the Caucuses. Otherwise, Taiwan will pay a far bigger one.</p>",
  "<p>The debate on the future of aviation in the UK gives rise to some hugely controversial issues, but one thing is very clear: we need to make Heathrow better. We need a top-class airport serving the south-east and the UK as a whole. Heathrow has become a national embarrassment. Virtually all the airlines are hugely critical of the performance of its owner BAA. As for the passenger experience, I am certain that there are few people who have used BAA's airports without experiencing the travel misery of lost bags, long queues and poor customer service. </p> <p>The Conservative party has been leading the debate on this issue. In <a href=\"http://www.theresavilliers.co.uk/article/?id=288\">summer 2007</a>, I called for BAA, the owners of Gatwick, Stansted and Heathrow, to be broken up. Too often they provide a dismal level of service. Allowing passengers and airlines to vote with their feet by giving them a choice of airports run by different operators will help drive improvements in service quality. </p> <p>For example, in keeping the overflow staff car parks shut on the day Terminal 5 opened, the most important day for Heathrow for a generation, BAA was making the sort of basic error that one is much more likely to see from a monopolist than a company subject to tough competitive pressure on a daily basis. And it seems clear that frustrated passengers had to put up with the rule restricting hand luggage to one bag over so many months, not because this was vital for safety, but because BAA took so long to recruit and train the staff necessary to deal with new rules on security checks. </p> <p>So I am delighted that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/20/baa.theairlineindustry\">Competition Commission</a> has recommended that BAA sell off Gatwick and Stansted. I believe that was a victory for passengers and should do a great deal to improve service quality. </p> <p>However, Heathrow has such a large share of the airport market that a robust regulatory structure will still be needed even if BAA no longer owns Gatwick or Stansted. That is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/20/baa.theairlineindustry2\">why the commission</a> is absolutely right to be considering what they call \"other behavioural remedies\" to tackle the problems at the UK's largest airport.</p> <p>One option that needs to be seriously considered is the model where terminals run by different operators compete with one another at the same airport. This approach is used at a number of airports around the world. EasyJet have raised the issue in the context of Stansted but the commission would be wise to bear it in mind for Heathrow. If this route were chosen, care would be needed to ensure that the airport owner did not find ways to disadvantage the competing terminals in favour of its own operations. Lessons can be learned from experience with airport parking. Those seeking to offer car-parking facilities around BAA airports describe how subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) pressure from the airport operator can make it more difficult to compete with BAA's own facilities.</p> <p>And there is another important area where BAA's monopolistic position has left it slow to react to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/20/britishairways.theairlineindustry\">customer concerns</a>. The company has been very late in engaging with ideas put forward by engineering experts such as Ove Arup &amp; Partners on improving rail connections at Heathrow. <a href=\"http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/columnists/article4406478.ece\">Arup have produced</a> an impressive set of proposals for a northern hub at Heathrow which would connect directly with the main line rail network, linking up with routes to Birmingham (via Reading), Wales, Bristol and the south-west, and also with the Channel Tunnel rail link. </p> <p>Not only would these proposals make it much easier for passengers to get to Heathrow and also reduce surface <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/18/pollution.carbonemissions\">pollution</a> (which is a serious problem in the local area) by getting cars off the road, they would help address capacity pressures at the airport. The Conservative party is looking actively and energetically at how we could make progress towards more high-speed rail in the UK. I firmly believe that high-speed rail could provide a realistic alternative to many of the short-haul flights currently clogging up Heathrow. In so doing, the proposal could do much to improve the passenger experience without the third runway with which BAA and the government are so determined to press forward.</p>",
  "<p><br>Grey area ... Sir Ian McKellen's Gandalf could be the hero of The Hobbit II</p> <p>It's the conundrum faced by every manager at one point or another: do you delegate an important duty to an employee, who may well mess it up, or do you face up to the fact that you'd be far better off just doing it yourself?</p> <p>Two of the greatest film-makers around at the moment, Peter Jackson and Guillermo Del Toro, have been mulling over just that for the past eight months, during their search for a scribe to take on the challenge of translating JRR Tolkien's Lord of the Rings prequel, The Hobbit, into a pair of perfectly-formed screenplays. Their conclusion? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/aug/20/lordoftherings.thehobbit\">The only people they trust to do the job properly are themselves</a>.</p> <p>When the rumours of Del Toro's involvement in The Hobbit began to emerge in January, nobody really thought to ask who would be penning the thing. The Mexican commonly directs from his own screenplay, and Jackson's longstanding creative team of Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, who worked with him on Rings, would presumably be retained. It turns out both these scenarios were by no means a foregone conclusion.</p> <p>The official line behind the decision announced today is that Del Toro and Jackson found themselves so deeply involved in Tolkien's earlier story, which details the adventures of hobbit Bilbo Baggins as he joins Gandalf and a group of dwarves in a quest to slay a dragon, that they simply couldn't bring themselves to farm it out. They also realised that their schedules were less packed than previously thought, and were faced with a tight time period within which to get the films into cinemas.</p> <p>I suspect all of the above are true. But I'm going to speculate that another factor was behind the move. Jackson has promised his newly bosom buddies at New Line not one, but <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/film/2008/02/what_on_middle_earth_will_the.html\">two films based on The Hobbit</a>. And herein lies the issue: there is only one Hobbit book. Tolkien's sequel was The Lord of the Rings: he never saw fit to fill in the 80-year period between the end of the first tome and the start of the second, other than through notes and sections of the appendices to The Lord of the Rings.</p> <p>Del Toro, on the other hand, recently went on record stating that he will only film a second film if there is a second film to film, so to speak. \"We believe there is a second movie,\" <a href=\"http://defamer.com/397317/guillermo-del-toro-would-sooner-burn-down-hollywood-than-make-second-hobbit-film\">he told reporters at the Los Angeles film festival in June</a>. \"If there isn't, there will not be. If we find it, we will shoot it, but by God, if we do not find it, we will not shoot it. I am anxious to shoot the book, and I'm willing and able to dedicate myself to shooting the [second film].\"</p> <p>He's got a point. There are a number of stories which might form the basis of the second film. It could focus on Gandalf's mission to expel Sauron, known in The Hobbit as The Necromancer, from his tower in the evil forest of Mirkwood - Sir Ian McKellen has confirmed he will be involved, and would make a powerful central protagonist. Alternately it could centre on Aragon's years helping the Stewards of Gondor in their battles with the evil Corsairs of Umbar and other dark forces. Perhaps both might be included. Either way, these stories will require significant padding if they are to form the basis of an entire standalone movie. Might there be some dispute between Del Toro and Jackson over whether a second movie is doable? And might Jackson's decision to become closely involved with the screenplay stem from his determination that there will be a second film? It all seems possible.</p> <p>Jackson, after all, has the benefit of his work on Rings to endow him with the confidence that he can do it again, even if this time the task is rather more monumental. He also has the clout: the epic, 1000-page plus Lord of the Rings novel was once thought unfilmable; poor Ralph Bakshi couldn't even get the second part of his drastically cut down version finished before funding was pulled. Jackson managed to get three movies into cinemas which received almost universal acclaim from critics and fans alike and made a staggering <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films\">$2.9bn at the global box office</a>. He's the Tolkien daddy.</p> <p>But that doesn't mean he's going to be able to pull it off. With Rings, filmic conventions meant Jackson and his team were required to trim the story, cut out or combine certain characters and pad out other aspects, such as the love affair between Aragorn and Arwen. They did a remarkable job. With The Hobbit, Jackson (and Del Toro) will be trying to create a film which stands alongside those earlier movies from material as thinly sketched as anything in the history of book to movie adaptations. I wish him the best of luck, and I hope to be proved wrong, but I fear this particular quest will end in failure. Even doing it himself isn't going to get Jackson out of this particular Hobbit hole.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne\">George Osborne</a> today claimed that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordonbrown\">Gordon Brown</a>'s approach to tackling poverty had failed as he sought to present the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives\">Conservatives</a> as the party of fairness.</p> <p>In a much-trailed speech to the centre-left Demos <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/thinktanks\">thinktank</a>, the shadow chancellor claimed that the prime minister was wrong in his assertion that \"only the state can guarantee fairness\".</p> <p>In an interview ahead of his speech, Osborne also said it was his \"overall ambition\" to reduce taxes, but that welfare reform, support for families and increased educational opportunities would be at the heart of a Conservative government.</p> <p>\"What government should be focused on is raising the incomes and the aspirations and the opportunities for the millions of people who are stuck on low incomes, and that is where this government has failed - not because they are bad people, not because they don't have noble ambitions, but because their measure, which is entirely reliant on the state, which is about redistribution, has failed - failed on their own terms,\" Osborne told the BBC. </p> <p>\"Our education system is failing to spread opportunity, our welfare system is keeping people out of work, our tax system makes it extremely difficult for those on low incomes to get off those low incomes because those marginal tax rates are so high. </p> <p>\"Labour has failed, it has created a more unfair society, and I think there is a real opportunity for the Conservative party now to lead this debate.\" </p> <p>Osborne said that \"simply chucking money at people\" was not the answer, but he insisted that the Tories would not scrap the tax credits system. </p> <p>That system would be part of a wider package, he said, adding: \"We will keep tax credits, but we will add to the battle on poverty other things, like welfare reform, like extending educational opportunity, like supporting families, and these Conservative methods of achieving progressive goals are likely to be far more successful and create a fairer society.\" </p> <p>Osborne said it was \"obviously\" his ambition to reduce taxes, but only when the country could afford it. \"At the moment borrowing is rising, and that's a real issue.\"</p> <p>In his speech Osborne identified three key characteristics of a fair society: properly rewarding people for their effort and ability, equality of opportunity, and not saddling future generations with the costs of current mistakes. He claimed that the right was winning the argument in all three policy areas.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/nickclegg\">Nick Clegg</a>, the leader of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/liberaldemocrats\">Liberal Democrats</a>, said: \"George Osborne's restaurant has a menu without prices. There is something for everyone, but no one has to pay.\" </p> <p>He added: \"What passes for Conservative policy is nothing but a series of hopelessly vague ambitions. </p> <p>\"They would rather repeatedly tell us that we are broken than say what they would do to fix things. The only genuine policy they have is a tax break for the richest 6% of people.\" </p> <p>Clegg said that in order to create a fairer society, there should be tax cuts for people on low and middle incomes. </p> <p>High earners and those who damage the environment ought to pay more, he said. </p> <p>\"It's time for the Conservatives to realise that power must be earned, not inherited and to start setting out some serious policies.\"</p> <p>Angela Eagle, the Treasury minister, said: \"If this is the best the Tories can do to claim they are a party of fairness, then the Labour party is delighted that the battle will be joined on this issue. </p> <p>\"George Osborne's speech shows we are fighting a Tory party that, for all the talk of change, is still committed to the old unfair policies.\" </p> <p>She added: \"George Osborne offers empty rhetoric on child poverty now, but people will remember that this is the same shadow chancellor whose flagship tax policy diverts \u00a31bn to the 3,000 richest estates in the country. </p> <p>\"And this is the same Tory party that opposed the minimum wage, opposed pension credit and the winter fuel allowance, opposed support for families through tax credits and still won't commit to any real pledge on child poverty.\"</p>",
  "<p>Britain could be heading for it wettest August for a century as forecasters predicted more heavy rain tomorrow, but held out the hope of a drier bank holiday.</p> <p>Homes were flooded and cricket and horse racing events cancelled today as heavy rain lashed the country, causing rivers to burst their banks.</p> <p>The Met Office this afternoon issued severe weather warnings, predicting up to 50mm of rain tomorrow in the north-west of England, Yorkshire and the Humber, the East Midlands and Scotland. Warnings were already in place for today in south and central Wales and central Scotland.</p> <p>Across Britain, 95.5mm of rain has fallen so far this month, as of last Sunday. It may seem a long way off the wettest ever \u2013 when 166.3mm fell in August 1917 \u2013 but there has already been a considerable amount of rain since then.

  "<p>Japan is to carry carbon footprint labels on food packaging and other products in an ambitious scheme to persuade companies and consumers to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>The labels, to appear on dozens of items including food and drink, detergents and electrical appliances from next spring, will go further than similar labels already in use elsewhere.</p> <p>They will provide detailed breakdowns of each product's carbon footprint under a government-approved calculation and labeling system now being discussed by the trade ministry and around 30 firms.</p> <p>The labels will show how much carbon dioxide is emitted during the manufacture, distribution and disposal of each product, the ministry said.<br>The Japanese campaign is loosely modeled on a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/apr/16/carbonfootprints.tesco\">British pilot scheme</a> involving Tesco and several other firms, though that scheme has yet to gain official approval.</p> <p>Furthermore, the trade ministry's Takuma Inamura told the Guardian: \"We believe our labeling will be even more detailed, to allow consumers to make the best possible choice.\"</p> <p>Officials decided to draw up a uniform method of labeling carbon emissions to allay fears among some firms that their competitors may use in-house calculations to produce the lowest possible emissions data.</p> <p>\"Unless all of the companies use the same method, there's little point to the exercise,\" Inamura said.</p> <p>To promote the scheme, the ministry has released details of the carbon footprint left by a packet of crisps. A single bag emits 75 grams of carbon dioxide, 44% of which comes from growing potatoes, with another 30% emitted during the production stage. The packaging accounts for a further 15%, while the delivery and disposal of the bag account for 9% and 2%, respectively.</p> <p>About 30 companies will display their labeled items at an eco-products fair in Tokyo in December, and the first batches are expected to appear in shops at the beginning of April 2009.</p> <p>Sapporo, a leading Japanese brewery, has already said it will carry the labels on cans of its popular Black Label beer. Shoppers will be told how much CO2 is emitted by the machinery used to plant barley and hops, during production and transportation, and when the empty can is recycled.</p> <p>Although the labeling scheme is voluntary, few firms want to be seen to be lagging behind rivals in the rush to corner the growing market in eco-friendly products. The supermarket firm Aeon, as well as the convenience store chains Lawson and Seven-Eleven and the electronics maker Matsushita are among the firms taking part.</p> <p>As host of the groundbreaking Kyoto conference on greenhouse gas emissions in 1997, Japan is under mounting pressure to use it technological prowess and educated consumer base to promote a low-carbon society. But it has so far struggled to reach its Kyoto protocol commitment to slash CO2 emissions by 6% below 1990 levels by 2012.</p> <p>In July, the government vowed to reduce total carbon emissions by up to 80% by 2050 with the prime minister, Yasuo Fukuda, calling on consumers to lead a global \"CO2 reduction revolution\".</p> <p>Under <a href=\"http://www.weforum.org/en/media/Latest%20Press%20Releases/PR_26jan_Japan\">Fukuda's Cool Earth Initiative</a>, Japan believes it can lower emissions from current levels by 14% by 2020, although UN scientists say cuts as high as 40% will be needed to avoid environmental catastrophe.</p> <p>Later this year Japanese firms will experiment with a carbon trading system modeled on the one used by the European Union. The government plans to put carbon-capture technology - the storage of CO2 emitted by power plants and factories - in place by 2020.</p> <p>But it remains to be seen whether consumers can be persuaded to consider a product's carbon footprint as well as its price tag. In a recent survey almost 80% of shoppers said they would be willing to spend no more than an extra 2,000 yen (\u00a310) a month on energy-saving vehicles and other eco-friendly products.</p> <p>\"Most people don't know what the term carbon footprint really means,\" Inamura said. \"But we hope this will be a launch pad for other companies to take part and increase public awareness.\"</p> <p>\u00b7 This article was amended on Thursday August 21 2008.

Google's money will be used specifically to develop enhanced geothermal systems (EGS). </p> <p>Traditional geothermal technology harnesses naturally-occurring pockets of steam or hot water that rise from deep underground, bringing with them the energy stored by the rocks there. EGS allows those traditional techniques to be applied almost anywhere. By drilling deep into the Earth and pumping water into the hole, the underground hot rocks fracture, allowing the water to circulate and be heated. The hot water comes back the surface and is then used to drive turbines and produce electricity (watch <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6r_3AgI49Y\">EGS explainer video</a>).</p> <p>\"EGS could be the killer app of the energy world,\" said Dan Reicher, director of climate and energy initiatives for Google.org. \"One of the attractive aspects is that it's baseload, it's 24-hour power and that's a nice complement to solar and wind, which are intermittent sources. </p> <p>\"If you can put all three of these technologies together, we're going to have a much more attractive green electricity mix.\"</p> <p>A recent report by the <a href=\"http://www1.eere.energy.gov/geothermal/future_geothermal.html\">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> estimated that tapping just 2% of the EGS resource between 3km and 10km below the surface of the continental USA could supply more than 2,500 times the country's total annual energy use. Around the world, geothermal projects in countries from Australia to Iceland and Germany already generate thousands of megawatts of electricity. </p> <p>The Australian government announced on Wednesday that it would invest A$50m (\u00a323.4m) in developing ways to convert geothermal energy into baseload electricity. Experts there believe that tapping just 1% of the potential geothermal energy in the country could provide 26,000 years of energy supplies.</p> <p><strong>Funding</strong></p> <p>Google.org's funding will provide cash for three projects in the US. The first is $6.25m for <a href=\"http://www.altarockenergy.com/\">AltaRock Energy</a>, a company based in Sausalito, California, that is researching ways to improve the efficiency of EGS projects. <a href=\"http://www.potterdrilling.com/\">Potter Drilling</a> of Redwood City, California, will receive $4m to develop ways to make drilling deep holes in hard rock less expensive. And the Southern Methodist university's <a href=\"http://www.smu.edu/geothermal/\">geothermal laboratory</a>, based in Dallas, Texas, will receive almost $500,000 to produce updated geothermal maps of North America. </p> <p>Larry Brilliant, executive director of Google.org, said that innovation would be the \"path to massive quantities of cleaner, cheaper energy. The people we're funding today have a real shot at lowering the cost of EGS, and bringing us closer to our goal.\"</p> <p>The investment is part of Google.org's Renewable Energy Cheaper than Coal initiative, which is primarily focusing on solar thermal power, wind and EGS. The organisation has set itself a goal to produce one gigawatt of renewable energy capacity, enough to power a city the size of San Francisco, within a few years.</p> <p>\"EGS is critical to the clean electricity revolution we need to solve the climate crisis, but EGS hasn't received the attention it merits. That's why we're pressing for expanded support from government and increased investment from the private sector,\" said Reicher. </p> <p>He criticised the US government for ignoring the EGS potential on its doorstep. \"We have a new president and congress starting in November and we're optimistic that whoever is elected president is going to seize the opportunity here and we expect support.\"</p> <p>Mike Crocker, a spokesperson for Greenpeace USA, said geothermal energy was one of several renewable sources that could help the US wean itself from fossil fuels. \"Geothermal power plants produce electricity about 90% of the time, compared to 65%-75% for fossil-fuel power plants and causes virtually no greenhouse gas emissions. Today, it is technically feasible to access enough geothermal power to meet all the world's energy demands.\" </p> <p>He added: \"While Google is investing in 21st century energy solutions, Congress continues to be hung up on 19th century technologies like oil and coal.\" </p> <p>Reicher noted that, though the cost of generating electricity from EGS today sits somewhere between solar photovoltaics at the high end and normal coal-fired power at the low end, the costs could be quickly brought down.</p>",
  "<p>British manufacturers are preparing to cut output at the fastest rate in nearly seven years as the global economic downturn makes trading increasingly difficult for UK exporters, a CBI survey showed today.</p> <p>But while output weakens, price pressures are still strong in the sector despite falling oil prices. This is likely to reinforce concerns among policymakers at the Bank of England over the strength of the UK economy.</p> <p>The latest industrial trends survey showed output expectations for the next three months are at their weakest since December 2001. However, the balance of firms expecting the price of manufactured goods to rise has barely changed since last month's 18-year high.</p> <p>The survey echoes official data earlier this month which showed the rise in prices of goods <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/11/inflation.interestrates\">leaving the factory gate</a> jumped to a higher-than-expected 10.2% on the year to July - the sharpest annual rise since the series began in 1986.</p> <p>\"Cost pressures from food and other commodities are clearly still having an impact, despite recent falls in the price of oil,\" Ian McCafferty, the CBI's chief economic adviser said.</p> <p>This comes as a blow to the Bank's monetary policy committee, which hoped that the recent slight in oil from its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jul/11/oil.commodities\">record peak</a> in July would help bring down inflation pressures in the economy. </p> <p>Both the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/20/interestrates.bankofenglandgovernor\">Bank minutes</a> published today and its quarterly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/13/inflation.interestrates\">inflation report</a> last week stated that inflation should fall back towards the official 2% target by 2009 leaving the door open for a cut in interest rates perhaps as early as the year end.</p> <p>Lower borrowing costs would help firms revive their business, and give the flagging economy a boost. The CBI survey showed that there was a drop in firms' orders for a second month running in August and by slightly more than expected.</p> <p>Manufacturers are getting little support from their usual markets in the eurozone after figures recently showed the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/14/europe.economicgrowth\">first contraction</a> in growth since the monetary union was formed a decade ago.</p> <p>\"Domestic conditions remain sluggish and the recent slowdown in the eurozone economies is starting to make conditions tougher for UK manufacturing exporters although the weaker pound will offer some relief,\" said McCafferty.</p> <p>The most recent CBI economic forecast, published in June, predicted that UK growth would slow from 1.7% this year to 1.3% in 2009. The Bank of England have not ruled out the possibility of negative growth by the year end - two successive quarters of this and the UK would officially be in a recession.</p>",
  "<p><br>Be scared. Be very scared ... Surallun gives the finger to the Dragons' Den team. Photograph: Rolf Marriott/BBC</p> <p>Previously thought to be solitary beasts, it is becoming increasingly clear that Dragons hunt in pairs. First, Peter Jones criticised rival programme The Apprentice for being unrealistic and now <a href=\"http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/realitytv/a124058/paphitis-slams-bbc-rival-the-apprentice.html\">Theo Paphitis</a> has joined in the dissing. Showing the shrewdness that has made him La Senza's bra and panties saviour, Paphitis notes how contestants \"all live in a house together and are given tasks\", like Big Brother. It would be churlish to point out that Dragons' Dens is just X Factor for entrepreneurs but, well, Dragons' Dens is just X Factor for entrepreneurs so maybe Theo needs to keep his pie hostel shut?</p> <p>Though we may be waiting for a withering response from Surallun, It seems that the two shows might be squaring up. Which means a definitive comparison is in order. Let us see how Dragons' Den and The Apprentice match up in key reality TV categories. It's a bit like a job interview... FROM HELL.</p> <p>Drama The Apprentice boardroom is always memorable. Think of it as It's a Wonderful Life in reverse: by means of appraising your existence, you are shown all the horrible, useless things you've done and how everyone would be better off if you were never born. But the Den devilishly combines the naked terror of the hopefuls fronting their pitch with the secondary level of backbiting between the Dragons as they seek to secure outbid or out-wisecrack each other. <strong>Victor:</strong> Dragons' Den.</p> <p>Comedy Could anything be funnier than the foreign driving glove or the coffee table media centre the Dragons guffawed at? Why, yes - <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4mkEjdj4Kw\">Simon's trampette assembly turmoil</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZTqD-lew3Q\">Nargis's six-million-ways-to-die cat calendar pitch</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU_QMq0YHjk\">Tre vs Rory showdown</a>. Score one for Nick and Margaret. <strong>Victor:</strong> The Apprentice.</p> <p>Supporting cast Evan Davis in the Dragons' corner is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DikUNwTdT8k\">affable</a> but does seem to delight in stating the obvious. Adrian Chiles, on the other hand, fronts one of the best ancillary shows around in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3EA5jVoAPI\">You're Fired</a>. <strong>Victor:</strong> The Apprentice.</p> <p>The fear factor No one can badger, bully and humiliate like Surallun. His boardroom beatdowns have caused more children's nightmares than the Dark Knight and should be strictly X-rated. But in the Den, the sheer aggregate weight of contempt from Duncan Bannatyne and Deborah Meaden makes you feel like God himself is passing judgment. <strong>Victor:</strong> Dragons' Den. This is going to a tense tie-break.</p> <p>Real-life business relevance Yes, The Apprentice showcases some of the worst business decisions ever made but at least half these people were able to hold their own impressive jobs (well, Global Pricing Leader sounds impressive at least). Chumps in the Dragons' Den, meanwhile, consistently forget the oft-repeated holy trinity of turnover, gross profit and net profit. This would never happen on The Apprentice where hopefuls <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G256H_Q0bI&amp;feature=related\">just forget what race they are</a>. <strong>Victor:</strong> The Apprentice.</p> <p>This crucial victory means Surallun and co still preside over the classiest reality TV show on the box.</p> <p>But who gets your nod? Is the corporate porn of The Apprentice what gets you off or do the Dragons' Den money shots hit the spot? Is Theo Paphitis right to compare The Apprentice to Big Brother, or is he just a maniac obsessed with his children's inheritance?</p>",
  "<p>The difficulty with droughts is that they can turn to floods overnight. The difficulty with rain, or acute lack of it, when tied into the prophesies of global warming, is that the short-term can turn from arid to soggy in a trice. Which is part, but not all, of the Spanish story.</p> <p>Remember Britain in the summer of 2006? It was hot and dry, after a dry winter and dry spring \u2013 and the water began to run out. The spectre of standpipes stalked the streets of the south again. Thames Water, as usual, took a mighty leakage drubbing: and we were copiously advised that there would be worse to come as climates inexorably changed. But then 2007 was a sodden ordeal and the aquifers filled up again. Now, in 2008, we're wailing about the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/aug/12/weather.flooding?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=networkfront\">lousiest August</a> any of us can remember.</p> <p>Now turn to <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/spains-drought-a-glimpse-of-our-future-833587.html\">Catalonia this spring</a>. There'd been precious little snow on the Pyrenees, so rivers like the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ter_River\">Ter</a> were low. When I went to see my Spanish grandchildren near La Bisbal, the river bed was absolutely dry. In Barcelona the mayor was signalling water rationing and calling for tankers to bring relief into port. It couldn't have looked more threatening. And then it rained.</p> <p>Now the apples are ripening in the <a href=\"http://www.barcelona.com/barcelona_city_guide/catalonia/costa_brava/baix_emporda/\">Baix Emporda</a> and the yellow fields of sunflowers stretch endlessly. The Ter is half full, the land is surprisingly green, the champion golf courses lush and tended. All it takes is a couple of weeks of downpours to move us from crisis to complacency. But complacency, here, is a fatal state of mind.</p> <p>Catalonia, with its high plateaux and mountain ranges, ought to be one of the wetter regions of Spain (as well as the richest). Andalucia ought to be one of the driest, most over-populated and over-farmed regions: and is. Andalucia is concrete and tourists and fruit and poverty. It has plunged, often heedlessly, into acute water shortage. But when water and regionalism and politics mix, everything grows toxic. Now Catalonia, which might have helped send water to the arid south, knows it has problems of its own. The rest of Spain, some of it wet like Galicia, some of it desert like the area just north of Almeria, knows that water is a most vital resource. Watch that factor into the separatist pressures in Catalonia, the Basque country and (more mildly) in Galicia. Watch water put more acute strain on the Spanish state.</p> <p>In Britain, we said two years ago, there should be a national grid, moving water from the wet north-west to the dry south-east. But that is damnable expensive, slow to build \u2013 and easy to deride if you're laying it whilst the rain pours down. (Cue Daily Mail editorial). And Spain is in much the same sort of bind \u2013 with Basque and Catalan nationalism dropped in the mix. (It's Scotland's oil and the Basque country's water!). </p> <p>We should be clear that whole areas of Europe are becoming fatally dry. We should set about either limiting water use or transporting water in from wetter areas. We should be constructing the infrastructure that can cope with crisis. But then it starts raining again: then the flood alerts start, then long-term trends turn into a heavy shower, and we forget (as Catalonia has forgotten once more this summer). But at least the Spanish have water meters as standard. At least they have some control when the skies are incessantly blue. In Britain, we haven't even got that far yet. In Britain, the arguments about climate change and threat fade fast before a looming recession; and we still don't realise that life \u2013 everything that is precious \u2013 begins and ends with the need for water.</p>",
  "<p>The EU is in as much disarray about how to handle the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economicgrowth\">looming recession</a> as it is over how to confront Russia's belligerence in the Caucasus. \"<em>Toutes</em> <em>directions</em>,\" the often confusing signpost at crossroads in French provincial towns, just about sums up eurozone government responses so far.</p> <p>France, which holds the EU presidency, is effectively pushing for a concerted series of activist, counter-cyclical measures to be adopted when</p> <p>finance ministers meet in Nice in the middle of next month - even if it means busting the bloc's 3% budget deficit limit.</p> <p>It can count on support from its \"Club Med\" partners in Italy and Spain but Germany, determined to maintain fiscal discipline and avoid a repeat of the 1970s, is resolutely opposed. And so is the European commission.</p> <p>Like his Spanish counterpart, Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, last week, Francois Fillon, the French premier, cut short his holiday this week and</p> <p>summoned his economic ministers to discuss national measures to improve the \"<em>pouvoir d'achat</em>\" or purchasing power of his disgruntled fellow citizens.</p> <p>Fillon insists there's no question of adopting measures to boost the economy but the alarm bells are ringing in Berlin and Brussels.</p> <p>The French economy contracted 0.3% in the second quarter while eurozone GDP fell 0.2% after rising 0.7% in the first quarter.</p> <p>Fillon says there's no question of a recession in France, with his government sticking to its 1.7% growth target but the Bank of France says it will be lucky to achieve 1%.</p> <p>Spain saw its once rampant economy slow to 0.1% growth in the second quarter while Italy's contracted 0.3%. The key German economy, which grew by an extraordinary 1.3% in the first quarter, drooped by 0.5% in the second.</p> <p>The German outlook is, by itself, pretty confusing. This week the ZEW institute reported a recovery in investor confidence after this hit a 16-<br>year low last month but this is more about expectations. </p> <p>As RBS economists pointed out, the ZEW index for current conditions posted a 17-year record fall, pointing to how badly the German economy is suffering - not as bad as the slump of 2001-05 but bad enough. </p> <p>Even so, the government still expects around 1.7% growth this year - and another economic institute, Berlin-based DIW, still expects it to top 2% for the year despite forecasting just 0.1% growth in the current quarter.</p> <p>There's now a sense that the worst may be over and recession averted. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/oil\">fall in oil prices</a>, reflected in the cost of petrol at the pump,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/currencies\"> the relative decline of the euro against the dollar</a>, less pressure on food prices - and, the French government hopes, no prospect of a further rise in interest rates after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/europe\">the European Central Bank hike to 4.25% in July</a>.</p> <p>These all have been seized as signs that inflation may have peaked at 4% in June/July. But the situation is labile - as are the responses of eurozone policy-makers. But there's definitely one thing which unites them and commentators. </p> <p>It's the decline of the once-model UK economy and its obvious stagnation after 15 years of continuous growth. After years of lectures from Gordon Brown, the whiff of Schadenfreude is unavoidable - and widespread.</p> <p><strong>Champions league</strong></p> <p>But at least the Brits - and Irish and the Nordics- have a record, however poor, in building new global champions over the past quarter of a century or so. Germany, France and the rest of the \"Club Med\" - Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece - have between them created none in the period 1976 to 2000.</p> <p>This emerges from a recent study by Nicolas V\u00e9ron of the Brussels-based Bruegel Institute: The Demographics of Global Corporate Champions. This examines and dates the origins of the world's 500 largest companies as of September 30 last year and it confirms the worst fears among policymakers: Europe (and Japan) is being left behind by the US and the emerging economies and is far from achieving its target of becoming the world's leading knowledge-based and innovative economy.</p> <p>V\u00e9ron's analysis finds that a third of US \"champions\" were born after 1945 and, of these, 25 or 14% came to life in the last quarter of the 20th century. By contrast, 78% of Europe's champions in the sample date from before 1914 and 90% before 1939. Only a dozen were born after 1945 and only three since 1976 - BSkyB, Vodafone and Renewable Energy Corporation of Norway.</p> <p>Emerging economies, however, can boast a quarter of their global champions as being young - and more than a half born in the second half of the 20th century. That finding may not be astonishing but it's the comparison with the US which continues to be distressing. </p> <p>The Americans are strong innovators in creating hi-tech and services champions. V\u00e9ron suggests that EU policy-makers should focus on measures to enable the emergence of innovation \"ecosystems\" and on unleashing the growth potential of services sectors. It may be a reprise of previous conclusions but well worth repeating.</p> <p><strong>Germany plays catch-up </strong></p> <p>Well, at least these economic and corporate shortcomings are not preventing the heads of existing champions from increasing their own net worth. In Britain the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/executivesalaries\">average salary increase for FTSE 100 execs</a> was 8.1% last year but their German counterparts netted rises of 10.5%. </p> <p>Incomes Data Services, in a study released earlier this month when Europe's banks were piling on the credit crunch agony, found that the average salary for Germany's top execs is \u00a3505,997 against \u00a3737,537 in the UK. Total cash remuneration for the Germans, including bonuses and benefits, rose just under 20% against a \"mere\" 16% in Britain.</p> <p>Adam Elston of IDS says Germany is simply responding to the most serious brain drain since the 1940s as executives quit for the US and UK. \"European firms now benchmark pay against international peer groups in their own industries rather than against domestic rivals.\" Pity they can't compete in creating new opportunities for all.</p>",
  "<p><br>A more obvious odyssey ... Dylan and Kylie in Lance Daly's Kisses A bright yellow van wends its way through the greenery of a Welsh country back road. This is the mobile library that John Jones brings once a month to the folk of Trefeurig, a village still clinging to the 20th century. The seasonal rites of local farming and community life - calving, f\u00eates, church services, livestock auctions, stuffing your pet owl - unfold at their own pace, but for all the newborn piglets and lambs, there are no young adults in evidence, and the village school is closing down. The yellow library is a symbol of defiance, of autonomy, but it is a token of change, too. \"Do you have an idiot's guide to computers?\", the owl lady wonders. </p> <p>Sleep Furiously, Gideon Koppel's bittersweet portrait of his parents' village, was one of a number of films playing at the Locarno Film Festival that had me thinking about cinema, place and narrative journey. In Koppel's film, that slow yellow streak of Jones' van is the only onscreen hint of a voyage; the greater waves of change crash down off screen. (The film's title, incidentally, refers to Noam Chomsky's famous instance of a sentence that is both grammatically correct and nonsensical: \"Colourless green ideas sleep furiously\"; the film shows how in Trefeurig, a likely neighbour of Dylan Thomas's sleepy village of Llareggub, there is tumult in trying to stand still.) The film is scheduled for a release in spring 2009.</p> <p>A more obvious odyssey was that undertaken by two Irish pre-teens, Dylan and Kylie, who escape the abuses of their Dublin shantytown homes and hitch to the big city in Lance Daly's Kisses. By design a love story, the film was a skilful if uneasy blend of realism and fairy tale, highlighted by the Wizard of Oz-like blossoming from black and white to colour as the kids set out on their yellow brick road. Bob Dylan was the presiding spirit here, for no convincing reason, and the filmmakers had such a facility for pretty montages that they employed half a dozen. It looked a likely hit.</p> <p>The British director Ben Hopkins (Simon Magus, The Nine Lives of Tomas Katz, Footprints) hit the road after too many struggles with native film funding and wound up making snapshots of globalisation in Turkey. The Market - A Tale of Trade, which won Locarno's Best Actor prize for Sereban Aslan, follows a small-time trader to Azerbaijan and back as he tries to hustle his way up the commercial ladder, using a commission for local medicine as his seed capital, without (entirely) sacrificing his ethics or independence. Poker skills are essential. Guilt, shame, bankruptcy and the mafia hover like vultures - and this is the free-market web that will bind us all, the film suggests - but Hopkins paints the upshot in shades of grey and brown, not black. \"The world turns, we all become dogs in the end,\" his Greek (Turkish?) chorus sings.</p> <p>Digging in for the status quo were the victors of the global market - the idle super-rich - in Josu\u00e9 Mendez's ferocious debut feature Dioses (Gods). This poison-pen letter to Peru's upper class was a kind of social horror movie, centred on the sybaritic, emotionally stultified family of a captain of industry - his nihilistic party-girl daughter, a son pent up with incestuous frustration, and a young new trophy wife desperate to hide her lower-class origins.</p> <p>Like Sleep Furiously, the film mostly cut across potential narrative change to show a culture fixed in its ways, though here those ways are unnatural, unjust and immiserating. (The implied fate of the Peruvian elite's womenfolk was a particularly chilling off-screen yarn.) Tar black, the film ended on a scene out of Brave New World. If they can sneak it through customs, this hand grenade of a movie should make a hit at plenty more festivals and beyond.</p>",

  "<p>NBC Universal has made its first move into UK independent production by snapping up Carnival, the company behind Harley Street and Hotel Babylon, for up to \u00a330m. </p> <p>The acquisition is part of a new strategy by the US network and Hollywood studio business to move into production outside America.</p> <p>Under the agreement, NBC will take 100% control of Carnival and merge it into its international TV production division, headed by president Angela Bromstad. </p> <p>The deal covers Carnival's back catalogue, which includes ITV dramas including Poirot, Jeeves and Wooster and Rosemary and Thyme. </p> <p>Carnival is currently owned by Australian company Southern Star and the company's chief executive officer, Gareth Neame, who joined Carnival from the BBC in 2004.</p> <p>NBC Universal said Southern Star's 75% stake, together with its library of Carnival programming, was worth between \u00a320m and \u00a322m, although it would not comment on the full cost of the deal. Industry estimates have put it at up to \u00a330m. </p> <p>NBC Universal is one of the biggest US media and entertainment companies, operating channels including the NBC broadcast network and cable services such as USA, Bravo, Sci-Fi and Oxygen.</p> <p>The company also owns the Universal Hollywood film studio and a TV production operation that makes shows including House, Battlestar Galatica, Law &amp; Order and NBC's US version of The Office.</p> <p>There has been speculation for some time that Carnival was up for sale, with BBC Worldwide and ITV thought to be interested.</p> <p>Neame said: \"I am excited to bring the company into the global brand that is NBC Universal under this groundbreaking deal, which offers great strategic opportunities for Carnival and all the talent who work with us. </p> <p>\"As a unique production model in the UK, I believe we will have so much to bring to our broadcaster relationships and the creative community. Equally, as a production base for NBC Universal outside of north America, we will be an important asset for our new parent.\"</p> <p>NBC Universal's move into the UK production market is likely to raise eyebrows at the BBC and ITV - both of which have been keen to snap up stakes in independent producers themselves. </p> <p>The US giant has already made forays into the UK, with the purchase of Hallmark Channel owner Sparrowhawk Media.</p> <p>NBC Universal wants to more than double non-US revenue by 2010 and its international acquisitions include a 26% share of NDTV Networks in India. </p> <p>Jeff Zucker, the president and chief executive of NBC Universal, said: \"International growth is one of our key strategic priorities, and that includes boosting our ability to create programming for specific local audiences around the world. This acquisition will jump-start our efforts in the very important UK market.\"</p> <p>Carnival will be managed by Bromstad in London. She said: \"Carnival is a highly respected TV production operation and we are delighted to welcome them into the NBC Universal fold.\"</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p>In late 1986, a beach party celebrating the summer solstice marked the first official <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_Man\">Burning Man</a>. Within a few years, its participants had become so many, and its activities so outlandish, that founder Larry Harvey and his friends decided to move the festival to somewhere more appropriate. They chose the Black Rock desert, a 100-mile prehistoric lakebed in north-western Nevada, where temperatures regularly reach 110\u00b0F.</p> <p>By 1997, Burning Man was already well on the way to becoming a cultural phenomenon. That year 10,000 people turned up to experience a week of desert living, far outside the mainstream culture of the United States. Within \"Black Rock City\", participants abide by a gift economy, in which commerce of any type is expressly forbidden. \"Burners\" must bring all their own food, camping equipment and water; and are expected to \"participate\" in one form or another. Many choose to construct extraordinary temporal pieces of art: full size buildings made of driftwood and junk, flashing sculptures belching flames into the night. Walking around the desert after dark, this formerly empty expanse shimmers with a thousand projections and creations, impromptu performances, DJ booths, fantastical art cars resembling pirate ships and dragonflies. \"It's like stepping through the looking glass,\" one Burner told me. \"The default world \u2013 which is what we call the world outside \u2013 just can't compare with this.\"</p> <p>In 2007, numbers at Burning Man reached 35,000. There were people of every age group, from every stratum of society. I was among them, knowing no one, expecting little more than a fun week in a somewhat surreal environment. And yet, like thousands before me, the week was transformative, life changing, instantly addictive. This third largest city in Nevada (vanishing \"without a trace\" after the festival') was spotlessly clean, full of highly creative and considerate individuals. People travelled everywhere by bicycle, some of them naked. Everywhere I went, people offered me food, free rides on their \"mutant vehicles\", invitations to all-night parties, yoga lessons, fire juggling demonstrations. Dressed in bizarre costumes, wearing sand goggles and dust masks, it seemed easy to take people at face value, little caring what they did outside Black Rock. The annual theme, which last year was entitled Green Man, seemed to perfectly mesh with the zeitgeist. Invention and great creativity was needed to rethink the carbon-based structure of our world. At Burning Man that world seemed to rise up in the present moment, ecologically sound and full of laughter. </p> <p>It would be all to easy to write off Burning Man as a desert rave, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/14/arts/design/14burn.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1\">an escape valve for overstressed executives</a>, a 21st-century <a href=\"http://www.mcsweeneys.net/2004/9/14robillard.html\">update on Woodstock</a>. But more than any of those things, Burning Man is a <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2003/08/60159\">philosophy</a>, an attempt to reinvent the parameters and constraints of society. Within the most advanced capitalist economy in the world, participants choose to free themselves from commerce. Art works are anonymous, often destroyed at the end of the week, even in the case of colossal structures taking months to build. People make an effort to help each other \u2013 a necessary step, actually, given the potentially hostile natural environment. Unlike any other festival I've visited, it's one without celebrity, corporate logos, or personal egos of any kind. </p> <p>\"Given the current cultural and political climate in the United States,\" Geoffrey told me, a veteran Burner of seven years, \"this is really the only sane place left. I've been incredibly broke this year and wasn't sure I was going to make it, but then I realised that I had to be here, it's the only truly sacred experience open to me right now.\"</p> <p>Perhaps more even than the enlightening effects of doing without money, running water or cell phone connection, Burning Man seems to effect a spiritual magnetism on those who attend. From above, the circular design of the city, carefully zoned each year, seems akin to some ancient pagan site. With its fire worship, close connection to nature, and emphasis on participation, Burning Man offers a transcendent experience to all comers. Each year, a Temple of Forgiveness invites people to inscribe the names of loved ones who have passed away on its walls and ceilings, before the whole structure goes up in flames, in a grand gesture of emancipation. A central tent hosts Wiccan dances, group zazen, chanting and tribal drum circles, invoking a spiritual dimension without dogma or belief.</p> <p>For myself, as I rode my bicycle far out on to the prehistoric lakebed at midnight, looking backwards on the glittering utopia that is Black Rock City, Burning Man seemed like the freest place on earth. Behind me, people from all over the world were gathered in what felt like some kind of non denominational worship. I wasn't exactly sure what we were worshipping, but it felt significant. Significant enough that back in the 'default' world, my first act was to book my ticket for 2008.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Burning Man Project: August 25-September 1 2008-08 ( tickets must be bought beforehand, they're not sold on the gate), <a href=\"http://www.burningman.com\">burningman.com</a> </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Getting there: <a href=\"http://www.ba.com\">British Airways</a>flies to Reno via Dallas or Chicago (with onward flights on American Airlines) from \u00a3549.20. Black Rock is more than 100 miles north of Reno, and gives a new meaning to the term \"middle of nowhere\". It takes roughly three hours by car, and you should be prepared to share the road with livestock and wildlife.</p>",

  "<p>With Christine Ohuruogu overturning a lifetime Olympic ban to win gold in Beijing and John Terry recovering from his Moscow penalty miss to win the England captaincy, it seems that today's papers are filled with heart-warming redemption.</p> <p>Take <strong>Mika\u00ebl Silvestre</strong>, for instance. It appears that the out-of-favour <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/aug/20/arsenal.manchesterunited\">Manchester United defender is bound for Arsenal</a> in one of the most bizarre swoops seen since Vanilla Ice made a girl fall off a horse by jumping at her <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5z1xqLPcE0c&amp;feature=related\">with his motorbike</a>. Roy Keane had been hoping to re-unite with his former team-mate, but will instead make do with signing <strong>David Healy</strong> from Fulham and <strong>Anton Ferdinand</strong> from West Ham.</p> <p>Such a daring move, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's that is, not Ice's, will almost certainly please Gunners fans, as Le Professeur has been insisting for the last few weeks that he has only been looking for a midfielder, despite all the evidence pointing a glaring need to plug the gaping hole in the Arsenal's dodgy defence. Like Ohuruogu and Terry before him, Silvestre, has thus been afforded another truly moving shot at the big time.</p> <p>And moving shots remind the Mill of two things. Deco's goal for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/aug/18/premierleague1\">Chelsea on Sunday</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TjyR_3mUsM\">last scene</a> of the Shawshank Redemption, when Morgan Freeman's character meets up with that of Tim Robbins's on the sun-soaked sands of Zihuatanejo, Mexico. Freeman was nominated for an Oscar in that film and Tony Mowbray is looking to land one of his own by beating Newcastle to 20-year-old Argentinian forward <strong>Oscar Trejo</strong> of Real Mallorca. Mowbray has already returned from the Spanish holiday island with a nice sun-tan, a bottle of Sangria, a \u00a34.9m hole in his pocket and <strong>23-year-old midfielder Borja Valero</strong>.</p> <p>Spain, then, is clearly not a popular destination for footballers this week as Paul Ince is hoping to persuade Jordi L\u00f3pez to leave Mallorca for the tropical climes of Lancashire, while <strong>Tottenham plan to replace the outgoing Dimitar Berbatov with Diego Forlan of Atl\u00e9tico Madrid</strong>. Once Berba's off, <strong>Hull reckon they can bring Fraizer Campbell back from United for \u00a35m</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Espanyol's Albert Riera</strong>, meanwhile, could be latest addition to Liverpool's expanding Spanish community as Rafa Ben\u00edtez concedes defeat in his bid to sign Gareth Barry, although word has it that <strong>Stewart Downing</strong> is having Spanish lessons ahead of a possible move to Anfield.</p> <p>Elsewhere, West Ham have gone to extreme lengths to boost their firepower by deciding to buy a tank. Chilean forward <strong>Sebastian Pinto</strong> is thus nicknamed and poised to join Upton Park on a season-long deal, and in what could be yet another emotional sporting return to greatness (or not) La Gazzetta Dello Sport reports that Milan have agreed a deal to take <strong>Andriy Shevchenko</strong> back to the San Siro on loan from Chelsea \u2013 a sweetener which has nothing whatsoever to do with Chelsea's sustained attempt to land the \u00a370m-rated Kak\u00e1.</p>",
  "<p>Scotland's first minister, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/alexsalmond\">Alex Salmond</a>, has unveiled a series of measures to bolster the Scottish economy against the current global economic crisis, including the release of up to \u00a3100m for affordable housing. </p> <p>Delivering the annual Donald Dewar lecture at the Edinburgh International Book Festival, Salmond, said that in spite of the political constraints of devolution, there was much that the Scottish government could do to help the Scottish economy cope and ease pressure on households and businesses. </p> <p>A few hours earlier, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/snp\">SNP</a> leader announced that \u00a3100m of cash was to be made available ahead of schedule to help deliver affordable housing. The money, originally earmarked for 2010 and 2011 would, in part, address economic challenges and bolster efforts to help first-time buyers. </p> <p>Speaking to a sell-out audience in the capital, Salmond also detailed efforts to boost tourism, ease planning restrictions and focus capital spending to promote growth.</p> <p>\"We face, as a country, economic challenges, some of these we face in common with the western world,\" Salmond said. </p> <p>\"We also face a situation where our determination over macroeconomic policy is extremely limited. Nonetheless, I think it's right and proper that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/Scotland\">Scottish government</a> commits itself to focus on efforts towards a single overarching purpose of increasing sustainable economic growth in Scotland.\"<br> He added: \"More than that I want to restate a basic contention of the government. That there is every reason to be confident in the future of the Scottish economy, our workforce and businesses and this country's ability to define and seize new economic opportunities.\"</p> <p>Salmond said Scotland's international reputation was growing. </p> <p> \"Other people, right now, see Scotland not as backmarkers but as frontrunners. There is no doubt, in this decade, since Donald Dewar reopened the Scottish parliament, the nation is growing in confidence and stature, and today in the parliament, we see a different political culture struggling to emerge. </p> <p>\"The old lobbying culture, is giving way, in my opinion to a more open, flexible democratic chamber based on multiple coalitions of ideas and aspirations. In our people we see a new ambition, taking pride in this country and its potential, with the confidence to elect a government that unashamedly puts Scottish interests first. </p> <p>\"In short, across the whole of society Scotland is moving forward whatever the short-term smoke of difficulties in the economy. </p> <p>\"We welcome the new confident nation. We are proud to serve it. Thanks to the work of the democratic pioneers such as Donald Dewar, whatever the constitutional configuration of our country we can stand the opportunity to be one of the true successes of the 21st century.\" </p> <p>Asked by a member of the audience if he could effect a second \"political earthquake\" by winning the upcoming <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/glenrothes\">Glenrothes byelection</a> in the same way as he did in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/glasgoweast\">Glasgow East</a>, Salmond quoted the golfer Gary Player, who, when told he was lucky to have won a match, replied that the more he practised the luckier he got. </p> <p>\"In Central Fife I can promise you the SNP will be practising hard and will be taking nothing for granted and we will be working as hard, if not harder than we worked in Glasgow East,\" Salmond said. \"I think the folk in Glasgow East didn't make a mistake. They knew what they were doing.\"</p> <p>The Glenrothes seat became vacant following the recent death of Labour MP John MacDougall. MacDougall had a 10,600 majority but the seat is considered vulnerable to a resurgent SNP. </p> <p>Salmond refused to say that the loss of Glenrothes would prove the fatal blow for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordonbrown\">Gordon Brown</a>'s leadership, but he said he did have a message for the prime minister.</p> <p>\"Gordon does not have his problems to seek,\" he said. \"I have two pieces of advice. Change his policies and cheer up, for God's sake.\"</p>",
  "<p>It has been a difficult couple of weeks in thinktank land. First the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/08/thinktanks.gordonbrown\">Smith Institute</a> was rapped over the knuckles by the Charity Commission for allowing itself \"to become exposed to concerns it had supported government policy and was involved in party political activity inappropriate for a charity\" \u2013 and lost both its chairman and director. Then Policy Exchange, described as \"David Cameron's favourite thinktank\", issued a report suggesting that the population of the north may be better off being shipped down to new towns in the south. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/13/regeneration.conservatives?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=networkfront\">Tim Leunig</a>, the report's co-author admitted some of his ideas might seem \"barmy\": and in this, at least, he was right.</p> <p>Both incidents point to a constant tension for all the thinktanks, which is how they position themselves politically. Under charity rules they are banned from engaging in party politics, but through their choice of personnel and subject matter it is usually clear where they stand. It would be madness to deny, for example, that the <a href=\"http://www.ippr.org.uk/\">Institute for Public Policy Research</a> is close to the Labour party when its alumni include David Miliband, Patricia Hewitt, Yvette Cooper, James Purnell and Dan Corry (current head of the No 10 Policy Unit). Likewise <a href=\"http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/\">Policy Exchange</a> and the Conservatives: two of its last three directors, Anthony Browne and Nick Boles, now work for Boris Johnson while the third, James O'Shaughnessy, is now policy director for David Cameron. </p> <p>Thinktanks exist to bring fresh ideas to bear in policymaking and politics. They win their influence either through intimacy with their principal political \"clients\" or through independent technical expertise. They are listened to either in the way that you might listen to your spouse or your GP. The intimacy model guarantees media coverage because political journalists can easily make a story out of a report from a thinktank that represents a particular party or faction within a party. But this is a double-edged sword, as Policy Exchange discovered to their cost last week. In reality of course, thinktanks strike a balance between the two, and most aim to be critical friends of their political soulmates rather than getting into bed with them. </p> <p>At the same time, it is inevitable that the shifting sands of politics will ensure that there is at least one \"hot\" thinktank, the one associated with the coming forces in politics and which finds it easiest to raise money \u2013 and raise a stink. Right now the thinktanks closest to Cameron are enjoying these mixed blessings; but IPPR, the Adam Smith Institute, the Centre for Policy Studies and Demos have all had their moments in the sun, too.</p> <p>Looking forward, the erosion of the lines between the parties in many areas of policy and ideology suggests that a looser relationship to specific political groupings might be appropriate: <a href=\"http://www.demos.co.uk/\">Demos</a>, for example, aims to be intensely political but not party-political. So long as a thinktank is clear about its intellectual centre of gravity, it ought to be able to engage with politicians from across the spectrum.<br> Some are now wondering whether the whole thinktank model is bust. The Labour minister Jim Knight suggests on his Facebook page that thinktanks, \"ultimately very elitist top-down institutions populated with very bright people who politicians sometimes seem to sub-contract their thinking to\", are out of date in an era of online networking, blogs and wikipedia. \"Network-enabled policymaking\" may replace boring old thinktank reports, he says.</p> <p>The transmission, testing and collision of ideas in an environment with the immediacy of the web is certainly a huge challenge for thinktanks: but surely an opportunity too. So long as think-tanks can demonstrate real expertise \u2013 be \"elitist\" in the best sense of the term \u2013 they should welcome the heat of online debate.</p> <p>And right now the political environment is an attractive one. Labour is trying to renew itself in office, a difficult task akin to fixing a car while driving it. The Liberal Democrats are anxious to build a distinctive political identity. And the Conservatives are searching for new ideas and intellectual frameworks to help them win and use power. So long as politicians are hungry for ideas, thinktanks have a bright future.</p>",
  "<p>If you want proof <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/20/water.food\">the world has a water problem</a> you're better treading the damp summer pavements of the City than the parched bed of the Aral Sea. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs says <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/money/article4086457.ece\">water is the next oil</a> and has bullish investment trends to prove it. For the rest of us a water boom spells trouble: investors can smell scarcity a mile off and, however much money they pump into managing it, the last result they'll want is abundance.</p> <p>It will be our plates, not our rates, that bear the brunt of water shortage. As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/20/water.food1\">today's report</a> from WWF spells out, the amount we spew out of taps is piddling compared with what it takes to make stuff and, especially, to grow our food.</p> <p>The volumes involved are staggering: the 200 billion litres a second it takes to grow the world's food is like gulping down the Amazon day in, day out. In the UK, we use about 58 bathtubs full of water every day, both directly and in the food we eat and the clothes we wear, and 62% of that comes from other countries. We're eating dry Lake Naivasha in Kenya and Australia's Murray River, as well as running down our own reserves.</p> <p>But our water problem isn't just about the amount we use. Quality is as crucial as quantity. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/water\">Whether water</a> is clean, dirty or briny, comes from groundwater or from rainfall, and its whereabouts, can make all the difference.</p> <p>To tackle water scarcity we need to remind ourselves why it is a problem. The most obvious reason is that we just can't keep using water at current rates. In practice, running low on a resource can mean that rich places like the UK barely notice while poor people take the hit. </p> <p>But we've been there already with water \u2013 other countries have suffered from scarcity for decades \u2013 and we're now at the point where even the big-name companies that feed us are feeling the squeeze and getting seriously worried about the security of their supply chains.</p> <p>But, just because this problem is now affecting rich countries, it doesn't mean we'll carry our fair share of the burden. So the second problem is injustice, destroying other people's livelihoods as we try to sort out our own supply problems. Just as pulling the rug from under the people who grow our airfreighted fruit and veg due to concerns over air miles is a problem, so too for water-scarce regions.</p> <p>Then there are ecological consequences of water scarcity: desiccation and poor water quality can destroy species and ecosystems.</p> <p>So, how to fix the water crisis? The good news is that we're not short of opportunities. The bad news is that many just swap one problem for another. The simplest technical fix is to use water more efficiently. The huge gap between the leakiest and most watertight irrigation systems shows we could get plenty more crop per drop. </p> <p>More ambitious is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desalination\">desalination</a> \u2013 already big in the Middle East, on the up in Spain and Australia, and plans are even afoot in London. The trouble with turning seawater fresh is the cost in money, energy and greenhouse gas emissions, not to mention the brine you're left with at the end.</p> <p>The economist's fix is to put a price on water. That we need to value water more is clear but everything hinges on how you go about it. Pricing water doesn't work if people use it on the sly \u2013 there are around half a million illegal wells in Spain alone \u2013 and it can push water out of reach of people who most need it to those who can most afford it.</p> <p>The foodie fix is to change what we eat. Meat is so thirsty that a vegetarian uses about half the water of a carnivore. The fact is that we will have to eat differently \u2013 the cost will force us to whether we want to or not. But if we want to be ahead of the game, the devil is in the detail: crops such as rice are heavy water users while extensive livestock can in fact tread quite lightly. One crucial shift may be towards crops more amenable to rain-watered farming, which uses only what is available. The fact that two-thirds of the world's food isn't irrigated right now reminds us this isn't an impossible dream.</p> <p>Food is right at the heart of water scarcity but changing what we eat is just one part of the solution. Unless we get better policies in place too, we're likely to displace the problem instead of solving it, replacing irrigated Spanish greenhouses that supply our winter salads with irrigated Spanish golf courses.</p> <p>So we need to do more with our food than simply eat a diet for a drier planet: as customers, shareholders and concerned citizens, we need to persuade food companies to put their political clout to good use, supporting fair ways to govern water in the places that they buy from. That means involving all water users, including those who can't pay for it, in setting priorities and making sure that their needs and those of the environment are met. It means valuing water, not merely as a commodity, but as the very stuff of life.</p> <p>\u00b7 Tom MacMillan is executive director of the <a href=\"http://www.foodethicscouncil.org/node/342\">Food Ethics Council</a>, which earlier this year published Water: the ethics of efficiency</p>",

But it has endured a rocky year.</p> <p>When Louis Vuitton won a high-profile French court case over fake goods, analysts questioned its capacity for growth and some of its hitherto loyal band of sellers staged an open revolt over changes to its fee structure. </p> <p>As it faces a wave of renewed competition from online competitors like Amazon and so-called \"bricks and clicks\" players such as Tesco combining shops and the internet, eBay UK will today unveil several changes it says are designed to help those entrepreneurs make the most of fixed-price sales. </p> <p>Upfront fees for listing items will be slashed and the fee for a successful sale will be increased in an effort to get buyers to list a wider range of goods and increase choice. Sellers will receive discounts on those fees and better search listings according to the volume of sales and quality of service. </p> <p>Though critics fear the moves will benefit the big retail partners that eBay is looking to attract at the expense of smaller traders, eBay executives insist that both can profitably co-exist. </p> <p>And in an effort to counter persistent fears that customers risk being ripped off by unscrupulous sellers, eBay will raise the protection for anyone paying for goods through its own PayPal system from \u00a3500 to \u00a330,000. </p> <p>It will highlight the fact that 43% of its global sales are at a fixed price - a figure that has grown by 60% over the past six years and is quickly catching the revenues generated by the auctions. </p> <p>Though today's changes may appear inconsequential to non-users of the site, for its 15 million monthly visitors - and in particular to the 178,000 bedroom entrepreneurs who have been able to quit their jobs to trade on eBay full time - they are crucial. </p> <p>\"We've been on this path for the last few years,\" said Clare Gilmartin, director of marketplaces for eBay in the UK. \"There's no doubt this year has seen some very, very bold changes - necessarily so and entirely reflective of what our buyers and sellers want.\"</p> <p>She said that the shift from auction sales to fixed price was an indication of how online retailing had matured, growing from 1% to 17% of the overall market in the nine years since eBay launched in Britain. Auctions would remain popular for collectables and one-off sales, she said, but that in many product categories people preferred to buy at the click of a mouse. </p> <p>\"I don't think anything can surpass eBay in terms of choice. But e-commerce is now mainstream. We see our competitive set as a broad one - anywhere where a buyer can buy stuff online. That might be Amazon or the more traditional bricks and clicks. But the big advantage we have is choice - mums sitting alongside entrepreneurs, sitting alongside big retailers.\" </p> <p>Dan Lumb, head of e-commerce at Schuh, has built an eBay business selling 150,000 pairs of shoes a year as it has used the site to sell discounted stock. He said it was \"inevitable\" that small business users would feel \"a bit disgruntled\" at bigger retailers moving on to the site. </p> <p>But he added: \"I think there's room for everybody. At the end of the day, having big brands on there helps legitimise eBay as a marketplace. Having big retailers on there makes it more exciting as a buying experience.\"</p> <p>EBay has positioned itself as a consumer champion, uniting buyers and sellers and allowing small businesses to compete with big high-street names. The revolt in the US this year risked damaging that image. </p> <p>It came after Meg Whitman, the chief executive who had overseen its phenomenal growth for a decade, made way in January for John Donahoe to give the company \"a fresh pair of eyes\". Though her tenure was generally considered a huge success, she left to a chorus of criticism after admitting that the company seriously overpaid for the internet telephony company Skype, acquired for $2.6bn in October 2005. </p> <p>Last month, a court ordered eBay to pay Louis Vuitton $61m (\u00a332.7m) over sales of fake handbags and perfume. EBay is challenging the ruling and was recently cheered by victories over Tiffany and L'Or\u00e9al, which were trying to make the website liable for counterfeit goods sold through the site. </p> <p>Gilmartin predicted the changes would kickstart another wave of growth for the site, noting a surge in demand for clothing, homewares and garden items in recent years. </p> <p>\"We hope to see significant increase in the choice our sellers give to buyers,\" she said. \"If you are a buyer and searching on eBay, you'll have far more chance of finding what you are looking for. In a credit crunch environment, it's far easier to shop around online for a bargain than it is offline.\"</p> <h2>Case study: The trader</h2> <p>When Chris Dawson was made redundant from his job in IT sales, he decided to tide himself over by selling furniture for a friend through eBay. Four and a half years later, he has yet to return to work.</p> <p>He is one of 178,000 people making their primary or secondary living from the site, running a computer accessories business with sales of more than \u00a36,000 a month. As co-founder of the blog TameBay, he also has a unique insight into the often vociferous community of small sellers that have helped eBay expand into a $60bn global business but periodically threaten its future. He said some of the smaller sellers, particularly those who may be reliant on the site to meet mortgage payments or other outgoings, tended to be among the most resistant to change.</p> <p>\"Any change to the site that benefits one seller automatically disadvantages others. The sellers who are disadvantaged will always shout the loudest,\" he said. </p> <p>Theoretically, he said, lower upfront fees should help small businesses because they can offer a wider range of stock. But they could also favour bigger retailers because cheaper fees will allow them simply to list their entire catalogue. </p> <p>Dawson said eBay had been unsympathetic to the effects of changes to its fee structure and feedback system on smaller sellers but credited it with becoming more open in the past year. \"EBay has realised there is quite a lot of fear among sellers,\" he said. \"They are realising that sellers are eBay customers too and listening to their customers.\" </p> <p>He said some of eBay's longest-serving users wore rose-tinted spectacles. \"People forget the internet has changed. When eBay started out, a lot was taken on trust and people were sending envelopes stuffed with dollars across the Atlantic. Now, with instant payments, buyers are expecting better service and almost instant delivery.\"</p> <p>But he said the auction site also had to raise its game to meet new challengers. \"If eBay doesn't take steps to ensure its sellers are providing the right level of service and customer satisfaction, it will fail. Buyers will go to Amazon or Argos instead. Amazon is doing really well and sellers are flocking to Amazon. You can buy almost anything on eBay. The challenge is to make sure you can carry on doing that and maintain a good level of service. It's a hard tightrope to walk.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Chris Dawson makes a living selling computer accessories through eBay and also runs <br><a href=\"http://www.tamebay.com\">TameBay.com</a></p>",
  "<p>On a dry salt lake deep in the remote west Australian outback, a British engineer is preparing for the ride of his life \u2013 powered by nothing but the wind. </p> <p>Richard Jenkins hopes the perfect gust will blow his high-tech buggy to 120mph and into the record books. If he succeeds, it will mark the end of a decade-long quest for the wind-powered landspeed record. It would also convince him that a greater goal is within reach: by swapping the wheels on his craft for ice skates, and windswept Australia for the frozen wilderness of North America, Jenkins wants to go faster still, and become the swiftest naturally propelled human on the planet.</p> <p>Jenkins is currently making final preparations for the landspeed record bid at Lake Lefroy, 300 miles from Perth. Heavy rain has delayed the effort, but a suitable window of dry and windy weather is expected to open within days.</p> <p>His craft borrows technology from Formula One racing cars and has more in common with an airplane than a sailing ship. While conventional land yachts have a flexible sail, this vehicle has a rigid vertical wing, which generates thrust in the same way as a conventional aircraft wing produces lift. Combined with its streamlined shape, this allows the craft to travel at up to six times the speed of the wind.</p> <p>Jenkins said: \"Top speed is actually quite scary. The structure and tyre grip is all at the limit, so keeping it in a straight line under full control takes full concentration.\" </p> <p>Trials in 2007 had to be aborted because of difficulty harnessing the immense power generated in even light winds. On a Nevada salt lake in 2005, Jenkins lost control at 106mph. \"The winds out there are much more unpredictable, and in search of the perfect gust, I sailed into a pretty violent wind and dust storm. I lost steerage and span for about a quarter mile. Stopped when I hit the scrub on the edge of the lake.\" To achieve the high speeds, the craft does not travel straight downwind but at an angle.</p> <p>The existing record of 116.7mph was set in 1999 by the American Bob Schumacher in his \"Iron Duck\" craft. Jenkins says he has already beaten that twice, in practice runs on the 3000m tarmac runway at RAF Waddington in Lincolnshire. His claimed speed of more than 120mph remains unofficial because there were no independent observers. In 2002, Jenkins officially clocked 113mph there, enough to set a new British record. The world record needs to be set on a natural surface, which rules out the UK.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336776020\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2008/8/19/1219141923913/RichardJenkins.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Jenkins\" width=\"220\" height=\"321\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard Jenkins</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He said: \"I have tried every year, with different vehicles in different continents, but it is a tough challenge. The previous record holders spent five years on standby, waiting for the perfect day, and they live there, in the desert. If you have to travel overseas, assemble a team, the vehicle, official observers and a film crew, for ratification purposes as required by the Americans, and the perfect wind, it takes many attempts.\"</p> <p>This month's attempt will see Jenkins race the fifth version of his wind-driven vehicle, which was originally called Windjet, but has now been renamed <a href=\"http://www.greenbird.co.uk/\">Greenbird</a>, as a nod to Donald Campbell's Bluebird, under a sponsorship deal with UK renewable energy firm Ecotricity. A second seat has been fitted, to allow Dale Vince, Ecotricity's managing director, along for the ride.</p> <p>Vince said: \"Campbell made his record attempts in what historians will look back on as the golden age of fossil fuels. Fast forward 80 years and we are coming to the end of the age of fossil fuels and the dawn of the age of renewables. The Greenbird symbolises this historical watershed.\" Ecotricity says it will incorporate some of the craft's design into its wind turbines.</p> <p>The weather at Lake Lefroy is expected to allow record attempts until the middle of next month. On a good day, the team could make up to 40 runs, covering more than 200 miles.</p> <p>Because the craft is optimised for top speeds, it is relatively slow off the mark and can take 40 seconds to reach 50mph, more than twice as slow as a Robin Reliant. Acceleration beyond that point is more rapid, and it can reach 100mph in just another 10 seconds.</p> <p>From September, the team's attention will switch to running the craft on ice. Despite wild pre-war claims for speeds as high as 140mph, the generally agreed record for an ice yacht is 80mph.</p> <p>Jenkins says, in theory, ice should be a lot faster than land, and that 150mph is a reasonable target. \"But my experience on land tells me it is all much harder than you think. It is not out of the question that there may be a fundamental reason why it is impossible to travel fast on ice due to the skate-ice interaction at high loads and speeds.\"</p> <p>A speed of 150mph would be tantalisingly close to the ultimate speed record for an Earth-bound non-motorised human, which was set at 156mph by the Italian speed skier Simone Origone in 2006. Free from the surly bonds of Earth, the Austrian speed skydiver Alexander Diem reached an eyewatering 313mph during a jump in 2007.</p>"
