  "<p><strong>Armani Knowles better</strong></p> <p>It never hurts to be related to a megastar. Or so we've heard. For lo, Beyonce Knowles's little sister Solange has been snapped up by Giorgio Armani to model his latest denim range. Solange will be what the designers like to call an ambassador for the brand. Alas, this post does not come with UN entry card and diplomatic immunity - she just gets to wear some Armani jeans during her current press tour. Apparently she's not just a sibling, but an actress and singer too. </p> <p><strong>Slip us a diamond, please?</strong></p> <p>Those who might be fretting that the theatrical revival of <a href=\"http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/calendar/productions/the-wizard-of-oz-39120\">The Wizard of Oz</a> at the Royal Festival Hall just might not be kitsch enough, feel at ease. Swarovski, who apparently were makers of the original ruby slippers (we thought it was a witch?) have made a new pair for the show. In fact the production will be dripping in Swarovski bling, so we recommend you take along your oh-so-fashionable Wayfarers. </p> <p><strong>Forget G8, Surya is the place to be</strong></p> <p>Ethical fashionistas, here's a date for your non-leather diaries: next Tuesday, August 12, there's an eco-fashion party at the Surya in King's Cross.

The glossy magazines are touting it as one of the hottest trends for autumn/winter. All very well on a ball dress, but really, is the Victorian fancy trims effect workable for mere mortals? We think we run the risk of looking like Miss Havisham.</p> <p><strong>I like her tight sweater</strong></p> <p>Move over SJP - Roisin Murphy could be the new style icon for our times. After getting through at least ten outfit changes at Glastonbury, the ex-Moloko singer was seen donning on-trend purple headwear at Global Gathering. Indeed, Tilda Swinton's kookiest Brit fashion crown is facing a serious challenge. No stranger to avant-garde couture, she donned Gareth Pugh in her Overpowered video, and with the outrageous pompom shock-frock that graced her album cover, she's even giving Bjork a run for her money.</p> <p><strong>Paris versus Fergie</strong></p> <p>Over the pond, it's celebrity shoe wars: whose A-list-branded slipper will take out the eye of rival designer wannabes quickest?

  "<p>The US mortgage finance empire Freddie Mac yesterday predicted the worst housing slump since the Great Depression as it set aside $2.5bn (\u00a31.28bn) to cover credit liabilities caused by delinquent loans and foreclosures.</p> <p>Two weeks after the US government hastily assembled a rescue package to support the business, Freddie revealed a second-quarter loss of $821m - a big jump in comparison with its first-quarter deficit of $151m.</p> <p>Richard Syron, chief executive of Freddie Mac, said: \"As we're all painfully aware, the housing correction has had a significant impact on the US economy.\" He admitted that the credit environment was deteriorating \"even faster than we thought\".</p> <p>The government-sponsored company has a loan portfolio of more than $1.5tn. Along with its sister firm, Fannie Mae, it buys mortgages from lenders and securitises them on the financial markets in its mission to broaden access to home ownership.</p> <p>Syron predicted yesterday that the American housing slump would be even deeper than anticipated. He said the company believed prices would drop by between 18% and 20% from their peak, exceeding its earlier forecast of 15%. In a statement, the company said it was \"in the midst of the single largest decline in real estate values since the Great Depression\". </p> <p>Syron said: \"Today's challenging economic environment suggests the housing market is far from stabilising. We now think we're about halfway through the peak-to-trough decline.\"</p> <p>Alarm about the financial position of Fannie and Freddie has sent shares in the two companies plummeting by more than 80% this year. Freddie's loss, which was significantly greater than analysts had predicted, sent its stock down by 15% in early trading on Wall Street.</p> <p>Freddie intends to raise $5.5bn of new capital to bolster its reserves and is slashing its dividend. The company insisted that its cash remained above regulatory targets - it has $37.1bn of core capital, which is $2.7bn more than the surplus required by the US government.</p> <p>Congress recently nodded through a bill allowing the US treasury to lend money or buy shares in Freddie and Fannie to keep the businesses afloat. Economists fear that a collapse of one or both could have grave repercussions throughout the financial system. Between them, they back more than half of new US mortgages.</p> <p>Syron said he did not believe such drastic taxpayer support would be needed: \"While we do not expect to draw on any of the new backstops going forward, they provide important sources of reassurance and potential support in the event that the housing market declines even further than anticipated.\"</p> <p>Analysts believe investors are likely to attach stringent terms to any fundraising by the company. Walter O'Haire, of the Boston financial consultancy Celent, said: \"What will be interesting to see are the terms investors will demand in return for buying into Freddie Mac's proposed $5.5bn stock offering.\"</p>",
  "<p>A wholesale review of the conditions attached to benefits, including those given to lone parents, the unemployed and the disabled, has been ordered by the work and pensions secretary, James Purnell.</p> <p>The review started this week and is to be undertaken by Paul Gregg, a Bristol University academic who has specialised in the interaction between benefits and income.</p> <p>The review is in addition to the proposals set out to tighten welfare rules published in the welfare green paper announced before the summer recess by Purnell.</p> <p>A paper accompanying the review is largely sympathetic to the idea of tightening conditions, both as a way of reducing abuse and to bring the unemployed closer to the world of work. It appears to favour regular interviews for those receiving benefits with personal advisers and clearer sanctions, such as losing benefit, or part of the benefit.</p> <p>The review will look at how the latest behavioural economics can motivate those on welfare and what the right conditions are for the long-term unemployed or those thought to be abusing the system.</p> <p>Ministers believe the regime of conditions for different benefits has evolved since the 1980s without any great logic.</p> <p>The paper accompanying the launch of the review points out that sanctions are imposed on 30,000 people on the New Deal each year, representing one in seven of those who enter the programme. </p> <p>It also points out that 11% of those on the New Deal for young people leave before their first interview. </p> <p>A further 55% leave during the 16-week \"Gateway stage\", at the end of which claimants face the prospect of at least 13 weeks of full-time activities. The paper also suggests that the jobseeker's allowance regime for the adult unemployed, including the introduction of fortnightly job interviews, reduced the claimant count by eight percentage points, representing \"good value for money\".</p> <p>The Department for Work and Pensions research suggests that the introduction of tougher rules for those on incapacity benefit, including a requirement to attend a work-focused interview, have been financially worthwhile with the exchequer saving \u00a31.50 for every \u00a31 invested.</p> <p>Survey work carried out by the DWP showed that more than half of claimants say they are more likely to look for work because of the threat of sanctions. </p> <p>It also suggests attaching conditions to welfare can draw on the latest British interest in nudge economics, and the hidden art of persuasion. </p> <p>It suggests the welfare review should look at aversion to loss, including loss of high regard in the community; respect for legitimate authority; reciprocity - including a sense of obligation to give something back; and finally social proof, responding to the behaviour of others, such as their successful search for work.</p>",
  "<p>In those sunny days when Michael Grade arrived at ITV, there were meant to be two reasons to buy the shares. One: the showman would restore swagger to the organisation and ITV would start to deliver on its targets. Two: the regulators would remove the supposed regulatory straitjacket on the company.</p> <p>The first argument now seems weak. It was only last September when Grade set out his turnaround plan and already two of his targets have been deemed unachievable. Kiss goodbye to global content sales of \u00a31.2bn by 2012; shareholders must now be grateful if they see \u00a31bn. As for online revenues of \u00a3150m - which never seemed terribly ambitious - they will arrive two years behind schedule in 2012.</p> <p>Naturally, Grade offers explanations. The television advertising market has fallen off a cliff and the Kangaroo online venture is stuck with the regulators. Fair enough, but the disappointment is that Grade's new-look ITV hasn't put up a better fight.</p> <p>His fans argue that the business is outperforming the TV market for the first time in a decade or two. Alternatively, you could say the lost ground is being regained terribly slowly. The hope was that ITV could buck a weak advertising market, as it did in the first half of this year. Instead, a deep autumn chill has set in. The share price has been predicting as much for months and, as so often, the stock market was right.</p> <p>No wonder Grade was so anxious to make the case for regulatory reform. \"What is at stake,\" he said, \"is ITV's position as one of the three pillars of UK broadcasting, alongside the BBC and BSkyB.\" In other words: come on, regulators, throw us a lifeline, we're sinking here.</p> <p>It's a dramatic statement and, of course, it's true that there is much at stake. ITV puts its regulatory burden at \u00a3300m a year - that's the cost of its public service obligations and the pain of the contract rights renewal (CRR) system. If the company could recoup even half that, the picture would improve radically.</p> <p>The mood music is encouraging only in part. Ofcom seems inclined to lift many of the public service obligations, some of which seem genuinely to belong to another era. Why, for example, do so many programmes have to be made outside London? But, despite Grade's pleas for \"urgent\" action, it's not obvious why the timetable for CRR should be shortened. The arrangement, guaranteeing discounts to advertisers, was invented by ITV itself to allow the merger of Carlton and Granada in 2004. ITV was gambling that it could keep its ITV1 audiences high. It lost the bet, and so have its shareholders: the dividend has been cut in half. That's life.</p> <p>The current share price - 43.5p - looks absurdly low to many. But is it low enough for potential bidders? There are plenty of rumours, but trade buyers, such as RTL, are hardly booming themselves these days. Private equity looks like a non-starter because ITV can't support more debt and Grade couldn't roll over at a price below 100p. In the short term, then, ITV looks like a punt on the regulators being nice. What if they're not?</p> <h2>Minefield</h2> <p>Conventional wisdom says Lonmin doesn't have a hope of surviving Xstrata's hostile \u00a35bn offer. The bidder bagged 10% of the shares in a dusk raid, and many of the obvious white knights are off the pitch. Competition issues probably disqualify Anglo American while two other big beasts - BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto - decline to mine platinum on the grounds that too many miners are killed because of the relative lack of mechanisation.</p> <p>Worse, Lonmin's production performance has disappointed. As if to emphasise the point, the company further downgraded this year's forecast yesterday. Investors are also fretting about commodity prices generally, and there is a particular worry about platinum because much of the output goes to the US car industry. So Xstrata starts with a strong hand.</p> <p>But many Lonmin shareholders may feel the bid is too opportunistic by half. Yes, Lonmin has underperformed, but the argument is also about the value of the platinum in the ground. Lonmin has 30 years' supply - plenty of time for the Chinese car drivers to support the price of the metal.</p> <p>It's also too early to give up on counter-bids. Impala, a fellow platinum miner in South Africa, failed on competition grounds a couple of years ago but it is not clear whether it would still be ruled offside. And who knows what could emerge from Russian and Chinese miners?</p> <p>Mick Davis, Xstrata's chief executive, played tough by opting for a hostile bid on day one. Lonmin's job is to play for time. If the platinum price improves, \u00a333 a share - which was seen as recently as May - doesn't have to be a knock-out.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:nils.pratley@theguardian.com\">nils.pratley@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>A panel of top Wall Street bankers has recommended cigarette-style health warnings on complex financial instruments and suggests that ill-considered bonus packages may be encouraging financiers to take excessive risks.</p> <p>In a 176-page report on the credit crunch, an industry-wide group of senior executives has called for a package of changes to disclosure, governance and stress-testing at banks, along with restrictions on the sale of potentially toxic derivatives.</p> <p>Chaired by a Goldman Sachs managing director, Gerald Corrigan, the group blamed age-old human foibles for the global financial crisis but added that distorted pay structures may have contributed by encouraging gung-ho behaviour.</p> <p>\"The root cause of financial market excesses on both the upside and the downside of the cycle is collective human behaviour - unbridled optimism on the upside and fear, bordering on panic, on the downside,\" it said. </p> <p>While not criticising the size of City and Wall Street bonuses, the panel was critical of how pay deals are put together, saying incentives had \"inadvertently produced patterns of behaviour and allocations of resources\" that were inconsistent with \"the basic goal of financial stability\".</p> <p>Members of the Counterparty Risk Management Policy Group include representatives from HSBC, Citigroup, Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley, BNP Paribas and Merrill Lynch. In a striking recommendation, they said complex instruments should only be sold to carefully vetted, sophisticated clients with the means to withstand heavy losses and analyse the risks involved.</p> <p>These investments, the panel said, should come with details of terms and characteristics. This should have a \"financial health warning\" in bold print to alert investors to the risk of \"significant loss\".</p> <p>The bankers called for regular meetings between regulators and the boards of financial institutions. They suggested improved stress-testing by banks, brainstorming to identify risky \"hotspots\" and frank disclosure of assets held off banks' balance sheets using a \"holistic and principles-based approach\".</p> <p>Since it began with a meltdown in the sub-prime mortgage market a year ago, the credit crunch has led to the collapse of the fifth largest US investment bank, Bear Stearns, troubles at banks around the world including Britain's Northern Rock, and write-offs and loss provisions approaching $500bn (\u00a3250bn). </p> <p>Many argue that the banking crisis has been aggravated by \"creativity\" within institutions in coming up with increasingly esoteric financial products, including collateralised debt obligations, auction-rate securities and credit default swaps.</p>",
  "<p>There's something about <strong>Lost Land of the Jaguar</strong> (BBC1) that hints at fiction. That title, for a start: it could be a Hollywood movie, maybe something to do with Mel Gibson. </p> <p>And the whole situation: a bunch of scientists, camped on a bend in the river in the middle of nowhere, studying the jungle, while the jungle studies them back.</p> <p>I keep expecting a meeting with an undiscovered ancient civilisation. The spider expert will be captured, then dragged by his hair to the top of a steep pyramid, where the high priest, half-man, half-jaguar, will rip his still-beating heart from his chest. Or perhaps they'll bump into the survivors of a 1960s plane crash, lost in the forest for ever. Or a man raised by apes. </p> <p>Aaaaah-ayaheee-aaaaah.</p> <p>Maybe some of that happens in part three next week. For now, though, we have to make do with what they find in and around their jungle camp. No, make do isn't the right verb; it doesn't do justice to the creatures they come across. Man, they've got some epic fauna in Guyana: monkeys with the faces of elves; spiders the size of small ponies. The whole place is knee-deep in killer-scorpions which glow in the dark. </p> <p>The best stuff is in the river. Sabre-tooth fish swim around, slicing up anything in their path. Huge, melancholy-looking yellow catfish make sad <br>sighing noises. Even bigger caiman lurk, welcoming little fishes in, with gently smiling jaws - and stray BBC people, most probably. But best (actually worst) of all is the candiru. This little fellow - a translucent eel with razor-sharp, backwards-facing spines - has a nasty trick. It likes to swim up a human penis, hook on up there, in the urethra, and slowly drain the owner of his blood. I hate that - when a fish swim up your penis, especially the spiny, blood-sucking kind. Oh and ladies, you're not safe either: if there are no willies in the water, guess where their second favourite place in the whole world is.</p> <p>It's lovely to see the science dudes getting so excited about all this stuff. I particularly like the bearded spider man, the one who got sacrificed in my fantasy. Every day here must be like Christmas for him. When a skeleton tarantula catches a cicada in their camp, he can't hide his excitement. \"I'm loving this,\" he squeals, as the spider carves up the hapless bug with its enormous fangs. \"This is it!\"</p> <p>When they're not running around after animals, they pretend to be them. The climbing people go off to scale an unclimbed mountain, a massive sheer rock that sticks out of the jungle like an iceberg. Surely it's created by CGI? No, because up they go. And when night falls, and they're not even half way up, they just tie themselves to the sheer rock face, and go to sleep. Like bats, hanging in the dark.</p> <p>That's where the weird stuff's going to be, on top of that mountain. Look at it, disappearing into the clouds. How can there not be something a bit spooky up there? Next week ...</p> <p><strong>Dangerous Jobs for Girls</strong> (Channel 4) is much less satisfying. We're in another forest, this time in Canada. No tarantulas, just rednecks. Three high-achieving British women are off to British Columbia to try their hand at logging. It's that old idea - putting people in an alien environment, hoping something interesting might come out of it, preferably conflict. </p> <p>We're constantly reminded how incredibly tough and dangerous this job is, that people are constantly dying. The camera frequently focuses on the magazine pictures of naked women on the walls of the loggers' camp. Hell, it's all going to go off when these city girls from England show up, with their fancy ideas of equality. </p> <p>Except it doesn't, really. The loggers may not be exactly metrosexual, but neither are they Beavis and Butthead. And the women aren't man-haters. There are a few differences of opinion, but generally they get along fine and respect each other. </p> <p>The ladies aren't very good at logging to begin with, as you'd expect - they've never logged before, and they're not as big as the big rednecks. But they get better at it. And in the end, two of them cut down a tree. Nice for them, maybe - not so interesting for us. I'm not sure who's learned what, or why. Perhaps it's time for this type of programme to go away.</p>",
  "<p>One rescuer has a scratch down her right arm, another has been nipped just under her left eye. They are all exhausted and trailing the distinctive ammonia aroma of the chicken shed. But the mood among the members of Brighton Animal Action, an animal rights group that rescues \"spent hens\" from chicken farms, is jubilant. From one farm alone, they have already sent more than 5,000 Rhode Island Reds to new homes around the country, and they only have another 4,000 or so to go.</p> <p>\"We started on Monday,\" explains Tara Maher, one of BAA's members standing inside a vast shed somewhere in south-east England. (The farmer wishes to remain anonymous.) \"We worked for about 13 hours straight, clearing that big shed over there. Then we started on this shed here. It was absolutely full to the brim. We'll finish this off today, and start on the last shed tomorrow.\"</p> <p>The hens, which have been reared as organic birds, have had to stay in their sheds while the rescuers work. Now, three days into the rescue, there are only a few left, pecking about at the back, looking around curiously as rescuers gently pick them up to pack them up in boxes for their journeys.</p> <p>Unlike battery chickens, which get slaughtered at 52 weeks, these organic hens are 72 weeks old. They are in good condition, healthy with full plumage and bright red combs. Left to themselves, given a bit of food, some dust and shade, they will live on for up to six years. Some even live to the grand old age of 10. But under the economic realities that dictate life and death in today's farmyard, they would now all be dead.</p> <p>Bought by the farmer as chicks from a pullet farm, hens will typically begin to produce eggs at 18-22 weeks. More than 50% of eggs bought by consumers in this country are now produced by free-range or organic hens, but most of the eggs used in the catering industry are still battery, so battery hens remain in the majority. Battery cages are due to become illegal across Europe in 2012, but \"enriched cages\" (larger cages with nesting and perching places) will replace many of them. It is feared that cheap imports from outside Europe will then flood the market, with few, if any, guarantees about the living conditions of those birds.</p> <p>From 18 weeks onwards, a chicken begins to produce six to seven eggs a week: if she lives in a battery cage then artificial lighting might convince her to lay even more frequently. Finally, usually at around 72 weeks, her productivity starts to significantly decline and the eggs will start to vary in size, which makes it hard for the farmer to sell them to picky supermarket buyers. The chicken is now officially uneconomic, so she is packed off to the slaughterhouse, from where her meat will be used in products such as stock cubes, pet food and pies.</p> <p>But in recent years an increasing number of campaigners have taken exception to the brutally short life of the typical egg-laying hen and decided to do something about it. In 2003, Jane Howorth set up the Battery Hen Welfare Trust, which takes battery hens - \"ex-bats\" as she calls them - and finds them new homes. The BHWT's patrons include Jamie Oliver, who co-led a much-debated awareness campaign in January highlighting the stark conditions most chickens endure on our farms.</p> <p>\"We work very carefully with the farmers,\" says Howorth. \"It's very important that they feel supported too, instead of berated by the public. They are afraid that if they don't produce eggs cheaply enough, then the import market will overtake them. The responsibility for how these animals are kept needs to be shifted away from the farmers and on to the shoulders of the consumers.\"</p> <p>Howorth's organisation has collected nearly 100,000 ex-bats since 2003 and taken them to new homes where they can continue to produce eggs and enjoy a dignified retirement. \"People adore them,\" she says. \"They love to get these little animals into a free-range environment, just to see the birds enjoying themselves, running freely. They can come in all sorts of conditions, so it's very satisfying to see them going off to their free-range retirement. Chickens have real characters: they can be very curious and cheeky. They're like little cats and dogs with feathers.\"</p> <p>But there are some concerns about the increasing number of chickens being re-housed instead of being slaughtered: both the BHWT and BAA argue that they both take all the necessary precautions, but Lesley Cooper, who runs Trallwm Farm animal sanctuary in Carmarthenshire, worries that other organisations carrying out similar operations might be increasing the risk of spreading avian flu as the birds are transported. She also worries that farmers are beginning to see animal rescuers as a cheap, easy way of getting rid of spent chickens. If so, would it really be feasible for all battery chickens to be re-housed? That would mean some 10m hens each year looking for a home. There is clearly only a finite number of people willing to take on spent hens as pets at home, which is where the vast majority are relocated.</p> <p>Finally, is it financially viable for the farmer to keep the birds longer and slow down the break-neck pace of egg laying? The decision about that rests, as Howorth has pointed out, with the consumer: if we want eggs that cost a pound or so for half a dozen, then the quality of the chicken's life is pretty immaterial.</p> <p>But Maher and the crew of volunteers with her are, for the moment, unbothered by the larger questions. They have been carrying out these rescues for three years now, after the farmer contacted them and asked if the BAA could help out: for the first couple of years they were rehousing 3,000-4,000 birds, but this year it will be nearer 10,000.</p> <p>\"I dream about chickens,\" says Maher. \"I lie in bed and I see lists of all the places I need to send them to scrolling down in front of my eyes. They have completely taken over my life. But they're such great animals, very curious and affectionate. As an animal rights activist, it's really nice to do something positive like this. We've been absolutely flooded with offers of help and volunteers because it's fine to be campaigning and protesting, but people really want to be active and positive.\"</p> <p>The bird she has tucked under her arm cocks her head, and Tara scratches her wings. \"They're much maligned birds, chickens.\"</p>",
  "<p>American authorities have uncovered a global computer hacking and credit card fraud ring spanning the US, eastern Europe and Asia, officials said.</p> <p>Eleven people from the US, China and three former Soviet republics have been charge with stealing more than 40 million credit and debit card numbers and selling them to criminals in the US and Europe, in one of the largest identity theft schemes on record.</p> <p>The indictments mark the end of a three-year investigation involving law enforcement authorities from at least four countries. US attorney general Michael Mukasey said the financial toll in the case is \"impossible to quantify at this point\". </p> <p>Michael Sullivan, a justice department lawyer, said that most of the victims were in the US but officials have yet to identify all those whose credit card numbers were stolen. \"I suspect that a lot of people are unaware that their identifying information has been compromised,\" he said.</p> <p>One of the companies thought to have been targeted, TJX, is the parent of the British retail chain TK Maxx. In January, TJX admitted that information from 45.7 million credit and debit cards on both sides of the Atlantic had been stolen. Names, card numbers and personal data were stolen over a 17-month period and covering transactions dating as far back as December 2002. </p> <p>According to justice department officials and court documents, members of the ring drove close to US retail stores in search of wireless internet connections on which they installed \"sniffer\" software that would record card numbers.</p> <p>The suspects then sold the numbers over the internet to individuals who encoded them on blank credit cards and withdrew tens of thousands of dollars at a time from cash machines.</p> <p>According to court documents unsealed this week, three of the defendants, Sergey Pavlovich of Belarus, and Dzmitry Burak and Sergey Storchak of Ukraine, used a website on which credit card traffickers bought and sold data, with Pavlovich taking a percentage of the sales.</p> <p>Two other defendants, Maksym Yastremskiy of Kharkov, Ukraine, and Aleksandr Suvorov of Sillamae, Estonia, known on the internet as JonnyHell, allegedly captured credit and debit card numbers from a New York restaurant. Justice officials said Yastremskiy pocketed more than $11m from the sale of the stolen numbers.</p> <p>One of the defendants, Albert Gonzalez of Miami, was an informant for the US Secret Service, the agency tasked with protecting the US president and combating financial fraud and counterfeiting. Gonzalez faces life in prison if convicted on all charges.</p>",
  "<p>Just one thing is missing from the financial drama that has captivated us for the past year. Yes, the meltdown of the markets has been thrilling, the run on Northern Rock was spectacular, and the scalp count of chief executives is rising nicely. But where in this bonfire of capitalist certainties is the left?</p> <p>Lefties, progressives, social democrats: however wide you want to spread the net, you still won't catch any. In this debate, they've gone awol. Gordon Brown is mesmerised by his plunging poll ratings and hidebound by the orthodoxy of light-touch regulation. Labour backbenchers haven't fizzed with ideas, either. The most radical policies have instead come from a former Shell economist turned Lib Dem MP: Vince Cable. There's been barely a squeak from progressive thinktanks.</p> <p>Capitalist crisis usually spells opportunity for progressives - their moment to point out errors and suggest remedies. Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal is the famous example, but more recent is the Asian crisis of the late 90s, when the left teamed up with local activists to attack the International Monetary Fund for mishandling an entire continent. Ten years on, the IMF still hasn't recovered its authority. </p> <p>Who is diagnosing the credit crunch? Well, try whoever wrote this: \"One way of looking at the present situation would be to see it as the ultimate breakdown of that phase of western economic development known as 'financial capitalism'.\" Did it come from a venerable Marxist academic on New Left Review? No, the author is Stephen Lewis, an economist at a City firm trading derivatives. He's not the only financier doing some hard thinking. Josef Ackermann, the boss of Deutsche Bank, confesses: \"I no longer believe in the market's self-healing power.\" The former head of the US central bank, Paul Volcker, is blunter still: \"The bright new financial system, with all its talented participants, with all its rich rewards, has failed the test of the marketplace.\"</p> <p>So it's the bankers who say finance is bust. It's the capitalists who think modern capitalism is broken. All the while, progressives have been on the scent of that reddest of ideological red herrings, Britishness - or doodling \"I \u2764 Obama\" on their pencil cases. </p> <p>Why such silence on this year's biggest story? One senior think-tanker enters a plea of mitigation. His colleagues don't want to pick apart the government's economic platform: \"It wouldn't be helpful to No 10.\" In America, insurgent status has emboldened the Democrats to tackle banking reform. Over here, the one set of progressive proposals has come from the just-launched Green New Deal group (members include this paper's economics editor, Larry Elliott) rather than a bunch of old policy hands whose main currency is ministerial access.</p> <p>Not speaking up is one thing. A far bigger problem is having nothing to say. \"Perhaps the left doesn't really have a political economy any more,\" says the thinktanker, a comment echoed by many. Too few British progressives have thought in depth about what they want the economy to do, let alone how it should do it. The left's truce with the markets began as a bid for electability, but it's turned into a cosy ignorance of how markets do - and don't - work. </p> <p>That neglect didn't matter for 15 years of boom. National income grew year after year, and all the left had to do was devise clever ways of spending it. Now, however, comes the bust - and the lack of economics homework is telling. </p> <p>Take the conventional analysis of this crisis. It was imported, we're told, from Subprimesville, USA - yet the easy credit originally came from savings-stuffed Asia lending to the debtor nations of America and the UK. Then there's the chucking together of all our ills into a pot marked \"credit crunch\", when, really, three different ingredients are at work: an inevitable slowdown after years of shopping and borrowing, accelerated and exacerbated by a sudden drought of credit, and the added grit of the soaring price of oil and other raw materials. </p> <p>Labour, it's said, doesn't have the policies to get us through this mess. Wrong. This government has more policies than a forecourt has angry motorists. What it lacks is a clear sense of priorities. Does Brown want to prop up the housing market or use its slide to help those not on the property ladder? Does he want the City restored to its pre-crunch pomp or to mend its ways? Unless those questions are settled, this autumn's economic strategy will be a non-starter. </p> <p>What should a progressive economic platform look like? I'd suggest three principles. First, it must be populist, supporting people rather than mortgage lenders. Ministers should remember that bank bosses form a tiny constituency - and they aren't natural Labour voters. Second, it should concentrate on targeted interventions. Now isn't the time for new taxes, so progressives need to think harder about using market mechanisms to help the struggling. With gas bills so high, Ofgem should ensure more are put on social tariffs. Finally, leftwingers have to be more nimble.</p> <p>Some of the biggest debates on how to tame finance are already raging - among financiers. Arguments about how to curb bankers' pay have filled the back of the FT, that house journal of bankers. Why aren't the anti-inequality brigade taking on this battle? A fund manager, Avinash Persaud, has led the thinking on how to rein in banks, by making them put aside money for rainy days. His campaign should be supported by anyone who wants to correct our lopsided economy's domination by the finance sector.</p> <p>Housebuilders and banks would like nothing better than to wind the clock back to spring 2007 and start over, as if the credit crunch never happened. It's up to progressives to push a fairer alternative. As recession looms, there's enough appetite for one: this is as close as the left gets to what stockbrokers call a buying opportunity. <br><a href=\"mailto:aditya.chakrabortty@theguardian.com\"><br>aditya.chakrabortty@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>August is often an excellent month for conspiracies, but Labour's electoral meltdown and David Miliband's finely tuned bid for power have turned it into a plotters' paradise. The excitement was all supposed to have died down by now, as the contenders and their spear-carriers retired for a period of quiet holiday reflection. But instead the cabals and clans are at fever pitch, as MPs and ministers endlessly calculate the odds of a direct challenge to the prime minister next month in a blizzard of mobile and text messages across the beaches and hill towns of Europe. </p> <p>The Blairites in particular are unable to control themselves, such is their excitement at having propelled their candidate into pole position, as they smell the blood of a badly wounded prime minister. With every day bringing fresh leaks and denials - yesterday it was over claims that Miliband had already offered Alan Milburn the job of chancellor in his future administration - the Blairite insurgency is in full flood.</p> <p>Most of the media have meanwhile already cast their bloc vote for the foreign secretary. He will also be able to draw on serious cash and business backing. But it's a good deal less clear why replacing Gordon Brown with David Miliband would deliver what Labour, or the country for that matter, is actually looking for. </p> <p>Sure, he's potentially a more attractive figure than the tortured and reviled Brown, and he showed last week that he is at last shedding his gawky, policy wonk persona. Doubtless he has never drifted as far right as his one-time patron or wilder camp followers. But this is a man who was at Tony Blair's side from the start, and played a central role in the engine room of New Labour. Nothing he has said or done in government has suggested any doubts about the fundamentals of the project. </p> <p>As foreign secretary, he has continued to back the disastrous occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan and failed to end the government's humiliating deference towards the Bush administration. With the exception of his coy reference to a \"downturn made in Wall Street\", there was nothing in his Guardian piece last week to suggest Miliband recognises the need to ditch the discredited New Labour formulas of the past. On the contrary, he complained that the government hadn't kicked off its health \"reforms\" - New Labour-speak for privatisation - even earlier. His strongest supporters are almost entirely drawn from the rump of Blairite true believers. Miliband clearly represents continuity, not change.</p> <p>That was what Brown promised a year ago but has signally failed to deliver, to his and Labour's cost. There is in any case serious doubt about whether Miliband's lieutenants in parliament - who are themselves split over tactics - will be able to muster the 71 MPs needed for a contest under the party constitution. And even if they were to succeed in ousting Brown, there is as yet no obvious alternative candidate prepared to speak for the majority, in the Labour party and outside, who want to see a decisive shift of political direction.</p> <p>The leftwing Campaign Group MP John McDonnell would certainly try to stand, as might the centre-left Compass MP Jon Cruddas, in an effort to widen the policy debate. Within the cabinet, from where any credible challenge would have to come, the health secretary Alan Johnson would probably be in the strongest position to defeat Miliband, with a backstory as a postal worker that would certainly puncture the confected everyman image of the Tory leader David Cameron. But he would have to work hard to dump his own Blairite baggage and has yet to show his hand. </p> <p>Meanwhile, dozens of Labour MPs who stand to lose their seats in the early election that they fear would be forced on any new Labour leader reckon a better bet would be to hold on to Brown, let him absorb the flak for problems he helped to create as recession bites deeper - and dump him if necessary next autumn, when they hope the economy might be about to pick up.</p> <p>What neither Brown nor his rivals seem yet to have grasped is the scale of political change needed to deal with the new conditions triggered by global financial crisis, falling living standards and recession - and the bankruptcy of a deregulated market model all the rage during a boom that has now evaporated. </p> <p>Last week, the conservative Wall Street Journal reported on the \"new wave of government regulation of business and the economy\" and \"backlash against laissez-faire\" sweeping the US in the wake of the credit crunch. But in Britain, a deeply embattled Brown is said to be still resisting the kind of popular radical measures against rampant corporate power, such as a windfall tax on the oil companies, that even some Blairites privately support. </p> <p>Brown has a choice. He could face down the threat of a counter-coup and relaunch his premiership next month by breaking with untrammelled neoliberalism and making the move beyond Blairism he ducked last summer. He could announce an emergency package of measures that would tilt government policy unambiguously towards greater equality and public intervention - such as controls on utility prices, a shift of the tax burden from the low-paid to the rich, and a major public housing programme. He could make a conference speech that reminded voters of what Labour is supposed to stand for and carry out a reshuffle reflecting the new approach: cutting the disproportionate Blairite presence down to size - the corporate-fawning business secretary John Hutton would be a popular victim - and bringing in left-leaning MPs like Cruddas and Jon Trickett.</p> <p>Alternatively, he can stagger on like John Major as a shadow prime minister and prisoner of his predecessor's partisans, timidly triangulating until he or his government finally crashes and burns. Both his record and his character - and the leaks from No 10 - suggest the latter is more likely. As one prominent New Labour figure put it to me yesterday: \"Gordon doesn't like to pick fights and this is a time when you've got to be prepared to pick fights.\"</p> <p>Either way, the challenge for the rest of the party has to be to crystallise what is already a clear majority for a more progressive and popular policy agenda: on pensions, health, housing, tax, regulation and Iraq. With or without Brown, Labour has to take a new political direction to survive. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:s.milne@theguardian.com\">s.milne@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>In a year when the self-confidence of British Flat racing seems at an all-time low, when our best races go unsponsored and are routinely picked off by foreign raiders, it seems entirely appropriate that Papal Bull should be revealed as the best horse in the country. The five-year-old, who has won two of his last 11 races, was handed that honour yesterday by Timeform, but their bouquet came with a matching brickbat, as it was emphasised that the horse's character remains under suspicion.</p> <p>To the disgust of his owners, Papal Bull has long been tagged with the famous Timeform 'squiggle', meaning he is regarded as unreliable by that respected organisation. Of the many horses to have borne that stigma, he is now the highest-rated for more than half a century.</p> <p>On a mark of 132, up from 121 a month ago, Papal Bull is joint-third in Timeform's brand new global rankings, an innovation designed to assist in the development of a narrative for the Flat season. He is one point behind Duke Of Marmalade, who recently outbattled him in the King George at Ascot, while the ratings are topped by the American champion, Curlin.</p> <p>David Stack, spokesman for the syndicate that owns Papal Bull, disputed Timeform's assessment that his horse is a \"difficult ride\" and \"often looks moody\". \"He just enjoys showing himself off,\" said Stack, who feels that back pain was sometimes to blame when the horse appeared unenthusiastic last year.</p> <p>Timeform's Kieran Packman said that, because of Papal Bull's high profile, there had been a long discussion about whether the squiggle was justified. \"We remain to be convinced and we'll watch his next couple of starts with interest,\" he added.</p> <p>According to Stack, the next target is a race in Germany a week on Sunday before Papal Bull is aimed at the Arc de Triomphe and the Japan Cup. He will then be retired to stud, meaning British racegoers have almost certainly had their last chance to see the best horse around. \"We've had a lot of interest from the owners of a lot of high-class mares,\" said Stack, happily.</p> <p>Aidan O'Brien may only have the second-best horse in the world at his Ballydoyle yard but he already dominates the betting for next year's Classics. </p> <p>His Masterofthehorse and Black Bear Island were yesterday cut by Ladbrokes to 20-1 for the 2009 Derby, from 40-1 and 33-1 respectively, after both were impressive winners in Ireland earlier this week. They share favouritism with O'Brien's Rip Van Winkle, who is also second-favourite for the 2,000 Guineas, behind only his stablemate Mastercraftsman.</p> <h2>Ron Cox's tip of the day</h2> <p><strong>Bonne </strong>3.10 Haydock</p> <p>The best is yet to be seen of Michael Bell's filly, a clear-cut winner at Nottingham before finishing third under an inexperienced apprentice rider at Thirsk last week. Slowly away, Bonne was switched left to make her challenge away from the main action on the stands' side and was unable to land a blow against The History Man. Suited by some cut in the ground, she can resume winning ways.</p>",

  "<p>Hell hath no fury like a bride scorned. Or so it seemed yesterday afternoon when 20 brides and a smattering of grooms marched on the headquarters of HSBC in London to demand their missing wedding presents. </p> <p>The incongruous protest amid the gleaming office towers of Canary Wharf came 48 hours after the collapse of Wrapit, an internet wedding list company which had promised \"the ultimate wedding service\" but went into administration on Monday with gifts worth \u00a33.5m undelivered.</p> <p>The message from protesters was clear: we want our Le Creuset sets, dinner services and tea towels and we want them now, or at the very least, a prompt refund. Attired in wedding dresses, veils and sparkling crystal tiaras, and carrying, in one instance, a symbolically empty Wrapit box, they represented about 4,000 newlyweds experiencing an unwelcome financial jilting.</p> <p>With almost all of Wrapit's staff laid off and KPMG installed as administrators of the Wandsworth-based firm, the couples vented their anger at the bank and picked Sarah Roberts, a 25-year-old bride sporting a satin dress and white veil, to deliver a 950-signature petition calling on HSBC to help arrange the delivery of those missing gifts or at least pay back their wedding guests, 100,000 of whom have been affected. HSBC, Wrapit's bank, had withdrawn its credit card processing facility.</p> <p>\"I have been surprised at how emotional I feel about this,\" said Sally Fraser, 34, a recruitment consultancy director who married in June and said she stands to lose her entire \u00a34,500 wedding list. \"It's not about the gifts its about the memories. These would have been lifelong purchases that would have reminded us of our friends and family. My mum and her partner got me a Le Creuset roasting pot ... I would have thought of her when I used it. I said to my husband I feel like we've been robbed; that someone has come into our house and burgled us.\"</p> <p>Michael O'Sullivan, 33, the organiser, sporting his wedding kilt, sporran and dirk, said the problems were like \"an indelible blemish\" on what should have been a \"magical experience\". </p> <p>\"I know it would be cheaper for HSBC to pay for our presents rather than arrange refunds,\" he said. </p> <p>Law student Gabriela Breza, 29, who married Kevin Krist last year, has lost \u00a37,000 of gifts. \"People who are questioning the march seem to think we are just a group of rich people marching for our expensive gifts, but for many a wedding list is a way of starting up a home.\"</p> <p>The couples appear to have been spurred on by Wrapit's ex-managing director, Peter Gelardi. He wrote to customers proposing HSBC should fund Wrapit to deliver all the outstanding gifts and urged the couples to lobby the bank's executives. In an email to customers, he wrote: \"When big banks change policies, little companies sometimes get squashed.\"</p> <p>HSBC has said it does not believe delivering the gifts \"appropriate or practical\" and pointed out the firm's long-held problems. Wrapit traded for eight years and made an operating loss for every year it filed accounts, totalling just over \u00a33m. Wrapit is the third company in which Gelardi, 62, has held a directorship that has been taken into the control of administrative receivers. World Telecom, which sold pre-paid phone cards and mobile phones, went into receivership in 2000 despite Gelardi's efforts. From 1997-1999 he was also director of Global Numbers Ltd which provided personal telephone numbers but the receivers were called in by 2000.</p> <p>Yesterday, Gelardi floated another idea: each couple could receive a voucher from Debenhams or Liberty for the value of their outstanding wedding presents. He said he had secured Debenhams' involvement, was waiting for Liberty to respond, and that KMPG had promised to consider the plan. But for the couples it seemed a distant hope.</p> <p>Sarah Ellis, 29, a teacher of deaf primary school children from Harrow, said she was most worried about her guests, almost all of whom paid for gifts by debit card which means they must apply to become creditors of the stricken company to have any hope of getting their money back.</p> <p>\"My mother-in-law died recently and she had bought us a \u00a3200 cutlery set which we are never going to get now,\" she said. \"We haven't got a penny out of this and we haven't got any gifts.\"</p>",
  "<p>Four NHS hospitals and a university last night disclosed plans for a \u00a32bn business partnership to create the largest biomedical research organisation in Europe.</p> <p>The venture - to be called UCL Partners - seeks to establish London as an intellectual powerhouse for the invention of new drugs and treatments. It is being set up by University College London, its sister hospital UCLH, Great Ormond Street hospital for children, Moorfields eye hospital and the Royal Free Hampstead.</p> <p>The five organisations have a combined turnover of about \u00a32bn. They treat more than 1.5 million patients a year and employ more than 3,500 scientists, senior researchers and consultants. In a statement last night, the partners said: \"By pooling resources and expertise we will be able to produce more world-class research in key areas, including cancer and heart disease, and deliver the benefits more rapidly to patients.\" </p> <p>The move followed a recommendation from Lord Darzi, the health minister, for the creation of academic health science centres to speed the transmission of new ideas from the laboratory bench to the hospital ward.</p> <p>There was widespread concern in the medical establishment that Britain would not be able to compete in a global research market without stronger collaboration between academic institutions and healthcare providers. The competition includes long-established partnerships between universities and hospitals in the US, which demonstrated how patients' health could benefit if doctors had access to the latest scientific innovations. The 16 hospitals that came at the top of medical league tables in 2005 were all academic health science partnerships.</p> <p>The UCL partnership will become operational next month, focusing initially on 10 areas of research in which London can aspire to world-class expertise. The priorities will be the nervous system, children's health, heart disease, transplantation, immunology, ophthalmology, deafness and hearing impairment, dental and oral disease, cancer and women's health.</p> <p>Malcolm Grant, president and provost of UCL, said: \"We have chosen to concentrate on these areas because in all of them we are already leading the way in the UK or Europe. Our goal is to build on that reputation and become genuinely world-class in as many of those areas as possible.\" Moorfields and UCL's institute for ophthalmology are developing a revolutionary gene therapy treatment for inherited blindness.</p> <p>Neil Goodwin, the partnership's project director, said: \"This is about London positioning itself internationally. Other research centres are emerging in Dubai, Singapore and Shanghai. They have superlative research facilities and large catchment areas of patients, which is attractive to pharmaceutical companies conducting clinical trials.\"</p>",
  "<p>Several readers have complained that Michael Billington (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/aug/06/theatre.rsc\">From Time Lord to antic prince: David Tennant is the best Hamlet in years, page 3, yesterday</a>) quoted the prince's opening soliloquy as saying: \"O that this too too sullied flesh would melt.\" \"Sullied\", they objected, should have been \"solid\". In fact there are three respected versions of this text. In the first quarto: \"O that this too much grieu'd and sallied flesh / Would melt to nothing\"; In the second quarto: \"O that this too too sallied flesh would melt, / Thaw and resolue itselfe into a dewe,\"; and in the first folio: \"Oh that this too too solid Flesh, would melt, / Thaw, and resolue it self into a Dew\". \"Sallied\" nowadays is usually given as \"sullied\". No version is more decisively authentic than the others. Michael Billington could not discern which one Tennant was using.</p> <p>The version of Tracy Chevalier's novel Girl With a Pearl Earring to be staged at Cambridge next month (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/jul/30/art.theatre\">Vermeer gets the theatre treatment</a>, Arts Diary, page 29, G2, July 30) has been adapted by David Joss Buckley, not by Shelagh Stevenson.</p> <p>Our obituary of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/04/nobelprize.russia2\">Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn</a> (page 30, August 5), said that after the mid-1960s his works were never published while the Soviet regime remained in power. In fact in the perestroika period several were published, including The Gulag Archipelago.</p> <p>Two Liberal Democrats and one Conservative opposed the report of the Commons environmental committee (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/04/travelandtransport.greenpolitics\">Panel of MPs backs green car tax</a>, page 6, August 4), not one Lib Dem and two Conservatives.</p>",
  "<p>The UK should take active steps to prepare for dangerous climate change of perhaps 4C according to one of the government's chief scientific advisers. </p> <p>In policy areas such as flood protection, agriculture and coastal erosion Professor Bob Watson said the country should plan for the effects of a 4C global average rise on pre-industrial levels. The EU is committed to limiting emissions globally so that temperatures do not rise more than 2C.</p> <p>\"There is no doubt that we should aim to limit changes in the global mean surface temperature to 2C above pre-industrial,\" Watson, the chief scientific adviser to the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, told the Guardian. \"But given this is an ambitious target, and we don't know in detail how to limit greenhouse gas emissions to realise a 2 degree target, we should be prepared to adapt to 4C.\" </p> <p>Globally, a 4C temperature rise would have a catastrophic impact. </p> <p>According to the government's 2006 Stern review on the economics of climate change, between 7 million and 300 million more people would be affected by coastal flooding each year, there would be a 30-50% reduction in water availability in Southern Africa and the Mediterranean, agricultural yields would decline 15 to 35% in Africa and 20 to 50% of animal and plant species would face extinction.</p> <p>In the UK, the most significant impact would be rising sea levels and inland flooding. Climate modellers also predict there would be an increase in heavy rainfall events in winter and drier summers. </p> <p>Watson's plea to prepare for the worst was backed up by the government's former chief scientific adviser, Sir David King. He said that even with a comprehensive global deal to keep carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere at below 450 parts per million there is a 50% probability that temperatures would exceed 2C and a 20% probability they would exceed 3.5C. </p> <p>\"So even if we get the best possible global agreement to reduce greenhouse gasses on any rational basis you should be preparing for a 20% risk so I think Bob Watson is quite right to put up the figure of 4 degrees,\" he said.</p> <p>One big unknown is the stage at which dangerous tipping points would be reached that lead to further warming - for example the release of methane hydrate deposits in the Arctic. \"My own feeling is that if we get to a 4 degree rise it is quite possible that we would begin to see a runaway increase,\" said King.</p> <p>He said a two-and-half-year analysis by the government's Foresight programme on the implications for coastal defences had more impact in the corridors of power than any other research on the effects of climate change that he presented. </p> <p>\"No other single factor focussed the minds of the cabinet more than the analysis that I produced through that ... We begin to have to talk about ordered retreat from some areas of Britain because it becomes impossible to defend,\" he said. \"There's no choice here between adaptation and mitigation, we have to do both.\"</p> <p>Other experts were concerned that Watson's comments might be seen as defeatist and an admission that emissions reductions were impossible to achieve. </p> <p>\"At 4 degrees we are basically into a different climate regime,\" said Prof Neil Adger, an expert on adaptation to climate change at the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research in Norwich. </p> <p>\"I think that is a dangerous mindset to be in. Thinking through the implications of 4 degrees of warming shows that the impacts are so significant that the only real adaptation strategy is to avoid that at all cost because of the pain and suffering that is going to cost.</p> <p>\"There is no science on how we are going to adapt to 4 degrees warming. It is actually pretty alarming,\" he added.</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian, Watson, who is a former science adviser to President Clinton and ex-chief scientist at the World Bank, said the UK should take a lead in research on carbon capture and storage (CCS). </p> <p>Alluding to the US effort in the 1960s to put a man on the moon he advocated an \"Apollo-type programme\" to introduce 10 to 20 CCS pilot projects - which work by burying carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels underground - among OECD countries to develop the technology. </p> <p>\"This would allow coal-fired power plants that are currently being built to be modular and capable of having carbon capture retrofitted, and would show the world that we take the issue of climate change seriously, thus demonstrating real leadership. Without this technology we have a real problem.\"</p> <p>He also said as coal burning is cleaned up to remove harmful sulphur pollution climate change would actually get worse. The sulphur aerosols are actually preventing some warming from taking place currently. </p> <p>\"This offsetting effect, which is equivalent to about 100 parts per million of carbon dioxide, will largely disappear if China and India follow the lead of the US and Europe in limiting sulphur emissions, the cause of acid deposition,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The One Show has been a surprise success.</strong></p> <p>I wasn't there at the beginning, but there was definitely a snobby element then - lots of people distanced themselves from the show, saying it was going to be a massive flop. But ultimately the very people saying that are the ones calling us to try to get on the show. It's swings and round-abouts, isn't it? You shouldn't be snobby on TV.</p> <p><strong>The show has been described as being patronising, a sort of TV Prozac for the nation.</strong></p> <p>Is that a bad thing? Maybe it's not. I have now become a seven-minute expert on everything: I'll know seven minutes' worth of information about badgers, frogs, the current state of tourism in Cornwall - it varies from day to day. We sit back every so often and think, \"I can't believe we're part of this.\" It's changed early- evening viewing on BBC1 to such an extent.</p> <p><strong>You have a politics degree and a good track record in television in Belfast, but when you came to the show you were seen by some as the \"beauty\" to co-presenter Adrian Chiles's \"brains\". That must have been annoying.</strong></p> <p>I shocked a lot of the team because in the studio environment I knew more than Adrian did, and that was a massive tool for me. I was able to rein him in and suddenly he realised, \"Actually she does know what she's taking about - she's not just going to sit and smile.\"</p> <p><strong>In one interview, Adrian said he first thought you were a \"dippy, nice-looking bird from Northern Ireland\" and you described him as a \"miserable fart\".</strong></p> <p>I definitely said \"miserable fart\" but he claims not to have said that. But who knows?</p> <p><strong>Does it sound like something he would say?</strong></p> <p>Possibly, yeah. I think I just bombarded him with friendly chat, and I guess I was coming from this position that if it didn't work out I was going back home again. If I came across as relaxed and dippy, fair enough - that's just me.</p> <p><strong>Are you really that enthusiastic in real life?</strong></p> <p>I think I am. Partly because I came to London to do this, on a temporary basis, not knowing one single person, and now here I am doing one of the biggest shows that has hit the BBC for years. That's a lot to take in, and I never ever take it for granted. I've done all the horrible jobs - I've made the tea, I've run after people, I've been at their beck and call - and I appreciate what the sound man has to do, I appreciate what the little runner has to do to keep everybody happy, because I've gone through the ranks. We [the presenters] get the glory of it all because we happen to be on camera, but really it's not about us - there are another 50 people behind it, and it wouldn't happen without them. I sit every night and think, \"This is incredible.\" That's where the enthusiasm comes from. It's genuinely genuine. </p> <p>I still have to pinch myself.</p> <p><strong>Much has been made of the chemistry between you and Adrian on set. Is that the success of the show?</strong></p> <p>It has to be part of it. On TV you either get slated for not having any chemistry or told off for having too much. You have to get along simply because you spend a lot of time with people. Chemistry makes it sound a little more sordid than it is, but you can be mates. We're a big sociable crowd. It's not just Adrian - the chemistry is there with our entire team. </p> <p><strong>How do you feel about the rumours about you and Adrian?</strong></p> <p>I just giggle about them - we both do. It's almost like people want it to be true. I wonder: do [This Morning presenters] Fern and Philip get this? They probably did at the beginning. It's given me a different insight into how things work over here. I guess Northern Ireland is such a small place that this would never happen because everybody knows everybody. I suppose people don't know enough about me, they don't know my background, they don't know if I'm married with kids because I've never really gone down the press route.

  "<p>George Monbiot's article on coal and energy (The stakes could not be higher. Everything hinges on stopping coal, August 5) is misleading.</p> <p>Monbiot is right that energy policy must be shaped to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. It must also respond to growing energy needs (although these growing needs must also be checked through greater energy efficiency). Over the next 25 to 50 years, because of cost and availability, coal is expected to meet much of the rising global demand for energy. If unabated, the carbon dioxide emissions would pose unacceptable climate risks.</p> <p>Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is an unproven technology on the scale required for coal-fired power plants, but the various elements of the technology have been proven to work on a smaller scale. What is required is a concerted effort by all major nations to translate this into commercial operation. It seems ridiculous to have to remind people that all technologies are unproven until they are proven. People said electricity could not work on a commercial scale.</p> <p>Coal can play a part in the energy mix for the UK, but consent must be given to new coal-fired power stations only on condition that operating permits are withdrawn if they fail to capture 90% of their carbon dioxide emissions by 2020. This will send a clear signal to develop a technology that can play a major part in helping to meet UK and global energy needs without risking dangerous climate change.<br><strong>Martin Rees</strong><br>President, Royal Society</p> <p>George Monbiot is absolutely right to stress the urgent need to curb carbon emissions, and the risks to global economic and humanitarian development if we fail. We agree that a big expansion of renewables and new nuclear is needed. And Monbiot is also right to question whether a carbon trading scheme alone will kick-start the deployment of CCS technology. But his main point - that building Kingsnorth power station without CCS will make it impossible to tackle climate change - is where the argument falls down. In particular, he seems to misunderstand the role of the EU emissions trading scheme. Generating a price for carbon is only half of what the scheme does. Equally importantly, it sets a legally binding cap on total emissions from the EU's power and industrial sectors.</p> <p>The CBI has backed a cap which declines year by year, and is linked directly to the EU's emissions targets. Everything does not \"hinge on stopping coal\" because whether or not Kingsnorth is built, the UK and EU energy sectors will still have to meet the EU carbon cap. <br><strong>Dr Neil Bentley</strong><br>Director of business environment, CBI</p> <p>Shame on you, George. You are selling out to the nuclear lobby. Indulging in the \"niceties of liberal debate\" shows profound ignorance of the power struggles being waged, and how your influence will now be turned against any radical green agenda. </p> <p>The nuclear option is a betrayal of future generations: it is unsafe, undesirable and unaffordable. With enough dynamic leadership we can power up from renewables.</p> <p>The nuclear argument simply wants more of the same - more economic growth, more junk-producing retail capitalism, more motorways, more landfill sites, more social and spiritual alienation from urban poverty and meaningless work, and more personal depression. We are poised at a major crossroads in the history of our civilisation. Now is our opportunity to call for fundamental change - for a new society with new values based on caring and sharing, not exploitation and greed. </p> <p>Our only real option lies with a new generation of young people who are tired of the consensus. Many of them will be found at Kingsnorth power station this weekend. They are disenchanted with the Browns and the Camerons, and all their hollow rhetoric.<br><strong>Kevin Riley</strong><br>Selby, North Yorkshire</p> <p>George Monbiot's reluctant acceptance that we may need nuclear power illustrates that if we are to avert catastrophic climate change then we must to an extent accept the world we have, not imagine the one we would like. Hardline greens are right to claim that the best solution is for all of us to use less energy more efficiently. However, only a fool reacts to such a colossal threat by saying that only the most palatable solution can be accepted, even if it probably won't work on its own. Just as a horrible war was necessary to stop the Nazis, so nuclear power may be necessary to avert runaway climate change.<br><strong>Dr Richard Milne</strong><br>University of Edinburgh</p> <p>It might just be possible, but not necessarily desirable, for Britain to have a carbon-free energy strategy based entirely on renewables and nuclear, as George Monbiot suggests. But without the use of CCS, how will carbon dioxide emissions be reduced in China, which relies upon coal for 80% of its electricity and is building power stations at the rate of 1 gigawatt a week?<br><strong>Chris Davies MEP</strong><br>Liberal Democrat, North West England</p> <p>Could it be that Professor France is unable to comprehend the modern world, steeped as he is in the minutiae of the medieval one, or is it just that there are no medieval sources available on 21st-century climate change (Letters, August 4)? The 1970s \"global cooling\" story came out of a misunderstanding by Newsweek magazine of scientific debate on the relative strength of heating/cooling effects in the atmosphere. As for the ozone hole being '\"out of fashion\" could that just be because the world reduced the use of CFCs, the largest single man-made destroyer of ozone? Presumably the professor was busy in Byzantium while the Montreal protocol was being signed by 43 nations in 1987.<br><strong>Alan Calder</strong><br>Milton Keynes</p>",
  "<p>On the surface, Barack Obama's appearance on NBC's <strong>Meet the Press</strong> was pure American television: the Democratic challenger quizzed at length by Tom Brokaw, the stateside David Dimbleby. And yet, at another level, it was unexpectedly British. Because the programme was taped on the Saturday afternoon that the senator was in London during his European swing, viewers saw, behind Brokaw and Obama, through the vast glass frontage of the swanky premises NBC used, a shimmering digital watercolour of Big Ben and the Thames. People tuning in late might have wondered if the politician was campaigning to run the UK as well. </p> <p>And yet what this anglicised American broadcast represented above all was the still dizzyingly new phenomenon of global broadcasting: I watched the whole edition of Meet the Press on a laptop in London. </p> <p>For political obsessives, this is television heaven: even as recently as the 2004 race, we would have had to fly to the US to view such an interview in full. This new international access, multiplied through video-sharing sites, is one reason that Obama has achieved an unprecedented level of celebrity.</p> <p>But, like many utopian dreams, this one is threatened by brutal economics. The edition I watched carried US adverts, but the corporations get no return for their bucks from me. In the same way, an American viewer watching Jeremy Paxman interview David Cameron is able to do so without paying the licence fee and, increasingly, British viewers of web television will also escape payment. Though optimists fantasise about the possibilities of subscription, every show watched outside its intended transmission area is another blow for the basis on which UK public service television is funded. </p> <p>And so this is the pit beneath the new omniscience that the web has given viewers. The fact that I can sit in London and watch the interrogation of would-be presidents for free reduces the chances that, in a decade's time, we'll be able to watch long, in-depth interviews with our own leaders.</p>",
  "<p>The global airline industry will fly 60m fewer seats in the run-up to Christmas - equivalent to a 7% cut in flights - as high oil prices and the economic downturn force carriers to cut services.</p> <p>Experts predict even deeper cuts in 2009 as part of a prolonged retrenchment of an industry that has expanded rapidly in recent years. Airlines will offer 59.7m fewer seats between October and December compared with the same period last year, according to flight information company OAG. Britain's biggest carriers have already confirmed significant capacity cuts, with Ryanair, easyJet and British Airways all reducing services.</p> <p>Chris Tarry, a leading industry consultant, said the worldwide cuts, led by US carriers including Continental and American Airlines, will be followed by further reductions next year as airlines pay the price for expanding their fleets by nearly 1,700 aircraft since 2005. According to Boeing, the global commercial airline fleet stood at 19,000 planes at the end of last year. \"As we move into the later part of this year, airlines are taking a view on just how difficult the market is going to be. I don't think we have seen all the likely capacity adjustments at this stage. For airlines, 2009 is going to be even more difficult than 2008,\" said Tarry.</p> <p>OAG echoed comments by BA chief executive Willie Walsh last week that the airline industry faced its \"worst ever\" trading environment. Steve Casley, OAG's chief operating officer, said: \"From our statistics, it looks quite possible that we may be facing a far more severe global downturn than we have experienced before.\"</p> <p>He added that routes will be cut at 275 airports around the world in the final quarter of the year. BA has dropped six European short-haul routes from Gatwick, while Ryanair has also dropped a number of destinations in Croatia and France from its Stansted schedules. A third of the global capacity cuts are taking place in the US domestic market, but the transatlantic market is moving in the opposite direction with a 1% increase in seats owing to the Open Skies treaty that has liberalised air travel between the US and Europe.</p> <p>The Asian market, one of the brightest performers, is making a 13% reduction in flights. The capacity decline is even worse than the reduction that followed the September 11 terror attacks, when the number of seats flown fell by 5%.</p>",
  "<p>Your leader column points out that \"the big six utility firms nearly always raise prices in lockstep\" (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/29/householdbills.energy\">Up, up and away</a>, July 28). You say that this shows a \"market that is not running smoothly, but creaking\". </p> <p>Quite the opposite is true. All the utility companies have opportunity to buy gas on the same virtual dealing floors. They buy at similar times, and when the market price rises then all the customers have to pay more. The market is working; the problem is a lack of gas supply.</p> <p>You ask: \"Why is gas tied to the price of oil, when the two are separate markets?\" The price of oil is linked to gas in a number of ways. Many industries can switch from gas to oil and back at the flick of a switch, which is essential for the cheapest \"interruptible\" gas supply contracts. Gas and oil are discovered and exploited together and decline together - UK oil extraction peaked in 1999, gas peaked in 2000. </p> <p>UK oil exports have collapsed to zero in eight years, helping to push up global oil prices. At the same time we have started to import gas, just as international competition takes off. That same international competition is driving up coal prices too. </p> <p>Britain is, as you say, \"a country that still sources 70% of its gas at home\". But that figure is declining at an accelerating rate, now falling 10% per year, and by 2020 80% of our domestic gas production will be gone (government and industry agree on this). </p> <p>While there may be enough pipes and terminals in place for imports, it is very unlikely that there will be enough gas at affordable prices to fill them all. Of the 25 countries in the EU, 23 are gas importers; so competition will be fierce, and gas prices will rise for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>What to do should government, as you suggest, \"give the energy watchdog, Ofgem, a kick up the rear\"? Ofgem is set up to ensure a free market, nothing more. It would need new powers and specific instructions to help those now suffering fuel poverty. I would support the idea of a survival tariff, with which a basic ration of fuel is cheap, and above that ration users pay a higher price that encourages efficiency. Any attempt to subsidise domestic fuel must recognise that imported fuel will be at a price set in a ruthlessly functional global market.</p> <p>Neither an inquiry by MPs nor kicking Ofgem will sort things out. There is simply not enough to go around, and consumers will have to use less fuel. There are vast reserves of oil and gas, but we have used up the best stuff and what is left is slow and expensive to extract. This is \"peak oil\". The price rises we see today are a warning that fossil fuel extraction cannot happen fast enough to support economic growth. And though the coming recession will cut demand, this will be to the benefit of the climate, rather than consumers.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Max Oakes is a member of the Institution of Gas Engineers and is coordinator of the Depletion Scotland group, which aims to raise awareness of the peak oil issue <br><a href=\"mailto:max.oakes@depletion-scotland.org.uk\">max.oakes@depletion-scotland.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<h2>Dirty electricity</h2> <p>Electricity is a highly polluting form of energy. It is clean at the point of use (which is why you, Panorama and lots of other people presumably think it is environmentally friendly) but mostly it is generated using fossil fuels - and this is the problem (What is going to power our cars, July 31). Somewhere, typically miles away from the user, is a power station belching out CO2 and NOx. Typically, electricity is no more than 20% efficient because of losses in the power station and distribution losses so 80% is wasted.

  "<p>Just like blades, phrases can be blunted by overuse. Talk of avoiding \"catastrophic climate change\" is so familiar, the words no longer instantly stir up apocalyptic images. But in the light of remarks from Defra's chief scientific adviser, it is worth recalling what would be involved. As the Guardian reports today, Professor Bob Watson says Britain must prepare for an increase in temperatures of 4C - a rise deep in catastrophe territory. Even at 3C between a fifth and a half of all species would face extinction. At 4C some human populations could be heading the same way. Swaths of Africa and the Mediterranean would be parched of water and see food production decimated. Over the decades, melting polar ice sheets would increase sea levels to the point where whole island nations - not to mention parts of Britain - would be smothered. The release of CO2 could spiral beyond human control if the heat stopped natural forest fires from burning themselves out. In the darkest scenario, civilisation would be on the slipway to oblivion.</p> <p>Mercifully, that is far from certain - but with warming in excess of 2C very little is. Is Prof Watson encouraging fatalistic acceptance of it? Emphatically not. His responsibilities include advising not just on climate policy, but also flood defences. And the only responsible way to plan coastal barriers is on the basis of an honest appraisal of what the future could bring - however depressing that may be. In line with the Stern report and the IPCC, Prof Watson believes all governments should seek to contain global warming to 2C. He merely acknowledges that the chance that this target will not be met is too real to be ignored.</p> <p>That is putting it mildly. Even if global emissions could be stabilised at current levels, a rise in excess of 2C would be a substantial possibility. Indeed it might become a probability if China and India follow the west and clean up their industry to tackle acid rain. (The sulphurous gases which cause that problem also offset global warming by reflecting sunlight.) Instead of stabilising, however, emissions continue to rise, and the political obstacles on turning the tide remain formidable. The passing of George W Bush next year will remove only one of several. The US is now so far above Kyoto baselines, that even when a more constructive president takes over - as either candidate would prove - they may demand a deal that takes account of this catastrophic starting point. But other countries who have been working to cut emissions might resist this as a reward for failure. There will be other sticking points, too. China is now the world's biggest emitter, so no meaningful deal can exclude it. But there is scope for argument about whether galloping emissions from the workshop of the world are the responsibility of the Chinese producers or the western consumers they serve. A recent report by the Stockholm Environment Institute has underlined this point.</p> <p>The Stern report established that - from the point of view of the global economy - prevention is cheaper than cure. For individual countries, however, who consider the calculus in isolation, the balance will often be reversed. After all, even with a sizable economy such as Britain, whatever sacrifices are made to cut emissions the direct effect on the global emissions - and thus the climate - will be marginal, and self-interest starts to dictate a strategy of mitigating catastrophe instead. </p> <p>Prof Watson acknowledges this miserable - yet hard - logic by suggesting preparations be set in train for a rise of up to 4C. But he rightly argues that rich countries can still recast the logic through coordinated action. A joint agreement to find a way of making carbon capture work, and to fund it, would be a first step. Every country could argue that the vast funds involved are unaffordable. Each, however, is one part of the same planet - and it can no longer afford delay.</p>",

It has also coincided with an increasingly bold Taliban insurgency against Nato forces in Afghanistan, which has sparked talk of a new American troop \"surge\" endorsed by both Barack Obama and John McCain.</p> <p>But an increase in overwhelming force \u2013 which has already been tried by Pakistani president, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4797762.stm\">Pervez Musharraf</a> multiple times to no avail \u2013 is unlikely to work unless the US and its allies gain a better understanding the tribal areas in which they are so intimately engaged.</p> <p>Pakistan's tribal areas are populated mainly by <a href=\"http://www.sptimes.com/News/102801/Worldandnation/For_Pakistan_s_Pashtu.shtml\">Pashtuns</a>, an ethnic group that also extends into Afghanistan.</p> <p>Constant warfare in recent years has led many Pashtuns to believe they are fighting a tribal war to preserve their way of life. They feel threatened by the Pakistani government and military, composed mainly of urban ethnic Punjabis; the government in Afghanistan, composed mainly of Tajiks, Uzbeks, and Hazaras; as well as by the US. Although the Afghan president, <a href=\"http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/story.aspx?id=NEWEN20080060210&amp;ch=8/5/2008%207:46:00%20PM\">Hamid Karzai</a>, is a Pashtun he is perceived by many fellow tribesmen to have \"sold out\".</p> <p>Because the Pashtun tribes are Muslim, they feel Islam is under attack and seek to defend it. Clerics have even denied Islamic burial for Punjabi soldiers on the grounds that they are not Muslim.</p> <p>The larger war many Pashtun tribesmen are fighting to defend Islam against the perceived attacks of the US, the west, Hindu-dominated India, and the forces of globalisation, has its roots in this tribal micro-conflict and the one cannot be seen in isolation from the other. In this charged environment any apparent attack on Islam, be it from US drones or Danish cartoons, adds fuel to the fire.</p> <p>The ISI also counts many Pashtuns in its ranks \u2013 especially at its lower levels \u2013 for whom this tribal identity takes centre stage. The organisation has been structured since its founding in 1948 to fight Pakistan's traditional arch-rival, India. Many ISI operatives would sympathise with the Pashtun tribesmen who share their culture \u2013 which include actively opposing India for its policy in Kashmir, for example \u2013 regardless of the policies of their superiors in Islamabad.</p> <p>The US has suffered as a result of a confusing labelling of the enemy \u2013 the line between Pashtun tribesmen, Taliban, and al-Qaida remains dangerously ill-defined.</p> <p>To improve the situation, the US can take several immediate steps. First, it should work with the Pakistani government to reinstate the civil service in the tribal areas, which was removed by President Musharraf. This created a power vacuum which was filled by firebrand Taliban clerics.</p> <p>The US should also support gestures of dialogue with the tribes made by the new democratically-elected Pakistani civilian government instead of actively opposing them.</p> <p>This does not mean \"appeasing\" those that would attack America but administering more effectively. By combining the threat of force with efforts to gain the respect of the tribes by working within their cultural and religious framework, the US can swing the pendulum away from Taliban clerics who preach that Islam is under attack from the west. It can also put more American aid into education and development and away from unnecessary military expenditure which has cost the US more than $10bn since 9/11. </p> <p>This would also improve Pakistan's relationship with India by allowing the Pakistani government to continue its policy of engagement without the distraction of Pashtun tribesmen who wish to continue their fight. The calmer the situation becomes in the tribal areas, the calmer the situation will be in places that concern India, like Kashmir, and the less likely it will be that Pashtun elements in the ISI stir up trouble.</p> <p>If the US does not change course quickly, it will continue the global march toward disaster that has seen it get bogged down in other Muslim tribal societies such as Iraq and Somalia. Instead of going after only those in Pakistan's tribal areas who wished America harm, it has taken on the fierce Pashtun tribes which have successfully bled such empires as the British and Soviet. By implementing smart, effective, culturally sensitive policies, the US can avoid a similar fate.</p>",
  "<p>A panel of top Wall Street bankers has recommended cigarette-style health warnings on complex financial instruments and has suggested that ill-considered bonus packages may be encouraging financiers to take excessive risks.</p> <p>In a 176-page report on the credit crunch, an industry-wide group of senior financial executives has called for a raft of changes to disclosure, governance and stress testing at banks, together with restrictions on the sale of certain potentially toxic derivatives.</p> <p>Chaired by a Goldman Sachs managing director, Gerald Corrigan, the group blames age-old human foibles for the global financial crisis \u2013 but adds that distorted pay structures may have contributed by encouraging gung-ho behaviour.</p> <p>\"The root cause of financial market excesses on both the upside and the downside of the cycle is collective human behaviour \u2013 unbridled optimism on the upside and fear \u2013 bordering on panic \u2013 on the downside,\" it says. </p> <p>While avoiding criticism of the sheer size of City and Wall Street bonuses, the panel criticises the way pay packages are put together, saying that incentives have \"inadvertently produced patterns of behaviour and allocations of resources\" that are not always consistent with \"the basic goal of financial stability\".</p> <p>Called the counterparty risk management policy group, the panel's members include representatives from HSBC, Citigroup, Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley, BNP Paribas and Merrill Lynch. </p> <p>In a striking recommendation, they say that complex instruments should only be sold to carefully vetted, sophisticated clients which have the wherewithal to withstand heavy losses and to analyse the risks involved.</p> <p>These investments, say the panel, should come with an extensive term sheet setting out all their characteristics. This sheet should have a \"financial health warning\" displayed in bold print which alerts investors to the risk of \"significant loss\".</p> <p>Elsewhere, the bankers call for regular meetings between regulators and the boards of directors of financial institutions. They suggest improved stress testing by banks, brainstorming to identify risky \"hot spots\" and frank disclosure of assets held off banks' balance sheets \u2013 using a \"holistic and principles-based approach\".</p> <p>The findings are to be sent to the US treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, and to Mario Draghi, the governor of Italy's central bank who chairs the international financial stability forum.</p> <p>Since it began with a meltdown in the sub-prime mortgage market a year ago, the credit crunch has led to the collapse of America's fifth largest investment bank, Bear Stearns, and troubles at high-street banks around the world including Britain's Northern Rock and California's IndyMac Bancorp.</p> <p>Many argue that the banking crisis has been aggravated by \"creativity\" within institutions in coming up with increasingly esoteric financial products \u2013 including collateralised debt obligations, auction-rate securities and credit default swaps.</p> <p>The panel said write-offs taken by banks in the US and Europe are of \"staggering proportions\" and that firms were troublingly slow to realise the magnitude of the crisis, lulled into a false sense of security by earlier disturbances which quickly resolved themselves.</p> <p>\"It is probably fair to say that, as late as the summer of 2007, virtually none of us would have imagined that, as of July 2008, financial sector write-offs and loss provisions would approach $500bn, even as the write-off meter is still running,\" say the bankers.</p>",
  "<p>A month ago, at the G8 summit in Tokyo, developed nations <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/11/g8\">showed</a> how out of touch they were with the changing reality of the world. With last week's breakdown of the Doha round of global trade talks in <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/31/business/worldbusiness/31trade.html?em&amp;ex=1217649600&amp;en=ab0166a68ef58dd0&amp;ei=5087%0A\">Geneva</a>, the rising economic powers are making their voices heard.</p> <p>Those who relish the relative decline of the west can only cheer. The era when it could dictate trade terms through the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and its predecessors certainly belongs to history. But the new dawn may not turn out to have quite the rosy glow that the declinists detect.</p> <p>First, the big developing economies are far from forming a solid grouping with identical interests. Brazil, in particular, has taken a different position this summer to India, China or African countries. As a country that has the natural resources and food that others want, it is in a position of independence that dictates its approach to trade. China and India are all for opening up the markets of others for their exports, but followed lines at Geneva that would have limited the degree of reciprocation, which, in turn, would have worked against the poorer agricultural producers. As for the fourth member of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRIC\">Bric</a> group, Russia's energy riches put it in a category of its own \u2013 and the G8 showed it trying to have one foot in the developed camp and the other with its Bric colleagues. </p> <p>Add in the specific concerns of the other major source of new wealth, the Gulf states, which are usually conveniently omitted from such discussions despite their financial muscle, plus the differences within Latin America and Africa, and you are left with a rich variety of interests subject to wide variations. Not to mention resource-rich Australia, or South Korea or virtually indefinable Indonesia.</p> <p>I suppose it might be argued that there is no need for overall order in world trade, and that country-to-country deals represent the future. But a broad-based system with clear rules and procedures is calculated to encourage both general exchanges and bilateral trade as the example of China since it joined the WTO demonstrates.</p> <p>Global trade anarchy, on the other hand, would encourage commercial wars, preferential arrangements and competitive devaluations. The post-1929 example provides sufficient evidence of that. The financial crisis that is brewing around us would be hugely aggravated if it were accompanied by the kind of me-first policies that characterised the 1930s. Global financial flows are out of control; the last thing that is needed is a breakdown of the global trading system which, for all its exploitation, has brought more people into a materially upwardly-mobile system than ever before in human history.</p> <p>Some may not like any of this, but they have never made a convincing case as far as I can see. Coastal China may have a plethora of sweatshops and western companies may pad their profits by moving production there; but why do 100 million migrant workers move from the inland to the coast to work in them? Because they offer a way to material betterment for them and for those who stayed back on the farm and get their remittances. That may be unpalatable to western liberals, but it represents a choice that must be respected. The People's Republic chose this path 30 years ago, and its people have voted overwhelmingly with their feet to follow it.</p> <p>Nor should the anti-western argument be allowed to fool anybody that China, India and other developing countries were acting at Geneva in anything but their own direct self-interest. There is nothing surprising or reprehensible about that, but nor is there anything exemplary. Being poor may mean you should be helped, but it does not mean you are right. </p> <p>For all its travails, the achievement of the WTO and its predecessors has been to provide a forum which could produce solutions of general interest from negotiation and mutual concessions, based on self-interest that went beyond the most basic of calculations. This was, naturally, less dramatic than the <a href=\"http://www.globalissues.org/TradeRelated/Seattle.asp\">Seattle demonstrations</a> or the breakdown in Geneva. Global structures and systems find it hard to get a good press, particularly in an age where many see them as the exploitative emanation of the evil west and overlook the fact that the WTO is too democratic for its own good. <a href=\"http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/24926.html\">Winston Churchill</a>'s remark about democracy might be trotted out here.</p> <p>For all its faults, the Doha round is the best way of organising world trade we have. Those who glory in its crisis as vindication of their crusade against the US-led policies that have underpinned globalisation might answer a simple question: what would they put in its place, who would they install in the driving seat, and how would they ensure continued growth for the poorer nations that know how trade can lift their people out of poverty?</p>",
  "<p>American authorities have uncovered a massive global computer hacking and credit card fraud ring spanning the US, eastern Europe and Asia, officials said this week.</p> <p>The US justice department has charged 11 individuals from the US, China and three former Soviet republics with stealing more than 40m credit and debit card numbers and selling them to criminals in the US and Europe, in a case that highlights the increasing vulnerability of world commerce to hackers and identity thieves.</p> <p>The indictments culminate a three-year investigation involving law enforcement authorities from at least four countries.<br>America's top law enforcement official, Attorney General Michael Mukasey, said the financial toll in the case is \"impossible to quantify at this point\".</p> <p>Justice department attorney Michael Sullivan said that most of the victims were in the US, but said officials have yet to identify all those whose credit card numbers were stolen.</p> <p>\"I suspect that a lot of people are unaware that their identifying information has been compromised,\" he said.</p> <p>According to justice department officials and court documents, the ring mined credit and debit card numbers by driving alongside US retail stores in search of wireless internet connections. Among the companies attacked were TJX Companies, owner of TJ Maxx clothing outlets; Barnes and Noble; OfficeMax; Sports Authority and others.</p> <p>Upon gaining access to the computer networks, the defendants installed \"sniffer\" software that would surreptitiously record card numbers, justice department officials said. The defendants then sold the numbers over the internet to individuals who encoded them onto blank credit cards and withdrew tens of thousands of dollars at a time from cash machines.</p> <p>According to court documents unsealed this week, three of the defendants, Sergey Pavlovich of Belarus and Dzmitry Burak and Sergey Storchak of Ukraine, used a website on which credit card number traffickers bought and sold numbers, with Pavlovich taking a percentage of the sales.</p> <p>In addition, two other defendants, Maksym Yastremskiy of Kharkov, Ukraine and Aleksandr Suvorov of Sillamae, Estonia, known on the internet as JonnyHell, tricked staff at a Long Island, New York, restaurant into allowing them access to computer cash registers, the justice department said in court documents. </p> <p>They then installed sniffer software that captured credit and debit card numbers. Justice officials said Yastremskiy pocketed more than $11m from the sale of the stolen numbers.</p> <p>One of the defendants, Albert Gonzalez of Miami, was an informant for the US secret service, the agency tasked with protecting the US president and combating financial fraud and counterfeiting. </p> <p>He faces life in prison if convicted on all charges.</p> <p>Mukasey said the case highlights the global economy's vulnerability to computer hackers, although he urged consumers to remain confident in the nation's electronic payment system.</p> <p>\"Computer networks and the internet are an indispensable part of the world economy,\" Mukasey said yesterday. \"But even as they provide extraordinary opportunities for legitimate commerce and communication, they also provide extraordinary opportunities for criminals. Where criminals are able to breach computer security systems, as alleged here, they have enormous ability to cause harm.\"</p> <p>But John Pescatore, a wireless security analyst at US consulting firm Gartner Inc, said the retailers could have prevented the breaches with available technology.</p> <p>\"These stores just did not take the right precautions and the bad guys said 'Cool, we can sit in the parking lot and break into the retailer through the wireless network,'\" he said. \"This was a failure by the companies cited. It was the equivalent of if your bank didn't lock the door to the vault.\"</p> <p>The defendants were charged with crimes including identity theft, possession of \"unauthorised access devices\", and offences connected to the stolen card data.</p> <p>Two Chinese defendants, Burak, Storchak, Pavlovich and a person known only by the internet nickname \"Delpiero\" remain at large. </p> <p>Turkish police captured Yastremskiy in July 2007 when he was in the country on vacation, the justice department said. Suvorov was apprehended in March by German police in Frankfurt. The US seeks his extradition.</p> <p>The defendants maintained operations in China, the Philippines and Thailand, the justice department said.</p> <p>\"So far as we know, this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country,\" Mukasey said.</p>",
  "<p>National stereotypes are notoriously hard to overcome, as modern Germany can testify. As Berlin sees it, a distressingly large number of Britons, encouraged by tabloid newspapers, persist in viewing Germans as goose-stepping, deckchair-stealing, inhumanly efficient Teutons with tendencies towards world domination.</p> <p>Much of the world seems to view the British in their turn as bumbling bowler-hatted City gents, effete Cambridge-educated spies, or red-faced hooligans who get fighting drunk at football matches. As for the French, it was established long ago that their breath smells of garlic, their armies cannot fight, and their leaders cannot be trusted -\u2013 or so the parody goes.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://www.simonanholt.blogspot.com/\">Simon Anholt</a>, an expert on branding, heritage and identity, perceptions of countries and peoples, positive or negative, accurate or absurdist, are highly resistant to change:</p> <blockquote> <p>National image is so stable because we all seem to need these comforting stereotypes that enable us to put countries in convenient pigeon-holes \u2026 National reputation cannot be constructed. It can only be earned.</p> </blockquote> <p>Undeterred by such warnings, governments around the world continually try, as ever, to boost their country's international standing and influence. But instead of pursuing these aims through warfare, domination, subversion, Machiavellian statecraft and secret alliances, as in the past, many are reaching for a fashionable new tool: \"public diplomacy\".</p> <p>Originally coined in the 1960s, public diplomacy is a means of advancing national foreign policy, security and economic objectives by engaging directly with peoples rather than with their governments \u2013 thereby rendering them more receptive and sympathetic to a given message or policy. Sceptics say this is merely a posh name for propaganda; proponents say public diplomacy's purposes are more benign.</p> <p>As Alex Evans and David Steven explain in a new Foreign Office <a href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/about-the-fco/publications/publications/pd-publication/\">study</a>, the use of public diplomacy is increasing because the sternest tests facing governments aren't susceptible to home-grown or state-to-state solutions. They say: </p> <blockquote> <p>Look at today's biggest global issues \u2013 climate change, pandemics, energy security, terrorism and other 'shadow sides' of globalisation \u2013 and it's striking that the challenges governments find it hardest to deal with are highly diffuse, involving the actions and beliefs of millions (if not billions) of people.</p> </blockquote> <p>The relative powerlessness of individual nations is exacerbated by the poor record of multilateral institutions in delivering global solutions. The World Trade Organisation's failure to agree <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha_Development_Round\">new trade rules</a> and the UN's under-shooting of its own millennium <a href=\"http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/\">goals</a> are cases in point.</p> <p>Obtaining measurable, beneficial results from public diplomacy is entirely possible, but certain principles must be observed, said <a href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/about-the-fco/publications/publications/pd-publication/7-lessons\">Professor Nicholas Cull</a> of the University of Southern California.</p> <p>An example of how not to do it was provided by Karen Hughes who, in her newly-created role as US under-secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs, undertook a Middle East \"<a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2005-09-22-hughes-listening-tour_x.htm\">listening tour</a>\" in 2005, Cull said. The exercise was attacked by Arab audiences and media as a patronising display of Bush administration arrogance and ignorance. Instead of winning hearts and minds, it soured them.</p> <p>Winston Churchill performed better when he successfully sought to persuade the American public in 1940-41 that the biggest empire the world had ever known was the underdog in its war with Hitler's Germany. Churchill achieved this feat in part by allowing American journalists to freely report from London, thereby validating his message.</p> <p>Maintaining high credibility is a key element in pursuing successful public diplomacy, moulding image and influencing perceptions, Cull said. Other must-dos include ensuring that actions match words (often a problem for governments), adept and timely use of media, acceptance that this quintessential \"soft power\" tool will not produce quick results, and adherence to the Confucian concept of \"attracting by virtue\" \u2013 in other words, seizing and holding the moral high ground. </p> <p>\"A small number of people can cause a great deal of damage,\" Cull said, citing the adverse impact on America's worldwide reputation resulting from the actions of a few US prison guards at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq.</p> <p>Some countries are better at public diplomacy than others. Iran is a good example of how a small government clique can turn a proud nation into a pariah. Ireland is the opposite, having apparently convinced just about everybody of its innate goodness and charm despite a moderately violent recent past.</p> <p>According to Cull, China comes bottom of the class, having grasped the wrong end of the stick, perhaps deliberately. The unelected ruling communists use public diplomacy not to influence outsiders but to legitimise themselves in the eyes of their own people, he said.</p> <p>Like Brezhnev's Soviet Union, China had created an \"immense bureaucracy whose aim is not to engage foreigners but to build a reassuring (but fictitious) image, for domestic consumption, of global admiration for their country\". The Olympics mark the culmination of that Orwellian endeavour.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/yahoo\">Yahoo</a> has been forced to admit shareholder opposition to CEO Jerry Yang's re-election to the board of directors last week was much stronger than it first reported. </p> <p>The company blames a vote counting error by a third party company for under-reporting the opposition to Yang and chairman Roy Bostock, both of whom received about twice as many negative votes than the numbers announced on Friday after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/aug/01/yahoo.meeting\">the Yahoo annual meeting</a>. </p> <p>Broadridge Financial Solutions, the company that counted shareholder votes, has admitted it made a mistake.

Carl Ichan, a corporate raider and proponent of the takeover, was elected to the board as part of a previously agreed truce between him and the company. He also will be able to recommend two additional members. </p> <p>Icahn saw his election to the board as a compromise as he realised he could not win a proxy fight to remove the whole board. If Microsoft \u2013 or another potential buyer - returns to the negotiating table, Icahn will be in a stronger position to influence the outcome. </p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.icahnreport.com/report/2008/07/how-i-spent-my.html\">Icahn</a> noted on his blog: \"The board has agreed in the settlement agreement that any meaningful transaction, including the strategy in dealing with that transaction, will be fully discussed with the entire board before any final decision is made.\" </p> <p>Although the voting error did not change the results, experts are hinting that Bostock may be forced to step down as support for him is particularly weak. </p> <p>He received a smaller percentage of votes than former CEO Terry Semel did last year. Semel resigned from his position six days later and stepped down from the company's board in January. </p> <p>The news of the voting glitch was announced after the markets closed on Tuesday. When trading began Wednesday morning, the company's share price dropped a fraction to about $19.70, which is about $1 above their 52-week low. </p> <p>They traded as high as $34.08 earlier this year, after Microsoft went public with its takeover plans.</p>",

  "<p>Samples containing perchlorate were found in and around the \"Snow White\" trench dug by Phoenix's robotic arm. NASA/JPL-Caltech/University of Arizona</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/phoenix/news/phoenix-20080805.html\">Martian soil appears to contain perchlorate salts</a>, according to <a href=\"http://twitter.com/MarsPhoenix\">the latest twitterings from Nasa's Phoenix Mars Lander</a>. The presence of perchlorate generated rumours this week because of suggestions that it meant that the soil is less friendly to life than previously thought. </p> <p>Not so, according to Michael Hecht of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, who said that \"finding perchlorates is neither good nor bad for life\". However, he said different perchlorate salts have different properties that could \"make us reassess how we think about life on Mars\" if the finding were confirmed and perchlorate was found at other sites. <br></p> <p>One possibility, for example, is that the soil samples were contaminated by perchlorates transported from Earth on the lander. Although the fuel of Phoenix itself contains no perchlorates, they were used in the boosters during launch. </p> <p>Perchlorates are ions consisting of an atom of chlorine surrounded by four oxygen atoms. They are weak oxidants meaning that they tend to transfer oxygen atoms in chemical reactions. <a href=\"http://twitter.com/MarsPhoenix/statuses/878712068\">On Earth, organisms coexist with perchlorates in arid places such as Chile's Atacama desert.</a> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/audioclips/phx-20080805/cut1.mp3\">Another Mars Phoenix scientist, Samuel Kounaves, confirmed that \"it's a benign chemical in terms of most organisms\"</a>.

  "<p>Maybe the snow in the Washington state's Cascade mountains isn't in such immediate peril from global warming after all.</p> <p>Despite previous studies suggesting a warmer climate is already taking a bite out of Washington's snowpack, there's no clear evidence that human-induced climate change has caused a drop in 20th century snow levels, according to a new study by University of Washington scientists.</p> <p>In fact, the newest study also predicts the Cascade snows - vital to water supplies, crop irrigation and salmon - could enjoy a delay in the effects of global warming.</p> <p>But the findings have already become part of a scientific debate with an unusually political tone. It's an ongoing disagreement that has UW researchers taking sides against each other and has attracted the attention of political groups.</p> <p>And a leading scientist on the other side of the debate said the latest analysis speculates about the future and offers little new about the past.</p> <p>\"They're trying to forecast the next 20 years or so, and I don't think they can do it,\" said Alan Hamlet, a UW hydrologist who has written papers about historic Cascade snowpack.</p> <p>Past studies have frequently focused on steep declines in Cascade snowpack in the second half of the 20th century, with drops measuring 30% or more.</p> <p>But Cliff Mass, a well-known UW meteorologist, said the new study, which he co-authored, shows it all depends on which years are examined. He and his co-authors argue snow levels were unusually high in the 1950s, creating a distorted picture of historic patterns.</p> <p>Measurement of mountain snow levels were spotty before the 1950s, making it harder to get a complete picture. But Mass and his colleagues tried to estimate snowpack for earlier years based on measurement that did exist: the amount of water that flowed down streams as snow melted.</p> <p>Using that method, they found a smaller drop in snowpack between the 1930s and today \u2013 23%. That still may sound like a big drop, but the scientists argue that it could be statistically insignificant, so it's hard to say whether it's meaningful. They also say that many of the changes appear to be attributable to shifting weather patterns driven by the Pacific ocean.</p> <p>\"We can't see the global-warming signature in terms of a decline in snowpack,\" said Mark Stoelinga, the study's lead author, and a professor in the UW's atmospheric sciences department.</p> <p>But, Mass doesn't say there's nothing to worry about. The north-west US is still on course for a big drop in snowpack - and the accompanying water-supply problems - by the end of the 21st century.</p> <p>\"We're in a place that is not going to warm up as quickly,\" Mass said at a recent conference by free-market think tank, the Washington Policy Centre. But \"eventually global warming will have a profound effect\".</p> <p>The study has not yet been peer-reviewed.</p> <p>Hamlet counters that the bigger historical picture - gradually declining snowpack over the 20th century - has already been put forward, most recently in a study published this year. </p> <p>In fact, he wrote it, along with state climatologist Philip Mote, another UW scientist who has been a primary player in the ongoing dispute. Mote couldn't be reached to review the latest study.</p>",
  "<p>California's legislators have been <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE6D61531F93AA25754C0A964958260\">bickering over a budget</a> for months now. The budget was supposed to be signed in July. As happens almost every year, come August there is <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/08/04/BA2212523E.DTL&amp;tsp=1\">still no budget</a>.</p> <p>Partly that's because Democrats and Republicans in the statehouse can't agree on whether to raise taxes or cut services, and at times it appears the party leaders are <a href=\"http://www.beyondchron.org/articles/Schwarzenegger_Sinks_to_New_Low_5937.html\">more interested in embarrassing their opponents</a> than in hashing out coherent financial decisions. California is one of only a few states that insist a budget be passed by a two-thirds vote by legislators in both houses, thus allowing a small group of legislators to exercise veto power of the budget. Partly it's to do with the fact that the state's finances are chronically out of whack, with legislators hobbled by a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_13_(1978)\">series of ballot initiatives</a> passed over the previous 30 years that have had the effect of limiting local and state tax bases. In essence, California's voters want services, but they are notoriously reluctant to release the tax dollars that make these services possible.</p> <p>This year, however, the impasse has been made more urgent by the dire condition of the national economy and the trickle-down effect this has had on state government. A few months ago, California's analysts believed the state was looking at a deficit of a few billion dollars, a manageable, if unpleasant, phenomenon for a state with an annual budget of over $100bn. But as the economy has hit the skids, the problems have grown exponentially worse. Now that deficit is thought to be nearer $15bn, with some predicting it could rise to $20bn.</p> <p>Put simply, it means that about one in every five dollars spent by the state is now money it doesn't have. Given California is already spending about 7% of its budget servicing its existing debt - a legacy of the above-mentioned reluctance to countenance adequate tax levels - that's more than merely a nuisance. If governor Arnold Schwarzenegger is to be believed, it threatens to utterly derail state finances. A numbers of reports have labelled this California's worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.</p> <p>Now, clearly a $15bn hole is a large problem. Yet it's hardly unique. Over the past year, the financial meltdown precipitated by the sub-prime mortgage crisis has led to \"writedowns\" in the private sector at least equal in size to California's budget-gap. Merrill Lynch, Citibank, Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2026 the list of financial companies that have had to eat multibillion-dollar losses goes on. In the broader economy, Detroit's auto giants have also absorbed staggering losses. </p> <p>Moreover, in its increasingly desperate attempts to stop the wheels coming off the whole system, over the past year the federal government has eaten hundreds of billions of dollars in losses, bailing out Bear Stearns, stepping in to shore up Fannie Mae, releasing $100bn in emergency tax cuts to individuals, guaranteeing the money owed to customers in failed banks such as the recently-deceased IndyMac. Recently, Congress passed the biggest housing bill in decades, committing the feds to bail out hundreds of thousands of homeowners at risk of seeing their homes go into foreclosure. At a state government level, New York is also facing a multibillion-dollar revenue shortfall, albeit one considerably smaller than that of California's.</p> <p>This can be interpreted in one of two ways. Either California's crisis is not quite as bad as the governor and others have portrayed it, since everybody and their uncle is now rolling around in losses that involve numbers ending in 10 or 11 zeroes. Or the banking and government crisis is really, really bad, with private banks, mortgage companies and investment firms taking hits that are big enough to knock the largest and wealthiest state in America off stride - and with local, state and federal governments sliding into levels of indebtedness that will likely prove utterly ruinous over the long run.</p> <p>Pessimist that I am, I increasingly tend toward the latter interpretation. After all, California isn't play-acting at being in trouble. It really is in a miserable situation. The $15bn deficit has led to t<a href=\"http://www.sacbee.com/static/weblogs/the_state_worker/\">ens of thousands of state employees being laid off</a> (initial estimates were that over 20,000 would lose their jobs, but that number was subsequently reduced to slightly over 10,000), the paring down of government services, Schwarzenegger's order last week to place <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-me-budget24-2008jul24,0,2620443.story\">200,000 state employees on the federal minimum wage</a> come September should legislators not swallow their differences and negotiate a budget, escalating costs of borrowing on the bond market, the decimation of state-funded medical and social services for the poor and elderly and a massive contraction of state aid to already-overstretched local governments.</p> <p>The risk is that a downward spiral has started, one that comes complete with its own feedback loops. As house values slide, a declining property tax base is leading to cuts in local services. These cuts push regional economies further into recession, thus magnifying conditions triggered by the national slowdown. This, in turn, lowers the state's ability to raise money through taxes, which leads to further reductions in jobs and services, which leads to less money flowing through the whole system and a gradual erosion of private-sector purchasing power.</p> <p>In the same way as global warming begets more warming \u2013 liquid water absorbs heat, for example, while ice caps reflect it; hotter climates lead to more use of air conditioning units, which pushes yet more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere \u2013 so the current recession, anchored as it is by high energy prices, increased competition for scarce natural resources and declining liquidity in global credit markets risks begetting more recession. Private sector slowdowns cascade into government crises, and the faltering government expenditures then spill back over into the private sector. </p> <p>The conditions are in place for a great unravelling of the borrowing-based mass consumption culture. It's tempting to engage in a bit of schadenfreude, an \"I told you so\" gloating about how a culture that wants everything yet isn't willing to tax itself adequately in order to pay for it is simply getting its comeuppance. The problem is the people getting hammered by this unravelling are the poorest and most vulnerable populations. </p> <p>There's nothing remotely satisfying in seeing California close community health clinics, reduce library hours or put hundreds of thousands of workers onto minimum wage. Yet it is, I fear, a harbinger of years of hard times still to come.</p>",
  "<p>The race to carve up the Arctic for its oil, gas and mineral reserves has been charted for the first time in an attempt to alert international policy makers to serious territorial disputes that could result.</p> <p> A <a href=\"http://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/ibru/arctic.pdf\">new map (pdf)</a> is designed to illustrate historical, ongoing and potential arguments about ownership in the competition to control areas rich in natural resources. </p> <p>Its publication by Durham University researchers comes as a growing number of states including the UK cast their eyes towards polar regions and big slices of the ocean floors. </p> <p>Countries must establish sovereignty over disputed territories if they are to exploit their undiscovered, technologically recoverable energy reserves. </p> <p>The attempts to assert such rights have already alarmed conservationists who want better international protection for the poles as climate change melts the ice and opens up more land and seabeds for exploration.</p> <p>Last year, a Russian submarine planted a flag on the seabed below the North Pole to highlight its claim to a big chunk of the Arctic.

  "<p>On Saturday I did what all self-respecting London Olympics sceptics do: I walked round the site of the <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/plans/index.php\">Olympic Park</a> adjoining Stratford and pondered the wild folly of it all. </p> <p>There was plenty to confirm my view: the glossy billboard on the wooden perimeter fence explaining at great, resource-consuming length the environment-friendliness of its forthcoming electrified wire successor; the insistence of a guard near the security centre that I cease photographing the images of joyful, Olympics-inspired fellow Londoners adorning its surrounds; my calculation that half the 2012 track finals would be easily completed within the space of the few minutes I spent contemplating the fawn moonscape of the site itself, where the stadium will take the best part of four years to build.</p> <p>Can the games possibly deliver on their promises? Everything conspired to fortify my doubts. Delusional in their ambitions and absurd in their expense, the 2012 games will surely fail to inspire a generation of British couch potatoes to run, jump or <a href=\"http://www.olympic.org/uk/sports/programme/disciplines_uk.asp?DiscCode=SY\">synchronise swim</a> and fail too to bring prosperity to the capital's East End. </p> <p>But as my long trudge took me along the Greenway \u2013 an optimistically-named nature trail from which the illustrious Diamond Geezer <a href=\"http://diamondgeezer.blogspot.com/2008_07_01_archive.html#2984170661134004280\">reports</a> every month \u2013 a countervailing sentiment took hold. Dignify it as a refusal to follow the crowd or call it plain contrary, I found a part of me rebelling against the growing cast of Olympics doomsayers. Some of its higher-profile members are simply drawlingly dismissive of the very idea of sport. Others have political motives. Compared with such comfortable negativity, the shining, perhaps <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/jul/27/sebastiancoe\">hopelessly romantic optimism</a> of Sebastian Coe can seem rather attractive. </p> <p>And I've a more practical reason for hoping that the games live up to their organisers' rhetoric. It is that they are happening on my own doorstep. My walk began and ended two-and-a-half hours later at my own front door. Boundlessly upbeat promotional literature about \"Your Park\" tumbles through that door's letterbox at regular intervals. A large photograph of London's first hosting of the Olympics in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletics_at_the_1908_Summer_Olympics\">1908</a> adorns a corridor of my local sports hall. Soon after Mayor Boris Johnson performs his hotly-anticipated flag-waving at the Beijing games' closing ceremony, my local authority and those of east London's other \"Olympic boroughs\" will embark in earnest on the task of converting their school pupils to the joys of athletic endeavour and encouraging their jobseekers to train up as potential Olympian plumbers and electricians. </p> <p>How am I supposed to respond? Should I join the great <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/v30/n12/sinc01_.html\">intellectual mourning</a> for the loss of Carpenters Road, the winding, twilight avenue of workshops and warehouses that once connected Stratford to Leyton, or warm to the soaring ambitions of the Olympics evangelists, if only for their mad naivety? Which course would offer the greatest rewards? Four years (and more) of unadulterated spiritual opposition or a resolve to recognise and, if possible, encourage, such benefits to my neighbourhood and its people as I can detect? </p> <p>The answer can only be the latter. I am, after all, stuck with the games whether I like them or not. And maybe it's a little more than just making the best of a bad job. I can, with an effort, empathise with the Seb Coes of this world in their immersion in whatever has survived of the Olympic dream. I recall the day, many years ago, when my searing sprint finish took me past the school bully to win my school's under-13s cross-country: a personal triumph over physical exhaustion but also a moral victory. Sport's improving qualities are often glibly overstated, but they do have that capacity. The same is true of the whole 2012 games lunacy. There's nothing for it but to cheer up and hope for the best possible result. Sport is so marvellous and stupid in that way.</p>",
  "<p>The global airline industry will fly 60m fewer seats in the run-up to Christmas - equivalent to a 7% cut in flights - as the oil spike and economic downturn force carriers to axe services.</p> <p>Experts predicted even deeper cuts in 2009 as part of a prolonged retrenchment of an industry that has expanded rapidly in recent years. Airlines will offer 59.7m fewer seats between October and December compared with the same period last year, said flight information company OAG. The UK's biggest carriers have already confirmed significant capacity cuts, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/ryanair\">Ryanair</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/easyjetbusiness\">easyJet</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/britishairwaysbusiness\">British Airways</a> all reducing services over the winter.</p> <p>Leading industry consultant Chris Tarry said the worldwide cuts, led by US carriers including Continental and American Airlines, will be followed by further reductions next year as airlines pay the price for expanding their fleets by nearly 1,700 aircraft since 2005. According to Boeing, the global commercial airline fleet stood at 19,000 planes at the end of last year. </p> <p>\"As we move into the later part of this year, airlines are taking a view on just how difficult the market is going to be. I don't think we have seen all the likely capacity adjustments at this stage. For airlines, 2009 is going to be even more difficult than 2008,\" said Tarry.</p> <p>OAG echoed the comments of BA boss Willie Walsh, who said last week that the airline industry faced its \"worst ever\" trading environment. Steve Casley, OAG's chief operating officer, said: \"From our statistics, it looks quite possible that we may be facing a far more severe global downturn than we have experienced before.\"</p> <p>Casley added that routes will be axed at 275 airports around the world in the final quarter of the year. BA has dropped six European short-haul routes from Gatwick, while Ryanair has also dropped a number of destinations in Croatia and France from its Stansted schedules. A third of the global capacity cuts are taking place in the US domestic market, but the transatlantic market is moving in the opposite direction with a 1% increase in seats - due to the Open Skies treaty that has liberalised air travel between the US and Europe.</p> <p>The Asian market, one of the brightest performers in recent years, is effectively unwinding three years of capacity growth by making a 13% reduction in flights. The capacity decline is even worse than the reduction that followed the September 11 2001 terror attacks, when the number of seats flown fell by 5%. </p> <p>\"The industry's resilience will be pushed to its limits in the coming months, with carriers, airports and passengers alike all waiting and watching for a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel,\" said OAG's Casley.</p>",

  "<p>In her new book, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/not-in-my-name-by-julie-burchill--chas-newkeyburden-882264.html\">Not In My Name</a>, Julie Burchill reserves her grandest fury about hypocrites for environmentalists. We are, she (and her co-author, Chas Newkey-Burden) say, pious, sexless and contemptuous of humankind. We are all posh and rich, and have found in environmentalism a new excuse for lecturing the poor. We tell other people to live by rules we don't apply to ourselves. </p> <p>Like all stereotypes, these claims are lazy, familiar and sometimes true. Burchill knows nothing about environmentalism, and, almost as a point of pride, hasn't bothered to find out, but when you use grapeshot you are bound to hit someone. Yes, many prominent greens are posh gits like me. The same can be said of journalists, politicians, artists, academics, business leaders \u2026 in fact, of just about anyone in public life. But it is always the greens who are singled out. </p> <p>In truth, while the upper middle classes are, as always, over-represented in the media, the movement cuts across the classes. A recent ICM poll <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jul/02/climatechange.ethicalliving\">found</a> that more people in social classes D and E thought the government should prioritise the environment over the economy (56%) than in classes A and B (47%). </p> <p>Environmentalism is the most politically diverse movement in history. Here <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/kingsnorthclimatecamp\">in the Kingsnorth climate camp</a>, I have met anarchists, communists, socialists, liberals, conservatives and, mostly, pragmatists. I remember sitting in a campaign meeting during the Newbury bypass protests and marvelling at the weirdness of our coalition. In the front row sat the local squirearchy: brigadiers in tweeds and enormous moustaches, titled women in twin sets and headscarves. In the middle were local burghers of all shapes and sizes. At the back sat the scuzziest collection of grunge-skunks I have ever laid eyes on. The audience disagreed about every other subject under the sun \u2013 if someone had asked us to decide what day of the week it was, the meeting would had descended into fisticuffs \u2013 but everyone there recognised that our quality of life depends on the quality of our surroundings. </p> <p>The environment is inseparable from social justice. Climate change, for example, is primarily about food and water. It threatens the fresh water supplies required to support human life. As continental interiors dry out and the glaciers feeding many of the rivers used for irrigation disappear, climate change presents the greatest of all threats to the future prospects of the poor. The rich will survive for a few decades at least, as they can use their money to insulate themselves from the effects. The poor are being hammered already. </p> <p>In reality, it is people like Julie Burchill \u2013 who is, incidentally, far richer than almost any green I have met \u2013 who treats the poor with contempt. So that she can revel in what she calls \"reckless romantic modernism\", other people must die. But at least you can't accuse her of hypocrisy: she cannot fail to live by her moral code, for the simple reason that she doesn't have one. </p> <p>Sure, we are hypocrites. Every one of us, almost by definition. Hypocrisy is the gap between your aspirations and your actions. Greens have high aspirations \u2013 they want to live more ethically \u2013 and they will always fall short. But the alternative to hypocrisy isn't moral purity (no one manages that), but cynicism. Give me hypocrisy any day.</p>",

  "<p>Inflation on the high street soared in July to reach its highest in more than 18 months, with food nearly 10% more expensive than a year ago, a survey published today showed. </p> <p>According to the British Retail Consortium (BRC) shop price deflator, shop prices last month were 3.2% higher than a year ago. This is a significant increase on June's year-on-year shop price inflation figure of 2.5%, and is the biggest increase since the survey began in December 2006. </p> <p>Annual food price inflation hit 9.5% in July, up from 7% in June. Non-food prices edged up by 0.1% year-on-year in July. This was down from a rise of 0.2% in June. </p> <p>Stephen Robertson at the BRC said: \"Our figures show that some non-food goods, including electricals and clothing, are cheaper than they were a year ago. Both food and non-food prices are going up more slowly than gas or petrol bills. Overall food prices are rising but retailers are keeping increases well below the extra supply and operating costs they face. </p> <p>\"Falls in the prices of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/oil\">oil</a> and some world food commodities, such as wheat and soya, provide hope but most retail costs remain sharply up on a year ago and are still rising.\" </p> <p>This news will put more pressure on the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, which is battling the twin risks of rising inflation and the possibility of Britain entering recession. The Bank's committee will announce their decision for this month's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/interestrates\">interest rates</a> on Thursday. </p> <p>Howard Archer, the chief UK and European economist at Global Insight, said today's sharp rise in the shop price deflator was worrying news for the Bank. </p> <p>\"While shop prices continue to be pushed up primarily by high food prices, the Bank of England will also note that non-food prices edged up year-on-year for a second month running in July after extended falls. </p> <p>\"This will maintain concern that retailers are increasingly trying to pass on their elevated costs. At least the year-on-year rise in non-food prices was less than in June and is only marginal,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Michael Grade, the executive chairman of ITV, has warned that the broadcaster's \u00a31bn programming budget could be reduced next year unless regulatory burdens including its public service broadcasting commitments are removed.</p> <p>Grade said today that in a weaker advertising market regulatory issues such as contracts rights renewal, the formula that protects advertisers from ITV abusing its dominant market position in British TV airtime sales, and its public service broadcasting requirements needed to be resolved swiftly.</p> <p>He added that ITV estimated that getting rid of CRR and cutting back on its PSB commitments would free up \u00a3300m of extra investment.</p> <p>Grade's comments came as ITV today unveiled its results for the six months to the end of June and admitted that it faces a 20% year-on-year fall in ad revenue in September.</p> <p>ITV's share price fell by more than 10% on last night's close, about 5p, to 41.5p in early trading today at 8.45am after the results announcement. The share price had recovered slightly to 42.3p by 11am.</p> <p>The company also posted a 28% dive in adjusted pre tax profits and a 20% fall in operating profits year-on-year in its interim results for the first six months this year.</p> <p>\"It is unequivocal evidence, absolutely empirical evidence, that action needs to be taken now to relieve us. It is just not acceptable,\" Grade said. </p> <p>\"The value of the licences under which we operate has diminished. The regulator [Ofcom] fully understands the issue\u2026 where we differ is timing.\"</p> <p>Grade said that \"slashing\" programme investment in 2009 would be a \"false economy\" that would impact the growth of ITV's business in the longer term.</p> <p>\"The thing most likely to impact our ability to maintain investment is the slowness of regulatory relief we require. That is the one thing that could hit programming budgets,\" he added.</p> <p>Grade also said that it would be wrong to draw any firm conclusions about the state of the UK ad market in the fourth quarter of 2008 as a whole from the severe drop forecast for September.</p> <p>The whole UK TV ad market during the last quarter is currently predicted to be down by between 5% and 8%.</p> <p>ITV's total broadcasting revenues fell by \u00a310m year-on-year to \u00a3832m for the six months to the end of June.</p> <p>Flagship channel ITV1's net advertising revenue was \u00a3583m, down from \u00a3595m in the same period last year.</p> <p>ITV's multichannel portfolio, including ITV2, saw revenues rise from \u00a395m to \u00a3113m for the period.</p> <p>Broadcasting operating profits fell by 21% to \u00a389m, primarily due to the \"front weighting\" of the programming budget for the first half of the year, particularly Euro 2008, as well as lower income from premium-rate phone services.</p> <p>Revenues from the global content division were up 3% year-on-year for the period, from \u00a3277m to \u00a3285m, with external revenues up 30%.</p> <p>The company said that while internet advertising has continued to grow strongly there are \"some indications that the wider slowdown in advertising will impact online revenue\".</p> <p>ITV's online revenues rose from \u00a316m to \u00a317m for the six months to the end of June.</p> <p>Revenues at ITV.com - including itvlocal.com and ITV Mobile - increased by \u00a32m to \u00a37m, while Friends Reunited saw a \u00a31m drop in revenues to \u00a310m.</p> <p>ITV also admitted that the competition regulator's investigation into Project Kangaroo, the broadband video joint venture with BBC Worldwide and Channel 4, meant there was now no chance the service would launch this year.</p> <p>\"As broadband video delivery continues to increase, we expect to see further internet video advertising growth, which our online properties will continue to exploit,\" the company said in its business review.</p> <p>ITV also took a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of \u00a31.6bn during the period against acquisitions in 2000 and 2004 that led to the creation of ITV plc.</p> <p>This led to an interim loss of \u00a31.54bn, down from a profit of \u00a3105m last year, although analysts have dismissed this and instead focused on the performance of ITV's ongoing businesses.</p> <p>Before the goodwill charge, operating profits at ITV fell 20% year on year from \u00a3151m to \u00a3121m for the period to the end of June.</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p>Strong life and pension sales helped boost first-half profits by 51% at Standard Life, which also benefited from a deal to reinsure annuity liabilities and reduce the financial risk posed by Britons living longer.</p> <p>The life insurer said today the outlook remained positive despite difficult market conditions. It raised its half-year dividend payout by 7% from last year to 4.07p a share - good news for the 1.5 million people who own shares in the company. When Standard Life demutualised in 2006 and floated on the stock market at 230p a share, policyholders received an average of 600 shares each.<br> Previously the UK insurer with the largest annuity book, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/standardlife\">Standard Life</a> struck a deal with Canada Life in February to reinsure \u00a36.7bn of its portfolio. This reduces the impact from people living longer and resulted in a one-off gain of \u00a3119m. Excluding this, profits were up 18%.</p> <p>The deal was the largest of its kind. \"When we demutualised we had a significant longevity exposure,\" said the finance director, David Nish. \"This is the strategy we've been pursuing for the last two to three years to get our risk position much more in balance.\" </p> <p>Other pension providers are also tackling this problem: in May <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jun/01/investing.regulators\">Friends Provident </a>moved part of its pension scheme to Norwich Union, Britain's largest insurer, in a \u00a3350m deal. And Scottish Widows, the insurance arm of Lloyds TSB, is currently in talks with a number of insurers to reinsure its \u00a36bn annuity portfolio.</p> <p>\"There is a market for it,\" said Nish, adding that Standard Life had several proposals and feels it got a good commercial deal.</p> <p>Operating profits before tax climbed to \u00a3534m in the first six months of the year, from \u00a3353m a year earlier. </p> <p>\"I am pleased to report that Standard Life has had a successful first half in 2008, despite more difficult market conditions,\" said the chief executive, Sandy Crombie.</p> <p>Like other insurers which have seen the value of their investments drop because of the slump in stock markets, Standard Life reported a decline in funds under management of 4%. </p> <p>But it enjoyed strong growth in its core insurance business, with life and pensions sales worldwide up 5% to \u00a39.1bn. Sales in the UK were down 1% at \u00a37.2bn, and fell 28% in Europe, but Canada put in a strong performance with 45% growth. In Britain, which accounts for three-quarters of the firm's business, life and pensions net inflows fell by 3% to \u00a31.4bn. </p> <p>\"There are a number of challenges to the UK business. It will continue to be a difficult market,\" said Crombie, pointing to the slump in consumer confidence, the deepening housing downturn and \"quite wildly fluctuating\" stock markets. But he added that Standard Life is less affected than others as it operates at the upper end of the market.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jul/31/avivabusiness.insurance\">Norwich Union parent Aviva</a> has posted just 1% growth in sales of investment and pension products in Britain, and also warned that the market would slow further.</p> <p>Standard Life is still searching for a new head of its UK retail business after Trevor Matthews quit to join Friends Provident as chief executive. This will take time, Crombie said, hinting it could be months before an appointment is made. He refused to answer questions about his own retirement plans.</p> <p>Shares in Standard Life dropped 7.75p to 236.5p this afternoon, a fall of 3.2%, after rising strongly yesterday ahead of the results.</p> <p>The group has taken measures to reduce its mortgage exposure, which resulted in gross mortgage lending dropping 54% to \u00a3728m. At 0.24%, its arrears rate is well below the industry average.</p> <p>Business at the insurer's joint ventures in Asia is booming. Sales in India climbed by 33% to \u00a3233m, sales in China more than doubled to \u00a342m and, in Hong Kong, sales jumped by 340% to \u00a318m. Asia now makes up about 5% of Standard Life's business, a level that is set to increase further.</p> <p>Analysts described Standard Life's performance as \"resilient\" in a challenging environment. Barrie Cornes at Panmure Gordon said: \"Overall the figures are ahead of expectations, driven by new business sales, primarily in Canada.\" <br></p>",
  "<p>Is it a blip, or is the tide going out? After 30 years when it seemed that nothing could reverse the glacially slow yet inexorable progress towards a world where it was taken for granted that women and men would have equality in their life and work, academics at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/aug/06/equality.gender\">Cambridge</a> have found that support for the idea that mothers can go out to work without harming their families is falling, and support for the view that men are the breadwinners and women the carers is rising. </p> <p>What is going on? Lacking the resources (not to mention the skills) to organise the kind of global survey that underpins these findings, one can only look around and take a wild guess. And when you look around, you see the following: young women leaving school or university with grades as good as their male peers but choosing to take lower-paid work, because they don't see pay as a kind of virility symbol and anyway they aren't too worried about virility symbols.</p> <p>You see little change in who does what at home. And financial pressure, now allied with financial insecurity, is leading to desperate anxiety about paying the bills and keeping the job, which equals ever-longer hours at the coalface. This is not an environment for people with major responsibilities outside the workplace. And that's still women, women with children and women with elderly parents.</p> <p>This is an unfinished revolution. Great leaps towards equality have been taken in my working lifetime, but only in the abstract. Now, young men and women set off at least superficially from the same starting line. But 10 years on in their lives, progress towards father's and mother's equality, the fair division of work and caring, is almost non-existent.</p> <p>Maybe that's unkind. It's great that there's now paternity leave, and serious progress on ideas about sharing parental leave between parents. Less great that it relies on employers to make it a financially sensible option. All the same, the legislation of the past 10 years has cleared a narrow path towards the sunlit uplands of genuine equality.</p> <p>But there are plenty of elephant traps along the way. As Nicola Brewer, chief executive of the new <a href=\"http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/aboutus/whoweare/pages/whoweare.aspx\">Equalities and Human Rights Commission</a>, warned in an interview recently, there is a real risk that the legislation intended to protect and promote gender equality will end up with too many employers finding reasons for not taking on women of child bearing age, while extending maternity leave merely reinforces notions of gender segregation.</p> <p>For all the nominal gains, women are actually little nearer genuine equality than they were in the 1980s. We have fought, and we have not won. Partly, that's because a lot of us still expect too little of ourselves. But maybe something else, something more positive, is going on here too. It was a cliche of 1980s sociology that when the costs of motherhood became apparent, then fewer women would want to become mothers. </p> <p>A generation on, women and men are beginning to reverse the argument, to point out the rewards and responsibilities of parenthood, and the need for carers in society. We may still be years behind northern Europe, but slowly it is dawning on us all that bringing up the kids is an amazingly important (and rewarding) thing to do, precious beyond the pay packet. The more complex and important a task child-rearing is understood to be, the more one parent is going to want to forsake their full-on career in order to stay home, at least some of the time. </p> <p>Since the idea of real equality in the workplace probably has at least another generation to go before it is a reality, and other <a href=\"http://www.genet.ac.uk/workpapers/GeNet2006p21.pdf\">work (pdf)</a> by Professor Jacqueline Scott, who edited the book published today, has underlined the resilience of traditional attitudes to families, it's the mothers who are assumed, not least by themselves, to be responsible for the caring bit. </p> <p>One day that will change. But for the time being, it may be the reason why attitudes appear to have gone into reverse: people have understood the question in a different way.

  "<p>Images of the Beijing skyline seemingly bathed in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/06/olympics2008.china\">a soup of smog and haze</a> have been a common sight on the world's TV screens in recent days and weeks. Foreign journalists with handheld air pollution detectors have been popping up on street corners checking levels of soot and dust. Everyone seems keen to prove that the city's air will be a decisive and debilitating factor for one of the world's most high-profile sporting events. </p> <p>Without doubt Beijing is facing a huge challenge. There are real and understandable concerns for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/feedarticle/7701776\">health of competitors</a>, especially those in endurance and long-distance events such as cycling and the marathon. </p> <p>But the current frenzied focus is marked by considerable amnesia. After all, air pollution was a major concern in <a href=\"http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/olympics_blog/2008/07/another-time-an.html\">Los Angeles</a> 24 years ago, though few now seem to recall the dramatic scene at the end of the women's marathon, when the Swiss competitor was seen staggering and stumbling from exhaustion, the heat, and, perhaps, the effects of air pollution. And air quality was also an issue for subsequent Olympic games in Barcelona, Atlanta, Seoul, and Athens. </p> <p>So the debate about the Beijing games deserves more fair play than it has received. <br>Indeed, real and, one hopes, long-lasting achievements have been made by the Beijing organising committee for the Olympic games, the city as a whole, the government, and the six provinces concerned. This is all the more remarkable when set against the city's double-digit economic growth and the fact that the games are being staged in a developing country, with all the social, economic, health, and environmental challenges this entails. </p> <p>For example, some 200 polluting factories have been closed, switched to new kinds of cleaner production, or moved out of the city over the past seven years. Moreover, as a result of a $17bn investment, more than 90% of the city's wastewater is now treated, more than 50% of the city is forested, and natural gas accounts for more than 60% of energy generation, up from roughly 45% in 2000. </p> <p>Meanwhile, eight new railway lines, covering 200 kilometers and with a daily capacity of close to four million people, have become operational this year, alongside 60km of bus lines. New vehicle emission standards meet the most stringent equivalent European standards, and are higher than in the United States. <br>In addition, 50,000 old taxis and 10,000 buses have been replaced, and 4,000 of the new buses are powered by natural gas \u2013 now the largest fleet of its kind in the world. In recent days, the authorities have also requested businesses to stagger the working day before, during, and after the games to reduce traffic volumes, alongside a raft of other traffic-cutting measures. </p> <p>Then there is the attention to eco-detail at the Olympic venues themselves, including the 400,000-square metre Olympic village, where water reclaimed from the <a href=\"http://en.beijing2008.cn/cptvenues/venues/headlines/n214262720.shtml\">Qinghe sewage treatment plant</a> is being used for heating and cooling systems, resulting in an estimated 60% savings in electricity consumption. </p> <p>Only time will tell if all these measures will bring air pollution down to acceptable levels. The UN <a href=\"http://www.unep.org/\">environment programme</a> will certainly make this a focus of its post-games report, building on the initial one issued in 2007. </p> <p>But it is clear that Beijing is striving to be part of the Green Team, embracing environmental standards that are now central to the modern Olympic movement, and that are increasingly part of other big sporting events, such as the <a href=\"http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jul2006/2006-07-03-02.asp\">green goals</a> for the 2006 and 2010 Fifa World Cups. </p> <p>Increased public awareness, the ability to showcase new and more sustainable ways of managing an urban setting, and the legacy of more environmentally friendly energy, transport systems, and other infrastructure should also not be underestimated. </p> <p>Humanity is currently engaged in a far-reaching and urgent competition that pits the need to embed a 21st century \"green economy\" against the rapid implosion of our climate and natural life-support systems. The catalytic and inspirational possibilities of events like the Olympics thus have a wider role to play, one that might just help prevent us from staggering and collapsing under the weight of our environmental degradation.</p> <p>Copyright: <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\">Project Syndicate, 2008</a></p>",
  "<p>Another day, another data scandal. Millions of consumers have had their details stolen by an international gang of hackers. Another reminder that anything that makes transactions easier also makes them more risky. Even in the USA, the land of the ID card.</p> <p>This weekend I was on a street stall outside Islington farmers' market with other supporters of <a href=\"http://www.no2id.net/\">NO2ID</a>. Farmers' markets are the antithesis of the global, electronic marketplace. Face-to-face transactions, hand-grown produce handed over in exchange for hard cash, dealing directly with the producer - a welcome exception to the online, supermarketed, call-centre world in which we now live. So a perfect place to raise the ID card question. </p> <p>Despite the showery weather, a steady stream of people, some already armed with soft fruit and handmade cheese, lined up to sign our petition or debate the issue. We're finding that more and more people are backing the campaign; they just don't buy the idea of a massive, flawless, and wholly secure database. Disasters like <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7530180.stm\">the loss of 3,000 blank passports</a> don't help. </p> <p>I've been opposed to ID cards from day one. It's not just <a href=\"http://www.libdems.org.uk/noidcards/\">my gut objections as a Liberal Democrat to the loss of freedom</a>. As a software professional in my day job, I know both the benefits and weaknesses that any database brings. Ideological objections aside, uniting financial, legal and health records, plus biometric data, on every citizen, will require a monster of a system. What happens when everyone tries to swipe their cards at once? Try hiring a car on the first day of term, or renewing a prescription on election day. </p> <p>The government could argue that ID cards would make life more convenient, despite the risk, and offer an optional ID card, with citizens making an informed choice. Or they could argue that it's an inconvenient necessity in the face of terrorist threats, imposed to deal with national security. What is so dishonest is that government is claiming that ID cards will simultaneously make us safer <em>and</em> life easier - when the reality already shows that the opposite is the case. </p> <p>Add in the massive cost of the scheme - \u00a318bn and rising - and the question is not why so many people oppose ID cards, but why the government is still in favour.</p> <p>It's not as if existing systems are foolproof. A few weeks ago, I was heading out of London by train for a family celebration. We got waved through the barrier at King's Cross - \"a birthday present from Boris\" we joked - and thought no more about it. In fact we'd just avoided having our Oyster travel cards destroyed by a bug in the system. </p> <p>For anyone who lives or works in London, the Oyster card is now a fact of life. Like many others, I load mine up with pre-payment and try not to worry about my movements being tracked. Barclays have combined it with a cashcard; Oyster has even been used to provide alibis. We all love our Oyster cards - or did. </p> <p>But since the July 12 meltdown, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/jul/26/transport.london\">the Oyster network has failed again</a>. And there's also been the revelation on the internet of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/jun/26/hitechcrime.oystercards\">how to break the security of the Oyster chip</a>. It's a reality check that no matter how handy a smartcard is - and I wouldn't be without my Oyster - there's no 100% secure system. </p> <p>If the government does want to pay billions of our money to IT contractors, why not use it to make the existing systems up to scratch? </p> <p>An old joke goes that there are two universal lies: \"The cheque is in the post\" and \"I'm from the government and I'm here to help\". Just this week I had a desperate phone call from a woman caught in the twilight zone between different benefit claims. She'd phoned the benefits office, to be assured that her giro was in the post. It never arrived and she was running out of food money. </p> <p>Another visit to the office, and it turned out they'd sent it to a different address on the same street, despite all the forms she's filled in over the years. Ah the mighty power of the database state ...</p>",
  "<p>The moment of truth is at hand for US biofuels this week as environmental regulators prepare to rule on one state's request to halve the steep national target for blending ethanol into fuel.</p> <p>Texas governor Rick Perry asked the US environmental protection agency (EPA) in April to cut the national biofuels target 50% from its current level of 9bn gallons. After an unexpected delay last month, the EPA is expected to rule on Perry's waiver request as soon as this week.</p> <p>The waiver proposal has stoked a fierce political row over the future of biofuels, with some US politicians echoing their European counterparts in questioning whether ethanol's effect on food prices limits its usefulness as an alternative to traditional fuel.</p> <p>\"We need to put an end to flawed government policies that distort the markets, raise food prices artificially, and pit producers against consumers,\" senator John McCain said in May after he and 23 fellow Republicans endorsed an easing of the ethanol target. </p> <p>Three major environmental groups have even sided with the conservative governor \u2013 albeit with different motives than Perry, who sought the waiver to protect Texas livestock producers from rising corn prices. </p> <p>Suspending the biofuels target would allow the EPA the environmental sustainability of increased ethanol production, according to Friends of the Earth energy policy campaigner Kate McMahon.</p> <p>\"This biofuels mandate essentially dictates inaction on climate change by taking us in a useless and potentially harmful direction,\" McMahon said in a statement last month.</p> <p>Yet powerful supporters of increased ethanol production hail from nearly every corn-producing state in the US, including an Illinois senator named Barack Obama. In his energy plan released this week, the Democratic presidential nominee sets a 60bn-gallon target within 22 years for advanced biofuels, including cellulosic ethanol.</p> <p>The ethanol industry's US trade group, the Renewable Fuels Association (RFA), asserts that the carbon footprint of ethanol \u2013 already lower than that of conventional petrol \u2013 will only decrease as the ethanol target encourages the development of advanced biofuel.</p> <p>\"We're doing everything we can, as efficiently as we can, to bring those technologies to the marketplace,\" RFA spokesman Matt Hartwig said. </p> <p>\"But if you go in and undermine the foundation of the ethanol industry today, you'll set back the development of those next-generation technologies.\"</p> <p>That more and more US corn is being diverted to make ethanol is not in dispute. The US agriculture department estimates that 25% of the nation's corn crop, valued at $52.1bn, was used for fuel last year. That number could rise as high as 35% this year.</p> <p>But the ethanol industry argues that high oil prices, not biofuels, are to blame for food prices that have risen far faster than inflation. </p> <p>Only one-quarter of recent US corn price increases are attributable to the ethanol tax credit \u2013 recently reduced by Congress from 51 cents to 45 cents per gallon \u2013 according to a Purdue University study commissioned by the Farm Foundation.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jul/03/biofuels.renewableenergy\">confidential World Bank report</a> obtained by the Guardian last month, however, tagged biofuels as the cause of a 75% rise in worldwide food prices.</p> <p>The EPA's delay in ruling on the Texas waiver request, which sparked more than 15,000 public comments to the agency, raised concerns among those on both sides of the biofuels battle. </p> <p>Eight senators from corn-producing states publicly warned EPA administrator Stephen Johnson against \"any agreements being made behind closed doors\". </p> <p>Meanwhile, some commodity watchers predicted that falling corn prices this summer would give the agency grounds to deny the waiver.</p> <p>No matter what the EPA decides in coming days, the battle may not end right away. Biofuels supporters are likely to challenge any potential waiver in court, and Perry appears to have laid the groundwork for a lawsuit against the agency if his request is denied.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://carboncontrolnews.com/\">Carbon Control News</a>, Perry wrote in comments to the EPA that the law requires a waiver of the ethanol target \"whenever [Johnson] is able to make a reasonable determination that a major sacrifice would flow from the implementation of the mandates\".</p>",
  "<p>If Gordon Brown had his head screwed on, he'd just scribble a quick note saying something like:</p> <blockquote> <p>Dear British Public, </p> <p>Well sod the lot of you.

He's been able to spend all his time on the one political issue that he really cares about and people like him. Doesn't that sound a lot more fun than hanging round sweeping up the detritus of the Blair years?</p> <p>Of course, the people's Al had the good fortune to never actually get the big job, but come on Gordon, you've only had a year, the taint can't be that bad. Tell 'em all to pound sand, grow a beard, then naff off to Kirkcaldy for 10 years and come back with a PowerPoint lecture about African land tenure reform or whatever and the kids will greet you as a messiah. Or at the very least, you can amuse yourself by doing the college lecture circuit spraying a little bit of poison over the Reverend Tony's retirement plan. Or get a blog or something, or clean up at <a href=\" http://politicalbetting.com/\">politicalbetting.com</a>. Anything's got to be better than this.</p> <p>I suspect that what's holding Gordon back is that he's short of a <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/sep/29/dontjustdosomethingstandt\">Big Idea</a>; there's nothing that he both knows and cares about as much as Al Gore cares about global warming.</p> <p>It's not really his fault \u2013 the UK is a parliamentary rather than a presidential system, and chancellor of the exchequer, unlike vice president of the US, is a proper full-time job, so Gordon hasn't had a load of spare time to develop a deep interest and knowledge in the makings of the internet or climate change or anything else beyond the minutiae of economic policy.</p> <p>And given that nobody really gives a wet slap about making the Bank of England independent or anything else which he actually did, he's been left poring over <a href=\" http://www.amazon.co.uk/Courage-Eight-Portraits-Gordon-Brown/dp/0747565325\">old Bono lyrics</a> and the <a href=\" http://www.amazon.co.uk/BritaIns-Everyday-Heroes-Gordon-Brown/dp/1845963075/ref=pd_sim_b_2\">back end of the Wednesday Guardian</a> just to try and fulfil a publishing contract. Sheesh.</p> <p>It almost makes you feel sorry for the guy. I'm sure that as a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/04/davidmiliband.gordonbrown\">16-year-old schoolboy</a> bursting with son-of-the-manse socialism, he was a perfect wee charmer. I'm equally sure that he's pretty much sincere when he talks about inequality, or education or international development and atrocious though those books were, I'm sure they were genuinely meant. On the other hand, as Quentin Crisp said: \"It's no good running a pig farm badly for 30 years while saying, 'Really, I was meant to be a ballet dancer.' By then, pigs will be your style.\"</p> <p>The real wrong turn in British politics (and David Cameron fans, don't get too smug, your guy will go this way too and sooner rather than later if BorisLand is anything to go by) was when people started talking about \"public services\" and pretending that the entire country could be run on the model of a local authority recreation department, by contracting out all the major functions and using questionnaires and focus groups to decide the agenda for the next budget period. The gutting of the professional civil service wasn't an unintended consequence; the idea was that the agency/PFI model would be a brighter and better, more 21st-century way to get the bins emptied.</p> <p>They didn't notice that outsourcing rarely works as you want it to in any context, and that the practical effect of the new \"public services agenda\" would be that the work programme was set by a mixture of greed and careerism, and that \"choice\" would become a euphemism for bogus consultation exercises aimed at reconciling the amount that the private sector wanted to suck out of the public purse with the amount that could realistically be sucked into it. Meanwhile, the political class played at CEO fantasy camp and blamed the resulting massive ideological void at the heart of our government on the existence of 24-hour rolling news (no, me neither).</p> <p>Gordon Brown was a central part of this \u2013 he was a big fan of PFI, and bought into corporate-speak earlier and heavier than any of them. All the way along, he and his advisers genuinely believed that they were putting together a radical policy agenda that would shape the future, and drive a sea-change in the relationship between the individual and the state.</p> <p>For all that time, I genuinely believe that they thought a moment would come when they'd unveil a stunning set of policies and transform the lives of the least well-off, before moving on to foreign policy. But in fact, after all those years spent playing the technocrat and trying to take the politics out of everyday life, it seems to me that Gordon doesn't even have a single big political concept to take with him back into post-political life, and will probably end up being prudent and Byronic on the board of some multinational company. Pigs are now his style.</p>",
  "<p>Frequent infestations of rats, mice, fleas, bedbugs, ants and cockroaches plague most NHS hospitals in England, figures released today show.</p> <p>More than two-thirds (70%) of NHS trusts brought in pest controllers at least 50 times over the past two years to combat outbreaks of vermin in wards, clinics and even operating theatres, according to figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.</p> <p>There were almost 20,000 incidents of pest infestation in hospitals between January 2006 and March this year, the figures obtained by the Conservatives reveal. The outbreaks included rats in maternity wards, wasps and fleas in neonatal units and maggots in patients' slippers. </p> <p>The figures show four-fifths (80%) of NHS trusts reported problems with ants, two-thirds (66%) with rats and more than three-quarters (77%) with mice. </p> <p>Cockroaches were said to have been reported at 59% of trusts, fleas or other biting insects at two-thirds (65%), and bed bugs at nearly a quarter (24%). A further 6% of trusts reported infestations of maggots.</p> <p>The Patients Association described the situation as revolting and said it threatened patient safety. The government said the risk to patients was \"negligible\" and played down fears that infestations of vermin were linked to the spread of hospital superbugs such as MRSA.</p> <p>All 171 NHS trusts in England were asked to detail pest infestations by the Conservatives. Of the 127 that responded, almost all said they had experienced some problems. </p> <p>The shadow health secretary, Andrew Lansley, said: \"Labour have said over and over again that they will improve cleanliness in our hospitals but these figures clearly show that they are failing. </p> <p>\"It is difficult for health service estates to maintain a completely pest-free environment but the level and variety of these infections is concerning. We need greater transparency in NHS infection control, and publishing data like this is one way in which we can drive up overall hygiene standards.\" </p> <p>Vanessa Bourne, of the Patients Association, said: \"Such findings are truly revolting. How can patients be safe amid bed bugs, fleas and rats? Once again safety is just rhetoric and not a reality for patients, particularly the elderly and those with suppressed immunity. </p> <p>\"What about those trusts who ignored this freedom of information request and said nothing? If these are the standards of those coming clean, what does it say about those who stayed silent? These findings reveal what happens when money is taken away from where patients expect to see it spent. If these hospitals were restaurants they would be closed down and out of business. [NHS] trust boards must get a grip and show patients they are serious about their legal responsibility for safety.\" </p> <p>Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, which had the highest number of pest incidents over the period (see list below), said the figure reflected the fact that it was the fourth-largest trust in the country. John Simpson, the trust's director of estates and facilities management, said it was not fair to compare its figures with those of smaller trusts, which were likely to have smaller-scale pest problems. </p> <p>Portsmouth Hospitals NHS trust, which had the third most incidents, said the figure reflected how seriously staff regarded pest control. </p> <p>\"Common calls in Portsmouth are to deal with ants or, being a coastal city, dead seagulls or pigeons in the grounds,\" a spokeswoman said. \"The number of help-desk calls is not a reflection on cleanliness in our hospitals, more a recognition that we do not procrastinate with our response.\"</p> <p>Christine Braithwaite, the head of the healthcare associated infection programme at the Healthcare Commission, said concerns around pest control in hospitals \"have, to date, been negligible\".</p> <p>Ivan Lewis, the health minister, said it was up to NHS trusts to ensure hospitals were clean and safe for patients. He said there was little evidence of any threat to patient safety. </p> <p>\"The use of pest control is seen as good, proactive management,\" he said. \"The claim that insects spread hospital-acquired infections is entirely unproven. There is no evidence of their carriage of antibiotic-resistant bacteria being a hazard to patients. Despite this, we expect hospitals to take continued action to tackle these pest problems.\"</p> <p>Malcolm Padley, a spokesman for Rentokil, which provides pest control for hospitals, said some pests could be brought in by patients. \"We have definitely seen an increase in the number of callouts about bed bugs and rodents nationally. A lot of people could be going into hospitals with bed bugs on their clothing.\"</p> <p><strong>The 10 NHS trusts that called in pest controllers most often between January 2006 and April 2008: </strong></p> <p>1. Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust: 1,070 incidents <br>2. Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust: 898 incidents <br>3. Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust: 857 incidents <br>4.

The soundtrack to the movie, featuring Snoop Doggy Dogg (who also makes a cameo) is already a big hit</p> <p>This week, however, I had to watch another piece of transcontinental trash that wasn't half as good as Singh is destined to be. Mission Istaanbul is fantastically awful. It's a product of a Bollywood machine that assumes that Indians have a subnormal intelligence and will watch anything. About 80% of all films made here are complete flops. The industry churns out a dizzying number of films, hoping that one will become the blockbuster that makes up for the rest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336251744\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/08/05/mission-istanbul-wallpaper2460.jpg\" alt=\"Mission Istanbul\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Zayed Khan plays Vikas Sagar, a journalist with ridiculously bouncy Pantene hair, who will \"go anywhere for a story\". Wanting to give his shiny bouffant the maximum global exposure, and get away from a pestering ex-wife who keeps wanting a baby, he leaves India, where millions watch his weekly news show, to join Al Johara, a news network based in Turkey. His decision to leave his wife is hammered into the viewers' head with an excruciatingly long series of musical flashbacks, underlining the fact that, despite his hairstyle, Vikas is a really deep and soulful guy. Apparently Indians won't tolerate him leaving her woman simply because she's an irritating cow. His decision has be the result of a tortuous spiritual crisis.</p> <p>On the plane there, he sits next to the lovely Lisa Libo, with whom he gets on like a house on fire. But, being a complete berk, he doesn't ask for her number when they land, being too concerned with conditioning his hair after a long flight.</p> <p>Al Johara turns out to be a slick operation and Vikas seems to love it there, despite being warned to never visit the \"catacomb\" on the 13th floor. Vivek watches some news footage about a terrorist attack, and realises that terrorism is REALLY BAD and that Al Johara might be mixed up in it. But when he tries to leave, a Turkish commando called Rizwan Khan tells him, in perfect Hindi, that everyone else who tried to leave the firm has ended up as samosa filling. But the 13th floor isn't what its cracked up to be and Rizwan breaks into it and installs a virus into its system. From then on the film turns into an action frenzy as Vikas fights Abu Nazir, the man behind Al Johara and mastermind of ALL international terrorism who's planning to kill EVERYONE IN THE WORLD \u2013 including himself.</p> <p>Decent enough though its special effects and chase scenes were, the movie still had me gnawing on my tongue to stay awake. The worst thing about bad Bollywood films is that however awful they must appear in the editing process, their makers insist on them being at least two-and-half hours long. They think the public wants its money's worth, when the truth is they would happily pay to escape them. For the last half of this movie, I was prepared to gouge out my eyes to spare myself.</p> <p>The dialogue is unbearable. The baddie kidnaps the goodie's girlfriend as bait. \"I'll never tell you the secret information,\" she squeals under torture. \"I'm so sorry,\" says her boyfriend. \"Today you will all see God,\" says the villain. Those were among the better lines.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336251745\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/08/05/mission-istanbul-wallpaper1460.jpg\" alt=\"Mission Istanbul\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The movie's macho posturing is undone by the camp, formulaic, hip-swaying musical routines in which the men lose all credibility as they mince their way through them. None of the songs are any good, and no one has any fun with them, performing the scenes with absurdly straight faces.</p> <p>This film is histrionic, idiotic and so boring it gave me a headache. Given that 50 people in three Indian cities have recently died in terrorist attacks, you'd think that Bollywood might be prepared to discuss the issue with some gravitas. Watching this film, that moment looks a long way off.</p>",
